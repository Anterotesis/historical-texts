            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Yea, it is granted also that Persons ought to <hi>chuse</hi> what Churches they will joyn themselves unto, wherein they may have the best advan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This it is supposed is the Liberty and Duty of every Man; for if it be not so, it is the foolishest thing in the World, for any to attempt to get others <hi>from one Church unto another</hi>; which is almost the whole business of Religion, that some think themselves concerned to attend unto.</p>
            <p>But yet notwithstanding these Conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, when things come to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For besides that it is not a Church of Divine Institution, that is intended in these Concessions, when it comes unto the issue, where a Man is born, and in what Church he is Baptized in his Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, there all <hi>choice is prevented,</hi> and in the Communion of that Church he is to abide, on the penalties of being esteemed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106207:3"/>
and dealt with as a <hi>Schismatick.</hi> In what <hi>National Church</hi> any person is baptized, in that <hi>National Church</hi> he is to continue, or answer the contrary at his peril. And in the <hi>Precincts of what Parish</hi> his Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation falls to be, in that particular <hi>Parish Church</hi> is he bound to Communicate in all Ordinances of Worship. I say, in the judgment of many, whatever is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>of mens j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>yning themselves unto the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and purest Churches,</hi> there is no Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Judgment or Practice in either of these things left unto any of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Christ</p>
            <p>Wherefore the <hi>Liberty and Duty</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, being the Foundation of all orderly <hi>Evangelical Profession,</hi> and that wherein the Consciences of Believers are greatly concerned, I shall lay down one Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition wherein 'tis asserted, in the sence I intend, and then fully confirm it.</p>
            <p>The Proposition it self is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is the duty of every one who professeth Faith in Christ Jesus, and takes due care of his own Eternal Salvation, voluntarily and by his own choice to joyn himself unto some particular Congregation of Christs Institution, for his own Spiritual Edification, and the right discharge of his Commands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. THIS Duty is prescribed (1.) unto them only who <hi>profess Faith in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:106207:4"/>
who own themselves to be his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that call Jesus Lord. For this is the <hi>method</hi> of the Gospel, that first men by the Preaching of it be made <hi>Disciples,</hi> or be brought unto Faith in Christ Jesus, and then be taught to do and observe whatever he commands, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18, 19, 20. first to believe, and then to be added unto the Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41, 42, 46, 47. Men must first <hi>joyn themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord,</hi> or give up themselves unto him, before they can give up themselves unto the Church, according to the mind of Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. We are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concerned at present as unto them, who either not at all profess Faith in Christ Jesus, or else through ignorance of the Fundamental Principles of Religion, and wickedness of Life, do d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stroy or utterly render useless that Profession. We do not say it is the duty of such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that is, their <hi>immediate duty,</hi> in the state wherein they are, to joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto any Church. Nay, it is the duty of every Church, to refuse them their Communion, whilst they abide in that state. There are other duties to be in the first place pressed on them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may be made meet for this. So in the Primitive times, although in the extraordinary Conversions unto Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106207:4"/>
that were made among the <hi>Jews,</hi> who before belonged unto <hi>Gods Covenant,</hi> they were all immediately added unto the Church, yet afterwards, in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way of the Conversion of men, the Churches did not immediately admit them into <hi>compleat Communion,</hi> but kept them as <hi>Catechumeners,</hi> for the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>crease of their knowledge, and trial of their profession, until they were judged meet to be joyned unto the Church. And they are not to blame who receive not such into <hi>compleat Communion</hi> with them, unto whom it is not a present duty to desire that Communion. Yea, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of such persons into Church-Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, much more the compelling of them to be Members of this or that Church, almost wheth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r they will or no, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the rule of the Word, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Primitive Church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, and a great expedient to harden men in their sins.</p>
            <p>We do therefore avow, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not admit any into our <hi>Church Societies,</hi> as to compleat Membership, and actual Interest in the priviledges of the Church, who do not, by a <hi>profession of Faith</hi> in, and obedience unto Jesus Christ, no way contradicted by sins of life, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest themselves to be such, as whose
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106207:5"/>
duty it is, to joyn themselves unto any Church. Neither do we injure any <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Persons hereby,</hi> or oppose any of their Right unto, and Interest in the Church, but only as they did universally in the Primitive Churches, after the death of the Apostles, we <hi>direct them into that way and method,</hi> wherein they may be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unto the glory of Christ, and their own edification. And we do therefore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that we will never deny that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion unto any person, high or low, rich or poor, old or young, male or fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, <hi>whose duty it is to desire it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. IT is added in the description of the Subject, That it is <hi>such an one who takes due care of his own Salvation.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny there are who profess themselves to be Christians, who it may be hear the word willingly, and do many things glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet do not esteem themselves obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged unto a diligent enquiry into, and a precise observation of all the commands of Christ. But it is such whom we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, who constantly fix their minds on the enjoyment of God, as their chiefest good and utmost end, who thereon due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consider the means of attaining it, and apply themselves thereunto. And it is to be feared, that the number of such persons will not be found to be <hi>very
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106207:5"/>
great in the world</hi>; which is sufficient to take off the reproach from some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Congregations of the smalness of their number. Such they ever were, and such is it foretold that they should be. Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was never yet esteemed a note of the true Church, by any but those, whose worldly interest it is that it should so be; yet at present <hi>absolutely</hi> in these Nati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ns, the number of such persons is not small.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Of these persons it is said, that <hi>it is their duty so to dispose of themselves.</hi> It is not that which they may do, as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, or an advantage; not that which others may do for them, but which they <hi>must do</hi> for themselves in a way of duty. It is an <hi>Obediential Act</hi> unto the commands of Christ; whereunto is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired subjection of Conscience unto his Authority, Faith in his promises, as also a respect unto an appeara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The way of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to compel men into their Communion, and keep them in it, by <hi>fire and fagot,</hi> or any other means of external force, derives more from the <hi>Alcoran</hi> than the <hi>Gospel.</hi> Neither doth ir answer the mind of Christ in the Institution, End, and Order of Church-Societies, that men should become Members of them, partly by that which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106207:6"/>
is no way in their own power, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by what their wills are regulated in, by the Laws of men. For it is, as was said, commonly esteemed, that men being <hi>born</hi> and <hi>baptized</hi> in such a Nation, are t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ereby made members of the Church of that Nation; and by living within such <hi>Parochial Precincts,</hi> as the Law of the Land hath Arbitrarily established, are members of this or that particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. At least they are accounted so far to belong unto these Churches, as to render them liable unto all <hi>outward punishments,</hi> that shall be thought meet to be inflicted on them, who comply not with them. So far as these perswasions and actings according unto them, do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, so far are they destructive of the principal foundation of the external Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Order of the Church. But that mens joyning themselves in, or unto any Church Society, is, or ought to be, a <hi>voluntary act,</hi> or an act of free choice, in mere obedience unto the Authority and commands of Christ, is so sacred a truth, so evident in the Scripture, so necessary from its subject matter, so testifyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the practice of all the first Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; as that it despiseth all opposition. And I know not how any can reconcile the common practice of giving men the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106207:6"/>
reputation or reality of being <hi>Members of,</hi> or belonging unto this or that Church, as unto total Communion, <hi>who desire or chuse no such thing,</hi> unto this acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed principle.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THERE is a <hi>double jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

An <hi>adherence unto the Church,</hi> as unto the means of Instruction and Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to be attained thereby. So per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons may <hi>adhere unto any Church,</hi> who yet are not meet, or free on some present consideration, to confederate with it, as unto total Communion; see <hi>Act.</hi> 5.13, 14. And of this sort in a peculiar manner, are the <hi>baptized Children</hi> of the members of the Church. For although they are not capable of performing Church duties, or enjoying Church-priviledges in their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der years; nor can have a right unto to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Communion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before the testification of their own <hi>voluntary corsent</hi> thereunto, and choice thereof; yet are they in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner under the care and inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Church, so far as the outward administration of the Covenant in all the means of it, is committed thereunto; and their duty it is, according to their capacity, to attend unto the <hi>Ministry</hi> of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106207:7"/>
that Church whereunto they do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.</p>
            <p n="6">6. THE Proposition respects a <hi>visible professing Church.</hi> And I intend such a Church in general, as avoweth Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from Christ; (1.) For the <hi>Min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To <hi>give a publick testimony</hi> against the Devil and the World, not contradicting their profession with any corrupt Principles or Practices inconsistent with it. What is required in particular, that any of them may be meet to be joyned unto such a Church, we shall afterwards enquire.</p>
            <p n="7">7. IT is generally said, that <hi>out of the Church there is no Salvation</hi>; and the truth hereof is testified unto in the Scriptures, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.47. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.20, 21. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.26, 27. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.16.</p>
            <p n="8">8. THIS is true both positively and negatively of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of the Elect: All that are of it shall be saved; and none shall be saved but those that belong unto it, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.25, 26, 27. Of the <hi>Catholick visible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing Church negatively</hi>; that no Adult person can be saved, that doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto this Church, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:106207:7"/>9. THIS <hi>Position of Truth</hi> is abused by Interest and Pride; an enclosure of it being made by them, who of all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the World can lay the least and weakest claim unto it; namely, the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> For they are so far from being that <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> out of which there is no Salvation, and wherein none can perish, like the <hi>Ark of Noah,</hi> that it requires the highest charity to reckon them unto that <hi>visible professing Church,</hi> whereof the greatest part may perish; and do so undoubtedly.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Our enquiry is, what truth there is in this Assertion, with respect unto these <hi>particular Churches or Societies,</hi> for the celebration of Gospel-worship and Discipline, whereof we treat. And I say,</p>
            <p n="1">1. No Church, of what <hi>den<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es of their way alone. And after many false charges of it on others, it begins really to be renewed in our d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ys. For some dispute, that Salvation is confined unto that Church alone, wherein there is a <hi>Succession of Diocesan Bishops</hi>; which is the height of <hi>Donatism.</hi> The Judgments and Determinations made concerning the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106207:8"/>
Eternal Salvation or Damnation of Men, by the measures of some differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Christians about Churches, their State and Order, are <hi>absurd, foolish, and impious,</hi> and for the most part used by them, who sufficiently preclaim, that they know neither what it is to be saved, nor do use any diligence about the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary means of it. Salvation depends <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely</hi> on no particular Church-state in the world; he knows not the Gospel, who can really think it doth. Persons of Believers are not for the Church, but the Church is for them: if the <hi>Ministry of Angels</hi> be for them who are Heirs of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, much more is the Ministry of the Church so. If a man be an Adulterer, an Idolater, a Rayler, a hater and <hi>scoffer of Godliness</hi>; if he choose <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That although the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this or that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or any particular Church in the world, will not <hi>secure the Salvation</hi> of any men; yet the adherence unto <hi>some Churches,</hi> or such as are so called, in their constitution and worship, may prejudice, yea, ruine the Salvation of any that shall so do. (2.) The choice of what Church we will joyn unto, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto the choice and use of the means for our Edification. And he that makes no conscience hereof, but merely with r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>spect unto the event of being saved at last, will probably come short thereof,</p>
            <p n="2">2. ON this Supposition, that there be no insuperable difficulties lying in the way of the discharge of this duty, as that a person be cast by the providence of God into such a place or season, as wherein there <hi>is no Church</hi> that he can possibly joyn himself unto, or that he be unjustly refused Communion, by <hi>unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable conditions</hi> of it, as it was with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106207:9"/>
many during the preval<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ncy of the <hi>Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> in all the <hi>Western Empire</hi>; it is the <hi>indisp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nsible duty</hi> of every Disciple of Christ, in order unto his Edification and Salvation, voluntarily, and of his own choice, to joyn himself in and unto some <hi>particular congregation,</hi> for the Celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of divine Worship, and the due ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of all the Institutions and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Christ; which we shall now farther confirm.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE foundation of this duty, as was before declared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth lye in <hi>the law and light of Nature.</hi> Man cannot exercise the principal powers and faculties of his Soul, with which he was created, and whereby he is enabled to glorifie God, which is the end of him and them, without a consent and conjunction in the Worship of God in Communion and Society, as hath been proved before.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The way whereby this is to be done, God hath declared and revealed from the beginning, by the Constitution of a <hi>Church-state,</hi> through the addition of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Institutions of worship, unto what was r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>quired by the Law of Nature. For this gives the true state, and is the formal reason of a <hi>Church,</hi> namely, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Addition of Arbitrary Institutions of worship, unto the necessary Dictates of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106207:9"/>
the Law of Nature, unto that end. And the especial nature of any <hi>Church-state,</hi> doth depend on the especial nature of those Institutions, which is constitutive of the difference between the <hi>Church-state</hi> of the Old Testament and that of the New.</p>
            <p n="3">3. SUCH a <hi>Church-state</hi> was constituted and appointed under the Old Testament, founded in and on an <hi>especial Covenant</hi> between God and the People, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. Unto this <hi>Church</hi> every one that would please God, and walk before him, was bound to joyn himself, by the ways and means that he had appointed for that end; namely, by <hi>Circumcision, and their laying hold on the Covenant of God, Exod.</hi> 12.48. <hi>Isa.</hi> 56.4. And this joyning unto the <hi>Church,</hi> is called <hi>joyning unto the Lord, Isa.</hi> 56.6. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 50.5. as being the means thereof; without which it could not be done. Herein was the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of God with men, and he dwelt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. AS a new <hi>Church-state</hi> is prophesied of under the New Testament. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.25, 26, 27. <hi>Isa.</hi> 66.18, 19, 20, 21, 22. and other places innumerable; so it was actually erected by Jesus Christ, as we have declared. And whereas it is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and established in the place and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106207:10"/>
room of the <hi>Church-state</hi> under the Old Testament, which was to be removed at <hi>the time of Reformation,</hi> as the Apostle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates at large in his <hi>Epistle to the Hebrews</hi>; all the commands, promises, and threatnings given or annexed unto that <hi>Church-state,</hi> concerning the conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of men unto it, and walking in it, are transferred unto this of the new <hi>erection</hi> of Christ. Wherefore although the State of the <hi>Church</hi> it self, be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from that which was <hi>Nationally Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational,</hi> unto that which is <hi>simply and absolutely</hi> so; and all Ordinances of its instituted worship are changed, with new rules for the observation of what we are directed unto by the light of N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ture: yet the commands, promises, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, made and given unto it <hi>as a Church,</hi> are all in full force with respect unto this <hi>new Church-state</hi>; and we need no new commands to render it our duty to joyn in <hi>Evangelical Churches,</hi> for the ends of a <hi>Church</hi> in general.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THE Lord Christ hath <hi>disposed all the ways and means of edification,</hi> unto these <hi>Churches</hi>; so that ordinarily, and under an expectation of his presence in them, and concurrence unto their efficacy, they are not otherwise to be enjoyed. Such are the ordinary <hi>dispensation of the Word,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:106207:10"/>
and <hi>Administration of the Sacraments.</hi> For any Disciple of Christ to live in a neglect of these things, and the enjoyment of them according to his mind, is to despise his care and wisdom, in providing for his eternal welfare.</p>
            <p n="6">6. HE hath <hi>prescribed sundry duties</hi> unto us, both as necessary, and as evidences of our being his Disciples, such as cannot be orderly performed, but as we are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of some particular Congregation: this also hath been before declared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. THE <hi>Institution of these Churches,</hi> is the way which Christ hath ordained to render his Kingdom visible or conspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in distinction from, and opposition unto, the Kingdom of Satan and the world. And he doth not in a due man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, declare himself <hi>a subject</hi> in or unto the Kingdom of Christ, who doth not solemnly ingage in this way. It is not enough to constitute a <hi>legal subject of the Kingdom of England,</hi> that he is born in the Nation, and lives in some outward observance of the Laws of it, if he refuse solemnly to express his <hi>Allegiance</hi> in the way appointed by the Law for that end. Nor will it constitute a regular subject of the Kingdom of Christ, that he is born in a place where the Gospel is professed, and so professeth a general complyance
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106207:11"/>
therewith; if he refuse to testifie <hi>his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</hi> by the way that Christ hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for that end. It is true, the whole Nation in their civil relation and subordination according to Law, is the <hi>Kingdom of England.</hi> But the representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kingly power and rule in it, is in the Courts of all sorts, wherein the Kingly power is acted, openly and visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. And he that lives in the Nation, yet denies his <hi>h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mage</hi> unto these Courts, is not to be esteemed a Subject. So doth the whole visible professing Church, in one or more Nations, or lesser precincts of people and places constitute the <hi>visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Kingdom of Christ; yet is no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular person to be esteemed a <hi>legal</hi> true Subject of Christ, that doth not <hi>appear in these his Courts</hi> with a Solemn expression of his Homage unto him.</p>
            <p n="8">8. THE whole <hi>Administration of the Rule and Discipline</hi> appointed by Christ, is confined unto these <hi>Churches</hi>; nor can they be approved by whom that rule is despised. I shall not argue farther, in a case whose truth is of so uncontroulable evidence. In all the writings of the New Testament, recording things after the Ascension of Christ, there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any of his Disciples with appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, unless they were extraordinary
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106207:11"/>
Officers, but such as were entire Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of these Assemblies.</p>

For to suppose such a confession of Christian Religion to be compliant with the Gospel, which is made by many who openly <hi>live in Sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> being <hi>disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate,</hi> is to renounce the Gospel it self, Christ is not the High Priest of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106207:16"/>
such a <hi>Profession.</hi> I shall therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare briefly what is necessary unto this <hi>Profession,</hi> that all may know what it is which is required unto the entrance of any into our Churches, wherein our <hi>Practice</hi> hath been sufficiently traduced.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THERE is required unto it a <hi>compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent knowledge</hi> of Doctrines and Mystery of the Gospel, especially concerning the <hi>Person and Offices of Christ.</hi> The Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hereof, was the ground whereon he granted the <hi>Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> or all Church Power unto Believers, <hi>Matth,</hi> 16.17, 18, 19. The first Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which he gave unto his Apostles, was, That they should <hi>teach men</hi> by the preaching of the Gospel, in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth revealed by him. The knowledge required in the Members of the <hi>Judaical Church,</hi> that they might be translated into the <hi>Christian,</hi> was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, if not solely, that of his <hi>Person,</hi> and the acknowledgment of him to be the true <hi>Messiah,</hi> the Son of God. For as on their unbelief thereof their Eternal ruine did depend, as he told them, <hi>if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sins</hi>; so the confession of him was sufficient on their part unto their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission into the Gospel Church State. And the Reasons of it are apparent.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106207:17"/>
With others, an Instruction in all the Mysteries of Religion, especially in those that are <hi>fundamental,</hi> is necessary unto the Profession we enquire after. So <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin Martyr</hi> tells us what pains they took in those Primitive Times, to instruct those in the Mysteries of Religion, who upon a <hi>general Conviction of its Truth,</hi> were willing to adhere unto the Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. And what was their Judgment herein, is sufficiently known, from the keeping a multitude in the state of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecumens,</hi> before they would admit them into the Fellowship of the Church. They are not therefore to be blamed, they do but discharge their Duty, who refuse to receive into Church Communion such as are <hi>ignorant</hi> of the fundamental Doctrines and Mysteries of the Gospel; or if they have learned any thing of them from a form of words, yet really <hi>understand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> of them. The promiscuous driving of all sorts of persons who have been baptized in their Infancy, unto a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of all Church privileges, is a <hi>profanation</hi> of the holy Institutions of Christ. This knowledge therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing unto profession is it self to be professed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THERE is required unto it <hi>a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed subjection of Soul and Conscience unto
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106207:17"/>
the Authority of Christ in the Church, Matth.</hi> 28.18, 19, 20. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. This in general is performed by all that are <hi>Baptized</hi> when they are <hi>Adult,</hi> as being by their own actual consent <hi>baptized in the Name of Christ.</hi> And it is required of all them who are baptized in their Infancy, when they are able with Faith and Understanding to profess their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o, and abiding in that Covenant whereinto they were initiated.</p>
            <p n="3">3. An Instruction in, and consent unto the <hi>Doctrine of Self-denial and bearing of the Cross,</hi>
               <note rend="inter">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.37, 38, 39. <hi>Mar.</hi> 8.34.38. <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.23. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.10, 11, 20. <hi>Act.</hi> 24.14.</note> in a particular manner: For this is made indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensably necessary by our Saviour himself, unto all that will be his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. And it hath been a great disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage unto the Glory of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that men have not been more and better instructed therein. It is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought, that who ever will, may be a Christian at an <hi>easie rate,</hi> it will cost him nothing. But the Gospel gives us another account of these things. For it not only warns us, that Reproaches, Hatred, Sufferings of all sorts, oft-times to Death it self, are the common lot of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106207:18"/>
all its Professors, <hi>who will live godly in Christ Jesus</hi>; but also requires, that at our initiation into the Profession of it, we consider aright the dread of them all, and engage cheerfully to undergo them. Hence, in the <hi>Primitive Times,</hi> whilst all sorts of miseries were continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, presented unto them who embraced the Christian Religion, their willing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to undergo them, who were converted, was a firm evidence of the sincerity of their Faith, as it ought to be unto us also in times of Difficulty and Persecution. Some may suppose that the Faith and Confession of this Doctrine of <hi>Self-denial</hi> and <hi>readiness for the Cross,</hi> is of use only in time of <hi>Persecution,</hi> and so doth not belong unto them who have continually the countenance and favour of publick Authority. I say, it is, at least as they judge, well for them; with others it is not so, whose outward state makes the publick avowing of this Duty indispensably necessary unto them: And I may add it as my own thoughts, (though they are not my own alone) That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the Countenance that is given unto any Church by the <hi>publick Magistracy,</hi> yet whilst we are in this World, those who will faithfully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their Duty, as Ministers of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106207:18"/>
Gospel especially, shall have need to be prepared for sufferings. To escape suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and enjoy worldly advantages by sinful compliances, or bearing with men in their Sins, is no Gospel Direction.</p>
            <p n="4">4, <hi>Conviction and Confession of Sin, with the way of deliverance by Jesus Christ, is that answer of a good Conscience,</hi> that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the Baptism of them that are Adult. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Unto this Profession is required the <hi>constant perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of all known Duties</hi> of Religion,<note rend="inter">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20.</note> both of <hi>Piety</hi> in the publick and private Worship of God, as also of <hi>Charity</hi> with respect unto others. <hi>Shew me thy Faith by thy Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. A careful <hi>Abstinence from all known Sins,</hi> giving scandal or offence, either unto the World, or unto the Church of God. And the Gospel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,<note rend="inter">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.32. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.10.</note> that this Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be made (<hi>with the Mouth Confession is made unto Salvation</hi>) against (1.) <hi>Fear,</hi> (2.) <hi>Shame,</hi> (3.) The <hi>Course of the World,</hi> (4.) The <hi>Opposition</hi> of all Enemies what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>Hence it appears, that there are none excluded from an Entrance into the Church State, but such as are either,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106207:19"/>
(1.) <hi>grosly Ignorant,</hi> or, (2.) <hi>Persecutors,</hi> or reproachers of those that are good, or of the ways of God wherein they walk; or, (3.) <hi>Idolaters</hi>; or, (4.) Men <hi>scandalous in their Lives</hi> in the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sins, or Omission of Duties, thro' vitious Habits or Inclinations; or, (5.) such as would partake of Gospel Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges and Ordinances, yet openly avow that they <hi>will not submit unto the Law and Commands of Christ in the Gospel,</hi> concerning whom, and the like, the Scripture Rule is peremptory; <hi>From such turn away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And herein we are remote from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the example and care of the Primitive Churches. Yea, there are but few, if any, that arrive unto it. Their endeavour was to Preach unto all they could, and rejoiced in the <hi>multitudes that came to hear the Word.</hi> But if any did essay to join themselves unto the Church, their diligence in their Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Instruction, their severe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries into their Conversation, their disposing of them for a long time into a state of <hi>Expectation</hi> for their Trial, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Admittance, were remarkable. And some of the Ancients complain, that their <hi>promiscuous Admittance</hi> of all sorts of persons that would profess the

Christian Religion, into Church Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, which took place af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The things ascribed unto those who are to be esteemed the proper <hi>Subject Matter of a Visible Church,</hi> are such as in the <hi>judgment of Charity</hi> entitles them unto all the Appellations of <hi>Saints, Called, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> that is <hi>Visibly</hi> and by <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THE Controversie about <hi>the Continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Church-state,</hi> and the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of Gospel Ordinances of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, is not new, in this Age, though some pride the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But to reduce things into the lesser com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass; I shall first confirm the Truth by those Arguments or Considerations, which will defeat all the Pleas and Pretences of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106207:21"/>
them, by whom it is opposed; and then confirm it by positive Testimonies and Arguments, with all Brevity possible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> therefore I shall argue from the removal of all causes, whereon such a <hi>Cess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tion of Churches and Ordinances</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. For it is granted on all hands, that they had a Divine Original and Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and were observed by all the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of <hi>Christ,</hi> as thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by him comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. If now therefore they cease as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their force, efficacy and use, it must be on some of these Reasons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because <hi>a limited Time and Season was fixed upon them,</hi> which is now expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. So was it with the <hi>Church-state</hi> and Ordinances of old; they were appointed <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nto the time of Reformation,</hi> Heb. 9.10 They had a certain time prefixed unto their duration, according to the Degrees of whose approach <hi>they waxed old,</hi> and at length utterly disappeared, <hi>chap.</hi> 8.13. until that time they were all punctually to be observed, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.4. But there were many antecedent Indications of the Will of God concerning their Cessation and Abolition, whereof the Apostle disputes at large in his Epistle unto the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> And from a pretended supposition, that such was the state of <hi>Evangelical Ordinances,</hi> namely, that they had a time prefixed unto their
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106207:21"/>
Duration, did the first opposition against them arise. For <hi>Montanus,</hi> with his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, imagined that the appointments of Christ and his Apostles in the Gospel, were to continue in force only unto the coming of the <hi>Paraclete,</hi> or the Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, promised by him. And adding a new <hi>Phrensie</hi> hereunto, that that <hi>Paraclete</hi> was then first come in <hi>Montanus,</hi> they rejected the Institutions of the Gospel, and made new Laws &amp; Rules for themselves. And this continues to be the principal pretence of them by whome the use of Gospel-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances is at present rejected, as that which is of no force or efficacy. Either <hi>they have received,</hi> or do speedily look for such a Dispensation of the Spirit, or his Gifts, as wherein they are to cease and disappear. But nothing can be more vain than this pretence.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is so as unto <hi>the limitation of any Time,</hi> as unto their Duration and Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance. For (1.) There is no Intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on given of any such thing, either in the Divine-Word, Promise, Declaration about them, or the Nature of the Institutions themselves. But whereas those of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> were <hi>in Time</hi> to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the Church might not be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby, seeing Originally they were all of immediate Divine Institution, God
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106207:22"/>
did by all manner of ways, as by Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, express Declarations, and by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Institutio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s themselves, <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signifie their removal,</hi> as the Apostle proves at large in his Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> But nothing of this Nature can be pretended concerning the Gospel <hi>Church state</hi> or Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. (2.) There is no <hi>Prediction</hi> or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of any other way of VVorship, or serving God in this VVorld, that should be introduced in the room of that esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished at first; so that upon a Cessa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion thereof, the <hi>Church</hi> must be left unto all uncertainties and utter ruin. (3.) The principal Reason why a <hi>Church-state</hi> was erected of old, and Ordinances of VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship appointed therein, that were all to be removed and taken away, was, that <hi>the Son, the Lord over his own House,</hi> might have the Preheminence in all things. His Glory it was to put an end unto the Law, as given by the <hi>Disposition of Angels,</hi> and the Ministry of <hi>Moses,</hi> by the Institution of a <hi>Church-state</hi> and Ordinances of his own appointment. And if his Revelation of the Will of God therein be not compleat, perfect, ultimate, unalterable, if it be to expire, it must be, that Honour may be given <hi>above him, unto one greater than he.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is so, as unth their <hi>Decay, or the loss of their primitive Force and Efficacy.</hi> For
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106207:22"/>
their Efficacy unto their proper Ends, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on, (1.) <hi>The I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ution</hi> of Christ: This is the Foundation of all Spiritual Efficacy unto Edification in the <hi>Church,</hi> or whatever belongs thereunto. And therefore whatever <hi>Church-state</hi> may be framed, or Duties, ways or means of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship appointed by Men, that have not his Institution, how specious soever they may appear to be, have no Spiritual Force or Efficacy, as unto the Edification of the <hi>Church,</hi> But whilst this <hi>Institution</hi> of Christ continues irrevocable, and is not <hi>Abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> by a greater Power than what it was enacted by, whatever defect there may be as unto Faith and Obedience in Men, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring them useless and ineffectual unto themselves; however they may be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by additions unto them, or detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from them, changing their Nature and Use; in themselves they continue to be of the same <hi>Vse and Efficacy</hi> as they were at the beginning. (3.) On the <hi>Promise of Christ,</hi> that he will be present with his Disciples in the Observation of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands unto the Consumation of all things, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.20. To deny the continued ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of this Promise, and that on any pretence whatever, is the Venom of Infidelity. If therefore they have an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocable Divine Institution; if <hi>Christ</hi> be
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106207:23"/>
present in their Administrations, as he was of old, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.1. there can be no abatement of their Efficacy unto their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ends, in the Nature of Instrumental Causes.

               </gap>seperable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction between the Word, or the Church and its Institution by the Word, and the Spirit, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59.21. God's <hi>Covenant</hi> with his People is the Foundation of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Church-state,</hi> of all Offices, Powers, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and Duties there unto belonging.

They are the Way, means, and Instruments appointed of God for this end, and other end they have none. And hereon it follows, that if it be not in the power of Men, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point any thing that shall be <hi>a means of Communication</hi> between God and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as unto the Grace of the Covenant, on the one Hand, or the Duties of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which it requires, on the other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; they have no power to erect any new <hi>Church-state,</hi> or enact any thing in Divine Worship, not of his Institution. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the state of Churches and their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, they cannot be altered, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be liable unto any decay, unless the <hi>Covenant</hi> whereunto they are annexed, be altered or decayed. And therefore the Apostle to put finally and absolutely his Argument unto an Issue, to prove that the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Church-State and Ordinances were changed, because useless and ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, doth it on this ground, that the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> whereunto they were annexed, was changed and become useless. This I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose at present will not said concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> whereunto all Ordinances of Divine Worship are insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably annexed.</p>
            <p>Men might at a cheaper Rate, as unto the Eternal interest of their own Souls, provide another Covering for their sloth, negligence, unbelief, and indulgence unto proud foolish imaginations, whereby they render the Churches and Ordinances of the Gospel useless and ineffectual unto themselves; thereby charging them with a decay and uselesness, and so refl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cting on the honour and faithfulness of Christ himself.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THEY do not cease, because there is at present, or at least there is shortly to be expected, <hi>such an effusion of the Gifts and Graces of the Spirit, as to render all these
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:106207:24"/>
external Institutions needless, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly useless.</hi> This also is falsely pretended. For (1.) The greatest and most plentiful effusion of the Holy Spirit in his Gifts and Graces, was in the days of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and of the first <hi>Churches</hi> planted by them; nor is any thing beyond it, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed equal unto it, any more to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in this World. But yet then was the <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>spel Church-state</hi> erected, and the use of all its Ordinances of Worship en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned. (2.) The <hi>Ministry of the Gospel</hi> which comprizeth all the Ordinances of Church worship, as its object and end, is the <hi>Ministration of the Spirit,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no supplies or Communication of him can render it useleless. (3.) One of the <hi>principal ends</hi> for which the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the Spirit is promised unto the <hi>Church,</hi> is to make and render all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of Christ effectual unto its edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. (4.) 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.20, 27. is usually pleaded as giving countenance unto this fond pretence. But (1.) The <hi>Vnction</hi> mentioned by the Apostle, was then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Believers. Yet (2.)

            <p>If all these, or any of them do fail, I acknowledge that all <hi>Ministerial Authority</hi> and Ability, for the dispensation of Gospel-Ordinances must fail also, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the state of the <hi>Church.</hi> And those who plead for the continuation of a successive Ministry, without respect unto these things, without resolving both the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Office of it unto them, do but erect a <hi>dead Image,</hi> or embrace a dead carcase, instead of the living and life giving Institutions of Christ. They take away the living Creature, and set up a <hi>skin stuffed with straw.</hi> But if these things do unalterably continue; if the Law of Christ can neither be changed, abrogated, or disannulled, if his dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of Spiritual gifts according unto his promise cannot be impeded; if Believers

               </gap>mmands of

Christ, nor enjoy the priviledges which he hath annexed unto his Church and Worship. (3.) On this supposition, all <hi>Reformation</hi> of an Apostarized <hi>Church,</hi> is utterly impossible. But it is our duty to heal even <hi>Babylon</hi> it self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by a reduction of all things unto their first Institution, if it would be healed, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 51.9. and if not, we are to forsake her, and reform our selves, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4.</p>
            <p>There is nothing therefore in all these pretences, that should in the least impeach the <hi>infallible continuation</hi> of the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Churches</hi> and Worship, as to their right, unto the end of the world. And the Heads of those Arguments whereby the Truth is invincibly confirmed, may be briefly touched on.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are express Testimonies of the Will of Christ, and his promise for its accomplishment, that the <hi>Church</hi> and all its <hi>Ordinances</hi> of Worship should <hi>be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed always unto the end of the world.</hi> So as to the <hi>Church</hi> it self, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.3. The <hi>Ministry, Matth.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Baptism, Matth.</hi> 28.18, 19, 20. The <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. As for other Institutions, Publick Prayer, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word, the Lords day, singing of Gods Praises, the exercise of Discipline with what belongs thereunto, they have
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:106207:26"/>
their foundation in <hi>the Law and Light of Nature,</hi> being only direct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d and applied unto the Gospel-Church-state and worship, by Rules of especial Institution, and they can no more cease, than the original Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of that Law can so do.</p>
            <p>If it be said, that notwithstanding what may be thus pleaded, yet <hi>de facto,</hi> the true state of Gospel-Churches, and their whole worship as unto its Original Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution did fail under the <hi>Papal Apostacy,</hi> and therefore may do so again: I Answer, (1.) We do not plead that this state of things must be always <hi>visible</hi> and conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, wherein all <hi>Protestant Writers</hi> do agree. It is acknowledged, that as unto publick view, Observation and Notorie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, all these things were lost under the Papacy, and may be so again under a renewed Apostacy. (2.) I do not plead it to be necessary <hi>de facto,</hi> that there should be really at all times, a true visible Church as the seat of all Ordinances and Administrations in the world; but all such Churches may fail, not only as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Visibility, but as unto their Existence. But this supposition of a failure of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi> I grant on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with these Limitations. (1.) That it is of Necessity from innumerable Divine Promises, and the nature of Christ's
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106207:27"/>
Kingly office<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there be always in the world a <hi>number greater or lesser of sincere Believers,</hi> that openly profess subjection and obedience unto him. (2.) That in these Persons there resides <hi>an indefeazable Right</hi> always to gather themselves into a Church state, and to administer all Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ordinances, which all the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deprive them of; which is the whole of what I now plead for. And let it be observed, that all the ensuing Arguments depend on this <hi>Right,</hi> and not on any <hi>Matter of Fact.</hi> (3.) I do not know how far God may accept of Churches in <hi>a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry corrupt state,</hi> and of worship much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> until they have new means for their Reformation. Nor will I make any judgment of Persons as unto their <hi>eternal Condition,</hi> who walk in Churches so cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and in the performance of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship so depraved. But as unto them who know them to be so corrupted and depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, it is <hi>a damnable sin</hi> to joyn with them, or not to separate from them, <hi>Revel.</hi> 18.4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Nature and Use of the Gospel <hi>Church-state</hi> require and prove the <hi>unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted continuance</hi> of the Right of its Existence, and the observance of all <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi> of Divine Worship therein, with a Power in them, in whom that Right
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106207:27"/>
doth indefeazably reside, that is, all true Believers, to bring it forth into exercise and practice notwithstanding the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Impediments which in some places at some times may interrupt its exercise. In the observation of Christ's Institutions, and Celebration of the ordinances of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship, doth the Church-state of the Gospel, as professing, consist. It doth so in opposition. (1.) Unto the <hi>World</hi> and the Kingdom of Satan. For hereby do men <hi>call Jesus Lord,</hi> as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3 and avow their subjection unto his Kingly Power, (2.) Unto <hi>the Church-state of the Old Testament,</hi> as the Apostle disputes at large in his Epistle unto the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> And this state of the professing <hi>Church</hi> in this World is unalterable, because it is the <hi>best state</hi> that the Believing Church is capable of. For so the Apostle plainly proves, that hereby the believing <hi>Church</hi> is brought <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="3">3. <hi>The visible Administration of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ</hi> in this World, consists in this Church-state, with the Administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Institutions and Laws therein.

The Truth of all God's Promises in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture depends on this one Assertion. We need not here concern our selves what Notions some men have about the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of this Kingdom in the world, with respect unto the outward affairs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of it. Rut this is certain, that this Kingdom of Christ in the world, so far as it is external and visible, consists in the <hi>Laws</hi> he hath given, the <hi>Institutions</hi> he hath appointed, the <hi>Rule</hi> or <hi>Politie</hi> he hath prescribed, with the <hi>due observance</hi> of them, Now all these things do make, constitute, and are the Church-state and Worship enquired after. Wherefore as Christ alway h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

avowed Subjection unto the Laws of his word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. And although this Kingdom, or his Kingdom in this sence, may as unto the <hi>essence</hi> of it be preserved in the external Profession of individual persons, and it may be, so exist in the world for a season; yet the honour of it, and its compleat establishment, consists in the <hi>visible profession of Churches,</hi> which he will therefore maintain unto the end. But by <hi>Visible</hi> in this Discourse, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not that which is conspicuous and eminent unto all, though the Church hath been so, and shall yet be so again; nor yet that which is actually seen or known by others; but only that which may be so, or is capable of being so known.

               </gap>; And to joyn with such a Church, would (1.) Stain their Profession, (2.) Hinder their Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; (3.) Establish a new Rule of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion unknown to the Scriptures; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, besides Truth; as might easily be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Where the <hi>Fundamentals of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Worship,</hi> are corrupted or overthrown, it is absolutely unlawful to joyn unto, or abide in any Church. So is it with the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome. The various ways where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Foundations of Divine Religious Worship, are overthrown in that Church by Superstition and Idolatry, have been sufficiently declared. These render the Communion of that Church pernitious.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Nor can any Man be obliged to joyn himself with any Church, nor can it be his Duty so to do, where the Eternally fixed Rule and Measure of Religious Worship, namely, that it be of Divine Institution, is varied or change <hi>by any Additions unto</hi> it, or <hi>Substractions</hi> from it. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as one principal end of all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:106207:31"/>
Man can be obliged unto Communion therewith.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Where the <hi>Fundamentals of Church Order,</hi> Practice and Discipline are destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is not lawful for any man to joyn in Church Communion. These Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntals are of two sorts; (1.) Such as concern the <hi>Ministry of the Church</hi>; (2.) Such as concern <hi>the</hi> Church <hi>it self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are four things that are <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Fundamentals</hi> unto the Order of the Church, on the part of the <hi>Ministry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That all the Ministers or Officers of it, be <hi>duly chosen</hi> by the Church it self, and solemnly set apart in the Church unto their Office, according unto the Rule and Law of Christ. This is Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental unto Church Order, the Root of it, from whence all other parts of it do Spring. And it is that which is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or expresly provided for in the Scripture, as we shall see. If there be a neglect herein, and no other Relation required between <hi>Ministers, Elders, Rulers, Bishops,</hi> and the Church, but what is raised and created by Ways and Rules of mens ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, or if there be a Temporary disposal of Persons into a discharge of that <hi>Office,</hi> without a solemn Call, Choice, Ordination, and Separation unto the Office it self and its work, the Law of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:106207:32"/>
Christ is violated, and the Order of the Church disturbed in its Foundation.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That those who are called unto the Office of the Ministry be <hi>duly qualified,</hi> by their Endowment with Spiritual Gifts for the discharge of their <hi>Duty,</hi> is Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental unto the Ministry; that the Lord Jesus Christ doth still continue his Dispensation of Spiritual Gifts unto Men, to fit and enable them unto the Office and work of the Ministry; that if he doth not do so, or should at any time cease so to do, the whole Office of the Ministry must cease, and the Being of the Church with it, that it is altogether use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less for any Churches or Persons to erect an Image of the Gospel Ministry by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Rites and Ceremonies, without the enlivening form of these Spiritual Gifts, I have proved sufficiently in my Discourse <hi>of Spiritual Gifts and their c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ntinuance in the Church.</hi> Wherefore a Communication of Spiritual Gifts peculiarly enabling Men unto the Work of the Ministry, antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent unto their solemn Separation unto the Office, in some good Measure, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary unto the due continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Office and its Work; See <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. To sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that the Lord Christ doth call and appoint Men, unto a certain Office and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106207:32"/>
Work in his Church, secluding all others from any Interest in the one or other, and yet not endow them with peculiar <hi>Gifts and Abilities</hi> for the discharge of that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d Work, is to ascribe that unto him, which is every way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unbecoming his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Grace, with his Love unto the Church. But when Men look on all Church Order, as a <hi>lifeless Machine</hi> to be acted moved and disposed by External Rules, Laws, Canons and Orders, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out respect unto the Actings of the Spirit of Christ going before in the Rule of his Word, to enliven every part of it, the true Disciples of Christ will receive no advantage thereby.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) It is of the same Importance that Persons so called <hi>do take heed unto their Ministry that they fulfil it,</hi> that they give themselves unto the VVord and Prayer, that they labour continually in the VVord and Doctrine, and all those other Duties which in the Scripture are prescribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; and this not only as unto the Matter of them, but as unto the Manner of their performance with Zeal, Love, Compassion and Diligence. Where there is a <hi>great Defect</hi> in any of these things, on what Pretence soever it be; where Men esteem themselves exempted from this Work, or not obliged unto it; when
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106207:33"/>
they suppose that they may discharge their Office at a cheaper rate, and with less trouble, as unto their present Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, by such ways as I shall not here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, No Man is, no Man can be obliged to <hi>confine</hi> his Church Communion, unto such a Ministry.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) It is required that they be <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> unto the Flock, in the Expression of the Nature and Power of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which they Preach, in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, especially in Zeal, Humility, Self-denial, and readiness for the Cross.</p>
            <p>Where these things are not, there is such a defect in the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of Church Practice, us unto the <hi>Ministry</hi> of it, that no Man who takes care of his own Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, can joyn himself unto a Church, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring under it. For Ministers and Churches are nothing but instituted means of the Conversion of Sinners, and the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Believers. And when any of them through their own default cease so to be, there is no obligation unto any man to joyn or continue in their Communion; nor do they contract any Guilt in a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able departure from them, but discharge their Duty. That this be done <hi>peaceably</hi> without strife or contention, without judging of others, as unto their Interest in Christ, and Eternal Salvation, the Law
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:106207:33"/>
of Moral Obedience doth require. That it be done with Love and Compassion and Prayer towards, and for them who are left, is the peculiar Direction of that moral Duty by the Gospel. Such a Practice at present would fall under severe charges and accusations, as also brutish Penalties in some places. But when all <hi>Church Craft</hi> shall be defeated, and the uses that are made of its imaginary Authority be discarded, there will be little occasion of this Practise, and none at all of Offence.</p>
            <p>Again; There are Things <hi>Fundamental</hi> unto Church Practise and Order in the <hi>Church it self,</hi> which where they are neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, no man ought of choice to joyn himself unto that Church, seeing he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it without the Prejudice of his Edification, the furtherance whereof he ought to design in that Duty. And these are,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That the <hi>Discipline of Christ</hi> be duly exercised in it, according unto his mind, and by the Rules of his Prescripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There never was any Sect, Order, or Society of men in the world, designed for the Preservation and Promotion of Vertue and things Praise-worthy, but they had <hi>Rules of Discipline</hi> proper unto the Ends of their Design, to be observed in and by all that belong unto them. VVhere
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:106207:34"/>
the Erection of such Societies is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the VVorld, as it is much in the <hi>Papacy,</hi> both their Constitution, and their Conversation, depend on the <hi>especial Rules of Discipline</hi> which they have framed unto themselves. And this is done by them in great Variety; for being ignorant of the <hi>Discipline of the Gospel,</hi> and so esteeming it insufficient unto their Design, they have made no end of <hi>Coyning Rules</hi> unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. To suppose that our Lord Jesus Christ, who in this <hi>Church-state</hi> according unto his infinite VVisdom, hath erected the most perfect Society for the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Ends, of Religion, of Obedience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, of Love and Usefulness among our selves, hath not appointed a <hi>Discipline,</hi> and <hi>given Rules</hi> concerning its Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the Preservation of that Society, and the attaining of those Ends, is highly injurous unto his Honour and Glory.</p>
            <p>VVhere therefore there is a <hi>Church</hi> or any Society that pretends so to be, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is an <hi>utter Neglect of this Discipline of Christ,</hi> or the establishment of another, not administred by the Laws and Rules that he prescribed, no Disciple of Christ can be obliged to joyn unto, or to continue in the Total sole <hi>Communion</hi> of such a Church. And whereas there are two Parts of this <hi>Discipline of Christ</hi>; That
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:106207:34"/>
which is <hi>Private,</hi> among the Members of the Church, for the Exercise and Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Love; and that which is <hi>Publick,</hi> in and by the Authority of the Rulers of the Church, for the Preservation of Purity and Order, a Neglect in either of them, doth much impeach the Fundamental <hi>Constitution</hi> of a Church as unto its Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are sundry other things which belong unto this <hi>Discipline</hi> in General, which are of great considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Discharge of the Duty we enquire into. Among them are,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That constant <hi>Difference</hi> be put between the Good and the Bad in all <hi>Church</hi> Administrations;</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That Persons <hi>openly or fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gitiously</hi> wicked, be not admitted into the Society of the Church, or a participation of its Priviledges.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) That <hi>Holiness,</hi> Love, and Useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, be openly avowed as the Design and interest of the Church. But they are all so comprized in the General Head of <hi>Discipline,</hi> as that I shall not in particular insist upon them.</p>
            <p>From what hath been thus declared, it will appear on the other hand, <hi>what Church</hi> it is that a <hi>Disciple of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who takes due care of his own Edification and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:106207:35"/>
Salvation,</hi> ought in duty to joyn himself unto in compleat Communion. To an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er this Enquiry, is the end of all those Discourses and Controversies which have been about the <hi>Notes of the true Church.</hi> I shall briefly determine concerning it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Principles before Evinc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d.</p>
            <p n="1">1. IT must be such a Church as wherein all the <hi>Fundamental Truths</hi> of the Gospel are believed, owned, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, without Controversie, and those not born withal by whom they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied or opposed. Without this a Church is not <hi>the Ground and Pillar of Truth,</hi> it doth not hold the Head, it is not built on the foundation of the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. Neither is it sufficient, that those things are generally professed or not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied. A Church that is filled with wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and contentions about <hi>fundamental or important Truths</hi> of the Gospel, is not of choice to be joyned unto. For these things subvert the Souls of Men, and greatly impede their Edification. And although both among distinct Churches, and among the Members of the same Church, <hi>mutual Forbearance</hi> be to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised, with respect unto a variety in Apprehensions in some Doctrines of lesser Moment; Yet the Incursion that hath been made into sundry Protestant Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:106207:35"/>
in the last and present Age, of Novel Doctrines and Opinions, with Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Divisions, and endless Disputes which have ensued thereon, have rendered it very difficult to determine, how to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in <hi>compleat Communion</hi> with them. For I do not judge, that any man is, or can be obliged unto constant total Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with any Church, or to give up himself absolutely unto the conduct there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, wherein there are incurable dissensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about important Doctrines of the Gospel. And if any Church, shall pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly avow, countenance, or approve of Doctrines contrary unto those which were the Foundation of its first Communion, the Members of it are at Liberty, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain the Communion of it, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide otherwise for their own Edification.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IT must be such a Church as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Divine Worship Instituted</hi> or appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Christ himself, is diligently obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, without any Addition made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. In the Observation of this Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship as unto all external, occasional Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies and Circumstances of the Acts wherein it doth consist, it is left unto the Prudence of the Church it self, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Light of Nature, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rules of Scripture; and it must be so unless we shall suppose that the Lord
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:106207:36"/>
Jesus Christ, by making men his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, doth unmake them from being ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Crea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ures, or refuseth the Exercise of the rational Faculties of our Souls in his service. But this is so remote from Truth, that on the contrary, he gives them an improvement for this very end, that we may know how to deport our selves aright in the Observance of his Commands, as unto the outward discharge of them in his Worship and the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of it. And this he doth by that Gift of <hi>Spiritual Wisdom,</hi> whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eof we shall treat afterwards.</p>
            <p>But if Men, if Churches, will make <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> in or unto the Rites of religious Worship, unto what is appointed by Christ himself, and require their Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance in their Communion, on the force and efficacy of their being so by them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, no Disciple of Christ is or can be obliged, by vertue of any Divine Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution or Command, to joyn in <hi>total, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute</hi> Communion, with any such Church. He may be induced on various conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to judge, that something of that Nature at some season, may not be evil and sinful unto him, which therefore he will bear with, or comply withal; yet he is not, he cannot be obliged by vertue of any Divine Rule or Command, to joyn
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:106207:36"/>
himself with, or continue in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of such a Church. If any shall suppose that hereby <hi>too much Liberty</hi> is granted unto Believers in the choice of their Communion, and shall thereon make severe Declamations, about the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences and Evils, which will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue; I desire they would remember the Principle I proceed upon, which is, that <hi>Churches</hi> are not such <hi>sacred Machines</hi> as some suppose, erected and acted for the outward Interest and Advantages of any sort of men; but only means of the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Believers, which they are bound to make use of, in Obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Commands of Christ,</hi> and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. Whereas therefore the Disciples of Christ, have not only a Divine warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty justifying them in the doing of it, but an express command making it their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensible Duty to joyn in the <hi>Celeb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of all that Religious Worship, which the Lord Christ the only Law giver of the Church, and who was faithful both in and over the House of God, as the Son, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ath Instituted and commanded; but have no such warranty or command for any thing else, it is their Duty to stand fast in the Liberty wherewith Christ hath made them free. And if by the same <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reath, in the <hi>same Rule,</hi> Law or
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:106207:37"/>
Canon, they are commanded and obliged to observe in the Worship of God, what the Lord Christ hath appointed, and what he hath not appointed, both on the same Grounds, namely, the Authority of the Church, and on the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their Omission, no man can be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely obliged to embrace the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any Church on such Terms.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IT is required that <hi>the Ministry of a Church so to be joyned with,</hi> is not defective in any of those things which according to the Rule of the Gospel are <hi>fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> thereunto. What these are, hath been declared. And because <hi>Edification,</hi> which is the end of Church Communion, doth so eminently depend on <hi>the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of the Church,</hi> there is not any thing which we ought to have a more diligent consideration of, in the joyning of our selves unto any such Communion. And where the <hi>Ministry</hi> of any Church, be the Church of what sort or size it will, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curably Ignorant or Negligent, or thro' a defect in Gifts, Grace, or conscientious attendance unto their Duty, is insufficient unto the due Edification of the Souls of them that believe, no man can account himself obliged unto the Communion of the Church, but he that can be satisfied with a <hi>Shadow</hi> and the Names of things,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:106207:37"/>
for the <hi>Substance</hi> and Reality of them.</p>
            <p>If therefore it be granted, as I think it is, that <hi>Edification</hi> is the principal End of all Church Communion, it is not intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible how a Man should be obliged unto that Communion, and that alone, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>due Edification</hi> cannot be obtained. Wherefore, a Ministry <hi>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>abled</hi> by Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Gifts, and <hi>ingaged</hi> by sense of Duty to labour constantly in the use of all means appointed by Christ for the Edification of the Church, or increase of his Mystical Body, is required in such a Church, as a Believer may conscientiously joyn himself unto. And where it is otherwise, let Men cry out <hi>Schism</hi> and <hi>Faction</hi> whilst they please, Jesus Christ will acquit his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, in the Exercise of their Liberty, and accept them in the Discharge of their Duty.</p>
            <p>If it be said, that if all Men be thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to judge of what is <hi>best for their own Edification,</hi> and to act according unto the Judgment which they make, they will be <hi>continually pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>risti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, yet do indeed take it for grant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d, that they <hi>have such a Liberty,</hi> and that it is their Duty to make use of it. For what are all the Contests between the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and the Church of</hi> England, so far as Christians, that are not Church-men, are concerned in them? Is it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot, in whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these Churches <hi>Edification</hi> may be best obtained? If this be not the Ball between us, I know not what is. Now herein do all the Writers and Preachers of both Parties give <hi>their Reasons</hi> and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments unto the People, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y <hi>Edification</hi> is better to be had in the one Church than in the other? And do they not require of them to form a Judgment upon those Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Arguments, and to act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly; if they do not, they do but make a Fourish, and act a Part, like <hi>Players on a stage,</hi> without any determinate design.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) All Christians <hi>actually do so</hi>; they do judge for themselves, unless they are brutish; they do Act according unto that Judgment unless they are hardened in Sin; and therefore who do not so, are not to be esteemed Disciples of Christ. To
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:106207:38"/>
suppose that in all things of Spiritua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and Eternal Concernment, that men are not determined and acted, every one by his own Judgment, is an Imagination of men who think but little of what they are, or do, or say, or write. Even those who shut their Eyes against the Light, and follow in the H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rd, resolving not to enquire into any of these things, do it, because they <hi>judge it is best for them so to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">(4.) It is commonly acknowledged by <hi>Protestants,</hi> that private Christians have a <hi>Judgment of Discretion</hi> in things of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Term was invented to grant them some Liberty of Judgment in Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition unto the blind Obedience required by the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome; but withal to put a <hi>restraint</hi> upon it, and a distinction of some Superiour Judgment, it may be, in the Church or o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hers. But if by <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,</hi> they mean <hi>the best of Mens Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi> Knowledge, Wisdom, and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in and about the things wherein it is exercised, I should be glad to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, what <hi>other Judgment,</hi> than this of <hi>Discretion</hi> in and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bout the things of Religion, this or that or any Church in the World, can have or exercise. But to allow Men a Judgment of Discretion, and not to grant it their Duty to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conding unto that Judgment, is to oblige
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:106207:39"/>
them to be <hi>Fools,</hi> and to act, <hi>not discreetly,</hi> at least not according unto <hi>their own Discretion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The same is to be spoken of <hi>Gospel Discipline,</hi> without which neither can the Duties of Church Societies be observed, nor the ends of them attained. The neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, the loss, the abuse hereof, is that which hath ruined the Glory of Christian Religion in the World, and brought the whole Profession of it into Confusion. Hereon have the servency and sincerity of true <hi>Evangelical</hi> mutual Love been abated, yea, utterly lost. For that Love which Jesus Christ requireth among his Disciples, is such as never was in the World before amongst men, nor can be in the World, but on the Principles of the Gospel, and Faith therein. Therefore it is called his <hi>New Commandement.</hi> The Continuation of it amongst the Generality of Christians is but vainly pretended; little or nothing of the Reality of it in its due Exercise is found. And this hath ensued on the Neglect of <hi>Evangelical Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline</hi> in Churches, or the turning of it into a Worldly Domination. For one principal End of it, is the Preservation, Guidance, and acting of this Love. That <hi>mutual Watch</hi> over one another that ought to be in all the Members of the Church,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:106207:39"/>
the Principal Evidence and Fruit of Love without Dissimulation, is also lost hereby. Most Men are rather ready to say in the Spirit and Words of <hi>Cain, Am I my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Keeper,</hi> than to attend unto the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Apostles. <hi>Exhort one another daily, least any be hardened through the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulness of Sin</hi>; or comply with the Command of our Saviour, <hi>if thy Brother offend thee, tell him of it between him and thee.</hi> By this means likewise is the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Communion lost, and those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived principal Members of Churches, who by all the Rules of <hi>Primitive Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,</hi> ought to be cast out of them. Wherefore this also is to be considered in the Choice we are to make of what Churches we will joyn our selves unto, as unto <hi>constant compleat Communion,</hi> and in whose Communion we will abide. For these things are matters of Choice, and consist in Voluntary free Acts of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. With those unto whom they are not so, who would on the one hand have them to be things that Men may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled unto, and ought so to be; or on the other, that follow no other Guidance in them but outward Circumstances fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
