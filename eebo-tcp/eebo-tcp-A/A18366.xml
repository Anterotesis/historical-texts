            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>ITH my hartie commendations beloued cosen: in performance of my promise (although not so sone as you looked for): I do send vnto you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with by this bearer, some Nitre on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. And as you shall like thereof, I shalbe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to furnish you accordingly. Not doubting that you shall finde it a marchandize as auaillea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; gainfull, as anie drugge of grosse quantitie that you shall haue to do with, so manie waies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious is it, to the vse aswell of the meaner people, as of the delicater sort.</p>
            <p>THis <hi>Nitre</hi> is (as you may perciue) a iuice thickned by growing together, and hardned by congelation, in forme and apparance like vnto transparent Alome, Salgemme, or Borace. And (in deede) such sort of it as is growen together in the earth and hardned into a stonie substance by long abyding so, and at the last is digged vp and brought into Christian regions out of Egypt, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menie, Turkie, Barbarie, and other far countries comming
<pb facs="tcp:17230:4"/>
to the hands of the Borace makers vnpure, and by them refy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is the principall substance and matter, of which they doe make the Borace wherewith the Goldsmythes doe solder their workes of gold and of siluer: And the Battriesmythes their copper pannes. A drugge so rare and precious, as by the great price and small plentie thereof, is knowen vnto you. Neither commeth this <hi>Nitre</hi> (which I doe sende vnto you) o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise to be had in qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>titie for our countrie to haue the vse and commodie thereof, but by my fathers industrie and meanes. And yet his good minde vnto his natiue countrie is such, as to procure it so reasonably cheape, that the poorer sort be not barred the benefit of so necessary and so great a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, for the excessiuenes of the price.</p>
            <p>What I haue heard him define and discourse of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, nature, and excellent facultie, and manyfold vse, of this <hi>Nitre</hi>: (gathered partly of good authours, and partely of his owne experience and of reason) I will empart vnto you, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, so well as my memory hath serued me to note: To your selfe I meane. For if (by your shewing this my letter for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the matter) the learned, or others (in proofe thereof) reprone my report, I must excuse me to haue not so perfectlie borne a waie his speaches thereof, as he deliuered them. Neither did he to other ende impart it vnto me, but for mine owne instruction: knowing how sufficiently the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (vpon the sight and taste of this <hi>Nitre</hi>) can define and set downe what it is, and howe to vse it. And fittest for their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and iudgement, charitablie to publish &amp; recommend the fittest vse and fruition thereof, to the publicke commoditie.</p>
            <p>The smack thereof (being at the first tast vnto the tongue, sowre sharpe, then moderatelie bitter, and lastlie a little rancke in the swallowing) argueth therein a mixture of a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie substance, altred and maistred by coldnes beyond the first degree (formallie rather then effectually) whereon an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne heate hath out breathed whatsoeuer natiue heate was therein: Leauing yet the pricking sharpnes that was in that watrie altered substance, which perceth the tongue, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:17230:4"/>
also mixed an earthie drie substance, ouermaistred and subtiliated by a smoothering heate, (partely beyonde the first degree, causing the rankenes &amp; leuened Nitrositie: and parte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lie adusted by a sterie heate vnto the middle of the seconde degree, causing bitternes:) which bitternes being of more force, effecteth the tast more stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gly the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ranke Nitrositie. So as vntill the smacke of bitternes be passed, the ranknes is not perceiued. By mixture of which passiue substances, earth, and water, the action and leauening of putrefactiue heate, hath caused in that rancke Nitrositie, an oilie and gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie substance aiery. The fattenes and oyllienes whereof, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the aforesaide watrie substance (out of the which the nature heate first hath bene euaporated by an externe heate, and then altred and maistred by coldnes, so surmounteth the drie, adust, earthy, subtile parte therof, as sufficeth it not to fluzze nor enflame, nor be set on fire, (as Saltpeter will) nor to sparke (as salt will) by reason the watrie substance is so maistred with the oylie airie substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, neither is it salt as Saltpeter is. For, as for the the tast of saltnes (which was else also perceiued in that sort of <hi>Nitre</hi> that commeth from Armenie, aswell as also that fine meale or flower of <hi>Nitre</hi> called <hi>Aphro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Nitron</hi>) this <hi>Nitre</hi> hath thereof litle or nothing at all. Bycause (what saltnes it had of if selfe) is separated from it in the refyning. And for the oyllines or fattenes sti<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l abyding with it, vnles it be consumed by further burning artificiall, it hath not yet that purchased saltnes.</p>
            <p>The colour of this <hi>Nitre</hi> is (as you may see) onelie white, by reason of the refineing: And so not of colour blacke, or rus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set, as is the natiue or vnpurified <hi>Nitre</hi> mixed with the sotle of the earth or slimie pittes or slowghes out of the which it is digged or gathered.</p>

Neuertheles this refined <hi>Nitre</hi> (with artificiall burning) shall also purchase more subtility and aduste qualitie.
