         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

cauſe her to imbrace the vnion of diuine loue, and to take for her ſpouſe the King of glory. Now in regard that our Lord had already ſetled ſuch an amity betweene theſe two ſiſters, that their ſeparation was afflictiue &amp; troubleſome vnto them, (though then their deſires &amp; willes were farre different) he made no delay to fauour this his poore ſuppliant, and deuout ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, euen in this her firſt petition, which she ſo inſtantly required of him, and which his diuine maieſty ſo readily graunted.</p>
               <p>Sixteene dayes then after her conuerſion, her ſiſter <hi>Agnes</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired of God, with a ſtrong and prompt reſolution gaue a ſlip, and farewell to the world, &amp; came to her ſiſter <hi>Clare,</hi> to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diſcouering

This noble conuerſion of <hi>Agnes,</hi> by the prayers of her ſiſter <hi>Clare,</hi> was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by as many contradictions of her kindred, as that of S. <hi>Clare:</hi> but theſe bleſſed ſiſters ſeruing our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and imitating his ſtepps, ſhe that had moſt taſt of God, and was in higher progreſſe, inſtructed her ſiſter Nouice. Their kindred knowing that <hi>Agnes</hi> was

The day following then, with an extreme rage and fury they came to thoſe holy virgins, yet at their firſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming diſſembling their lewd intention, they ſhewed them ſome fauorable countenance: then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing themſelues to the virgin <hi>Agnes,</hi> deſpayring of all hope to withdraw S. <hi>Clare</hi> from her holy purpoſe, they demaunded of her, wherfore ſhe was retyred into that place? the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> willed her to deliberate, and reſolue to retourne with them to her Fathers houſe: whereto ſhe anſwered, that ſhe was reſolued, (the grace of God aſſiſting her)

to remayne with her ſiſter: which anſwere one of them diſdayning, full of paſſion, and tranſported with choler, took her by the haire, and gaue her many blowes with his feet and fiſtes; then vſed all his force to pull her out of the place, which at length by the help of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers he performed: for taking her in their armes, they forcibly tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her out.</p>
               <p>But this little daughter of Ieſus Chriſt, ſeing herſelfe violently wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by thoſe furious lyons out the armes of her God, ſhe began to cry to her ſiſter, Help me ſiſter, &amp; permit me not to be ſeparated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and your louing company.

In the meane while S. <hi>Clare,</hi> vnable by other meanes to relieue her ſiſter, had recourſe to prayer, with aboundance of teares, beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching God to vouchſafe to giue a couragious confidence, to her ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, that his diuine fauour defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his faythfull ſeruant, humane forces might be ouercome: and our Lord heard her. For at the inſtant of her prayer, the body of the virgin <hi>Agnes</hi> miraculouſly became ſo weighty, that her kindred were at length inforced to leaue her on the ground: and albeit ſo many men, and their ſeruantes, put all their forces to lift her vp, yet could they neuer doe it, but called labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21895:23"/>
and workemen of the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards that wrought therabouts to aſſiſt them, yet their great number no more auayled then the leſſe.</p>
               <p>Finally the forces fayling of her kindred, and thoſe that attempted to aſſiſt them, they acknowledged the miracle, though ſcornefully, ſaying: it is no maruayle though ſhe be ſo weighty, hauing layne all night as lead. Whereupon <hi>Signor Monaldo</hi> her vncle in extreme paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lifting vp his armes to ſtrike her, he preſently felt an extreme payne therein, which did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly torment him for the preſent, but a long tyme after. Then S. <hi>Clare</hi> after her prayer, ariuing, beſought her kindred to forbeare in vaine to contend with God, and to leaue her the care of her ſiſter,

who lay as halfe dead. They per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing their labour loſt to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their pious reſolution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exceedingly vvearyed, left the two ſiſters togeather.

               <p>AS Saint <hi>Clare</hi> was mortifyed in her fleſh, and farre more from all corporall recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo did ſhe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually buſy her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in deuotions, and diuine prayſes. This virgin had fixed, &amp; imprinted the ſubtility of her fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent deſire in the eternall light, and as ſhe was remote from earthly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations, and rumors, ſo did ſhe the more largely dilate the boſome of her ſoule to the influence of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine grace. She continued in long prayer together with her religious after Complin, the riuers of teares
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:21895:37"/>
that flowed from her eyes awaking and bathing the harts of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions: when the ſleep of others gaue her opportunity to be ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, being often in prayer, she wold lay her face agaynſt the earth ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with teares, kiſſing it ſweetly, and with ſuch contentment, that she ſeemed alwayes to hold in her armes her ſpouſe Ieſus Chriſt, at vvhoſe feete her teares trickled downe, and her kiſſes left their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.</p>
               <p>It hapned one time, that as this holy virgin powred out her teares in the ſilence of the night, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of darknes appeared vnto her in figure of a blacke young man, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, If thou continueſt this extreme weeping thou wilt become blynd, wherto she anſwered, he that is to

It is without doubt, that Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God had coupled, &amp; conioyned his ſweetnes with her pouerty, and did manifeſt exteriorly in her ſoule what was interiourly repleniſhed with diuine light. In this manner did ſhe ordinarily liue full of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme delights, paſſing ouer this deceiptfull world with her noble ſpouſe Ieſus Chriſt, and being pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vpon this wheele of motion, ſhe was theron ſuſteyned with an

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:21895:47"/>
them to haue no affection to their carnall kindred, and intierely to forget their ownehouſe, the better to pleaſe Ieſus Chriſt.

               <p>Finally ſhe would haue them ſo imployed in handy labour for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine houres, that they might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be more prompt, and better prepared to the deſire of their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour by the exerciſe of prayer,

Another ſeruant of God borne at Peruſia had for two years togeather ſo loſt her voice, that one could ſcarſely heare her ſpeak; but hauing vnderſtood by a viſion which ſhe had the night of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of our bleſſed Lady, that S. <hi>Clare</hi> ſhould cure her, the poore afflicted creature hauing very pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently expected the breake of day, repayred with a ſtrong confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence vnto that holy virgin, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:21895:60"/>
by ſignes craued her benediction, which fauour hauing obtained, her voice, which ſo long time ſhe had wanted, became as cleere and ſhrill as euer it had byn.</p>
               <p>Another Religious called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina, that had bin long time deafe in one of her eares, and hauing in vaine tryed many remedies, Saint <hi>Clare</hi> making the ſigne of the croſſe vpon her head, and with her hand touching her care, ſhe recouered her hearing as perfectly and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as before. Another Religious call <hi>Andrea</hi> had a diſeaſe in her throat, the griefe wherof procured her much impatience: it being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, that among ſo many pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers inflamed with diuine loue, their ſhould be a ſoule ſo could, &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſuch prudent virgins one ſo

               <p>This Religious feeling herſelfe one night more tormented with her infirmity then ordinarily, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted &amp; impatient, that her paine did rather increaſe then diminiſh, ſhe ſo cruſhed and preſſed her throat, making thereby appeare her intention to choake herſelfe, thinking by violence to expell that ſwelling, ſo to auoid longer tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; through ignorance at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to do more then was the will of God. But whiles that poore Religious buſied herſelfe in this folly, Saint <hi>Clare</hi> by diuine inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had knowledge thereof, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore calling one of her Religious, ſhe vvilled her to haſten downe, boyle an egge in the ſhell, &amp; cauſe ſiſter <hi>Andrea</hi> to ſwallow it, which
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:21895:61"/>
done to bring her to her preſence. The Religious inſtantly dreſſed the egge, and forth with brought it to the ſicke party, whome ſhe found little better then dead, hauing ſo cruſhed her throat, that her ſpeach was vtterly gone, yet ſhe made her ſwallow the egge ſo well as ſhe could, then rayſing her from her ſtraw bed, ſhe with much labour led her to Saint <hi>Clare,</hi> who thus ſpake vnto her; Wretched ſiſter confeſſe thee to God, &amp; haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, for what thou intendeſt to doe, &amp; acknovvledge that Ieſus Chriſt wil giue thee health far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then thou with thine owne handes hadſt purpoſed to doe: change this euill life into a better, for thou ſhalt neuer recouer ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſicknes that shal ſucceed this,

but ſhalt dye therof. Theſe words procured in this Religious a ſpirit of compunction and contrition, ſo that ſhe being intierly cured of this grieuous infirmity, amended her life, falling a little after into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſicknes, which Saint <hi>Clare</hi> had foretold, wherof ſhe ended her life piouſly.</p>
               <p>It doth manifeſtly appeare by theſe examples, and by many other marueylous thinges, that the tree of the Croſſe of our bleſſed Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt was deeply planted in her hart, &amp; that in a meruailous ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner the fruits therof did interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourly recreate her ſoule, ſith the leaues did worke exteriourly ſuch remedies by the hands &amp; merits of his glorious Saint.</p>

But the vertue of her patience doth eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeare, in that hauing

byn twenty eight yeares togeather afflicted with diuers diſeaſes, ſhe was neuer heard to vtter the leaſt murmure or complaint: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually were heard to proceed out of her mouth pious wordes, and thankes-giuing to Almighty God.</p>
               <p>Now being exceedingly weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with infirmity, and euery mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeeming to her the drawing on of her life towardes an end, it pleaſed our Lord Ieſus Chriſt to prolonge it, till ſhe might be viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the eminent Prelates of the Roman Church, wherof ſhe was a ſeruant, and a ſpeciall child; for the Pope being yet at Lyons, and this Saint beginning to be more tormented with her infirmities, then ſhe was accuſtomed to be, a ſword of ſorrow pierced through
