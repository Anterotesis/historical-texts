            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

with <hi>Ioy</hi> its Enemy. <hi>Thou</hi> wert the most <hi>content,</hi> and the most <hi>afflicted</hi> of all men: <hi>Thou</hi> wert able to cause <hi>Envy</hi> in the <hi>most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, Compassion</hi> in the <hi>most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi> and <hi>Astonishment</hi> in them <hi>both.

to <hi>thine Apostles</hi>; and when the thought of <hi>death</hi> made such havock in thy <hi>Soul, thou</hi> didst <hi>encourage Martyrs</hi> to the <hi>Combat; thou</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parest <hi>Crowns</hi> for their <hi>Victories</hi>; and procuring them <hi>strength</hi> by <hi>thy weaknesses, thou</hi> ordainest them to be the <hi>Champions</hi> of thy <hi>Church Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whatever help they received from <hi>thy Grace,</hi> their <hi>Victories</hi> were never like <hi>thine</hi>; they found more obedience in the World, than in <hi>themselves</hi>; and have confessed, it cost them less to overcome <hi>wild Beasts,</hi> than to vanquish their own <hi>Passions.</hi> Famous <hi>Martyrs</hi> have been known, who having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Lyons,</hi> could not quell their <hi>own choler</hi>; and have suffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be born away with <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience,</hi> after they had endured <hi>Tortures</hi>: Their <hi>Combats</hi> were not

               <hi>always</hi> followed with good <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess</hi>; they were oft-times in one and the same day, both <hi>Conquered</hi> and <hi>Conquerors:</hi> They gave way to <hi>Voluptuousness,</hi> after they had triumphed over <hi>Grief</hi>; and having had courage enough to be <hi>Martyrs,</hi> they wanted resolution to be <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</hi> How often have they wisht for <hi>Death,</hi> that they might be freed from these <hi>domestick</hi> enemies? and to that end, <hi>sighed</hi> and made <hi>vows?</hi> When <hi>thy Providence</hi> gave them over to their own <hi>weakness,</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaired of their <hi>Salvation</hi>; finding no support save in <hi>thy Goodness,</hi> they begun all their wrestlings by <hi>Prayer,</hi> and professed, that to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their <hi>Passions,</hi> they must be animated by <hi>thy Spirit,</hi> and assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>thy Power.

            <p>Indeed, it is <hi>thou</hi> alone who canst <hi>rule</hi> our <hi>passions; thou</hi> art <hi>he only</hi> who workest our <hi>good</hi> out of our <hi>Evil,</hi> and of <hi>Poysons</hi> composest <hi>Antidotes.

him, <hi>thou</hi> makest a <hi>holy use</hi> of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair,</hi> to withdraw from the <hi>World</hi> a <hi>Courtier</hi>; whose youth had been mis-imployed in the service of some Prince; thou makest an admirable <hi>use</hi> of <hi>Disdain,</hi> to extinguish there with a <hi>lovers flames,</hi> who is enslave by a <hi>proud beauty</hi>; thou employest <hi>Choler,</hi> to disabuse a <hi>Souldier,</hi> whom a dissembling <hi>General</hi> feeds with vain hopes; <hi>thou</hi> makest excellent <hi>use</hi> of <hi>Grief</hi> to cure a <hi>sick man,</hi> who sought for his <hi>Souls happiness</hi> in his <hi>Bodies health,</hi> and lost the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of <hi>Heaven</hi> by being to strongly fastened to the <hi>Earth.</hi> In fine, <hi>thou</hi> makest <hi>Chains</hi> of all our <hi>Passions,</hi> to unite <hi>our Wills</hi> to <hi>thine thou</hi> minglest <hi>Grace</hi> with <hi>Nature</hi>; and makest <hi>Angels</hi> by the same dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, as they would have been made <hi>Devils.

               <hi>Charity</hi> begins to reign in their <hi>souls,</hi> they <hi>fear</hi> nothing but <hi>sin,</hi> they <hi>wish</hi> for nothing but <hi>Grace.

            <p>But certainly, if <hi>thy Mercy</hi> appear in well husbanding the inclinations of <hi>thy Friends,</hi> to their <hi>salvation; thy Iustice</hi> shines forth no less, in making good use of those of thine <hi>Enemies,</hi> to their <hi>Destruction:</hi> For they become <hi>chains</hi> in <hi>thy hands,</hi> to bind these <hi>Malefactors</hi> with; <hi>thou</hi> forgest out of them <hi>Irons</hi> to punish

                     <p>Their discourses which ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions unto virtue, have only been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives against passions.

                     <p>Others little differing from the last, have
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62020:26"/>
endeavoured to stifle Passion, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that man is indued with a body, from the material part, whereof the soul is not disingaged, they will heighten him to the condition of Angels.

                     <p>No man is ignorant, how that Pride hath alwaies accompanied the Sect of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> who that they might raise up man, have laboured to abase God, and who oft-times have made their Wise-man somewhat more happy than their <hi>Iupiter.</hi> They have given him the upper hand of Fortune and Desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and will have his happiness to depend wholly upon his Will. Virtue is too modest to allow of so unjust praises; and Piety will not suffer her to agrandise her self to the prejudice of that Divinity which she adores; but the vanity of these insolent Philosophers never appeared more, than in the defiance they have given to Passion; For as she is the motion of the most incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate part of our Soul. Pride hath made them eloquent in their Invectives, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition

hath furnished them with Reasons, which are fairly entertained by such men, who are offended that they have a Body, and afflicted that they are not Angels. They say, that rest cannot consist with Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that it is easier to destroy than to regulate them; that such Souldiers must never be made use of as spurn at the Orders of their Commanders; and that such are readier to justle reason out of doors, than to fight in her behalf; That Passions are the sickness of the Soul.<note n="*" place="margin">Quatiator necesse est fluctuetorque <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>To part the Soul from the Body, so to

exempt it from these agitations, were to overthrow the Fabrick of man; As long as this illustrious Prisoner shall be obliged to the same functions, as are the souls of ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational Creatures, she shall be constrained to entertain Passions; And as long as she shall make use of sense, in her operations, she shall use hope. and fear, in the practical part of virtue. It is no more dishonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the soul to fear a danger, to hope for good, or to strengthen it self against evil, than it is to see by the Organs of the Eyes, or to hear by those of the Ears; the one and the other shares of servitude, but both are necessary. It is also more easie to rule Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than the Senses; Fear, Choler and Love are more capable of Reason, than is Hunger, Thirst, or Sleep. Therefore if we shall make the Senses subject to the Empire of Reason, we may well submit our Passions thereunto, and make our Fear and our Hope praise-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, as well as our Fasting and Watching me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious.</p>
                     <p>Reason is the proper Utensil of man; all other things are bun as strangers to him, he may lose them without impoverishing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and as long as he is master of Reason, he may still vaunt himself to be Man.</p>
                     <p>Since this is the chief of all that is good,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62020:28"/>
we must disperse it through all the parts of man, and make even the meanest faculties of our Soul capable thereof; doubtlesly it may make for our security, if it be well husbanded. Hope, if well governed, doth encourage us to generous and difficult enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes; Audacity, if well guided, makes Souldiers invincible. In fine, our most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent Passions may be subject to Reason, and not to employ them in the course of our life, is to render useless one of the most beautiful parts of our Soul. Virtue her self would become idle, had she no passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, either to subdue or regulate. And he who shall consider their chief employment, will find they have a relation to the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of our actions. Fortitude is made use of to subjugate Fear, and this couragious vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue would cease to operate, if man did cease to fear. We measure our desires and hopes by Moderation, and were there no ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Passions, no man would be moderate in his good successes. Temperance and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency bridle Sensuality, and had not Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ordained pleasure in all actions, these two Virtues which go to the composure of a chaste and continent man, would be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of no use. Clemency sweetens Choler, and did not this Passion animate

Princes to revenge, the virtue whereby it is moderated would not deserve praise.</p>
                     <p>But if Passions be so much befriended by so many several virtues, they are not—thereof unthankful, for when instructed in their whole, they repay them with use, and serve them faithfully; The best part of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection is composed of Fear, which though it be accused to seek out the evil before it happen, it prepares us either quietly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo it, or happily to evade it. Hope is serviceable to Fortitude, and 'tis she that by her Promises doth encourage us to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of gallant Actions. Boldness is Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour's faithful Companion, and all great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors owe the glory of their Generosity to this Passion. Choler maintains Justice, and animates Judges to punish the Guilty. Briefly, there is no Passion which is not ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to Virtue, when they are governed by Reason, and those who have so cried them down, make us see they never knew their use nor worth.</p>

                     <p>Prophane <hi>Philosophy</hi> arriving at length to the knowledge of this truth, makes use of divers comparisons to express her. Now
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62020:30"/>
she represents the Soul in the Body, as an Intelligence in the Heavens, the virtue whereof is displayed through all the Spheres thereof. Anon they figure her out unto us as a Pilot, who guides his Vessel; sometimes as a King, who governs his State: But Christian <hi>Philosophy</hi> hath been more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, when coming even to the original of the soul, it hath made us know, what effects she produceth in the Body, by the very same which God produceth in the world. For though this infinite essence depends not upon the world which he hath created, and that without interessing his might, he may undo his own workmanship, yet is he shed abroad in all the parts thereof; there is no <hi>intermedium</hi> which he fills not up. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies himself to all Creatures, in their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and without dividing his unity, or weakning his power; he gives light with the Sun, he burneth with the fire, he he refresheth with the water, and he brings forth fruit with the trees. He is as great on earth as he is in Heaven, though his effects do differ; his power is alwaies equal, and the stars which shine above our heads cost him no more than the grass which we tread under our feet. So is the soul dispersed in the body, and penetrates all the parts
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62020:31"/>
thereof; It is as noble in the hand as in the heart; and though applying her self to the disposition of the Organs, she speaks by the Mouth, seeth by the Eyes, and heareth by the Ears, yet is she but one Spirit in her Essence; and in her differing Functions, her Unity is not divided, nor her Power weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. 'Tis true, that not finding the same dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, in every part of the Body, she produceth not the same Effects; and in this point this Illustrious Captive is infinitely inferiour to God; for as he is infinite, and was able to make all things out of nothing, he can likewise make all things out of every Creature, and without any respect to their Inclinations make them serve his <note n="d" place="margin">Voluntas tanti utique Conditoris rei cujusque natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra est; <hi>Aug. l.</hi> 21. <hi>De Civ. Dei.</hi> c. 8.</note> Will. So we see he hath used the Fire to sweeten the pains of his Servants; that he hath used the Light to blind his Enemies; that he hath made the Flouds turn back to give passage to his Friends; and that he hath made the Earth open to swallow those that rebell against him. But the Soul, whose power is limited, cannot operate without dependance upon the Organs; and though she be spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in her Nature, yet is she corporeal in her Operations.</p>
                     <p>This is that which hath made the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers</hi> consider her in three several estates,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62020:31"/>
which are so different the one from the other, that if in the first, she approach near the Dignity of the Angels, in the second she is in no better condition than the Beast of the Field; and in the last, she differs not much from the Nature of Plants; for in this acceptation she hath no other em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, than to nourish the Body she is in, to digest Food, to convert it into Bloud, and by a strange <hi>Metamorphosis</hi> to make one and the same Matter thicken into Flesh, stif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fen into Nerves, harden into Bones, extend into Branches, and lengthen into Grisles; she augments her Parts by nourishing them, she in time perfects her Workmanship, and by her pains brings it to its just Greatness. Solicited by Providence, she takes care to maintain the World; she thinks how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store what she hath received, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve her species produceth the like. In this acception her workmanship is not more noble than that of Plants,<note place="margin">Alba lilia iis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem omnibus modis serun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur quibus rosa &amp; hoc ampliu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In the second estate, she becomes sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and begins to have inclinations and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, she sees Objects by the Sense which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62020:32"/>
their reports make unto the Imagination, this trusts them or commits them to memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which obligeth her self carefully to keep them, and faithfully to represent them. From the Lights of the Soul arise her desires, and from her knowledge, her love or hatred, she betakes her self to that which is agreeable unto her, shuns that which likes her not; and according to the divers qualities of good or evil which present themselves, she excites differing motions, which are called Passions: In this degree she hath nothing of more lofty than the Beasts, which discover Objects by Sense, which receive the sorts thereof in their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and preserve them in their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
                     <p>In the third estate, she quits the Body, and coming to her self, she entertains her self with more Truths, she treats with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and mounting by degrees even to Divinity it self, she knows perfections, and admireth greatness; she reasons upon such subjects as present themselves, she exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines their qualities, that she may conceive their essence, she confers the present with what is past, and from the one and the other of them draws Conjectures for what is to come.</p>

                     <p>True it is that motions or agitations are formed in the second acception of the soul which exercise her power; for though they hold of her, they forbear not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to some sort of Liberty; they are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her Citizens than her Slaves, and she is rather their Judge than their Soveraign. These Passions arising from the Senses side
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62020:33"/>
alwaies with them; whenever Imagination presents them to the Understanding, he pleads in their behalf, by means of so good an Advocate they corrupt their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and win all their Causes. The Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding listens unto them, weigheth their Reasons, considereth their Inclinations, and lest he may grieve them, oft-times gives Sentence to their Advantage; he betrayes the Will, whereof he is the Chief Officer; he couzens his Blind Queen, and disguising the Truth, makes unfaithful Reports unto her, that he may draw unjust Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from her; when she hath declared her self, Passions become Crimes, their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition begins to make head, and man who before was but unruly, becomes wholly Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal; for as the Motions of this inferiour part of the Soul are not free, they never begin to be vitious but when they become voluntary. As long as they are awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Objects, solicited by the Senses, and protected by Imaginations self, they have no other Craft than what they draw from corrupted Nature; But when the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing overshadowed by their obscurity, or won by their solicitations, perverts the Will, and obliges this Soveraign to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her the interest of her Slaves, she makes
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62020:33"/>
them guilty of her sin, she changes their motions into rebellion, and of the insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of a Beast, makes the fault of a man. It is true, that when the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing keeps within the bounds of duty, and is faithful to the Will, he suppresses their seditions, and reduceth these Mutineers to obedience; she husbandeth their humours so well, as taking from them all their unru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, he makes rare and excellent virtues of them. In this estate they are subservient to Reason, and defend the party which they were resolved to fight against. The good or the evil that may be drawn from them binds us to consider their nature, to observe their proprieties, and to discover their original, to the end that arriving at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act knowledge of them, we may make use of them in our affairs.</p>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62020:34"/>
fill'd with sorts of things, which she hath received from all the senses, sollicits passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to discover unto her the beauties or deformities of such Objects as may move her. The sensitive appetite is so partial to her as it sooths her in all her inclinations, let her be never so little agitated, she draws after her all other passions, she raiseth tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests as winds do waves, and the Soul would be at quiet in her interiour part, were she not moved by this power; but she bears so great a sway in this Empire, as she there doth what she pleaseth. Nor is it requisite that the good or evil which she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents to the appetite be true, which rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on her fidelity, and believes her councils without examining them, having no other light but what is borrowed from her, he follows hoodwink'd all the Objects which she proposeth, and let them be but cloathed with any appearance of good or evil, he impetuously either rejects or embraceth them. He behaves himself so vigorously, as he alwaies causeth alteration in the Body; for besides that his motions are violent, and that they do hardly deserve the name of Passions, when they are moderated, they have such access unto the Senses, and the Senses have so much of communication
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62020:34"/>
with the Body, as it is impossible but that their Disorders should cause an alteration therein. In brief, Passion is against the Law of Nature, because she sets upon the heart; which cannot be hurt, without resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the parts of the Body; for they are Looking-glasses, wherein one sees all the Motions of him that animates them; And as Physitians judge of his Constitution by the beating of his Pulse, and Arteries, one may judge of the Passions wherewith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Were it not a error in morality to dispute this Maxim, and were it not rashness to contradict an opinion generally receiv'd for so many ages; I should be much inclined to believe that all these passions are lodged in one and the same appetite, which is divided by the motions thereof, as the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is divided by its opinions, or as the will is parted by love and hatred. And I would say with Saint <hi>Augustin,</hi> that these differing conceits, do not presuppose diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring faculties, since one and the same man doth oftentimes desire contrary things, and preserveth the unity of his person in the variety of his desires. He experienced this
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62020:37"/>
combat in himself, when he would become a Convert; he saw his soul divided by dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering opinions, and wondered that having but one Will, it could form out so contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry resolutions. But not to engage my self in a War wherein a man purchaseth more Enemies than he reconcileth, and where both Parties think alwaies to have had the better; I will content my self to have insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated my opinion, instead of staying upon the defence thereof, and not concluding any thing of the Subject where the Passions do reside, I wiil speak of their Number; and will tell you what the <hi>Philosophers</hi> have written thereof.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Academicks</hi> thought there were but four principal Passions, Desire and Fear, Joy and Sorrow; and <note n="*" place="margin">Hine metu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt, cupiunt, gaudentque, dolentque. <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Virgil</hi> who in all his works appears to be of this ancient Sect, when he describes the motions of the Soul, mentions none but these; in effect it seems these comprehend all the rest; that Despair and Aversion are ranked under Fear; that Hope, Audacity, &amp; Choler are ranked under Desire; &amp; that all of them together do ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in Joy or Sorrow. But let them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to colour over this division, by what reasons they please, it will still be defective since it comprehendeth not Love and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,

which are the two first originals of our Passions; for this reason the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> did multiply them, and grounded their Number upon the divers motions of the Soul; for the Soul hath (say they) either an inclination, or an aversion to the Objects wherewith she is either pleased or displeas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and this is Love or hatred; or else she shuns them, and this is Eschewing; or she draws near unto them, and this is De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ire; or she promiseth unto her self the fruition of what she wisheth; and this is Hope; or she cannot defend her self from the evil which she apprehends, and this is Despair; or she endeavours to withstand it, and this is Audacity; or she chears her self up to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them, and this is Choler. Finally, she either possesseth the good, and this is Joy; or suffereth the evil, and this is sorrow: some others that are of the like opinion, prove the diversity of Passions another way, and affirm that good and evil may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in themselves, without any Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances; and that from hence arise Love and Hatred; or that a man may look upon them as absent; and that then they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce either Fear or Desire; or as difficult, and that then they cause Hope, Audacity, and Choler; or as impossible, and that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62020:38"/>
then they raise despair; or in fine, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and that then they pour into the soul either delight or pain.</p>
                     <p>Though these reasons may content the understanding, yet do they not vanquish her; and without offence to <hi>Philosophy,</hi> a man may differ from the opinions of <hi>Plato,</hi> or <hi>Aristotle,</hi> for as it appears to me, they give several names to one and the same thing, they divide the unity of Love, and take her different effects for different Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. So after having well examined this business, I am inforced to embrace the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> and to maintain with him, that love is the only passion which doth agitate us, or hath operation in us. For all the motions which molest our soul are but so many disguised loves; our Fears and Desires, our Hopes and Despaires, our Delights and Sorrows, are Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances which Love puts on according to the events of good or bad success: and as the Sea carries divers names according to the different parts of the Earth which are thereby watered, so doth Love change her name according to the different estates wherein she finds her self. But as amongst the Infidels every perfection of God hath past for a several Deity; so amongst <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers</hi>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:62020:38"/>
the different qualities of love have been taken for different Passions. And these great Masters have opinioned that as oft as Love hath changed guidance, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, she ought also to change nature and name; but if this their reasoning were good, the soul must lose its unity as oft as it produceth different effects: and the Soul which digests Meat, and distributes the Bloud into the Veins, must not be the same which speaks by the tongue, and lissens by the Ear.</p>
                     <p>Reason therefore will have us to believe, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> of love; and that to paint her in all her colours, we must term her, when longing after what is loved, Desire <note n="*" place="margin">Amor ergo inhians habere quod amatur, cupiditas est; idem habens, eoque fruens, laetitia est; fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giens quod ei adversatur, ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor est; id<expan>

triumph, despair her weakness, and sadness her defeat. Or to make use of Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines</hi> words, desire is the course of Love, fear is her flight, sorrow is her torment, and joy her rest; Love draws near to good by desiring it, flies from evil by fearing it, is sad by resenting sorrow, rejoiceth in tasting pleasure, but in all her different estates or acceptions she is alwaies her self, and in the variety of her effects, preserves the unity of her essence.</p>
                     <p>But if it be trne that Love causeth all our Passion, it follows that she must some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times transform her self into her contrary; and that by a Metamorphosis more incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than that of the Poets, she converts her self into Hatred, and produceth effects which will give the Lie to her Humour. For Love delights in obliging, Hate in the contrary; Love is generous, and takes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in pardoning, Hate not so, and studies nothing but revenge; Love gives life unto her enemies, Hatred endeavours the death of her most faithful friends; and it seems more easie to reconcile Vice with Virtue, than Love with Hatred. This Objection hath much of apperance, but little of soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity; and those who frame it, do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that oft times one and the same
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62020:39"/>
cause doth produce contrary effects. That heat which makes Wax melt, dries mud and dirt; that the motion which draws us nearer Heaven, draws us the further from earth; that the inclination we have to preserve our selves, is an aversion from any thing that may destroy us. So the love of good is the hatred of evil; and the same Passion which useth sweetness to those who oblige it, useth severity to those who offend it. It imitateth Justice, which by the same moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on punisheth sin, and recompenseth virtue. It resembles the Sun, which by the same Light makes the Eagles see, and blinds the Owles. And if it be lawful to mount up into the Heavens, it hath an influence upon God himself, which only hates a sinner, out of love unto himself: If so many good reasons cannot perswade to so manifest a truth, they ought at least prevail thus much with our adversaries, that if there be divers Passions, Love is the Soveraign thereof, and that she is so absolute in her Kingdom, as that her Subjects undertake nothing but by her directions. She is the <hi>primum Mobile</hi> which carries them about; and as she gives them motion, so she gives them rest; she by her aspect doth irritate and appease them: and her examples do prevail so much over

The first is Voluptuousness, which belies its name, and which breathing forth nothing but sweetness, ceaseth not to be extream furious; and to fight against reason with more violence than doth grief or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62020:40"/>
The second is Choler, which being nothing else according to its definition, but a boiling of the Blood about the heart <note n="*" place="margin">Fervor sangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinis circa cor. <hi>Aristo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </note>, cannot be but excessively violent; and did not nature, which is careful of our preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, make it die as soon as it is born, there were no mischief whereof it were not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; nor do I know whether the world were capable to defend it self against the fury thereof, or no. But let us attribute what violence we please unto it, I esteem it more reasonable than Voluptuousness; for as Lions are sooner tamed than Fish, an angry man is sooner appeased, than a voluptuous man converted; and experience teacheth us, that of these two Passions the more mild is the less tractable, and the more furious the less opinionated. The third is the desire of honour, which is so powerfully imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the heart of man, as there is no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty which it overcomes not. 'Tis this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>everal ways, they aim at the same end. The fourth is the fear of death, which by its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

our life. It produceth such strange effects, as the nature thereof is not to be discover'd though it be timerous, and that the shadow of an evil is sufficient to astonish it; yet doth it render men couragious, and make them seek out a certain death, to shun an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain one; it giveth strength to the vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and assisted by despair, it regains Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels which it had lost. 'Tis hard to judge which of these two Passions is the stronger, for they have oft times triumphed over one another, and as the fear of death hath made the desire of honour be forgotten, sometimes the desire of honour hath despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the fear of Death.</p>
                     <p>Though I have a noble esteem of <hi>Plato,</hi> and that his very ravings seem more noble, and more heightned to me than <hi>Aristotles</hi> Discourses, yet cannot I side with him in this; and notwithstanding all the good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons he alledgeth to defend his opinion, I cannot approve thereof. For Voluptuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is not so much a particular Passion, as it is the Spring-head of all those that give us any contentment, nor is it so violent, but that it may easily be repress'd by grief and anguish. Its only advantage lieth in the absence of its enemy, nor doth it corrupt men but when it findeth nothing to oppug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And as contraries cannot lodge or habit together, without fighting, it must necessarily follow, that these two enemy-Passions make wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> one upon another, and that all other that are subject unto them take up arms to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their interests, in so much as a jealous man finds himself seized on by Fear, and Audacity, by Hope and Despair, by Joy and Sadness, because he is struck with Love
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62020:43"/>
and hatred; likewise the Holy Scripture, the very 'simplicity whereof is eloquent, not finding any thing that can express the fury of Jealousie,<note place="margin">Fortis ut mors dilectio, dura sicut infernus aemulatio. <hi>Caur. Cant.</hi>
                        </note> goes to seek out Death amongst the Sepulchres, and Hell in the Bowels of the earth, to give us a Picture thereof; according to this maxim we must conclude that the jealous are the damned of this world, and that the Passion which torments them is a punishment which equals that of the Devils. After the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Scripture, a man must be very rash to oppose this opinion, which it seems all things conspire to make veritable; yet may it be replied upon; and the very self same reasons which it produceth for its defence, may serve to condemn it; for though Jealousie be a mixture of Love and Hatred, it follows not that she must be most violent of all our Passions; the very same whereof she is composed, would not agree together were they not sweetned. And as the Elements cannot make one and the same Body, unless their qualities be moderated, so cannot all these Passions form our jealousie unless they be tempered; and it must necessarily ensue that Love weakens hatred, that joy moderates Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and that Hope sweetens Despair. It
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62020:44"/>
hath been observed that two Passions ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken together, lose their force, and that serving as an Antidote one against another, they do no mischief; or if they do any, they cure it again. So in Jealousie Love is the Antidote to Hatred; the jealous man suffers little harm, because he hath many Passions, and he may boast, that by a strange destiny, he owes his welfare to the number of his Enemies.</p>
                     <p>But since after having worsted a Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood a Truth must be established, let us say that according to our principles this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not hard to resolve; for as we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge but one passion, which is Love, and that all the rest are but effects of her producing, we are bound to confess, that they borrow all their efficacy from their Cause; and that they have no other violence than what is hers. Love is a Soveraign which imprints his qualities in his Subjects; a Captain which imparts part of his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to his Souldiers; and 'tis a <hi>Primum Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile</hi> which bears about all the other heavens by its Impetuosity; insomuch as Morality ought only endeavour how to govern Love; for when this Passion shall be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somly ruled, all other will imitate her. And he knows well how to love, or
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62020:44"/>
how to love well, shall have no evil desires, nor vain hopes to moderate.</p>

                     <p>TIs so long since we lost our Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, as there remains nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us but a weak <hi>Idaea</hi> thereof; and did not Divine Justice punish the Fathers fault in the Children, we should likewise have lost the Sorrow for it. Every one describes the felicity of that state according to his Imagination; methinks a man may say that as many as speak thereof, guide themselves according to their inclinations; and that they place there, such pleasures as they are acquainted with, and do most desire. Some say the whole earth was one Paradise; that of the Seasons, whereof our years are composed, there was only Autumn, and the Spring: that all Trees
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62020:45"/>
had the property of Orange trees, and that they were at all times loaded with leaves, flowers, and fruit; others perswade themselves that no wind blew there, but the South-west; and that the ground un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated prevented our need, and brought forth all things. I think that without maintaining these Opinions a man may say, that in this happy condition bad was not mingled with good, and that the qualities of the Elements were so well tempered, as that man did thereby receive all content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and felt no Displeasure. He had no disorders to reform; no enemies to fight withal, nor mischiefs to eschew; all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures conspired towards his felicity; the beasts bare respect unto his person; and it may be that even those which remained in the Forrests were not wild; as the Earth bare no Thorns, and all the parts thereof were fruitful and pleasing, so had not the Heavens any malign influences, and that Constellation which dispenseth Life and Death in nature, had no aspect which was not innocent, and favourable. If there be so little certainty touching the state of man, there is no more assurance for what regards his person; we argue according to our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, and as in the first ages Idols
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62020:45"/>
were made of all particulars; every one shapes out a felicity for <hi>Adam,</hi> and gives him all the advantages that may be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                     <p>Amongst so many Opinions or Errors, I see nothing more consonant to reason then that which Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> writes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this;<note place="margin">Absit enim ut illa beatitudo ut possit aut in loco illo non habere quod vellet, aut in suo corpore vel animo sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire quod nol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let. <hi>August.</hi>

                        </gap>o believe he found in his habitation, whatsoever he could wish; and that he felt nothing in his body which could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodiate him. His constitution was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, his health was unalterable, and if time could weaken it, he prevented that mischief, by making use of the tree of life, which repairing his forces, furnish'd him with new vigor. He was immortal, not by Nature, but by Grace; and he knew that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>in could not bereave him of Life, without making him lose his Innocence. His Soul was no less happily constituted than was his Body; for besides that he was infused
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62020:46"/>
with all Sciences, that he knew all the Secrets of Nature, and that he was not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of any thing which could contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to his Felicity; his Memory was happy, his will had alwaies good Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, his Affections were regulated; and though he were not insensible, he was of so equal a temper, as nothing could trouble his repose. The Passions, which by their violence, do anticipate Reason, waited his Directions, and never shewed themselves till they had received Commandment from him. In fine, his Passions were no less natural than are ours, but they were more tractable; and as his Constitution made him capable of all our motions, ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Justice exempted him from all our Disorders. I know not whether I fall foul on the opinion of Divines, but forasmuch as a man may see in this darkness, I think I injure not the Truth; for if man as being composed of a Body was Mortal, and as being honoured with original Grace, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, methinks one may consequently infer, that not being a pure Spirit, he had Passions, but that being sanctified in all the faculties of his Soul, all his Passions were innocent. To give all the force that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to this Assertion, we must inlarge its
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62020:46"/>
Principle, and prove with Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> that man might die, losing Original Justice; and that Immortality was rather a Grace from Heaven than a property of his Nature; for if he had been truly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, he had needed no sustenance, and if death had not been natural unto him, he had needed no priviledge to have secured him from it; since he did eat to preserve Life, it follows he might lose it; and since he was obliged to defend himself against old age, by the means of a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous fruit, it follows necessarily, he might die, and that his Life as well as ours needed remedies against Death. I confess that they being better than are ours, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired his strength more advantageously, and that by prolonging the course of his Life, they kept the hour of his Death far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off; I affirm likewise that they kept away corruption from his Body, and that they kept him in so perfect a health, as that it could not be altered; but then they must likewise grant me, that if man had not used these remedies, his natural heat had consumed his <hi>Humidum Radicale</hi>; and that old age succeeding this Disorder, he must inevitably have died. All these Maximes are to serve, as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> is
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62020:47"/>
obliged to confess, that if the use of the tree of life were permitted unto us in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition wherein we are,<note place="margin">Nec enim corpus ejus tale erat quod dissolvi impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibile videre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, sed gustus arboris vitae corruptionem corporis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibebat.

                     <p>I verily conceive there may be some Passions, the use whereof were interdicted him, and that though he were capable thereof, he was not therewithal agitated; because they would have troubled his quiet.

by his Soveraign Lord, he was sometimes flattered by hopes, sometimes astonished by fear, and by them both joined together kept within his duty. I doubt not likewise but that in the unhappy conference which our unwise Mother had with the Devil in the shape of a Serpent she was seized upon by as many Passions as usually People are, who consult upon any important affairs; that the Devils promises did stir up her hope, that God Almighties Threats did cause fear in her, and that the loveliness of the forbidden fruit did irritate her desire. I know not whether some other may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine this Dialogue could pass without some dispute, but I know very well that Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> (with whom I believe a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be mistaken) doth argue thus upon this subject <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

judging aright that their disorder could not accord with original Justice.

her evils, he would out of compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on resent them. Before the doing of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle he would undergo a weakness, and weep over a dead man, whom he went about to revive; He suffered sadness, often to seize upon his heart, and by a strange wonder, he accorded joy with sorrow in his all-blessed soul.

Since he had a true body he could have no false Passions; and since he was veritably man, he ought to be veretably afflicted. A man gannot gainsay this truth without weakening our belief.

But we must have a care left whilst we establish the love of the Son of God, we commit no outrage upon his Greatness, or Omnipotency, and that whilst we allow him Passions, we free them from their Disorders; for we must not believe that they were unruly, as are ours, nor that they required all those virtues to tame them as are necessary for us.

In this happy estate, the soul commanded with mildness, the body obeyed with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and whatsoever object presented it self, these two parties did always agree. But this happiness continued no longer than our first father was obedient to God; as soon as he listened to the devil, and that inticed by his promises he had took part with him, his punishment was answerable to his fault, and his disobedience was punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a general rebellion; for to boote that his creatures revolted against him, and that his subjects, that they might serve Gods justice, became his enemies, the revolt pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from his condition to his person; the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62020:53"/>
elements divided themselves in his body, and his Body mutinied against his Soul. This intestine war was the sooner kindled, between these two parties, for that their peace was not so much an effect of Nature as of Grace; the hatred which succeeded their love was so much the more violent, for that it was animated by sin, which being but a meer disorder, causeth divisions every where, and satisfieth its own fury in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the decrees of divine Justice; so as we must not wonder if the rebellion which man suffers, be so great, since it takes its rise from two so puissant principles, and that the parties which compose it are incouraged to the combat by the contrariety of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and by the malice of sin, which doth possess them. This mischief hath caused the greatest Saints to sigh. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle of the Gentiles, finding no remedy for this malady, but death, wish'd for it as a favour, and as such a one, made suit for the most rigorous of our punishments; he in his Writings,<note place="margin">Caro enim concupiscit adversus spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, spiritus autem adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus carnem. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.</note> hath prepared all Christians to this War, and hath made them know that a man cannot hope for peace in this life, since the body made enterprizes upon the soul, and that the soul was obliged evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to intreat her Body.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:62020:53"/>From this great disorder the like of our Passions have ensued; for though they be the off-spring of the soul and body, &amp; that being equally produced by these two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they should endeavour their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet these unnatural children, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their division, and according as they hold more of the soul or the body, take part with the one, or with the other of them, and perform no act of Obedience wherein there is not somewhat of Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The concupiscible appetite doth almost always hold intelligence with the body, and the irascible appetite sides always with the soul. The first engages us in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and keeps us in a shameful Idleness; the second arms us against sorrow, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth us to generous actions; in this continual bickering the soul of man is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at quiet, and man is constrained to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Vipers which do devour him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Philosophers</hi> have indeed found this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, but they thought it lay only in the Will, and not in the Nature of man. They were perswaded, that opinion and ill bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding caused these disorders, and that as one evil is cured by its contrary, this might be remedied by wholsom doctrine, and good education. They founded Academies,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62020:54"/>
wherein they disputed about the <hi>Summum bonum.</hi> They made <hi>Panegyricks</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of virtue, and Invectives against vice. They declaimed against the unruliness of Passions; and measuring their abilities by their desires, they promised victory and tryumph to themselves. But not finding the original of the malady, by consequence they could never light upon the remedy; amidst the weakness they underwent, and their vain indevours, they were enforced to accuse nature, and to complain even of that soveraign Power which hath composed man of pieces, which could not be made agree. A glimpse of light would certainly have rectified them, and a Chapter of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> would have made them know the truth; for since they agreed with us that God cannot be defective in his workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and that he is too just to require things at our hands which exceed our power, they must have concluded that our disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was the punishment of our sin, and that the infirmity which we lament was not an effect of our nature, but the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Gods Justice; by thinking thus they would have endeavoured to appease him whom they had injured, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing their infirmity, they would have
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62020:54"/>
implored his assistance; but pride blinded them, and to make use of <hi>Seneca</hi>'s words against himself, they would rather accuse providence, than acknowledge their own misery; and rather impute their disorder to Gods rigour, than to their own offences. They either could not, or would not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, what reason taught them before,<note place="margin">Quod caro concupiscit ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versus spiritum, non est praece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders naturae hominis insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The same power which formerly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded our soul with our body, must now end these differences.

                     <p>THough the Stoicks be declared ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies unto Passions, and that they cannot be judged in a cause wherein they are a party, yet methinks their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have some colour of Justice, and that it is with reason that they do mix our Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with our Vices. For in the condition whereinto Sin hath reduced us, our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions are no more pure, our nature being corrupted, all the inclinations thereof must needs be out of order, and the rivers which run from a polluted Spring must needs be troubled.</p>
                     <p>I know <hi>Philosophers</hi> will not agree of this truth, and they never permit us to accuse Nature of an error, since they take her for their guide, nor that we dishonour her, all whose motions they esteem so regular. They profess to follow her in all things, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62020:55"/>
hold that to live happily, a man must live according to Nature. The <hi>Libertines</hi> plead this Maxim, and will excuse their disorders by a Doctrine which they understand not; for had they studied in the <hi>Stoicks</hi> Schools, they would find that those <hi>Philosophers</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose that Nature was in her first purity, and that they took her not for their guide, but for that they imagined she had preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her innocency. So banished they from their Sages, and even from their Disciples all those Affections, which they would have pass for natural, and by a generous, but a useless endeavour, they would have us to be as well governed in the state of sin, as in that of Original Justice.</p>
                     <p>But Christians who have learn'd by the Holy Scripture, that nature is fallen from her first purity, are bound to confess, that the Passions have revolted, and that to bring them again into subjection Reason must be assisted by Grace; for there is no man, but sees that the understanding is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the Errour, and that it confusedly receives falshoods and truths: that the will applies it self more to appearing, than to real good; that her interests are the rules of her inclinations, and that she loves not that which is good, save that she is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62020:56"/>
delighted; that by experience she finds, she hath lost much of her liberty; and that if sin hath not taken from her all the love she had to good, it hath left her but weak helps, and useless desires to come by it. As her forces are but small, to atchieve what is good, she hath yet smaller power to rule her Passions; and though she ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove not of their disorders, she knows not how to remedy them. Oft times by a strange misfortune, she foments their sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which she ought to hinder, and that she may not afflict her Subjects, she becomes guilty of their crimes. The Christian <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher</hi> is therefore bound to employ aid from Heaven to overcome these Rebels, and confessing that his Reason is weakned, he must look for help from without himself, and beg favour from him who hath permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the unruliness of Nature for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of Sin.</p>
                     <p>But that we may not be said to be ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the greatness of man, and that we make his disaster greater than it is, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that nature is good in her foundation, and that very sin is an excellent proof there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; for as it is but a <hi>Non Ens,</hi> it cannot sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist by it self, for its preservation it must needs fasten it self to some subject that may
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62020:56"/>
uphold it, and which may impart unto it part of its essence. So evil is ingraffed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good, and sin is upholden by nature; which is much endamaged by so evil a guest, but doth not therefore lose all the advantages thereof. For since she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves her own being, she must likewise conserve unto her self some goodness, since she is not annihilated for being become cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, she must amidst her misery enjoy some good fortune, and amidst her faultiness some tincture of innocence must remain. And this is it which Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> affirms in as learned as eloquent terms.<note place="margin">Cujus recte vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuperatur viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um procul du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bio Natura laudatur: nam recte vitii vitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratio est, quod illo de honestatur na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura laudabilis. <hi>August. lib.</hi> 12. <hi>de Civitate Dei. cap.</hi> 1.</note> The being of man is certainly praised, though the sin thereof be blamed, and no better reason can be given, for the blaming of sin, than by making it appear that by the contagion thereof, it dishonoureth what was honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by nature. If we consider her then in her ground-work or foundation, she hath lost nothing of her goodness; but if we look upon her, under the tyranny of sin, she hath almost lost her use, and she can make no more use of her faculties, unless freed from the enemy which possesseth her; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks she may be compared to the birds that are taken in nets; they have wings but cannot fly, they love liberty but cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62020:57"/>
it. So men in the state of sin, have good inclinations, but they cannot pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue them, they have good designes but cannot put them in execution; and more unfortunate than the aforenamed Birds they love their prison, and agree with the Tyrant that doth persecute them. In this sad condition, they have need of Grace to comfort them, and to strengthen them, if not totally to free them from the enemy which pursueth them, at least to give them liberty of operating, and to put them into a capacity of practising virtue, of contesting with vice, and of ruling their Passions.</p>

Though humane Nature (saith Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>) had continued in the integrity wherein God created it, yet could it not have preserved it self against Sin without Grace; and drawing a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence from this first truth, he with a great

deal of reason adds; since man without Grace, could not preserve the purity which he had received; how can he without the same recover the purity which he hath lost? he must then resolve to submit himself to his Creator, if he will assubject his Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and he must become pious if he will be reasonable.

And though we have the pledges of these gracious promises, we do not as yet enjoy all the effects thereof. The grace which purchaseth this right for us, resides in the depth of our soul, the which she sanctifieth, leaving the body engaged in sin. She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins the work of our salvation, but doth not finish it; she divides the two parts whereof man is composed, and giving strength unto the Spirit, she leaves the flesh in its weakness. But by a stranger miracle she parts the soul from the Spirit, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a division in their unity, for to take her aright; 'tis only the superior part of the soul which doth fully resent the effects of Grace, and which in Baptism receives the virtue of that divine character which gives us right to Heaven, as to our inheritance.

'Tis true that this weakness or defection is not a sin; and though it be the Spring-head from whence all the rest do derive, it cannot make us blameable, unless when by reason of our remissness we follow the motions thereof. And it cannot be said with honour to our Soul, that this disorder is in our Body, and that the Soul is not affected therewithal, save only out of pity,<note place="margin">Non enim ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro sine anima concupiscit, quamvis caro concupiscere dicatur, quia carnaliter ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit. <hi>Aug</hi> lib. <hi>De perfectione bominis,</hi> c. 17.</note> or infected but by contagion: for besides that original sin, (whereof this misgovernment is an effect) abideth in her substance, all the world knoweth that the body is capable of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by its self, and that necessarily the soul which animates it, must be that which makes it revolt; and that that which gives it life, must give it irregular motions and desires. 'Tis she that raiseth the flesh against the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62020:59"/>
and which, as not being intirely possest by grace, doth obey sin. 'Tis she that awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens Passions; 'tis she who through a strange infatuation, or blindness, affords them weapons wherewithal to hurt her self, and who excites the sedition wherewithal to trouble her tranquility. This is Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> Doctrine; and if we had not so great a Doctor for our warranty, all Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy would serve us for caution, since ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the principles thereof we must believe, that the body doth nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the soul, and that even then when the body seems to undertake any thing maugre the soul, it is effected by the succour which the body receiveth from the soul. Insomuch as she is the rise of the evil, and without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son she complains of the bodies revolt, since she is the chief therein, and that of all the faults which she imputeth to the body, the body is not the Author, but only the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate.</p>
                     <p>Now as the Passions reside in that part of the soul which is infected by sin, we must not wonder if they rebel, since their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is disobedient. And we must not once think they should be stifled by Grace, since she suffers the very power which produceth them, to remain in rebellion. All that a

She goes not about to destroy them, because she very well knows, it is a work reserved for glory; but she employeth all her forces to regulate them; as she makes good use of sin, to humble her she wisely makes use of their revolt to exercise us. She propounds unto them Objects of Innocency to make them be serviceable to her virtue: and makes them (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saies) Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Justice; for Christian Humility is an enemy to the vanity of the <hi>Stoicks</hi>; and knowing very well that we are not Angels, but men, she doth not in vain endeavour to destroy one part of us, but she obligeth us to make advantage of our defaults, and to manage our Passions so dexterously, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Their excess is then only blameable, and Reason assisted by Grace ought to employ all her industry to moderate them.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62020:62"/>
for our faults; we seem to take pleasure in increasing them by our evil guidance, and that we invent every day new penalties, to which divine Justice had not condemned us; we are not contented to know our Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are revolted, and that without the assistance of Grace, Reason cannot regulate them; we nourish their disorder, and to make them the more insolent, we admit of Opinions which raise them up at their pleasure. For of a thousand Passions which are raised in our soul, there are not any two that take truth for their guide; and the evil which they apprehend, or the good which they desire, appear rather so to be, than that they are so indeed. To mend this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, we must take cognizance of opinion, mark her birth and progress. Opinion is not so much a judgment of the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as of the Imaginations, whereby she doth either approve of, or condemn things which the senses represent unto her. This is the most usual evil of our Life, and if it were as constant as it is common, our condition would be very sad; but it chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth at every moment, that which is the cause of its birth, causeth likewise the death thereof. And Imagination forsakes it with as much ease as she gave it entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62020:62"/>
It taketh its rise from our senses, and from the reports of the world, so as it is no marvel if the best grounded opinion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not subsist long, since the foundations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are so bad; for our senses are liars, and like inchanted glasses, they present disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Objects unto us. Their Reports are sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom uninteressed; and as they fasten them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to objects, they endeavour to engage Imagination.</p>
                     <p>When I consider the soul as a Prisoner in the body, I bewail her condition, and I wonder not if she so oft takes falshood for truth, because it entereth by the gate of the senses; this divine Spirit is inclosed in the body, not having any other cognizance save what she borroweth either from the Eyes or the Ears thereof; and these two senses which by nature seem so particularly appropriated to knowledge are such decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as their devices are for the most part but impostures; blindness is to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before their false Lights, and they had better leave us in our ignorance than help us to such malignant and so doubtful know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. They consider only the appearances of things; they stop at accidents, their weakness cannot penetrate into substances; they are like the Sun, and as they take all
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62020:63"/>
their light from him, they endeavour to imitate him in their actions. Every one thinks that this goodly Planet is extreamly useful to us when it comes about our Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon; and that it affords those beauties to nature which darkness had bereft it of. But the <hi>Platonicks</hi> have found that the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage we receive thereby, equals not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice it bringeth along with it; for when it discovers the earth unto us, it hides the Heavens from us; when it exposeth Lilies and Roses to our sight, it hinders us from seeing the Stars, and takes from us the sight of the most beautiful part of the world. So the senses take from us the cognizance of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things to furnish us with the like of what is humane. They make us only see the appearances of objects, and hide their truth from us. We remain ignorant under these bad Masters, and our Imagination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed but by their reports, we can only conceive false opinions.</p>
                     <p>I find therefore that Nature is more severe unto us than is Religion, and that it is much more difficult to be rational than to believe aright; for though the truths which Religion proposeth unto us, are of so high a nature as our understanding cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them, though she demand of us a
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62020:63"/>
blind obedience, and that to believe her mysteries, we must subdue our Reason, and give the Lie to all our Senses; yet this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is not injurious; If she take from us our liberty, she preserves our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, she frees our understanding from the tyranny of our senses, she submits it to the legitimate Empire of the supream Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, which she illustrates unto us by her light; she takes us from earth, that she may raise us up to Heaven, and takes not from us the use of Reason, save only to make us acquire the merit of Faith. But Nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging our soul in our body, makes her a slave to our senses, and obligeth her in her noblest operations, to consult with those that are blind; and to draw her light from out their darkness. Hence it is that all our knowledge is full of errour, and that truth is never without falshood, that opinions are uncertain, and that our Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which obey them, are always out of order.</p>
                     <p>The worlds report is no surer a Guide; and those who listen thereunto, are likely never to enjoy true rest; for this rumour is nothing else but the opinion of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which is not the truer for being the more common. That which seemeth to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62020:64"/>
authorize it doth condemn it; and nothing ought to make it more suspected than the great number of its partakers. The nature of man is not so well regulated, as that the best things be those that please most people; ill opinions, as well as good ones, ground themselves upon the number of their appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; and when we would side with any opinions, we ought not to number, but to weigh the Votes. The common people who gape after liberty, delight to live in servitude, never make use of Judgment, and in worldly affairs, which of all others ought to be the most free, they are rather led by Example than by Reason; they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low those who go before, and not exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their Opinions, they embrace, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them; for after having recived them, they desire to divulge them; as in factions, they endeavour to engage others on their Party, and to make their malady prove contagious. In so much as <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime proves true, That man is not only failing to himself,<note place="margin">Nemo sibi tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum errat, sed aliis erroris causa &amp; author est. <hi>De vita be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ata,</hi> c. 1.</note> but unto others, and that he communicates his errors to all those that come nigh him. When our Imagination is filled with ill Opinions, she exciteth a thousand disorders in the inferior part of our soul, and raiseth up Passions according
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62020:64"/>
to her pleasure; for being blind, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not discern whether the good or bad which is proposed to them, be only likely or true; and abused by the Imagination, whose Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire they reverence, they either draw nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer unto, or fly further from objects; their blindness serves them for excuse, and they lay their faults upon that hath deceived them. But to prevent this disorder, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding must keep it self in its authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it must assubject Imagination to its Laws; it must take heed lest opinion endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to establish her self, and must consult with Reason to defend it self against Errour and Falshood; thus will Passions always be peaceable, and their motions being regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they will be serviceable unto virtue.</p>

                     <head>The FIFTH DISCOURSE. That there is more disorder in the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of man, than in those of Beasts.</head>
                     <p>BEfore we resolve this question, we must discuss another, and examine whether
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62020:65"/>
beasts be capable of these motions which we call Passions. For as our Adversaries confound them with vices, and as they will have all the affections of the inferiour part of our soul to be criminal; they hold that beasts are exempt from them, and that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no freedom or liberty, one cannot impute unto them either Virtue, or Sin. That they are led on by an Instinct which cannot err, and if sometimes they seem to do amiss, we must attribute it to provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which disordereth them for our pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, or which suffereth their unruli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to put us in mind of our wickedness; 'tis therefore that their motions serve for plagues to all people, and that the Infidels took counsel by the flying of Birds, and the Entrails of Victims, that they might know what was to come, or what Heaven had decreed. But though Beasts be exempt from sin, and that they owe their innocency to their servitude, they are not notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing insensible. All <hi>Philosophers</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge they have inclinations, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions, and that according as objects give against their eyes or ears, they excite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire or fear in their Imaginations. In effect, the nethermost part of our soul hath such correspondency with our senses, as that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62020:65"/>
she borrows her name from them, and is called <hi>sensitive</hi>; insomuch, as it is almost impossible, but that any thing that entreth by those passages, with any contentment or detestation, should cause either pleasure, or pain in the soul. As beasts have these two faculties, which give them feeling and life; we must necessarily conclude, That they have Passions, that they approach to what is good, out of desire, and shun what is evil, out of dislike; that they taste the one with joy, and suffer the other with sorrow. This reason is confirmed by examples; for we see every day how Horses are brought to manage through the fear of punishment, that the Spur quickens their memory, that the noise of Trumpets puts them in good humor, and that very hurts do animate their courage; Bulls fight for glory, and joining craft with strenth, dispute as hotly for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

as by love, they love faithfulness, punish Adultery, and wash this fault in the bloud of the guilty.

                     <p>Truth it self obligeth us to confess, that our advantages are prejudicial to us, and that when very Reason becomes a slave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our senses, it serves only to make our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections more unreasonable.

But men go about to find out casualties before they happen, they seem to have a design to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten their misadvantages, and that to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large Fortunes Empire, they will prevent the evils to which she hath not yet given birth.<note place="margin">Nemo tantum praesentibus miser est. <hi>Sen.

                        </note> That which ought to appease them, incenseth them; and that which is given them to satisfie their hunger, serves often times only to provoke it; so as one may not be said to lie, if he affirm, That man is only ingenuous to his own loss, and that he employs the goodness of his wit, only to make himself more unfortunate, or more faulty: Beasts are stupid, their temperature, which holds of the Earth, makes them insensible, and happily exempts them from all those evils, which hurt not the body, save in as much as they have hurt the Imagination. Bulls must be goad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, to make them furious; and these heavy lumps, whose soul is but a body, do little unirritated. Elephants endure all things at their Masters hands; they think not themselves hurt unless they see their bloud; when the pain is over, their choler
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62020:67"/>
is appeased, and they become as tractable as they were before; but man is of so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate a constitution, as the slightest pain offends him; his blood which is of the the nature of fire, is easily moved, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once moved, it hurries fury throughout all his parts. This fury doth its greatest out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages about the heart; for she furnisheth it with such Spirits, as oftentimes she causeth that to die which gives life to the whole body, and to revenge her self of a particular injury, she hazzards the publick welfare. To compleat this mischief, this Passion is so shy in man, as the least matter is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to provoke it. A word troubleth it, a motion of the head offendeth it, silence sets it going; not finding any thing to entertain it, it devours her own Entrails, and by an excess of despair, turns all her rage against her self.</p>
                     <p>In fine, The life of Beasts being uniform, and nature having given them bounds nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row enough, they have but a few Passions; almost all their motions are caused out of a fear which possesseth them, or a desire wherewith they are affected. But as the life of man is more mingled, and that in the course thereof it is subject to a thousand different inconveniences, his Passions rise
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62020:67"/>
up in a croud; and wheresoever he goes he finds subjects of Choler, and of Fear, of Pleasure, and of Sorrow. Therefore it is, that the Poets have feigned, That his soul passeth into the body of divers Creatures, and that taking all their evil qualities, he uniteth in his person the guile of Serpents, the fury of Tygers, Choler of Lions; teaching us by this Fiction, That man alone hath as many Passions as have all Beasts put together.</p>
                     <p>'Tis therefore that Philosophers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound them unto us for examples, and that the <hi>Stoicks</hi> after having raised our nature to such a height of greatness, are obliged to reduce us to the condition of Beasts, and to place the happiness and rest of their wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in a strange kind of stupidity.<note place="margin">Daemon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They accuse Reason to be the cause of all disorders, they complain of the disadvantages we have by Nature, and would lose both Memory and Wisdom, that they might neither foresee the evils that are to come, nor muse of those that are past. This folly is the punishment of their vanity: Divine Justice hath permitted that understanding which had been their Idol, should become their torment; and that they should every where divulge, That since they could not live like Gods, they were resolved to live like Beasts. But not immediating their despair, we are only to implore aid from Heaven; and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the weakness of Reason, seek out another light to conduct us, and borrow new forces to vanquish our Passions.

There is nothing of greater lustre amongst men than the valour of Conquerors, all O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators would have been mute, had not bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels bin fought, and victories bin had. But to acquire this title of honour, a man must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62020:69"/>
death, forgo pleasures, overcome troubles; and oftentimes purchase Glory by the loss of his own life. After the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Conquerors, there is nothing more illustrious than the eloquence of Orators; she ruleth States without violence, she go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns people without weapons, she works upon their wills with sweetness, she fights, and obtains Victories without blood-shed; but to arrive at this great height, one must overcome a thousand difficulties, accord Art and Nature together, conceive strong thoughts, express them in good words, study the humour of the People, learn the secret of forcing their liberties, and of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their affections. This truth appeareth evidently in the Subject we treat of, and every one confesseth, there is nothing hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er nor yet more honourable, than for a man to overcome his Passions. For to boot that we are not assisted by any others in this conflict; that fortune which rules as chief in all other combats, cannot favour us in this; that men partake not of glory with us, and that we do at once the office of a common Souldier, and of a Commander: there is this of anger and some difficulty in it, that we fight against a part of our selves, that our forces are divided, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62020:69"/>
encourageth us in this war, but duty and integrity. Upon other occasions men are spurred on by honour and envy. Oft times choler, when it hath to do with virtue makes up the greatest part of our valour; hope and boldness assist us; and their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being united, it is almost impossible to be overcome. But when we assail our Passions, our Troops are weakned by divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; we operate but by one part of our selves: let virtue or worth animate our Courage with the best reason she can, our love to our enemies makes us faint-hearted, and we are afraid of a victory, which must cost us the loss of our delights. For though our Passions be irregular, and that they trouble our quiet, these cease not to make up a part of our soul; though their insolency dislike us, we cannot resolve to tear out our bowels, unless we be assisted by Grace; self-love doth betray us, and we spare rebels because they are our Allies. But that which augments the difficulty, and which makes the victory more uncertain, is the power of our enemies; for though they held no intelligence with our soul, though they should not by their cunning, divide her forces, and though she should set upon them with all her might, they are
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62020:70"/>
of such a nature as they may be weakned, and yet not overcome; they may be worst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet not routed; for they are so streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joined with us, as they cannot be parted from us. Their life is bound up with ours, and by a strange fate, they cannot die un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we die with them. So as this victory is never entire, and these Rebels are never so much quelled, but that upon the first oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion they will frame a new Army, and give us battel again. They are <hi>Hydra's,</hi> which thrust up as many heads as are cut off, they are so many <hi>Antaeusses</hi> who gather strength from their weakness, and who rise up the stronger, after they have been beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en down; all the advantage which one can expect upon such unruly subjects, is to clap irons upon their hands and feet, and leave them no more power than what is requisite for the service of Reason. We must treat them as we do Gally-slaves, who draw al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies their iron Chains after them, and who have only the use of their arms to row; or if you will deal with them more favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, you must be well assured of their fidelity, and remember a Maxim which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If the difficulty which accompanieth this combate astonish us, the glory which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues thereupon ought to encourage us; for the Heavens behold nothing of more Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious, nor doth the Earth bear any thing of more glorious, than a man who commands his Passions; No Crown is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to adorn his head, all praises come short of his merit, nothing but Eternity can recompense so exalted a Virtue; the very shadows thereof are pleasing, and the truth thereof is so beautiful, that men adore the semblance. We do not revernce <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> nor <hi>Cato,</hi> but for that they had some tincture thereof, nor do we place them in the number of the Sages, save for that they have triumphed over our weakest Passions. The glory of these great men is purer than that of <hi>Alexander</hi> or <hi>Pompey</hi>; their Victory never made Widow or Orphan, their Conquests have not laid Kingdoms waste, their Combates have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caused the shedding of bloud, nor of tears; and in the gaining of their liberty, they haveneither taken Prisoner, nor made slave; a man reads all their actions with delight, and in all the course of their harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less life, one meets not with any objects of horrour. They are born for the worlds
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62020:71"/>
good, they have laboured for the quiet of all men; there is not any Nation that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignes their happiness, nor which rejoyceth at their death. What honour can a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror hope for, who owes all his greatness to his Injustice? who is only famous for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing criminal; and of whom no mention would have been made in History, had he not slain Men, burnt Towns, ruined Provinces, and dispeopled whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
                     <p>Those who have only warred with their Passions, enjoy a much more real good, and these innocent Conquerors receive more glorious Praises from us. We raise them above all Monarchs; and if they have lived in the Church, we place them in Heaven when they are dead; we take their actions for examples to our selves, we borrow their weapons to fight with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies which they have vanquished, we read their lives, as Conquerors do those of the <hi>Caesars,</hi> we conform our selves to their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and we observe the good Maximes which they have held, the innocent Wiles that they have practised, and the high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs which they have undertaken, that we may obtain like famous Victories. Their most-assured Maximes were, not to trust
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62020:71"/>
their own strength, to implore aid from Heaven, and to hope for more from Grace, than from Nature. If thou wilt overcome (saith Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>) presume not upon thy self,<note place="margin">Si vis vincere, noli de te prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumere, sed illi assigna victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae gloriam qui tibi donat, ut victoriae re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feras palmam. <hi>Aug.</hi> Serm. 2. <hi>De Catechismo.</hi>
                        </note> but give the honour of the victory to him from whom thou expectest the Crown. Their more ordinary wills were to prevent their Passions, to take from them their strength, that they might take their courage from them, to set upon them in their birth, and not to expect till age had made them stronger. Their most memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable enterprizes were to over-run their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies grounds, to consider their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, to mark their designs, and to cut off all Objects that could make them move. These means would succeed happily unto us, if we would make use of them, and we shall not want assistance; since all the Moral Virtues are so many faithful Allies; who fight for our liberty, and which fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish us with Weapons to subdue our Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

                     <head>The THIRD DISCOURSE. That there is no more miserable Slave than he who suffers himself to be guided by his Passions.</head>
                     <p>LIberty is so pleasing, and servitude so irksom, as a man may say with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear of exaggeration, that as the one is the chiefest of all that is good, the other is the chiefest of all that is bad; the people have fought for the preservation of the one, and to defend themselves from the other; nature seems to have perswaded them, 'tis better to die in liberty, than live in servitude. Our Ancestors were so tender in this point, as they could not endure the Roman Authority. They were the last that subjected themselves thereunto, and the first that freed themselves from it. Had not the Heavens made <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> of purpose to conquer them, they had never been slaves to <hi>Rome</hi>; but yet they had this of consolation in their missfortune, that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62020:72"/>
under the conduct of that great <hi>Prince,</hi> 'they revenged themselves of the Republique that had opposed them, and made her suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer servitude, which had made them lose their liberty. Though this evil be so tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the good it deprives us of so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, it is not comparable to that which the tyranny of Passions causeth in us. And it must be granted, that of as many slaves as are in the world, there is none more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, than those who obey such cruel Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</p>
                     <p>For the rest are free in their noblest part,<note place="margin">Corpus est quod dominio fortuna tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, hoc emit, hoc vendit, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior illa pars mancipio dari non potest. <hi>Sen.

But these are slaves even in the bottom of their souls, they cannot dispose either of their thoughts or their desires; they lose in this infamous servitude, that which Captives preserve in Prisons, and that which Tyrants cannot rob their enemies of.</p>
                     <p>The others may quit their Masters, and leaving their Houses, or their Territories,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62020:73"/>
go into places of freedom, where they may breath the air of liberty: But these, though they change Countreys, change not condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they are slaves under Crowns, they serve their Passions, whilst they command their Subjects; and whithersoever they go, they drag their chains after them, and carry their Masters with them. The others long after liberty, and employ their credit to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it: If this fail them, misery opens their understanding, and necessity, which is the mother of Invention, furnisheth them with means to free themselves; but these wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches have so far lost theirs, as they have not so much as retained the desire thereof. They love their servitude, they kiss their Irons, and being strangely blinded, they fear the end of their imprisonment, and dread their deliverance.</p>
                     <p>The others have but one Master, and amongst so many mischiefs which afflict them, they hope to sweeten their captivity, by gaining the favor of him who commands them; they promise unto themselves, that by their assiduous service, they may regain their liberty; they flatter themselves in the thought thereof, and think that a slave who hath but one man to content, cannot be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways unhappy: But these have as many

Sometimes ambition &amp; Love unite their flames to devour them, fear and hope set jointly upon them, sorrow and delight are reconciled together to afflict them, and one may say, that every Master is a Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which torments them, and that every order they receive, is a new punishment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.

                     <p>If servitude be so irksom in ambition, 'tis much more shameful in obscenity. It must be confest, That a man who is possest by this infamous Passion, hath neither Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son nor Liberty, and that being inslaved to Love, he is no more Master of himself.

This unfortunate man lived only at the pleasure of this stranger, he did nothing but by her motions; and never did slave labour so much to win the good will of his Master, as this effeminate Prince, to win the like of his proud Mistress. He gave all his Charges by her directions, and the best part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, groaned under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a woman. He durst not overcome in the batel of <hi>Actium,</hi> and rather chose to forgo his Army than his Love.

from fighting, could not so much as live, if parted from <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> In brief, read the story of all the great ones, and you will find their Passions have enflamed them, and that in the height of their fortune they have made use of all the punishments that tyranny could invent, to afflict those that she oppresseth. Therefore ought all men to make use of Reason and Grace to shun the fury of these insolent Masters, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ought to resolve in his particular, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to lose his life, than his liberty, and to prefer a glorious death before a shameful servitude. But without coming to these extreams in this Combat, a will to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come is sufficient to be victorious; for God hath permitted, that our good fortune de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon our Will together with his Grace; and that our Passions should have no further power over us, than we shall give them, since in effect experience teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us that they beat us not but by our own weapons, and that they make us not their slaves, but by our own consent.</p>

soul, hath its misery, and though it be the less faulty, yet is it the more unfortunate; all that is in it is out of order; the senses are seduced by Objects, these help to abuse Imagination, which excites disorders in the inferior part of the soul, and raiseth Passions, so as they are no longer in that obedience, wherein Original Justice kept them; and though they be subject to the Empire of Reason, yet they so mutinie, as they are not to be brought within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of their duty, but by force or cunning. They are born to obey the understanding, but they easily forget their condition; and the commerce which they hold with the senses, is the cause why they oft-times pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their advises at the commandments of the will. They raise themselves up with such might, as their natural motions are for the most part violent They are horses which have more of fury than of force: They are seas which are oftner troubled than calm.

learn'd, will not find it unjust that the Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be not obedient, unless governed by Reason.</p>
                     <p>To execute so great a design, a man must imitate nature and art, and consider what means they use to finish their work. Nature which doth all by the Elements, and who of these four bodies composeth all others, never employs them till she hath tempered their qualities. As they cannot suffer toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that their natural antipathy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages them to fight: this wise Mother, by allaing their aversions, appeaseth their differences, and never unites them, 'till she hath weakned them. Art, which is not invented so much to perfect nature, as to imitate her, observes the same Rules, and imploys nothing in her workmanship, till it be tempered by her industry. Painting would not be so cried up, had it not found out the secret of reconciling black with white, and so pacifie the natural discord of these two colours, to compose all others thereof. The riders of the great horse have no service from their horses, till they have broke them; and that they may be useful, they must be taught to answer the Bridle and the Spur. Lions were never made use of to draw triumphant Chariots, till they
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62020:77"/>
were tamed; and Elephants bore not Towers upon their backs in fight, till they were rid of the savage humour which they brought from the Woods.</p>
                     <p>All these examples are documents for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the government of our Passions, and Reason ought to imitate nature if she will be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged thereby. They mus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> be employed till moderated; and he who shall think to make them serviceable to virtue, before he hath subjugated them by grace, will ingage himself in a perillous design. In the state of innocency, when they had nothing of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly in them, one might make use of them as they were born; they never surprized the will: As original Justice was as well shed throughout the body, as throughout the soul: The senses made no false reports and their advices being uninteressed, they were always conformable to the judgment of Reason. But now, that all things in man are faulty, that the Body and the Soul are equally corrupted, that the senses are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to a thousand illusions, and that Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination favours their Disorders; we must have great precaution in the use of Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>The first is to consider, what troubles their revolt hath caused in our soul, and in
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62020:78"/>
how many mischiefs these mutiniers have ingaged us, when they have only been led on by our eyes or ears: 'Tis a piece of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to reap advantage by our losses, and to become wise at our own cost. The just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est choler flies out sometimes, if not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by Reason<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> though her motion was lawful in its bir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>, it becomes criminal in the progress thereof. It turns a good cause into a bad one; for not having consulted with the superiour part of the soul; and thinking to punish assight fault, it commits a great one. Fear hath oft-times astonished us, for having only listned to the Senses, she maketh us look pale upon a thousand occasions, without any just cause; and sometimes she hath engaged us in real dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, to make us shun those that were but imaginary. As then our Passions have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived us, for our not having ask'd counsel of our Reason, we must resolve never to believe them any more, till we have exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, whether that which they desire, or that which they fear, be reasonable, and whether the understanding, which sees fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than our eyes, cannot discover the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of our hopes or fears.</p>
                     <p>The second precaution, is, to oblige Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to watch alwaies over such subjects as
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62020:78"/>
may excite our Passions, and to consider their nature, and motions, to the end that she may never be surprized. Harms foreseen hurt but a little, and we are but seldom asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished at such accidents, against which we are prepared. A Pilot who sees a storm com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, withdraws into the Haven; or if he be too far from it, he lanch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>th into the deep, and keeps aloof from Coasts, or Rocks. A Father who knows that his Children are mortal, and that life hath no longer term than what it hath pleased God to give, will never take on too much at their loss. A Prince who considers, that victory depends more upon Fortune than his Wisdom, and more on Chances than on the Valour of his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, will easily be comforted though he hath been beaten: But we make not use of our understanding, &amp; methinks, if our Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be out of order, Reason ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused thereof, for not having foreseen the danger, and for not having prepared our senses against their surprizals.</p>
                     <p>The third precaution is, to study the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of such Passions, as we take in hand to moderate or govern. For some must be rudely dealt withal, and to reduce them to their duty, severity and violence must be made use of; others will be flattered, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62020:79"/>
they must be gently dealt withal to make them obedient to Reason. Though they be subjects, they are not slaves, and the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing which governs them, is rather their Father than their Soveraign. Others would be cozened, and though Virtue be so generous, she is tied to accommodate herself to the weakness of Passions, and to make use of wiles, when force will not prevail. Love is of this nature, we must divert it, not being able to banish it from out of our hearts, we must lay before it le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate Objects, and make it virtuous by an innocent cozenage: Choler would be flattered, and who thinks to oppose this torrent by making a Dam, hath but aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented its Fury. Fear and Sorrow ought to be rudely dealt withal; and of these two Passions, the former is so faint-hearted, as it is not to be overcome but by force; and the second is opinionated, as it is not to be brought within rule, but by provocation. These means being well observed, the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of our soul may be sweetned. These savage Beasts become domestick, when they have lost their natural fierceness; Reason makes good use of them, and Virtue shapes no design which she executes without their mediation.</p>

                     <head>The FOURTH DISCOURSE. That in what condition soever our pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions be, they may be governed by Reason.</head>
                     <p>THough Nature be so liberal, she ceaseth not to be a good housewife, and to employ with profit that which she hath abundantly produced; all her parts have their use, and amongst the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of Creatures which do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the world, there is not any one which hath not its use. Those which do us no ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, contribute to our pleasures; the most beautiful, and most delightful serve to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn the world, and the very deformed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain her variety.</p>
                     <p>As shadows set off colours, ugliness gives a lustre to Beauty; and Monsters which are the defect of Nature, make her chiefest works and miracles be esteemed. There is nothing more pernicious than poison; and were not sin barren, one would
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62020:80"/>
take it for one of its production, since it seems to agree with the other, to make all men die. Yet hath it its use; Physick makes Antidotes thereof, and there are certain sicknesses which cannot be cured but by prepared poisons; use hath turned them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nourishment. And if there have been Princes whom poison could not kill, Beasts who bear it about in their bodies, cannot live without it; that which is pernicious to us, is so necessary to them, as they cannot be berest of it without loss of life. This is that which makes all <hi>Philosophers</hi> grant with Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Si Scorpionis venenum ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum esset, prius scorpionem perimeret; ac contra si ei ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quo modo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trahatur, fine dubitatione in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriret, ergo il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius corpori malum est a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittere quod nostro malum est recipere, &amp; illi bonum est habere id quo nobis bonum est cavere. <hi>Aug.</hi> l. <hi>De Moribus,</hi> c. 8.</note> that venom is no evil, since it is natural to Scorpíons and Vipers, and that they die when they lose it, as we do when we take it.</p>
                     <p>If our Adversaries would have the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Soul; to pass for poisons, or mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; this Reason will enforce them to confess, that they are not so absolutely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, but that they may be prepared as well as poisons, and Antidotes made thereof to cure our Maladies; or to continue our health. For consider them how you please, and give them what countenance you like best to make them hideous: Reason will alwayes find a way to make use of them: and this great Steward of our good and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62020:80"/>
bad, can so wisely husband them, that in despight of sin, which hath disordered them, she will draw advantage and glory from them.</p>
                     <p>If we look upon them in their birth, they are tractable affections, and but of weak resistance, and which by a little instruction become docile and obedient. They are children which are afrighted with words, and who for fear of a small punishment, amend their evil inclinations, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage their masters councils. They are young grafts, which an ill wind hath made crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but which are easily set aright with a little care, and which not being yet become inflexible, will be bowed contrary to their natural inclination. Neither would the <hi>Platonists</hi> have the name of the Passions given to these disorders in their birth; and knowing, that they were easily governed, they were contented to call them affections, without giving them a more injurious ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</p>
                     <p>If we consider them when they are grown older, when making use of our weakness, they have gotten new forces, and of simple Affections are become violent Passions; we must treat them in order to their proper interests, and feeding them
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62020:81"/>
with hope of pleasure or glory, draw them to what is good, and divert them from evil. For in their greatest revolt, they reserve always an inclination to virtue, and an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrition to sin; they are only faulty as they are abused: Take away the Fillet where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with their eyes are blinded, and that will suffice to redress their motions, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their errors. Sin hath not been able so far to dishonour Nature, but that she hath always kept the grounds of her inclinations; she always loves what is good, and hateth evil eternally; she pursues glory, and shuns infamy; she wisheth pleasure, and fears pain; all her motions are as natural as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. The Devil, who very well sees this disorder, is pernicious to his designs; and that this impression, which is set on by the hand of God, cannot be defaced, changeth our Passions; and not being able to corrupt them, he endeavoureth to abuse them; he propounds unto them appearing good, for what is real; he disguis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>h sin, and puts upon it the Cloak of Virtue. And as thus hoodwink'd they cannot discern falshood from truth, they confound evil with good, and by a deplorable misfortune, they love what they ought to hate, and hate what they ought to love. Their cure consists in
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62020:81"/>
disabusing them; for how firmly soever they be tied to these disguised objects, they will flie from them as soon as they shall be made to know what is beautiful, and what is ill favoured; and following their first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, they will abhor their blindness, and will forgo the appearing good to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the true one. We ought to comfort our selves in our misfortune, since that the nature of Passions is not altogether chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; that since the disobedience of our Forefathers, and the hatred of his enemy, they retain notwithstanding some purity; and that in all their disorder, there is more of errour, than of malice.</p>
                     <p>If in fine, we consider them in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream violence, and in the condition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they throw about so much smoke and flame, as they darken Reason, and force her to give over the government of them, 'tis hard to make good use of them; for they seem to have changed condition, as having sided with sin, they deserve to carry her name, and rather to be termed troubles and commotions than Passions. They are so insolent, as they despise all counsel; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of taking law from the understanding, they will give it; and of natural subjects, become insupportable Tyrants. When the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62020:82"/>
mischief is risen to this height, 'tis very hard to remedy it; and one may be said to have made all desperate, through too long expectation; for Passions will listen no longer, and Reason is so troubled, as she can prescribe them no further rules; the waves rise up even unto Heaven; that part of man which ought always to be at quiet, is engaged in the storm, and had need of others help to appease the troubles she is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated withal. Truly I do not believe, any Philosopher dare undertake to cure a man in this phrensie; remedies will make his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady the worse: There is nothing but time that can lessen it; and it is to be wish'd for, that this torrent may find room enough wherein to extend in waters, and to dissipate the fury thereof. But when this tempest is appeased, when the Passions are a little cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and when reason hath gotten a little light and strength, the evilness of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition must be laid before him; he must be made blush for his offence, and these slavish rebels must be roundly chid; but above all, he must humble himself before God, enrich himself by his Losses, and become wise at his cost.

and debauch his subjects; thus we shall be bettered by our greatest misfortunes: We shall learn by experience, that storms may bring into the Haven; and that if there be some ways that drown men, there are some which throw them upon the Bank: But as there is no Sailor, who will run this hazard, to oblige the Heavens to do a miracle in his behalf, no man ought to expose himself to this disorder, that he may reap profits thereby; and it is better to want an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain good, than to buy it by an assured loss.</p>
                     <p>In consideration of these truths, we may affirm our condition is not so deplorable as those imagine it to be, who will excuse their sin upon their misery: Since our good fortune is in our own power, and that we sail upon a Sea, the calm or tempest where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, depends upon our will; we may shun the Rocks the Sea hides, asswage the fury of the winds which make it go high, bring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>AMongst many other means, which Reason may make use of to govern our Passions, the most ordinary seem to be those, which she hath learn'd from hunting, where men make use of beasts already tamed to take wild ones; and where to sport themselves, they use the courage of Dogs, against the rage of Wolves.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62020:83"/>
vanquish those which yet war against us. Men oppose joy to sorrow, suppress fear by hope, moderate delights by the pain which ensues thereupon. Sometimes also men consider such Passions as produce others. To drain Rivers, men endeavour to dry up the spring heads from whence they derive; and to destroy causes that they may ruine their effects.<note place="margin">D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sometimes also a man may set upon that particular Passion which bears most sway with him, that he may vanquish those that fight under the others Colours, and the Victory is had by one Blow; by the Generals death the whole Army is defeated. But though all these be specious means, and that they promise unto us, either a sound peace or a long Truce, yet are they Deceivers, and make us undertake things either unjust, impossible; or dangerous. For there is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in fortifying one enemy to destroy ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and there is no great assurance in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing a Passion with weapons, which may as well make use of them to oppose Reason, as in her behalf. 'Tis unjust to oppose the

                        </gap> weakned. In fine, to endeavour to choak one Passion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to overcome the rest which proceed from thence, is to attempt an impossibility: they may well be moderated, not destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; they proceed from the union of our soul with our body; and to take away their life, the like must be done to man who produceth them. Our Passions are much more intimate to us than are our members; a man may cut off these when they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, he cannot cut off the others when they are disobedient. Also the greatest part of these advices are given us by suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed persons; these bad Reasons come from the <hi>Stoicks</hi> school, who look upon Passions as enemies to our quiet, and who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour not to regulate, but to annihilate them. They are perswaded it fares with them, as with savage Beasts, which are never so well tamed, but that they always
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62020:84"/>
preserve somewhat of their first fierceness, and that to reduce the soul into perfect tranquility, they ought not to be allayed, but destroyed.</p>
                     <p>To resolve these difficulties, we must remember that Reason is King over Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; that their Government is one of her chief employments, and that she is bound to watch more particularly over those which by their motions carry others along with them: For as their revolt is followed by an universal Rebellion, their Obedience seems likewise to cause a general peace, and that they never acknowledge Reason, but when they reduce together with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, all those Passions which they had rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up.</p>
                     <p>One may very well sometimes oppose pleasure to grief, hope to fear, and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to aversion, but in this combate Reason must take heed, lest by weakning one Passion, she add too much strength unto another; and that whilst she would reduce a Mutinier to obedience, she do not augment the number of Rebels. When she undertakes these affairs, she must hold the Scales in her hand; and remember that God (whom she imitateth) doth all his Works by weight and measure; and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:62020:85"/>
when he tempers the qualities of the Elements, to the end that he may agree them, he doth no advantage to one whereby another is prejudiced. We may likewise well assail the Passion that masters us, and which we acknowledge to be the cause of our disorders: For it is a Familiar which possesseth us; 'tis a Tyrant which useth not his power, save in order to his own interest; and who is so much the more dangerous, as that he endeavours to become welcom. Reason is bound to oppugne him as a publick Enemy, and to employ all her might, if not to destroy him, at least to weaken him.</p>
                     <p>I see not notwithstanding how she can with security make use of other Passions to tame him; for they are too near allied unto him, to set upon him; and when men shall think to make use of them to his destruction, he will have dexterity enough to make them serve for his own preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>But not to leave so dangerous an evil without a remedy, I should think it good to cut off the objects which nourish it, and to get the upper hand of an enemy, by starving him, whom he could not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62020:85"/>
come by force. For though our Passions are born with us, that they borrow their strength from our constitution; and that those which are the most natural, are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to overcome; yet they draw their nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment from exterior things; and if they be not entertained by Objects, they either die or pine away.</p>
                     <p>Ambition doth not greatly torment us in solitude; and when she sees not the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Towns, the pride of Buildings, the pomp of Triumphs, she forgets the memory of glory; and this fire not having wherewithal longer to nourish it, consumes and goes out of it self: Grief and sadness are strengthened in darkness; her obscure Chambers hung with mourning, conspire with her to afflict us.</p>
                     <p>Men who make use thereof, seem to be afraid to forget their sorrow; and that they would have all things they cast their eye upon, to call to mind their loss: If we put these sad Objects far from us, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will grow weary of weeping; and though she be irregular, by reason of sin, she will solace her self when she shall see nothing which entertains her dislike.</p>

She promiseth to change men into Angels, to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62020:87"/>
raise them above a mortal condition, and to put storms and thunder under their feet. She boasts to cure them of all their evils, and to free them from those vexatious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, which molest the Souls tranquility: all those fair promises have brought forth none effects, and these proud billows, after having made such noise, are turned to foam. Certainly we owe thanks to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which hath rendered their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors vain; for if they had made good their words, they had deprived us of all those aids which nature hath endowed us withal, to make us virtuous; and the inferior part of our soul hath remained without either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise or merit;<note place="margin">Affectiones nostrae motus animorum sunt laetitia animi diffusio, tristitia animi contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio, cupiditas animi progres sio: Diffunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris enim animo cum laetaris, contraheris a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimo cum mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestaris, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grederis animo cum appetis, fugis animo cum metuis. <hi>Aug. super Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi> Scim. 5.</note> for the passions are the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof, they carry her whither she mindeth to go, and without loosning her from her body, they join her to the Objects which she looks after, or keep her aloof from those she desires to shun. Joy is her blooming and displaying, sorrow is her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction and pain, desire is her seeking, and fear her eschewing; for when we are merry, our soul dilates it self, when afflicted, she contracts her self, when we desire, she seems to advance, and when we fear, she seems to retire, insomuch, as those who will take the Passions from the soul, take away all her
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62020:87"/>
motions, and under colour of rendring her happy, make her unprofitable and unable. I know no rational man that would purchase felicity at so dear a rate, and I know no true man that would promise it upon so hard a condition: For if happiness consist in action, and if to be content, a man must taste the good which he possesseth, there is none but will avow, That Passions are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to our soul, and that joy must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Felicity which desire hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.</p>
                     <p>Those who side with the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> will tell us peradventure, That these Philosophers condemn not such desires as arise from the love of virtue, nor the joy that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the fruition thereof; but that they blame only those irregular wishes, that we make every day for Riches and Honour; and that consequently they blame the vain contentment which their accomplishment brings us.</p>
                     <p>This answer weakens their Maximes, and confirms ours; for it admitteth of Passions, and only forbids their excess: It admits of desires and hopes, and only rejects their disorder; and to end all in few words, It healeth the malady of our affections, and doth not destroy their nature. But the <hi>Stoicks</hi>
                        <pb n="126" facs="tcp:62020:88"/>
were not so just, and their Philosophy had in it so much of severity, and so little of reason, as it would have a man seek out virtue, without wishing for it, possess it without relishing it, and that being as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as God himself, he should be void of desire, hope or joy. In brief, it had vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the death of our Passions, and yet this proud Sect did not consider, that in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying them, they caused the death of all Virtues; for they are the seeds thereof, and by taking a little pain in trimming and pruning of them, they may be made advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to us.</p>

                        <note place="margin">In optimo quoque ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam erudias, virtutis mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria non virtus est, <hi>Sen.

That as science (according to the <hi>Platonicks</hi>) is but a remembrance, or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to mind; her good habits are but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inclinations. For all his Passions are budding Virtues, and if he take a little care to perfect them, they become compleat Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues: Is not fear which foresees evil and shunneth it, natural wisdom? Is not Choler, which takes up arms in the behalf of good
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62020:88"/>
against the enemy thereof, a shadow of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice? Is not Desire which serves us from our selves, to join us with somewhat that is better, an Image of Charity, which takes us from the Earth to raise us up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? What must be added to Boldness, to make thereof true Fortitude? And what difference is there between Sorrow and Repentance, save only that the one is the meer workmanship of Nature, and the other the production of Grace? but both of them are afflicted with evil, and they oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times mingle their tears to bewail the same sin.</p>
                     <p>In fine, There are no Passions which may not become Virtues; and as they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations to what is good, and aversions from what is evil, they need but a little Government to make them change Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>The good Application of a mans Love is sufficient to make all his Passions inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; and without taking so much pain to love aright, is only requisite to make us happy in this world. Since Virtue (faith St. <hi>Augustine</hi>) is the habit of a well governed mind, we are but to moderate our Affections, that they may be changed into Virtues; for when
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62020:89"/>
our hatred and our love,<note place="margin">Quoniam vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus est habitus mentis bene composita, componendi, instituendi, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ordinandi sunt animi af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus ad id quod debent, ut in virtutes proficere pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sint: Cum er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go prudenter, modeste, forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; juste a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor &amp; odium instituuntur, in virtutes exur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt, scilicet, prudentiam, temperantiam, fortitudinem &amp; justitiam, <hi>Aug.</hi> lib. <hi>De Spiritu &amp; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima,</hi> c. 1.</note> which are the Spring-heads of all other Passions, shall be wisely, modestly, strongly, and justly guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they will become rare Virtues, and will be converted into wisdom, temperance, fortitude, and justice. Is it not then a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous thing, to go about to strangle Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, which have such affinity with Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and which without much labour may be raised to so noble a Condition? Is it not ingratitude to mistake the advantages which we have received from Nature? and is it not injustice to give infamous names to these innocent Subjects, which being well managed by Reason, might merit such glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Titles?</p>
                     <p>'Tis then an indubitable Maxim amongst the Philosophers, That Passions are the seed of Virtues, and that they have no more noble employment, than to arm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their behalf, to fight their quarrels, and to revenge them of their enemies. As mothers are never more couragious, than in the defence of their children; the affections of our soul are never more vigorous, than when they defend their products against Vices. This praise puzzles the brains of all the <hi>Stoicks.</hi> And <hi>Seneca</hi> could not endure that Virtues Army should be composed of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62020:89"/>
souldiers that could mutinie; he will not have us employ Passions in her service, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some few have been found which have injured her authority. Certainly if all Princes were so obdurate as is this <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher,</hi> they would find few souldiers, and they must cashier all their troops, because formerly they have found some of them unfaithful. The negligence of Princes is oft-times cause why the souldiers muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and the weakness of Reason is almost alwayes the cause of the revolt of Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>In true <hi>Philosophy</hi> the soul must be rather accused than the body, and the Soveraign rather blamed than the Subjects. Who sees not that fear is watchful for virtue, that she always mingles her self as a Spy amongst the enemies, to find out their designs; that all her reports are faithful, and that we are for the most part unhappy only for having neglected them? who knows not that hope strengthens us, and that she encourageth us to the understanding of glorious and difficult designs? who doth not confess that Boldness and Choler despise danger, suffering hardness, and setting even upon death, that they may be serviceable to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Fortitude? what virtues would
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62020:90"/>
not become weak, were they abandoned by Passions; how oft hath the fear of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy infused courage into souldiers who were seeking how shamefully to run away? how oft hath shamefastness preserved Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity, and kept both maids and married wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men within their duty, when avarice and wantonness hath endeavoured to corrupt them? how oft hath indignation encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Judges against the guilty, who were made insolent in their misdemeanor, by the protection of great ones?</p>
                     <p>Let the <hi>Stoicks</hi> then confess, that virtues owe their welfare to Passions; and let them not tell us any more that they are too gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to implore aid from their slaves. But let us tell them, they are too full of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, to despise such faithful friends; and that they will never make a difficulty in accepting them for their allies, when ever they will assail the common enemy, Vice. I had rather follow <hi>Aristotles</hi> opinion than <hi>Seneca</hi>'s, and rather govern Passions than destroy them. This man out of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive pride will not have Virtue to stand in need of any thing; and that the wise man who is thereof possest, way be happy, even contrary to the will of God himself; he will have his happiness to be so firmly

grounded, that the Heavens cannot over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn it; and to judge by his words, it seems that insolency and impiety are the first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite dispositions for the acquiring of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; the other on the contrary acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth his weakness, useth such help as nature hath afforded him; and knowing very well that he is composed of a Soul and Body, he endeavoureth to employ them both in the exercise of virtue.<note place="margin">Ira necessaria est, nec quid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam sine illa expugnari po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, nisi illa impleat ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum, &amp; spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum attendat. <hi>Arist. in Senec.</hi> l. 1. <hi>De Ira,</hi> c. 9.</note> He confesseth we cannot undertake any thing of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, unless chafed by choler, and that we faint and droop when we are not irritated.

But that we may not be mistaken in so important a Subject, and whereupon our happiness seemeth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, we must know that Passions are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good nor bad, and that (to speak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly) these two qualities are only found in the superior power which governs them. As that is only free, it is only good or evil, and as it is the Original of merit, it is also the Spring-head either of wickedness or goodness.

For we are now no longer in that happy estate of innocency, where the Passions expected their orders only from Reason, and where they never raised themselves, till they had obtained leave; they are become disloyal, and no longer acknowledging the voice of their Soveraign, they obey that first that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them, and take part assoon with a Tyrant as with their legitimate Prince. This error whereinto they often fall, obligeth us to confess, that they are not much less inclinable to vice than to virtue; and that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62020:92"/>
if we may hope for great advantages by them, we ought also to fear notable mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs from them. For the same desires which raise us up to Heaven, fasten us to the earth; that which nature hath given us to set us at liberty, casts us in prison, and claps Bolts upon us. The same hope which flatters us, abuseth us; and that which ought to sweeten our past misfortunes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth us new ones; the same choler which bringeth the couragious to the combate, animates the faint-hearted to revenge, and what is generous in war, becomes cruel in peace.</p>
                     <p>In fine, Passions are not farther distant from vices than they are from virtue, as in the confusion of the <hi>Chaos</hi> fire was mingled with water, so is evil mingled with good in the affections of the soul; and from those fatal Mines, Iron is, as well drawn out as Gold; man ought therefore to keep himself always upon his guard, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he carrieth about in his bosom both life and death, it behoveth him to be as circumspect in his comportments, as those who handle poyson, or who walk upon the edge of a Precipice.</p>
                     <p>But that which makes the danger the greater, is, that when these unruly Passions
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62020:92"/>
have brought forth a vice, they put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in arms to defend it, and serve it with more courage, than do the innocent Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons obey virtue. They are servants which are more cruel than are their Masters; Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers which are more furious than the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants that set them on work; and they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit more of outrage upon Virtue, than doth Vice it self. All wars are occasioned by these insolent Affections, and he who shall banish love and hatred from off the earth, will find neither Murder nor Adultery there. They furnish the subject of all Tragedies; and though men accuse Poets of Fictions, they have committed more Errors than the others have invented. But they are never more prejudicial than when they meet in the person of a Prince, and when they abuse Soveraign power, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise their fury; for then whole States groan under their tyranny, the people are opprest by their violence, and all parts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that neither the Plague nor the Sword are so pernicious, as are Passions when they have got the supream power.</p>
                     <p>An unlawful love put all <hi>Greece</hi> in Arms; and the flames thereof reduced the goodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est City of all <hi>Asia</hi> to Ashes. Jealousie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> was the loss of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62020:93"/>
the lives of more than a million of men; the world was divided in their quarrel, their ambition put arms into the hands of all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; their unjust war was the ruine of their Country, and the loss of the liberty thereof. the world doth yet bemoan this disaster; the spoils of this shipwrack are yet seen; and the States of <hi>Europe</hi> are but so many pieces which did compose the Body of that puissant Republique. Ambition when confounded with virtue, is guilty of more murders than Revenge and Choler; though this passion pretend to be generous, she is always stained with blood; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever delight she takes in pardoning, her greatness is grounded upon the ruine of her enemies; she is cause of more deaths than she procureth pardons; and she is the loss of more innocents, than safety of those that are guilty. She astonisheth all the world, when she is seen in the person of an <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> And it seems Nature produced him to no other end, than to teach us what am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition can do, when assisted by fortune. He ruined all Princes who would defend their own States; he treated those as Enemies who refused to be his Subjects; he could not permit an equal in any place through which he passed: He complained of the Seas that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62020:93"/>
stopt the current of his victories, and wisht for a new world, that he might conquer it; If his vain-glory caused so many disorders, his Choler committed no less ransack; and if by the one he revenged himself of his Enemies, he rid his hands of his Friends by the other; the least suspitions encouraged these passions to revenge, one indiscreet word provoked it; an honest freedom set it a going, and his Choler grew to be so nice, as there was as much danger in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well, as in saying ill; As he was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed by all these violences, so did he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey them; he dipped his hands in the bloud of his Favourites; he took upon him the office of a Hangman; and that he might taste all the pleasures of revenge, he himself would be the Minister thereof, and with his own hands kill him who had saved his life.</p>
                     <p>But amongst all the cruelties whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Choler oft did perswade him, I know none more infamous than that which he exercised upon Innocent <hi>Calisthenes,</hi> his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was a Sanctuary to him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing Phylosophy, it seemed he ought not fear the fury of <hi>Alexander</hi>; the very fault for which he was condemed, was glorious; and had it happened in the time
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62020:94"/>
of true Religion, it would have passed for an eminent virtue; for he defended the cause of his gods, and was of opinion that Temples could not be built to his Prince without provoking the gods against him; he guided himself so dexterously in so ticklish a business, as that whilst he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the honour of Heaven, he flattered <hi>Alexanders</hi> humour,<note place="margin">Intervallo opus est ut quis cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datur Deus, semper<expan>

                     <head>The THIRD DISCOURSE. That there are no Passions which may not be changed into Virtues.</head>
                     <p>VVE have said in our former discourses, that Passions are the seeds of Virtues, &amp; that by having a care of husbanding them well,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62020:95"/>
their effects were very advantageous to us. But proceeding on further, my intention is in this discourse, to teach Christians the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, how they may change them into Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and to take from them whatsoever they have of savage or monstrous. This Metamorphosis is certainly very hard, but not impossible; and if we advise with nature, she will furnish us with inventions; for this wise Mother is continually working of strange alterations.</p>
                     <p>Her power never appears to be greater, than when she alters the Elements, or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals; and when she takes from them their former qualities, that she may give them others more excellent, and more noble. But she observes therein an admirable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, which well deserves consideration; for though she be all-powerful, and that holding the place of God, she may act as a Soveraign, and do what she pleaseth with the Elements or Metals, yet doth she never use violence; and she seemeth rather to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate her self to their interests, than to her own inclinations; she observeth their sympathies, and worketh no alteration which is not agreeable unto them.</p>
                     <p>Thus we see she ratifies air, to change it into fire, and conduceth water to turn
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62020:96"/>
it into earth; thus we observe she purifies silver, to give it the tincture of Gold, and labours whole ages to finish without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence this useful Metamorphosis.</p>
                     <p>Now as Morality is an imitation of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, her chief care ought to be employed in observing the proprieties of our Passions, and in converting them into virtues which are not contrary unto them; for he that would go about to change Choler into Mildness, or fear into generousness, would endeavour an impossibility, and would have ill success in all his labours; but that his designes may succeed well, he must study the nature of every Passion, and use all his means to turn each passion into such a virtue as it hath least aversion unto; and this ought not to seem strange, since the most rational of all men hath been of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that in the opposition which Nature hath placed between vice and virtue, they had notwithstanding somewhat of resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance one with the other; for all men will confess, that prodigality hath more relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to liberality than avarice; and that it is not hard to reduce a prodigal man to be a liberal man; every one is bound to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that Rashness sides more with Courage than with Cowardice, and that it is
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62020:96"/>
easier to make a rash man, than a Coward, couragious.</p>
                     <p>Therefore do Philosophers agree, that of the two extreams which do environ vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, one of them is alwaies more favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto her; and a little care being had will easily take her part, and defend her interest.</p>
                     <p>Following the same Maxime, we must confess that there are some passions which have more of affinity with some virtues, than with some others, and which by the help of Morality, may easily become vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
                     <p>That fear which foresees dangers,<note place="margin">Metuamus er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go ut non me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuamus, hoc est prudenter me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuamus, ne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amter metua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, <hi>Aug.</hi> Ser. 15. <hi>De Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyribus.</hi>
                        </note> which laboureth how to shun them, which looks far into what is to come, that it may find a remedy, may easily be changed into wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, provided the distraction which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companieth it, and which doth most commonly abuse us in our deliberations, be taken away. That hope which makes us taste a good which we do not yet enjoy, which comforteth us in our misfortunes, and which through our present evils shews us a future happiness, may easily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into that virtue which we call Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. That Choler which punisheth faults, and arms us to revenge our friends
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62020:97"/>
injuries, differs not far from Justice; for provided it be not too violent, and that the self interests thereof leave it light enough to guide it self, it will wage war with all the wicked, and take all that are innocent into its protection.</p>
                     <p>That boldness which encourageth us to the combate, which gives assurance in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and which makes us prefer a glorious death before a shameful retreat, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come exact Valour; if we suppress its incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to fury, and if we mingle a little light with the too much heat thereof. Love and Hatred, Desire and Eschewing, are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Virtues, than Passions, when governed by Reason. Provided they love nothing but what is lovely, and hate nothing but what is hateful, they deserve praise rather than reproach.</p>
                     <p>Sadness and Despair, Jealousie and Envy, are indeed more cried down; they seem to be enemies to our quiet, that the Heavens have made them Ministers of their Justice, and that they supply the places of those revengeful Furies which Poets feign to punish the faulty. Yet may they be useful to Reason, if well managed, and under those hideous faces wherein they appear, they hide good meanings, which
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62020:97"/>
are of use to virtue. A good emulation may be framed out of a well-regulated En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy. Discreet zeal may be shaped out of moderated Jealousie; without which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prophane nor sacred yet love under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes any thing of Generous. Sorrow hath so many praises given her in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as it is easie to judge, that if she be not amongst the number of the virtues, she may be advantageously made use of to their service. <note place="margin">Melior est tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitia iniqua parientis, quam laetitia iniqua facientis. <hi>Aug.</hi> lib. <hi>De vera In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentia.</hi>
                        </note> She loosens us from the earth; and by a despising all the contentments of the world, she makes us thirst after eternal delights; she appeaseth Gods anger; she furnisheth us with tears, wherewithal to wash away our sins and to water his Altars; She is always a faithful companion to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; and no sin in Christian Religion was ever forgiven, before Sorrow and Repentance had obtained pardon. Despair hath but the name of terrible; but who shall well consider her effects,<note place="margin">Ratio terro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem prudenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus excutit: In peritis fit magna ex de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speratione se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitas. <hi>Senec.</hi> quaest. nat. l. 6. c. 2.</note> will avow 'tis a wise invention of nature which cures the greatest part of our maladies, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away from us the hope of remedy; for then we make virtue of necessity, we draw force from our weakness; we turn our fear into fury, and our desires into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; we set upon enemies whose approach
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62020:98"/>
we dare not expect; and we misprize ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which we cannot abandon. Thus shall we find many men who owe their quiet more to Despair, than to hope; and who shall well examine the humour of these two Affections, will be forced to acknowledge, that the one makes us miserable by her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, the other happy by her refusals; that the one nourisheth our desires, the other causeth them to die; that the one cozeneth us, and the other disabuseth us; that we are lost by the flatteries of the one, and saved by the others affliction. This is the Reason why the greatest Poet in the world hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that Despair is that which raiseth up the Courage of the conquered, and which restores unto them the Victory which Hope and Rashness had berest them of.</p>
                     <p>But whatever advantage I attribute to these Passions, I confess they have their errors, and that to make them virtuous, they must be carefully cleansed. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause so profitable an affair cannot be too often treated of, I shall willingly observe their chiefest enormities; to the end that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerning them, as in a Looking-glass, every one may be careful how to eface them. Take blindness from love, and he will be no more faulty; for it is permitted to love such
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62020:98"/>
subjects as deserve love,<note place="margin">Amor est mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus cordis, qui cum se inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate mov t, id est, ad ea quae non debet, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piditas dicitur; cum vero or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinatus est, charitas appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latur. <hi>Aug.</hi> lib. <hi>De Substantia Electionis,</hi> c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Exempt errour from hatred, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred will become consonant to Reason; for it is not just to confound the sinner with his sin; and who can make this distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may boast to hate with justice; desire and eschewing are innocent, provided they be moderated; joy and sorrow are only blameable in their excess; and the same Reason which permits us to taste with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure a good which we wish for, doth not forbid us sorrowing for an evil which we apprehend. Hope is only then unjust, when she measureth not her forces; and despair is only then faulty, when it takes its rise ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from our remissness, than from our weakness. Boldness is then praise-worthy, when it grapples with a danger which it may overcome; and fear is wisdom, when it shuns a danger it cannot overcome. Choler is an act of justice, when born against sin, and provided it be not judge in its own cause, it pronounceth none but lawful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees. Envy is generous, provided it excite us unto virtue, and that it lay before us the good qualities of our neighbour, only so far forth as that we may imitate
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:62020:99"/>
them. Jealousie is only hateful, because it hath in it too much of love; yet this fault is pardonable when not accompanied with suspition, and if the beloved cannot cure it, they are bound to endure it. But to put an end to this discourse with S. <hi>Augustine</hi>; Christians make good use of their Passions,<note place="margin">Metuunt enim poenam aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, cupiunt vitam aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, dolent in re quia adhuc ingemescunt adoptionem fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorum Dei, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectantes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demptionem corporis sui; gaudent in spe, quia mors ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorbebitur in victoriam. <hi>Aug.</hi> l. 14. <hi>De Civ.

Their fears correspond with Reason, when they consider Gods judgments, and the punishment of the damned; their desire is just when they aim at the happiness of the blessed. Their sorrow is harmless when they afflict themselves for all the evils which our first Father hath left us to inherit, and when opprest with grief, they sigh after the liberty of the children of God. Their joy is a holy joy when they expect the fruition of the good which is prepared for them, and when by a firm hope they already taste the effects of their Masters promises. <note place="margin">Metuunt pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care, cupiunt perseverare, dolent in pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catis, gaudent in operibus bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <head>The FOURTH DISCOURSE. That the government of Passions is vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues chief employment.</head>
                     <p>MAn is brought into so happy a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition by sin, as his very advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges reproach his misery unto him, and he is made to know his faultiness by what is most excellent in him. Those no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble qualities which beautifie his soul, and which restore unto him the glory which he had lost, have but unpleasing employments, and are engaged in combats, which though they be difficult, cease not to be shameful. For mans most illustrious virtues, have no other employment than to make war upon vice, and the necessity he hath to make use thereof is one of the chiefest proofs of the irregularity of his nature. Prudence which serves him for a guide, advertiseth him that he walketh in darkness, and that he is in an enemies Country. Fortitude teacheth him that he ought to fight, &amp; that
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62020:100"/>
in all the course of his life he tastes no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure which is not mingled with pain; tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance gives him to understand, that his constitution is out of order, and that he hath delights which flatter him only, that they may destroy him.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, Justice obligeth him to believe, that not any thing which he possesseth is his, and that having a Soveraign who hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him all that he enjoyeth, he is only the Steward to distribute them. These vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues do what they say, their employments answer their counsels; they act not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out going about to stifle some disorder, and to overcome some vicious inclinations. Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence chuseth the Arms and the Enemy; temperance rejects pleasure; fortitude sets upon sorrow; justice sits President in all these combates; she takes care that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror be not insolent in his victory; that the Soul take not such advantage over the Body, that in thinking to tame it, it destroy it, and that whilst it would revenge it self of a disobedient Vassal, it lose not a faithful friend. So as we must conclude, that the exercise of Virtue is a continual warfare against Vice. And that these glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious qualities have no more noble em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment than to charge upon Monsters,

                     <p>'Tis therefore that Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> with all the Divines, do acknowledge that they were only given us to assist us during this miserable life, and that they are steps whereby to arrive at that height of felicity which consists in the enjoyment of the <hi>Summum bonum.</hi> For then our Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will be no more necessary, since we shall have no evils to shun; our Justice will then be superfluous, for we shall pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess all our riches in common.

Now amongst a thousand different employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which the virtues have here below, one of the most advantageous is the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Passions. For it seems nature hath destined them to tame these savage subjects, and so reduce them under the Empire of Reason. Some have dexterity to win them, others strength to beat them down; some use threats to astonish them, others promises to allure them, and all of them together use se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral means to arrive at the end.</p>
                     <p>Prudence never comes to handy-blows, but as she is the Queen of Moral Virtues, she contents her self with giving Orders, with providing for our souls peace, with stifling seditions in their birth, and with suppressing unruly motions which threaten her with an intestine war. If the match be already made, she endevours to break it by her dexterity, and not medling in the fight, she opposeth to every Passion that Virtue which is contrary to it, she sends succours to the weakest places<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or to such as are most

She foresees the evils that are to come, or if she think sometimes that the Rebels are capable of Reason, she ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts them to obedience; and to reduce them to their duty, she lays before them their own interests; she makes them know, that all the pleasures which they seek after, are fatal to them, and that all the evils which they so fear, are honourable. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance is a little more exposed to danger; for she is obliged to come to handy-blows, and to defend her self against her enemies, which are so much the more dangerous as they are the more pleasing.</p>
                     <p>She resisteth all those Passions which flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our senses, and which propound nothing unto our minds, but voluptuousness and delights; she regulates desires and hopes, she moderates love and joy, and as oft as any motions rise up with us, which promise unto us unlawful pleasures, she furnisheth us with weapons to overcome them; when she thinks her self not strong enough to vanquish them, she calls in Penance and Austerity to her aid, and with these severe virtues she defeats these dissolute enemies: fortitude takes care to govern the most vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

nor sparkle out in his words nor actions, for all the doors of his soul are shut up, and not being able to fathom this depth, they are enforced to consult with such as come near unto it, or else to believe report. But all these are uncertain ways, and who builds his belief only upon the report of others, is in danger to be deceived; for Fame is fickle, Enemies are Liars, Friends Flatterers, and those of the Houshold are interessed. Yet of as many people as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost great ones, the testimony of their Domesticks is least suspitious; and as they are by their conditions bound to study their Masters humor, they are better acquainted with their inclinations; their Enemies know only their weakness; the hatred wherewith they are blinded, will not suffer them to see their virtues; and their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as being passionate, are for the most part unjust; their friends see only what is good in them, and their love makes them take faults for perfections. Their Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks are better informed than the rest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they know their inclinations, and read in those faithful Glasses, the secretest motions of their hearts; for when Princes appear in publick, they study their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; they conceal their thoughts,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:62020:106"/>
and are ashamed to do that upon a Theater which they do in their Closets. But when they have none but their Domesticks for witnesses, they do not constrain their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but afford their Passions all the liberty they can desire.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it behoveth that they mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them; lest discovering their own weaknesses, they give advantages to such as shall converse with them; and all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men ought to take the same care, if they will preserve their freedom; for if any one Passion be out of order, 'tis impossible to conceal it; and when it shall have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it self, it will be hard to keep our enemies from making use thereof to our prejudice. If women did not discover how much they are delighted with idle dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, they would not run so much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in their honour; but when a man shall have discovered their weakness, and shall observe that they are pleased in being prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, he insinuates himself into their likings by flattery, and makes himself beloved by them, by approving of what they love.

This is also the Devils most usual cunning, &amp; the most dangerous wile with which he useth to seduce sinners; for as he hath great lights, (though he be the Prince of darkness;) and as he knows all mens tempers, he fits all his suggestions to their desires, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds nothing unto them which is not conformable to their inclinations. To the proud he proffers honour, he awakens the Passion which possesseth them, and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:62020:107"/>
ingageth them in unlawful ways, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass pernicious designes; and endeavors to perswade them, that any whatsoever sin, is glorious, when it is committed that repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation may be won thereby. He sollicits the voluptuous by infamous pleasures; If he cannot commend their sins, he seeks out names to excuse them; he terms that natural which is irrational; and, as if Nature and Reason were at enmity, he counsels them to follow the former, and forsake the latter. He encourageth the furious to revenge, he gives gallant Titles to shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Passions, he endeavours to make the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment of an injury pass for an act of Justice; and contradicting all Maximes of Christianity, he establisheth the greatness of courage in hatred and murder. He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades the avaritious that there is nothing more generally sought after than Riches; that our Ancestors have reverenced it, that our Successors will honour it, that people who differ in other opinions, agree in the reputation they put hereupon; that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wish it to their children, that children desire it from their fathers; that those who profess piety, offer thereof to God, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease his anger by presents. That poverty is infamous; that it is the contempt of rich
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:62020:107"/>
men, and the punishment of the poor. In fine, this colloguing enemy undoes all men by flattering them, he gains upon their understanding by their affections, he beats them with their own weapons, and by a dangerous piece of cunning, he employes their Passions to corrupt their wills. All men ought therefore to suppress such inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as are so prejudicial to us; and submit unruly motions to Grace, which give so much advantage over our liberty, to our most powerful enemies.</p>

                     <p>THe government of Passions is of such importance, and so difficult, as the better part of Sciences seem only to have been invented to regulate them.

                        </gap> made use thereof only to cure our souls with delight. Musick which doth only tickle our ears, and wherewithal our heart is not affected, save only so far as thereby to let in impurity thereinto, labour'd formerly only to suppress the disorders thereof; as it it is an harmony composed of different voices, it produced harmonious effects; and agreeing the difference between the body and the soul, it renewed their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and made them keep perfect intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence together; it calmed the fury of Passions, and by the pleasantness of its accords, it tamed such wild beasts as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour men when they are irritated. In these happy days Musitians were <hi>Philosopher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi>; this art which is become a slave to sensuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, was Virtues servant; it employed all its industry in the service of Reason, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now it seduceth the soul by the senses; it did then charm affections through the ears, and by pleasing tones, which were no less powerful than words, it perswaded to good things, and kept men within their duties. Thus 'tis said that <hi>Agistus</hi> could never corrupt <hi>Clitemnestra,</hi> till he had made him be made away, who defended her Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity by the sweetness of his Harp, and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:62020:108"/>
who overthrew all the designs of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaste lover, by the sweet accents of his voice. History (which is more to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved than fables) teacheth us, that a player upon the Flute wrought so powerfully up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mind of <hi>Alexander,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

But Musick hath now no more such virtue; she who formerly did dispossess people possessed with evil spirits, doth now give them over to the Devil; or if she produce not so bad effects, she awakens our Passions, and by a strange, but true misfortune, she increaseth the malady which she intended to cure. I very well know that the Musick used in Churches holds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:62020:109"/>
with Piety, and that by a sweet violence it frees our souls from our bodies, and raiseth them up to Heaven; but truly I suspect all other sorts of Musick; though some will have them pass for harmless, I esteem them dangerous or useless; and I should willingly say with <hi>Seneca,</hi>

                        <hi>Poetry</hi> (which we may stile the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Musick) did in former times imitate her Mother; and employed all her comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in encouraging men to glorious Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes; she sung the victories of Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and by praising their Valour, made their Souldiers valiant; her very forgeries were useful; the revengeful Furies which she introduced in her works, infused fear into the wicked, and kept people in their duty: the pleasing number and cadence of her Verse was able to sweeten the most sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage humors, and she abused us not when she would perswade us that her <hi>Orpheus</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Lions, made Trees to walk, forced

Rocks to listen unto him, and to follow him, since he produced all these effects in the heart of man, and that he banished from thence Choler and Stupidity. But this brave Art never appeared more glorious than when it got upon the Theater, and when infused with a new fury, it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented the punishment of the faulty, the direful death of tyrants, and the ill success of injustice or impiety. For it infused fear into Princes, it astonished Subjects, and by sad examples taught the one Respect, the other Clemency, and to both of them, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and Religion. Then all Comedies were as so many instructions; one looked upon the places where they were acted, as upon the Academies of <hi>Philosophers,</hi> and Auditors never departed with the dislike of Virtue. But men who corrupt the best things, did at last abuse Poetry; and did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly submit her unto their Passions, who had reformed them by her advice. This innocent art which had always courted vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, is become a slave to vice; and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton people have prophaned all her chaste decencies; making them serve uncleanness. Since these unhappy days Poetry was cried down throughout the world; <hi>Philosophers</hi> who had always been the Poets Friends,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:62020:110"/>
became their enemies, and employed all their credit to get them banish'd. In effect they corrupted all men, and fearing lest their Verses were not of power enough to authorize obsceneness, they erected Altars thereunto; and by the Incest of their Gods, they excused the Adulteries of men. I am not ignorant that true Religion hath reformed Poetry; that it hath done its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most to restore her to her former use, and ancient beauty: I know very well that our Poets are chaste in their Writings; and that Comedies, though they be licentious, mount not the Stage, but only to condemn Vice; the very rules imposed upon them, will not suffer them to be obscene; and by a happy necessity it behoves that those who infuse a soul into the Scene, take part al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with Virtue; yet it unfortunately falls out (the which I rather attribute to the disorder of Nature, than to the like o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> the obedience of the Passions seems not so pleasing as their rebellion.

unto them with more delight. In fine, let what care soever will be had, Comedies are only Schools of Virtue for such gallant men, as can discern between appearances and truth, and who abhor Vice even then when it comes presented in Virtues Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But if you will examine the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, they will confess, that Stage-Poetry doth strangely move them, and that it imprints in their souls the feelings of those personages which they represent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rhetorick</hi> is somewhat more happy in her designs than is Poetry; and let men ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject what fault they will to Orators, I find them more blameless than Poets. For as their chief end is to preserve the truth, they are enforced to employ all their cunning to beat down such Passions as are contrary thereunto; and in discharging themselves of their duty, they play the part of the Physitian, curing their auditors of all their maladies; If their Choler be too much ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritated, they appease it; If their Courage be too much supprest, they raise it up; they make Love exceed Hatred, Piety Revenge; and repressing one motion by another, they draw a calm from out a storm. This em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment is so fixt to the condition of Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, as they do therein only differ from <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers</hi>;
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:62020:111"/>
for these have no other design, save only to convince the understanding, they propound naked Truths unto it; and knowing that it cannot behold them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reverence, they take more care how to discover, than to adorn them. But Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors who will work upon the soul by the senses, cloath their good Reasons in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som Language, tickling the Ear, that they may touch the Heart; and using Tropes and figurative Speeches, to move affection. They set upon the two parts whereof man is composed, they make use of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to subdue the stronger; and as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil undid man by the means of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, they gain Reason by the means of Passion.</p>
                     <p>By this harmless cunning, they formed Towns, governed Common-wealths, and for a long time commanded Monarchies; for they studied their inclinations, and did so handsomly handle them, as it seemed the hearts of Princes were in the hands o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Orators, and that Monarchy was become a slave to Eloquence; they committed not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding gross faults in their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by having too oft excited the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the souls inferior part, they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrew the Empire of the superior; and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:62020:111"/>
could not cure the wounds which they had made, nor quench the flames which they had kindled. For thinking to flatter a Prince in his vanity, they made him insolent, and whilst they thought to move him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, they made him cruel and fierce. They could not keep the mediocrity whereof Virtue is composed, and desiring to raise up one Passion, that they might abase ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they gave it so great strength, as it was no longer in their power to assubject it to Reason. This, in my opinion, is the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune which they run into, who, that they may be pleasing unto Princes, flatter such an inclination as doth tyrannize over them; and not considering the evil that may ensue thereon, oppose that inclination, to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and by victories make it insolent. The contrary way had been the better; for since the Passion which they ende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ored to raise, was most violent, they should have employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the rest to weaken it, and have made them all conspire together, to bring it low. But because eloquence is oft-times in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed, she neglects the good of her Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and is not troubled though her praises wound their souls, so long as she may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what she desires. Thus did <hi>Cicero</hi> treat with <hi>Caesar</hi>; and being desirous to save a
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:62020:112"/>
guilty person whose cause he pleaded, he opposed the pride of this Conqueror to his revenge; to destroy one Passion which was prejudicial only to one particular man, he awakened that which had ruined the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, and opprest the liberty of <hi>Rome.</hi> Wherein certainly he was to blame, and sinn'd against the laws of Eloquence, which was not so much invented to perswade men, as to make them virtuous, and which ought not to endeavour so much to move affections, as to re-establish Reason in her Empire. Policy seems to have better inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions than Rhetorick; for when she excites fear or hope in man, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises or by threats, she endeavours the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of particulars, as the publick quiet; if she sometimes punish the faulty by dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful punishments, 'tis but in desperate evils, and when she hath, to no purpose, tried all mild means; yet I believe she might handle Passions better than she doth, and that without violating the respects wdich is due to Soveraignty, too easie to gain the hearts of the Subjects by hopes, and to reduce them to their duties rather by love than fear. This is that which we shall consider in the following Discourse, after having concluded in this, that all Sciences are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:62020:112"/>
in the government of Passions; that to regulate them well, they must implore help from morality, &amp; that they must consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the precepts she giveth us to overcome enemies, which are as opinionate as insolent.</p>

                     <head>The THIRD DISCOURSE. That Princes win upon their Subjects either by Love or Fear.</head>
                     <p>ALl Politicians agree, that recompense and punishment are the two pillars which uphold all States; and that, to the end the people may be peacefully go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, their hopes or their fears must be excited by promises or threats; to say truth, we never yet heard of any Republick or Monarchy, which from its beginning did not ordain honours and chastisements for Vice and Virtue. He who feared to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct Vice by forbidding it, and to teach subjects paricide, by punishing it, was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to have recourse to this common reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and to propose recompenses, and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:62020:113"/>
to men, thereby to awaken their hopes or their fears. Experience shewed that to gain their good will, their Passions must be won upon, and that the lower part of their souls must be mastered, so to assubject the higher part thereof.</p>
                     <p>God himself governs the world by this harmless piece of cunning; for though, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infinitely more absolute than all Kings, he may treat with the soul without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposition of the senses, he rules himself according to mans condition; and knowing that they are composed of a Soul and Body, he undertakes nothing upon the former but by the means of the latter; he renounceth his own rights, that he may adapt himself to the weakness of his Creatures, and not using the power his Soveraignty affords him, he terrifieth them by threats, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth them by promises. His bare will should serve us for a Law; and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his intentions oblige us to form whatsoever design; notwithstanding he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lureth us, by proposing a Paradise unto us; he terrifieth us in representing us with a Hell; and as if he were much interessed in our Souls health, or in our damnation, he employs all his Graces to purchase our love and to shun our hatred.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:62020:113"/>
when he treated with the <hi>Iews</hi> as with his subjects; when through his excessive good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness he disdained not to own the quality of their Soveraign; when he gave them Laws by the mouth of <hi>Moses,</hi> and when he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned them by the wisdom of their Judges, who were but his Images, he terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them many times by his Chastisements, and sent plagues and famine into their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations, to reduce them to obedience by fear. He many times also promised them to enlarge their Borders, to assist them in their Battels, and to give them advantage over their enemies, to the end that solicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hopes by his promises, he might by their Passions win their good wills. In fine, all the world confesseth, that Polititi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, like Orators, cannot more violently, nor yet with more sweetness win mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, than by awakening the motions of his Soul, and by dexterously insinuating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into him by the hopes of Honour, or fear of punishment; but they do not agree which of these two passions ought to be employed to reduce him the more assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his duty.</p>
                     <p>Those who take part with fear,<note place="margin">Inter Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pem &amp; Subdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos non est a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micitia. <hi>Arist.</hi> 1.

relation cannot be taken from them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking away their condition, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reducing them into the quality of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or friends; they add, that it is in the power of the Soveraign to make himself be feared, not to make himself be loved; that punishments make greater impression upon the souls of such as obey, than rewards; that love is always voluntary, and that fear may be enforced; that contempt, which is the capital enemy to Monarchy, may proceed as well from love as from familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; that fear can only produce hatred, which injureth more the reputation, than the power of Kings; that since wisdom will have us to chuse the lesser of two evils, we must resolve to lose the love of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to preserve their respect, and say with that ancient Author, Let him hate me, provided that he fear me. They confirm all these reasons by examples, and make it appear, that the most severe Empires have flourished the most, that punishments have always exceeded rewards, and that in the <hi>Roman</hi> Common-wealth, where they gave but an oaken Garland to such souldiers as had mounted a Breach, they made them pass the Pikes for having gone out of their Rank, or forsaken their Colours; that God
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62020:114"/>
himself (whose government ought to serve for an example to all Princes) governed his people with more severity than lenity, that he had been constrained to express himself by the voice of Thunder to work obedience to him, that he had not preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his authority by the death of Rebels, and that notwithstanding whatever inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he had to Mercy, he was enforced to have recourse to Justice. Briefly, they say, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty is somewhat hateful, that Love and Majesty agree not well together, that one cannot rule over men and be beloved, that men are so jealous of their liberty, as they hate all things that obviate it, and that Princes according to the Maxime in the Gospel,<note place="margin">Inimici homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis domestici ejus. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.</note> have no greater enemies than their Subjects.</p>
                     <p>Those who take part with love have no less specious reasons, and much more true ones; for they say that the Soveraign being the Father of his people, he is bound to treat them as his Children, that fear makes them only Masters of the Body, and that love makes them rule over the Heart. That such as fear their Masters, seek an end of their servitude, and that such as love them dream not of recovering their Liberty. That such Princes as govern with rigour,

                     <head>The FOURTH DISCOURSE. What Passions ought to reign in the power of a Prince.</head>
                     <p>ONe of the greatest Misfortunes which can befall Religion, is the liberty which men take to frame unto themselves such a Divinity as liketh them best; In the first age every one ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the workmanship of his own hands, and made an Idol unto himself, which had its worth from the industry of the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or from the excellency of the Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; in pursuit of time, as mens spirits grew more refined, Poets made the gods sensible, and gave them all such affections as make us faulty or miserable: one might see them make love in their Writings, fight in Fables; and one might observe in them all the chief affections of those that had invented them; Philosophers not able to endure so unjust gods, formed more rational Deities,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:62020:117"/>
and proposed unto the people the Idols of their own minds; every one figured out unto himself a god according to his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and gave him what advantages may be imagined: Some placed him in idleness, and that they might not trouble his rest, berest him of the knowledge, or government of our affairs; some made him so good, as that he suffered all faults to go unpunisht, and dealt as favourably with the guilty as with the innocent; others made him so rigorous, as it seemed he had created man only to destroy him, and that he found no contentment but in the death of his Subjects; this disorder hath passed from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion into State-government, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ages wherein men have lived, they have framed unto themselves divers <hi>Ideas</hi> of Kings personages, and have placed in their Princes such perfections only as they were acquainted withal; for in the beginning of the world, when people pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the body before the soul, they chose such Kings as were of an extraordinary sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and who were as strong as Giants: Nay,<note place="margin">Ab humero &amp; sursum emine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat super om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem populum. 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> c. 9.</note> it seemed that God would apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to this humor, when he gave <hi>Saul</hi> unto the <hi>Israelites</hi>; for the Scripture sayes, <hi>He was higher by the head than all his subjects</hi>; and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:62020:118"/>
when the Poets describe unto us their <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes,</hi> they never fail in giving them this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; but when time had taught us that our good resided not in the body, men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to consider the mind of such men as they would make their Kings, and cast their eyes upon such as had most of government in them, or most of courage; they observed their inclinations, and knowing what power their inclinations have over their wills, they esteemed them no less than Virtues.</p>
                     <p>But Opinions do so differ upon this Subject, as a man may say that every Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician fancies unto himself a Prince accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his humour, and indues him with that Passion which is most agreeable unto himself. Some have wished that their Prince had no Passion at all, and that being the Image of God, he should be raised above the Creatures, he should see all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth without any alteration o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> spirit; but we know very well that his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a higher condition than his subjects makes him not be of another nature; and that since he is not exempt from the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases of the Body, he cannot defend himself against the passions of the soul. Others have been of opinion that he ought to have a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:62020:118"/>
he should be in a perpetual motion, and employ all his care, and all his thoughts upon the welfare of his State. Some have thought that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of glory was the most lawful Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a King,<note place="margin">Contemptu famae, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni virtutes. <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit.</hi> 4. annal.</note> and that since Fortune had endued him with all the goods she could confer upon him, he should only labour how to atchieve honour. That virtue was only preserved by this desire, and that he who valued not reputation, could not love Justice, that a Prince ought not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the eternizing of his memory by the pomp of glorious Buildings, but by the gallantry of his actions; that setting all other things at nought, he should only study how to leave a happy memory of his reign after his death.<note place="margin">Caetera princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pibus statim adesse, unum insatiabiliter parandum, prosperam sui memoriam. <hi>Tacit.</hi> 4. annal.</note> That nothing could more further him in this generous design than an insatiable desire of Glory; that Riches were the goods of particular men, but that glory was the humor of Kings; and that he might well hazard all other things to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass it. Others less glorious, but more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, have thought that fear ought to reign in the soul of Princes, and that as their wisdom exceeded their valour, the apprehension of danger should in them also surpass the desire of glory; for to boot
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:62020:119"/>
that their fortune is exposed to a thousand mischiefs; that the greater it is, it runs the greater danger; that it is the more brittle by how much the more glorious; they are bound to prevent accidents by their watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, to withstand storms by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, and to forgo their own happiness, to share in the misery of their Subjects.</p>
                     <p>All these opinions are upheld by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; for there have been some Kings who have known so well how to moderate their passions, as they seemed not to have any; they have not been troubled at ill Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses, and they would receive the news of a Defeat, with the same countenance, as the tidings of Victory. The quiet of their mind was not altered by the divers functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they were obliged unto; they punished faults with the same easiness as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded Virtue; and whatever alteration befell their States, you should find none in them; they seemed to be raised to so high a pitch of perfection, as one might say, in the weakness of man they had the assurance of a God.<note place="margin">Quid majus est quam in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitate ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis, habere securitatem Dei? <hi>Sen.</hi>
                        </note> There have been others, whose government hath been no less happy, and who have yet been of a quite different disposition; for as their Empire was no less dear unto them than were their own bodies,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:62020:119"/>
no alteration could happen therein which might not be read in their faces; good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess put them in good humor, they were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted at unhappy accidents, they were touched to the quick even with evils that threatned them from afar off, and every thing that befel their State made so strong an impression in them, as they seemed to live in two bodies, and that having two lives to lose, they had two deaths to fear. I dare not blame this their restlesness, since it was occasioned by an extream love; and a body must be unjust to condemn a Prince that makes himself miserable, for no other cause, but that he may make his Subjects happy. <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> was of this humor, and though he had endeavoured to compass so much constancy, as not to be troubled at any thing, yet could he not hear of any good or bad success which befel his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, without witnessing his resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof by his word and actions. <hi>Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> his defeat cost him tears, and this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent which he was not prepared for, made him say such things as I do rather impute to his affection than to his weakness, since up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other occasions he had given so good proof of his Courage.</p>
                     <p>Their number is great who have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:62020:120"/>
after glory, and who have had no other Passion but how to acquire honour. Nothing seemed difficult unto them which bear with it the face of glory, insomuch as by an inevitable misfortune, they neglected virtue, when in obscurity; and put a valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon a glorious vice. According to their Tenets it was as lawful to overthrow a State as to found one, to oppress a Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, as to defend it; and to undertake a War against Allies, as well as against Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.<note place="margin">Prosperum ac felix scelus virtus vocatur. <hi>Sen.</hi> Tragoed.</note> They run after glory by unlawful wayes, and as some make fortunate faults pass for Virtues, these took glorious pieces of injustice for heroick Actions.

There needs
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:62020:120"/>
no great policy go to the observation, that so unruly a Passion is disadvantageous to States, and that this is not that which ought to precede in the soul of Princes.</p>
                     <p>I shall therefore willingly side with those who attribute this honour to the zeal of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and who will have the hearts of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs animated by this harmless affection; for since the welfare of their people is the end of all their labours, the justice that must produce and preserve it, must be the scope of their desires, and they must main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a well grounded quiet in the variety of conditions whereof their States are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. Who is not indued with this vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, knows not how to reign; and though he have all the rest, he deserves not to bear a Scepter, since he wants that which makes Kings good, and Kingdoms happy. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not end this Discourse without taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the excessive obligation which we have to Divine providence, who hath given us a Prince of so pure inclinations, as he seems to have no part in this sin, which hath put our nature out of order; and who loveth Justice so passionately, as he would be therewithal adorn'd, and chose the title of just, as the only recompence of all his he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick virtues. He might have assumed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:62020:121"/>
to himself the title of happy, as well as <hi>Sylla</hi>; since the Sea hath born respect unto his endeavours, that the <hi>Alpes</hi> have humbled themselves, and their Snow dissolved to make way for his victorious forces; and that upon a thousand occasions the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have fought in his behalf; he might have taken the title of Great, as well as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> since his Actions have exceeded our hopes, and that he hath undertaken, and effected designs which all his predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors have thought unpossible: Lastly, he might have challenged the name of Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as well as <hi>Trajan,</hi> since men may num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his Victories by his Battels, since his souldiers were never worsted in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and since good success hath alwayes accompanied his Enterprizes. But know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Justice is the Virtue of Kings, he hath contented himself with the Title of <hi>Iust,</hi> and hath preferred it before those of <hi>Happy, Great,</hi> or <hi>Victorious</hi>; to teach all Monarchs, that Zeal of the publick good is the passion which chiefly ought to rule in them.</p>

thereof, leaving us in a despair how to know a Passion which he knew not: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he terms it sympathizing, sometimes an inclination, sometimes a complacency, and teacheth us by these different terms, that the nature of Love is no less obscure, than is the nature of the Soul.</p>
                     <p>Amongst so many doubts, some Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers affirm, that it is the first impression which the <hi>Bonum</hi> sensible makes in the heart of man, that 'tis a pleasing wound which man hath received from a fair Object, that it is the Beam of a Sun which warms him, that it is a Charm whose virtue is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive, and that it is the first motion which carries him, either to what appears to be good, or to what truly is so. But if I may be permitted to differ from common opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that I may follow the more true, I will say that Love is all the Passions; that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its different conditions it hath diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent names, but that custom hath so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, as in its birth it beareth the most glorious name; for when an inclination is formed in the heart, and that a pleasing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject doth with delight stir up the Will, we call it Love; when it sallies forth from it self to join with what it loves, we call it Desire; when it grows more vigorous,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:62020:123"/>
and that its strength promiseth good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, we call it Hope; when it encourageth it self against the difficulties it meets with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, we call it Choler; when it prepares to fight, and seeks out weapons to defeat its enemies, and to assist its Allies, we call it Boldness. But in all these conditions 'tis still Love; the name which Philosophers have given it in its birth, agrees not less with it in his progress; and if when but a Child, it merit so honourable a title, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves it better when it is grown greater by Desires, and strengthened by Hopes. 'Tis true that Loves first condition is the rule of all the rest, and that as all rivers derive their greatness from their Spring-head, all the Passions borrow their strength from this first inclination which is termed Love; for as soon as it is taken with the beauty of an object, it kindles its desires, excites its hopes, and carries the fire into all the passions which hold of its Empire: 'tis in the Will as in a Throne, where it gives orders to its sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; 'tis in the bottom of the soul as in a strong Hold, from whence it inspireth courage into its souldiers; 'tis like the heart which giveth life to all the members, and the power thereof is so great as it cannot be well expressed by any example. Kings oft
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:62020:124"/>
times meet with disobedience in their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; the most valiant Commanders are sometimes forsaken by their Souldiers, and the heart cannot always disperse its spirits throughout all the members of the Body; but Love is so absolute in his dominion, as he never finds any resistance to his will; all the Passions get on foot to execute his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and as the motion of the Moon causeth the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, so doth the motions of Love cause peace, or trouble in our soul.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Charitas Dei diffusa est in cordibus per Spiritum san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum, qui da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus est nobis. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.</note>Now this Love, the nature whereof is so hidden, hath divers branches; and may be divided into natural and supernatural; the latter is that which God disperseth into our wills, to make us capable of loving him as our Father, and of pretending unto glory as to our inheritance; the former is that which Nature hath imprinted in our souls, to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten us to those objects which are delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to us; and this is divided into spiritual and sensible love; spiritual love resides in the will, and rather deserveth to be stiled a Virtue than a Passion; sensible love is in the lower part of the soul, and hath so much commerce with the Senses, from whence he borrows his name, as he always makes impression upon the Body; and this it is
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:62020:124"/>
which is properly termed Passion. In fine, these two lovers are divided again into two others; the one of which is called the love of Friendship, the other the love of Interest. The first is the more noble, and he who is touched therewith, respecteth nothing but what may be advantageous to whom he loveth;<note place="margin">Amor amici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae &amp; amor concupiscentiae In quid ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum paro?

This noble Passion is that which hath done all the glorious actions which are observed in History; 'Tis she that hath filled Tyrants with admiration, and who hath made these enemies to Society, wish to love, and to be beloved; judging aright that Soveraigns are better guarded by their friends than by their souldiers, and that all their forces were but weak, were they not supported by the love of their Subjects.<note place="margin">Qui amicus esse coepit, quia expedit, place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit ei aliquod pretium contra amicitiam, si ullum in illa placet pretium praeter ipsam.</note> The second sort of Love, which we term the love of Interest, is as common as unjust; for the greatest part of affections is grounded upon utility, or upon pleasure; those who suffer themselves to be carried away thereby, have not so much friendship as self-love,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:62020:125"/>
and if they will speak their minds,<note place="margin">Ista quam tu describis, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiatio est, non amicitia, quae ad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modum acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, <hi>Sen.</hi> Ep. 9.</note> they will confess that they love themselves in their friends, and that they love them not so much for any virtue, which they observe in them, as for the good they hope to reap by them; thus we may see that such like af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections last no longer then they are either useful, or pleasing; and that the same interest which gave them life, makes them die; they betake themselves to the fortune, not to the person, and these are commerces which last no longer than they are entertained by hopes of profit or of pleasure.</p>
                     <p>Of so many sorts of love which Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy hath marked out unto us, we will here consider none but that which resides in the inferior part of the soul; let it have either virtue or interest for its foundation. And since we know the nature thereof, we will examine the qualities; the first whereof is, that it always seeks what is good, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver betakes it self to an object, which either is not good, or appears not so to be; for as nature is the workmanship of God, she can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have strayed so much out of the way, but that she must preserve some remainder of his first inclinations, insomuch as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been destinied to enjoy the <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> she longs after it; by an error which
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:62020:125"/>
may very well be excused, she fastens her self to all that hath but the likeness thereof, and by an instinct, which remains in her, though in disorder, she suffers her self to be charmed by all things which have in them any thing of beauty or of goodness. As if she had found what she seeks after, she in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreetly betakes her self thereunto, and by a deplorable misfortune she oft-times takes a falshood for a truth; she committeth Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry whilst she thinketh to perform actions of Piety; and attributing that unto the work, which is only due unto the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, she runs into the same error which a lover should do, who by a strange malady should forget the Mistress which he vows service to, and passionately adore her Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. This fault ought rather to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to man, than to his love; for love being blind follows his inclination, not being able to discern between appearances and truth, he loves the good which offers it self unto him; that he may not miss of what he looks for, he betakes himself to what he finds; and is only to blame in being too faithful; but man cannot excuse his sin, since Reason is his guide, and that he may learn by her, that all those goods which are touched by the senses, or are the objects of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:62020:126"/>
the senses, are but the shadows of that which he ought to love. He must correct his love, and keep it from betaking it self to objects, which though they be indeed beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, are not the Soveraign good, or <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum bonum</hi> which he seeks after. When he thinks the qualities they are endued withal may work a change in him, he might shun them as snares, and use violence upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to get free from the creatures, lest they make him forget his Creator.</p>
                     <p>From this propriety of Love ariseth a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, which is, that he never is at quiet, but goes always in pursuit of what he loves; for seeing so many shadows of that supream beauty which he adores, he is always in action, leaving one to take another, he seeks in all, what he cannot find in one alone; and his change is not so much a proof of his fickleness, as of their vanity; he becoms wise at his own cost; when he meets not with what he expects in the beauty which he idolatrizeth, he repents him of his fault, &amp; betakes himself to another subject, which he is forced to forgo again, because he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys but one part of that universal good wherewithal he is taken; his inconstancy would last as long as his life, did not reason teach him, that what he covets is invisible,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:62020:126"/>
and that the abiding place wherein we are, is not destined for the passion, but for the hope thereof; he then sets at nothing what he so much esteemed, and considering that natural beauties are but steps whereby to raise us to supernatural beauty, he loves them with reservedness, and useth them as means whereby to purchase what he seeks after.</p>
                     <p>The powerful impression which this beauty makes upon Love, causeth Loves third propriety, which is, that he cannot live in quiet, and that being solicited by his desires, he is always busie; he is of the nature of the constellations, which are in a perpetual motion; the end of one trouble is the beginning of another; and he hath not so soon ended his first design, but he frames a second; he is like those conquerors, who egged on by ambition, prepare always for new combats, never tasting the pleasure of victory. I cannot therefore approve of the Poets invention, who have feigned Love to be the son of Idleness;<note place="margin">Habet omnis amor vim su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, nec potest vacare amor in anima amantis <hi>Aug.</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 121.</note> for if his genealogy be true, we must confess he is not of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers humour. That unfortunate Poet, who was Loves Martyr, and who saw himself justly persecuted for having forged Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons against womens Chastity, avows that
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:62020:127"/>
this passion is working; and that it is so far from being at rest, as it obligeth its par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers to be souldiers; and that to love, a man must resolve to wage war. Hence it is that St. <hi>Augustin</hi> mixing sacred Love with prophane, makes them both equally ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, and acknowledgeth that a true affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction cannot be idle. Ambition, which is the love of honour, is a good proof of this, since it makes such impression upon the hearts of those that are ambitious, as they have not much more rest than have the damned, and that they are always cause of more trouble to themselves, than to those whom they oppress. Avarice, which is the love of money, doth authorize this truth no less than doth Ambition, since those wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which are therewithal possessed, rend up the bowels of the earth that they may not be unuseful, and seek out Hell before their death, that they may not be exempt from pain whilst alive. This propriety is so peculiar to Love, as it is not found in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Passions. For though our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires be the first rivulets that derive from this Spring-head, yet do they give us some respit; and when they are weary of seeking after a far distant good, they suffer us to take a little rest; we oft-times dry our tears, and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:62020:127"/>
if we make not peace, we conclude a truce with our sorrow; we do not always medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate upon revenge, and choler as so much less lasting as it hath more of impetuosity and violence. Our hatred is sometimes laid asleep, and requires a new injury to awaken it; our joys are so short, as the longest of them endure but for a moment, and they love idleness so much, as they cease to be pleasing when they begin to be operative. But Love is always in action, it tarries not till age give it strength to work, it form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth designs as soon as it is born; though abandoned by desires and hopes, it ceaseth not to think of what it loveth, and to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it self to no purpose with the thought of good success, which it never shall enjoy. In fine, activity is so natural unto it, as the life thereof consists in motion; and as the heart, it ceaseth to live when it ceaseth to move.</p>
                     <p>From hence proceeds its fourth propriety, which is the strength which doth accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany it in all its designs; for though but new born, it is vigorous, if true; and giving proofs of its courage, it tameth Monsters, which it is not yet acquainted withal; it measures its strength by its desires, &amp; thinks it self able to do whatsoever it will; it is not
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:62020:128"/>
astonished with difficulties: If one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound them to Love, that they may stay the careir thereof, he thinks 'tis done to try its Will, and solicited by glory it endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth to overcome them: Love neither accepts of, nor makes excuses. It will try all its forces before 'twill acknowledge an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, and it doth oft-times overcome enemies, which the most generous virtues durst never set upon. Hence it is that the holy Scripture compares it to death, not only for that it separateth us from our selvs, to join us to the things we love; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause nothing can resist it; for of so many pains which Divine Justice hath found out,<note place="margin">Magnum ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum fortis ut mors; Dilectio magnificentius exprimi non potuit fortitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do charitatis; quis enim mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti resistit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We save our selves from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of the Weather by Cloaths and Houses; we overcome the Barrenness of the Earth by our excessive labour; we cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect nourishments by the help of Physick; we reduce wild Beasts to our obedience by art or forces; we oft-times turn our pains in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to pleasure, and we draw advantages from the misery of our condition, which we should not have found in the state of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. But nothing can resist death; and though Physitians have found out secrets to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:62020:128"/>
prolong our lives,<note place="margin">Et quia ipsa charitas occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit quod fui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, ut simus quod non era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, facit in nobis quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam mortem dilectio: ipsa morti erant mortui quibus Apostolus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cebat, mortui estis, <hi>&amp;c.

                        </note> yet do they in vain seek out means to defend themselves against death, which makes havock throughout the whole earth, pardons neither age nor sex; and Palaces, which are environed with so many guards, cannot keep Kings from the reach thereof: So Love finds no difficulties which it overcomes not, no pride which it lays not low, no power which it tameth not, nor no rigour which it doth not allay.</p>
                     <p>Briefly, by another propriety which is not less considerable than the former, Love charmeth troubles, mingleth pleasures with pain; and to encourage us to difficult acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, finds out inventions to make them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pleasing or glorious. Hunting is rather a business than a diversion, 'tis an image of war; and men who pursue wild Beasts, seem as if they studied how to overcome their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; the Victory is therein doubtful, as well as in combates; and honour is therein purchased sometimes by the loss of life; yet all these troubles are the hunters pleasures, and their passion to this Exercise makes them term that a pastime which Reason would term a punishment. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of delight in war, the very name there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is odious; were it not accompanied with injustice, disorder, and fear, it would not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:62020:129"/>
have horrors enough to asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish all men; death makes her self be there seen in a thousand different shapes; there is no exercise in war wherein the danger doth not exceed the glory; and it never furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth souldiers with any actions which are not as bloudy as glorious; yet those that love it, make it their delight, they esteem all the deformities thereof beauties,<note place="margin">Nullo modo sunt onerosi labores aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium sed etiam ipsi delectant sicut venanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, piscanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um; interest ergo quid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metur, nam in eo quod a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matur, aut non laborantur, aut labor ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Aug.</hi>
                        </note> and by an inclination which proceeds rather from their love than from their humour, they find delight in dangers, and taste the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santness of peace in the tumults of war. This it is which made St. <hi>Augustine</hi> say, That Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers troubles are never troublesom, and that they never find pain in serving what they love, or if they do, they cherish it.</p>
                     <p>But we shall never make an end if we would observe all the proprieties of Love; I therefore pass on to the effects thereof, which being so many pictures of Love, will represent unto us its nature,<note place="margin">Extasim facit amor, amato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res suo statu dimovet, sui juris esse non finit, sed in ea quae amant penitus trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fert. <hi>Dionis.

The first of its miracles, is that which we call Exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, for it frees the Soul from the Body which she inanimates, that she may join to the Object which she loveth; it parts us from our selves by a pleasing violence; and what the holy Scripture attributes to the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:62020:129"/>
Spirit of God, befals this miraculous divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; so as a lover is never at home with himself; if you will find him, you must seek him in the person that he adores.<note place="margin">Vivo autem jam non ego, vivit vero in me Christus. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.</note> He will have people know that contrary to the Laws of wisdom, he is always without himself; and that he hath forsaken all care of his own preservation; since he became a slave to love. The Saints draw their glory from this extasie, and truth it self, which speaks by their mouths, obligeth them to confess, that they live more in Jesus Christ, than in themselves. Now as a man must die to himself, to live in another, death accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panieth this life; and as well sacred as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane lovers cannot love unless they be bound to die. 'Tis true that this death is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to them, since it procures unto them a life wherewithal they are better pleased than with that which they have lost; for they live again in those that they love; by a miracle of love, they, like the Phenix, take life again from their ashes,<note place="margin">Mortui enim estis, &amp; vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>This effect produceth another, which is not much less admirable; for as lovers have
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:62020:130"/>
no other life than what they borrow from their love, it infallibly falls out that they transform themselves thereinto, and that ceasing to be what they were, they begin to be that which they love; they change con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as well as nature, and by a wonder, which would surpass all belief, were it not usual, they become like unto that which they cherish. 'Tis true that this power shines much more gloriously in divine than in prophane Love; for though Kings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base themselves in loving their Subjects, and that they forgo their greatness, as soon as they engage themselves in friendship, yet do they not raise those up into their Throne whom they love. Jealousie (which is inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from Royalty) will not suffer them to give their Crown away to him who pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth their heart. But if they should arrive at this excess, the Maxim would only be true in them, and their Subjects could not change conditions by the force of their love, for the love of greatness makes not a Soveraign, nor is a man the more accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated though he love riches; the desire of health did never yet cure a sick man; &amp; we have not found, that the bare Passion to know, hath made men wise. But divine Love hath so much power, as it raseth us up above our selves, &amp; by a strange Metamorphosis it
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:62020:130"/>
makes us be that which it makes us love; It renders the guilty innocent; it makes slaves children, changeth Demons into Angels; and that we may not diminish the virtue thereof, whilst we think to heighten it, let it suffice to say, that of men, it makes Gods.</p>
                     <p>It doth not therefore become us to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of our misery,<note place="margin">Quid enim refert natura esse quod po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test effici vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntate. <hi>D. Chrys.</hi> De laud. <hi>Paul.</hi> Hom. 6.</note> and to accuse our Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, for not having equalled our condition to that of Angels; for though those pure spirits have great advantages over us, and that we hope for no other good than that which they possess, yet are we happy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, since we are permitted to love God, and that we are made to hope, that our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being by love transformed into his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we shall lose what we have of mortal, and perishable, to acquire what is incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible and eternal. This is the Consolation of divine Lovers, and this is the only means how to aspire, without blame, to that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, which <hi>Lucifer</hi> could not do, but with impiety. I cannot end this Discourse with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out justly reproaching those that whilst they may love God, engage their affections on the earth, or on earthly things, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive themselves of that immense felicity which divine love promiseth them; for in loving of the creatures, they cannot share in
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:62020:131"/>
their perfections, without doing the like in their defaults; after having laboured much they oft-times change an obscure and pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable condition, into a more glorious, but a more dangerous one. So there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways hazard in the love of the creatures, and the advantage that may be drawn from thence, is never so pure, but that it is ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with somewhat of misfortune. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever passion we have for the creature, we are not sure the creature hath the like for us; yet this miraculous change, which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth for the principal effect of love is made in this mutual affection, and in this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency of friendship. But we run not these hazzards in consecrating our love to God; his perfections are not accompanied with faults; and we know it cannot be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous to us, to make a change with him. Our love is never without this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, since it is rather the effect than the cause of his, and that we love not him, till he hath first loved us. He is so just as he never denies our affection the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense which it deserves; he is not like those misbelieving Mistresses, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the numbers of their Lovers, prefer him who is best behaved, before him that loveth best; in the commerce which we
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:62020:131"/>
hold with him, we are sure that he that hath most charity, shall have most glory, and that in his Kingdom the most faithful lover shall be always the most honoured.</p>

For during the state of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, men had no love save only for good, and nature was so well temper'd with grace, as that all her inclinations were holy: In this happy condition, charity and self love
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:62020:132"/>
were the same thing; and a man feared not to injure his neighbour by loving himself; but since his disobedience, his love changed Nature; he who looked upon another mans advantage and his own with the same Eye, began to separate them; and forgetting what he ought to God, he made a god of himself. He confounded all the Laws of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noceney, and as if he alone had been in the world, he forsook the sweets of Society, he took a resolution to rule his affections by his own interests, and to love no longer any thing but what was useful and pleasing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. This mischief, like poyson, disperst it self throughout the whole fabrick of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and Reason cannot defend her self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, without the assistance of Grace. The gallantest actions lost their lustre by this irregularity; Philosophy by all her precepts could not reform a disorder, which was rather in the bottom of Nature, than in the Will. She put some of her might to fight against this Monster, and spying a glimering of light amidst the darkness with which she was blinded, she confessed that man did not belong so much to himself as to his Country, and that he ought endeavour more the glory of the State, than the good of his own family. She thought that the love
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:62020:132"/>
of our neighbour should be formed upon the love of our selves, and believed that in willing us to treat them as our selves, she had corrected all the abuse of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But this malady lying not only in the Understanding, her advice was not sufficient to cure it, so as she was enforced to confess that there was none could reform man, but he that made him. Thus shall we find no remedy for our misfortunes but by the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of Grace; and our desires have had no freedom, save since Jesus Christ came into the world to banish self-love from out our souls; for his coming had no other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, nor his Doctrine any other end, than the ruine of this dreadful Monster. He set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth upon it throughout all his Maxims, and hardly doth any word proceed from his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine mouth which gives it not a mortal wound. He protests he would admit of no Disciples, who have not changed their self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love into an holy aversion;<note place="margin">Si quis venit ad me, &amp; non odit patrem suum, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem, &amp; uxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, &amp; filios, &amp; fratres, &amp; sorores, adhuc autem &amp; ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam suam, non potest meus esse disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulus, <hi>Luc.</hi> 14.</note> and that he will not suffer any Subject in his Kingdom, who are not ready to lose their lives for the glory of their Soveraign.

selves. Mortification and Humility, which are the ground-works of his doctrine, tend only to destroy this inordinate affection which we bear unto our Souls, or our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. In fine, he hath appointed us charity, only to overthrow self-love,<note place="margin">Interficiens inimicitias in semetipso. <hi>Eph.</hi> c. 2.</note> and he died upon the Cross, only to make his enemy die, which is the cause of all our quarrels and divisions.</p>
                     <p>We ought also to confess that this evil includes all others, and that there is no disorder in the world which doth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this for its original; and I am of opinion, that a man cannot only not make a good Christian of one that doth too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively love himself, but I hold that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the laws of Policy and Morality, one cannot make a good man, nor a good Statesman, of such a man; for Justice it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary in all manner of conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and this Virtue cannot subsist with self-love. Justice will have a man endued with Reason, to prefer the inclinations of the soul before those of the body, and that he preserve all the rights of authority to the Soveraign. Self-love (which leans al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways towards the flesh) will have the slave to govern his Master, and that the Body command over the Soul; Justice will have
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:62020:133"/>
a good man not to wish for any thing which exceeds his merit, or his birth; and she in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structeth him, that to be happy and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent he must prescribe bounds to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs. Self-love commands us to follow our own inclinations, and to govern our desires only according to our Vanity; it flatters our Ambition, and to insinuate it self into us, it gives us leave to do what we please. Justice will have a good Statesman prefer the publick interest before that of his own house; that he be ready to lose his wealth, and to sacrifice his own person for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of his Country; she perswades him that there is no death more glorious than that which is suffered for the defence of a mans Country; and that the <hi>Horatii</hi> and <hi>Scaevola's</hi> are famous in the <hi>Roman</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, only for having sacrificed themselves to the Glory of their Common-wealth; though there be nothing more natural to a man than to love his Children, some men have been found, whom Justice hath made to lose this affection to preserve the like of good Statesmen; who solicited by this Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, have butcherd those whose fathers they were, teaching by so rigorous an example, that the love to a mans Country, ought to exceed the love to his own flesh and blood.

love of Beauty, which we term Incontinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. The second is the love of Riches, which we call Avarice. The third is the love of Glory, which we call Ambition. These three capital enemies of mans welfare and quiet, corrupt all that belongs to him, and render him guilty in his soul, in his body, and in his goods. It is hard to say which of these three monsters is hardest to overcome; for to boot, with their natural forces, they have Auxiliaries, which they draw from our inclinations, or from our habits, and which make them so redoubted, that they are not to be overcome without a miracle. To consider them notwithstanding in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, Ambition is the most haughty and the strongest; Voluptuousness, the most mild and soft; and Avarice the basest, and most opinionated.</p>
                     <p>These are fought against by divers means, and all Morality is busied in furnishing us with reasons to defend our selves against them. The Vanity of Honour hath cured some that have been thereof ambitious:<note place="margin">Quosdam cum in consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem digui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis, per mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le indignitates erexissent.</note> For when they come to know that they labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after a good which happened not to them till after death, and that from so many dangerous actions they could only expect to have their sepulchers adorn'd, or some commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation

The infamy of the volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, the mischiefs which accompany them, the displeasures which follow them, and the shame which never forsakes them, have oft-times cured men to whom sin had left a little reason. Age may likewise be a cure for this; it is a disorder in nature to find a lascivious old man; and it is no less strange to see love under gray hairs, than to see those mountains whose heads are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with snow, and whose bowels are full of flames. The misery of riches, the pain that is taken in accumulating them, the care in preserving them, the evils which they cause to their owners,<note place="margin">Miser est om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis animus vinctus amici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia rerum tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralium, &amp; dilaniatur cum eas amittit, &amp; tunc sentit mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seriam qua mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser est, &amp; non antequam a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittit eas. <hi>Aug.</hi> Confes. l. 4. c. 6.</note> the ease which they afford to content unjust desires, and the sorrow caused by their loss, are considerations strong enough to make those contemn them who are not as yet become slaves thereunto. But when they shall exercise their tyranny upon the spirits, I esteem their malady incurable: Age which cures other Passions, encreaseth this. Covetous men never love riches more than when they are

near losing them; and as love is then most sensible when it apprehends the absence of the party beloved; Avarice is most violent, when it apprehendeth the loss of its wealth. But without medling with another mans work, I shall content my self with saying, that to preserve a mans self from all these evils, he must endeavour to forgo self-love. For, as natural love causeth all the passions, inordinate love causeth all the Vices; and whosoever shall be vigilant in the weakning of this Passion by repentance and charity, shall find himself happily freed from Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, Ambition and Incontinency. But to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at this high degree of happiness, we must remember, that in whatsoever condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Providence hath placed us, we are not for our selves, but for the publick; and that we must not love our selves to the prejudice of our Soveraign. We are in nature a porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Universe, in civil life a part of the State, in Religion we are the Members of Jesus Christ. In all these conditions, self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love must be sacrificed to universal love. In nature we must die to give place to those that follow us. In the State, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute our goods and our bloud for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of our Prince; and in Religion, we must kill the old <hi>Adam,</hi> that Jesus Christ may live in us.</p>

There are three objects of our Love, God, Man, and Creatures deprived of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Some Philosophers have doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we could love the first, or no; they were perswaded his greatness did rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire our adoration than our love; but though this be a religious opinion, and that it merits the greater esteem since it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the prophane; we cannot deny, but that we were endued with love, to unite us to God; for to boot, with our thorough sense of this inclination, to boot, that it is imprinted by Nature in the very ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of our wills, and that uninstructed by our Parents or our Teachers, we labour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Summumbonum</hi>: Reason teacheth us that he is the Abyss of all perfections,<note place="margin">Deus nosteris est, quem amat id omne quod amare potest. <hi>Aug.</hi>
                        </note> and the Center of all love; so as a man need not fear committing any excess in loving him with all his might. He is so good as he cannot be loved so much as he ought to be; and let a man do his utmost, he is obliged to confess, that the goodness of God doth far exceed the greatness of mans Love. Such Souls as are elevated,<note place="margin">Omnia offa mea dicent, Domine, quis fimilis tibi? <hi>Psal.</hi> 34.</note> and approach nearer unto him, complain of their cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and wish that all the parts of their Bodies were turned into Tongues, to praise him; or into Hearts to love him.
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:62020:139"/>
They are troubled, that since his greatness is so well known, his goodness is no more lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and that having so many subjects, he hath no more that love him.<note place="margin">Modus aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di Deum sine modo. <hi>Bern.</hi>
                        </note> We must not then prescribe any bounds to this Passion, when it hath respect unto God, but every one ought to make it his sole desire, and to wish that his heart were dilated, that he might infinitely love him, who is infinitely lovely; but we must take great heed, not to rob him of what doth so justly belong unto him; and we must remember, that though his goodness should not force his duty from us, we should be bound to render it unto him, in order to our own interest. For our love is never content but when it rests in God. It fears infidelity in the creatures, is never so assured of them, but that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains some rational doubts; and though it should have such proofs of their good will, as that it were constrained to banish all sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition, yet would it fear lest death might take from it what good fortue hath given; &amp; in one or other of these just apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it could not shun being miserable. But it knows very well that God is immutable, &amp; that he never forsaketh us till we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken him, it knows that God is eternal, and that death being no less distant from him

                     <p>'Tis true there are carnal souls, who complain that he is invisible, and who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not resolve to give up their hearts to a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity which doth not content their eyes.

but we must wish that he may be as much loved, as he is known. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over this complaint is no more to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, since the mystery of the Incarnation, where God became man, that he might treat with men; where he hath given sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible proofs of his presence, and where clothing himself with our nature, he hath suffered our eyes to behold his beauty, our hands to touch his body, and our ears to hear his voice. Since that happy moment he is become our Allie, and he who was our Soveraign, is become our Brother, to the end that this double quality might oblige us to love him with more ardor, and might permit us to accost him with more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; we cannot then fail in the use of that love which we owe unto him, but by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either too much reserved or too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful. But the love we render to men may be defective in two manner of ways, and we may abuse it either in loving them too much, or not enough, as shall be shewn in the pursuit of this Discourse.</p>
                     <p>Friendship is certainly one of the chief effects of Love, and the harmlessest delight which men can take in Society. Very <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> did reverence the Name thereof; those who despise the Laws of Civility, put

Thieves who intrench upon the publick liberty, who make war in time of peace, and who seem desirous to stifle that love which Nature hath placed in mankind, cease not to bear respect to friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; they have a certain shadow of society amongst them; they keep their word, though with prejudice to their condition; tortures cannot sometimes make them violate their Faith; and they will rather lose their lives than betray their Companions. In fine, people subsist only by virtue hereof;<note place="margin">Amicitia plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimas res con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinet; quoquo te verteris, praesto est, ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo loco exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur, nunquam intempestiva, nuquam mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta est.

But to be just she must have her bounds, to be true she must be founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Piety; those who will love one another, must be united in faith, and must have the same sense of Religion; their friendship must be a study after Virtue, and they
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:62020:141"/>
must labour to become better by their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual communication; their souls should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be mingled than united; from this mixture a perfect community of all things must arise; their goods must be no more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided; and the words <hi>thine</hi> &amp; <hi>mine</hi> (which cause whatever there is of division in the world must be totally banished; when their conditions meet together, friendship is not to be blamed; nay, the very excess thereof is to be prais'd, since being more divine than humane, &amp; more grounded upon grace than nature, she should be freed from all those Laws which are only made for common friendship. But in the one and the other of them, the pains which accompany them must be endured, and we must remember, that as there is nothing so perfect in the world, but hath its faults, there is nothing so pleasing which hath not its dislikes. Friendship is that which sweetens life, and who is not therewithal endued, cannot hope for happiness; It is the most rational con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord which this world can afford; and of as many pleasures as are,<note place="margin">Ejus enim no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis amara mors cujus dulcis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat vita. <hi>Aug.</hi> l. 19. <hi>De Civ.

The Malady is contracted before it be known; men are oft-times in a Fever before they feel any distemper; and poyson hath already infected the heart before we think the mouth hath swallowed it. Briefly, the danger is equal on all sides; men make strong assaults, and women weak defences. The freedom of conversation makes men more insolent, and the pleasingness thereof makes women less couragious. I shall therefore never approve of such friendships as may cause more harm than advantage, and which for vain satisfaction of the sense, hazards the souls health. We live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Religion which commands us to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:62020:143"/>
pleasures which are purely innocent; we are taught by a Master which commands his Disciples to pluck out such eyes, and cut off such hands as have been cause of scandal to them; we are brought up in a School where we are forbidden to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of women; yet under pretence of a naughty custom we will have it lawful for us to win their Affections, and to contract Friendship with them, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning by irregular inclinations, are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by useless discourse, and end in cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal delights. Chastity runs hazzards e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and needs not to have new Gins laid for her. The lustre of apparel, freedom of conversation, and that which is termed ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility make sufficient open war against con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency; there needs no addition of Wiles, or cunning to surprize her. When men shall be Angels, it shall be lawful for them to contract amity with women; when death shall have severed them from their bodies, they may without scandal converse toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and satisfie their inclinations; but as long as they shall have sense common with Beasts, and that Beauty shall make more impression on their senses than Virtue, they must imitate the Prophet, which had sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced his eyes not to look upon those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent

                     <p>To remedy these evils, we must implore aid from Charity; for it is she that purifies Love, that reforms the excesses, and amends the errors thereof; she will not have it to be excessive, neither will she that it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to our own persons, or to our families; she knows that Love is disperst throughout all the world, &amp; that when it goes from us, it passeth into our enemies; <note n="*" place="margin">Incipit lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus amor con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>jugio, sed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huc carnalis est, quia com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munis cum pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coribus.

That Passion is not to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded amongst men, which is observed to be in Tigers, and a man cannot praise such na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural affections in reasonable creatures, as are seen in the most savage beasts. In its progress it extends it self to our Kindred, and begins to be rational; for though he that loves his Parents, loves his Bloud, and that though his love forgo his own Person, it doth not forgo his Family, yet is his love
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:62020:144"/>
more expiated than is the love of Fathers, and communicates it self to personages which are not so near unto him as are his Children; in the vigour thereof it passeth even unto strangers, it receives them into its house, it makes them share of what it hath, and not considering either their humors or their languages, their very having the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects of men is sufficient to make them the objects of its liberality; in this acceptation Love is well waxen, but to be perfect, it must descend even to our enemies, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing us with strength to overcome our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, it obligeth us to do good to them who endeavour to do us harm. When it is arrived at this pitch, it may hope for reward; but if it stop in the middle of its Carier, it must expect nothing but punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. These words comprehend all the use of this Passion, and I can add nothing thereunto which will not prove weak or useless; passing therefore forward, I come to the last Object of our Love, which is Creatures void of Reason.</p>
                     <p>I wonder that in this point all men joyn not with the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> and that their opinion passeth not for a law among all the people of the world; for they hold, that Creatures which want reason do not deserve our love,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:62020:145"/>
and that our will is given us only to tie us to God, or to man. Truly if this Maxim be a Paradox, I hold it extreamly rational; for what appearance is there that we should bestow our affection on Creatures which not knowing it, cannot be obliged to us for it, and having no obligation, cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious of our affection? In my opinion no man can be more prodigal than is the ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritious man, since he engageth his affection to an insensible Metal, and that he loves without hope of being re-beloved. I think no man more irrational, than he who ties his love to the beauty of a flower, which for all its odour and splendor, is not sensible of the adoration that is given it. I cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure those extravagant men, who place all their Passions upon a Dog, or a Horse, which do them no other service than what they are carried unto, either by instinct, or by necessity. I therefore think the profit which we reap by them should be the rule of the affection we bear them; or, to speak more correctly, we must rather love our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selves in them, than them for our selves; for they are too much beneath us to deserve our love; and though some shadow of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity be observed to be amongst Dogs, and some sparks of love amongst horses, yet
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:62020:145"/>
both of them being void of reason, they are uncapable of friendship. To set our hearts on things insensible, is to prophane them. It is not just that the same soul, which may love the Angels, love dumb beasts; that the soul which may unite himself to God, join itself to Metals; and that it lodge in the same heart, the noblest of all spirits, with the most imperfect of all bodies. I would then make use of Gold, yet not love it; I would be Master thereof, yet not Slave thereunto; I would keep it for my occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, not adore it; I would teach the whole world that it hath no valuation but what the good employment thereof bestows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and that it is no less useless in the bowels of the earth, than in the Coffers of the Avaritious.</p>
                     <p>But not to be mistaken in so important an affair, we must use some distinction, and say that the Creatures may be considered in a threefold acceptation; either as ways that lead us to our last end; and thus they ought to be loved: or as nets which stay us on the earth, and thus they ought to be shunned: or as Instruments which Divine Justice makes use of to punish us withal, and thus they ought to be reverenced: for when the Creatures lead us unto God, that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press

coldness thereof resist fire, fire would ere this have reduced all into ashes, and having no further fuel to nourish it, it would have consumed it self; our humors which are nothing but tempered elements preserve us by their natural Antipathies; and Choler would have dried up our whole body, were it not perpetually watered with flegm; so as the great and little world consist only by the contrariety of their parts; and if the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor which hath produced them, should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease their difference, he would overthrow all his work, which would cease to love one another, if they ceased to hate their contraries. What is seen in Nature, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in Morality, where the soul hath her inclinations and aversions, to preserve and to defend her self, to fasten her self to things she likes, and to make her keep aloof off from what she likes not. And had not God indued her with these two Passions, she would be reduced to a necessity of suffering all the evils which assail her, not having power to oppose them, or hope to defeat them. Hatred is then as requisite as Love; we should have reason to complain of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if having given us inclinations to what is good, she should not likewise have given us an aversion from the contrary; and if she
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:62020:148"/>
had not indued our souls with as much vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour to shun objects which are prejudicial to her, as to draw near to these that are useful. These two inclinations differ then only in their objects, and to speak exactly, we must say, that Love and Hatred make but one and the same Passion, which chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges name according to their different uses; which is called Love, when it hath a liking to what is good; and Hatred, when it abhors what is evil. Leaving here the first effect of Hatred, which we have already considered, we will now examine the second, and will see what the nature, properties and effects thereof are.</p>
                     <p>Hatred in her birth is nothing else but a meer aversion in us from whatsoever is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto us. 'Tis an antipathy of our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite to a subject which displeaseth it; 'Tis the first impression which a true, or an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing evil makes in the lowest part of our soul, 'tis a wound which we have received from a displeasing object, and it is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of that motion which our Soul makes to keep aloof off, or to defend it self from an enemy which pursues it. She hath this in common with Love, that she oft-times prevents Reason, and shapes her self in our will, not consulting with our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:62020:148"/>
She takes offence at divers things, which are not unpleasing in themselves; and many times one and the same object caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Hatred and Love in two different per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages. Sometimes it so falls out, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the divers dispositions of our minds we like what formerly we have disliked; that which did hurt us, cures us, and becomes the remedy of the evil which it caused: she hath this of different with Love, that she is much more sensible. For Love is oft-times formed in our Souls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are aware; our friends must give us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> notice thereof, and those whose company we keep, must teach us that we do love; we must reflect upon our selves to know this Passion in its birth, and as it is extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delightful, it wounds us so pleasingly as we do not feel the hurt, till by process of time it become an incurable Ulcer. But Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred discovers it self as soon as it is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, because it proceeds from an Object wherein we are only concern'd, as it hurteth us; it makes us suffer in its birth, and from the time that it possesseth us, it becomes our punishment.</p>
                     <p>It is as readily formed as Love, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment serves to produce it in our wills, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the little care we have to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:62020:149"/>
it; It disposeth its flames abroad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the faculties of our Soul; and as the most active of all the Elements, it feeds upon whatever it encountereth; but it hath this of misfortune, that it is not so soon efa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as is Love; when it hath once taken root in the heart, there is no tearing of it out; time which hath produced it, preserves it; and Philosophy is defective of sufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, to cure a man who is affected with this troublesom malady. Religion it self is never more troubled, than when she op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugns so opinionated a passion; &amp; the Son of God seems to have descended upon earth, only to teach us to subdue Hatred, and to pardon our enemies. Neither did he oblige us to this duty, till he had suffered death for his enemies; he believed that to establish so strange a Doctrine, it must be confirmed by his example, authorized by his death, and signed by his own bloud. Thus did he declare war to a passion which hath this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage over other Passions, as that it end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not with our self; it is so dearly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed of by men, as it is their sole enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. It serves to divert them when they are displeased; and though it corrode their Bowels, it gives content to their heart. I have heard of a Princess, who after
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:62020:149"/>
having lost her Kingdom and her Liberty, found comfort in the hatred she bore her enemies; and confessed she was not so much possess'd with sorrow for her past happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as by her desire of revenge. We see fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who having their souls hanging upon their lips, and who being no longer able to live, do yet think how to continue their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred; they leave it as an inheritance to their Children, they oblige them to eternal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and make imprecations against them, if they be ever reconciled to their enemies. In fine, this Passion is immortal, and as it resides in the bottom of the soul, it accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panieth her whithersoever she goeth; &amp; doth not forgo her, no not when she is loosened from the Body. This it is which the Poets (who are the most excellent Painters of our affections) would represent unto us in the persons of <hi>Eteocles</hi> and <hi>Polynices,</hi> who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued their hatred after death, and who went to end the combat in Hell, which they begun on earth; this Passion lived in their bodies deprived of Sense, it passed by a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret contagion into their funeral Pile, and waged war in the flames which were to consume them.</p>
                     <p>But I wonder not that this Passion is so opinionated, since it is so daring; and I
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:62020:150"/>
think it not strange that it continues after death, since it hath made men resolute to lose their lives for love of revenge, and that it makes them find some contentment in death, provided they see their enemies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them therein. For Hatred ceases to be true when it becomes discreet, and we may say a man is not wholly possessed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal, when to spare his own bloud, he dares not shed the bloud of his adversary. When he hath given himself over to the tyranny thereof, he thinks he can never pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase the pleasures of revenge at too dear a rate. And propose whatever punishment you list unto him, he is well-pleased there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal, provided his Passion may be satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Atreus</hi> wisheth to be overwhelmed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ruine of his Palace, provided it fall upon his brothers head, and so cruel a death seems pleasing to him, so as he be therein accompanied by <hi>Theistes.</hi> In short, Hatred is very puissant, since all torments are endured to give it satisfaction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth strange tyranny upon such as it posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, since there is no fault which they are not ready to commit in obedience to it.</p>
                     <p>If the proprieties of Hatred be thus strange, the effects thereof are no less fatal. For as Love is the cause of all generous and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:62020:150"/>
gallant actions; Hatred is the rise of all base and tragical actions. And those who are advised by so bad a Counsellor, are capable of all the evil that can be imagined. Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Paricide, are the ordinary effects of this unnatural Passion. 'Twas this, that made us see in the day-break of the world, that a man might die in the flower of his age, and that one brother was not secure in the company of another. 'Twas this, that found out weapons to dispeople the world, &amp; to ruinate Gods goodliest workmanship. 'Twas this, that making man forget the sweetnes of his nature, taught him to mingle poyson in drinks, to shed humane bloud at Banquets, &amp; to kill under pretence of hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality; 'twas this, that first instituted that fatal art which teacheth us how to murder with method, how to kill men handsomly, and which forceth us to approve of Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, if it be done according to the laws of the world. 'Twas this, in fine, and not ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, which tore up the bosom of the earth, and which sought within the bowels there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of for that cruel Metal wherewith it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciseth its fury. And to describe in a few words all the evils it is cause of, it will suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to say, that Anger is her first Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, Envy her Counsellor, Despair her
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:62020:151"/>
Officer; and that after having pronounced bloudy sentences as Judge, it self puts them in execution as Hangman. 'Tis true, that hatred never comes to these extremities, till it grow unruly; but this unruliness is almost natural thereunto; and unless Reason and Grace labour jointly how to moderate this Passion, it easily becomes excessive. The fierceness thereof is oft-times augmented by resistance; like an impetuous torrent it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrows all the banks which oppose its fury, and when it's forbidden any thing, it believes it may lawfully do all things; therefore the remedy which is ordained for Love, is no less necessary for Hatred; and to heal an evil which becomes incurable by time, early withstandings must be made, lest gaining strength, it grow furious, and be the death of its Physitian, for having been negligent in its cure.</p>

                     <head>The FIFTH DISCOURSE. Of the bad use of Hatred.</head>
                     <p>THough the greatest part of effects produced by Hatred may pass for disorders; and that after having described the nature thereof, it may seem unprofitable to observe the ill use that may be made of it, yet that I may not fail in the laws that I have prescribed unto my self, I will employ all this discourse in discovering the injustice thereof, and I will make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to all the world, that of as many A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions as molest our quiet, there is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any one that is rational. For as all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are the workmanship of God, and bear in their Foreheads the Character of him that produced them, they have quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which render them lovely; and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which is the principal object of Love, is so natural unto them, as it is not to be separated from the Essence; to cease to be good, they must cease to be; and as long as they have a subsistance in nature, we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to confess, that there remains some
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:62020:152"/>
tincture of goodness in them, which cannot be taken from them without an absolute annihilation. Thus God gave them his approbation when they were first made; he made their Panegyrick after they were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated; and to oblige us to make much of them, he hath taught us by his own mouth that they were exceeding good; so as the Belief of their goodness is an Article of Faith in our Religion; whatsoever opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they may have to our humors, or our inclinations, we ought to believe that they have nothing of evil in them, and that their very qualities which hurt us, have their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, and their use; Poysons are ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable for Physick; and there are certain maladies which are not to be cured but by prepared poyson; Monsters which seem to be errors of nature, or ordained by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which cannot do amiss; they do not only contribute, by their ugliness, to heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the beauty of other creatures; but are presages, which advertise us of our misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and which invite us to bewail our sins; the very Devils themselves have lost nothing of their natural Advantages; and the malice of their Will hath not been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to destroy the goodness of their essence; and though they are compleated in evil,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:62020:152"/>
they cease not to possess all the good which purely appertains unto their nature;<note place="margin">Nulla pugna est sine malo, cum enim pug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur, aut bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num pugnat &amp; malum, aut malum &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum: aut si duo bona pugnant inter se, ipsa pugna est magnum ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, <hi>Aug.</hi> l. 5. contra <hi>Iulian.</hi> c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore 'tis that hatred seemed useless, and that to exercise it, a man must go out of this world to seek for creatures which may be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his indignation; for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, neither in Heaven nor in Earth, which is not lovely; if we meet with any thing which crosses our inclinations, we must at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute it to our ill humor; or else we must
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:62020:153"/>
blame sin for it, which having disordered our will, hath given it irrational antipathies, and forceth it to hate the workmanship of God. I know there are natural aversions between insensible creatures, and that it is no little wonder, that the worlds peace is caused by the discord of the Elements: If their bodies of which all other bodies are compounded, had not some difference amongst them, Nature could not subsist; anh 'tis Gods will that their warfare be the worlds quiet; but to boot, that their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels are innocent, and that they set not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one another, to destroy, but to preserve themselves; their Combats are caused through their defaults, and their bad intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence proceeds from their being imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; for those other bodies which are more noble, and which natural <hi>Philosophers</hi> call <hi>perfectè mixta,</hi> do not wage war, they cease not to love; though they have different inclinations, and they oft-times use violence upon themselves, that they may not trouble the worlds tranquility; whence I infer, that if a man bear a dislike unto his neighbour, he ought to blame his own misery; and confess that his hatred is an evident proof of his defaults; for if he could reconcile the particular differences of others, he
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:62020:153"/>
would love in them, what he should find in himself; and he could not hate that in their persons, which he should observe to be in his own; but he cannot tolerate their advantages, because he himself is not Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster thereof; the bonds which Nature hath prescribed unto him, close him in within himself, and separate him from all others. If he were an universal good, he would love every particular good; and if he were indued with all the perfections that are found in all men, he would find none that would contrary him; but he is unjust because he is poor, and his aversion takes its original from his poverty; God suffers not these unfortunate divisions, his infinite love cannot be bounded;<note place="margin">Diligis enim omnia quae sunt, &amp; nihil odisti eorum quae fecisti <hi>Sap.</hi> c. 11.</note> as he is the <hi>sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum bonum,</hi> he loves all things that bear any badge of goodness; as he gathers up within himself all these perfections, which are disperst abroad in his workmanship, he cherisheth them all together; and he hath no aversion, because he hath no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults. Hatred is then a weakness in our nature; a proof of our indigence; and a Passion which a man cannot with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son employ against the handy-works of God.</p>
                     <p>Self-love is the secend cause of its dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order;
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:62020:154"/>
for if we were more regulate in our affections, we should be more moderate in our aversions; and not consulting with our own interests, we should hate nothing but what is truly odious; but we are so unjust, as we judge of things only by the credit we bear them; we condemn them when they displease us; we approve of them when they like us; and by a strange blindness, we esteem them good or evil, only by the satisfaction or displeasure which they cause in us; we would have them change qualities according to our humours; that like Camelions, they should assume our colours, and accommodate themselves to our desires; we would be the Center of the world, and that all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures had no other inclinations, than what we have. The fairest seem ugly to us, because they are not pleasing to us; we are offended with the brightness of the Sun, because the weakness of our eyes cannot to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate it; the beams of Virtue dazle us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that virtue condemns our defaults, &amp; truth (which is the second object of Love) becomes the object of our indignation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she censures our offences: there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of truly glittering, but her light; she discovers all the beauties of nature, which

must find out some objects upon which it may innocently discharge its fury; but since nature loves her workmanship, since this common Mother bears an affection to all her Children, and that she keeps them in so good a correspondency, as that those who violate it, pass for Monsters; Hatred must likewise bear a respect unto them, and must go out of the world to find a Subject which may provoke its indignation; it must fight with the disorders of our soul, and must charge such enemies, as would destroy Virtue; yet must it take great heed lest it be deceived by appearances, and that thinking to do an act of Justice, it commit not parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide; for good lies oft-times hidden under the bark of evil, and things seem evil un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, because they are contrary to us; their contrariety is notwithstanding a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; that which thwarts our humour, may agree with the humours of others; and what is not pleasing to our eyes, contribute to the beauty of the Universe; This diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of affection makes it appear, that the evil which we hate, is rather imaginary than true; and that we must rather lay the fault upon opinion, than upon nature.

when it is assaulted by enemies, she takes up arms, and grows cholerick, to defend it; when it is parted from her, she is afflicted, and suffers her self to be over-born with grief; when it is absent, she consumes her self in wishes, and chargeth her desires to go find out an object, the far distance whereof causeth all her anxieties (for Desire is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els but the motion of the soul towards a good which she already loveth, but doth not as yet possess; she extends her self, that she may arrive at it; she endevors to forsake her body, and to separate her self from her self, that she may join her self to what she seeks after, she forgets her own delights, that she may not think of any thing save her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved object; she forceth her self to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Nature and Fortune; and in spite of them, to render present the absent good which she desires.</p>
                     <p>By this Definition, it is easie to observe the proprieties of Desire; the first whereof is restlesness, which will not suffer the soul, which hath conceived it, to taste any true contentment; for this soul is in a violent condition; she fights with the body which she inanimates, that she may unite her self to an object which she loveth; Nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains her in the one, and Love carries her to

Thus have we seen men, who to free themselves thereof, have voluntarily condemned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to fearful punishments; and who have esteemed all remedies pleasing, which could cure so vexatious a malady. Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is certainly one of the cruellest pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, which Justice hath invented to chastise the guilty; it separates us from all we love, and seems to be a long Death, which leaves us a little life, only to make us the more miserable. Notwithstanding we have heard of a Mother,<note place="margin">Inventa est mulier, quae pati maluit exilium, quam desiderium. <hi>Sen.

Thus Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which saw that Desire was an affliction, ordained Hope to sweeten it; for whilst we are upon the earth, we make no wishes, whereof our mind doth not promise us the accomplishment; these two motions of our soul are only divided in hell, where divine Justice hath condemned her enemies to frame Desires void of hope, and to languish after a happiness which can never befall

                     <p>If it be thus cruel, it is not much less shameful; and we are obliged to confess, that it is an evidence of our weakness and indigency; for we never have recourse to wishes but when our power fails us; our desires never do appear, but when we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not effect them; they are marks of our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, as well as of our love; it teacheth Kings upon earth, that their will exceeds their power, and that they would do many things which they cannot.

Desire then is the honour of beauty, and the shame of the unchaste; it is the glory of Riches, and the Avaritious mans infamy; the praise of dignity, and the Ambitious mans blame; and as oft as Princes are prone to this Passion, it gives us to know, that their fortune hath more of glittering in it than of real truth; that she gives not all the contentments she promiseth, since they are constrained to descend from their Thrones, to quit their Palaces,<note place="margin">

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:62020:164"/>
nor to forgo his repose, to seek for content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his creatures; the world contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes nothing to his greatness: if the worlds place should be supplied by a vacuity, and that there were no Angels nor men to know and love him, his felicity would be no whit the less intire; and all the praises which we now give him, add nothing to his glory; when we offer sacrifices unto him, when we make the earth resound with the noise of his praises, when we burn Incense upon his Altars, and enrich his Temples with the spoyls of our Houses, we are bound to protest, that all our Presents are of no use to him, that he obligeth us in accepting them, and that we offer up nothing to his greatness, which we have not received from his liberality; Desire is then a mark of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and whatsoever creature wisheth, declares its poverty.</p>
                     <p>But not to dishonour this Passion totally, we must confess it is also a proof of our dignity, for it extends it self to all things, and pretends some right to whatsoever can enter into our imagination; it seeketh out effects in the bosom of their Causes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades it self it may aspire unto whatsoever may be conceived, and that it may add un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the number of its riches, all the goods

These disorders have no other rise, than the capacity of our heart, &amp; the infinity of our desires, which pursuing the good which solicits them, and finding none that can satisfie them, go always in search for new ones, and never prescribes any bounds unto them; for though our understandings be not sufficiently enlightned to know the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme truth in all his extent, and that our wills have not force enough to love the <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> as much as he is lovely, yet the one and the other of them cease not to have an infinite capacity, which all the things of the earth cannot fill: a natural truth, how elevated soever it be, serves but as a step to our understandings, whereby to raise us up yet to an higher truth; &amp; a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted good, how rare soever it be, doth only enlarge our heart, and dilate our will to make it capable of what is yet more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; so do our desires perpetualy change ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,

                     <p>THose who would take the people for Judges in this Affair, would doubtlesly imagine, that there is no more solid, nor more harmless pleasure in the world, than to see our desires changed into effects, since it is the ordinary wish which our friends make for us; and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if all their wishes were well regulated, nothing would be more pleasing nor more useful to us than their accomplishment, and we should have reason to think our selves happy, if after a long pursuance, we should at last accomplish them; but as they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most always unjust,<note place="margin">Bonae animae male precan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, &amp; si vis foelix esse, Deum ora, ne quid tibi ex his quae op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantur, eveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at. <hi>Senec.</hi>
                        </note> their success is oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times prejudicial to us; and for my part, I am of <hi>Seneca</hi>'s opinion, and hold with him, that the greatest part of our friends do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently wish us ill, and make vows in our behalf, which are most pernicious to us, than the imprecations of our enemies; If
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:62020:167"/>
we will be content, we must pray to God, that nothing may befall us that is wished unto us: our very Parents contribute to our misfortune through an excess of affection, and during our infancy, they draw down the anger of heaven upon us by the unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their desires; so as we must not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if when we are further advanced in years,<note place="margin">Iam non ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miror si omnia nos à prima pueritia mala sequntur: Inter execrationes parentum cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vimus. <hi>Sen</hi> Ep. 60.</note> so many misfortunes befall us, since those that love us best have been the causers of it.</p>
                     <p>There are three causes for the irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our desires; the first is self-love, which not being able to eface out of our Souls, the inclination which we have to the <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> doth turn it aside after such good things as are perishable, and maketh them to be wish'd for, with as much ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie as if they were eternal; for our heart longs always after God; though the good desires thereof be weakned, they are not quite stifled, they betake themselves to what is good; &amp; sin hath not been able to bereave them of an inclination which is natural un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; but Reason which ought to rule them, being clouded with darkness, they mistake, and fasten themselves to all objects that are pleasing to them. Man seeks after a beauty which time cannot alter, which age

                        </gap>o be satisfied. He longs after a good which puts an end to all his miseries, which frees him from all his cares, and which cures him of all the evils that oppress him; when he is falsly perswaded by opinion, that Gold is a Metal which assisteth us at all our needs; which opens the gate to Honour, which facilitates the execution of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, and which makes us triumph over all difficulties; he commands his desires to purchase a good unto him, from whence he expects all his happiness: In fine, man seeks after a solid and true Glory, which serves as a recompense to virtue, and which satiates him with honour, which cannot be efaced by time, nor injured by back biters; when error hath once perswaded him, that Battels are Heroick actions, that conquests are the businesses of Soveraigns, he orders his desires to go in quest of these glorious occasions; and to undertake unjust wars, he forms designs to throw down Towns, to ruine States,<note place="margin">Tantum mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere vitia de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideriis noli. <hi>Sen</hi> Ep. 119.</note> and to carry horror and death into all the parts of the world, that he may look big in Story. The remedy to all these
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:62020:168"/>
evils is easie; and since the Will hath not lost all her good inclination, there needs no more than to clear the understanding, &amp; to fortifie it by solid reasons, which it may op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to the false maxims of the world.</p>
                     <p>The second cause of the irregularity of our desires, is Imagination, which only makes use of its advantage to irritate them; for they would be regular enough, did not this embroyling power put them in disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Nature seeks only how to free her self from incommodities that molest her,<note place="margin">Ad legem Naturae rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamur, divitiae paratae funt: Aut gratuitum est quo egemus aut vide, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem &amp; aquam Natura desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derat; nemo ad haec pauper est <hi>Sen.</hi> Ep. 25.</note> she requires not magnificence in buildings; and provided they save her from being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by the ayr, all their adornments are of no use to her; she wisheth not for pomp in apparel, provided they hide her naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and that they fence her body from the rigour of the Cold; she is yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent enough to blame the disorder; she seeks not after excessive pleasure, in what she eats or drinks, provided they sustain life, and allay hunger and thirst; she values not the delicacies which accompany them; but Imagination, which seems to have no other employment, since the corruption of our Nature, than to invent new delights, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend us from our ancient misfortunes, adds dissoluteness to our desires, and makes our
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:62020:168"/>
wishes irregular;<note place="margin">Luxuria ebore sustineri vult, purpura vestiri, auro tegi, terra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> transferre, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria concludere, flumina praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitare, nemora suspendere. <hi>Sen.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Delra.</hi> c. ult.</note> she adviseth us to enclose fields and rivers within our Parks; she ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth us to build Palaces more glorious than our temples, and greater than our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers Towns; she employes all Artificers to cloath us, she makes whole nature labour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o satisfie our pride, she dives into the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails of the earth, and into the depths of the Sea, to find out Diamonds and Pearls to deck us withal. In fine, she seeks out Delicates in food, she will have no Viands which are not exquisite; she misprizeth what is common, and will try unknown Cates; she awakens the appetite when it is asleep, she confounds the seasons to afford us pleasure, and maugre the heat of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, she preserves Snow and Ice, to mingle with our Wine. In a word, Imagination makes us wise in our coveted delicates, she instructeth them to wish for things which they did not know; and putting our natural desires out of order, she makes them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit excuses, which they are only guilty of in being obedient to her. Thus our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries arise from our advantages, and we are more irregular than beasts, only in that we are more enlightned; for <hi>Aristotle,</hi> distinguishing between our desires, terms (by a strange fashion of speech) the most
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:62020:169"/>

                           <hi>Arist.</hi> Ethic. c. 11.</note> because they are common to us with Beasts, and the most insolent reasonable, because they are proper and peculiar to our selves. In my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 'tis for this cause, that <hi>Philosophers</hi> reduce us to the condition of Beasts, and that they have propounded nature unto us for example, believing her to be less irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar or unruly than Reason; 'tis for the same reason, that they have divided our desires, into necessary &amp; superfluous; and that they have affirmed the one to be bounded, the other infinite; that such as were necessary would find wherewithal to content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in banishment and solitariness; and that the superfluous would not find where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to content themselves in Towns and Palaces.<note place="margin">Ambitiosa non est fames, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenta desinere est, quo desinat non nimis cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. <hi>Sen.</hi> Ep. 119.</note> Hunger is not ambitious, she requires only meat which may appease her; all those several services, in preparing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of so much care is had, are the punishments of Gluttony, which seeks out means how to provoke Appetite, after it is satisfied; for she complaineth, that the Neck is not long enough to taste meats, that the stomach is not large enough to receive them, and that natural heat is not ready enough to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest them; she likes not wine, unless served in costly vessels; nor can she resolve to take
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:62020:169"/>
it, unless prepared by a fair hand. But na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural desires are not accompanied with all these distastes; we are almost always plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with what is absolutely necessary for us. And Nature which is a good Mother,<note place="margin">Inter reliqua, hoc nobis na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura praestitit, praecipuum, quod necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tati fastidium excussit. <hi>Idem ibidem.</hi>

                     <p>The third cause of their disorder is, our not sufficiently considering the quality of the things which we desire; for we oft-times corrupt the nature of desire, &amp; by extream violence we force it to seek out a thing which it ought to shun; We only look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on objects, as they appear; we betake our selves indiscreetly unto them, not conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their defaults; and make our desires be succeeded by sorrow, and grief to be the sequel of our delights; We wish for real evils, because they have some shadow of good; and when after a long pursuit, we possess them, they begin to be unsupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; changing opinion, we change our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and accuse Heaven of having been too easie to us in granting them; We know
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:62020:170"/>
by experience, that there be Vows, which God doth doth exact at our hands, unless he be angry, and that we make wishes, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment whereof is fatal to us;<note place="margin">Attonitus no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitate mali, divesque mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serque, effuge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re optat opes, &amp; quae modo viverat, odit. <hi>Ovid.

                     <p>Prophane <hi>Philosophy,</hi> desirous to find out a remedy to so many evils, gives us counsel which makes us despair; for she will have us to moderate our desires, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reforming our Soul, she inhibits us the use of wishes, as if the mischief lay only in them, and adviseth us to wish for nothing, if we woul be happy; she builds her felicity
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:62020:170"/>
in the cutting off of this Passion. She thinks to have pronounced an Oracle, when by the mouth of <hi>Seneca,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Qui desideri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um iuum clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit, cum Jove de felicitate contendit. <hi>Sen.</hi>
                        </note> she says, that he who hath bounded his desires, is as happy as <hi>Iupiter</hi>: and that without increase of riches, or addition to delight. If we would find a solid contentment, we need only lessen our desires. But certainly in flattering us, she abuseth us; and promising us an Imaginary happiness, she bereaves us of the means how to come by a true one: For she leaves us in the indigency wherein sin hath plac'd us, and forbids us the use of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires: she leaves us with the Inclination which nature hath endowed us withal, for the <hi>Summum bonum</hi>; &amp; will not suffer us to seek after it; she will have us to be poor, and yet to have no feeling thereof; and that to the misfortune of poverty, we add the like of insolence and pride. When we shall reign in heaven, and shall find our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect happiness in the fruition of the <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> we shall banish all wishes. But as long as we grovel upon earth, and that we suffer evils which inforce us to seek for remedies, we shall conceive just desires; and shall learn from religion, how to make use of them, to the glory of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and salvation of our own souls.</p>

                     <p>Nature hath endowed us with desires, only to come by the good which we have not, and which is necessary for us; they are help in our need, they are the hands of our will; as those parts of the body labour for all the rest, our desires take pains for all the Passions of our Soul, and by their care ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige our Love and Hatred: but this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage would be prejudicial to us, if, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given us to assist our poverty, we should make use thereof to increase it: Therefore before we engage our selves in the pursuit of a good, we must be well assured, whether it be great enough, or no, to inrich us; and if

the enjoyment thereof will cause those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to die, to which the want thereof gave birth; for if it do only irritate, and if in lieu of healing our evils, it make them worse, a man must be mad to continue the desire.

The <hi>Stoicks</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy is too austere to be listned unto, their maxims tend more to make us despair, than to instruct us; for it absolutely inhibits us the desire of such things as we may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft of; and it employeth all its sophistical reasons to perswade us, that the good which we come by by our desires,<note place="margin">Alienum est quicquid op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tando venit. <hi>Sen.</hi>

                     <p>But the chief use we ought to make of so noble a Passion, is, thereby to raise us up to God, and to make thereof a glorious chain to fasten us inseparably to him; as he is the only object of Love, he is also the only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of desires; they miss of their end when they keep aloof from him; they lose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, when they seek not him; and they stop in the midst of their course, when they come not full home to him.

since they have wings which raise us up to God, and chains which fasten us to him. Upon all other occasions desires are useless, and after having made us Long, a long time, they furnish us not with what they made us hope for; they torment us whilst they possess us; and when despair causes them to die, they leave us only shame and sorrow, for having listned to so evil Councellors. I know very well that they awaken the Soul, and that they endue it with vigor to compass the good which it wishes for; but the good success of our undertakings depends not upon their efficacy; and should the things that we love cost us nothing but desires, all ambitious men would be Kings; all covetous men rich; and we should hear no Lovers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the rigors of their Mistresses, or of their infidelity; women would take their Husbands from their Graves, Mothers would cure their sick children, and captives would regain their liberty; we should do as many Miracles as make wishes, and all mischief would be banish'd from off the earth, since men can wish; but experience shews us, they are for the most part impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and that their accomplishment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the supream providence, which

                     <p>NAture would have failed us at our need, if having endued us with Love to good things, she had not furnished us with desire to seek after them. These good things which now are cause of our happiness, would cause all our punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if being permitted to love them, we should be forbidden to wish for them: the <hi>Summum bonum</hi> would only serve to make us miserable, and the virtue which it hath to attract hearts would contribute to our misery, if we wanted a capacity of atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it. We should have equal reason to complain of her charity, if having imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our hearts the hatred of evil, she had not likewise engraven therein that Passion which we call Shunning, or Eschew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to make us keep aloof from it; for we
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:62020:176"/>
should see our enemy, and not have the power to defend our selves from him; we should have an aversion from vice, yet should be enforced to tolerate it; and by an unfortunate necessity, we must give lodging to a guest we should not be able to love; but Nature hath well provided for this, and her providence, which always watches over her children, hath given us a Passion which es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chews evil with as much impetuosity, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire seeks after good. This keeps at distance from all that can hurt us; and following the inclinations of hatred, whereof she is either the Daughter or Slave, she flies from all objects that displease her; and fights to defend it self against her enemies: 'tis the first succour we have received against evils; 'tis the first violence, the first salley which the concupiscible appetite makes to free us from them.</p>
                     <p>Though this Passion be almost alwayes blameless, and that she cannot be made cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal but by surprizal; yet ceaseth she not to have her ill use, and to be every day em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd against the design of Nature. Those therefore that would make use of her, are bound to consider, whether that which they endevor to eschew, be truly so, or be but so in appearance; and whether opinion, which
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:62020:176"/>
easily seizeth upon the understanding, hath not perswaded them unto falshoods instead of truths. For it is apparent, that of two things that bear the name of evil in the world, there is but one of them which may properly be said to deserve it. Sin and Punishment are the two most ordinary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of eschewing; and most men do so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found them,<note place="margin">Homines flagella sua do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, pecc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We shun the Plague, and seek out sin; we keep far from all infected places, the bad air whereof may work an alteration in our health, and we draw near to evil compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which may rob us of our innocency: Religion obligeth us not withstanding to believe that Punishments are the effects of Divine Justice; that they have Beauties, which though austere, ought not to be the less pleasing; that God honours himself by punishing of his enemies, and that he finds as much satisfaction in chastening the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as in recompencing the just. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Saints have known that our punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were favours, which did no less con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the welfare of man, than to the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:62020:177"/>
glory of his Creator; they have confessed that we must adore the arm which hurts us, love the wounds because of the arm that made them; <note place="margin">Justissima scias essa illa fulmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, quae per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussi etiam co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunt. <hi>Seuec.</hi> Consolat ad <hi>Polyb.</hi>
                        </note> and teach all the world that Heavens Thunders are just, since those who are therewith struck, adore them; but sin is a true evil, which hath nothing in it which is not odious; its object is a soveraign good which it offendeth; and if in the behalf of the committer, the malice thereof be boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on his behalf against whom it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, it is infinite.

In truth, Choler agrees easily with Love; and Lovers quarrels serve only to re-kindle their extinct flames Hope entertains their Affections; and Joy oft-times takes its rise from their displeasures; so as Virtue can only make use of Eschewing, to defend her self; and of so many Passions which assist her in her other designs, she is only se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by Eschewing, in her combate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

<pb n="307" facs="tcp:62020:179"/>
may the better know a Passion which doth us so many good Offices. She is the same to Hatred, which Desire is to Love; though she seem to consider Evil only, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent she may keep aloof from it; yet seeketh she after good in all parts; and like to Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termen, she turns her back towards the place where she would be: her effects are as powerful as those of Desire; and those unfortunate people who keep far from a great danger, have no less trouble in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than those who seek after a great good fortune. As Desire calls in Hope to her succour, to compass the good which she esteems too difficult; Eschewing imployes the aid of Fear, to acquit her self of an evil which surpasseth her power. As Desire is a mark of our indigence, Eschewing is a proof of our weakness; and as in Desiring, we obtain that which we want; by Eschew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we overcome that which sets upon us. In fine, as Desire doth dilate our heart, and make it capable of the good which it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoureth; Eschewing by a clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effect, doth close up our Soul, and shuts the door upon the Enemy which would force her. So as these two Passions are the faithful handmaids of Hatred and Love; and as Love undertaketh nothing of
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:62020:180"/>
generous, without the assistance of Desire; Hatred doth nothing of memorable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assisted by Eschewing; and as we owe the possession of good to Desire, which sought after it; we owe our escaping of Evil, to eschewing, which hath given it the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse.</p>

the farther off doth not diminish his heat; yet are their certain parts in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens where his aspects are more favourable, and his influences more benign; there be constellations which he cherisheth, and in which he delighteth to oblige whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; they seem to heighten his lustre, to augment his force, and he appears never to be more powerful, than when he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates with them. Morality, which knows no other Sun than Love, confesseth that he takes new force as he takes new counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; for though he be always himself, and that the different names that we give him, do not change his Essence, yet he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodates himself to the apprehensions of our Soul which he employeth, and doth with them produce more extraordinary, or more common effects. He is cloudy in sorrowfulness, violent in choler, ready in desire, undertaking in boldness, calm in joy, and droops in despair; but certainly, he is never more pleasing; than in Hope. 'Tis the Throne wherein he appears with most pomp; 'tis the affection wherein he works most strongly; 'tis the Passion wherein he most smoothly flattereth us; so is it also the most generous motion of our Soul. Nature seems to have ordained it to assist great men
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:62020:181"/>
in their highest enterprize; and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of memorable can be effected without the assistance of this Passion. 'Twas at her solicitation that <hi>Alexander</hi> undertook the conquest of <hi>Asia</hi>; distributing all the wealth that he had received from his father, he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received her for his patrimony; and he who found the world too little, contented himself with the promises which Hope gave him. <hi>Caesar</hi> consulted only with her, when he resolved to change the state of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Common-wealth, and to make himself master of that haughty Queen which gave Kings to all the people of the Earth; all Conquerors have been her Slaves; and Ambition which commanded over them, neither drew forth Forces, nor took advice but from Hope, which augmented their Courage.</p>

The Husbandman doth not culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the ground, Merchants put not to sea, nor do Souldiers give battel, but when so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited by the sweets of Hope. Though she

have no warrant, and that all her promises be uncertain, she sees a thousand people fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her orders, and attend her recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. She hath more subjects than all the Kings of the earth put together; and she may boast, that neither the one nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do any thing but by her advice. 'Tis she alone that contents all men, and who in the difference of their conditions makes them expect the same success. 'Tis she that promiseth the Labourer a happy harvest, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable winds to Mariners, Victory to Souldiers, and to Parents obedient children. Every one is ready to engage himself upon her word; and that which is yet more strange, men believe her though they have tane her in a lie; she gives so many colours to her new promises, as upon the assurance thereof men form new enterprizes,<note place="margin">Ad ea accedl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, de quibus bene speran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum esse cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimus.

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:62020:182"/>
and promise unto themselves that Fortune will grow weary of always favouring one side. In fine, there is no so unfortunate condition, which receives not comfort from this Passion; though she be a Cheater, she will appear to be faithful; and even in her lightness she gives proofs of her constancy; for she accompanies her slave, ev'n to death; she follows Gally-slaves to the Gallies; she enters Prison with the Prisoners, she goes upon the Scaffold with the guilty, and with what bad success soever she may have paid our desires, no man can resolve to abandon her.</p>
                     <p>But as there is no advantage in the world which is not mingled with some defaults, Hope wants not hers; and if she flatter men by her sweetness, she astonisheth them by the fear which accompanieth it. For the good which she purchaseth is absent and difficult; the absence thereof disquieteth her, and the difficulty astonisheth her: She knows very well that what she seeks after, is doubtful; her very name teacheth her, that the event of her undertakings is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;<note place="margin">Spes incerti boni nomen est. <hi>Sen.</hi> Ep. 10.</note> and as oft as she considers the dangers that threaten her, she grows pale, as well as fear: she seems to be of the humor of that great Commander, who always trembled

This Maxime is so true, as that a certain Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher was of opinion, that our apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons sprung from our hopes; and that to cease to fear, we must cease to hope; for, though these two Passions seem to have a contrariety, and that the soul which hopeth is full of assurance, yet doth the one of them arise from the other; and, notwithstanding their ill intelligence, they go hand in hand, and seldom part;<note place="margin">Quemadmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum eadem catena &amp; cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stodem &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litem copulat, sic ista quae tam dissimilia sunt, pariter incedunt, Spem metus sequitur; nec miror ista sic ire, utrum<expan>

                     <p>When she hath not this unhappiness, and that the knowledge of her strength assures her of good success in what she takes in hand, she falls into another extremity; and furnisheth our enemies with means to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize

us; for she is naturally inconsiderate, whatever good advice be given her; she hath an eye unto the good which attracts her, and considers not the evil which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virons her; she throws her self indiscreetly into danger, and guiding her self only by appearances which deceive her, she enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth her liberty to satisfie her inclination. Thus we see fishes swallow the hook,<note place="margin">Et fera &amp; pis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, spe aliquo oblectante de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitur. <hi>Sen.</hi> Ep. 8.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause 'tis covered with some bait; thus we see wild beasts give against the toils, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to find some prey there; and Souldiers fall into an Ambush, thinking to get some advantage. So as, Hope is a rash Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, which in the obscurity of what's to come, sees only false lights, and discovers no apparent good, save only to throw us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hidden and real evils: Therefore do Polititians always distrust her advices; and those great men who govern States, do not easily believe a Passion which hath more heat than light, and more courage than wisdom. But say she should make good all that she promiseth us, and that the good fortune which she makes us expect, should not be mingled with any displeasure; yet should we have reason to complain of her; since that in feeding us with what is to come, she makes us forget what is past, and
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:62020:184"/>
obligeth us to build our contentment on the the most uncertain part of our life.<note place="margin">Memoriae mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimum tribuit, quisquis spei plurimum. <hi>Sen.</hi> Benef. l. 3. c. 4.</note>

                     <p>Time, which measureth all things, hath three differences; the Past, the Present, and the Future: the Present is but <hi>punctum</hi> (a point;) it runs away so fast as there is no staying of it; we are tane in a Lie whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we speak of it: it never understands the beginning and ending of the same dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course: when we think to make use of it for a witness, or to alledge it for an Example, it escapes our hands; we find it is no longer Present, and that it is already Past. The Future succeeds it; but it is so hidden, as the wisest men of the world cannot discover the first moments thereof; the darkness of it is so thick, as that the light of wisdom cannot dissipate it: the success of things are shut up in the Abyss thereof; and one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come to the knowledge of them upon smaller terms than entring into eternity: a man must be a Prophet to penetrate its se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets; and all is there (in respect of us) so doubtful and so confused, as the days which we destine for triumph, are oft-times destin'd for our defeat; and we reserve for our Pastime, those which Heaven hath ordained for our punishment. The time Past is no more; it flies us, and we flie it;

our wishes, which have somewhat of claim to what is to come, pretend none to this; they cannot dispose of that which hath no further a being; and that soveraign power which all things obey, will undertake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon this part of Time, save when the said power will new-mould the world; and drawing our bodies from out the dust, will render unto the present that which the past had taken from it.

the remainder of our life, have none at all over that which is past: the Passion thereof is peaceful; and let the Destinies do what they please, they cannot rob us of a good which we enjoy only by remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance; yet Hope deprives us of these harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less riches; and busying her self only about what is to come, she hinders us from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon what is past; she makes us poor, to enrich us; she takes from us a certainty, to feed us with uncertainty; and by an unjust extremity she draws us out of a calm, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us in a storm.</p>
                     <p>I confess that Wisdom and Religion have an eye to what is to come, but they consider it not as doth Hope; for Religion doth not ground her self upon that uncertain futurity which amuseth most men, but upon an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured futurity which we are promised in the holy Scriptures; she labours to compass it, she employs all her reasons to perswade us, that it ought to be the chief object of our desires;<note place="margin">Nolite ergo soliciti esse in Crastinum.

True wisdom considers the time to come, rather as a well-spring of evil than of good; and when she will seek into the obscurity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, she takes advice rather of Fear than of Hope;<note place="margin">Quam stultum est aetatem dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that Hope is too blame to engage us in a time which is not in our disposal, and to ground all our good fortunes upon moments and hours, which peradventure the course of our life will not arrive unto. I know very well that the condition of our nature obligeth us to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend some right to futurity; that there being none, but God alone, which possesseth all his good together, we must allow some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the succession of Time; and that
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:62020:186"/>
having so few present advantages, we may entertain our selves with those which futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity promiseth us; but we must not build our welfare thereupon; and 'tis a high piece of folly to forgo the present, to forget what is past, and only feed upon what is to come.</p>
                     <p>By all these good and bad effects of Hope 'tis easie to know her nature, and to make an exact definition thereof. 'Tis then a motion of the irascible appetite, which with ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy seeks after an absent, difficult, possible good. She hath this of common with all Passions, that she is a motion of the Soul; but she differs from Fear, in that she consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders only what is good, not what is bad; from Joy, in that she looks upon an absent, not a present good; from Desire, in that she seeks not absolutely after good, but after such as is difficult. All these qualities teach us, that she may have her good and her bad uses; that if young people abuse her in their pleasures, old men make good use thereof in their affairs; and if she be pernicious to Wisdom, when she leaneth indriscreetly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the uncertainty of what is to come, she is useful to Religion, when she grounds her self upon Eternity. We shall see the proofs of these truths in the ensuing Discourses.</p>

                     <head>The SECOND DISCOURSE. Of the evil use of Hope.</head>
                     <p>PAssions cannot be more insolently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused, than when they are employed contrary to the design of Nature; or when, thwarting their principal proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they are made to serve unworthy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, who either by cunning, or violence, make them forgo Virtues part. I cannot therefore more evidently shew the ill use which most men make of Hope, than in letting them see that they give against her inclinations; and that diverting her from her legitimate object, they propose others unto her which are not so fit for her. For according to the reason of all Philosophers, this Passion ought to respect a good which is Absent, Difficult and Possible: whence I conclude, that the riches, honors, or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of life, cannot be her true objects, since they have only an appearance of good; and that it is Opinion, which knows not well how to name things, that hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor'd
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:62020:187"/>
them with a title which they deserve not: for Reason teacheth us, that all these things have no other valuation than what either Ignorance or Falshood gives them.<note place="margin">Aurum nomen terrae in igni relinquit, at que exinde de tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namenta, de suppliciis in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licias, de igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniis in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nores metalli refuga muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Tert.</hi> De habitu mulieb.</note> Before such time as Avarice had rent Gold from out the entrails of the earth, and that by a thousand tortures which she had made it suffer, she had given it the colour that dazles our eyes, it past only for an useless sand. Honour depends so strongly upon O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, as it is her meer workmanship: and Virtue would be thought to be very mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, had she no other Recompense, than what is most commonly given to such crimes as have either good success or lustre. The Pleasures of life are not innocent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and they are too pernicious to man, to be numbred among his good things: Shame and Sorrow accompany them; Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row which they so carefully eschew, finds them always out, and makes them bear the punishment of all the excess which they have committed. 'Tis peradventure this which makes the Wise-man term these imaginary goods, deceitful Pictures, which are in effect nothing less than what they appear unto our senses;<note place="margin">Umbra pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae, labor fine fructu. <hi>Sap.</hi> 15.</note> for those who judge of the workmanship of Pictures only by the eye, think they see birds flying in the ayr,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:62020:187"/>
Plains at such a length, as the eye reacheth not their extent, and Personages which stand at distance from the cloth; yet when they draw nearer, they find them but as stroaks of a Pencil which deceive their senses, and which make them see things that are not. It fares thus with all those perishable goods which Opinion hath cry'd up, and which owe all their valuation either to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or to the ignorance of men. They are but the shadow of good, which having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of solidity, cannot be the objects of Hope: the wisest men have therefore dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist them; and there have been Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, who have never better known the vanity thereof than in their pomp &amp; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>

                     <p>If riches, not being a real good, cannot be the object of our hope, whatsoever else the world promiseth us, cannot satisfie it, since they are not far enough off. For this Passion looks far into what is to come: she neglects present things, and longs after what is absent, and builds her felicity upon a happiness which is not as yet come. It seems she would teach us, that the world is not her resting place, and that all those content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which smooth our Senses, and which charm our eyes or ears, are not those which she seeks after. She raiseth her self up to Heaven, and pretending to Eternity, she thinks not that absent which is closed up in the un-intermitted course of Time; she, by a generosity which cannot sufficiently be praised, doth undervalue all those greatnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, of which imagination may form an

Those then injure her who force her to fasten her self to all that we esteem good, and to languish for Objects, which have not any one of those conditions that hers ought to have. For to boot, that her object ought to be absent, it must be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, and such as may cause trouble to those that will seek after it. This Epithete will cause an error to arise in most minds, and men finding difficulties in the pursuit of such things as they wish for, will imagine that they deserve to be hoped for: the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous man, who crosseth the Seas, who goes to discover unknown Lands, and to seek out new maladies under new Climates, will perswade himself that riches are very well worth the wishing, since they are so hard to come by: the Ambitious man, who enjoys not one hour of content, and who finds a thousand real Hells in the imaginary Paradise which he frames unto himself, will think that Honour is the only object of Hope. But Philosophy pretends to fix dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to greatness; she confounds the name of difficult, with that of noble and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, she blames all those that labour after
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:62020:189"/>
an infamous good; and who forgetting the nobleness of their birth, have desires only after such things as are despicable. Hope is too couragious to value smoak or dirt; and she pities all those mean Souls, which take such might pains to compass riches or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. 'Tis true, they cause trouble enough to those who seek after them; but they are not the more to be wished for, for their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; the pain which they are accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with makes them not the more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; they resemble the punishment of the guilty, which cease not to be infamous, though severe.</p>
                     <p>In fine, all that the most part of men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, is not Hopes end, because it is, for the most part, impossible. For though this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion be bold, yet is she wise; she measures her strength; and though she engage her self in glorious enterprizes, she will have some assurance of success: she aspires only to what she may obtain, and she quits the pursuit as soon as she finds they surpass her power; she loves to be esteemed Reserved rather than Rash; and to confess her impotency, rather than to shew her vanity. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, all those that hope exceed these bounds; and bereaving this Passion of her natural wisdom, they raise their desires

beyond their merits, and do oft-times la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after things equally unjust and impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible: a slave in Irons promiseth himself li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; a guilty person under the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans hand hopes yet for pardon; a man that is banisht from the Court,<note place="margin">Spes est ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum terum so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latium. <hi>Sen.</hi> 5. controv. 1.</note> pretends yet to government; and you shall hardly find any so miserable, who do not indiscreetly feed themselves with some imaginary hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness: they perswade themselves that the heavens will do miracles for their sakes, and that they will change the order of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, to fulfil their desires.</p>
                     <p>But of all these mad mad men, there are none more to be pitied than old men; who seeing death already pourtray'd in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, do yet promise unto themselves a long life; they lose every day the use of some part of their body; they see not but by art, they hear not without difficulty, they walk not without pain, and in every thing that they do, they have new proofs of their weakness, yet they hope to live; and because our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers lived many ages, they believe that in having a care of themselves, they may fence themselves against death; and after so many sins that they have committed, taste a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour which hath not been granted save to such as had not as yet lost all Innocence.

                     <p>CHristian Religion is wholly built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Hope; and as she neglects present happiness, we must not wonder if she long after a felicity to come; she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth she is not of this world,<note place="margin">Scit se pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grinam in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris agere, inter extraneous facile inimicos inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire: Caete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum genus, sedem, spem, gratiam, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatem, in coelis habere. <hi>Ters</hi> in <hi>Apol.</hi>

All Christians who are instructed in her School, do with a holy impatience expect the happy day wherein the Son of God will punish his enemies, and crown his Subjects. They think themselves already saved, because they are so in hope; and amongst so many evils that afflict them, they solace themselves in this virtue which promiseth much, but gives more: for it never confounded any body; and though she suffer such as lay claim to her to
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:62020:191"/>
be persecuted,<note place="margin">Spes non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundit, quia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundit certitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem; per haue enim ipse spiritus testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monium perhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet spiritui nostro quod sumus filii <hi>Dei. Bern.</hi> in <hi>Cant.</hi> 37.</note>, she inspires them with so much courage, as that far from resenting their sorrows, they cast the happiness of Angels amidst their punishments, and laugh at the cruelty of Tyrants and Hang-men: let whatsoever accidents befall them, they are always secure; and knowing that Jesus Christ is the foundation of their Hope, they look upon all the changes of the earth, with calmness of mind.</p>
                     <p>But whatsoever advantage Christians may draw from the virtue, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that she hath nothing to do with that Passion which considers the time to come, and which seeks out a good which is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and difficult; for the one is a Christian Virtue which resides in the Will; and the other is a Passion which resides in the sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive appetite; the one is a meer effect of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the other is the pure work of Grace: the one by its one strength can extend but to some ages, the other by its proper vigor mounts even to eternity; the one, in brief, makes not good all that it promiseth, and failing in her word, leaves her lovers in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion and sorrow; but the other is so faithful in her promises, as those who have sought under her banners, confess, that her recompenses surpass all their services; yet
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:62020:192"/>
in these their differences nothing hinders them from agreeing: the best use of humane Hope is to assubject it to divine Hope, and to make it aspire, by her assistance, to the Possession of eternal happiness; for though Passion know no eternity, and that being engaged in the body she raiseth her self not much higher than the Senses, she hath yet some inclination to follow after Grace, and to suffer her self to be guided by her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: as she obeys Reason, she may obey Godliness; as she is useful to Moral Virtue, she may be useful to Christian Virtue; and (if it be not to give her too much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage) I should think, that as she inter meddles with Patience and Fortitude to frame Moral habits;<note place="margin">Fortitudinem Gentilium mundana cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piditas, fortitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anorum Dei charitas facit, quae diffusa est in cordibus nostris, non per voluntatis arbi, rium, sed per spiritum sanctum qui datus est nobis. <hi>Aug.</hi> l. l. oper. imperf. cont. <hi>Iul.</hi>
                        </note> she may do the like with Hope and Charity, to form super-natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral habits. But without engaging my self in a School-dispute, it shall suffice me to say, that if all our Passions may be sanctified by Grace, Hope being of no worse condition than the rest, may pretend unto the same fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and contribute to all the good works of a Christian.</p>
                     <p>Neither do I doubt but that the Saints have made good use thereof, and that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by Faith, they have placed all that hope in Jesus Christ, which they placed in
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:62020:192"/>
their Kings, or in their gods, whilst they lived in Paganism. I doubt not but that this generous Passion which encouraged them in dangers for the glory of their Princes, did animate them amidst flames for the quarrel of the Son of God; and I am firmly of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that as by her own forces she made them good souldiers, so assisted from above, she made them couragious Martyrs; for Nature is the ground-work of Grace; and as Faith presupposeth Reason, the fortitude of a Martyr did presuppose the hope of a man; and it behoved that Passion should work in the hearts of those generous Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>st Grace wrought in their Wills. God makes daily use of the mouths of his Prophets to explain his Mysteries; when he discovers to them secrets to come, he makes use of their words to declare them unto his people; and he accords Nature with Grace in them, to execute his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes.</p>
                     <p>I therefore think that the best use a man can make of Hope, is to assubject it to three Christian virtues, which may make good use of her heat: the first is that which bears her name, and which by a harmless piece of cunning, loosens her from the earth, and gives her desires for heaven; for though
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:62020:193"/>
humane Hope be so generous, yet cannot she pretend to the happiness of eternity; and though in the souls of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Caesar,</hi> she aspired to divine honours, it hath not proceeded so much from any motion of her own, as from the like of vain-glory; but when she is instructed by faith; when she knows that God hath chosen us to be his children, and that Jesus Christ hath made us his brethren, that we may be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heirs with him, she wisheth with Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for what the others wisht for out of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. The second Virtue which she may be serviceable unto, is Patience; which in all the evils she undergoes hath no other comfort, than what Hope furnisheth her withal; for while she fights with grief and pain, she would be a thousand times opprest by their violence, did not this glorious Passion point out unto her the Rewards which are prepared for her; and if she did not sweeten the present evil by future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness which Hope promiseth her. To un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand this, you must know that Patience is a Virtue as mild as close; she hath nothing of lustre; and though she undertake great matters, she spares Pomp and the Theater; darkness and the desarts are pleasing unto her, and she is content to fight in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:62020:193"/>
by whom she expects to be crown'd: neither is she any ways given to use vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and, though her enemies be so powerful, she defends her self by suffering, and makes us win the victory by the loss of our lives; she hardly takes the liberty to complain, and she shews so little feeling of outrages done unto her, or of her sufferings, as those who do not know her,<note place="margin">Spes patientiae anima. unde B. <hi>Iacob.</hi> illas confundit, dum dicit, patientes estote fratres, usque ad ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventum Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini: Ecce Agricola ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectat pretio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum fructum terrae <hi>&amp;c. Iac.</hi> cap. 5. Quae quidem patientia spes almixta, aut potius innixa videtur.</note> accuse her of stupidity. So great a coldness ought to be animated by the heat of Hope; and so mild a virtue requires the assistance of an active Passion. During all her displeasures, the recompenses which are promised her do only possess her, and in the sorrows which she suffers, she raiseth her self up to heaven upon the wings of Hope; and with the eye of Faith, seeth the happiness which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for her.</p>
                     <p>But the chief use which we ought to make of this Pashon is, when Fortitude grapples with grief, and when she sets upon these dreadful enemies, which endeavour to triumph over her Courage. For there is this difference between Patience and Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; the first is content to suffer; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond will be doing; the one, out of modesty, hides her self; the other, out of generosity, shews it self; the one expects till mischiefs
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:62020:194"/>
come, the other goes to seek them out; the one is mild, the other severe; the one (to speak properly) suffers pains which she cannot shun; the other endures torments which she easily might eschew. But amongst all these differences, they have this of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that they cannot subsist without Hope:<note place="margin">Tolle spem hominibus, nemo victus retentabit ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma; nemo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feliciter exper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus negotiatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem alios ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petet quaestus: nemo naufra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus vivet. <hi>Sen.</hi> controv. 1.</note> 'tis the soul which gives them life, and these two bea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiful virtues would not attract the eyes of men and Angels, were they not encouraged by this Passion which regards futurity.

                     <p>Both these opinions are equally unjust, and do violate the Sense of Nature; for let the disaster be what it please, which For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune threatens us withal, and whatsoever

great mishap she prepareth for us, we never may attempt against our own life: our birth and our death depend only upon our Lord God, and none but he who hath brought us into the world, can take us out of it; he hath left unto us the disposal of all the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our life, and hath only reserved to himself the beginning, and the end; we are born when he pleaseth, and we die when he ordaineth it: to hasten the hour of our death, is to intrench upon his rights; and he is so jealous of it, as he oft-times doth mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, to teach us that it belongeth unto him. But if Despair be forbidden us upon this occasion, there are many others where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is permitted; and I am of opinion, that Nature did never more evidently shew her care over man, than in enduing him with a Passion which may free him from all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils for which Philosophy hath no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
                     <p>For though Good be a pleasing Object and that by its charm it powerfully attracts the Will, yet it is sometimes environed with so many difficulties, that the Will cannot come nigh it; its beauty makes her languish, she consumes away in Desire, and Hope, which eggeth her on, obligeth her to do her utmost in vain: the more she hath of
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:62020:196"/>
Love, the more she hath of Sorrow; and the more excellent the good which she seeks after, is, the more miserable is she; that which ought to cause her Happiness, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioneth her punishment: and to speak it in few words, she is unfortunate, for that she cannot forbear loving an object which she cannot compass. This torment would last as long as her Love, did not Despair come in to her succour, and by a natural wisdom oblige her to forgo the search of an impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility; and to stifle such Desires as seem only to afflict her.</p>
                     <p>As this Passion takes us off from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of a difficult good which surpasseth our power, so are there a thousand occasions met withal in mans life, wherein she may be advantageously made use of; and there is no condition how great soever in the world which needs not her assistance. For mens powers are limited, and the greater part of their designs are impossible; Hope and Boldness which animate them, have more of heat than government; led on by these blind guides, they would throw themselves headlong into <hi>Praecipices,</hi> did not Despair withhold them, &amp; did not she by her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their weakness, divert them from their rash enterprizes; she is also a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:62020:197"/>
Counsellor which never doth deceive us, and which deserves not to be blamed, if, not being sent for till our affairs be in a sad condition, she gives us more wholsome than honorable advice; we must accuse Hope, which engageth us too easily in a danger; and praise Despair, which finds a means to free us from it.</p>
                     <p>The greatest Princes are only unhappy, for not having listned unto her; for would they measure their forces before they undertake a war, they would not be enforced to make a dishonourable peace, &amp; to take the law from their victorious enemy: but the mischief is, they never implore De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairs assistance, but when she cannot give it them; and they never advise with this Passion, till all things be reduced to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity: yet is she not unuseful at such a time, and her counsels cease not to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, though precipitate. For when Princes know that their forces are inferiour to those of their enemies, and that all the advantage lies on the enemies side, Despair wisely managed causeth them to retreat; and this Passion repairing the faults of Hope and Audacity, makes them keep their souldiers till another time, when they may assuredly promise themselves the victory
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:62020:197"/>
for Despair is more cautious than couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and aims more at the safety than glory of a Kingdom; it makes use of the evils which it hath observed, and thinks it self glorious enough,<note place="margin">Arimus ex ipsa desperatione sumitur: igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vissima anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, quae natura ad fugam ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuit, ubi exitus non paret, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant fugam corpore imbel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li Nullus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicior hostis est quam quem audacem an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustia faciunt.

'Tis true, that when it sees all ways of safety barred up, and that it is on all sides environed by death, it chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the most honourable; and recalling Hope which it had chased away, resolveth either to die or overcome. Therefore 'tis, that good Commanders do never put the vanquished to Despair; but knowing that this Passion becomes valiant when provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, they make her bridges of gold, open all passages to her; and suffer this Torrent to disperse it self abroad in the open Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, lest her fury swelling by resistance, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear such works as are opposed to her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuosity. Herein the nature of Despair is strange; for it ariseth from Fear; and its greatest wisdom consisteth in its timorous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; in the good which it offers it self, it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther considereth the difficulty which may astonish, than the glory which may attract; and be it, that it be more cold, or less coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous than Hope, it hath not so much an eye to good, as to bad events; yet when the danger is extream, and that the mischief is
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:62020:198"/>
so great as it cannot be evaded; it makes virtue of necessity, and gives battel to an enemy, which Hope it self durst not assail; it oftentimes plucks the Lawrel from out the Conquerors hand; and performing acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which may pass for miracles, it exceeds Nature, it preserves mens lives in making them contemn them, and wins the victory by seeking after an honourable death.</p>
                     <p>By all these effects it is easie to judge of the nature of Despair, and to know that it is a violent motion by which the soul keeps aloof from a difficult good, which it thinks it cannot compass, and by which likewise it sometimes draws near unto it; rather to shun the evil which threatens it, than to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess the difficult good; for in its birth De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair is fearful, and hath no other design, than to divert the soul from the vain seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after an impossible good; but in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress it becomes bold, and when it sees that by keeping aloof from a difficult good, it engageth it self in an infamous evil, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes courage, and employs all its power to gain a thing which it thought assuredly to have lost; so as this is not a single Passion, &amp; to explain the nature thereof well, we must say, that she is mixt of Fear and Hope; and that, as in the beginning she is more faint-hearted
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:62020:198"/>
than the former, she is in the end more generous than the latter. But at both these times she hath need of government; &amp; that she may be serviceable to Virtue, she must shun two dangerous extreams which bear her name, and stain her glory; the one may be called Faint-heartedness, the other Foolhardiness; she falls into the former, when not knowing her own strength, she keeps at distance from a good which she might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass; she falls into the second, when not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding her own imbecility, or the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the danger, she undertakes an impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilty, and engageth her self in a design which cannot have any good success. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Reason to govern her, and to see when she may eschew without infamy, and when she may charge without rashness: if it be a lawful good, which may with Justice be expected, it must seldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be despaired of; upon such an occasion Opiniatrecy is commendable; and a man is not to be blamed who attempts even an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility, to purchase a happiness which his duty requires him to seek after: but if that which he wisheth for, be hard to come by, and perishable, he must cure himself of his vain desires, and foolish <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

this Passion be in Nature oft-times inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, she is always guilty in relation to Grace; for nat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ral hope being grounded upon our proper forces, it is lawful to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go her, to embrace Despair; and there is nothing of inconvenience, that man whose misery is so well known, do quit his designs when he cannot compass them; but super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural hope being grounded upon divine power, we must not forgo her; and it is a capital fault to suspect God of falshood or of weakness. Those therefore who despair of their souls health, justle his highest perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and make themselves unworthy to receive pardon of their sins, from the time they cease to hope; for since the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture teacheth us, that God is good, and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powerful, those who perswade themselves, that he either will not, or cannot save them, commit outrage against his Power and Goodness; and by one and the same fault give against his two most excellent qualities: and if we will believe St. <hi>Austin,</hi> they who despair imitate proud people, and make themselves equal with God, by lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the hope of their salvation; for when they fall into despair, they imagine that Gods Mercy is not so great as their sin is, and by an injurious preferrence, they raise
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:62020:199"/>
their wickedness above his goodness;<note place="margin">Adhuc cum diffidit, &amp; suam nequitiam comparat Dei benignitati, finem imponit virtuti Dei, dans finem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finito, &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionem au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferens Deo, cui nihil deest, etiam quod cogitari non potest. <hi>Aug.</hi> 1.

                     <p>True it is, that if Despair be faulty in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Grace, there is an excess of Hope which is not much less dangerous; and there are certain Christians in the Church, who are opinionated in their sins, only out of a confidence they have of Gods Mercy: they make use of his goodness only to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure him; they think not of his favours to sinners, save to abuse them; and by irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal consequences, which Philosophy can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have taught them, they conclude that they ought to be wicked, because God is good, and that we ought to offend him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he doth not punish his enemies: had not these shameless sinners lost their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment together with their Piety, they would argue after another manner, and say; That since God is good, man must be obedient; that since he is prone to forgive, man ought to have a care how to offend him; and that since he loves the welfare of man, man ought to love his Honour. But certainly, if they had not these just considerations, Gods mercy should not maintain in them their foolish confidence; for to boot, that his

Mercy agrees with his Justice, and that the one doth not intrench upon the others rights, he hath so temper'd his Promises with his Threats in the holy Scripture,<note place="margin">Propter illos qui desperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one periclitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, proposuit indulgentiae portum; prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eos vero qui spe peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clitantur, &amp; dilationibus illuduntur, fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit diem mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis incertum. <hi>Aug.</hi> l. 3. <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:62020:201"/>
fight against whatsoever is most terrible in the world; for though Hope be generous, and that she be not pleased with what is good, unless it be auster; yet doth the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof invite her to seek after it, and the charms thereof endue her with strength to overcome the difficulties which surround it; but Audacity wants this assistance, and considers an object which hath nothing in it of lovely, she sets upon evil, and coming in to the aid of Hope, she denounceth war to her enemies, and proposeth no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compense in the combat, but glory; she is of the humour of Conquerors, who leave all the booty to their Souldiers, reserving on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the honour to themselves.</p>
                     <p>For all those that describe her nature, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in this, that she is a Passion of the Soul which goes in quest of dangers, to grapple with them; and overcome them; she may therefore be termed a natural Fortitude, and a disposition to that generous Virtue which triumphs in sorrow, and in death; as she undertakes nothing but what is difficult, she is more severe than pleasing; a certain severity may be seen in their countenances whom she inanimates, which sufficiently shews, that her delight lies in troubles, and that she hath no other pastime, than what she
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:62020:201"/>
takes in overcoming Sorrows; nothing comforts her but Glory; nor doth any thing nourish her but Hope; with this weak succour she assails all her enemies, and gains almost as many victories as she fights battels.</p>
                     <p>But to afford this Discourse more light, we must know, that good and Evil are the two objects of all our Passions; Love con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders Good, and employs Desire and Hope, to obtain it: sometimes the Good proves so hard to be come by, that Love through Despair forgoes it, thinking it a piece of wisdom, to renounce a happiness which cannot be obtained. Hatred detests Evil, and to withstand an enemy which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares perpetual war with it, she employs such Passions as hold of her Empire; she makes use of Fear, and of Eschewing, to keep from it; and sometimes she employs Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Choler, to fight with it and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it; but as Despair would never forgo a difficult good, did not Fear perswade that the difficulties which attend it cannot be overcome;<note place="margin">Quid sunt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae spei, sunt audaces <hi>Arist.</hi> lib. <hi>Ethic</hi> c. 8.</note> Audacity would never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to set upon a dreadful evil, did not Hope promise her the victory; so as these two Passions cease not to be of one mind, though they have different objects: though
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:62020:202"/>
the one seek after what is good, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther provoke what is evil, they both labour for the quiet of the mind, and by several ways endeavour the same end. The truth is, the condition of the one is much more sweet than is that of the other; for Hope hath only a respect to the good which she desires; if sometimes she cast her eye upon the difficulties which surround it, 'tis rather out of necessity than inclination; and if she hazard her self upon some danger, 'tis not so much out of glory, as out of profit; but boldness considers only what is evil, and by a certain confidence which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies her in all her designs, promiseth her self to overcome it by her own strength. Hope doth easily engage her self; and being as light as vain, she undertakes all enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes which she judgeth to be glorious and feasible; but she would thereby reap no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Confusion, did not Audacity come in to her aid; and by the greatness of that Courage which is natural to her, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily execute that which her companion had rashly undertaken: Hope resembles the Trumpets which sound the Charge, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enter into the scuffle: Audacity contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise, is of the nature of those Souldiers who are silent, and keep all their forces to
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:62020:202"/>
fight with the enemy: Hope promiseth all things, and gives nothing, and abuseth men with fair words, which are not always fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by good effects; but Audacity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth nothing, and performeth much; she attempts even impossibilities to make good hopes promises; and endeavours to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the difficulties which hinder the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution thereof. In fine, she is so generous, that her designs, though they be difficult, cease not to be fortunate; and she is so accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to overcome, as the Poets, to give some colour to her victories which she wins contrary to the Laws of war, have feigned that she hath a Divinity which encourageth her, and that her Deeds are rather Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous than Natural.</p>
                     <p>But to the end that these differing quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may the more evidently appear, I will add Examples to Reasons, and make it known by certain remarkable Histories, how much Daring is more considerable than Hope.

and that the other nourisheth her self with real pain: 'Tis true, the latter finds her contentment in her duty, and sings trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly in the midst of her defeat; for though she bear not away the victory over the <hi>Persians</hi> in the person of <hi>Leonidas,</hi> she carries it sheer away over the fear of death; and she is sufficiently contented to have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the violentest of all her enemies:<note place="margin">Non est quod me victum, te victorem cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, vicit fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na tua fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam meam. <hi>Sen.</hi> De cons. sap c<hi rend="sup">.</hi> 6.</note> she is not troubled for being beaten by men, provided she may overcome Fortune; and good success is to her indifferent, so she may vanquish the apprehension of danger.</p>
                     <p>If it be permitted to add Fiction to Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, we shall see the divers motions of those two Passions, in the person of <hi>Iason.</hi> The purchase of the golden Fleece is the subject of his journey: Hope makes him put to sea, and promiseth him fair winds, which shall fill his sails, and bring him in despite of tempest, to the Coast of <hi>Colchis</hi>; she shews him how all <hi>Greece</hi> have their eys fixt upon him; and that she hath no Commander who in this expedition will not fight under his Ensign; that in so noble an enterprize profit is joyn'd to glory, and that the recompense which he may expect, is as rich as honorable; but Audacity which cannot flatter, lays be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him Souldiers which he hath to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:62020:204"/>
Monsters to tame, and a Serpent which always waketh, to surprize; yet he accepts of all these conditions, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to assail all these enemies upon confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his own forces; he is not sure to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the Bulls and Serpents which he shall meet withal; but he is very well assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to overcome Fear; he knows that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess depends upon Fortune; but he knows also that Boldness depends only upon Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; it sufficeth him to set at naught all these Monsters, which present themselves before him under such dreadful visages, and without any further recompense, thinks himself glorious enough, if he can triumph over Fear.</p>
                     <p>By these two examples, the advantages which Audacity hath over Hope, are easily discerned; but in their oppositions some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of resemblance may be found; and the same Causes that make us hope for good, seem to make us despise evil; for youth, which abounds in heat, imagines nothing impossible; &amp; because her vigour gives her assurance, she easily engageth her self in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and glorious designs; good success doth likewise feed this Passion; and when Fortune smiles upon Commanders, they do not greatly refuse to fight; though their
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:62020:205"/>
forces be inferiour to those of the enemy, they perswade themselves that their very name is able to affright them; and being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to overcome, they cannot fear a misfortune which hath not yet befallen them. Power contributes no less than good success to make men bold; for when a Prince commands over a great State, when every Town furnisheth him with an Army; when the Revenues are such as will afford him to entertain them divers years; when his neighbours fear him, and that he hath no more to do to make them his subjects, but to march into the fields; he shuns not the undertakings of any war, nor ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairs of Victory. But of all things in the world, nothing makes a man more bold than innocence;<note place="margin">Qui bene se habent ad di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vina, audacio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res sunt. <hi>Arist.</hi> l. 2. <hi>Rhetoric.</hi> cap 5.</note> for though the enemy that assails him be powerful, and that the earth fight in favour of him, he imagines that God ought to take his part, and that he who protects the innocent, being interessed in his Cause, is bound to defend him; so as he marcheth undauntedly amidst dangers, dreads no ill success; and expecting help from heaven, promiseth unto himself assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Victory. The one and the other of these Passions may be mistaken; and as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come glorious Virtues, when they are gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:62020:205"/>
by Prudence; they may degenerate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to shameful vices, when they suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be governed by Indiscretion: this is that we will examine in the ensuing Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses.</p>

                     <head>The SECOND DISCOURSE. Of the bad use of Audacity or Boldness.</head>
                     <p>AUdacity having no other guide than Hope, we must not wonder if she undertake enemies which she can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not vanquish; and if her desires have, for the most part, ill success; 'tis not likely that rash enterprizes should be fortunate, and that actions which are not governed by Wisdom, should be accompanied by good success: Fortune grows weary offavouring the Audacious; and having oft-times kept them out of danger, wherein they had indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly engaged themselves, she forsakes them with some seeming Justice, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes their Fool-hardiness, to remedy the like in others. All men are therefore bound to weigh well the Counsels which Hope
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:62020:206"/>
giveth them, and to consider their strength, before they follow the motions of Audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for though they be full of Gallantry, and that most souldiers confound them with the motions of Valour, they cease not not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding to be fatal, and to be dayly the cause of the loss of Armies, and ruine of States. But to find the Spring-head of this evil, we must know that the Passions reside in the inferior part of the Soul, and cannot discourse; they only consider their object, and by a blind impetuosity they either draw near unto it, or keep far from it; they do not mark so much as the Circumstances which accompany it; and not comparing the difficulties with their strengths,<note place="margin">Nec audacem quidem timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris absolvimus, nec prodigum quidem avari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia liberamus <hi>Sen</hi> l. 4. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefic.</hi> c. 25.</note> they engage themselves indiscreetly in a war, or shamefully run away; their judgment is so ready, as it is almost precipitate; for after having listned to what the senses say, they advise with their inclination; and not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting orders from Reason, they bear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the whole man, and enforce him to follow their motions. Hence it comes, that he oft-times repents him of his designs, condemns what he formerly approved, and cannot end what he had begun.</p>
                     <p>But of all Passions, none is more unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate than Audacity; for she betakes her self
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:62020:206"/>
to powerful enemies, and she grapples with Pain and Death: Fighting is her ordinary exercise, and she oft-times bathes her self in tears or bloud; she is always encompassed with dangers; and on what side soever she turns, she sees nothing but ghastly images, and fearful apparitions; this mean while she borrows no aid, nor takes no counsel, save only of Hope; and the same that hurries her into danger, is she that counsels her; she who sets her on work, is she who puts weapons into her hands; and who under vain promises engageth her in extream dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties; she also often sees the greatest part of her designs prove abortive, and reaps nothing of all her useless endeavours, but sorrow for having followed evil counsel; oft-times she discourageth her self,<note place="margin">Audaces te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meritate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vecti, ante cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piunt adire pericula quam instant? cum adsunt, ea de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fugiunt. <hi>Arist.</hi> l. 3. <hi>Eth.</hi> c. 2.</note> and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that her undertakings do exceed her strength, she suffers her self to be astonished by Fear, beat down by Despair, and consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Sadness; for these Passions do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most always succeed her; and experience teacheth us that those who at the beginning of a fight have been more couragious than men, have at the end thereof been found more fearful than Woman. The fewel of Boldness soon takes fire, but it is as soon extinguished; and as the fury of waves
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:62020:207"/>
turns into foam, the violence of the Audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous turns into Fearfulness; and for all the confidence they shewed in their designs, all that remains unto them, is Weaknesses, as full of shame as of guilt.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, that Choler sometimes sides with Boldness, and furnisheth it with new forces, when the danger hath made it lose its own: but this assistance is not always sure: the souldier that engages himself in battel upon her weak succours, is in as great danger of losing the victory, as he who puts his hope in Despair; and is no more assured of conquest, than he that fights, only because he cannot retire. Desperate men have been seen to die with their weapons in their hands, and if sometimes they have revenged their deaths, they have not always preserv'd their lives: Bold men have also often been seen, who for being cholerick, have not more luckily evaded the danger whereinto they had precipitated themselves.<note place="margin">Vides fortitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinis matrem esse prudenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, nec forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinem sed temeritatem esse quemlibet ausum quem non parturivit prudentia. <hi>Bern.</hi> De con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider. l. 1.</note> Cholers forces are as well limited as are those of Boldness; and unless the one and the other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The second is, that the motive of Audacity be generous, and that the daring man expose not his life upon a
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:62020:211"/>

The third is to try his own strength, before he set upon the enemy; for Virtue is too rational to engage us in an impossibility; she exacts nothing from us, but what is in our power, and she will have us in all our enterprizes, to observe whether

                     <p>THere are some Passions whose Names belie their Natures, and are nothing less inwardly than what they outwardly appear to be. The name of Hope is pleasing, but her humour is violent; and she is cause of as much evil as she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth contentment: the name of Despair is odious, but her nature corresponds with Reason; and we are obliged unto it, when it makes us forgo the pursuit of a good which we cannot compass. The name of Boldness is glorious; we no sooner hear thereof, but we conceive a greatness of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, which despiseth Pain, and seeketh out Death; but the inclination thereof is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage; and if it be not withheld by Wisdom, it engageth us in dangers which cause much mischief to us, and little glory. The name of
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:62020:213"/>
Fear is contemptible; and errour hath so cried down this Passion, as 'tis taken for the mark of a Coward; but her humor is wise, and if she warn us of our misfortunes, it is to free us from them. For Nature seems to have given us two Passions to our Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors in the divers adventures of our life; Hope and Fear; the first is doubtless the more pleasing, but the second is the more faithful; the first flatters us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us; the second frightens us to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us; the first imitates those inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>essed Counsellors, who in all their advices have respect rather to the Fortune than Person of their Prince,<note place="margin">Ne tum fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Principis potius loquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur quam cum inso <hi>Tacit.</hi> 1. in Histor.</note> and who by a dangerous flattery prefer his contentment before the welfare of his State; the second resembles those faithful State-Ministers which disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a mischeif that they may cure it, and who stick not to anger their King a little, to purchase him a great deal of glory. In fine, the first is oft-times useless; and the number of what is good being small enough, she hath not many employments; and if she undertakes any thing which belongs not to her, she makes us lose our labour and our time; the second is almost always busied; and the number of evils being infinite, she is never out of exercise; she looks far into
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:62020:213"/>
what is to come, and seeks out the evil which may happen, not to make us misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before the time, as she is unjustly accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, but to secure our happiness, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perse all the disasters which may bereave us of it.</p>
                     <p>For Fear is a natural Wisdom which oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times frees us from danger, by making us apprehensive thereof; she spreads her self over all the actions of our life, and is no less useful to Religion than to a Common-wealth: if we will believe prophane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, 'tis she that made the gods;<note place="margin">Primus in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be deos fecit timor <hi>Stat.</hi>
                        </note> and though there be some impiety in this Maxim, a man may notwithstanding ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve some shadow of Truth in it; for 'tis the fear of eternal punishment which perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded men they were to appease the incensed gods; 'tis she that hath made Sacrifices, builded Temples, set up Altars, and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Victimes; 'tis she that keeps the Just within their duties, and which after a fault committed makes them lift up their hands to heaven, and witness their sorrow for it. Though men talk of generosity in Religion, and boast that they are won rather by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises than by Threats; yet it must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that Fear hath sav'd more guilty people than Hope; so is she termed in the holy

Often doth she convert Libertines; and by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiveable miracle, she perswades them unto truths, which they would not have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, lest they should be obliged to fear them she stings even the most opinionated;
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:62020:214"/>
and of as many as acknowledg Jesus Christ, there are few that owe not their Love to their Fear; they endeavour not to gain hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, save to free themselves from hell; and they love Gods goodness only because they fear his Justice. I very well know that this resentment is not pure, and that a man who should stop at Fear would be in danger ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to acquire Charity; but it is much that she opens the gate of Salvation to Infidels, and shews the way of Virtue unto sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>

But though it be usual for this Passion to turn it self into Hatred, yet is she not always per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted so to do, and this change is a sign of her ill nature; there are some whom we ought to fear, and cannot hate, their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness obligeth us to respect them, and their justice forbids us to hate them; that Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty which environs them, produceth fear; but the protection which we draw from thence, ought to make us love them; so as the propensity to Hatred is a disorder in Fear; and to follow her irrational inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is to abuse this Passion.</p>

to mind past evils, though she busie her self about the present, her particular enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment is in future evils, and she useth all her best means, either to keep them far off, or to withstand them; 'tis true, she implores help of Hope, and makes use of the courage thereof to rid her of her enemies; but she more resembles Wisdom, which after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving foreseen a danger, useth the valour of Souldiers to repell it; for men are not so happy, as to possess these two Virtues both together; they require different tempers; and though they mutually assist one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they seem to have protested never to meet in one and the same person: Wisdom is the portion of those old men that are grown white-hair'd in business, and who have spent all their lives in observing the Humours of People, the revolutions of States, and the divers changes of Fortune; Valour on the contrary, is the Portion of young men, who having more Vigour than Experience, are fitter to execute than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate; and succeed better in Combats, than in Counsels. It appertains only to the eternal Word, to be at once both Wisdom and Power; the Arm and the <hi>Idaea</hi> of his Father: but amongst the creatures these qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities are separated; and who hath much

strength, hath but little knowledg; to make these two incompatible advantages meet, Heaven must do a miracle; and it is not more difficult to agree Fire &amp; Water, than to unite Wisdom &amp; Fortitude: It must also be confess'd, that as Fear is fuller of Advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness than of Generosity, she hath like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise more Light than Heat, and is far fitter for Counsel than for Combat. In fine, she is accused in taking things always in the worst sense, and of making evils greater than they are; She resembles (say they) those faint-hearted Spies, which <hi>Moses</hi> sent to discover the Land of <hi>Palestine</hi>; who thought by their false reports to have tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the <hi>Iews</hi> from so noble a conquest: she makes a Mountain of a Mole-hill; all beasts appear Monsters to her, and she thinks all dangers which she sees, inevitable. 'Tis true, she doth almost always judge the worst; and that she may be abused, doth paint out evil in its proper deformity; but surely, in so doing, she remembreth Wisdom the more, which never adviseth of what is to come, without fore-casting all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that may arrive, &amp; without preparing forces to fight with such enemies as may assail her: she doth not consider only what is done, but what may be done; when she
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:62020:224"/>
sees an evil, she will know the progress thereof; and takes some little trouble to procure assured quiet.<note place="margin">Si vis omnem solicitudinem exuere, quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid vereris ne eveniat, even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turum utique propone; &amp; quodcunque illud malum est, tecum me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire. <hi>Sen.</hi> Ep. 24</note> The <hi>Stoicks</hi> have no better expedient to defend themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst an evil that threatens them, than to imagine it will happen, and to withstand it in their minds, that they may have the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it in effect; so as by the judgment of our enemies, wisdom hath no other Maxim than Fear; and this faithful servant moves not, but as her Soveraign doth.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true that as she neighbours upon the Senses, and resides in that part of the Soul wherein combustions are framed, she al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways apprehends trouble; and her judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are almost always accompanied with commotion; but the understanding may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily disabuse her; and by the brightness of its fire, may dissipate the Fogs which rise from the Imagination; it must bind her to consider such objects as she is afraid of,<note place="margin">Tolle istam pompam sub qua lates, &amp; stultos territas: Mors es quam nuper servus meus, quam ancilla con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempsit.</note> and make her the bolder by making her view the cause of her astonishment at a nearer distance; she must take away that Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from Punishments which makes them so dreadful, and those complaints from Grief which make her so eloquent; it must teach her, that under those deceitful appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, there is but a common death which
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:62020:224"/>
Children have endured, which Souldiers have overcome, and which Slaves have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned; the most appearing torments are not always the most violent; a stopping of the Urine is more painful than being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken on the wheel; one troubled with the Gout, suffers many times more pain in his bed, than an offender doth on the Rack; &amp; a man whose head is cut off, endures not so much as he that dies of a Fever; it belongs then to the understanding to perswade fear that all those things which affright us, are not those which harm us; that the greatest appearing evils are not the most sensible, and that those which appear least, are oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cause of greatest pain. Thus will she be fixt against evils; and suffering her self to be guided by Reason, she will have no more apprehensions, than what shall be necessary to keep her from being surprized.</p>
                     <p>But if Fear may be serviceable to us in withstanding Vice, she may be made use of to defend Virtue; and this seems to be the chief end for which Nature hath ordained her: for Shame is nothing but a Fear of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy; and this innocent Passion is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectress of all Virtues: 'tis to her that Judges owe their Integrities, Souldiers their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and Women their Chastity: 'tis by
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:62020:225"/>
her care that Piety is preserved; and all the world must confess, that not any Affection of our soul is more delectable, or useful, than is Shame. Since we owe so much unto her, 'tis reason that we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it, and that we give her the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour she deserves; she carries the colour of Virtue, and that blush which spreads it self over her face, is a mark of her Innocence; but she is so very nice, that the least thing in the world may corrupt her; she is like those Fruits new gather'd, whose verdure is lost assoon as they are handled; she her self de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys her self; she is offended at the praises that are given her; and women are made to lose her by being reproached for her: If she be easie to be lost, she is as hard to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain'd; for though she be of a mild nature, yet she is Stately; and being once banish'd, she is very hardly recalled. Hope doth oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times succeed Despair;<note place="margin">Et qui redire nescit ut periit pudor. <hi>Sen</hi> in <hi>Agamemn.</hi>
                        </note> Joy resumes the place which Sorrow had possest, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Hatred turns to Love; but Shame never appears upon a Face, when once it is driven thence by Insolence and Impudence: as this Passion is a companion to Purity, so is she of her Disposition; the loss of either is irreparable; she so loaths Sin, as she cannot endure the sight thereof; she blushes at the
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:62020:225"/>
very name of it, and she summons in all the bloud of her heart, to succour her in defence of her self against her enemy. But she is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of more might than when she fights in the defence of Virtue; for she doth such mighty things in her behalf, as she always procures her glorious victories; she obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth all the Passions to second her; she sets out guiltiness in so ghastly a manner to them, as she augments their hatred thereof; and so presents Innocence to them so beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful as she augments their love thereof: she awakens Hope, encourageth Audacity, irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates Desire, and enflames Choler; so as it is a Passion that disperseth it self into all other Passions, and which endueth them with new strength to maintain Virtues quarrel: though she be timorous, she encourageth Souldiers; they are only valiant in being Ashamed; and if they despise Danger, 'tis only because they fear Infamy, one fear drives out another; and those who give not way to Valour, suffer themselves to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by Shame: Though she be indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, she makes Judges severe; and when men go about to corrupt them with bribes, or to frighten them with threats, she keeps them within their bounds by fear of Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; though she be Weak, she makes

This Sex hath no other strength than what it borrows from this innocent Passion; it preserves it self only by the fear of Infamy; and who should take this defence from it, would easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave it of all its other advantages. Nature it self, which very well knows it loves Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as well as Virtue, hath perswaded it, that Shame makes it more approved of: in effect, Shamefastness is an innocent paint; women never seem fairer than when they are somewhat shamefac'd; aud there is no face, how taking soever, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth not a fresh lustre from the innocent blush which accompanies Shamefastness; she is so appropriated to Virtue, as men have a good opinion of all them that have her; and she defends the interests of Reason with so much fervency, that the Empire thereof would ere this have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, if this Passion had been banished from off the earth.</p>
                     <p>For experience teacheth us, that more men abstain from sin for Shame, than for Duty; and that the Fear of Infamy hath
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:62020:226"/>
more power over mens minds than the love of Innocence. The Devil therefore very well knowing that this Passion is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse to his designs; and that to make us lose it, our nature must be destroyed, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to perswade us that Virtue is criminal, to the end that it being thought infamous by us, Shame, which always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends her, may be enforced to abandon her: He thought it was easier to take from Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue her estimation, than Innocence from Shame: not being able to corrupt Shame, she hath gone about to deceive her; and to make her lose her aversion to sin, he hath made her believe sin to be glorious. This Errour is so generally dispers'd throughout the whole world, as there are now adays some Virtues which are esteemed Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and some Vices Honourable; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge passeth for greatness of Courage, and forgetting of Injuries for meanness of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; Ambition is illustrious; and because it sets upon Crowns, means to be no longer ashamed; Modesty and Humility are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised; and because they delight in Solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness and Silence, they have lost all their glory. Opiniatricy in a fault, is the mark of a stout spirit; Penitence and Change of life, an argument of Weakness; thus all

To shun this evil, this innocent Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on must be disabused, and giving to every Object the name that it deserves, she must be withdrawn from the error wherein she hath indiscreetly engaged her self; she must be perswaded that the humblest Virtues are most profitable; and that those Vices which are the most Honourable, are the most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: upon these good Maximes she will side with Innocence again; and repenting for having suffer'd her self to be deceived, she will so much the more hotly pursue her enemies, by how much her hatred is aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by their injurious dealing: and for that by defending Virtues interests, she shall likewise revenge her self of her own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Injuries.</p>

Clemency, which makes Kings reign happily, borrows
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:62020:228"/>
her beauties from two or three of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions; she ows her good Government to Prudence; her Mildness to Mercy; and her Glory to Generosity. Valour, which makes Conquerors triumph, holds all her riches from the liberality of all other Virtues; and he that should take from her the stateliness which she derives from Magnanimity, the address which she takes from Discretion, and the Moderation which she receives from Justice, would leave her but a vain shadow of all her real greatness. Though the passions hold not so good Intelligence as do the Virtues, yet are there some of them which never forsake one another; and there are some others which live wholly upon borrowing; and which would be poor, should the rest forgo them. Hope is of this nature, for she hath no other goods than what are given her; and were she for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken by Desire, which eggs her on, by Fear, which holds her in, and by Audacity, which encourageth her, nothing but a bare name would remain unto her.</p>
                     <p>Choler is of the same condition; though she make so much noise, she draws all her force from the Passions which compose her; and she appears not to be couragious, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>From all this Discourse it is easie to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that Choler is nothing else but a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sensitive Appetite, which seeks Revenge for an Injury. <hi>Aristotle</hi> therefore thought she was Rational, and that even in her Fury, she had some shadow of Justice;<note place="margin">Nulli irascenti sua ira videtur injusta. <hi>Aug.</hi> l.

since the love she beareth us, hath obliged her to make Monsters barren, and to allot but short lives to the most furious Beasts, she was bound to affix brevity to Choler, and to allow a short term of time to so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a Passion: nor doth her short time of duration keep her from causing much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; she employs to her utmost those moments which Nature hath given her, and in a few hours commits many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages: for to boot, that she troubles the minds of men, that she changes their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, that she seems to play with their bloud, (making it sometimes withdraw it self to the Heart, sometimes disperse it self over the Face) that she sets the Eyes on fire, and she fills the mouth with Threats, and that she arms the Hands of as many as she meets withal, she produceth much more strange effects in the world; she hath, since its birth, changed the face thereof a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times; there is no Province wherein she hath not committed some spoils; nor is there any Kingdom which doth not bewail her violence: those ruines which have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been the foundations of some goodly City, are the remainders of Choler; those Monarchies that whilome gave Laws to all the earth, and which we know only by

Passion: for when she finds resistance, or cannot easily work her end, she presently slackens, and losing her rage, suffers her self to be guided by Reason; but when she meets with any one that gives himself over to her power, who suffers himself to be born away by her motions; and who hath not strength enough to oppose her violence, she takes the freedom to fly at all; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves that she may promise her self any thing from a slave, who can refuse her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: if she possess the soul of a King,<note place="margin">Perierunt om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, ubi quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum suadet ira, fortuna per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittit. <hi>Sen.</hi> 3.

<pb n="424" facs="tcp:62020:238"/>
that she fights either to come by it, or to keep it; since women who are possess'd with this passion, despise death, to satisfie their desires; and expose themselves to the fury of their Husbands, to please their Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: Lastly, confess, that Ambition is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, since she finds not any honour that contents her, will have all years bear her name, and that all Pens be employed in writing her praises; but certainly all these passions are pusillanimous, what shadow soever they have of Greatness, they are in truth mean and poor; and there is nothing great which bears not reason with it: or, to speak more like a Christian, there is nothing August but what is enlivened by the Grace of Jesus Christ.</p>

<pb n="431" facs="tcp:62020:241"/>
must work wonders, to stifle it; a love which hath not yet past from the Eyes to the Heart, and which is rather a Complacency than a Passion, is as soon quench'd as set on fire; but when 'tis once gotten into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of our soul, that it hath brought its flames into our Will, a long time is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to mortifie it; and unless Hatred, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite, and Jealousie come in to the aid of Reason, she will be perplex'd to triumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so puissant an enemy; but Choler hath all her forces in her Cradle, she is at full growth as soon as formed; and as if she were of the nature of Spirits, she stands not in need of Time to grow in; so as she is hard to overcome, even from the time she begins to fight; and contrary to the humour of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Passions, she is more to be feared in her Cradle, than in her Saddle: she carries her poyson in her Head, as Vipers do; if you think to stifle her when she is once on foot, you augment her fury; and this monster is so wild, that the next way to appease her violence, is, to resolve to bear with her.</p>

two keep it so faithful company, as they never leave it but it costs them their life; for Fear becomes Sadness when 'tis desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Hope; and Hope is changed into Despair, when it is parted from Fear: Love is not satisfied with Revenge; and though Revenge be sweet, yet it is accompanied with pain: In Boldness, it is cover'd with Sweat and Dirt; Glory flatters it, and threatning danger astonisheth it; in Hatred, it is tormented; and the evil which it wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to its enemy, is a Viper that lies gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it: in Eschewing, it wants strength; and it shuns not him that pursues it, save only because it cannot defend it self from him: in Despair, it is vanquish'd; and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up its weapons to the Conquerour, suffers it self to be led in Triumph: in Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness it is miserable; and the remembrance of its fore-past happiness, serves only to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment its present sorrow: but in pleasure, it is at once both Victorious, Triumphant, and Happy; all its Races are stopt, all its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires are accomplish'd, and all its designs at an end. And surely, we must not wonder if it be in so deep a Tranquillity, since it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes the happiness it sought for, and is luckily arrived at the end of all its labours: for Pleasure is nothing else, but the enjoying

                     <p>This definition excludes all such delights as spring only from Remembrance, or from Hope, and which make us happy only in that which we have been, or hope to be: Memory doth not always entertain us with our misfortunes; though she be more faithful in retaining a Displeasure than a contentment;<note place="margin">Habet praete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riti doloris re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordatio dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctationem <hi>Cic.</hi> l. 5.

Hope is not much more favourable to us; for though she fore-run our good fortune, that she anticipate the birth thereof, and that she feeds us with a contentment which is not yet happen'd; though by an impatience which is advantageous to us, she seeks out present felicities in Futurity, and that, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitating the course of years, she advanceth our Contentment; yet a man need not be over-wise, to observe that she deceives us; and that she often makes us miserable, out of a desire of making us too soon Happy: she is found false in her Promises; and after having long expected their effects, all we reap thereby, is Shame, for having been too credulous; and Sorrow, for having grounded our happiness upon an uncertain good: Solid pleasure requires the presence of its object; and though, in Morality, the end hath so much power over our Wills, yet can it not make them happy, but by

possession; therefore is it, that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous and Ambitious, who forgo a present good, only to entertain themselves with a Future; and who consider not so much what they have, as what they want, cannot be esteemed happy; since in the very Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of honour or riches, they are languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and contrary to the nature of Pleasure, they seek for what they have not, and value not what they have.</p>

He instructeth us, that Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures are not only fading, but painful; and that they are not only Unprofitable, but Faulty. In fine, they are the daughters and mothers of Sorrow; and all those which
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:62020:261"/>
promise us the greatest contentment, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist only by the Pain which precedes them. Monarchs triumph not till after the victory; they had not defeated their enemies,<note place="margin">Triumphat vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor Impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; non vicis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set nisi pugnas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set, &amp; quanto majus est gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium in trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho, <hi>Aug.</hi> 1.8. cap. 3.</note> had they not fought with them; and Joy mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sureth it self so justly by Sorrow, that the beauty of the Triumph depends upon the greatness of the Combat; when it hath not been throughly disputed, the pleasure is less, and the glory is not so splendid: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners never taste the sweetness of life more than when they have escaped Shipwrack; and they are never more sensible of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than when after despair of safety, a Tempest drives them upon the shore: an only Son is never so dear to his Mother, as when he hath run great hazards, and hath cost her many a Tear; she thinks she hath been brought a bed with him, as many times as she hath wept for him; her joy ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth from her sorrow; and the contentment of enjoying him would not be so great, had she not fear'd to have lost him: one must be hungry before he take delight in eating; and as nothing sets forth Light better than Darkness;<note place="margin">Edendi &amp; bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendi voluptas nulla est. nisi praecedat esu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riendi &amp; sitien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di molestia. <hi>Ide n Ibidem.</hi>
                        </note> so there is nothing adds more to Pleasure than the Pain that hath gon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it. But out of another consequence, as necessary, &amp; more vexatious, pleasure turns
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:62020:261"/>
to Sorrow; and that wherewith we were at first delighted, in process of time, becomes painful: Too long sleep degenerates into a Lethargy; &amp; the remedy which nature had found out to repair our strength, when it is continual, ruinates it. Excess of meat suffocates the natural heat; too violent exercise weakens our vigour; and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentest Pleasures become Punishments, when they are immoderate.</p>
                     <p>Temperance might cure us of these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, if they went no father; but expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teacheth us, that what passeth for a Pleasure, in the world, is a Sin before God; and that the greatest part of our joys cause sorrow in the Saints. A Souldier rejoyceth in the murders he hath committed; and men, in this corrupt age, call that Valour, which, in more innocent times, would have been termed Cruelty. A lustful person rejoyceth in having stollen away her that he loves; and if he content his Ambition, by satisfying his Incontinence, the more sins he commits, the more pleasures he tastes: A Tyrant rejoyceth in his Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and if he reaps Glory by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice, he thinks himself more happy, than a Lawful Prince: A Cholerick man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth in Revenge; though to obey his
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:62020:262"/>
Passion, he hath violated all the Laws of Charity; he finds Contentment in his Crime; and strangely blind, the more faulty he is, the more happy he thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; So that worldly joy is nothing else, but wickedness unpunish'd, or a glorious Sin.<note place="margin">Saeculi laetitia est impunita nequitia. <hi>Aug.</hi>
                        </note> Therefore, when this passion becomes once faulty, no less than a Miracle is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to restore it to its innocence: For though such desires, as rise up contrary to the Laws of God, are unjust; and that there are punishments ordained in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, for the chastisement of irregular thoughts, yet are these but begun offences; and which have not, as yet, all their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; though fond hopes be punishable, and entertain our vanity, yet are they not always follow'd by effects; and oft-times by a fortunate Impotence, they do not all the evil which they had promised unto themselves; our boldness is fuller of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consideration, than of wickedness; and an ill event makes it lose all its Fervour: Our Sorrows and our Griefs are not obstinate; they are healed by any, the least help, that is given them; and as they are not well pleas'd with themselves, they are easily changed to their contraries: Our Fears are slitting; the evil which caused them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:62020:262"/>
once withdrawn, they leave us at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; and to conclude, in a word, there is no passion incurable, but Joy: But since it hath mingled it self with sin,<note place="margin">Nullum quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet scelus co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram Deo tam abominabile sit quam de peccat is gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere, atque in eis semper ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceae. <hi>Aug.</hi> lib. <hi>De Salutar. Docum,</hi> c. 12.</note> and that corrupting all the Faculties of Nature, it takes delight in evil; Morality hath no remedies more to cure it with; 'Tis a great disorder, when a man glories in his sin; and that, as the Apostle sayes, he draws his Glory from his own Confusion: 'Tis a deplorable mischief, when together with Shame, he hath lost Fear; and that the punishments, ordained by the Laws, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hold him in to his duty; but a strange irregularity is it, when his sins have made him blind; or that he knows them not, save only to defend them; but certainly, when he takes delight in his sin, when he grounds his Felicity upon Injustice, and that he thinks himself Happy, because he is Sinful; this is the height of evil: To pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish this impiety, it is, that the Heavens dart forth Thunders; The Earth grows barren, for the punishment of this horrid disorder;<note place="margin">Omnibus cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men suum vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lupt ati est; lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatur ille adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terio, laetatur ille furto. <hi>Sen.</hi>

who place their contentment in their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and who, violating all the Laws of Nature, do unjustly mingle Joy with Sin.</p>

Therefore, following St. <hi>Augustines</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, (which we cannot suspect, since in the slower of his age, he had tasted the delights
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:62020:263"/>

                        </note> For, sadness seems to be Natural to us, and Joy a Stranger: All the parts of our body may taste Sorrow and Pain; and but very few of them are Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of pleasure; Pains come in throngs, and assail us by Troops; they agree to afflict us; and though they be at discord among themselves, they joyn in a confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, to conspire our undoing; but plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures justle one another, when they meet, and, as if they were jealous of good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, the one of them destroys the other; Our Body is the Stage, whereon they fight; the miseries thereof arise from their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences;
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:62020:264"/>
and man is never more unhappy, than when he is divided by his Delights: Griefs continue long; and as if nature took pleasure in prolonging our punishment, she indues us with strength, to undergo them; and makes us only so far Couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or so far patient, as may render us, so much the more miserable.<note place="margin">Voluptas tune cum maxime delectat extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guitur, nec multum loci habet, it aque cito implet, &amp; taedio est, &amp; post primum impetum mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet. <hi>Sen.</hi> De vita beata c 7.</note> Pleasures, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially those of the Body, endure but for a moment; their death is never far off; and when a man will make them of longer du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, by art, they occasion either tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or loathing. But to make good all these reasons, and to shew that Grief is more familiar to man than Pleasure, we need only consider the deplorable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our life; where for one vain content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we meet with a thousand real sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows:<note place="margin">Scio rem non esse in nostra potestate, nec ulium affectum servire, maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me vero eum qui ex dolore nascitur. <hi>Sen.</hi> Consol. ad <hi>Helviam.</hi> c. 5.</note> For these come uncalled, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent themselves of their own proper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they are linkt one to another; and like <hi>Hydra</hi>'s heads, they either never die, or after death, spring up again: But plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures are sought for with pain; and we are oft-times enforced to pay more for them, than they are worth: Sorrows are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times entirely pure, and touch us to the quick, as they make us incapable of conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; but pleasures are never without

Yet is it the truest of all our Passions; and, if we believe <hi>Aristotle,</hi> it makes the greatest alterations in our Souls; the rest subsist only by our ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; and were it not for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence we hold with this Faculty, they would make no impression upon our Senses: Desires and Hopes are but deceitful good things; and he very well knew their nature, who termed them, the Dreams of Waking men: Love and Hatred are the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions of idle souls; Fear is but a shadow, and it is hard for the Effect to be true, when the Cause is imaginary; Boldness and Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler form Monsters to themselves, that they may defeat them; and we must not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if they so easily ingage themselves in the

I know there are some sorrows that wound only the mind, and exercise all their might upon the noblest part of man; but if they be violent, they work upon the body; and by a secret contagion, the pains of the Mistress become the diseases of the Slave; the Chains that bind them together, are so streight, that all their good and bad estate is shared between them; a contented Soul cures her body; and a sick body afflicts its soul; this noble Captive patiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures all other incommodities which befall her; and, provided that her prison be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from pain, she finds reasons enough to chear up her self with: She despises the loss of Riches; and bounding her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, she finds contentment in Poverty; she neglects Honour, and knowing that it only depends upon Opinion, she will not ground her happiness upon so frail a good; she pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth by Pleasures, and the shame which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies them, lesseneth the sorrow which their loss brings her; as she is not tied to these adventious goods, she easily forgoes them; and when Fortune hath rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed

This Barbarous Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy had some Admirers, but she never
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:62020:266"/>
had any true Disciples: her Counsels made them despair; all that would follow her Maxims suffer'd themselves to be miss-led by Vanity, and could not fence themselves against Grief. Since the Soul hath contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted so straight a society with the Body, she must suffer with it; and since she is shed abroad into all the parts thereof, she must complain with the mouth, weep with the eyes,<note place="margin">Si egregium est hostem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jicere, non mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus tamen laudabile infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licis scire mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reri. <hi>Val.

Wherefore shall we accuse her of Abjectness, if she share in the sorrows that assail it, and which, not being able to hurt her in her own substance, set upon her in her Mansion-house, and revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves on her, in that thing which, of all the world she loves best? For while she is in the body, she seems to renounce her Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and that ceasing to be a pure spirit, she interesses her self in all the Delights, and all the Vexations of her Hoste: his health causeth contentment in her; and his sickness

is grievous to her; the most worthy part suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers in the less worthy; and by a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som necessity, the Soul is unhappy in the miseries of her body.<note place="margin">Devovet ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentes, simula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chraque caerea fingit: Et mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serum tenues in jecur urget acus. <hi>Ovid.</hi> in E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

De Civ. Dei. c. 19.</note> Since Love and Magick work these wonders, we must not marvel, if Nature, having fastned the Soul to the Body, do make the miseries common; and if by one only wo, she makes two Parties miserable; the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of each others Good and Bad, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of their Marriage; and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens must do a miracle, to give them a
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:62020:267"/>
Dispensation from this necessity. The joy of Martyrs was no meer effect of Reason; when they tasted any pleasure amidst their Torments, it must needs be Grace that sweetned the rigour thereof; and he that in the fiery Furnace changed Flames into pleasing gales of Wind, must have turned their Torments into Delights; or if he did them not this favour, he did them a greater; and by making the Soul not sensible of the Bodies sufferings, he taught the whole world, that he was the Soveraign Lord of Nature. But howsoever, all Philosophers agree, that the Soul cannot be happy in a miserable body; and that she cannot endue it with life, without sharing in the miseries thereof; if her noblest part be touched with Joy, while the body languisheth with pain; that which inanimates it, must be sensible thereof; &amp; to pay interests for the services she gets thence, she must be miserable for company: Even the Soul of Jesus Christ, thrice-happy as it was, failed not to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted; and a miracle was done in the order of Glory, that the society might not be broken, which Nature hath put between the Soul and the Body, it is then agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that these two parts that compose man, cannot be separated in their suffering; and
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:62020:268"/>
that the torment of the one, must of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be the others punishment: they love too well to forsake one another in their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and unless the violence of pain break the chains wherewith they are linked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, their miseries must be common: I should moreover think, that the condition of the Soul is more deplorable, than that of the Body; for besides, that to make her subject to sufferings, be to injure her worth, and that it is a piece of Injustice to force her to feel evils, from which by Nature she is exempted; she sentenceth her self to new sufferings; and the love which she beareth to her Body,<note place="margin">Dolet anima cum corpore, cum co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that excess of pain would have made him be of another mind; and that he would have confess'd, that to die quickly, is better than to live long in pain; or had he persisted in his first Opinion, we should be bound to confess, that poorly-spirited men are more wilful, than are those that are couragious; and that the desire of Glory makes not so great impression in us, as the desire of life. But to return to my Subject, when Grief is violent, it loosneth the soul from the Body, and causeth the death of the man: for Sadness and Joy have this of resemblance in their difference, that both of them attempt upon our lives, when they are in extreams: The heart dilates it self by Joy; it opens it self to receive the good which is offer'd, &amp; tastes it with such excess of pleasure, as it faints under the weight

Oft-times also, its negligence makes it miserable; it suffers it self to be surpriz'd by Sorrow, for not having foreseen it; and being no longer in a condition to defend it self, when Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row arriveth, it is forced to give way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
