            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>OPpreſs'd with the inſupportable Calamities of <hi>Civil Arms,</hi> and affrighted at the ſodain fall of a <hi>Licentious Sovereign,</hi> who was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to have been Poyſon'd by a <hi>Monk;</hi> all men ſtood at gaze, expecting <hi>Peace,</hi> (the Event of their long <hi>Deſires</hi>) and <hi>Benefit,</hi> as the Iſſue of their new <hi>Hopes:</hi> Experience telling us that, in every <hi>Shift</hi> of <hi>Princes,</hi> there are very few either ſo Mean, or ſo Inopinionative, as not to pleaſe themſelves with ſome probable Object of <hi>Preferment.</hi> To content all, (<hi>October</hi> 19. 1216.) a <hi>Child</hi> aſcends the Throne, Mild and Gracious, but Eaſie of Nature, whoſe Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and natural Goodneſs protected him throughout the various Perils of his <hi>Father</hi>'s Reign.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94850:4"/>
and no leſs fortunate, for thirty years after, whilſt <hi>Hubert de Burgh</hi> (Earl of <hi>Kent</hi>) that <hi>Faſt</hi> Servant of King <hi>John</hi>'s againſt the <hi>French,</hi> both in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> together with <hi>Bygot</hi> Earl of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and <hi>others</hi> of like Gravity, and Abilities, had the management of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.

            </p>
            <p>Thirty years being now paſt and gone, and none of the old Guides of the Kings <hi>Youth</hi> left alive, but <hi>de Burgh</hi>; (a man in whom nothing of <hi>Worth</hi> was wanting, ſave <hi>Moderation</hi>) his length of days gave him the advantage of <hi>Sole Power,</hi> his Ambition furniſhing <hi>Deſire</hi> and <hi>Art,</hi> to keep out others. This drew upon him the implacable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of a great many, which was yet further augmented by the freſh <hi>Honours,</hi> and <hi>Offices,</hi> that the King was then pleas'd to confer upon him. Time had now wrought a <hi>Revolution,</hi> as in it <hi>ſelf,</hi> ſo in the <hi>Hearts</hi> of the People, who had forgotten the late <hi>Sufferings</hi> of their Fathers, and labour'd under the ſurfeit of a <hi>long Peace</hi>; which having, probably, let in ſome Abuſes, the Commons (to whom the <hi>Preſent</hi> ſeems ever <hi>worſt</hi>) take the Alarm, fall to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the <hi>paſt Ages</hi> they never remembred, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the <hi>Preſent</hi>; though equally ignorant of the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe</hi> of it, and of the <hi>Remedy.</hi> With theſe idle and uſual <hi>Humours,</hi> ſtruck in ſome of the young <hi>Nobility,</hi> that were warm and over weening, though altogether as <hi>unskilful</hi> as the reſt: theſe fall to ſullying the Wiſdom and Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Court-Officers,</hi> by magnifying each caſual miſhap into a Crime, and expoſing every Blemiſh in Government; and then having their Heads fill'd with certain <hi>Ideas</hi> and Phantaſtick <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Commonwealths,</hi> they flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they are able to mold any <hi>State</hi> according to theſe <hi>general Rules,</hi> which in <hi>particular Application</hi> do ſtill appear to be but idle and groſs Abſurdities. Being thus puft up in Opinion of their own worth, they begin to caſt about how to get into <hi>Employment,</hi> a thing they had long deſired<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and now do ſue for; and probable it is that the fartheſt of their <hi>Aim,</hi> as yet, was to be quiet Inſtruments in ſerving

            <p>God, we know, governs the Hearts of <hi>Princes,</hi> and ſends them ſuch <hi>Miniſters,</hi> as the quality of the Subject meriteth: for <hi>Montford</hi> (a <hi>French-man</hi>) became the next Object of the Kings Delight; being a Gentleman of choice <hi>Blood, Education</hi> and <hi>Feature:</hi> And to ſo fond a degree did the heady affection of the <hi>Sovereign</hi> dote upon him, that, in his very Entrance into <hi>Grace,</hi> he made him Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> to the general diſſatisfaction of the <hi>Nobility</hi>; and gave him (to the no leſs offence of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olating the <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>) his Vow'd, Vail'd <hi>Siſter,</hi> to Wife.

            <p>But now, upon this Advantage, the Reines of Rule were poſſeſſ'd by the ambitious <hi>Lords</hi> and entruſted (as <hi>Henry Knighton</hi> ſays) in the hands of the Kings <hi>Half-Brethren, Adam, Guido, Godfrey,</hi> and <hi>William</hi>; the King contenting himſelf (being left to act his own part, as before) with the <hi>Shadow</hi> only, and <hi>Licenſe</hi> of a great <hi>Fortune.</hi> And to ſay the truth, he was ever <hi>Wyer-drawn,</hi> when he was ſo happy as to have about him ſuch worthy Servants as would urge and ſuggeſt things that were for his Honour.

            <p>Now to remedy all theſe Confuſions, and ſupply the Kings neceſſities, a <hi>Parliament</hi> was call'd at laſt; much to

the liking of thoſe Lords, who as little meant to <hi>Relieve</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> as they did to <hi>Heal</hi> the <hi>State</hi>; their End, at that time, being only to lay open, at <hi>Home,</hi> the <hi>Poverty</hi> of their <hi>Maſter</hi>; leſſen his Reputation, <hi>Abroad</hi>; and in thoſe times of <hi>Privilege,</hi> to breath out their <hi>Paſſions</hi> freely. Here they began to twit him with the <hi>Wrong</hi> he had done to the <hi>Publick,</hi> in engroſſing the choyce of the <hi>Chief Juſtice, Chancellour,</hi> and <hi>Treaſurer</hi>; who ought not (they ſaid) to have been Elected, but by the <hi>Common Counſel</hi> of the <hi>Realm</hi>; highly applauding the Reſolution of the Biſhop of <hi>Chiche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> in refuſing to ſurrender the <hi>Great Seal,</hi> but in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> where he receiv'd it. Then they charge him with having conferr'd all the places of <hi>Truſt</hi> and <hi>Profit,</hi> in his diſpoſal, upon <hi>Forreigners</hi>; and leaving his <hi>Engliſh Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> unrewarded; with having ruin'd the <hi>Merchants</hi> Trade by the introducing of <hi>Maletolts,</hi> and impoſing of <hi>Heavy Cuſtoms</hi>; with having violated the <hi>Common Liberty,</hi> by <hi>Non obſtantes</hi> in his <hi>Patents,</hi> thereby to ſecure <hi>Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi> for his private <hi>Favorites</hi>; with having taken the <hi>Bread</hi> out of the Peoples mouths, and forced away their <hi>Horſes</hi> from the very Plow; with ſending his Juſtices into the Country, to oppreſs and fleece the <hi>People,</hi> by <hi>fob'd Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and falſe <hi>Accuſations</hi>; telling him that Sr. <hi>Robert de Purſloe</hi> had extorted great Summs of money from the <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers</hi> of his <hi>Forreſts,</hi> upon pretence of <hi>Encroachments.</hi> So that they were amazed (they ſaid) to hear, that he ſhould now demand <hi>Relief</hi> of them; ſince the <hi>Commonalty</hi> was ſo miſerably pill'd, pol'd, and empoveriſh'd, by the multitude of former <hi>Contributions,</hi> that they were incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of making any ſort of ſupply. And therefore they ſuggeſted to him, that, they being able to prove his need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Expences, ſince the Kingdom began to be oppreſs'd, to have amounted to above eight hundred thouſand pound; it was but fitting that he ſhould call to account, and pluck from his <hi>Favorites</hi>; who had gleaned the <hi>Treaſure</hi> of the

            </p>
            <p>The time being come, and he having ratified afreſh the <hi>Great Charter,</hi> admitted into his <hi>Councel</hi> ſome perſons of the Commons <hi>Election,</hi> and promiſed for the future to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply himſelf for Counſel to <hi>Natives,</hi> not Forreigners; they at length granted him ſuch an <hi>Allowance</hi> as left him at their <hi>Devotion</hi> for a <hi>further Supply.</hi> Thus <hi>Parliaments,</hi> that (<hi>Before</hi>) were ever a Medicine to heal up any <hi>Rupture</hi> in the Princes <hi>Fortunes,</hi> grew (<hi>now</hi>) to be worſe than the <hi>Diſeaſe</hi>; malignant <hi>Humours</hi> being more predominant in them than well-compoſed <hi>Tempers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King having by this, fully diſcovered the <hi>Drift</hi> of his rebellious <hi>Lords</hi>; and finding that they took advantage of his <hi>Neceſſities,</hi> to enſlave him; begins now to act the good <hi>Husband,</hi> cloſeth his hand of <hi>Waſte,</hi> and reſolves (though too late) to bear himſelf upon his own <hi>Legs.</hi> But this Experience is ſtill pernicious to the <hi>Private,</hi> and dangerous to the <hi>Publick Weal</hi> of a <hi>State</hi>; as not being

able to <hi>do,</hi> but by <hi>undoing,</hi> nor to diſcern <hi>Order,</hi> till <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order</hi> ſhews it. And yet ſtill Alas! ſuch was his eaſineſs and flexibility, when he came to be preſt hard by his <hi>French Minions</hi>; that he was not capable of witholding his hand from their inſatiable <hi>Deſires,</hi> and endleſs <hi>ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings:</hi> Inſomuch that it then became a <hi>By-word, Our Inheritance is poſſeſs'd by</hi> Aliens, <hi>and our Houſes by</hi> Strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Dependents upon a King that is exceſſive in <hi>Largeſſes,</hi> become exorbitant in their <hi>Demands</hi>; meaſuring them not by <hi>Reaſon,</hi> but example: <hi>Paſt favours</hi> are never reckon'd upon, nor any Bounty valued but what is purely <hi>Future</hi>; and look how much a Prince diſables himſelf by <hi>Giving,</hi> ſo much the poorer he is of <hi>True Friends</hi>: ſuch <hi>Prodigality,</hi> in a <hi>Sovereign,</hi> ever concluding in the Spoyl and Plunder of his <hi>Subjects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before the King would again ſubmit himſelf to ſo many bold and ſtrict <hi>Inquiries</hi> of his Diſloyal Subjects, as he had endured the laſt <hi>Parliament</hi>; he reſolves to try and undergo all ſhifts, and extremities, that neceſſity and a great mind, could impoſe upon him. Firſt therefore, he expoſes the <hi>Crown-Lands,</hi> then his <hi>Jewels,</hi> to ſale; pawns <hi>Gaſcoyn</hi>; and after <hi>That,</hi> his <hi>Imperial Crown</hi>: And when his <hi>Credit</hi> would ſerve him no longer, (having ſo often fail'd of his word) nor any thing of his <hi>own</hi> left to raiſe mony upon; he then pawns the <hi>Jewels</hi> and <hi>Ornaments</hi> of St. <hi>Edwards Shrine</hi>; and at the long run, (being deſtitute of means to defray the Charge of his <hi>Court</hi>) was forced to break up houſe, and with his Queen and Children to preſs upon the <hi>Charity</hi> of his Subjects for his <hi>Daily Bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus, by <hi>Improvidence,</hi> again reduced himſelf to this low <hi>Ebb</hi>; the Rebellious <hi>Lords</hi> grew more and more intractable, in Confidence that the <hi>Sovereign Power</hi> would,

            <p>The <hi>Perſon</hi> and the <hi>Power</hi> being now both of them in the hands of <hi>Montford</hi> and <hi>Gloceſter</hi>; found no other means of <hi>Security,</hi> or expectation of <hi>Liberty,</hi> than what the emulous <hi>Competition</hi> of <hi>Greatneſs</hi> (which began to break forth between theſe two mighty <hi>Rivals</hi>) gave hope of: For <hi>Leiceſter</hi> deſigning, (by engroſſing from his <hi>Partner</hi> the Perſon of the <hi>King,</hi> and ſecuring to his <hi>Followers</hi> the beſt part of the <hi>Spoil</hi>) to draw more fruit from this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, than, in <hi>Fellowſhip,</hi> it could yield, diſſolv'd the Knot of all their <hi>Amity.</hi> Thus we may obſerve that <hi>equal Authority,</hi> with the <hi>ſame Power,</hi> is ever fatal to all great Actions; for to reduce minds to ſo even a pitch that they ſhould not have ſome ſtrings of <hi>Diſagreement,</hi> is abſolutely impoſſible. <hi>Montford</hi> having thus broken all faith with his <hi>Confederates,</hi> as well as <hi>Duty</hi> to his <hi>Sovereign</hi>; left the Path of <hi>Moderation</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> to approach the King by that of <hi>Haughtineſs</hi> and <hi>Diſtruſt</hi>; plying him with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences that his <hi>Arms</hi> and <hi>Ends</hi> were evermore directed to the good of the <hi>Publick,</hi> and the eaſe of the <hi>People</hi>; that in all <hi>this</hi> he entertain'd no private Paſſion, in oppoſition to the ſenſe of his Allegiance; but was capable of regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating his <hi>Deſires</hi> according to his juſt <hi>Power,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to his Majeſties <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> in caſe he would be rul'd; that is to ſay, (as he explain'd himſelf) command the <hi>Forts</hi> and <hi>Caſtles</hi> of his now <hi>Oppoſite, Gloceſter,</hi> and the reſt, to be deliver'd up into his hands.

            <p>In the next place he appli'd himſelf to the correcting of his own <hi>natural Infirmities:</hi> Wiſely judging, that though the Princes <hi>Manners</hi> are only a <hi>mute Law,</hi> yet have they more of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Vigour</hi> in them, than thoſe of <hi>Letters.</hi> So that though he might now and then touch upon the skirts of <hi>Vice,</hi> yet was he ever after cautious of entering the <hi>Circle.</hi> And whereas the Crimes and Enormities of the great Men of his <hi>Court</hi> were, at this this time, become ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagantly numerous, that they were drawn into <hi>Example</hi> and <hi>Imitation:</hi> He purg'd <hi>this</hi> likewiſe with ſingular ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>actitude of <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Severity</hi>; knowing full well
