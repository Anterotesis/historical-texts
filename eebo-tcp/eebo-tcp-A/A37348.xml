         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And we do not meet together under a colour, or pretence of tender Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to plot, and contrive Inſurrections againſt the King, but meet together in the Power and Spirit of the Lord, without any ſuch pretence, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allity to Worſhip and Glorifie God in our Bodies, Souls, and Spirits, which are his; and for ſo doing it hath coſt many of our Friends and Brethren their lives, by impriſonment, exile, and otherwiſe; neither dare we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the aſſemblings of our ſelves together, as the manner of ſome was, &amp;c. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>r meetings have been peaceable all along on our account, though rude People have come, and railed againſt us, and abuſed us. And our Principle is, and ever was againſt ſuch practices as Sedition, or contriving Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, but it leads us to the peaceable Truth, and to ſeek the peace of all men, and to Chriſt Jeſus who is the Way to God, who is the Authour of Peace: And ſo we are by Chriſt Jeſus taught to deny all Sedition, Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, and Inſurrection, and he doth teach us to deny all ſuch things, who was before all ſuch things, and ſeditious Sects were, and will be when they are all gone, for he is the ſame to day, yeſterday and for ever.</p>
            <p>And if any ſhould pretend tenderneſs of Conſcience, and Religious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, and under that colour intend a quite contrary thing, as to contrive Inſurrections, &amp;c. this is groſs hypocriſie and diſſimulation, which our Souls ever did, and do abhor, and deny; and ſuch are unlawful Meetings: And were not the Magiſtrates, as Mayors, Juſtices, and other Officers, &amp;c. enjoyned by their Oathes before, to look after the preſervation of the peace, againſt all ſuch ſeditious Meetings, as much as this Act doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire?</p>
            <p>And if any Magiſtrate ſhould take hold upon any that are innocent of theſe Actions mentioned in the Title and Preamble of the Act, Then, whether or no (the innocent Perſon being defamed, beſides his ſuffering, and ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his good) the Lord will not take notice to defend the Innocent, and judge for ſuch things.</p>
            <p>Now if four beſides the Family may meet that are ſeditious ſpirits, may not many ſuch little Meetings do more hurt then if there were two or three hundred together? for then they may ſpeak out their minds to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, which they could not before hundreds of mixt People. Now if <hi>Caeſar</hi> muſt have his Due, muſt we not meet together to give God his due.</p>
            <p>And if ſuch an Act ſhould have been made by the <hi>Jews</hi> in the dayes of Chriſt, would it not have taken hold of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles? for had not he twelve with him, and ſeventy, and ſometimes hundreds, and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands: And was there not many Sects amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet all profeſt God? And are there not ſeveral Sects in <hi>Turkey?</hi> do not <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> keep their Meetings on ſeveral dayes diſtinct? And in the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Country, are there not ſeveral Religions? And in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the low Countries, and in many parts of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and other parts of the World are there not ſeveral Religions? and yet they have their peaceable liberty. And did not God let <hi>Adam</hi> have liberty in the Earth? and <hi>Abraham</hi> let <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> have liberty of the Wilderneſs? So why ſhould not they have liber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> that be Innocent, to wait upon, and worſhip God, who are clear from Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and contriving Inſurrection under pretence of tender Conſciences, for any pretence whatſoever? concerning which we that are called <hi>Quakers</hi> can ſay in the Preſence of God, we are free and clear from, and teſtifie to all men, though we have been ſo accuſed, and have been tryed by impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to death, and baniſhment, and ſpoyling of Goods, yet were alwayes innocent, and ſo we are the ſame to this day, who do excerciſe a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience towards God, and towards all men.</p>
            <p>And are any to be credibly informed againſt or ſuppreſt, but ſuch as are known to be ſeditious, and are of that Spirit, that under a pretence of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conſcience plot and contrive Inſurrections? If ſo, Then whether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and peaceable People, that meet really to worſhip God in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and in the Peaceable Truth (which all plotting is out of) theſe are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned according to the title and reaſon of this Act.</p>
            <p>And whether the Liturgy doth not allow of People to meet together, to worſhip God in Spirit and Truth, without limitation of Time, Place or Number? For ought not men at all times, and in all places to perform their bounden duty to God, and to pray to him, and to give thanks for his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, which they daily receive? And doth not the Lord ſay, <hi>In every place Offerings ſhall be offered to my Name, Mal.</hi> 1. And doth not the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>I will that men pray every where, lifting up holy Hands without wrath and doubting.</hi> And doth not the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>As every man hath received the Gift, even ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the ſame one to another, at good Stewards of the manifold Graces of God, Pet.</hi> 4 10. And did not Chriſt to incourage his little Flock, ſay, <hi>Whereſoever two or three are gathered together in my Name, I am in the midſt of them:</hi> Not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them to that number, and no more, as you may ſee how Chriſtianity after ſpread, as the Epiſtles to the Churches declare. So this is not to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them that be peaceable in Chriſt Jeſus, from meeting either in a Barn, Houſe, Field, Back-ſide, or any other place; for they met thouſands with him in the Wilderneſs. And doth not the Prophet ſay, <hi>The holy One muſt not be limitted?</hi> And doth not the Liturgy allow of the ſame Worſhip, and Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings as the holy Scriptures allow of?</p>
