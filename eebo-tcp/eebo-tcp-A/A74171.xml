            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE SUCCEEDING PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <p>THE holy Ark of the Church and State having been ſo long and ſo highly toſſed under divers tempeſtuous ſtorms, threatning a Shipwrack; the inſolent Mariners found out a ſtrange Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to preſerve the almoſt foundred Ship, by throwing the Pilot over board, that they themſelves might ſit at Stern; which they have manag'd ſo ill, that the Ship had been long ſince ſunk under their baſe and unskilful Conduct, had not that Celeſtial Pilot by a ſtrong hand moſt miraculouſly protected her from the moſt dangerous Rocks and Sands, by whoſe wiſe and powerfull ſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage (a Calm being made) I hope ſhe will ſuddenly Anchor in the Old and ſafe Haven. The late deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Pilots, the new State-mongers (the better to contrive their curſed Deſigns, and ſecure their guilty actions from a future juſt account, and keep their ill-gotten Eſtates by the deluge of Church and Crown) have ſacrificed two of the moſt honorable Eſtates of Parliament to the fury of their horried Avarice and Ambition, and by the aſſiſtance of their Maſters the Jeſuites, under the ſpecious titles of Godlineſſe, Liberty, and common Safety, have ſo far made themſelves Saints, as wholly to inherit the Land; which to effect, they have ſacrilegiouſly prophan'd whatſoever is ſacred, and barberouſly murthered the King, and baniſhed his Royal Relations, pulled down the Reverend Fathers of the Church, killed the Perſons, and poſſeſſed themſelves of the Eſtates of the moſt eminent men for Religion and Loyalty; and in a word, have almoſt quite deſtroyed our truly reformed Church, and heretofore flouriſhing Nation; ſo that there is no means left us (under God) to ſettle the Church and State, but a full and free Parliament, compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the three Eſtates of the Kingdom, each complying with other in a handſom correſpondence, and regular ſubordination; the Houſe of Commons being commiſſioned <hi>ad inquirendum,</hi> the Lords <hi>ad deliberandum,</hi> and the King <hi>ad determinandum de negotiis Regni:</hi> the ſeveral Acts of Parliament being ſo many happy Reſults and Products of their mutual Counſels, which receive their firſt conception, and imperfect delineation of parts from the contrivance and deliberation of the two Houſes, and afrerward Life, Liberty, and perfection, from the Kings moſt excellent Majeſty in the Signature of his Royal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and Approbation. This moſt admired frame of Government (the Glory of our own, and the Envy of forreign Nations) in which the ſeveral particular Intereſts of the Kingdom are ſo handſomly involv'd in that publick concern of Parliamentary Government, which ſpeaketh a high ſatisfaction to all degrees of Perſons, who have their Affairs tranſacted by their own Delegates, both in the preſentment and redreſſe of their Grievances, and the conſtitution of wholſom Laws for the ſecurity of their lives and Fortunes, to which they have reaſon moſt readily to ſubmit in all due obedience, ſeeing they are enacted by their own Repreſentatives in Parliament: which that it may be rightly elected, I make bold to preſent the Honorable City and Kingdom with theſe Qualifications.
<list>
                  <item>1. That no Perſon be Elected a Member of the ſucceeding Parliament that is an Enemy to Kingly Government.</item>
                  <item>2. That none of the Sectaries may be Elected, who are generally acted with Factious Jeſuitical Principles inconſiſtent with the Ancient Eſtabliſhed Government.</item>
                  <item>3. That no Purchaſer of Kings or Church, or commonly called Delinquents Lands; or any Perſon that hath an Office in the Exciſe, Cuſtom, or the like, be Elected, they being intereſſed Perſons, and obliged to maintain a Commonwealth, in oppoſition to the King and Houſe of Lords: <hi>two eſtates of Parliament according to its former legal Conſtitutions.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Now I have diſcharged my conſcience to God and Man, in ſpeaking my humble Deſires of a free and full Parliament, as the great concern to build up the ruined Church, and repair the breaches of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed State, according to the Ancient known fundamental Laws, to the Glory of God, and the happineſs of the Nation.</p>
