            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>MADAM,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT was a very merciful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which brought your <hi>Honour</hi> to your dear Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers aſſiſtance, in her dying ſickneſs; by which, as you had the pleaſure of recreating her Spirit with your preſence, and of giving an high Demonſtration of your Piety to her, in her low and weak ſtate of body (a vertue of great price with God, and remarkably rewarded by him, even in this life)
<pb facs="tcp:97741:3"/>
So alſo the happineſs of being an eye witneſs to her Chriſtian De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, in her ſharpeſt Pains and Agonies; how her Faith and Patience triumphed over them all; which, no doubt, did much ſweeten the ſorrow, that her outward di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, inflicted upon your tender Heart. And, indeed, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſo holy a Life, ſhould have ſo Happy an end. <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright; for the end of that man is Peace.</hi> This Pretious Saint had made her Bed, before ſhe was to lye down on it. Long had ſhe been gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Spices (Graces I mean) for her dying Neſt; in the ſweet Odours of which, ſhe at laſt ſo Holily, and Peaceably, breathed
<pb facs="tcp:97741:3"/>
forth her Gracious Soul, into the Arms of her beloved Saviour. And, now <hi>Madam,</hi> ſeeing God hath determined your Will, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring his, it will highly become your <hi>Honour</hi> to bear her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe,<note place="margin">Non Maeremus quòd talem ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus, ſed gratias agimus, quòd ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buimus, imò ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemus Deo enim vivunt omnia, &amp; quicquid reverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ad Dominum, in familiae nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro computatur. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 27. <hi>Epitaph Paulae Matris.</hi>
               </note> as Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> did the death of the <hi>Noble Paula,</hi> whom he ſo much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured for her Piety. Not by Mourning you have loſt, but by Praiſing God you had ſo Pretious a Saint to be your Mother; and that you had her ſo long, even to live to ſee, and give her Bleſſing to your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Children, before her depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yea, that you have her ſtill. Is there no way to have our Friends, unleſs we have them in our ſight? She is not loſt, that ſtill
<pb facs="tcp:97741:4"/>
lives. Her death was the end of her Mortality, but there is no end of her Life. <hi>In her Spirit,</hi> ſhe lives in Heaven with God, to whom ſhe lived on Earth. <hi>In her good Name,</hi> ſhe lives with all that knew her, or heard of her admirable Piety. This like an after beam of the Sun-ſett, followed her, to her bed of the Grave, and ſtill ſhines to her Honour. The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the juſt is bleſſed, though the name of the wicked rots, even while it is remembred; as the name of <hi>Pilate</hi> doth in the <hi>Creed,</hi> to his reproach and curſe. <hi>And as to her Vertues,</hi> ſhe lives in your ſelf, and in as many other of her Noble Deſcendants, as imitate her Piety. It joyed this Bleſſed Saint while alive, that ſhe ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:97741:4"/>
leave her ſurviving Children, and ſo many of her Grand-Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, walking in the Truth. And if an <hi>Heathen</hi> took ſuch high content, that the Honour which he arrived to, befel him, while his Parents were yet living; whereby they had a pleaſure in ſeeing his happineſs; How much more may it comfort the Pious Relations of this Saint, that this their Pretious Parent, had the joy of ſeeing them ennobled with Divine Grace, and ſo in their way to Heaven, before her ſelf went thither. I am ſure, it hath been an Heart-breaking-ſorrow to ſome Children, that they converted not to God, before their Godly Parents bodies, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into Duſt; and thereby cauſe them to go ſighing with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb facs="tcp:97741:5"/>
to their Graves; who, might they but firſt have ſeen them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, would have gone down to them ſinging for joy. It is a bleſsed ſight, to behold Children, eſpecially of Noble Perſons, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating their Godly Parents Graces. <hi>God is no reſpecter of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi>

This Conſideration made me more readily obey your <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi> commands, in publiſhing theſe mean Papers; hoping that this great Example of Piety, in ſo <hi>Noble a Lady,</hi> together, with
<pb facs="tcp:97741:5"/>
the Honour that attended her to the Grave for it, may cauſe ſome of high Birth, a little more, to conſider their great miſtake, in thinking to overtake Honour in the dirty paths of Prophaneneſs and Irreligion; and ſo be moved, at laſt, to change their way, and turn into this clean road of Piety; wherein this good <hi>Lady</hi> walking, lived with ſo much eſteem, and dyed ſo wonderfully lamented. The character, that I have here given of her, is True, but not full; nay, far ſhort of her worth. Her Graces were of ſo high a ſtrain, that I may truly ſay,<note place="margin">Quid in illâ virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, quid ingenii, quid ſanctitatis, quid puritatis invenerim; vereor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, ne fidem credulitatis excedam. <hi>Hieron.

<pb facs="tcp:97741:6"/>
commending <hi>Marcella,</hi> a Noble <hi>Roman Lady.</hi> I was afraid to ſpeak all I knew of her Wiſdom, Sanctity, Charity, and other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, leſt I ſhould ſeem to exceed the belief of ſome; thoſe, I mean, who knew her not; for as any were more, and longer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with her, ſo their eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of her advanced higher. And muſt not that Piece be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably well drawn, which is moſt commended by thoſe (if able to judge) that ſtand neareſt, and look longeſt on it? And none, I think, will deny, that famous light of his Age, <hi>Biſhop Uſher,</hi> to have been as able to judge in this caſe, as any other; and what an high eſteem he had of this <hi>Lady,</hi> and her <hi>Noble Lord</hi> and <hi>Husband</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:97741:6"/>

               <hi>The thing that I have moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired in your Noble Lord, is, that ſuch lowlineſs of mind, and ſuch an high pitch of a brave Spirit, ſhould be yoaked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and lodged in one Breaſt. And on the other ſide, when I reflect upon you; methinks, I underſtand that ſaying of the Apoſtle better, than I did. That as the man is the Image and Glory of God, ſo the woman is the Glory of the Man. And to your comfort, let me add this, That if I have any inſight in things of this Nature, or have any judgment to diſcern of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; I have clearly beheld en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven
<pb facs="tcp:97741:7"/>
in your Soul, the Image and Superſcription of my God.</hi> Thus wrote this <hi>Excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> whoſe admirable judgment, may keep any ſober Perſon from thinking him in this high cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, guilty of raſhneſs and light credulity; and his known integrity is enough to free him from all ſuſpicion of abuſing his Pen to any ſervile flattery. And they, who knew the lowly Spirit of this <hi>good Lady,</hi> and how ready ſhe was to be dejected from an over deep ſence of her unworthineſs, will find reaſon to believe, that this <hi>Man of God,</hi> gave this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of her, to her, as a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial to revive her Humble Spirit; and therefore brings it in with, <hi>And this to your comfort I add.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:97741:7"/>
But I am too troubleſom, I fear, to your <hi>Honour;</hi> my hearty Prayers are, that as you have begun, ſo you may go on in living your <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> Holy Life; and that then yon may, in a good Old Age, dye her happy death, with much Peace and Honour. And that ſo long, as you ſhall have a Poſterity live on Earth, your good <hi>Mother</hi> may never be Dead; but may from Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, to Generation, have thoſe deſcending from her, that will keep her Name, and Pretious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample alive, by a due Veneration of the one, and Pious imitation of the other.</p>

            <p>WHAT <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Faith, that may we concerning the Reſurrection of the dead, <hi>Articulus eſt Eccleſiae ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, aut cadentis</hi>; it is an Article with which the <hi>Church</hi> ſtandeth or falleth; Yet ſo foul an errour had taken the head of ſome Members in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> as to deny this grand Truth, which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> calls in another place,<note place="margin">Heb. <hi>6.2.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>one of the principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt: how ſay ſome among you, there is no Reſurrection of the dead? v.</hi> 12.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97741:9"/>
And, is it not ſtrange, that ſuch who profeſſed to believe the Reſurrection of Chriſt ſhould deny their own! but much more, that any in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> (eſpecially in thoſe early days) ſhould have ſuch a darkneſs found up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their minds, who ſtood ſo near the riſing Sun? and that while S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf was yet alive, who had planted this Church; by this we ſee, though Truth is errours elder, yet errour is not much Truths younger. Though the Goſpel-Church was pureſt in the Primitive times, yet it ſoon began to corrupt in its Members. Not unapt therefore was his ſaying, who compared (in this reſpect) the gathering of Churches to the gathering of Apples, which when firſt gathered, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear all fair and ſound, but then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a while, ſome amongſt them begin to ſpeak, and others to diſcover their rottinneſs. No doubt this Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and ſo others gathered by the reſt of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> appeared in their Members very ſound in the faith, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97741:9"/>
fair in their lives at their firſt embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel; yet ſome we ſee did thus ſoon diſcover corruption in both. Now to recover the tainted, and eſpecially to preſerve the ſound from this dangerous infection, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſets himſelf to defend this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of our Faith, well knowing, that this was a blow made at the root of Chriſtianity; which muſt needs fall to the ground, if this cannot be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and he doth it with ſuch invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble arguments, that if any Heretick ſhall now deny it, the reaſon cannot be deficiency in the proof here given, but rather a criminous conſcience in himſelf, which makes him on his own defence, deny <hi>a Reſurrection,</hi> for fear of the <hi>Judgment</hi> which attends it.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> having done this, and withal ſhewn the glorious array, in which the <hi>Saints</hi> ſhall ariſe out of their beds of duſt: he then <hi>v.</hi> 55. ſings his <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or triumphant ſong over Death, and out-braves this King of Terrours to his face, that is wont to keep the hearts
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97741:10"/>
of poor Mortals in the miſerable bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of a ſlaviſh fear. <hi>O Death where is thy ſting? O Grave, where is thy vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory?</hi> As if he had ſaid, Death do now thy worſt, we fear thee not: thou mayeſt indeed get us into thy hands, but thou canſt not long keep us in thy power, fall we ſhall into the Grave, but we fall to riſe again, and when we ariſe out of our Graves, then ſhalt thou Death fall into thy Grave, never to ariſe again. Then <hi>v.</hi> 57. he ſings with an holy raviſhment of joy the praiſes of God, and Chriſt our Redeemer, by whoſe atchievement this glorious victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over death is won: <hi>The ſting of Death is Sin, and the ſtrength of Sin is the Law; but thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This indeed is our <hi>David,</hi> who cut off the head of this <hi>Goliah</hi> with his own ſword, killed Death by falling dead upon it; he unſtung this Serpent by receiving its ſting into his own bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed body. He overcame this great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, by ſubmitting himſelf for a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97741:10"/>
time to be conquered by it; when Chriſt loſt his life, then his whole Army of Saints won the day. Death now to them is no death, that which was their puniſhment as Sinners, is now their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge as Saints. That which ſtood amongſt the threatnings of the <hi>Law,</hi> and was the moſt formidable of them all, hath now changed its place, and is got amongſt the promiſes of the <hi>Goſpel. All things are yours, or Life or Death.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21. So pretious an oyl doth our Apoſtle extract from this ſlain Scorpion; ſo ſweet an honey comb doth he find in this dead Lyons breaſt, and gives it into the hand of the Saints, to go eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, to their unſpeakable joy and comfort: but, is this victory over Death only matter of joy and comfort unto Believers? Oh no; <hi>Bleſſed art thou O Land, when thy Princes eat for ſtrength, and not for drunkenneſs;</hi> and, bleſſed art thou O <hi>Emanuels</hi> Land, when thy Saints feed on the priviledges and promiſes of the Goſpel, not to make them drunk with Pride, nor to lay them aſleepin Sloth;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97741:11"/>
but to rèfreſh them to run the Race ſet before them, and the Joy of the Lord becomes their ſtrength; the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> therefore goes on to improve and cloſe up his diſcourſe on this ſubject with an Exhortation to Duty; <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, my beloved brethren, be ye ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, always abounding in the work of the Lord,</hi> that is, be ſtedfaſt in the faith of the Goſpel, and eſpecially in the belief of this particular Article of our Chriſtian faith, the Reſurrection of the dead, and then live up unto this belief; walk and work as for God while you live, as believing you ſhall, when dead, riſe again. Now my Text hath the nature of a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Argument to inforce this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation upon them, <hi>for as much as ye know, that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which words theſe two things are obſervable. <hi>Firſt,</hi> the Nature and Quality of the ſervice or work of God, it is a <hi>Labour</hi>; the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> changeth the the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>i. e. Work,</hi> which he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97741:11"/>
had uſed in the Exhortation immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately preceding into this of Labour, and that not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſignifies any ordinary labour but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the hardeſt of labour; <hi>Negotium, quod nos caedit &amp; quaſi vires frangit,</hi> ſaith an <hi>Etymoligiſt,</hi> and this we may conceive to pre-occupate an Objection of ſuch that could be willing to do ſome work, but afraid of meeting with too much labour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Here is the reward that ſweetens this labour, and may make the Chriſtian more eaſily ſubmit unto it. <hi>For as much as ye know your labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord.</hi> In which, <hi>firſt,</hi> here is the certainty of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>knowing, or ye know, your labour is not in vain.</hi> It is not an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain ſurmiſe, taken up by a ſelf-flattering hope from ſome eaſie ground of a weak <hi>fortaſſis,</hi> or may be; but ye know it upon infallible grounds; ye doubt no more of the being of another World, where God will reward his faithful labourers, then ye do of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97741:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
being of this which you ſee with your bodily eyes, and live at preſent in. Here you know it, though here you do not receive it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendency of this reward, 'tis a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as well as ſure. For there is a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in this Phraſe, an elegant figure in <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> wherein more is meant than is ſpoken: the words ſound low, but the ſenſe is high. You ſhall not loſe your labour, that is, you ſhall be infinite gainers by it, you ſhall receive a reward greater than now you can con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceive. Thus in our own Language we are wont to ſpeak, when we would make one willing to do a work we ſet them about, we'll ſay to him, you ſhall not repent doing of it, you ſhall not be a loſer, or work for nothing; in which we intend more than we expreſs, that it ſhall redound to his great advantage. Thus here under this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>your labour is not in vain,</hi> is intended no leſs than Heaven, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great and eternal weight of glory, which no tongue of men or
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97741:12"/>
Angels can expreſs how great it is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> of the <hi>firſt,</hi> the nature or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Chriſtians work; his work is a labour, and ſo will every one find it, that means to be faithful in doing of it. Man is born to labour, and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is not born again to be idle; God ſends not his ſervants into the World as a Play-houſe, but Work-houſe; and ſuch a work it is which he appoints them, as is not an idle mans buſineſs, that may be done ſitting at his eaſe on the chair of ſloth, but requires his greateſt pains and diligence; therefore Chriſtianity is in Scripture compared to the moſt toylſom imployments: is it a labour to run a race, which ſtrains all parts of a mans body; what is it then to run this ſpiritual race, which is every ſtep of the way up-hill, and ſtraineth not legs and lungs as the other doth, but faith and patience which is a harder exerciſe? Is the Husbandmans work laborious to plow up his ſtiff ground, and with many a weary ſtep to go ſowing his heavy land, eſpecially
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97741:13"/>
in a wet ſeaſon? what then is the Chriſtians labour, who is to plow on the Rock, to break up an heart by nature, harder than ſtone, and whoſe whole life is a wet ſeed-time, he living in a Valley of tears. Is the Souldiers work laborious and hazardous, who muſt be content to lye hard, and fair hard, and which is more, prepare for hard blows, and knocks, yea wounds, and death it ſelf? then the Chriſtians cannot be eaſie, who muſt deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and take up his Croſs and follow Chriſt, and that cheerfully, amidſt all his loſſes and croſſes. For this Captain <hi>non amat gementem Militem</hi>? loves not a Souldier that followeth him groaning and grumbling. But for the further clearing and amplifying this point, it will not be amiſs to deſcend to ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, to diſcover what it is that makes the Chriſtians work ſo laborious and difficult; and in the next place, why God hath charged Religion with ſo much labour, and ſo many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:97741:13"/>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> of the <hi>firſt,</hi> The vaſt circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of his duty; the more ſtrings an Inſtrument hath, the more art is required to handle it well; the larger the Field is, the more labour it will coſt him that is to Till it; in a word, the greater the Servants charge is, and the more buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which lies upon his hánds, the more care is needful to tend it; and where the care muſt be great, the labour can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be little, becauſe care is it ſelf one of the greateſt labours: O how great then is the Chriſtians labour? whoſe care and duty has no leſs compaſs than the commandment of <hi>God,</hi> which is of ſuch vaſt comprehenſion, that the <hi>Pſalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt,</hi> who ſaw an end of all perfections, could ſee no end of it. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.96. <hi>I have ſeen an end of all perfections, but thy commandment is exceeding broad.</hi> The Commandment here includes both <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and the Chriſtians du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty extends to, yea, diffuſeth it ſelf over both. <hi>Firſt,</hi> the Law Moral, this is bound upon the Chriſtian in point of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to make it his rule, as ſtrictly as it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97741:14"/>
was upon innocent <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf, though not upon ſuch ſtrait conditions, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal conſequences. The Chriſtian is bound to it upon peril of contracting ſin, though not of incurring death and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; the Chriſtian hath no more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to tranſgreſs the Law than <hi>Adam</hi> had, though he hath a promiſe of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don upon repentance, when he hath ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which <hi>Adam</hi> had not; how indeed can we imagine that Chriſt, who was made a curſe for ſin, would come to be a cloak to ſin? now is it an eaſie work, for the Chriſtian to keep his heart in a ſincere compliance with, and reſpect to, this Law in his daily walking? a Law which is ſo large, as reacheth from Heaven to Earth, commanding us to keep a conſcience void of offence to God and Man; a Law ſo pure and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, that forbids all ſin, omiſſions of good, as well as commiſſions of evil; that indites him for a Murderer that doth not feed his Brother (yea his Enemy) as well as he that ſtabs him to the heart; him that doth not pray to God,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97741:14"/>
as well as him that doth curſe him; the barren Heath without good fruit, as well as the Dunghil-life of the profane ſinner filled with the ſtinking weeds of groſs crimes, that condemneth ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den paſſions, as well as deliberate ſins; that bindeth the ſoul to its good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, as well as the hands. Is it an eaſie thing to hate every falſe way? to be ready to every good work? to have reſpect to every Command, which yet he muſt have that will not be put to ſhame, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. <hi>willing in all things to live honeſtly.</hi> Yet this he muſt do, that will keep a good conſcience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.18. is not here enough to fill the Chriſtians head with care, and his heart continually with an holy fear and trembling? But this is not all his work; for <hi>ſecondly,</hi> the Evangelical Law is alſo bound upon the Chriſtian; the ſum of which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> gives us in theſe two comprehenſive duties,<note place="margin">Acts.</note> 
               <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; and are theſe to be got, or exerciſed when got, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97741:15"/>
labour? When the poor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian hath done his utmoſt to keep the Law, how far ſhort doth he fall of that exact Rule? Now theſe deficiencies and obliquities call for repentance, and is it eaſie for him to comply with this duty? is it eaſie to rifle his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſearch his own heart, ſo impartially, as if he forgot it was his own houſe he was ſearching, and his own ſhame he was to diſcover; yet this is a neceſſary antecedent to the act of repentance: how can he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the <hi>Errata's</hi> or faults of a book, that never read nor examined it? and to do it ſurely will coſt ſome pains. I confeſs this review the Chriſtian is to make, is more eaſily done, when he doth it daily, and examines his life (if I may ſo ſay) ſheet by ſheet, as it is printed off in every particular days converſation: but even this is a labour too heavy for a ſlothful heart to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, is it eaſie when the poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath found out his many ſins and failings, upon this review, to get his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97741:15"/>
heart into a melting frame and ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſenſe of his ingratitude and diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity to God in them, ſo as to throw up thoſe ſweet morſels with more bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of ſpirit, than they were ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed down with pleaſure. In a word, Is it eaſie for the poor Chriſtian to get theſe Inmates out of doors, which he hath ſo unadviſedly let in, to clear his affections of that poyſon, with which theſe his ſins have infected them? Is it eaſie to recover the ſtrength of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, which his ſins muſt needs have much looſned and weakned? The ſecond great duty of the Goſpel is Faith, and this is as hard as the other; for indeed the difficulty of believing makes that of repenting ſo hard. Is it eaſie to aſſent to the truth of theſe Myſteries of the Goſpel, which are contrary to the apprehenſions of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt reaſon, and beyond the compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the Chriſtians moſt elevated underſtanding? Is it eaſie for one of a wounded ſpirit, ſunk and dejected as low as Hell, under the heavy ſenſe of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97741:16"/>
his guilt, to lift up an eye of faith to the promiſe, and to conceive a hope, that ſuch a Wretch as he hath been, may ever find grace and favour in the eyes of a juſt and holy God? Verily, it is a wonder little leſs, than that of the Prophets, in making Iron to ſwim; it is eaſie for a ſtupid ſinner (indeed) to dream of a pardon, while Conſcience is aſleep; but when this is once throughly awake, only he that can ſtill the waves and winds in a ſtorm at Sea, can pacifie this, can give either power to believe, or peace in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. Is it eaſie to repent, and bring forth the meet fruits of it, good works, and not to make them the Idol of our truſt? not to relye on the firſt to procure our pardon here, nor on the other to purchaſe our reward hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; but to rejoyce only in Chriſt Jeſus, as the ſole entire object of our truſt for both.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The curious Sculpture with which every Duty in Religion muſt be engraved, to render it accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97741:16"/>
to God, a miſcarriage in any of which is (like an hair on the writers pen) enough to mar and blot his fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt copy, for <hi>bonum ex integris. First,</hi> every duty in Religion, to render it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God muſt ſpring from a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural principle. It is not labour in the Lord, except the labourer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be in the Lord. <hi>Actio ſequitur vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam,</hi> a carnal man can do no other than a carnal action, though the matter of it be ſpiritual. A dead ſtate can have no other but dead works, <hi>a corrupt Tree cannot bring forth good fruit. Mat.</hi> 7.12. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Chriſtians work muſt be performed with an holy fervor, <hi>Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently. Pſalm.</hi> 119.4. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>valde, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hementer.</hi> The word is emphatical, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting an exerting the utmoſt force of our Souls. Zeal is the religious part of our affections, the firſt-born and ſtrength of a mans ſpirit, and therefore God ſets it apart for himſelf, as his peculiar por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>fervent in ſpirit ſerving the Lord</hi>; without this, he accounts himſelf ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97741:17"/>
not ſerved, and accordingly deals with ſuch cold ſervitours, giving them as cold welcom as they do him ſervice; <hi>curſed is he that doth the work of the Lord negligently</hi>; If we would repent, we muſt be <hi>zealous and repent, Rev.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 2. if hear the word, we muſt be <hi>ſwift to hear</hi>; if pray, it muſt be <hi>an effectual fervent prayer,</hi> or elſe it is but <hi>thuribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum ſine prunis,</hi> a cenſure without fire. If we would give an alms, we muſt <hi>draw out our ſoul,</hi> as well as our purſe to the hungry. Now thoſe imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are counted moſt laborious, to which moſt ſtrength and force muſt be put, and thoſe which intend the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the ſoul, more than ſuch as ſtrain the limbs of the body; the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars labour in his ſtudy, is more ſpending, than the Plow-mans in the field. What then is the Chriſtians la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, which exerts the zeal and heat of his ſpirit? O how hard is it to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, or kindled, to keep this heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fire alive, on a hearth ſo damp and cold as our heart is? <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97741:17"/>
work muſt be done from a right motive to a right end; <hi>Firſt,</hi> a right motive from obedience to the will of God, and that ſuch as ſprings from the love of God; he doth not Gods work that doth not obey him, and he doth not obey him, that doth not love him, that only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true obedience, which is hearty obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. <hi>Ye have obeyed him from the heart</hi>;<note place="margin">Rom. 6.8.</note> and that only hearty obedience, which is loving; for love hath the regency of the heart, and it goes only whither love car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth it. O how hard is this, where there is ſo much of the ſlave, even in thoſe that are children? where <hi>Hagar</hi> ſo oft over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tops <hi>Sarah's</hi> ſervile fear, our filial affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; <hi>Secondly,</hi> it muſt be to a right end; it is in vain to wind up the watch, if it be not ſet to the right figure, or to draw the Arrow (though to the head) if the Archers eye direct it not to the right mark; Zeal winds up and draws forth the powers of the ſoul, it makes the Chriſtian act vigorouſly, and forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: but if ſincerity (which is the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleneſs of the ſouls eye) be not preſent
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97741:18"/>
to direct it ultimately to the glory of God, the labour is in vain; the faſter a man goes, (when out of his way) the worſe; for the faſter he goes, the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath to come back: he that is ſlothful in the Lords work doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe him, but he that makes a great buſtle in Religion, and by this his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity calls others eyes to behold his zeal, yet ſecretly intends his own, not Gods praiſe, provokes him more, becauſe more hypocritical in what he doth: hypocriſie being to ſin, what putrifacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to diſeaſes; the more of this in a diſeaſe, the more dangerous it makes it; the more of that in a ſin, the more abominable it makes it: nay further, though the aim be not falſe, yet if that which God allows to be our infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour end, be made our ultimate, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praves the action; if I aim at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and relief of a poor mans neceſſity in my alms (which I may and ought) yet if this be the higheſt I look, and my eye paſſeth not through this, to the glorifying of God, it becomes unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97741:18"/>
a man may loſe the prize by ſhooting ſhort, as well as wide of the mark; now how hard to keep our eye fixed on this ultimate end? truly even as hard as to keep our eye fixt on a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle object, through an Optick Glaſs, held by a trembling hand. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Every Duty muſt be timed aright; the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians life is full of duties, and thoſe very various; now he is called to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe himſelf in one, then in another; now to pray, anon to meditate; now to be in his Cloſet, then to be in his Shop about his worldly calling; now to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, then to publick; now to reprove, then to encourage or comfort his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. As one that hath a Shop full of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Tools, all neceſſary for his Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but this for that purpoſe, and that for this in it; now if he ſhould cut with his Axe, when he ſhould ſmooth with his Plain, he would ſoon ſpoil his work; that which is at one time a Duty, would, if done, at another be a Sin. Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in our worldly Calling on the week day is the work of the Lord;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97741:19"/>
but the ſame on the Lords day would be Satans; no doubt as many a fair Child hath been loſt by an untimely Birth, ſo many a good Work ſpoiled by an unſeaſonable performance; and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern time and judgment for our actions, requireth both wiſdom and care, and theſe labour and pains.</p>

               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The difficulty the Chriſtian finds to order his Converſation, ſo that his care for one part of his work may not hinder him in another. Now the reaſon of this difficulty, is the ſeeming contrariety of ſome duties to others: Seeming, I ſay, not real, indeed it is in Satans ſervice only (not in Gods) that there is a real contrariety of work: Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors have their oppoſites; he that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains one, cannot, if he underſtands himſelf, hold ſome others; ſo in Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Luſts, ſome are at ſuch a feud, that when one is in the Throne, the other is kept under, but all Truths agree lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly together, being all but one Faith; and ſo do the Graces of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, being all the effect of one and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97741:19"/>
the ſame Holy Spirit; they do no more hinder one another in acting, than the ſeveral wheels in a well made Clock do one anothers motions; or the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous members of the body, one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Operations and Functions; yet, I ſay, there is a ſeeming contrariety. And as it requires Art and care to touch the ſeveral ſtrings of an Inſtrument, that have different Sounds, ſo as from all may reſult one harmonious ſound, ſo much more holy skill and care in a Chriſtian to exerciſe theſe many vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Graces, and perform ſo many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Duties, in ſuch a ſweet concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and fellowſhip, that from all, there may reſult an uniform Holineſs in the courſe of his life. The Chriſtian muſt be Zealous, but leave room for Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or elſe like a Ship that hath all Sail and no Ballaſt, he'll grow top heavy; he muſt fear to ſin, and yet hope in the Mercy of God, when he hath ſinned and repents of it; 'tis his duty to draw near to the Throne of Grace with an Holy boldneſs; but it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97741:20"/>
is his duty even then to preſerve an Holy awe and reverence; he muſt be ſenſible of the hand of God when afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or elſe he is not a Man; but then he muſt bear it patiently, or elſe he is not a Chriſtian; he muſt be meek and lowly in his carriage to all, even the meaneſt, yet muſt keep an high cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and noble reſolution, not to be turned out of the path of Duty for the frowns of the greateſt; he muſt love his Brother but hate the ſin he commits; how many ſuch riddles are there in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? Now is it an eaſie work for the Chriſtian to drive his Charriot in ſo narrow a path, without juſtling one duty againſt another; to hold a fair and friendly correſpondence with all theſe duties, and not ſet one at variance with the other?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The great oppoſition the Chriſtian meets with in doing the Lords work, makes his labour ſtill greater. Other men can work in their Shops quietly, and few or none will moleſt them, much leſs throw ſtones at them;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97741:20"/>
but the Chriſtian he's hindred from all hands. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The fleſh within con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouls him, luſting againſt every good motion and holy action which the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God ſtirs him up unto; ſo that he is forced to diſpute his way before he can come at his work; much ado to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer what the fleſh objects againſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry duty he is to perform. Would he pray, then the fleſh begs time, and will be putting it off for a more convenient ſeaſon, ſome other buſineſs it ſtarts firſt to be done; would he give an Alms, the fleſh aſks him, whether he meaneth to be a beggar, and give that to others which himſelf may want before he dyes? would he reprove a ſinning Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then why will he be a buſie body in other mens matters, and loſe a Friend in doing a thankleſs office? would he bear witneſs to the Name and Goſpel of Chriſt, then pity thy ſelf is its counſel? no duty but it either keeps from it, or diſturbs in it; ſo that he needs a Sword as well as a Trowel to lay every ſtone in his Spiritual build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97741:21"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> A body of fleſh hangs heavy upon him; the body was at the firſt, and ſhall again be at laſt in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a wing; but now, alas, 'tis a weight to mans Soul, and that an heavy one; it ſhould indeed be the Souls ſervant, but now the Soul is fain to tend and wait upon that, to provide Food to keep, and Phyſick to reſtore its Health; yet when all is done, it proves no over meet help to the Soul; if it be ſtrong and healthy, then like a pamper'd Beaſt, it grows crank and wanton, ready to throw its rider, which made Saint <hi>Paul keep down his body</hi>; yet if the Soul diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline it but a little too ſeverely, then 'tis feeble and tyred. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The World, this makes no ſmall oppoſition. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The things of the world; the Chriſtians worldly calling is ready to filtch the time which ſhould be ſpent in the Chriſtians general; <hi>Martha</hi> is in the Kitching, when ſhe ſhould be in the Chappel; the enjoyments of the world, how enſnaring are they? ſenſual delights, ſo ſweet Wine, that when the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97741:21"/>
cup is at our lips, we cannot drink lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and ſo heady and intoxicating that we cannot bear much: when troubles come, how hard to keep from extremes, making too light of them, or thinking them too heavy; we are prone either to deſpiſe them, or to faint under them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The men of the world, theſe are oft a ſnare to draw the Chriſtian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin, ſometimes a whip in the Lords hand to ſcourge him for his ſins, but always a ſore vexation to the Chriſtian by their ſins. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The Prince of the world brings up the rear; he like a roaring Lion comes fell out of his Den, and runs full month at him: ſuch a bold and brazen faced Enemy, that he is not afraid or aſhamed to tempt the chaſteſt Soul to the fouleſt crimes: he that durſt tempt Chriſt himſelf to devil-worſhip and ſelf-murder, what will he not dare to attempt upon the beſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians? and he is as ſly as bold; an Art he hath of inſinuating and winding in his head before the Chriſtian can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his deſign; he hath more baits
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97741:22"/>
than one to his hook and knows how to fit every ones pallat; if he cannot make the Chriſtian wallow in the mire of fleſhly luſts, then he tempts to Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſins: if he will not be ſo prophane as to live without Religion, he'll try to make him an Hypocrite in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; if that ſucceed not, he'll try to blow him up into a proud conceipt of his Sincerity; if that will not do, he'll labour to abuſe his Humility into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and make him think worſe of himſelf than he is. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> He is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate and reſtleſs an enemy, as he is bold and ſly; like <hi>Marcellus</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Captain, of whom <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſaid, <hi>he was the oddeſt man he ever met with; for whether he did beat; or was beaten, he</hi> would not be quiet: if Satan gets a victory, he purſues it without mercy, never loſing an advantage given him; if he be worſted, he rallies and comes on again with more rage. Thus he dogs the Chriſtian to the laſt breath, and never leaves till the Chriſtian be got into Heaven it ſelf, where he cannot
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97741:22"/>
come at him. Now if any can go through all this work, and withſtand all this oppoſition without labour, or with but a little, he hath learnt an Art, and got a ſleight, which the reſt of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren never knew; and we may bid him, as the Emperour did <hi>Acctius,</hi> ſet up his ladder, and go to Heaven away by himſelf alone.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But why hath God charged his peoples work with ſo much labour, travel, and trouble?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. Firſt,</hi> Therefore they have ſo much labour here, becauſe they ſhall have none at all hereafter; they ſhall in Heaven reſt from their labours, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is fit they ſhould have ſome on Earth; otherwiſe, ſome Graces could never be exerciſed, and ſo their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency would not be known, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently might ſeem to be Created in vain; there reſulting from them neither benefit to the Saint, nor Glory to God. To name but one, how ſhould the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Grace of Patience (which ſhall have no occaſion for its exerciſe in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97741:23"/>
Heaven) be ever ſeen, if no part were given it to bring it upon the ſtage in this world? and what can diſcover Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, but labour and trouble? we had never heard of <hi>Job,</hi> probably, but for his Patience; and I am ſure we could never have heard of his Patience, if we had not alſo heard of his Tryals: indeed there is a great <hi>decorum</hi> in this diſpenſation, that the Chriſtian ſhould have his Patience tryed in this world, where God himſelf hath his own Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſo much exerciſed: that they ſhould endure ſome affliction from God, where God bears with ſo much ſin from them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> God doth this, that his people may give good proof of their high eſteem of the promiſed reward; it was an unſpeakable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> contempt which <hi>Adam</hi> caſt upon his happineſs to ſell it for a trifle; how could he more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize it? God therefore reſolved, that before he reſtored him, or any of his to their loſt happineſs, they ſhall firſt reſtore what he ſo vilified, to its due
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97741:23"/>
place in their eſtimation; and becauſe no more convincing Argument can be given of the high price we value Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at, than by the great labour we are willing to take, and trouble we are ready to endure for the obtaining of it; therefore he hath charged the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans work with ſo many labours and difficulties, that by our digeſting theſe, to obtain that, we may give, indeed, a real proof that we prize Heaven at a rate Superlative to all that is here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Thus <hi>Caleb</hi> ſhewed his high ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Canaan,</hi> when he was not cooled in his deſire of it, nor quailed in his courage with the high Walls, and high Gyants upon them, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the attempt difficult and hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous; but crys,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Numb.</hi> 13.30.</note> 
               <hi>Let us go up at once and poſſeſs it, for we are able to overcome it.</hi> Whereas the other faint-hearted <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are ſaid to <hi>deſpiſe the good land,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.31.</note> and why, but becauſe they valued their eaſe and ſafety at an higher rate than it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That he may make his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97741:24"/>
reſt in Heaven ſweeter when they come to it: There are three joys men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in <hi>Scripture,</hi> as the greateſt this world hath; the joy of Harveſt, the joy of Victory, and the joy of a Woman that hath brought forth a Man-child; now all theſe joys are uſhered in with great labour and travel; paſt troubles ſwell preſent joys; for beſides the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which is ſucked from the preſent good enjoyed, there is a further acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of joy made, from the remembrance of paſt labours and perils happily now conquered; the more hazardous the Battel was in the Fight, the more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Conqueror hath in his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. It would eaſe the damned of ſome of their ſorrow, could they forget the poſſibility they once had of being hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; and it would deprive the Saint of much of his acceſſory joy in Heaven, did he not remember the danger he once had of falling into that miſery, which there he needs not fear.</p>
            <p>I ſhall apply this Point only to two ſorts of Perſons. <hi>Firſt,</hi> To thoſe that have
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97741:24"/>
ſlighty thoughts of Religion, who think it an eaſie thing to be a Chriſtian here, and no hard matter to be ſaved hereafter, <hi>Secondly,</hi> To thoſe that are ſo far from believing it thus eaſie, that (through the ſuffuſion of Melancholy and Satans Art, who thickens this dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) apprehend it ſo hard a labour, as renders it next to impoſſible; whereby they are diſpirited from making any vigorous endeavours in Religion, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they ſhall never overcome the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties which attend it; and as good they think it is to ſet ſtill, as riſing to fall deeper at laſt into condemnation. Thus, the Ship cannot ſail if it hath no wind, or too ſtrong and violent a one. My deſire is to undeceive thoſe, and thereby to do a kindneſs to them both. Thoſe that think it ſo eaſie to be a Chriſtian, no hard matter to obtain Salvation; I would endeavour to ſhew theſe what a deluſion they are under, and danger they run, by fancying the Bridge to. Heaven wider than it is: But where, may ſome ſay, dwell theſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97741:25"/>
Men I am now directing my ſpeech un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to? I wiſh they did not ſwarm every where, and made not the greateſt number in moſt of our Towns and Congregations. I ſhall point at a few: <hi>Firſt,</hi> He that conceits himſelf a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and nouriſheth in him an hope of Salvation, even whilſt his life is prophane, he, no doubt, thinks it too eaſie to be a Chriſtian; when a man ſhall think Chriſt will own him as his, meerly for his Chriſtian name, and not reject him for his Heatheniſh Practices, thinks that his heart is good, though his life be wicked; whereas his life could not be wicked, if his heart was not ſo (for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh) when men ſhall think they are Gods Servants, though they be the Devils Labourers; that God is their Friend, when they declare themſelves every day his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. In a word, to think they ſhall leap at death, <hi>è coeno in coelum,</hi> out of <hi>Delilahs</hi> lap, into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſom; is not this to make it an eaſie thing to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97741:25"/>
be a Chriſtian, and no hard matter to be ſaved? and where is any one (who hath not firſt been convinced from ſome work of the Spirit) ſo bad, that is not yet thus kind to himſelf? yea, have they not commonly the ſtrongeſt Faith, who have the weakeſt Grounds for it? they build up <hi>Sion</hi> with blood, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet will they lean upon the Lord,<note place="margin">Mic. <hi>3.</hi>
               </note> and ſay, is not the Lord amongſt us, none evil can come upon us? Who knocks more boldly at Heaven Gate to be let in, than they whom Chriſt will reject as workers of iniquity? O what a deluſion is this! <hi>Caligula</hi> never made himſelf more ridiculous, than when he would be honoured as a God, while he lived more like a Devil. Before you would have others take you for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, for Gods ſake, prove your ſelves men, and not beaſts, as you do by your bruitiſh lives. Talk not of your hopes of Salvation, ſo long as the marks of Damnation are ſeen upon your flagiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lives. If the way to Heaven were
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97741:26"/>
thus eaſie, I promiſe you the Saints in all Ages have been much over-ſeen, to take ſo great pains in mortifying their luſts, in denying to ſatisfie their ſenſual appetite, <hi>ad quid perditio haec,</hi> to what purpoſe did they make ſo much waſte of their ſweat in their zealous ſerving God? and of their tears, that they could ſerve him no better, if they might have gone to Heaven, as theſe men hope to do? That <hi>Fryar</hi> was far more ſound in his judgment, in this Point, who Preaching at <hi>Rome</hi> one Lent, when ſome <hi>Cardinals,</hi> and many other great ones were preſent, began his Sermon thus abruptly and Ironically. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was a Fool, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was a Fool, and all the Primitive Chriſtians were Fools; for they thought the way to Heaven was by Prayers and Tears, Watchings and Faſtings, ſeverities of Mortification, and denying the pomp and glory of this World. Whereas you here in <hi>Rome,</hi> ſpend your time in Balls and Masks, live in Pomp and Pride, Luſt and Luxury, and yet count your ſelves
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97741:26"/>
good Chriſtians, and hope to be ſaved: but at laſt you will prove the Fools, and they will be found to have been the Wiſe men. Did ever any man ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at <hi>London</hi> by going from it? eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſin is a ſtep from God, and the more we ſin, the further we depart from God. Doth not he then take a wiſe courſe to come at laſt to the full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God in Heaven, who by a lend wicked life runs as far from him, as his legs can carry him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They who think they are good Chriſtians, and fair enough for Heaven, though they have no more then a Negative Holineſs; the beſt that can be ſaid of them, is, they are not ſo bad as the worſt; they do not take ſo much pains for Hell as others; but none for Heaven; they labour not ſo much in the Devils work; but work not at all for God: like thoſe in the Goſpel, they <hi>ſtand idle all the day long,</hi> and yet hope for a peny at night, though they never entred into Chriſts Vineyard: they are ſo far from labouring in the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97741:27"/>
work of the Lord, that they will not touch his work with one of their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Do not theſe think it very eaſie to be Chriſtians? as if God was bound to ſave them, but they not bound to ſerve them. Is not Heaven called a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward? and what reward can be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed where no work is done? if ſome that work ſhall be denyed all reward, becauſe they did not labour at it; and ſome ſeek, that ſhall not be able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; becauſe they do not ſtrive; then miſerable muſt thy condition be, who falleſt ſhort of thoſe, who themſelves fall ſhort of Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, Formaliſts</hi> and ſlothful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; and how many are theſe? who will not be Atheiſts to live without all Religion, but reſolve not to be Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots. They are more then key-cold, but are afraid to be too hot in their work; they are not idle, but cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to be diligent; they love ſuch a temper in Religion for their Souls, as they do a Climate for their Bodies to live in; it muſt be a very temperate one;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97741:27"/>
afraid to exceed only in Piety and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, in which alone there can be no exceſs. Oh what a deluſion is this! he that will chuſe another temper for his Religion, than God hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, had need provide another Heaven for himſelf, than God hath prepared; for that is given to the zealous Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, not the lazie Loiterer. The violent are they which take this Kingdom by force; a man may be ſure of Hell with a little pains, but Heaven will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be loſt without our labour and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: and the reaſon is, becauſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is born in a ſtate of ſin and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and ſo needs no more than to fit ſtill in that ſtate, to bring inevitable deſtruction upon him; to Hell he will come ſoon enough, though he gallop not ſo faſt as others in riot and exceſs. But, alas, we are born afar off from God and Heaven; much labour is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to get into the way that leads to life Eternal; and when we are in it, many a weary ſtep to take, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of work to diſpatch; ſins to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97741:28"/>
temptations to reſiſt, afflictions to endure, impaired Graces to repair, weak to ſtrengthen, and to perſevere in all this labour, till death it ſelf takes us off. This we muſt do, or elſe (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of their abiding in the Ship) we cannot be ſaved. It is with the Chriſtians Spiritual Life, (in this reſpect) as with his natural; his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hath within it ſelf, that which is ſufficient to cauſe the death of it, but not to maintain its life. This proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is without; as a man, he will dye, though he make no uſe of knife or hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to diſpatch himſelf: not taking food, or not uſing phyſick will do it alone: Thus the Chriſtian hath enough within him to procure his Spiritual death, and conſequently his Eternal; but not to maintain his Spiritual life. The proviſion for this is out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>his ſufficiency is of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. and this ſufficiency God gives not in an immediate way, but by appointed means, which he requireth their care to make uſe of (as he did the <hi>Iſraelites
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97741:28"/>
hands,</hi> to gather and bake their <hi>Manna)</hi> and ſo by bleſſing his means, and their care in uſing of it, their Spiritual life is preſerved and nouriſhed unto Eternal life. Now, when any ſhall thus extend his care to the uſe of all appointed means, and intend the faculties of his Soul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly (as he ought) in the uſe of them, and ſhall have continued ſome conſiderable time in this exerciſe; then, and not till then, will he be a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent judge, to tell us whether it be a ſlighty buſineſs, to be a Chriſtian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed or not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> A few words to thoſe who will acknowledge the labour of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity to be great; but that is it which is their diſcouragement, and ſcares them from entring into that ſervice, which will coſt ſo much pains, and bring ſo much trouble. I ſhall leave ſome Conſiderations to be pondered by them, which, I hope, may eaſe them of this too deep an apprehenſion of the Chriſtians labour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Chriſtianity, 'tis confeſt, is a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:97741:29"/>
labour, but a neceſſary labour; it is not, indeed, the part of a wiſe man, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or hazard much for that he little needs; yet for ſuch things is it (God knows) that moſt men beſtow their greateſt toyl and travel; to obtain that which they may have (<hi>ſpecie aut valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi>) and ſpare this their pains alſo; as <hi>Cyneas</hi> told <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> when he ſaid, after ſuch and ſuch Kingdoms Conquered by him, then we will ſit down and live a merry life. But why, quoth <hi>Cyneas,</hi> may we not do that already without all this trouble? I confeſs (conſidering the preſent frame of Carnal mens hearts) they are under a kind of neceſſity of what they inordinately deſire. The Covetous man muſt have his Gold, the Voluptuous man his Pleaſures; or elſe they cannot enjoy themſelves: but this neceſſity is no other than that of a Dropſie man, for his unmeaſurable drinking; for was this mans diſeaſe, and the other mans luſts purged out, both their neceſſities would ceaſe alike; but Heaven is abſolutely neceſſary to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97741:29"/>
all, whether they think ſo or no. Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we had the Soul of a Beaſt, than having the Soul of a Man, not to have at laſt that perfection and happineſs, for which this Immortal Soul was made. And this thou canſt not have, except thou wilt take the pains to walk in the ways of Holineſs, which lead to it; thy Soul (poor man) is haſtning apace to its laſt and eternal ſtate, which will be either in Heaven or Hell: the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the one invaluable, the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the other intollerable, and both interminable. If thou beſtirreſt not thy ſelf, and that timely, to take hold of Eternal Life, Hell is at thy back to take hold of thee. Now is there any room left in this caſe for deliberation, when <hi>de vitâ aut morte aeternâ agitur?</hi> is it now time to ſay, ſhall I labour to be ſaved, or ſhall I not? It may in ſome caſes be more eligible to loſe our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral life, than to be at pains to ſave it. If <hi>Caeſar</hi> told the Marriner, in a ſtorm, <hi>it was neceſſary he ſhould ſail, not that he ſhould live</hi>; then ſurely with
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97741:30"/>
much more reaſon may the Chriſtian ſay; yea, muſt he ſay, it is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry I live here, but 'tis neceſſary while I live, that I perform the voyage God hath impoſed on me; that I launch forth into his ſervice, whereby I may make ſure of Eternal Life, though with the loſs of my Temporal. But no worldly neceſſity can be ſuch, as ſhould controul our care in the other. Get Eternal Life, and thou wilt find again that life thou didſt loſe in getting it; but loſe Heaven, and in Hell thou wilt ſee all thoſe paltry gains loſt, to keep which a while, thou didſt loſe Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider, the greateſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and trouble the ſervice of God will put thee to, is incomparably leſs, than the leaſt pain the ſinner ſhall find and feel in Hell. What is the trouble a Chriſtian is at in Mortifying a Luſt here, to the torment which the enraged Conſcience of a Damued Soul will put him to there, for not Mortifying of it when time was? what is the ſorrow which the Saint feels here, whilſt he
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:97741:30"/>
mourns for his ſins in hope of pardon, to the horror of a Reprobrate anguiſh in Hell, imbittered with deſpair: what is the Chriſtians loſs to part with his Temporals for Chriſts ſake, to the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners parting with God and Heaven, never to ſee his bleſſed face more? in a word, what are the flouts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches which the Saint hath from a wicked world, to the Sinners portion; when God, with all the Holy Angels and Saints, ſhall laugh at their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If the love of Heaven will not move you to ſubmit to the ſhort labour which attends the ſervice of God, let the fear of Hell do it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Though the Chriſtians la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour be hard, yet there are many things alleviate the burden of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The ſumbleneſs of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans work to his renewed Nature; the trouble of a work is much as the mans mind ſtands to or againſt it. It would be a tedious buſineſs to an ignorant Ruſtick, to be locked up in a Scholars Study, and there be made to ſpend his
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97741:31"/>
time amongſt his Books; but the true Scholar needs not be forced or wager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this work; his delight in it, takes away the labour of it; <hi>non inveni</hi> (ſaid one) <hi>in hoc mundo requiem niſi in angulo cum libello</hi>; it were a great calamity, to a ſlothful daſtardly ſpirit, to be made to endure the labour and hardſhip of a Souldier: whereas a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Soul, would prefer it before eaſe and gain at home; <hi>mea ſit laborum major pars, pecuniâ autem, abundet quis volet,</hi> was <hi>Achilles</hi> his ſpeech; give me the labour, let who will take the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. To a ſenſual heart, what more unpleaſing then Heavenly Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? yet what more delighted <hi>David?</hi> To a carnal heart, the Commandments of God are all hard ſayings, becauſe, contrary to his unholy nature: but to a Gracious Soul, none of them are grievous; he loves the Law of God from the ſame reaſon, for which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hates it, <hi>becauſe it is pure;</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to do the Will of God, becauſe he hath a law within him, which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponds
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97741:31"/>
with the law without; his Heart anſwers to it, as the eccho to the voice; thou <hi>ſaidſt ſeek my face, thy face will I ſeek:</hi> No wonder a Croſs lies heavy upon his ſhoulders, that hath no Faith in God to ſuſtain him under it; but a <hi>Paul,</hi> he can <hi>take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in infirmities, in reproaches, in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Divine aſſiſtances which the Chriſtian hath in his work, alleviates the labour of it; conſider the Chriſtians work without this help, 'tis heavy indeed, yea, too heavy for him to ſtand under; but Gods helping hand put to it, makes this heavy work light. The Ship, which when lying on ground, all the Teams in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try could not draw off; how eaſily is it ſet a float when the Tide comes in? Thus the Heart which the Chriſtian, by no pains and induſtry of his own, can raiſe out of its dullneſs and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to Duty? Oh how ſoon is it elevated and inſpirited, when God flows in with his ſecret Aſpirations
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97741:32"/>
and Exuſcitations of his Bleſſed Spirit and Grace! he who confeſſed that he could do nothing of himſelf, not ſo much as think a good thought, tells us alſo, he is able to do all things through Chriſt who ſtrengthneth him: now this help from the Lord is promiſed; but it comes not till the Chriſtians hand is put to the work; let him be up and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and then God will not fail to be with him. 'Tis cheap travelling (we ſay) for a Child in his Fathers compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: to be ſure God will pay the charge the Chriſtian is at in his whole jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to Heaven; it is eaſie working while God holds our hand, yea, puts ſtrength into it. Art thou to pray his Spirit will lift with thee, for ſo that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſignifies, art thou tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? whilſt thou art fighting in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley below, Chriſts hands are lift up in Heaven above for thy Victory. <hi>I have prayed that thy Faith fail not</hi>; yea he doth not only pray above for thee, but will be in the Field with thee, and in thee, by the ſecret ſuccours of his
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:97741:32"/>
Spirit. <hi>My Grace is ſufficient for thee,</hi> which is not meant of Grace Inherent in us; that indeed is unſufficient of it ſelf; but the auxiliary Grace, which he ſends in to aſſiſt and excite that in a time of need.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Though Chriſtianity be a labour, and many troubles and perils at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it, yet 'tis not alike to all: every Chriſtian hath not <hi>Hemans</hi> Faith, <hi>Jobs</hi> Patience, or <hi>Pauls</hi> Courage; neither ſhall all have <hi>Hemans</hi> Diſertions, <hi>Jobs</hi> Loſſes, nor <hi>Pauls</hi> Perſecutions; the ſtouteſt Souldiers are put upon the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſervice; the heavieſt burden upon the ſtrongeſt back: he knows every Saints ability, and ſo he rates them; <hi>he will not ſuffer any to be tempted above that they are able.</hi> When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> came firſt out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he knew they were raw Souldiers, and therefore led them about, that they might not be put to fight, before he had hardned, and heartned them more to bear ſuch a work. While Chriſt was upon Earth, he interpoſed his own body between
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:97741:33"/>
his weak Diſciples, and the fury of the wicked world: but when he went to Heaven, then he ventured them into the ſtorm, but careful firſt to re-inforce them with power from above, before he let them take the Field, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.4. <hi>Being aſſembled together with them, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them that they ſhould not depart from</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>but wait for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The merciful indulgence which the Lord gives them as to their failings: hard work, indeed, God calls them to, but the harder the work is, the more his pity is expreſſed towards them; in pardoning thoſe invincible infirmities, which notwithſtanding their faithful endeavour, will be found in their doing it. It was hard for the <hi>Apostles</hi> to keep their eyes wakeful in the dead of the night; Chriſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth this, and Apologizeth for them, even while he chides them; <hi>the Spirit is willing, but the Fleſh is weak.</hi> It is hard when Afflictions are ſtrong, and long, not to fall into ſome indecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97741:33"/>
of ſpeech and behaviour: we have heard of <hi>Jobs</hi> Impatience, as well as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, yet the Lord was graciouſly pleaſed to to take his part againſt his accuſing Friends; <hi>ye have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right, as my ſervant</hi> Job <hi>hath, Job</hi> 42.7. It is hard to act Faith, when ſenſe and reaſon are non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſt; the Lord therefore is pleaſed to overlook the weakneſſes of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens faith, which in ſuch deep plunges they bewray, ſo they ſtrive againſt them, and be humbled for them; <hi>in magnis tentaſſe aliquid, non parvum,</hi> in great and difficult enterprizes, an eſſay and endeavour is not little: <hi>Peter</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great Faith in venturing to go up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sea, but diſcovered infirmity when he began to ſink; therefore Chriſt pitieth and ſuccoureth his weakneſs. <hi>Davids</hi> ſtrait was in a manner as great at Land, as <hi>Peters</hi> was at Sea. When at <hi>Gath</hi> amongſt his Enemies, whoſe Champion he had ſlain; much fear and unbelief he borrowed in this his ſtrait, yet ſome ſecret actings of Faith were
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:97741:34"/>
mingled with theſe his fears, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Prayer he then lift up to God; and even this Prayer attended with ſo many diſtruſtful fears, found acceptance with God; which made the good man bring this forth as an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement for others; <hi>This poor man cryed, and the Lord heard him, and ſaved him out of all his Troubles,</hi> Pſalm 34.6. A poor man, indeed, he was at this time, not only in his outward ſtate, but his inward; poor and low in the actings of his Faith. O what encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement is here to come into the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God; hard work thou mayſt meet with, but not an hard Maſter; do but thou thy beſt, and God will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give thy worſt. Beware of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in not doing what thou canſt, and God will not reject thee for thy weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; <hi>Like as a Father pitieth his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſo the Lord pitieth them that fear him,</hi> Pſalm 103.13.</p>
            <p>I come now to the Second Part of the Text, which preſents us with the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97741:34"/>
reward that attends the Chriſtians la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; <hi>it is not in vain in the Lord</hi>; they ſhall not be put off with their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for their pains: no, there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward laid up in Heaven, which will abundantly compenſate all the pain and pains they were put to on Earth; but we muſt not underſtand this, as if the Chriſtian received no gain or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, in this life, from the ſervice of God, while he is labouring in it: <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs hath the promiſe of this life, as well as the other.</hi> There are promiſes of which payment is made here; and though theſe be inferiour to what the Chriſtian ſhall receive hereafter; yet be they ſo pretious, as prove Religion even in this life, no <hi>hoſpes aſymbolus.</hi> No gueſt that lodgeth on free coſt, but ſuch as pays well, and that in preſent Coin for its entertainment. It affords Bread to the eater, as well as Seed to the ſower; there is fruit unto Holineſs, which the Chriſtian may now feed on to his comfort, as well as an hope of Eternal life to be received at the end
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:97741:35"/>
of this. The very vales which the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian hath given him, while at his work, afford him enough for his preſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, to maintain him in a port be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming his high hopes for afterwards. <hi>Firſt,</hi> His conſcionable labour in the Lords work, will gain him more abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and holy skill to do his work ſtill better; by exerciſing of himſelf daily unto Godlineſs, he becomes more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and prepared for every good work; by daily combating with his corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and reſiſting temptations, he learns more eaſily to overcome his Enemy. And if in worldly trades this be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a ſufficient reward to an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice, for ſerving out his time, to learn the myſtery of his Calling; Oh what a reward is it, by the daily pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Godlineſs, to learn more fully the Myſtery of it? This I am ſure holy <hi>David</hi> ſet down for great gains, <hi>I have remembred thy name, O Lord, in the night, and have kept thy Law; this I had becauſe I kept thy Precepts,</hi> Pſal. 119.55. And again, <hi>I underſtand more than the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:97741:35"/>
Ancients, becauſe I kept thy Precepts,</hi> ver. 100. He did not grudge his own pains, nor envy others eaſe, ſo long as he might get more Heavenly Wiſdom by it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Chriſtians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable labour, intereſſeth him in the ſpecial Providence of God for him: while he is at work for God, God will take care of him; and what can he want, that hath God for his Provider? what, or whom need he fear, that hath God for his Protector? For though all the Saints have a right in Promiſes, yet none have a pleaſant aptitude to apply the comfort of any one Promiſe, while they are idle and negligent; no, this is the portion of the laborious Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, that walks in the actual exerciſe of his Grace: <hi>No good thing ſhall he want that walks uprightly.</hi> When God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth to <hi>Abraham</hi> his Almightineſs, it is to him, as <hi>walking before him,</hi> not as ſitting in the chair of ſloth. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Chriſtians labour is rewarded here with inward peace of Conſcience, and ſerenity of Mind; <hi>Great peace have they
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97741:36"/>
that keep thy Law, and nothing ſhall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them,</hi> Pſalm 119.166. <hi>Peace be on them that walk by this rule, as on the</hi> Iſrael <hi>of God,</hi> Gal. 6. Theſe are they, in whoſe boſoms this Bird of Paradiſe ſings her ſweet Notes, and her ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in fouleſt weather; when ſickneſs comes, and death approacheth. Now he that hath the teſtimony of his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for having been a faithful La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer in the Lords work, will be able to make a comfortable reflection upon his paſt life: For mens expectations of what is coming to them at death, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon what their paſt lives have been. Life is the time of ſowing, and death of reaping; as they have ſown, ſo only can they expect to reap. Life is a time for working, and death for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the reward, ſutable to the work. Hence it is, when death is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, Conſcience (if not ſeared, and paſt all feeling) is then carried back to review what the man hath been do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for whom he hath been labouring; and therefore muſt needs bring in heavy
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:97741:36"/>
tidings to the ſinner of his approaching miſery; then it rips up all the ſtitches of that falſe peace, which the ungodly wretch had been bolſtred up with, and tells him, that now the Righteous Judge is at hand, to pay him the diſmal wages due to him, for all the wicked works he hath done, which makes the thoughts of death a terror to him. But the Sincere Chriſtian, who hath laboured faithfully in the Lords work; he then hath a pleaſant Proſpect to behold, when he looks back upon his conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable walking, and can thence make his humble appeal to God, and deſire him to remember how he hath walked before him in Truth, and with a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Heart. Oh what joy is this to his poor heart, that his Conſcience bears him witneſs, he hath endeavoured to walk before God, with godly ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and not in guile? and can caſt himſelf upon the Mercy of God in Chriſt, and breathe out his Soul with a joyful expectation, of being received into the Kingdom of Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:97741:37"/>This premiſed, I addreſs my ſelf to ſpeak of the Chriſtians reward in the other world, this being principally (if not ſolely) in the Text; where it is ſet forth two ways. <hi>Firſt,</hi> By its cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, <hi>For as much as ye know. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> By its tranſcendency, <hi>Your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is not in vain in the Lord.</hi> In which words, you may remember, I told you there is more intended, than expreſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> of the <hi>firſt,</hi> The certainty of the Saints reward intimated by this Phraſe, <hi>ye know</hi>: that is, ye know it for a certain indubitable truth; ye make no doubt of this: thus is the Saints future Happineſs ſpoke of, with the greateſt aſſurance and certainty; <hi>We know that if our earthly houſe of his Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle were diſſolved, we have a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, Eternal in the Heavens,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.1. <hi>We know that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him.</hi> The Saints know this ſo well,<note place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3.</note> that they dare venture the loſs of all they are worth here, for the reward they expect
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:97741:37"/>
there: <hi>Ye took joyfully the ſpoiling of your goods, knowing in your ſelves, that ye have in Heaven a more enduring ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> Heb. 10.34. yea, they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed their temporal life, when offered to the prejudice of their eternal, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35. <hi>Not accepting Deliverance, that they might obtain a better Reſurrection.</hi> If any ſhould ask, how do they know ſo aſſuredly there is this reward? I would ask ſuch, how they know the Sun to be, when they ſee it ſhine? if they ſay, by ſeeing of it; they may know, that the Saint ſees an Heaven, as certainly, by an eye of Faith, as they can do the Sun, by an eye of Senſe; <hi>Faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not ſeen.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hebr. <hi>11.1.</hi>
               </note> The very light of nature, whereby the Heathens knew a God, did let with it into their minds, ſome knowledge of another world, and of a double ſtate therein; of happineſs to the good, and miſery to the wicked; being not able, otherwiſe, to reconcile the uneven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Providence in this world, with
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97741:38"/>
the righteous nature of God: but alas, what was this leſſer light which God left in man to rule him, in the night of Heatheniſh darkneſs, to the certainty of the Saints knowledge, which comes in by the light of Faith? <hi>firſt,</hi> the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Faith is grounded on the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of God himſelf, in his word. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Faith is, indeed the weakeſt, and moſt uncertain kind of knowledge; becauſe mans teſtimony, on which it relys, is ſo fallible; but Divine Faith the moſt certain, becauſe the teſtimony of God, on which its weight bears, is infallible: One, who cannot deceive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is truth it ſelf; nor be deceived, becauſe he is wiſdom it ſelf: So that, though Faith be not Reaſon, yet to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what God ſaith is true, there is the higheſt reaſon. 2<hi>ly,</hi> As the teſtimony on which the Saints Faith relies, is the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Word of God; ſo his very Faith which relies on this Word of God, is no other than the work of God; the ſame Spirit, who is the Author of that, is the efficient of this; for the Chriſtian believes
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:97741:38"/>
not from the power of his own will, but the power of God, mightily working his heart up to this ſupernatural act. Hence we are ſaid to be <hi>ſaved through Faith, and that not of our ſelves, it is the gift of God,</hi> Epheſ. 2.8. And this Faith is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>a Faith of the operation of God, Coloſ.</hi> 2.12. 'tis wrought in us, not by us. Not only the light of truth which the Chriſtian ſees is Divine, but the eye of Faith by which he ſees, this light is Divine alſo; how certain muſt that knowledge be, which in the light of Gods Spirit, beholds the light of Gods Truth? now from this Word of God, the Chriſtian is aſſured of this reward many ways. <hi>Firſt,</hi> He is aſſured of it, by Jeſus Chriſt, who, himſelf, came from Heaven, and makes report there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; <hi>In my Fathers houſe are many Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, if it were not ſo, I would have told you,</hi> John 14.2. As if he had ſaid, you may belief me, for I ſpeak it, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lye; and who loves you too well to put a cheat upon you. That there are ſuch Countries as <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:97741:39"/>
you do not doubt, though you never ſaw them, becauſe ſome that have, aſſure you it is true: and ſhall the Saint be blamed for relying on Chriſts own faithful Word? who <hi>cometh from Heaven, is above all, and what he hath ſeen and heard, that he teſtifyeth,</hi> John 3.32. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Chriſtian knows it, by the purchaſe Chriſt hath made of Heaven for Believers. Mans ſin had ſhut Heaven door againſt him, and opened Death and Hells door upon him: now before God would (or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed could) ſet open again this door of life to poor ſinners, it was neceſſary that his Glory ſhould firſt be ſecured; which to do, this admirable expedient, the Divine Wiſdom contrived, that Chriſt ſhould dye for ſinners, by which, both Death, the puniſhment of mans ſin, might be aboliſhed; and life, and immortality, which man had loſt, might be reſtored, and brought to light again, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. Hence it is ſaid, <hi>It became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:97741:39"/>
Sons unto Glory, to make the Captain of their Salvation perfect through ſufferings, Heb.</hi> 2.10. Mark that, <hi>it became him</hi>; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, there was a condecency for God thus to do. God never doth any thing that doth not become him; in all his works he acts like himſelf; every work declaring his Glory, but not all alike. Now God in the Redemption of the world, intending to make the greateſt manifeſtation of his Glory, that ever he did: It became him to pitch on ſuch a means, as was ſutable to ſuch an end; and this of bringing his People to Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by the abaſement of his own Son, to an ignominious and curſed death, was the expedient he reſolved upon, as every way condecent to this deſign; and indeed, never did all the Divine Attributes appear in all their Glory, ſo as they do here. According there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to this Eternal Council of Gods Will and Love, in the fullneſs of time, the Son of God was cloathed with our Fleſh, laid down his life, took it up again; and further, to ſhew he had got
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:97741:40"/>
a full triumph over death, and had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened Heaven gates for Believers. He opened the Graves of many of the dead Saints, and raiſed them to life, as a pledge, that he would do the ſame, in due time, for the reſt. So that now to doubt, whether there be an Eternal life for the Saints after death, is to make the whole Goſpel a fiction. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They know it by the actual poſſeſſion which Chriſt hath already taken of Heaven for them. A Child thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſure of an Eſtate, when his Father not only purchaſeth it, but alſo taketh it up for him. Thus did Chriſt aſcend to Heaven, not only to ſit down on his own Throne, but to take and keep poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Heaven, for the behoof and benefit of Believers. Hence they are ſaid, to <hi>ſit together in Heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus</hi>;<note place="margin">Eph. <hi>2.</hi>
               </note> that is, in him as their head, which is a certain pledge to them; they ſhall one day ſit with him there, in their own perſons: <hi>Becauſe I live</hi> (ſaith <hi>Chriſt) ye ſhall live alſo.</hi> Indeed he lives there to make Interceſſion for them, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:97741:40"/>
will never leave praying, till he hath prayed them up unto himſelf. I may ſay to Believers, as once <hi>Naomi</hi> to <hi>Ruth, ſit ſtill for the man will not ceaſe, till he hath fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the thing:</hi> Chriſt will not ceaſe his Mediatory work, till he hath finiſhed his peoples happineſs, and got his betrothed Spouſe home to him, in his Fathers houſe. 4<hi>ly,</hi> He knows the certainty of this happy eſtate, by the many expreſs Promiſes made to Believers of it. I cannot num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them they are ſo many, neither need I name them; there being no Child of God ſo little (I hope) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, with his Saviours Will and Teſtament, as not to be able to turn on a ſudden to many places, where this Inheritance is ſetled on them. The greateſt Heir that lives, is the Saint. He is heir to both Worlds, having <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come:</hi> But the grand pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of all is, that which gives him ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to his Heavenly Inheritance.<note place="margin">
                  <p>
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14.</p>
               </note> In one place they are called <hi>Heirs of Promiſe,</hi> in another, <hi>Heirs of Salvation</hi>; becauſe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:97741:41"/>
this is the Crowning Promiſe. Heaven it is called their <hi>Hope,</hi> till this comes; he hath not his Portion; all he hath here, is the leaſt of what is promiſed. But when Heaven comes, then all is paid; the Bond then is delivered in, Faith and Hopes work is done. The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, who on Earth, believes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects Promiſes, ſhall in Heaven inherit Promiſes; there Faith ſhall be turned into Viſion, and Hope ſwallowed up in Fruition. Now though nothing can make Heaven more ſure to the Believer, than Gods Promiſe, no not the Oath of God it ſelf, becauſe it is as impoſſible for God to lye without an Oath, as with it; for <hi>being he can ſwear by no greater, he ſweareth only by himſelf</hi>; and ſo the ſtrength even of his Oath, lyeth in his Veracity, which is engaged in his Promiſe, as well as Oath: yet he is graciouſly pleaſed, <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> conſulting therein with our frailty, to ſuperadd all thoſe things to his Promiſe; by which men in contracts, amongſt themſelves, do conceive a further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:97741:41"/>
and ſecurity to to be given, for performance of their Promiſes one to another; as witneſſes, Seal, Oath, and Earneſt; that having theſe Securities, which are wont to ſatisfie us in Humane Promiſes, the ſin of diſtruſting Gods performance of his, might appear the more unreaſonable in us, and injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to him: as, indeed, it is beyond all expreſſion, when thoſe Securities will not aſſure our hearts, concerning the performance of Gods Promiſes, than which we cannot exact more from thoſe men that are moſt unreſponſable or deceitful.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Saints reward is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by its Tranſcendency; <hi>your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is not in vain in the Lord.</hi> In the explication of which Phraſe, I ſhewed, that there is more implyed, than is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt. That the Chriſtians labour ſhall be highly, unſpeakably rewarded, the place where the reward is laid up, proves the tranſcendency of it, and that is Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. <hi>Ye have in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a better, and an enduring ſubſtance</hi>;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:97741:42"/>
and Heaven is a place ſo excellent, as renders it uncapable of an hyperbole; not ſo far above our heads, as it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove our thoughts: <hi>It hath not entred into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> One may as eaſily draw in all the Air of the world at a breath, as expreſs, or conceive, how great and glorious the Saints reward in Heaven is. As it is, <hi>praemium reconditum pro nobis</hi>; ſo it is, <hi>abſconditum à nobis,</hi> as it is laid up for Believers, ſo it is hid from them. <hi>We are now the Sons of God, but we know not what we ſhall be.</hi> The Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares our apprehenſions of Heaven here, to the low apprehenſions, which little children have of mens affairs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. which you know is very low. That Saint which knew leaſt of Heaven, while on Earth, did the firſt moment he entred into that Glorious place, underſtand more of it, than all the Doctors of the Church ever did, or could, whilſt on Earth: The Scripture therefore preſents it to us, as an object
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:97741:42"/>
of our admiration, not comprehenſion. <hi>O how great things hath God laid up for them that fear him?</hi> Pſalm 31. When Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had ſet forth the Saints Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, in that Golden chain of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>whom he predeſtinated, them he called, whom he called, them he alſo juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified</hi>; breaks forth like a man in an Extaſie, <hi>What ſhall we ſay to theſe things?</hi> expreſſing thereby his inabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to expreſs the greatneſs and glory of them. Yet ſo much the Saints know of this bleſſed ſtate that waits for them, as will not ſuffer them to admire any thing they ſee here below, any more, than he would the light of a Glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm, who hath ſeen the Sun. I ſhall content my ſelf at this time, in ſetting forth the Tranſcendency of that Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs the Saints ſhall receive as their reward in Heaven, after their labour is finiſhed on Earth. To conſider, <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Properties of that Bleſſed ſtate, to which they ſhall be advanced in Heaven. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To compare the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:97741:43"/>
Saints work and labour on Earth, with this their reward in Heaven. <hi>Firſt</hi> of the <hi>firſt,</hi> The Properties of that Bleſſed ſtate with which their labour ſhall be rewarded in Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is a ſtate purely Spiritual. The Saints ſtate on earth, is partly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and partly Animal. He ceaſeth not to be a Mortal Creature, when he becomes a new Creature: his life is Spiritual as a Saint, but Animal as a mortal Man: and ſo his comforts and refreſhings, are Animal, as well as Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual. He eats, he drinks, he ſleeps; and all theſe acts of Nature have a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and ſweetneſs proper to their kind, which is too low for that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed ſtate, to which they ſhall there be exalted; they ſhall need neither meat, nor drink, where there is no hunger, nor thirſt; no time there loſt in ſleep, where the Body ſhall never be weary, nor drowſie, but be as wakeful as the Soul: no need of cloaths, where there ſhall be no ſhame, where the body it ſelf, ſhall out-ſhine the Sun in its noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:97741:43"/>
glory. And is it not more deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to be without theſe, than to need them and have them? to have ſound legs, then to be lame, and have crutches? who had not rather have been with <hi>Moſes,</hi> beholding the face of God in the Mount (though all that time without food) than Feaſting with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at the bottom of the Hill? ſurely Spiritual Pleaſures are more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſweet, than bodily; or elſe we might ſay, that Senſual men have more joy and pleaſure in their life, than God hath in his.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is an accumulative ſtate, wherein there is an aggregation, and concentration, of all thoſe things, which are requiſite to make their happineſs compleat; it is not <hi>Eſaus</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> but <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> not having much, but having all will make man happy. <hi>Are here all thy Children?</hi> ſaid <hi>Samuel</hi> unto <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> and would not ſit down to the Feaſt,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.11.</note> till <hi>David,</hi> the only one wanting was come. Thus mans Soul cannot ſit down to its Feaſt, and be ſatisfyed, till
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:97741:44"/>
it hath all that goeth to its Perfection; the abſence of any one Ingredient, keeps it in motion, looking and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it; and that is inconſiſtent with compleat happineſs, which conſiſts in reſt ariſing from ſatisfaction. Now in Heaven, there is a confluence of all, that the Saint, even then, when his faculties will be ſtretched out and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged to their utmoſt capacity, can poſſibly deſire; <hi>He that overcometh ſhall inherit all things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.7.</note> 
               <hi>and I will be his God.</hi> The glorifyed Saint hath above him, the beatifying Viſion of God himſelf, and Jeſus Chriſt, the purchaſer of all his Felicity, whom he ſo loved on Earth, and longed to ſee. Within him he ſhall behold his own Soul, made perfect in all its noble Powers, ſatisfyed with the Image of God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.15.</note> as full of Holineſs as it can hold. Upon him he ſhall ſee that body, which was once ſo vile and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, made Immortal, Spiritual, and Glorious, even like the Glorious body of Chriſt, the exemplar cauſe, after which it is faſhioned: about him he
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:97741:44"/>
ſhall ſee an innumerable company of Holy Angels, and glorifyed Saints, his Brethren; not one of them envying his happineſs, but all congratulating him for it, and rejoycing in it. Beneath him, he ſhall ſee the Infernal Pit of Hell; wherein ſo many millions of loſt ſouls are to ſpend a miſerable Eternity in unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able torment; which muſt needs fill him with ineffable joy to think, how near once, he himſelf was falling into it; but was happily prevented by the arms of free Grace, ſeaſonably interpoſing and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>atching him. In a word, he ſhall have joy without ſorrow, health without languour, reſt without labour, and life without end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is an entire ſtate. There is not only all Ingredients of Happineſs in Heaven, but the Saint enjoyeth all together: here on Earth, the Chriſtian hath many pretious Promiſes, ſweet Refreſhings and Comforts; but he takes in the ſweetneſs of them ſucceſſively, not all in one draught. Indeed, the largeſt Heart, of the Holyeſt Saint on
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:97741:45"/>
Earth, is an houſe of too little receipt and roomth, to entertain ſo many Gueſts together. No, now the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an entertains himſelf, firſt in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of one, then of another Promiſe. God comes in a little at this, and more at the next Sermon he hears. He is as a leaky veſſel under a runing cock, filling, but never full: But in Heaven, the Saint is filled, and that all at once; as a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel thrown into the Sea, full as ſoon as it is in. This the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> expreſſion ſeems to import, <hi>that mortality might be ſwallowed up of life,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.4. in a word, the Chriſtian here is like ſome great man, that hath a vaſt eſtate, but he neither ſeeth all his Land, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives all his Rents together; but in Heaven, his whole felicity is preſent; not one imaginary point of time, wherein he can be more, or ſhall be leſs happy to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is a conſiſtent and fixed ſtate, free from all changes and viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, which in this life he is ſubject to: here, alas, the Chriſtian is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:97741:45"/>
well, and ſometimes ſick; now in Proſperity, then in Adverſity; Rich and Poor in the ſame day: <hi>In momento vertitur mare &amp; ubi luſerunt navigia ſorbentur.</hi> In a moment, a ſtorm ariſing, where the Ship even now danced, it is wrackt. He is like one that Travels in an <hi>April</hi> day, whoſe Cloak is wet with the Rain, and dryed again by the Sun, and then wet again: neither do theſe changes only befal the Saints outward ſtate, but his inward alſo, both in point of Grace and Comfort. Now his Heart is up and lively in the performance of a duty; anon ſo dead and down, as if he were not the ſame man. Now the Chriſtians Coat is on, ready to attend and follow his Maſter; anon it is off, and he on his bed of ſloth. So in point of Comfort; one while the Spouſe hath her Beloved in her arms, and is raviſhed with his company; another while, ſhe is ſetting up her, <hi>Si quis,</hi> and enquiring if any can tell her tydings of him; <hi>hora longa, brevis mora:</hi> The Chriſtian waits long for the Comforter, and when he

               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:97741:47"/>
comes, he doth but look in, and then withdraws again: ſo that the joy which he hath at preſent, is much interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the fear of loſing it; for, <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo fruitur ſolicito bono</hi>; how much there is of fear, ſo little is then of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in what we have. Indeed, what ever the Saints refreſhings are here, 'tis but like a Travellers entertainment in an Inn; the thoughts that he muſt to Horſe again in the morning, doth leſſen the pleaſure he takes in it. But in Heaven, the journey is at an end, the Saint is at home; his labour is gone, and his reſt is come; he is in a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that cannot be moved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It is an Eternal ſtate, this is more than the former; the property that crowns all the reſt. There are ſome in this life (and thoſe none of the beſt) who meet with no changes, and that for a long time;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.19.</note> who enjoy a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Summers day; their Sun of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity goes not in and out, but ſhines with a conſtant beam; no black cloud of any great Affliction, interpoſing, to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:97741:47"/>
hide their joy from them: but at laſt, death chops in upon them, and ſpoils all their mirth; in a moment they go down to the pit, and with them all their thoughts periſh. What joy remains to him that is in miſery, to remember the years of pleaſure he hath had? A paſt felicity, is a preſent miſery; and to remember the pleaſure we had, doubles the ſorrow we have. This made Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> interpret that place of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, with long life will I ſatisfie him of Heaven</hi>; becauſe he thought nothing was long that had an end. This, indeed, is the Emphaſis of Heavens joy; thoſe Bleſſed Souls ſhall never ſin, never weep more; they ſhall not only be with the Lord, but ever with the Lord. This is the accent which is ſet on the Elogies, given to Heaven, in Scripture. 'Tis an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and that an incorruptible one, that fadeth not away: It is a Crown of Glory, and that a weighty one; yea, an exceeding great and eternal weight of Glory. When once it is on the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:97741:48"/>
Saints head, it can never fall, or be ſnatched off; it is a Feaſt, but ſuch an one, that hath a ſitting down to it, but no riſing up from it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond way</hi> I propounded for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the Saints reward, was, to compare the Saints work and labour with the reward. For though the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward be great, yet if the labour bear any conſiderable proportion to it, ſo much of its greatneſs is taken away. But the Chriſtians labour here bears no proportion at all, with his reward here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; and therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>It is not worthy to be compared with the Glory that ſhall be revealed.</hi> His labour is finite, but his reward infinite; and there is no proportion between finite, and infinite. There is but little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, you will ſay, betwixt a drop of water, and the Sea; yet there is ſome, becauſe though vaſtly greater, yet not infinitely greater: but betwixt theſe finite, and infinite, there is none at all. The Chriſtians reward is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite; <hi>Firſt, Intenſive,</hi> God himſelf is
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:97741:48"/>
his reward, as well as his rewarder, who is infinite in all his Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. And what proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a poor nothing Creature, and his nothing Service, to the having this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely Glorious God his portion? So far are theſe from bearing any propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God, that compared with him, they are denyed to be, <hi>I am, and there is none beſides me,</hi> ſaith God, or to have any excellency; he is the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one, the only wiſe God. Mans wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is no wiſdom; his holineſs, no holineſs compared to God. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is infinite <hi>extenſivè,</hi> or in duration. Their reward is an everlaſting life; but their work and labour for the Lord, how ſhort? how ſoon is it diſpatched? If there be no proportion between Time, and Eternity; then none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Chriſtians labour, which is performed in ſo little a point of time, and the reward which endures for ever and ever. The Chriſtian is a few hours in the Field at his work, and then called into an everlaſting reſt in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:97741:49"/>
his Fathers houſe. He carries a light croſs, a little way on his back, which death at the furtheſt takes off; and then an Eternal Crown of Glory is ſet on his Head. It aggravated King <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimachus</hi> his ſorrow, that he had loſt ſo great a Kingdom, for ſo little a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as a draught of water. How will it raviſh the Saints Heart, to receive ſo great a reward, at the end of ſo ſhort a labour? <hi>Jonathan</hi> wondered that a little Honey, ſhould coſt him ſo dear as death. <hi>I did</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but taſte a little Honey, with the end of the Rod, that was in mine hand, and lo I muſt dye.</hi> How much more admiringly may the Saint ſay; 'tis but a little, and that ſorry ſervice that I have done for my God on Earth; and lo I muſt live, yea, live with God; yea, with God everlaſtingly in Glory. Well may the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>That Chriſt ſhall come to be admired in all them that believe,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.10. How can it but make them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, to ſee ſo infinite a Glory the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of ſo poor a labour?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:97741:49"/>Object. <hi>But why ſhould not the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians Holy labour and Faithful ſervice, bear the ſame proportion to his reward in Heaven, as the wicked mans ſin doth to his puniſhment in Hell? this deſerves that, why not that this? though the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mans ſin be as little a time in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, as the Saints Holy ſervice is in performing; yet there is an infinite evil in his ſin (that is,</hi> objective) <hi>becauſe committed againſt an infinite God. And why ſhould there not be the ſame reaſon for the Chriſtians labour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a vaſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe, the nature of Sin, and the nature of Good and Holy Actions. The evil of ſin, bears proportion to the object, or perſon offended by it; as the object is higher, and more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, ſo the offence is greater. The ſame offence done to a King, is far greater, than that which is done to a mean Subject. Every ſin therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing committed againſt an infinite God, comes to be an infinite evil; and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:97741:50"/>
an infinite puniſhment. But the valour and worth of a good and holy action, ariſeth not from the excellency of the object, but of the ſubject, whoſe act it is. This made Chriſt his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence meritorious, and ſatisfactory with God for us; becauſe his perſon, who performed it, was ſo excellent, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite worth and dignity. And for the ſame reaſon, the Chriſtians obedience can deſerve nothing, his perſon being ſo mean and low, and performed to God, who is ſo infinitely great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Chriſtians labour can deſerve no reward at Gods hands, as ſin doth puniſhment; becauſe the ſervice he doth is due debt; he owes it to his God, and even men do not uſe to reward thoſe who pay them a debt; nay, not thank them: So ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Doth the Maſter thank his Servant, becauſe he did that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him? I trow not,</hi> Luke 17.9. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Chriſtians work and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour falls ſhort of what is due; it is blended with ſin; his Silver is mixed
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:97741:50"/>
with droſs, and his Wine with water; yea, there is but <hi>parvum in magno,</hi> a little ſilver with an abundance of droſs. <hi>Our righteouſneſſes are as filthy rags,</hi> Pſal. 64.6. Surely that work deſerves not a good reward, which deſerves a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Lastly,</hi> That little which is found truly and ſpiritually good, is not the Chriſtians own; but his, by whoſe power it was done. The Chriſtian may ſay of his beſt performed duty, what he of his axe, <hi>Oh maſter it is bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed:</hi> The act, indeed, is the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians own, in Believing, Repenting, and the reſt; he uſeth his own facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but the power by which he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to do ſo, is Chriſts. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is ſo far from deſerving a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that he is indebted to God for his aſſiſtance; and the greater the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is, the greater is the debt he contracts. Inſtead therefore of expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thanks from God, for what he hath done, he owes thanks, and praiſe to God, who helped him to do it. Thus <hi>David,</hi> 1 Chron. 29.13. <hi>Now therefore,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:97741:51"/>
our God, we thank thee, and praiſe thy glorious name; but who am I? and what is my people, that we ſhould be able to offer ſo willingly after this ſort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own me have given thee:</hi> Yet this is the work which God ſo wonderfully rewards of his Free Grace; <hi>pugna &amp; ego adjuvabo, vince &amp; ego coronabo.</hi> Fight and I will help, overcome and I will Crown thee. God works all in us, and then rewards the work, as if all had been done by our ſelves; Oh Free Grace, never e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough admired Mercy!</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But if the reward be ſo glorious, what reaſon can then be given, why ſo few are found that will labour for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If you expect a good reaſon, there is none can be given: but if a true reaſon will ſerve, it is ſoon at hand. <hi>First,</hi> Becauſe Heaven is a reward that is unſeen to the Eye of Senſe, and Carnal men (who make the moſt in the world) have not ſuch an
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:97741:51"/>
eye, as the eye of Faith, to make it evident to them: they have, indeed, an eye of Senſe in their Head, but that like the Sun, doth <hi>revelare inferiora, ſed obſignare ſuperiora.</hi> It ſhews the good of ſenſual objects here below, but leaves the Glory of Heaven unſeen. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Heaven is a glorious reward, but 'tis to come, we muſt wait for it; and carnal mens deſires are impetuous, that will not let them ſtay ſo long for their conſolation. Now the world that offers preſent pleaſure, preſent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, preſent eaſe; and moſt men are like beggarly traders, who cannot ſell for time, but muſt have ready money, though they put off their Goods with loſs; thus do carnal men. <hi>Give me my Portion</hi> (ſaid the <hi>Prodigal)</hi> Never thinks what he ſhall do, when that is ſpent. <hi>Demas loved this preſent World,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 14.10. Heaven is a great way off, they will put that to the adventure; <hi>occidit modo imperat. Let him kill me,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Agrippina</hi> of her Son) <hi>only let him reign.</hi> This is the language of many mens
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:97741:52"/>
hearts, fall back, fall edge, damned, or not damned hereafter, ſo I may have my preſent luſt ſatisfyed <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners do not like the nature and quality of Heaven. Some expreſſions, indeed, there are, with which it is ſet forth in Scripture, that pleaſe them very well, were they true in the Letter; as when it is ſet out by a Marriage Feaſt, by Rivers of Pleaſures, by a Crown and Kingdom. A Feaſt the Glutton likes, were the chear ſuch in Heaven, as is on his own Table here on Earth; if the Wine of that Kingdom were ſuch as is drawn at the Tavern, the Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard would be for it. But a Feaſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Senſual fare, joy without jollity, Muſick without Fidling, a Crown and Kingdom without worldly Splendour or Pomp, are ſuch things as put them quite out of liking with it. So that they care for Heaven only, when they can have Earth no longer, and chuſe it as a place only more deſirable than Hell.</p>

               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Some among them, of a ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and falſe report, they bring upon the holy ways of God; as if it would not quit coſt to be Religious; and to take pains in its work, were labour loſt. This, I confeſs, is an high charge, and there is reaſon I ſhould make it good, before I proceed to the refuting of it; leſt while I accuſe others of ſlandering, my ſelf be thought the Slanderer; and to ſet up an enemy to ſhoot at, when there is none, except in mine own ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. But the proof is eaſie. The Devils Empire in the world, was founded firſt of a lye; and as he got it, ſo he labours to keep it; he found man at the firſt, happy in his willing ſubjection, and obedience to his God; his only way therefore to undo him, was to inveigle him out of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97741:53"/>
into his own; to effect this his Policy, was to bring him into a diſlike of his preſent ſtate; and to promiſe him, not only impunity, but ſtrange ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, accruing upon the change of his Maſter. Thus as Enemies throw down Caſtles, by blowing them up; ſo he by puffing man up with a conceit of being like God, brought him down from the height of his Felicity; and inſtead of making him like a God, made him like himſelf, who is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Devil. Speeding ſo well by this ſtratagem, he hath uſed it ever ſince, to keep ſinners from returning to their firſt rightful Lord and Maſter, as he had done, to entice man, at firſt from his ſervice; that is, by ſlandering God and Religion. He muſt be a hard Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, that reaps where he doth not ſow, or ſuffers not his Servants to reap what they do ſow. Either he exacts more than he gives ability to do, or he doth not reward the work they have done, and ſo makes them labour in vain. Both falſe ſlanders. The firſt
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:97741:53"/>
I muſt paſs over as foreign to my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. But the ſecond lies in my way; and God knows, though it be as untrue, as he is true, yet it finds too eaſie credence among Sinners, who are glad to have any pretence to excuſe them from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſervice of God, which their own corrupt hearts do ſo much diſlike. This, therefore, hath been the old Plea, which wicked men have made for their averſation to Religion, <hi>Job</hi> 22.17. <hi>Which ſaid unto God, depart from us, and what can the Almighty do for them?</hi> Oh what Sots doth ſin make men? their Plea had been more plauſible, if they had ſaid, what can the Unmighty do for them? but to call him Almighty, and then ask what he can do, ſhews they were ſunk beneath reaſon. Who, indeed, can exerciſe reaſon againſt God? you ſee here this prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Piety, is as Antient, as <hi>Jobs</hi> time, who is judged to have lived about, if not before <hi>Moſes</hi> his Age. Yet was it not then Novel, for <hi>Eliphas</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>Hast thou marked the old way
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:97741:54"/>
which wicked men have trodden?</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid right. <hi>Cain</hi> would kill <hi>Abel</hi> to the end of the world; and ſo had they, and will have vile and cheap thoughts of Religion. It held, I am ſure, in <hi>Malachi</hi> his time; <hi>Ye have ſaid it is vain to ſerve God,</hi> Chap. 3. ver. 14. And have we any reaſon to think, that the ſame prejudice againſt Religion, continues not amongſt many ungodly ones, in theſe laſt times? wherein the world is grown as older, ſo colder to Religion. Old Age, indeed, is not wont to cure, but rather increaſe diſeaſes that are hereditary: the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious prophaneneſs, and filthineſs, of our preſent Age, with the ſcorn that is caſt upon all ſerious endeavours, after Holineſs, is no good indication that it is ceaſed, but the contrary; that ſuch as theſe have a moſt vile and baſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Religion; how elſe were it poſſible they would dub themſelves, while wallowing in their brutiſh luſts, for the wiſe and happy men; and deſpiſe others, as doting Fools, that dare not
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:97741:54"/>
venture their Souls in their company, by running with them into the ſame exceſs and riot? If they did not firſt think Religion an inſignificant thing, Piety a needleſs ſcrupuloſity, and all the Chriſtians pains therein, in vain; and thoſe to be in the right, and go away with all the gains, who will have nothing to do with Religion, but live in an open defiance of it. Now, though what hath been ſaid already of the glorious reward, which will certainly crown the Chriſtians labour, be enough to wipe of this dirt from the face of Religion, and leave it on their own that throw it; yet I ſhall a little, and <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> ſpeak to the vindication of it in this point. And who, though but a ſtripling, would not venture to cope with ſuch <hi>Goliahs,</hi> or Gyants of the Earth; that defie the Living God, and his Hoſts of Saints? Is it not ſtrange that thoſe poor wretches ſhould not take notice in whoſe hand the Pencil is, by the illfavouredneſs of the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traicture that here is drawn of God and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:97741:55"/>
Religion? Who but the Devil himſelf, would preſent him, and his holy ways, in ſuch black lines and lineaments to their thoughts? and is it not more ſtrange, that any of mankind ſhould ſo far forget, or go againſt thoſe common notions of the Divine goodneſs, which naturally are impreſſed upon their minds, as to believe God to be ſuch an one, as the Devil, his ſworn Enemy, tells them he is? But moſt of all ſtrange it is, that thoſe who have read, or heard the Goſpel, where God, not only, more fully makes known the goodneſs and graciouſneſs of his Nature, but alſo opens the counſel of his Will and Mercy to poor ſinners, and brings life and immortality to light, as the ſure reward of thoſe, who at his gracious call, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt as their Lord and Saviour, ſhould after all this, ſing the ſame old note with ignorant <hi>Heathens; 'Tis in vain to ſerve God.</hi> And ſutable to ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of him, lead Irreligious and Flagitious Lives, having nothing but the word of a lying Devil to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:97741:55"/>
them from Eternal miſery. This is ſuch an infatuation, as the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſhew the like; but who ſo blind as he, whoſe eyes are put out with Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-light? into this righteous judgment upon them, for rebelling againſt light, we muſt reſolve this their folly. <hi>For judgment I am come into this world, that they which ſee not, might ſee, and that they which ſee might be made blind,</hi> John 9.39. But to reaſon a little with this ſort of men; can you think that the God of Truth hath made ſo many Promiſes to his people to deceive them with a falſe hope? will he be unrighteous to forget their labour of Love, after he hath made himſelf a Debtor, if not to them, yet to his own faithfulneſs, by making his Promiſe? Can he, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards even the wicked for any work, in which he uſeth them, let his own faithful ſervants loſe their pains? <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> had the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> given him for his ſervice againſt <hi>Tyrus, Ezek.</hi> 29.18.19. <hi>Cyrus</hi> had a great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire for his expedition againſt <hi>Babylon:</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:97741:56"/>
though theſe meant nothing leſs than the ſerving and glorifying of God, but aimed at the enlargement of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, and ſatisfying their own am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; yet becauſe they were inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to accompliſh his ſecret Decrees, in fauour of his People, he gave them a reward. And did he reward them for his peoples ſake, and will he let theſe his own people ſit down with loſs, who out of pure Conſcience and Love to him, do his work, and fight his Battels againſt Fleſh, World, and Devil? It cannot be, he doth indeed make them ſtay longer, than the other, for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; but they are ſure to ſpeed bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at laſt; they, like <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> are ſent away preſently with bread and bottle. Temporal rewards, they have their Conſolation here; but when their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſpent, then the Saint ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his reward, an Inheritance incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, and Eternal. <hi>Be patient</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>and eſtabliſh your hearts, for the coming of the Lord draws nigh.</hi> And when he cometh, their reward
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:97741:56"/>
comes with him. <hi>Again,</hi> Do you not croſs the experiences of all the Saints, do they not they all give God and his ſervice a good word? proclaiming him the beſt Maſter they ever ſerved.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.8.</note> 
               <hi>In keeping thy commands is great reward,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David)</hi> And again, <hi>Oh taſte and ſee how good the Lord is</hi>; once, I confeſs, in the Paroxiſm of a ſore Temptation, he ſpake like one of the fooliſh world; <hi>I have cleanſed my heart in vain, and waſhed my hands in innocency,</hi> Pſalm 73.13. But will ye believe what a man ſaith, when his head is hot and light in the fit of a Fever, rather than when he is in his true and right temper? No ſooner was this fit off, but he befools and be beaſts himſelf, and bleſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his approaching happineſs. <hi>Thou ſhalt guide me with thy counſel, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward receive me unto Glory,</hi> verſe 24. And from this hope takes faſter hold of God and his Holy ways; <hi>But it is good for me to draw near to God,</hi> ver. 28. And ſurely one affirmative teſtimony of a Saint, in vindication of God and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:97741:57"/>
Religion, is of more weight than a thouſand negative teſtimonies of the wicked world to the contrary, who ſpeak evil of what they underſtand not; condemn Religion before they have tryed it, and diſgrace that ſervice they were never in. Whereas the godly man hath ſerved both Maſters, and ſpeaks from his own experience, where moſt is to be got; profeſſing that he hath nothing to ſhew of his gettings in the ſervice of ſin, but <hi>ſhame.</hi> But in the Lords ſervice,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.21.</note> preſent <hi>fruit unto Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and a hope of Eternal life after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. <hi>In a word,</hi> needs there any more to make this appear a falſe ſlander, than to obſerve, how theſe very wretches upon a ſick-bed, when they apprehend themſelves on the marches of death, do Court Religion; which in their jollity they Cart and Scourge with their reviling Tongues? Oh how glad would they then be to creep into a Saints cloaths, and go by his name; how deſirous to dye the Righteous mans death, and to have an end like his?
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:97741:57"/>
Oh how afraid to look into another world, or to think of going hence as they are? Doth not all this ſpeak, that they themſelves ſecretly think there is more reality in Religion, and the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conſequences of it, than they will in their Proſperity confeſs? The truth is, God hath their Conſcience on his ſide, but their Luſts have their Hearts; and theſe are they which gag their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that it may not ſpeak what it would: but at laſt, Conſcience is even with them, and revengeth the violence offered to it, upon them. And for ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its mouth a while, opens it the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at laſt; both in accuſing them for this their paſt wickedneſs, and terrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with the fearful expectation of the Diſmal Tempeſt of Fire and Brimſtone, ready now to pour down upon them. Thus as the hardeſt Froſts, when they break, leave the deepeſt ſlugs behind them: ſo doth the greateſt Dedolency and inſenſibility, in an Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious life, leave ſinners (when Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience recovers its ſenſe and feeling)
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:97741:58"/>
ſticking faſt in the deepeſt horror and deſperation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This convicts the carnal world of groſs folly, in refuſing the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, where the reward of their labour is ſo ſure and incomprehenſibly great; and for miſplacing their pains and labour for that which is neither ſure to be obtained, nor much worth the having, if it be gotten; and ſo in both reſpects labour in vain. <hi>Firſt,</hi> the ſinner labours for what he is not ſure to obtain. The world hath not to this day been able to give a certain rule whereby the covetous Worldling, can be ſure after all his toyl and drudgery, that he ſhall be rich; nor the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that he ſhall get up the hill of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and not catch a fall in climbing it: the world is too like a Lottery, where men know not whether they ſhall draw a Prize or Blank. Though all come with heads full of hopes and projects into the world, yet moſt go out with hearts full of ſhame and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for their diſappointments. But in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:97741:58"/>
Religion, there is ſuch a certain rule laid down in the good Word of God, that whoever walks by it, <hi>Peace is upon him; ſay ye to the Righteous it ſhall be well with him. Mark the Perfect man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.37.</note> 
               <hi>and behold the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright, for the end of that man is Peace,</hi> Pſalm 37.37. They that wait on the Lord ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, becauſe not diſappointed of their hope; but ſome carnal men will tell you, whatever the world is to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet they can ſay their labour is not in vain. This worldling, who hath proſpered in his way, can ſhew you his filled bags, and tell you how many hundreds a year he puts up as clear gain into his Purſe. The Voluptuous perſon will tell you ſtories of the many merry Meetings he hath been at, Months and Years of Pleaſure he hath enjoyed; ſaying with the carnal <hi>Jews, Theſe are the rewards our Lovers have given us,</hi> Hoſea 2.12. How then ſay you, that we labour upon ſuch uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties? In the ſecond place therefore, the prize that ſinners get by all their
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:97741:59"/>
Labour, it is not ſo much worth, as to ſave them from loſing their Labour. For <hi>Firſt,</hi> What they have got will ere long leave them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It will damn them. <hi>Firſt,</hi> It will leave them. It is not in the power of mans wit to deviſe a way, how the Ambitious man ſhould keep his honour long, except his preferment could change his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and make him immortal; he is, alas, ſtill of the ſame clay with other men, as he was before. The Rainbow is a common watry Cloud, no more durable, than the reſt, though painted for a time with gayer colours. <hi>That which hath been, is named already, and it is known that it is man,</hi> Eccleſ. 6.10. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a lump of red earth, that muſt return ere long to his firſt duſt. As impoſſible it is for the Covetous man to make his eſtate ſure to him; his Riches will <hi>make wings to themſelves,</hi> though he doth not as the Prodigal,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.5. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.3.</note> make wings for them; fly away they will, and <hi>that toward Heaven</hi> alſo, to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:97741:59"/>
accuſe him, and be a witneſs againſt him at the laſt day. If he ſhould not ſee them flown from him while he lives, yet to be ſure when Death's Gun goes off, theſe, and all the ſinners joys, will flye away at once. And how near a ſtep it is to Death, the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens can tell you, by their Hyrogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick of an <hi>open eye</hi> for life, and <hi>an eye ſhut</hi> for death; intimating, that death may come, <hi>ictu oculi</hi>; mans life may be cloſed up, as ſoon as an eye can be ſhut: And is it not folly and madneſs to beſtow all a mans Labour, to raiſe the hopes of his Felicity on ſuch looſe ground, where his building may fall as ſoon as it is up? this made <hi>Solomon hate all his labour under the Sun,</hi> Eccleſ. 2.17. Becauſe when he had done all, he muſt leave all. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> What Carnal men labour for, will deceive them. Satan and the World are both very free of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to their Vaſſals and Servants; <hi>All theſe things, will I give thee,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>if thou wilt fall down and worſhip
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:97741:60"/>
me.</hi> But alas, when the promiſed Feaſt comes to be ſerved in; it proves, as we ſay, nothing between two diſhes: <hi>They ſpend their Money for that which is not Bread; they labour for that which doth not profit,</hi> yea, 'tis worſe than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. For Bread they have Stones, for Fiſh Scorpions given them; inſtead of content, they have vexation, and a ſting in their Conſcience. Hence the wicked are ſaid, <hi>to work a deceitful work,</hi> Prov. 11.18. Deceitful, becauſe it deceiveth the worker; would not he be deceived, who labours hard all day, in hope of a good reward at night from his Maſter, but is then paid with nothing but a good Cudgel upon his bones? This is the reward which Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have even in this life; many a blow and ſtripe laid upon him by his Conſcience, which others do not ſee, but he feels; he expects a Paradiſe, but finds a Purgatory, and not only ſo, but ſometimes God teſtifying openly againſt him in his Judgments. No doubt <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hazi</hi> pleaſed himſelf with his Plot,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:97741:60"/>
whereby he might get in one day, more than he was like to do in many years ſervice of his Maſter. Oh how brave ſhould he be, when his new Cloaths were on his back? but, alas, he did not think of that other Garment of Leproſie, which God would beſtow on him, a Garment not like others, to cover his ſhame, but to diſcover and proclaim his ſin; a Garment that ſhould laſt him to wear, and his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, from Generation to Generation. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That which the Sinner labours for, will not only leave and deceive, but alſo everlaſtingly damn him; they do not only labour for vanity, but <hi>they labour in the fire for it,</hi> Habak. 2. Hell fire, I am ſure, will be the end of their labour; what the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith of one ſort of Sinners, <hi>They that will be rich, fall into temptation, and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh and hurtful luſts, which drown men in deſtruction and perdition,</hi> is as true of the reſt. He that will have Pleaſures, or he that will have Honour; an Heart ſet vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:97741:61"/>
on any thing here below, that makes it his Treaſure to enjoy, and therefore his chief Labour to obtain; this man muſt needs fall into temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a ſnare, and many fooliſh and hurtful luſts, which (without Gods merciful hand, ſnatching him out of their Clutches) are ſure to drown them in Eternal Perdition. Was <hi>Shimei</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, who by going out of his Precincts to recover his run-away Servants, loſt his own life? How much more folly and madneſs is it, by hunting after the run-away Vanities of the Creature, that are but thy ſervants to loſe the life of thy Soul? <hi>Cur ea quae ad uſum diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turna eſſe non poſſunt, ad ſupplicium diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turna depoſces?</hi> Why wilt thou, oh man, make that which is but temporary in the uſe, eternal is thy puniſhment? Who would crave the ſweeteſt morſel in the world, which after the ſhort Pleaſure in ſwallowing of it down, would cauſe intollerable gripes in his Bowels for but a month? and wilt thou devour that, which thou muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:97741:61"/>
in Hell with Torments, as end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as eaſleſs?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Of Exhortation, to all that are at preſent in the ſervice of Sin, to be perſwaded to change your Maſter. Oh come now into the Lords ſervice, that at death you may enter into your Lords joy; enter into his Vineyard now, that you may have your penny at night amongſt his Faithful Labourers; labour for God in this world, that you may reſt with God from your labours in the other. It is ſaid of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that when he had brought his Army ſo near <hi>Rome,</hi> that they might ſee it before them, he bad his Souldiers look upon it wiſhly, ſaying, <hi>What think you? is not yonder brave City worth Fighting for?</hi> I have been ſpeaking of another gueſs place. Let me deſire you to look once again up to the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the City and Chamber of the great King, where is laid up this goodly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſpoken to; is it not worth the labouring for, and going to, though every ſtep of the way were to be trod
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:97741:62"/>
on points of Swords? Is it not a bleſſed thing to behold God face to face? to be ever with the Lord? to bathe thy ſelf in thoſe Pleaſures that are at his right hand? to drink the wine of the Kingdom, in the Kingdom of Heaven it ſelf? Wilt thou loſe it, as <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> did his worldly Kingdom, by ſtaying to drink a draught of puddle water? the muddy pleaſures of Sin for a ſeaſon? long thou canſt not ſtay here. Doth it not behove thee to make ſure of an houſe above to receive thee, when thou art turned out of thy Earthly Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle here? and if it doth, muſt thou not become his Servant, do his work, or never look for his reward? And if thou wilt do it, when mean'ſt thou to ſet about it, if not now? Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is won or loſt here, now and ever, now or never. When death takes thee off the ſtage, think not to have leave to return, that thou mayſt act thy part better. Times loſs is the moſt irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable; thou mayſt loſe thy Ring, and find it again; thy Houſe may be
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:97741:62"/>
burnt, and built again; but if time be loſt, that never can be recovered. Death is a change, that puts into an unchangeable ſtate, the Saint into a ſtate of Bliſs, the Sinner into a ſtate of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. Heaven the reward of Gods Labourers, and Hell the wages of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Workers and Loiterers. Oh think, and think again, before it be too late, what rapping there will be at Heaven Gate, what calling, and crying to be let in; yea, even by thoſe, who now, when it ſtands open may, and will not; and therefore then ſhall have no other anſwer, than that of our Saviour, <hi>I never knew you, depart from me, ye that work iniquity</hi>; let him pay you, that ſet you on work. Sinners, you think that at preſent you have the odds and advantage of the Saints; they are Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerating themſelves with Faſting, while you are pampering your ſelves with Feaſting; they are Mourning for their Sins, while you are Pleaſurably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting yours; they are Afflicted, and you are at Eaſe; you get the World,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:97741:63"/>
and they loſe it. But then the Tables will be turned, they will recover all their loſſes here, and thou loſe all thy gain; their ſorrows will take leave of them, never to trouble them more; but thy joys will be at end, and thy ſorrows come in the room of them. In a word, they ſhall be comforted, and you tormented. 2. To the Saints. Walk in the view of this your reward, and make an holy improvement of it in your lives. That which is the end of our Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> Salvation, ſhould be propounded as the end of all our actings, and have an influence into our whole courſe. <hi>Finis principium eſt om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium operationum</hi>; it ſhould have the nature of a Direction what to do, and of a Motive to inforce, and invigorate us in all we do. As the Bird is guided by its Train, and the Ship by its Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſo the Chriſtian ſhould by his end. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Therefore let this Glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thou ſeeſt before thee, keep thee from accepting of the rewards of ſin; let them love the reward of iniquity,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:97741:63"/>
that look not for a reward of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. <hi>Abraham</hi> would not have it ſaid, <hi>the King of</hi> Sodom <hi>made him rich, who had God for his exceeding great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> Moſes, <hi>who had reſpect unto the recompence of the reward, deſpiſed the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon.</hi> It diſhonoreth the <hi>Prince,</hi> when his <hi>Courtier</hi> accepts a Penſion from a ſtrange, much more from an enemy Prince. When we yield to any ſin, we do what Satan tempted Chriſt unto, even worſhip and pay an homage to him. I know no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to repel the Enemy, more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, nor more honourable, than this; I will not diſgrace my Maſters ſervice, the hopes I have from him, to borrow a reward from his Enemy. Some Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are wont to ſight in their richeſt Cloaths and Jewels, to make them more valiant, by conſidering how great their loſs would be, by falling into their Enemies hands. Certainly, Satan would not ſo eaſily foil thee (Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an) if thou didſt wear the rich Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets of the Promiſes, and by Faith put
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:97741:64"/>
on that robe of Glory, with which thou ſhalt ere long be clothed. How would a glorified Saint ſcorn a motion to ſin, <hi>Viſio beatifica impotentes facit Angelos &amp; ſanctos ad peccandum.</hi> What, they ſin? the Sun might ſooner be pull'd out of its Orb, than they out of their Obedience. What, they leave the Fatneſs and Sweetneſs they are ſatiated with, for any thing that is to be got by a baſe ſinner? Such a thought never did, nor can enter into their Holy Heart. And we ſhould be more like them, in our deteſtation of all ſin, had we more raiſed apprehenſions of the greatneſs of the Heavenly reward, and ſtronger hopes for our coming to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let it make thee ſtedfaſt, and unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord. This is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement which our Apoſtle makes in this place, of this very Point; there is a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in Religion, much preſſed by the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> upon Believers, <hi>to walk as becomes the Goſpel, as becomes Saints, to walk worthy of God, worthy of our
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:97741:64"/>
Holy Vocation.</hi> Now this becomingneſs lies much in the ſutableneſs of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent actings, to the heighth of our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hopes. When we endeavour that the properties of our actions, may cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond, and bear a reſemblance to the reward expected by us. As the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on the Wax, anſwereth to the Sculpture of the Seal; or as the Port and Garb of a great Heir, is to the vaſt Inheritance he ſhall have. Now the Text, (for I go no further) preſents us with Two Properties of the Saints re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; Certainty, and Immenſity. And accordingly preſſes this double Duty, Stedfaſtneſs, or unmoveableneſs, and abounding always in the work of the Lord, as bearing a reſemblance unto it. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Therefore labour to be ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in thy profeſſion of the Faith; <hi>hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſt</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Word,</hi> Titus 1.9. How unſutable to a Faithful Word, is a Faithleſs Heart? A wavering weak Faith, to a ſure Word? 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. A Sceptical judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to a Doctrine that is indubitable,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:97741:65"/>
and without controverſie, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. How unbecoming is it to be off and on, hot and cold, unſtable and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in an holy courſe, when thou lookeſt for a Kingdom that cannot be ſhaken? <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let it make thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in the work of the Lord. How unſutable is it to pinch God in thy ſervice, who is ſo magnificent in his reward? How unbecoming, to think any meaſure enough in thy duty, when the reward promiſed, is without all meaſure? Nay, do not only abound, but be always abounding in the Lords work, who will make thee always hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. Alas, what is our always in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding here; to the always of his rewarding hereafter? the always of our ſervice extendeth but to the end of a ſhort life; but the always of the reward to an endleſs Eternity. Were there no reward at all hoped for, yet we ought; yea, the Saint would (for his new Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture inclines him thereunto) ſerve his God. We ſee even our Children, do love and obey us their Parents, though
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:97741:65"/>
ſome of us have no Portion or Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to leave them? But it ſuperadds a further Argument to a Rich mans Child, to make him more abundantly dutiful and diligent, to conſider what a great eſtate his Father hath; of all which he will make him Heir, though he might not (if he pleaſed) have ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led any thing on him at all. Thus when a Saint conſiders, that God, who might have made a Law, binding him to Obedience, without making a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to reward the ſame. It muſt needs much affect his heart, to ſee God in his condeſcending Grace, and immenſe Bounty, thus to ſweeten, and facilitate his Obedience, with a promiſe of no leſs reward, than of the Heavenly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. Think, oh Chriſtian, how little the greateſt ſervice thou canſt now do thy God, will in a dying hour appear to thine own thoughts. I have obſerved, that the beſt of Saints, whoſe eminency in Grace, and ſerviceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their Generations, others ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, have yet themſelves, upon a
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:97741:66"/>
ſick and dying bed, complained of their barrenneſs and unprofitableneſs. Not bragged of their zeal, but bewailed their coldneſs; not applauded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for what they had done, but mournfully confeſſed, what they had left undone; the ſenſe of their defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, quite hiding from their eyes the ſight of their eminent diligence. As that famous Light in our <hi>Britiſh Church,</hi> and laborious Servant of Chriſt, <hi>Biſhop <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> on his dying bed, thus Prayed, <hi>Oh God forgive my ſins of Omiſſion:</hi> Who yet was admired of all that knew him, for his laborious diligence in the Pulpit, and out of it alſo. And one reaſon, I humbly conceive, why the beſt of Saints, at ſuch an hour, are more than ever ſenſible of their deficiencies, is, becauſe they then ſtanding neareſt to Eternity, have higher and wider apprehenſions of the Majeſty of God, and the immenſe Glory of Heaven; which apprehenſions muſt needs cauſe them to ſee the vility and nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their own ſanctity, and all their
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:97741:66"/>
ſervices; and conſequently, fill them with an holy bluſhing and ſhame, that they have done ſo little for God, who hath laid up ſo much for them; that they have no more glorified him on Earth, who hope, ſo ſoon to be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with him in Heaven. And if the higheſt meaſures of the moſt fruitful Saints, which have done God more ſervice, than an hundred ſuch as thy ſelf, ſhrink into nothing, in their own eye at ſuch a time, and leave them full of ſhame and ſorrow for their unſutable actings, to their high and glorious hopes; how much more will it afflict thee with unſpeakable grief and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in the like hour (if thou haſt a dram of Sincerity in thine Heart) to remember thy more palpable negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and barrenneſs. Oh what then wilt thou ſay of thy paſt life, which is ſo thin ſown with Holy Actions? now thou thinkeſt thy ſelf Religious enough, with thy infrequent Devotions; if thou canſt get to the Church once in a week, and into thy Cloſet, for a few moments,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:97741:67"/>
once in a day, it is well: But when thou comeſt to dye, thou wilt then complain, how thou haſt ſtarved thy Soul, and robbed thy God of much time, which might, and ought to have been imployed in Communion with him, and working out thy own Salvation. Now a few Pence out of thy great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, paſſeth for Charity; but when death comes to ſweep all away at once, then thou wilt complain thou haſt been a niggard of thy Purſe, and didſt not honour God with thy Subſtance. Now though thou ſpeakeſt, but once or twice in a Moon of God, and Heaven in thy Family; and very ſeldom doſt Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe thy Children, and that but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, without any affection, or with little deſire to affect them, with the concernment of thoſe Truths, thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructeſt them in, yet thou pleaſeſt thy ſelf, in having done thy duty to them ſo well. But when death's cold ſweat ſhall warn you of your approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſſolution, then thou wilt bewail, that Religion was ſo ſeldom the ſubject
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:97741:67"/>
of thy diſcourſe, in your Family, that you did not more conſtantly inſtruct your Children and Servants; and when you did, that you did not more paſſionately endeavour to move their affections, and draw their hearts to the love and liking of Religion in its Truths, and the practice of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Improve the hope thou haſt for this reward, to make thee live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove this preſent world. Truly, thou mayſt well be content with a little here, who lookeſt for ſo much here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. If the Labourer hath but meat and drink at his work, he asketh no more, but ſtays willingly for the reſt till night, when he is to receive his wages. If thou haſt Food and Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here, and Heaven at the end, doth not God deal well with thee? Oh, 'tis for want of Faith in the Promiſe, and activity in our Hope, to exerciſe it ſelf on this Bleſſed Object, that we are ſo having and craving after the things of this world, and ſo diſſatisfied with our portion here. We read of <hi>Solomon,</hi>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:97741:68"/>
that he made <hi>Silver to be in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>as ſtones, &amp; Cedars as the Sycomore trees,</hi> 1 Kings 10.27. The Chriſtian might do more, had he a lively Faith and Hope; he might make all this worlds Glory, Pleaſures, and Treaſures, to be but as dirt and dung in his valuation, from what he expects to be preferred to, within a while in Heaven. And he is the happier man, that can live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the world, than he that ſwims in all its abundance. It is for want of better Metal, that Leather and Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per are ſtamped for Coin; and for want of Faith, or exerciſing it on the Promiſe, that we ſet too high a price of the things of this world. This would, and nothing elſe can take off our Hearts from preſent things. Our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are too great a ſtream to be dryed up; but turned, they may be, into another Chanel; and truly, the world is too narrow a Chanel to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them: But here is roomth enough, and more than enough for them all; here is a place of broad-water, no fear
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:97741:68"/>
of wanting Sea-room. If we would launch out into the Meditation of this bleſſed place, oh how ſhould we find our Hearts inflamed with longing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be there, and no more envy the Carnal world, for what we leave them here to enjoy, than you would the Swine his ſwill, if you were going to Feaſt at a Princes Table; which minds me of the next particular.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Improve this Glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to reconcile death to thy thoughts, and make thee rather deſire, than fear to be diſſolved. Many were the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, which the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Heathens</hi> muſtered up, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the fear of this King of Terrors; but the wiſeſt of them were baffled in all their attempts therein. As it is ſaid of <hi>Cicero,</hi> a little before his death, that he confeſſed the remedies, which he had prepared againſt this Enemy, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he knew not how, but too weak and feeble for that purpoſe. And one was bold to tell <hi>Plato,</hi> when he ſpake much of the contempt of death, <hi>Fortius
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:97741:69"/>
loqueris, quàm vivis</hi>; that he ſpoke higher than he lived; and no wonder, if we conſider, in how dark a light they ſaw the exiſtence of a future ſtate; and much more, at what a loſs they were for finding the right way which leads to the happineſs of it. Neither do I wonder, that any wicked man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel, ſhould be terrified at an approaching death, and go down to the grave, as, they ſay, Bears go down an Hill, backward; afraid to ſee, or think of that ſtate they are going into. For the more any knows of Heaven, without a well grounded hope of arriving there, the greater muſt his dread needs be. <hi>He that increaſeth knowledge</hi> here, will be ſure <hi>to increaſe his ſorrow</hi>; but why any of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, that have a hope of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſhould not in ſome meaſure over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the prevalency, at leaſt of this fear of death, is ſtrange; and, indeed, caſts a reproach upon Chriſtianity. The <hi>Turks</hi> (I have heard) ſome of them ſhould ſay; they did not think Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:97741:69"/>
believed there was an Heaven, becauſe they ſaw them ſo loth to go to it. Labour Chriſtian, to wipe of this reproach, which theſe Infidels caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Religion. <hi>First,</hi> Look thou buildeſt thy hope of Heaven, deep, and ſtrong, upon a good ground; which is Regenerating Grace, (for a dead Soul, cannot have a lively Hope) Then labour to hold faſt the rejoycing of thy Hope unto the end, to which it would much conduce, to preſerve a right notion of death in thy thoughts. What elſe (Chriſtian) is death to thee, but what <hi>Jordan</hi> was to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>? a paſſage from an howling Wilderneſs, of a ſinful miſerable World, where thou haſt been pinched with Wants, and ſtung with fiery Temptations, to a Land of Promiſe, where is ſafety to ſecurity, and fullneſs to Felicity: where thou wilt find the abſence of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but ſin and ſorrow. Look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, as the uncovering of the Ark of thy body, wherein thou haſt been toſſed and tumbled ſorely upon the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:97741:70"/>
waves of a reſtleſs life, to ſet thee on ſhore on Heavens firm and peaceable Land. Is the betrothed Spouſe afraid of her Marriage day? or a Prince loth to croſs a narrow Sea, to take poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a wide Kingdom, and a rich Crown, that wait only for his coming? No (Chriſtian) fear not thou death, but rather let thy heart revive with old <hi>Jacobs,</hi> at the ſight of this Wagon or Chariot, which is ſent to bring thee over to thy Heavenly Fathers houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Let it moderate your ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, for the death of your Pious Friends, and uſeful Inſtruments in their Generations. Indeed, the loſs of ſuch is great, to thoſe that are left behind; and therefore God allows us to mourn, when ſuch breaches are made upon us; but withal, he ſets bounds to our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that <hi>we ſorrow not even as others, which have no hope,</hi> nor mourn ſo as to refuſe to be comforted; to take our own loſs ſo to heart, as not to rejoyce in their gain: Is this thy kindneſs to thy Friends? wouldſt thou have them
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:97741:70"/>
labour, and never reſt? work, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver receive their reward? They could not have had theſe here, but they have them where they are gone. Oh be not unkind to them, by being over-kind to your ſelves. <hi>If ye loved me, ye would rejoice,</hi> (ſaith our Saviour to his Diſciples) <hi>becauſe I ſaid I go to the Father,</hi> Joh. 16.28. As if he had ſaid to them, you are indeed (my Diſciples) too ſelviſh. You think what you ſhall loſe if I depart hence, but you do not conſider, what I ſhould loſe, by my ſtaying here: You ſee the poor condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I live in here on Earth, and know the Royalty and Glory I am going to be poſſeſſed of in Heaven; and are you unwilling I ſhould be advanced to my Throne there; and that after I ſhall have finiſhed the work of your Redemption here? Truly you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and ſhew but little love, in this, to me, your dear Lord and Saviour. Nor do we expreſs much love to our deceaſed Friends, of whoſe happy change we have no reaſon to doubt,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:97741:71"/>
if their incomparable advantage doth not make us more rejoyce for them, than our loſs, make us mourn for our ſelves. If we be, as they were, (ſincere and faithful Chriſtians) our loſs is but ſhort; ere long we ſhall recover it, by being taken up to them; they are not loſt, but gone a little before, whither the reſt of their Brethren, ere long, ſhall be called. And while we are left here behind, we have a God to live upon, who cannot dye, who will not leave us, and whoſe preſence is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to compenſate, I trow, the abſence, not of one, but all our Friends. Would <hi>Elkanah</hi> be thought better to his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Wife, than ten Sons? May not God then look his Children, when bereaved of any Creature Comforts, ſhould count the having him better, yea, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely better than them all. Let therefore every Saint, in this, and all other bereavements, ſolace himſelf with this of <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm 18.46. <hi>The Lord liveth, and bleſſed be my rock, and let the God of my Salvation be exalted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:97741:71"/>It is expected, I know, that I ſhould now ſpeak ſomething of that Noble (and without offence, I hope, I may ſay) Elect Lady; the Solemnization of whoſe Funeral, occaſioned this our ſorrowful meeting; which ſhould I not do, without doubt, I ſhould ſend you all away, very much diſſatisfyed. But far be it from me, that I ſhould by my ſilence, put her light (now ſhe is dead) under a Buſhel, which ſhined, before all your eyes, ſo radiently, while ſhe was alive, even as a great Candle,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mar.</hi> 11.32.</note> on an high Candleſtick. It was ſaid of <hi>John Baptist, all men counted</hi> John, <hi>that he was a Prophet indeed.</hi> And I am perſwaded, that all who knew her, eſteemed the <hi>Lady Vere</hi> a <hi>Chriſtian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</hi> Truly, if we may not think ſo of her, we ſhall be at a great loſs to find ſuch Characters, by which we may judge any at all to be ſo. I ſhall begin to ſpeak of her, where ſhe her ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be, her Birth, I mean, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage, from which ſhe had her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction. And this was High and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:97741:72"/>
on both ſides. For by her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſide, ſhe ſprang from the chief of the <hi>Throg-mortons</hi> Family; and by the Fathers ſide, was extracted of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Family of the <hi>Tracies,</hi> at <hi>Toding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> in <hi>Glouceſter-ſhire.</hi> She was the youngeſt of Fifteen Children; born on the <hi>Eighteenth day of May, Anno</hi> 1581. being the 23. <hi>of Queen Elizabeth.</hi> Her Mother dyed three days after ſhe was Born; and her Father, when ſhe was but eight years old. Thus ſoon was ſhe an Orphan; but, indeed, they only are Orphans, who have no Father in Heaven. <hi>When her Father and her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thus forſook her, the Lord took her up.</hi> The many Experiences ſhe had all along her life, of Gods moſt tender care over her, occaſioned her to chuſe this for her <hi>Motto</hi> (which is found written by her, in the front of moſt of her Books in her Cloſet) <hi>God will Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide.</hi> She took much delight in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one of her Anceſtors, as one of the greateſt Honours to her Family. <hi>William Tracy</hi> of <hi>Toddington,</hi> Eſquire,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:97741:72"/>
mentioned by Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> in his Marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rology, who in the Reign of <hi>King Henry the Eighth,</hi> for the ſound Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his Faith, made by him in his laſt Will and Teſtament, was after his Deceaſe, condemned to have his body taken out of the ground and burnt; which Sentence, accordingly was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. She was twice Married; to Mr. <hi>William Hobby,</hi> her firſt Husband, at Nineteen Years of Age, by whom ſhe had two Sons, which were Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly Educated by her; the happy fruit of this her care, ſhe reaped at their Pious Deaths (for they both went young to Heaven) the Younger dyed in the Fourteenth Year of his Age; the Elder in his Three and Twentieth, much admired for his Parts, and loved for his Piety. Her ſecond Husband was, Sir <hi>Horace Vere,</hi> afterward <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Tilbury</hi>; ſo Noble and Excellent a Perſon, that I muſt not name him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome Honourable Reflection; one whoſe Coat Armour made more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned, than his Coat of Arms; and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:97741:73"/>
his Perſonal Atchievements in the field, ennobled more, than the High Blood he borrowed from his Anceſtors. But his Piety gave him the higheſt Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of all; by the other he got a <hi>great Name, like unto the great Men, that are in the Earth</hi>;<note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.19.</note> but by this he obtained <hi>a good Name.</hi> And even <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus,</hi> the <hi>Roman Historian,</hi> prefers a praiſe from Goodneſs, before that which is obtained by Greatneſs. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpeaking of a Noble <hi>Roman,</hi> ſaith, he was, <hi>inter claros potiùs quàm inter bonos cenſendus.</hi> This <hi>Noble Lord</hi> was one, who could wreſtle with God, as well as fight with Men; and may be thought to have got his Victories upon his knees in his Cloſet, before he drew his Sword in the Field. And when he had overcome his Enemies, he could overcome himſelf alſo; being one of the humbleſt Souls, in whom ſo much true worth lodged, that I have heard of. His good Lady would ſay, ſhe honoured him for his Valour, but moſt, for the Grace of God which ſhined in
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:97741:73"/>
him. Thus ſhe did, <hi>coruſcare radiis Mariti,</hi> ſhined by the Rays of her Husbands Excellencies; but not only with theſe, for ſhe had radient Beams of her own, by which ſhe caſt like Honour upon him, as ſhe received from him. So happily was this Noble Couple ſuited, us in the high Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of both their Births, ſo alſo in the reſt of their accompliſhments, that they mutually illuſtrated each the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Honour. But paſſing by all her ſecular Prerogatives, we ſhall now preſent her to you, in ſome of her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Excellencies. Theſe, indeed, give the intrinſick value to a perſon. He that would take the true height of of a man, muſt not meaſure him with the vantage-ground he ſtands on. I may ſay of this Gracious Lady, what <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſaid of another Noble Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in his time; She was <hi>a Faithful Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and feared God above many.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nehem.</hi> 7.2.</note> Some are ſo prodigiouſly wicked, that they ſeem to have wedded the Vices of many others. But this good Lady may
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:97741:74"/>
be ſaid to have collected the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of many other Chriſtians. In her you might have ſeen theſe various Graces, which grow to an eminency, but ſeverally in others, met altogether in one knot; I ſhall ſpeak of a few.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, The fear of the Great God,</hi> was very great in her; wonderful tender ſhe was of offending him. She hath been often heard to ſay, and that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly; Oh, I would not ſin againſt my God. She profeſſed, that ſhe dreaded Hell moſt, as a place where God was Blaſphemed. Oh pretious Saint, to dread Hells ſin, more than Hells fire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Her Zeal to the Worſhip of God,</hi> was eminent. <hi>Firſt,</hi> To the Publick, this was evidenced many ways. <hi>First,</hi> By her Zeal, to get able and faithful Miniſters for thoſe Livings ſhe had in her diſpoſe; and by improving her utmoſt intereſt, to procure the like for this Pariſh, where ſhe reſided, in its ſeveral vacancies. And herein the <hi>Noble Patron,</hi> did moſt kindly gratifie her with the choice, deeply obliging,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:97741:74"/>
not only her <hi>Honour,</hi> but the whole <hi>Town</hi> thereby; ſo that you in this place, have lived in a <hi>Goſhen</hi> of Goſpel light for a long ſeaſon; and are able alſo to tell, how <hi>comfortably ſhe ſpake to thoſe that taught the good Word of the Lord amongſt you.</hi> What countenance, and real encouragement ſhe gave them in the Lords Work, without ſparing her purſe to do it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> By her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant attendance on the Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſo long as the Lord vouchſafed her any health: yea, ſhe did not only attend on it her ſelf, but was careful that her Family ſhould do the ſame with her. They that would not ſerve God with her, were no Servants for her. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> She was no leſs devout in, than conſtant at the Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. She durſt not trifle with Holy things, which made one (in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect) ſay of her, <hi>That this Lady, by her Solemn and Reverent Deportment in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip, would make one believe that there is a God indeed.</hi> As for the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> which
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:97741:75"/>
is ſo diſmally neglected by many; her deſires were moſt Ardent to partake of it frequently, ſaying, (as the Miniſter of the place informed me) that ſhe durſt not neglect, no, not any one op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, that was offered for the enjoying this Sacred Ordinance. And, oh, how intent was ſhe in Preparation for it? the whole preceding week was taken up by her for that work; in which, ſhe would always have a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Faſt with her Family, or a ſecret one in her Cloſet. Was not this one that meant to go to Heaven in good earneſt? <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Private Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God. Let us follow her from the <hi>Church,</hi> to her own Houſe, and we ſhall find, that ſhe brought her Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Devotion home with her, and did not leave them in her Pue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind her, till ſhe returned to it again the next Sabbath. Some can comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment God Almighty, before their Neighbours, on the Sabbath, but care not to acquaint with God at home all the week after. But if ever any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:97741:75"/>
dwelling, might be called a <hi>Chappel</hi> or little <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> her houſe was ſuch. There you might find her, and her Family, twice every day, upon their knees, ſolemnly Worſhipping the Great God; there you might ſee them, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſitting, at his feet, to hear his moſt Holy Word read unto them; conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding conſtantly their Evening Service, with Singing one of <hi>Davids Pſalms.</hi> What Strangers ſoever were preſent, there was no putting by, or adjoyning the Worſhip of God to a more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient ſeaſon. On the Lords day, you might hear the Sermons Preached in Publick, repeated to the Family, the Servants called to give an account be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her, or what they remembred, the high Praiſes of God ſounded forth by the whole Family together. After Supper again, you might hear the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in their room, exerciſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the ſame Heavenly Duty of Singing Pſalms. And no ſooner did the <hi>good Lady</hi> hear them ſtrike up, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſhe would go to joyn with them in
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:97741:76"/>
that duty. Follow her up the ſtairs, there you ſhould be ſure to find her, twice every day, ſhut up ſome hours in her Cloſet (which was excellently fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Pious Books of Practical Divinity) Here ſhe redeemed much pretious time, in reading the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and other good Books, that might give her further light into them, and help to put more heat into that light ſhe had obtained. Here ſhe poured out her devout Soul, with ſuch fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of Spirit in Prayer, as could not be hid (ſometimes) from thoſe her Maidens, whoſe occaſions drew them, at any time, near her Cloſet dore; and yet are we not at an end of this good Ladies Devotions; for every night ſhe would, her ſelf, pray with her Maidens, before ſhe went to bed. And now, is it any wonder, ſhe grew ſo rich in Grace, who drove ſo great, and conſtant a Trade in the means of Grace, and had ſo many ways to bring her in Spiritual gains?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:97741:76"/>
               <hi>Thirdly, Her Love to God</hi> (beſides what already hath been ſaid) did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ways make it ſelf evident to be of an high degree. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The mournful complaints ſhe would make, that ſhe could love God no more; the reaſon of which indeed was, becauſe ſhe loved him ſo much. Therefore ſhe thought ſhe loved him ſo little, becauſe ſhe knew ſhe could never love him enough. The truth is, ſhe had ſuch raiſed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of Gods Glorious Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, as cauſed her to think her high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt affections unworthy of him. None, indeed, that have ſuch high appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the Divine greatneſs and goodneſs, can love him little, or think their love, when moſt, to be great. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The vehement deſires, and longings, ſhe had to be gone hence, that ſhe might be with Chriſt. She was one of thoſe very few Chriſtians, which ſtood in need of old Mr. <hi>Dods</hi> uſe of Exhortation; which I have heard he would make to the Saints, in his Preaching: <hi>That they would he content
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:97741:77"/>
and patient, though they were not taken up to Heaven ſo ſoon as they deſired.</hi> This good man (who was one of the moſt Heavenly Souls that this Age knew) finding to do this, was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing difficult in his own Soul, thought it was ordinary for others to do the like; whereas (God knows) moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, are of a lower form in Chriſts School, prone rather to linger too much here, than to be too haſty of going hence; ſo that they need rather Spur than Bridle, and Miniſters have more reaſon to take hold of them, with the ſtrongeſt Arguments they can find, to draw them out of the love of this world (as the Angels did <hi>Lot</hi> out of <hi>Sodom</hi>) than to make them willing to continue here. But this Gracious <hi>Lady,</hi> knew ſo much of Heaven, as made her ſtay here tedious to her: the earneſt option of her Soul was, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</hi> She found to her great grief, that her imperfect ſtate on Earth, made it impoſſible to ſerve God here as ſhe would, and therefore did won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:97741:77"/>
complain ſhe was unprofitable and unſerviceable; and this deep ſence of her unſerviceableneſs (while others admired her fruitfulneſs and uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) did ſtill increaſe her deſires to be, where all theſe infirmities would be cured, and where ſhe knew her ability ſhould fully correſpond to the height of her deſires ſhe had to ſerve and glorifie her God. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Her love to the Saints, who are born of God, and have his lively Image ſtamped up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. This in Scripture, is made one of the faireſt evidences for our love to God. <hi>Every one that loveth the Father that begat, loveth him that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,</hi> 1 John 5.1. A man may love the Child, and not love his Father; but he cannot love him, becauſe he is his Child, and becauſe he is like his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but he muſt needs love his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Yea love him firſt and moſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his love to the Child, ſprings from his love to the Father. This <hi>Good Lady</hi> then, was a great Lover, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, of God himſelf, becauſe ſhe had
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:97741:78"/>
ſo dear an affection to his Children. She did not praiſe the dead Saints, and perſecute the Living; ſhe did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend love to thoſe that lived far from her, but ſhewed kindneſs to them that lived near her: She did not facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly love ſome of one Party, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach thoſe of another. In a word, ſhe did not love the Saints in an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with others, from a Natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, which diſpoſeth ſome to be kind to all, good and bad; but her love was a Spiritual, Cordial, Special, and Uniform Love to them. Where-ever ſhe ſaw any thing of God, her Love was drawn out towards them, and had the moſt love for thoſe, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered moſt of God; ſhe loved them ſo, as to delight in converſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them; yea, and the chief of her Charity was extended to them. As for the Faithful Miniſters of Chriſt, whoſe Function lifts them above pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chriſtians, few ever exceeded her, in loving and honouring of them; yea, ſhe loved firſt the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> and then the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:97741:78"/>
               <hi>Miniſters</hi>; profeſſing ſeriouſly, the great love and high eſteem ſhe had for them, was for their dear Maſters ſake, whoſe Embaſſadours they were. So that what I have heard concerning her worthy Son-in-Law, in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> Sir <hi>Roger Townſend,</hi> that for his Love to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, he got the title of being called, <hi>Deliciae Cleri, The Miniſters Delight</hi>; may be truly given to her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, Her works of Charity</hi> were remarkable, upon manifold accounts. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The largeneſs of her Charity, ſo great indeed it was, that it may well be admired, how this Tree ſhould not long ago have killed it ſelf with over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing. The Trees in our Orchards yield their Fruit but once a year, taking ſo long a time to be put in heart for bearing again. But her Charity was dropping Fruit all the year long. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ways it diffuſed it ſelf; ſhe had Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver for the Monileſs aliment for the Hungry, Medicaments for the Sick, Salves for the Wounded. Abundance of good ſhe did this way, in Town
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:97741:79"/>
and Country; ſhe did not only give, but <hi>deviſed liberal things.</hi> If her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants knew of any that were in great need, and did not tell her of it, ſhe would (when by otherways ſhe heard thereof) be very angry with them. It hapned, that an honeſt poor Neighbour dyed, before ſhe knew he was ſick, for which being troubled, ſhe asked her Servant, whether he had wanted in his Sickneſs, ſaying, with ſome earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>I tell you, I had rather part with my Gown from my back, than the Poor ſhould want. Secondly,</hi> In the prime objects of her Charity, ſhe caſt her ſeed upon all ſorts of ground, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially on Gods encloſure. The Houſhold of Faith, had her fulleſt hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulls; to ſuch ſhe never thought ſhe gave enough. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Her Secreſie in giving. When it might be, ſhe did not give her Charity, as ſome throw their Money into a Baſin at a Collection, ſo that it rings again, but it fell like Oyl into a veſſel, without noiſe. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Her Self-denying Spirit in all this; ſhe
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:97741:79"/>
was no Merit-monger; <hi>good Lady,</hi> ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought to purchaſe Land in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, with the money ſhe gave on Earth. She was no Merchant to ſell her Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but a Faithful Steward, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, what ſhe gave, was not her own, but her Lords money; ſhe was, notwithſtanding all her Charity, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out to a naked Chriſt, deſiring to be found alone in him, and his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, as earneſtly, as if ſhe had not done one good work in all her life. Hear this, Oh ye Papiſts, and be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed for your notorious ſlander; who would make the world believe, that <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> is too cold a Soil for Charity to thrive in. Behold here, a <hi>Proteſtant Dorcas, full of good Works, and Alms-deeds.</hi> Though ſhe had no opinion of Merit to cheriſh the root of her Charity, from which much of yours comes, had not hope of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piating ſome foul Crimes, or conceit of meriting Heaven, been at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Charity of many in your <hi>Church,</hi> it may be believed, the firſt
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:97741:80"/>
ſtone had this day been to be laid in ſome of your Goodly Hoſpitals and Churches alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly, Her Sincerity.</hi> This was as her under Garment, which ſhe wore neareſt to her, and gave excellency to all her other Graces. Many notable teſtimonies there were for this in her. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The uniformity of her Holy Walking; her Religion was not like a drift Snow, which lyeth thick in one place, and leaves the ground bare in another; the Hypocrite hath ſome na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked plot in his Converſation, that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders him ſuſpicious; you may perſwade him with <hi>Herod, to do many things,</hi> but never make him with <hi>Saint Paul, willing in all things to live honeſtly.</hi> But in this good Ladies Converſation, one part correſponded admirably with another; an happy Symmetry appeared in her whole courſe, towards God and Man, abroad, and alſo at home, among her Domeſtick Relations, thoſe that lived conſtantly with her, who ſaw her (as we are wont to ſay) hot and cold, in
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:97741:80"/>
her night-cloaths, as well as when dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to go abroad. Few, I believe, have had an higher teſtimony for Piety, from thoſe that have lived near, and long with them, than ſhe hath from all that dwelt under her roof. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The great freedom ſhe gave her Friends in ſpeaking to her, of what they ſaw amiſs in her; ſhe was wont much to applaud the priviledge of having a Faithful Friend, ſaying, others might ſee more by us, than we by our ſelves; ſhe would alſo ſay, <hi>'Tis a great mercy to be convinced of any ſin. Thirdly,</hi> Her Faith, which was wont to be then ſtrongeſt, when death appeared near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. Like that great Souldier I have read of, who would tremble every joynt, whilſt his Armour was putting on in his Tent, but without all fear, when he engaged in the Battel. A little more than a Twelve-month ſince, ſhe fell into a long ſwound, which la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted about half an hour, without any viſible hopes of her recovery; but as ſoon as ſhe came again to her ſelf, ſhe
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:97741:81"/>
ſaid, <hi>I know my Redeemer liveth</hi>; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conveighed to her chamber, there, again, <hi>I know whom I have truſted</hi>: An Hypocrites hope is compared, to the <hi>giving up the Ghoſt,</hi> Job 11.20. And in this particular not unlike. As a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man, his breath grows ſhorter and ſhorter, till at the laſt it is quite puffed out; ſo commonly the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites hope leſſeneth, as death grows nearer, and commonly expires, before the man himſelf doth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly, Her Humility.</hi> This we may call her upper Garment, with which ſhe ſtrived to cover her other Excellencies, though their Beauty was rendered the more conſpicuous and amiable, by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting this veil over it. Grace, indeed, is like an Oyntment, which the cloſer it is held in a mans hand, the more ſtrongly it ſends forth his ſweet ſcent. Oh how meanly did ſhe think of her ſelf? ſhe ſaw not how her own Face ſhined, while others beheld and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired. Ever complaining ſhe was uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and unprofitable, and did no good.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:97741:81"/>
Never ſpake ſhe of her Perfections, but frequently other Imperfections and unworthineſs; yea, ſhe would often ſay, <hi>I abhor my ſelf, indeed I do.</hi> How eaſie of acceſs, for the meaneſt to come into her preſence? how affable, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and lowly to the pooreſt? many times, when her very Servants had done a buſineſs well, ſhe had ſet them about, ſhe would ſay I thank you, to them. <hi>The Law of kindneſs</hi> was in her Tongue, to whomſoever ſhe ſpake.</p>
            <p>I have but a word or two to ſpeak of her gracious behaviour in her laſt Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and I ſhall ſay no more of this Honourable Perſon; her Pains was ſtrong, but her Patience ſtronger; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was ſhe heard to mutter, or utter any repining word; but juſtified God in all his proceedings with her. Yea more, ſhe was much in admiring and bleſſing God for his Mercies, in her acuteſt Pains and greateſt Agonies. How doth this Bleſſed Soul now Carol forth the Praiſes of God in Heaven? who could ſing them ſo ſweetly, while
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:97741:82"/>
theſe ſharp Thorns were at her Breaſt? that could keep her Heart in tune for this high note, in her greateſt bodily pains and dolours? She was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aſſaults from <hi>Satan</hi>: it were ſtrange indeed, if he ſhould not have <hi>conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered</hi> this Pretious Servant of Chriſt, and not offered her ſome diſturbance at this time, whom he had found ſo great and old an enemy to him, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of darkneſs; but he came only to be beaten back with ſhame, and to add more Trophies to all her former Victories over him. The laſt words which, I find, were obſerved to be ſpoken by her, (before a ſleeping Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy ſeiſed on her poor ſpent body, (which in two days carried her off the ſtage of this life) were, <hi>How ſhall I do to be thankful? how ſhall I do to praiſe my God?</hi> Thus ſhe ended her life here, in the exerciſe of that Duty, which was to be her conſtant endleſs work in that life ſhe was now entring into.</p>
            <p>I have done ſpeaking of this Elect Lady, and have now only ſome refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:97741:82"/>
to make from what I have ſaid on her, upon our ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let us all be ſtirred up to give God the praiſe of thoſe his Graces, which he ſo abundantly poured into this Elect Veſſel; her light hath ſhined very radiently before moſt of your eyes, her good Works you have ſeen, and many of you been refreſhed by them; now glorifie your Father which is in Heaven; think it not enough to go home and ſay, ſhe was a good Lady, a pretious Chriſtian indeed; but as your eye paſſeth through the Air, and ſtayeth not till it terminateth on the Sun; ſo let your thoughts not ſtay in the admiring other Perfections, but paſs from her, and fix upon God the Donor, and Father of all theſe good and perfect gifts. Say not only, ſhe was a good Lady, but oh how good and gracious is God, to fill ſuch a poor Earthen veſſel, with ſo much of his Heavenly Treaſure. <hi>Again,</hi> Let us bleſs God, who hath ſo happily finiſhed
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:97741:83"/>
her courſe, and delivered her from the ſnares and miſeries of this evil world. The Souls of the deceaſed Saints, are above our Praying for them, being at reſt in a glorified ſtate; they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath our praying to them, being ſtill but Creatures in Heaven, though glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified; but they may, and ought to be the ſubjects of our Thankſgiving unto God. This is a duty, therefore, the greater, becauſe it is for the greateſt of Mercies, that which crowns the whole ſeries of Gods gracious paſt Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to them. If you think your ſelves engaged to bleſs God for your Friends, whom God hath brought ſafe home to you, after a long and dangerous jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or recovered out of a perillious Sickneſs? how much more then ſhould we be thankful, to ſee any of our Godly Friends, carried ſafe to the end of this great journey, and landed at their Heavenly Fathers Houſe? not recovered from a Sickneſs, which is but an adjournment to death; but to have ſhot deaths gulf, and to be ſet everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingly above it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:97741:83"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let the radient Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that were in her, humble us for her Deficiencies. A coorſe piece of Cloth, never appears to coorſe, as when laid by a fine; nor a Dwarff ſo low, as when ſet by one that is tall. How may her knowledge in the Scriptures, ſhame the ignorance of many of us? Her awful fear of God, the little reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence we have of the Divine Majeſty? Her zeal for God, our coldneſs? Her reverence in the Worſhip of God, the rudeneſs of many, who behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves therein, as if God Almighty, and they were fellows? Her charitable Spirit, and large Heart, whereby ſhe concerned her ſelf in the wants and miſeries of others, the narrow and ſelfiſh Spirits of many? who like the Hedghog, wrap themſelves up in their own ſoft wool, and turn out briſtles to all others. Or, who ſay with that fat <hi>Monk,</hi> ſtroking his own filled Paunch, <hi>If it be well here, all is well</hi>; though others be ſhithering with cold, pining with hunger. How may her
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:97741:84"/>
Humility, which hid ſo great Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies in her, from her own obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, put them to the bluſh, that are puffed up with their poor pittance of gifts or graces? much more, thoſe who are ſwelled with a fancy of having that, which none can ſee they have. In a word, How may her Patience, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great Afflictions, reproach the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings of many, when they feel but a little ſmart from a gentle Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? as if they would turn again upon God, and ſnatch the Rod out of his hand? I might ſay, I fear too many, that ſeem here to mourn for the loſs of this good Lady, as Chriſt to the <hi>Jews, Weep not for her, but wee for your ſelves,</hi> that you are ſo unlike to what ſhe was.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Let the high meaſures of Grace, this Pretious Servant of God attained to, encourage all weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to preſs forward, after further degrees of Grace. Sit not ſtill for ſhame, at the bottom of this Hill, when you ſee how high ſhe got in Grace and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:97741:84"/>
Godlineſs. She hath not drawn up the Ladder after her; take her courſe, tread in her ſteps, and by Gods bleſſing, though thou mayſt not come to her pitch here, yet thou ſhalt have far more than now thou haſt. She did not grow thus rich in Grace, with idleneſs and ſloth, but by Gods bleſſing on her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, in the uſe of means. She did not become ſo eminent by proudly thinking her ſelf ſo to be, but by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and Poverty of Spirit. Many had been better, if they had not thought themſelves to be better than they were.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> A word to you that had the priviledge to live in her Family: For Gods ſake look to your ſelves; happy you, if the holy Example you had in her, and extraordinary means of Grace you enjoyed under her roof, have had a kindly and powerful effect in you; if they have produced a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reſolution for an holy life. But wo be to you, that ſhall bring a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and wicked Spirit out of ſuch a
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:97741:85"/>
Pious Family; think ſeriouſly, how ſad it will be, to live ſo near Heaven in this world, as there you did, and at laſt to miſs of Heaven in the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> To thoſe that are privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged with Noble Birth, or Gentile Extraction, learn from this Lady; the beſt way in the world, to make the Tribute of Honour, which is your due, ſurely and chearfully to be payed you; take but the ſame courſe that this Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Lady, and Noble Lord her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band did, and I dare promiſe, you ſhall obtain it. Labour to be good, and to do good, be not afraid, or aſhamed to be Religious; own God in his Holy Ways, and Holy Ones; and then you ſhall be Honoured of all, but by thoſe that refuſe to Honour God himſelf: And who would accept of Honour at their hands, who rob God of his? you have the Word of God for this, <hi>Them that honour me, I will honour,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.30. <hi>By Humility, and the fear of the Lord, are Riches, and Honour, and Life,</hi> Prov. 22.4. A place of Scripture, which God
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:97741:85"/>
fulfilled, remarkably, in the deceaſed Lady. It fareth with Gentlemens Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, as it doth with Tradeſmens Wares, which while they are made true and good, their price keeps up in the Market; but when they are made with little care, and of bad ſtuff, then it falls, and they hardly go off.</p>
            <p>Oh defile not your Honours by any debaucheries; <hi>Dignitas in indigno eſt ornamentum in Luto,</hi> ſaith <hi>Salvian.</hi> What pity is it a Scarlet Cloak ſhould be ſopt in a ſwill tub? The corruption of the beſt is the worſt. I do not clear thoſe of ſin, who do not give him the Honour due to his Title and Place, that is unworthy of them; but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, that thoſe whom God hath left ſo high in dignity above others, ſhould conſider, that it is their duty, and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom alſo, to ſhun all that may lead their Inferiours into this Temptation. How can he be free to complain of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, denying him his Honour, who by his own prophaneneſs and wickedneſs, caſts
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:97741:86"/>
more diſhonour on himſelf, than any other can do? To be diſhonourable, is worſe than to be diſhonoured, as much as a ſin is worſe, than an affliction. The Good and Pious, are ſometimes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured by thoſe that are wicked, even for that which is their higheſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; but it is ſin and wickedneſs that makes a perſon diſhonourable, as alſo it doth a Nation, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.35. <hi>But ſin is a reproach to any People.</hi>
