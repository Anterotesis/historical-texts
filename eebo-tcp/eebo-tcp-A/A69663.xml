            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And let me deprecate thee the least suspition of malice in me to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the man, or his memory; the which I was so far and free from in his life time, that a little before his death, my selfe with two other godly, reverend brethren, went to his lodging in the <hi>Tower,</hi> to tender our Christian duty of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to him, for Counsell and comfort (if it would be accepted) in that his condition. But by his Secretary he returning Court-thanks, said, some had been with him that day, and now he was otherwise imployed in his private businesse. Whereupon we returned: And that morning Mr. Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the <hi>Tower</hi> having been with him, and taking his leave with these words, <hi>I pray God open your eyes:</hi> he returned him thankes, Saying, <hi>And I pray God open your eyes; and I hope there is no harme in that.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:51715:3"/>
By which he would cunningly insinuate, that Master Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants eyes were blinded, rather then his. But more of this legierdemain anon; and for this task, I was first ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly importuned by two reverend godly Ministers, to under take it, which I took as a call from God.</p>
            <p>Now for his <hi>Funerall Sermon,</hi> how it could be true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said to be preacht, when he read it <hi>verbatim,</hi> as also how he could properly be said to pray, what he read in his paper (for without his book he could neither preach,<note place="margin">Clericus absquc li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bro.</note> nor pray) I leave it to thy right judgement.</p>
            <p>Finally, that such a poysonfull peece as this should be so licentiously published in Print, before some Antidote were prepared, either to correct its Malignancy, or to corroborate the simple hearted people, apt to drink in such a sugared poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from the mouth of such a bold dying man, though a Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: if understanding men do not wonder, I shall confesse my selfe the only foole to marvaile. But I hope this Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote will not come altogether too late to recover such, as whose weaker stomacks have not been able to overcome the poyson. <hi>Farewell.</hi>

            <p>HOw ever the <hi>good People</hi> may <hi>Pardon</hi> his <hi>old memory</hi> for reading, instead of preaching; yet how the righteous God should pardon such an <hi>old memory,</hi> as could not remember one of all those grosse sins, wherein he had lived, so as to confesse them, and to crave pardon of God for them, I cannot see, I dare not say: He did with <hi>Adam hide his transgressions</hi> in his bosome;<note place="margin">Job. 31.33. Josh. 7. Mat. 27.3.</note> he would not with <hi>Achan</hi> confesse his <hi>sinne that troubled</hi> Israel, <hi>to give glory to God</hi>; nor with the Traitor <hi>Judas repent</hi> of his <hi>Treason,</hi> nor restore the <hi>price of innocent blood,</hi> which he had shed, nor confesse at all his sin of treason: Yea, when Mr. <hi>Weld,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Jones,</hi> and others, came to him in the <hi>Tower</hi> to demand of him recompense for all the wrongs he had done them in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, credits, and estates, he could never be brought to acknowledge the least, saying he remembred no such thing, thus laying all the burthen upon his <hi>old memory,</hi> living and dying.</p>
            <p>And yet in his next words he addes; <hi>And upon so sad occasions, as I am come to this place.</hi> A <hi>sad occasion</hi> sure, had he been so sensible of it, as he should have been: Wherein, though his <hi>old memory</hi> failed him, yet his <hi>old</hi> Conscience (surer to keep, then a thousand <hi>memories</hi>) might have helped him. But it seems, that not only his long habituated wickednesse had feared, and brought his Conscience into a deep Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy, or dead sleep, but surely some compounded Cordiall by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries Art, had so wrought with him, that not only it caused him to have a ruddy fresh countenance, but also did so prop up his spirits, that he might seem, as <hi>Agag,</hi> to have already swallowed down the bitter cup of death, and that the world might take him to die as some innocent Martyr, as all his <hi>Sermon</hi> would set him forth, and for which end it was penned, if not also Printed. But how <hi>sad</hi> soever the <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of his death was to him, or no: sure we are the occasions thereof (which was in sum, high Treason, in the belly whereof, (as in that <hi>Trojan</hi> horse) were so many cruell practises, and crafty conveyances closely couched, the very s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:51715:4"/>
if his cause had been good, and his conscience innocent, he needed not have complained of the uncomfortablenesse of the place. The Martyrs did not so, who coming to the Stake, cheerfully saluted it with a kisse.</p>
            <p>And could his <hi>Old memory</hi> have remembred that Pillory-suffering, not much above seven years standing, which his Conscience at least might have suggested unto him, how a certain<note n="*" place="margin">Being not long before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded.</note> 
               <hi>quondam</hi> Preacher standing in the Pillory, pleasantly said; <hi>I never preacht in such a Pulpit before</hi>; saying also to the people, (and that with a Repetition for their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance) <hi>little do you know what fruit God is able to produce out of this dry Tree</hi>: making the Pillory all the while his triumphall Chariot, while that <hi>Canterburian Prelate</hi> (together with <hi>Con</hi> the Popes Nuntio, and other Compeers) was a triumphant spectator out of the Star-Chamber; he little dreamed then, that such a Pillory could in the space of seven years grow to such a bulke, as whereof to hew out, and erect a <hi>Scaffold</hi> on the Tower-Hill, where himself should loose his head for others ears: perhaps one of the <hi>fruits</hi> of that <hi>dry Tree</hi>; so that if the innocent cause and conscience of one, made the Pillory such a <hi>comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Pulpit</hi>: sure it must be the contrary cause and conscience, that makes the <hi>Scaffold</hi> such an <hi>uncomfortable place,</hi> for the <hi>Prelate to preach upon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well he takes his Text: <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1, 2. <hi>Let us run,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Looking unto Iesus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Miserable man! Never was a holy Text so unhallowed, so miserably abused, so corruptly glossed upon, so shamefully perverted, as this <hi>Text.</hi> And doth he call about him that <hi>cloud of witnesses (ver.</hi> 1.) those holy Patriarchs and believers of the Old Testament, to witnesse the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of a lying Traitor, as if a dying Martyr?</p>
            <p>Surely this man in his race had often an eye unto <hi>Iesus,</hi> that is to the Name JESVS, whereof he was a very devout Adorer, and so zealous, that he suspended me once from preaching against the superstitious bowing at the nameing of that Name. So as however he looked unto <hi>Iesus,</hi> yet he never shewed such a favourable aspect upon Christ, whom in his swift footed zeale (untill in the Tower, the sinew of his leg, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any violence, had a terrible crack, that he could not now <hi>run</hi> so fast in his <hi>race,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 9.</note> as before) he so cruelly persecuted in his servants and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: So as by this time himself knows sufficiently, with what eye he looked <hi>unto Iesus,</hi> as whom he findes a just Iudge, and punisher of that faith of his, which was none other but that of <hi>Babylon</hi>; as the Reader may see at large in my <note n="*" place="margin">Reply. Pag. 166, to 170, 173.</note> 
               <hi>Reply</hi> to his <hi>Relation of a conference,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>That he is <hi>now come to the end of his race,</hi> though <hi>long,</hi> we blesse God.</p>
            <p>But here he findes the <hi>Crosse, a death of shame.</hi> And why so <hi>shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> the <hi>Crosse,</hi> which he so honoured and adored in his life, witnesse
<pb facs="tcp:51715:4"/>
the goodly Crucifix over his Altar at Lambeth, White-hall, and else where, which he was not wont to passe by unsaluted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the same must be despised, or there is no coming to the right hand of God.</hi> How, <hi>must</hi> that <hi>shame</hi> be <hi>despised,</hi> which the righteous hand of God brought him unto? Why did he not acknowledge it a <hi>shame</hi> most due unto him, for all the dishonour he had done to God in his life time? Or why did he petition the <hi>Lords,</hi> that he might not dye the more shamefull death of the <hi>halter,</hi> but rather of the <hi>hatchet,</hi> as more sutable for one, who had sat so long and oft, at those late <hi>Honorable boards,</hi> as also in the prsent <hi>Parliament</hi>? Nay, had he had any one sparke of true <hi>Grace,</hi> (over and above that of <hi>Canterbury</hi>) considering the numberlesse shamefull acts that were perpetrated by him with a shamelesse forehead, and remorslesse conscience: he would with <hi>Origen</hi> (for but once offering incense to the <hi>Idol</hi>) have said to all the people, <hi>Calcate me insipidum salem, trample upon me, as unsavoury salt:</hi> and he would have Petitioned, that he might have the most shamefull death, yea <hi>hanging, drawing,</hi> and <hi>quartering,</hi> that head and limbes might be set up for everlasting monuments of such an enemy of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>State.</hi> This had been the <hi>way</hi> to <hi>come</hi> at length to <hi>Christs right hand,</hi> to have found him his <hi>Iesus,</hi> and not to his left, to finde him his Judge: But for <hi>Gods right hand,</hi> that is proper to <hi>Christ</hi> alone.</p>
            <p>But he is so far from this shame, that he adds, <hi>God forbid I should despise the shame for him.</hi> What? A <hi>shame</hi> suffered for <hi>Christ</hi>? A <hi>shame despised,</hi> being a most condigne punishment? <hi>Christ</hi> is said to <hi>despise the shame</hi> by a voluntary undergoing it in our steads, but this man <hi>despiseth the shame,</hi> by a desperate contempt, in suffering it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force, against his will.</p>
            <p>But he tells us, <hi>his feet are now upon the brinke of the Red-sea: an argument</hi> (he hopes) <hi>that God was bringing him to the land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, for that was the way, by which of old he led his people.</hi> O poore man!

            <p>He saith, <hi>Men can have no more power over him, then that which is given them from above.</hi> Innocent Christ spake those words, and onely he might properly speak them: and not any such <hi>malefactor,</hi> as this, on whom the just lawes of the land had immediate power thus to punish him; whereas <hi>Pilate</hi> had no such legall power over innocent Christ to <hi>put him to death,</hi> but only from an extraordinary divine dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But thus this man hath taken a lawlesse liberty to himselfe all along, thus intolerably to abuse the Sacred Scriptures, beating this gold by force of his hammer so thin, that he may therewith guild over his rotten cause, thereby to deceive the simple at his death, as he had done in his life; who are apt to <hi>take all for gold, that glittereth.</hi>

Nor could he finde a word in Scripture to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie Sir <hi>John Clotworthie's</hi> question, for any assurance that hee had of a better life. And just was this with God the righteous Iudge, that as hee was a great decryer and vilifier of the Scripture, as: <hi>The light which is in Scripture it selfe,</hi>

               <hi>is not bright enough, it cannot beare sufficient witnesse to it selfe: That the beliefe of Scripture to be the Word of God, dependeth primari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the authority &amp; tradition of the present Church: That it is a candle which hath no light, till it be lighted, which is first by the tradition of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Church.</hi> That notwithstanding these and many more most grosse derogations from the selfe-sufficiency, authority, and light of Scriptures to demonstrate it selfe to be the word of God, he saith, <hi>hee hath given to the Scripture enough, and more then enough,</hi> &amp;c. Iust (I say) was it with God, that this wretched Prelate, for so vilifying, yea annihilating
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51715:12"/>
the sufficiency of Scripture-light, should bee lost altogether without so much light, as to light him to so much as one place of Scripture, that might minister unto him some solid comfort at the houre of his death. As some Malefactors trusting to their neck-vers, when they came before the Iudge, were not able to read one word of the booke. And though he said to Sir <hi>John,</hi> that <hi>that word was the knowledge of Jesus Christ, and that alone:</hi> yet this gracelesse wretch was never acquainted with this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Iesus Christ.

He never had Christs spirit, and therefore was none of Christs.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> He had not the spirit of grace &amp; sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, he had not the spirit of prayer even unto his death, as hee had been a quencher of this spirit of prayer, in all those in whom he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it to be. For he was altogether for book-prayers, as here he was at his death. Such was his last prayer, which was in his hand: And this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er (if a prayer) is to be interpreted as the former, all <hi>for mercy,</hi> but wwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>repentance; for this Kingdome,</hi> but in reference to <hi>Tyranny,</hi> to his <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion,</hi> to this his <hi>Church of England.</hi> Thus he dyes one that was ever true to his old principles, as in his life, so at his death, and thus hee is as good as his word in his Relation, where he tells the King thus: <hi>In the publishing hereof, I have obeyed your Majesty,</hi>
