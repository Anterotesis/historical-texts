         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>EW ENGLAND,
ſo call'd, not onely (to
auoyd nouelties) becauſe
Captaine <hi>Smith</hi> hath ſo
entituled it in his Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but becauſe of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
that is in it, of
England the natiue ſoile of
Engliſh-men; It being
much what the ſame for
heate and colde in Summer and Winter, it being
Champion ground, but not high mountaines, ſomwhat
like the ſoile in <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Eſſex;</hi> full of Dales, and med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
ground, full of ryuers and ſweete ſprings, as Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
is. But principally, ſo farre as we can yet find, it is
an Iland, and neere about the quantitie of England, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cut off from the maine land of <hi>America,</hi> as England
is from the maine of <hi>Europe,</hi> by a great arme of the Sea,
which entreth in fortie degrees, and runneth vp North
weſt and by Weſt, and goeth out either into the South
<pb facs="tcp:22594:3"/>
Sea, or elſe into the Bay of <hi>Canado.</hi> The certaintie
whereof, and ſecrets of which, we haue not yet ſo found
as that as eye-witneſſes we can make narration thereof,
but if God giue time and meanes, we ſhall ere long, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
both the extent of that Riuer, together with the
ſecrets thereof; and alſo try what territories, habitations,
or commodities, may be found, either in it, or about
it.</p>
            <p>It pertaineth not to my purpoſe to ſpeake any thing,
either in prayſe, or diſprayſe of the country, ſo it is by
Gods prouidence, that a few of vs are there planted to
our content, and haue with great charge and difficultie
attained quiet and competent dwellings there. And
thus much I will ſay for the ſatisfaction of ſuch as haue
any thought of going thither to inhabit; That for men
which haue a large heart, &amp; looke after great riches, eaſe,
pleaſure, dainties, and iollitie in this world (except they
will liue by other mens ſweat, or haue great riches) I
would not aduiſe them to come there, for as yet the
country will afford no ſuch matters: But if there be any,
who are content to lay out their eſtates, ſpend their time,
labours, and endeuours, for the benefit of them that
ſhall come after, and in deſire to further the Goſpell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
thoſe poore Heathens, quietly contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
with ſuch hardſhip and difficulties, as by Gods
prouidence ſhall fall vpon them, being yet yong, and in
their ſtrength, ſuch men I would aduiſe and encourage
to goe, for their ends cannot faile them.</p>
            <p>And if it ſhould pleaſe God to puniſh his people in
the Chriſtian countries of <hi>Europe,</hi> (for their coldneſſe,
carnality, wanton abuſe of the Goſpel, contention, &amp;c.)
either by Turkiſh ſlauery, or by Popiſh tyrannie, which
God forbid, yet if the time be come, or ſhall come (as
who knoweth) when Sathan ſhall be let looſe,<note place="margin">Reu. 12. 14. 15</note> to caſt
out his flouds againſt them, here is a way opened for
ſuch as haue wings to flie into this Wilderneſſe; and as
<pb facs="tcp:22594:3"/>
by the diſperſion of the Iewiſh Church thorow per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,<note place="margin">Act. 11. 20. 21.</note>
the Lord brought in the fulneſſe of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
ſo who knoweth, whether now by tyrannie, and
affliction, which he ſuffereth to come vpon them, he
will not by little and little chaſe them, even amongſt
the Heathens,<note place="margin">Luk. 2. 32.</note> that ſo a light may riſe vp in the darke,
and the kingdome of heauen be taken from them which
now haue it,<note place="margin">Math. 21. 43.</note> and giuen to a people that ſhall bring forth
the fruit of it. This I leaue to the iudgement of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wiſe,<note place="margin">Amos 7. 14.</note> being neither Prophet nor ſonne of a Prophet,
but conſidering Gods dealing of olde,<note place="margin">2 King. 17. 23.</note> and ſeeing the
name of Chriſtian to be very great, but the true nature
thereof almoſt quite loſt in all degrees &amp; ſects, I cannot
thinke but that there is ſome iudgement not farre off,
and that God will ſhortly, euen of ſtones, rayſe vp chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
vnto <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 3. 5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And who ſo rightly conſidereth, what manner of
entrance, abiding, and proceedings, we haue had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
theſe poore Heathens ſince we came hither, will
eaſily thinke, that God hath ſome great worke to doe
towards them.</p>
            <p>They were wont to be the moſt cruelleſt and treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſeſt
people in all theſe parts, euen like Lyons, but to
vs they haue beene like Lambes, ſo kinde, ſo ſubmiſſiue,
and truſtie, as a man may truely ſay many Chriſtians are
not ſo kinde, nor ſincere.</p>
            <p>They are very much waſted of late, by reaſon of a
great mortalitie that fell amongſt them three yeares
ſince, which together with their owne ciuill diſſenſions
and blouddie warres, hath ſo waſted them, as I thinke
the twentith perſon is ſcarce left aliue, and thoſe that are
left, haue their courage much abated, and their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
is deiected, and they ſeeme as a people affrighted.
And though when we came firſt into the countrie, we
were few, and many of vs were ſicke, and many dyed
by reaſon of the colde and wet, it being the depth of
<pb facs="tcp:22594:4"/>
winter, and we hauing no houſes, nor ſhelter, yet when
there was not ſixe able perſons amongſt vs, and that
they came daily to vs by hundreths, with their <hi>Sachems,</hi>
or <hi>Kings,</hi> and might in one houre haue made a diſpatch
of vs yet ſuch a feare was vpon them, as that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
offred vs the leaſt iniury in word or deede. And by
reaſon of one <hi>Tiſquanto,</hi> that liues amongſt vs, that can
ſpeake Engliſh, we haue daily commerce with their
<hi>Kings,</hi> &amp; can know what is done or intended towards
vs amongſt the Savages; Alſo we can acquaint them
with our courſes and purpoſes, both humane and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.
And the greateſt Commander of the countrie
call'd <hi>Maſſaſoit,</hi> commeth often to viſite vs, though hee
liue fiftie myles from vs, and often ſends vs preſents,
he hauing with many other of their gouernours promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
yea, ſubſcribed obedience to our Soueraigne Lord
King IAMES, and for his cauſe to ſpend both ſtrength
and life. And we for our parts, thorow Gods grace,
haue with that equitie, juſtice, and compaſſion, carried
our ſelues towards them, as that they haue receiued
much fauour, helpe, and ayde from vs, but neuer the
leaſt iniury, or wrong by vs. Wee found the place
where we liue emptie,<note place="margin">They offer vs to dwell where we will.</note> the people being all dead &amp; gone
away, and none liuing neere by 8. or 10. myles; and
and though in the time of ſome hardſhip wee found
(trauelling abroad) ſome 8. Buſhels of Corne hid vp
in a Caue, and knew no owners of it, yet afterward
hearing of the owners of it, we gaue them (in their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation)
double the value of it. Our care alſo hath
beene to maintaine peace amongſt them, and haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
ſet our ſelues againſt ſuch of them as vſed any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
or trecherie againſt their gouernours, and not
onely threatned ſuch, but in ſome ſort payd them their
due deſerts; and when any of them are in want, as often
they are in the Winter, when their corne is done, wee
ſupply them to our power, and haue them in our houſes
<pb facs="tcp:22594:4"/>
eating and drinking, and warming themſelues, which
thing (though it be ſomething a trouble to vs) ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they ſhould ſee and take knowledge of our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
orders, and diligence, both for this life and a
better, we are content to beare it, and we find in many
of them, eſpecially, of the younger ſort, ſuch a tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
diſpoſition, both to Religion and humanitie, as that
if we had meanes to apparell them, &amp; wholly to retaine
them with vs (as their deſire is) they would doubtleſſe
in time proue ſeruiceable to God and man, and if euer
God ſend vs meanes we will bring vp hundreths of their
children, both to labour and learning.</p>
            <p>But leauing to ſpeake of them till a further occaſion
be offered; If any ſhall maruell at the publiſhing of this
Treatiſe in England, ſeeing there is no want of good
bookes, but rather want of men to vſe good bookes,
let them know, that the eſpeciall end is, that wee may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
keepe thoſe motiues in memory for our ſelues, &amp; thoſe
that ſhall come after, to be a remedie againſt ſelfe-loue
the bane of all ſocieties. And that alſo we might teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
to our Chriſtian Country-men, who iudge diuerſly
of vs, that though we be in a Heathen Country, yet the
grace of Chriſt is not quenched in vs, but we ſtill hold,
and teach the ſame points of faith, mortification, and
ſanctification, which we haue heard and learned in a
moſt ample and large maner in our owne country. If
any ſhall thinke it too rude and vnlearned for this curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
age,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 4.</note> let them know, that to paint out the Goſpell in
plaine and flat Engliſh, amongſt a company of plaine
Engliſh-men (as we are) is the beſt and moſt profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt
teaching; and we will ſtudy plainneſſe, not curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie,
neither in things humaine, nor heauenly. If any
error, or vnſoundneſſe be in it, (as who knoweth) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
it to that frayle man which endited it,<note place="margin">Chap. 8. 2.</note> which profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
to know nothing as he ought to know it. I haue
not ſet downe my name, partly becauſe I ſeeke no
<pb facs="tcp:22594:5"/>
name, and principally, becauſe I would haue nothing
eſteemed by names, for I ſee a number of euils to ariſe
thorow names, when the perſons are either famous, or
infamous, and God and man is often iniured; if any
good or profit ariſe to thee in the receiuing of it, giue
God the prayſe, and eſteeme me as a ſonne of <hi>Adam,</hi>
ſubiect to all ſuch frailties as other men are.</p>
            <p>And you my louing Friends the Aduenturers to this
plantation; as your care hath beene, firſt to ſettle reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
here, before either profit or popularitie, ſo I pray
you, goe on, to doe it much more, and be carefull to
ſend godly men, though they want ſome of that world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
policie which this world hath in her owne generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 8.</note>
and ſo though you looſe, the Lord ſhall gayne. I
reioyce greatly in your free and readie mindes to your
powers, yea, and beyond your powers to further this
worke,<note place="margin">Pro. 3. 9.</note> that you thus honour God with your riches,
and I truſt you ſhall be repayed againe double &amp; treble
in this world, yea, and the memory of this action ſhall
neuer die, but aboue all adding vnto this (as I truſt you
doe) like freeneſſe in all other Gods ſeruices, both at
home and abroad, you ſhall finde a reward with GOD,
ten thouſand fold ſurpaſſing all that you can doe or
thinke, be not therefore diſcouraged, for no labour is
loſt, nor money ſpent, which is beſtowed for God,
your ends were good, your ſucceſſe is good, and your
profit is comming, euen in this life, and in the life to
come much more; And what ſhall I ſay now, a word

<hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> was becauſe of the abuſes which were in
the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi> Which abuſes aroſe
cheifly thorow ſwelling pride, ſelfe-loue and
conceitednes, for although this Church were
planted by <hi>Paul,</hi> and watred by <hi>Apollo,</hi> and
much increaſed by the Lord; yet the ſower of
tares was not wanting to ſtirre vp euill
workers and fleſhly minded hypocrites,<note place="margin">Math. 13. 25.</note> vnder a ſhew of godlines,

firſt, in their carnall deuiſions, Chap. 1. then in their extolling
their eloquent teachers, and deſpiſing <hi>Paul, Chap.</hi> 4. Then in
their offenſiue going to Law, before the heathen Iudges Chap. 6.
Then in eating things offered to Idols, to the deſtroying of the
tender conſciences of their Brethren, Chap. 8. Then in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable
loue-feaſtes, in the time and place of their Church mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
the rich which could together feede to fulnes, deſpiſing and
contemning the poore, that had not to lay it on as they had, Chap
11.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 13.</note> Finally in both the Epiſtles, hee very often nippeth them
for their pride, and ſelfe-loue, ſtraitneſſe and cenſoriouſhes, ſo
that in the laſt Chapter hee willeth them againe and againe to

yet as men that row in Boats,<note place="margin">Similie.</note> ſet their faces earneſtly one way,
when yet their whole body goeth apace another way: ſo there
are many which ſet ſuch a face vppon Religion,<note place="margin">Iude 16.</note> and haue their

ſound remedie be thought of, which remedie is euen that which
our Sauiour teacheth the rich young gallant, and which <hi>Paul</hi>
heere preſcribeth,<note place="margin">Math. 19. 21.</note> in willing them not to ſeeke their owne, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
man anothers wealth, which Phyſicke is as terrible to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
profeſſors, as abſtinence from drinke is to a man that hath
the dropſie: and it is a ſure note, that a man is ſicke of this diſeaſe
of ſelfe-loue, if this be grieuous to him, as appeareth in the man
whom Chriſt bid ſell that hee had,<note place="margin">Ver. 22.</note> and hee went away very ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull,
yet ſurely this veine muſt bee pricked, and this humor
let out, els it will ſpoyle all, it will infect both ſoule and body, yea
and the contagion of it is ſuch (as wee ſhall ſee anone) as will euen
hazard the welfare of that ſocietie, where ſelfe ſeekers and ſelfe
louers are.</p>
            <p>As God then did direct this Apoſtle to lay downe this briefe
direction as a remedy for that euill in <hi>Corinth,</hi> ſo you may thinke
it is by Gods ſpeciall providence,<note place="margin">Act. 10. 33.</note> that I am now to ſpeake vnto
you from this text: and ſay in your hearts ſurely ſome thing is
amiſſe this way: let vs know it and amend it.</p>
            <p>The parts of this text are two.<note place="margin">Diuiſion.</note> 1. a <hi>Dehortation,</hi> 2. an <hi>Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
The Dehortation. <hi>Let no man ſeeke his owne.</hi> The Exhortation
<hi>But euery man anothers wealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In handling of which,<note place="margin">Order of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> I will firſt, open the wordes. Secondly,
gather the Doctrine. Thirdly, illuſtrate the Doctrine by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
experience and Reaſons. Fourthly, apply the ſame, to euery
one his portion.</p>
            <p>The proper drift of the Apoſtle heere is not to taxe the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
for ſeeking their owne euill endes in euill actions,<note place="margin">The Apoſtles drift.</note> but for
aiming at themſelues, and their owne benefits in actions lawfull,
and that appeareth in the former verſe, where he ſayth. <hi>All things
are lawfull &amp;c.</hi> viz. all ſuch thinges as now wee ſpeake of, to eate
any of Gods creatures, offered to Idols or not, to feaſt and bee
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:22594:6"/>
merrie together, to ſhew loue and kindneſſe to this or that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
&amp;c. but when by ſuch meanes wee ſeeke our ſelues, and haue
not a charitable louing and reuerent regard of others, then they
are vnexpedient, vnprofitable, yea vnlawfull, and muſt bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne,
and hee that hath not learned to denie himſelfe euen the
very vſe of lawfull things, when it tendeth to the contempt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch,
greife offence, and ſhame of his other Brethren and Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciats,
hath learned nothing aright, but is apparantly a man that
ſeekes himſelfe, and againſt whom the Apoſtle heere dealeth moſt
properly.</p>
            <p>The maner of the ſpeech may ſeeme as counſell left at libertie:<note place="margin">Expoſition.</note>
as Mat. 27. 49. and in our ordinary ſpeech, wee thinke they be
but weake charges, which are thus deliuered, let a man doe this,
or let him doe that. But wee muſt learne the Apoſtles modeſtie, and
know that whatſoeuer the termes ſeeme to imply, yet euen this
and other the like in this Epiſtle, are moſt abſolute charges: as
<hi>Let a man eſteeme of vs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 4. 1.</note> 
               <hi>as the miniſters of Chriſt,</hi> that is, a man ought
ſo to eſteeme of vs.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Let a man examine himſelfe,</hi> that is, as if he ſayd
a man muſt examine himſelfe,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 34.</note> 
               <hi>Let your women keepe ſilence in the
Churches.</hi> that is, they ought ſo to doe.</p>
            <p>The meaning then ſummarily is, as if hee ſayd, the bane of all
theſe miſcheifes which ariſe amongſt you is, that men are to
cleauing to themſelues, and their owne matters, and diſregarde
and contemne all others: and therefore I charge you, let this ſelfe-ſeeking
be left off, and turne the ſtreame another way, namely,
ſeeke the good of your Brethren, pleaſe them, honor them, r<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
them, for otherwiſe it will neuer goe well amongſt you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But doth not the Apoſtle elſe whereſay?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> That hee, which careth
not for his owne,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 8.</note> is worſe then an Infidell.</p>
            <p>True but by (owne) there, he meaneth properly,<note place="margin">Reſp.</note> a mans kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
and heere by (owne) hee meaneth properly a mans ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Hee there eſpecially taxeth ſuch as were negligent in
their labours and callings, and ſo made themſelues vnable to giue
releife and entertainement to ſuch poore Widowes and Orphans as
were of their owne fleſh and bloud.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Be it ſo that ſome man ſhould euen neglect his owne
ſelfe, his owne wife, children, friends, &amp;c. and giue that hee had
to ſtrangers, that were but ſome rare vice, in ſome one vnnaturall
man, and if this vice ſtay a thouſand, ſelfe-loue ſlayeth ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</p>
            <p>And this the wiſedome of God did well forſee, and hath ſet no
caueats in the Scriptures either to taxe men, or forewarne them
from louing others, neither ſayth God any wher, let no man ſeeke
the good of another, but let no man ſeeke his owne, and euerie
where in the Scriptures he hath ſet watch words againſt ſelfe-good,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:22594:7"/>
ſelfe-profit, ſelfe-ſeeking, &amp;c. And thus the ſence beeing cleared,
I come to the doctrine.</p>
            <p>All men are to to apt and readie to ſeeke themſelues to much,<note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> and
to preferre their owne matters and cauſes beyond the due and
lawfull meaſure,<note place="margin">Amplific.</note> euen to exceſſe and offence againſt God, yea
danger of their owne ſoules, and this is true not onely in wicked
men which are giuen ouer of God to vile luſts, as <hi>Abſolon</hi> in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

               <hi>who will ſhew vs any good,</hi> and pretend

which yet cryed out when will the Sabboth bee done, that wee may

of gold is their confidence,<note place="margin">Iob 31. 24.</note> their hearts are ſet vpon the pelfe of this
world, and for loue of it, all thinges are let ſlipp, euen all duties to
God or men, they care not how baſely they ſerue, how wretchedly
they neglect all others, ſo as they may get wealth: pinch who will?
and wring who will, all times are alike with them, and they runne
for the bribe like <hi>Gehazie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 King. 5. 21.</note> and this is the firſt way that men ſeeke
their owne.</p>
            <p>Now the contrary is ſeene in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Neh. 5. 14. 15. 16.</note> who when the people were
hard put to it, and the land raw, he tooke not the dueties which
were due to him being a Magiſtrate, he bought no land, nor grewe
not rich, for it was no time: but he maintained at his table many of
his brethren the Iewes,<note place="margin">Act. 20.</note> and ſo ſpent euen his owne proper goods.
And <hi>Paul</hi> ſought not mans gold nor ſiluer,<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 3. 9.</note> but though hee had au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
yet he tooke not bread of the Churches, but laboured with
his hands: And why? It was no time to take, ſome Churches were
poore and ſtood in want,<note place="margin">Ver. 8.</note> as <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> others were in danger to be
preyed vpon by couetous belly-gods,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 12.</note> as <hi>Corinth:</hi> and therefore hee
ſaw it no fit time now to take any thing of them.</p>
            <p>And indeede heere is the difference betweene a couetous world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and an honeſt thriftie Chriſtian, it is lawfull ſometimes for
men to gather wealth, and grow rich, euen as there was a time for
<hi>Ioſeph</hi> to ſtore vp corne,<note place="margin">Gen. 41. 49.</note> but a godly and ſincere Chriſtian will ſee
when this time is, and will not hord vp when he ſeeth others of his
brethren and aſſociates to want, but then is a time, if hee haue any
thing to fetch it out and diſperſe it, but the couetous gather good, he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:22594:8"/>
like <hi>Achan</hi> couets all that he ſeeth,<note place="margin">Ioſh. 7. 21.</note> and neglects no time, but ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſtill and holds all faſt, and if it were to ſaue the life of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
his baggs muſt not be miniſhed, nor his cheſtes lighted, nor his
field ſet to ſale, gather as much as he can, but its death to diminiſh
the leaſt part of it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond way by which men ſeeke their owne, is when they
ſeeke eaſe,<note place="margin">Luke 11. 46.</note> or pleaſure, as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſies,</hi> who would not
touch the burthen with one of their fingers; so, there is a generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which thinke to haue more in this world then <hi>Adams</hi> felicitie
in Innocencie,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 15.</note> being borne (as they thinke) to take their pleaſures,
and their eaſe,<note place="margin">Eccle. 10. 18.</note> let the roofe of the houſe drop thorow, they ſtirre
not;<note place="margin">Pro. 24. 30. 31.</note> let the field be ouer-growne with weeds, they care not, they
muſt not ſoile their hand, nor wet their foote, its enough for them
to ſay, Goe you, not let vs goe, though neuer ſo much need; ſuch
idle Droanes are intollerable in a ſetled Common-wealth, much
more in a Common-wealth which is but as it were in the bud; of
what earth I pray thee art thou made, of any better then other of
the ſonnes of <hi>Adam?</hi> And canſt thou ſee other of thy brethren toile
their hearts out, and thou ſit idle at home, or takeſt thy pleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad?
Remember the example of <hi>Vriah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 11. 11.</note> who would not take his
eaſe, nor his pleaſure, though the King required him, and why?
Becauſe his brethren, his aſſociates, better men then himſelfe (as he
eſteemed them) were vnder hard labours and conditions, lay in
the fields in tents, caues, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third way is when men ſeeke their owne bellies, as ſome did
in the Apoſtles times, which went about with new doctrines and
deuices,<note place="margin">Rom. 16. 26.</note> knowing that the people had itching eares, and would ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
entertaine, and willingly feede ſuch noueliſts, which brought in
diſſenſions, ſchiſmes, and contentions, and ſuch were rocks, or pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
in their loue-feaſts,<note place="margin">Iude 12.</note> as <hi>Iude</hi> ſpeaketh, they were ſhaddowes in
Gods ſeruice, but when feaſting came, then they were ſubſtances,
then they were in their element. And certainely there are ſome men
which ſhape euen their Religion, humaine ſtate, and all, euen as the
belly cheare is beſt, and that they muſt haue, els all heart and life is
gone, let all conſcience, care of others goe, let <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſtarue at the
gate, let <hi>Ioſephs</hi> affliction be increaſed, they muſt haue their diſhes,
their dainties,<note place="margin">Neh. 5. 14.</note> or no content. The contrary was ſeene in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi>
who would not take his large portion alotted to the gouernour,
becauſe he knew it went ſhort with others of his brethren; and <hi>Vriah</hi>
would not receiue the Kings preſent and goe banquet with his wife,
becauſe he knew the whole Hoaſt his brethren were faine to ſnap
ſhort in the fields.</p>
            <p>And the difference betweene a temperate good man, and a belly-God
is this:<note place="margin">Iob 31. 17.</note> A good man will not eate his morſels alone, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if he haue better then other, but if by Gods prouidence, he haue
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:22594:8"/>
gotten ſome meate which is better then ordinary, and better then
his other brethrens, he can haue no reſt in himſelfe, except he make
other partaker with him. But a belly-God will ſlop all in his owne
throat, yea, though his neighbour come in and behold him eate,
yet his griple gut ſhameth not to ſwallow all. And this may be done
ſometimes, as well in meane fare as in greater dainties, for all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
afford not alike.</p>
            <p>The fourth way by which men ſeeke their owne, is by ſeeking <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
outward honour,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 30.</note> fame, and reſpect with men, as King <hi>Saul</hi> when he
had loſt all reſpect and fauour with God, then thought to giue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to his heart by being honoured before the Elders of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and it is wonderfull to ſee how ſome men are <hi>deſirous of vaine
glory,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 26.</note> and how earneſtly they ſeeke prayſe, fauour, and reſpect with
men, and can haue no quiet longer then their worldly fauour la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth,
and that they will haue what diſhonour ſoeuer come to God,
or diſgrace vnto men, yea, they will diſgrace, reproch, and diſdaine
others, to gaine honour and aduancement to themſelues, yea, they
will make bold with the Scriptures and word of God, to wreſt and
wring, and ſlight it ouer for their credits ſake. And let a man marke
ſome mens talke, ſtories, diſcourſes, &amp;c. and he ſhall ſee their whole
drift is to extoll and ſet out themſelues, and get praiſe and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of men.</p>
            <p>Now the contrary was ſeene in <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 2.</note> he ſayth, <hi>He needed no letters
of commendations.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 12.</note> And againe, <hi>He is not affected with mens prayſe;</hi>
and here is indeed the difference betweene an humble minded
Chriſtian, and a proud ſelfe-louer; an humble man often hath
prayſe,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 18. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> as <hi>Dauid, Hezekiah,</hi> and <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> but he ſeekes it not, he deſires
it not,<note place="margin">2 King. 18. 3.</note> he is content to goe without it, he loues not the prayſe of
men, for he knowes it is but froth and vanitie: But a proud ſelfe-lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
he ſeekes it ſtill, get it or not get it, and if he get it he is fully
ſatisfied, if he get it not he hangs the head like a Bull-ruſh, and hath
no comfort.</p>
            <p>The fift way by which men ſeeke their owne, is by ſeeking to haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
their wils,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 8.</note> as the wrong doers in <hi>Corinth,</hi> who thought it not enough
to doe wrong and harme to their brethren, but to haue their wills
enough of them, drew them before the Heathen Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>And truely, ſome men are ſo Prince-like, or rather Papall, that
their very will and word is become a law, and if they haue ſaid it,
it muſt be ſo, els there is no reſt nor quietneſſe to be had, let neuer
ſo many reaſons be brought to the contrary, its but fighting with
the winde. They are like the obſtinate <hi>Iewes,</hi> who, when againſt
Gods law &amp; reaſon,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 8. 19.</note> they had asked a King, though <hi>Samuel</hi> ſhewed
them that it would turne in the end to their owne ſmart, yet ſtill
held the concluſion, and ſayd, nay, <hi>But we will haue a King.</hi>
Thus men are caught by their owne words, and inſnared by the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:22594:9"/>
ſtraitnes of their owne hearts, and it is death to them not to haue
their wils,<note place="margin">1 King. 19. 2.</note> and howſoeuer ſometimes (like <hi>Iezabell)</hi> they are cut
ſhort of their purpoſes, yet ſelfe-willed men will ſtrout and ſwell
like <hi>Abſolon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 13. 22.</note> ſaying neither <hi>good nor bad,</hi> but hope for the day, and
threaten like prophane <hi>Eſall:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 27. 41.</note> Now the contrary is ſeene in <hi>Dauid,</hi>
though a Prince, a Captaine, a Warriour, who hauing ſayd, yea,
ſworne, that he would kill <hi>Naball,</hi> and all his family that day, yet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
reaſonable counſell giuen,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25. 34.</note> and that but by a weake woman, he
changed his minde, altered his purpoſe, and returned, without
ſtriking one ſtroake, an example rare, and worthy imitation; and
when men are ſicke of will, let them thinke of <hi>Dauid,</hi> it was his
grace and honour to goe backe from his word and practiſe, when
reaſon came;<note place="margin">Math. 14. 8. 9.</note> So was it <hi>Herods</hi> diſgrace and ſhame to hold his word
and will againſt reaſon and conſcience.</p>
            <p>But ſome man happily will ſay vnto me,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> It is true, that men ſeeke
their owne by all theſe wayes, But what ſhould be the reaſon and
cauſe of this? that men ſeeke ſo earneſtly themſelues, in ſeeking ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
honour, eaſe, belly-cheare, will, &amp;c. ſomething there is that
carrieth them.</p>
            <p>True, and the reaſons and cauſes are ſpecially theſe three;</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Reſp.</note> pride and high conceitednes, when men ouer-value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues:
And this made <hi>Abſolon</hi> to ſeeke his Fathers kingdome,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he thought himſelfe worthy of it.:<note place="margin">2 Sam. 15. 4.</note> This made <hi>Haman</hi> ſo ſore
vexed,<note place="margin">Heſt. 3. 5.</note> becauſe <hi>Mordecai</hi> bowed not to him, becauſe he highly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
himſelfe.</p>
            <p>And ſurely, that which a man valueth at much, he giueth much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to, and ſo it is a ſure ſigne that a man loues himſelfe moſt
when he giueth moſt to himſelfe, and ſome intollerable proud per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
euen thinke all the world is for them, and all their purpoſes
and endeuours ſhew what a large conceit they haue of themſelues.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> want of due conſideration and valuation of other
mens endowments, abilities, and deſerts, when men paſſe thoſe
things by,<note place="margin">Gen. 40. 23.</note> though they haue both ſeene, heard, and felt them, as
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> Butler forgat <hi>Ioſephs</hi> eminency when he was reſtored to his
place, ſo men vſe to write their owne good actions in Braſſe, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens in Aſhes, neuer remembring nor conſidering the paynes,
labour, good properties, &amp;c. which others haue, and ſo they haue
no loue to them, but onely to themſelues; as if God had made all
other men vnreaſonable Beaſts, and them onely reaſonable men.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note> want of a heauenly conuerſation, and ſpirituall eye to
behold the glory, greatneſſe, and maieſtie, and goodneſſe of God,
as the Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> thought highly of her own glory, wiſedome,
and happineſſe,<note place="margin">1 King. 10. 7. 8</note> till ſhe ſaw <hi>Salomons</hi> wiſedome and glory, and then
ſhe cryed out, not of the happineſſe of her owne ſeruants, but of his
ſeruants that ſtood before him; and verily, if men were conuerſant
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:22594:9"/>
Courtiers in heauen,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 33.</note> they would cry out with <hi>Paul, Oh the deepneſſe
of the riches, wiſedome, and knowledge of God, &amp;c.</hi> and would be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of their owne ſinfulneſſe,<note place="margin">Similies.</note> nakedneſſe, and miſery; for, as coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
men which neuer ſaw the ſtate of Cities, nor the glory of courts,
admire euen their owne countrey orders: And as the Sauages here
which are clad in skinnes, and creepe in woods and holes, thinke
their owne brutiſh and inhumane life the beſt, which if they ſaw and
did rightly apprehend the benefit of comely humanity, the ſweetnes
of Religion, and the ſeruice of God, they would euen ſhamefully
hide themſelues from the eye of all noble Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Euen ſo, if men in ſerious contemplation, by the eye of faith,
would behold the glory of God, and what great riches, beautie,
fulneſſe, perfection, power, dignitie, and greatneſſe is in God, they
would leaue admiring of themſelues, and ſeeking of themſelues, and
would ſay with <hi>Dauid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 7. 18.</note> 
               <hi>What am I? And what is my Fathers houſe?
that thou ſhouldeſt thus bleſſe me?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 8. 3.</note> Yea, <hi>What is man? or the ſonne of
man that thou ſo regardeſt him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is time that we now come to apply theſe things more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
to our ſelues, and ſee what vſe is to be made of them.</p>
            <p>Is it ſo that God ſeeth a proannes in all the ſonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> to
ſeeke themſelues too much, and hath giuen them warnings and
watch words thereof, as we haue heard, and doth experience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
it? Then hence are reproued a number of men, who thinke
they can neuer ſhew loue enough to themſelues, nor ſeeke their own
enough, but thinke all coſt, charges, cheeriſhing, prayſe, honour, &amp;c.
too little for them,<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 22.</note> and no man needeth ſay to them, as <hi>Peter</hi> did to
Chriſt, <hi>fauour thy ſelfe,</hi> but if they doe a little for another man, they
account it a great matter, though it be but a morſell of bread, or a
ſingle penny; but no varieties of dainties is too good for them, no
ſilke, purple, cloth, or ſtuffe is too good to cloth them, the poore
mans idleneſſe and ill huſbandry is oft throwne in his diſh, but their
owne carnall delights and fleſhly wantonneſſe is neuer thought vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and why? Becauſe they thinke euen God and man owes all to
them, but they owe nothing to none. Why, thou fooliſh and beſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
man, hath not the holy Ghoſt read it in the face of euery ſonne
of <hi>Adam,</hi> that he is too apt to ſeeke his owne, and art thou wiſer
then God, to thinke thou neuer ſeekeſt thine owne enough? or
dreameſt thou that thou art made of other, and better mettall then
other men are? Surely, I know no way to eſcape, hauing of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to thy Father, and the worme to thy ſiſter and brother. And if
God had any where in all the Scriptures ſayd, loue thy ſelfe, make
much of thy ſelfe, prouide for one, &amp;c. there were ſome reaſon for
thee to take vp the Nigards Prouerbs, <hi>Euery man for himſelfe, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:22594:10"/>
God for vs all; Charitie beginneth at home, &amp;c.</hi> But God neuer taught
thee theſe things; No, they are Sathans poſitions: Doth God euer
commend a man for carnall loue of himſelfe?<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 14.</note> Nay, he brands it, and
diſgraceth it,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 4.</note> as <hi>ſelfe-loue; taking thought for the fleſh; louing of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a point of good naturall policie,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> for a man to care and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
for himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Then the moſt fooles haue moſt naturall policie,<note place="margin">Reſp.</note> for ſee you not
the greateſt droanes and nouices, either in Church, or Common-wealth,
to be the greateſt ſcratchers,<note place="margin">Pſal. 73. 5. 7.</note> and ſcrapers, and gatherers of
riches? Are they not alſo, for the moſt part, beſt fed and clad? and
liue they not moſt eaſily? What ſhall I ſay? Euen hoggs, doggs, and
bruit Beaſts know their own eaſe, and can ſeeke that which is good
for themſelues; And what doth this ſhifting, progging, and fat feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which ſome vſe, more reſemble any thing then the faſhion of
hoggs? and ſo let it be what naturall policie it will.</p>
            <p>If God ſee this diſeaſe of ſelfe-loue ſo dangerous in vs,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> then it
ſtandeth vs all in hand to ſuſpect our ſelues, and ſo to ſeeke out the
roote of this diſeaſe, that it may be cured. If a learned Phyſitian,
ſhall ſee by our countenance and eye,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that we haue ſome dangerous
diſeaſe growing on vs, our hearts will ſmite vs, and we will bethinke
our ſelues, where the moſt griefe lieth, and how it ſhould come,
whether with cold, heate, ſurfeit, ouer-flowing of bloud, or thorow
griefe, melancholy, or any ſuch way, and euery man will beſtirre
himſelfe to get rid of it, and will preuent all wayes that feed the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
and cheriſh all courſes that would deſtroy it.</p>
            <p>Now, how much more ought we to beſtirre our ſelues, for this
matter of ſelfe-loue, ſince God himſelfe hath caſt all our waters,
and felt all our pulſes, and pronounced vs all dangerouſly ſicke of
this diſeaſe? beleeue it, God cannot lie, nor be deceiued; He that
made the heart, doth not he know it? Let euery mans heart ſmite
him, and let him fall to examination of himſelfe, and ſee firſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he loue not riches and worldly wealth too much, whether his
heart be not too iocand at the comming of it in, and too heauie at
the going of it out, for if you find it ſo, there is great danger; if thou
canſt not buy as if thou poſſeſſedſt not,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 30. 31.</note> and vſe this world as thou
vſedſt it not, thou art ſicke and haddeſt need to looke to it. So, if
thou loueſt thine eaſe and pleaſure,<note place="margin">Iob 2. 10.</note> ſee whether thou canſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to receiue at Gods hands euill as well as good; whether thou
haue learned as well to abound as to want,<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 10.</note> as well to endure hard
labour, as to liue at eaſe; and art as willing to goe to the houſe of
mourning as to the houſe of mirth;<note place="margin">Edele 7. 6.</note> for, els, out of doubt, thou loueſt
thy carnall pleaſure and eaſe too much.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:22594:10"/>
Againe,<note place="margin">Dan. 1. 15.</note> ſee whether thine heart cannot be as merry, and thy mind
as ioyfull, and thy countenance as cheerefull, with courſe fare, with
poulſe, with bread and water (if God offer thee no better, nor the
times afford other) as if thou hadſt great dainties: So alſo whether
thou canſt be content as well with the ſcornes of men, when thou
haſt done well, as with their prayſes, ſo if thou canſt with comfort
and good conſcience ſay,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 3.</note> I paſſe little for mans iudgement, whether
thou canſt doe thy duety that God requireth,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 2.</note> and deſpiſe the ſhame,
referring thy ſelfe vnto God, for if thou be diſhartned, diſcouraged,
and weakened in any duety becauſe of mens diſprayſes, its a ſigne
thou loueſt thy ſelfe too much.</p>
            <p>So for the will,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25. 34.</note> if thou canſt be content to giue way euen from
that which thou haſt ſayd ſhalbe, yea vowed ſhalbe, when better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

cheerefull in thine heart,<note place="margin">1 King. 21. 4.</note> though thy will be croſſed, it is a good ſigne,
but if not, thou art ſicke of a ſelfe will, and muſt purge it out. I the
rather preſſe theſe things, becauſe I ſee many men both wiſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
which yet are ſo tainted with this peſtilent ſelfe-loue,<note place="margin">Eccle. 10. 1.</note> as that

            <p>It is reported,<note place="margin">A faire warning.</note> that there are many men gone to that other Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

many cauſes of it, this ſelfe-loue is not the leaſt; It is indeede a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Nay, you muſt ſeeke ſtill the wealth of one another; And enquire
as <hi>Dauid,</hi> how liueth ſuch a man? How is he clad? How is he fed?
He is my brother, my aſſociate; we ventered our liues together here,
and had a hard brunt of it, and we are in league together, is his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
harder then mine? ſurely, I will eaſe him; hath he no bed to
lie on? why, I haue two, Ile lend him one; hath he no apparel? why,
I haue two ſuits, Ile giue him one of them; eates he courſe fare,
bread and water, and I haue better? why, ſurely we will part ſtakes:
He is as good a man as I, and we are bound each to other, ſo that his

the onely maker and conſeruer of Churches and common-wealths,

As firſt, to maintaine modeſtie in all our aſſociates, that of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie
wanters they become not bold beggers and impudent crauers,
for as one ſayth of women, that, when they haue loſt their ſhamefaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
they haue loſt halfe their honeſtie, ſo may it truely be ſayd of
a man, that when he hath loſt his modeſtie, and puts on a begging
face, he hath loſt his maieſtie, and the Image of that noble creature,
and man ſhould not begge and craue of man but onely of God; true
it is,<note place="margin">Iohn 4. 5.</note> that as Chriſt was faine to craue water of the Samaritan wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
ſo men are forced to aske ſometimes rather then ſtarue, but
indeede in all ſocieties it ſhould be offered them, men often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
of mens boldnes in asking, but how commeth this to paſſe,
but becauſe the world hath beene ſo full of ſelfe-louers, as no man
would offer their money, meate, garmentes, though they ſaw
men hungrie, harborleſſe, poore, and naked in the ſtreetes; and
what is it that makes men brazen faced, bold, bruitiſh, tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
mutinous, but becauſe they are pinched with want, and ſee
others of their Companions (which it may be haue leſſe deſerued)
to liue in proſperitie and pleaſure?</p>
               <p>It wonderfully encourageth men in their dueties,<note place="margin">2 Reaſon.</note> when they
ſee the burthen equally borne; but when ſome withdraw themſelues
and retire to their owne particular eaſe, pleaſure, or profit; what
heart can men haue to goe on in their buſineſſe? when men are come
together, to lift ſome weighty peece of tymber or veſſell; if one
ſtand ſtill and doe not lift, ſhall not the reſt be weakned and diſhart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?
will not a few idle droanes ſpoyle the whole ſtocke of labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Bees: ſo one idle belly, one murmurer, one complainer, one
ſelfe-louer will weaken and diſharten a whole Colonie. Great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
haue beene brought to paſſe, where men haue cheerefully as
with one heart, hand, and ſhoulder, gone about it both in warres,
buildings, and plantations, but where euery man ſeekes himſelfe, all
commeth to nothing.</p>
               <p>The preſent neceſſitie requireth it,<note place="margin">3 Reaſon.</note> as it did in the dayes of the

                  <note place="margin">Neh. 5.</note> returning from captiuitie, and as it was here in <hi>Corinth.</hi> The
Countrey is yet raw, the land vntilled, the Cities not builded, the
Cattell not ſetled, we are compaſſed about with a helpleſſe and idle
people, the natiues of the Countrey, which cannot in any comely
or comfortable manner helpe themſelues, much leſſe vs. Wee alſo
haue beene very chargeable to many of our louing friends, which
helped vs hither, and now againe ſupplyed vs, ſo that before we
thinke of gathering riches,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 30. 26. 31.</note> we muſt euen in Conſcience thinke of
requiting their charge, loue, and labour, and curſed be that profit
and gaine which aymeth not at this. Beſides, how many of our deare
friends, did here die at our firſt entrance, many of them no doubt
for want of good lodging, ſhelter, and comfortable things, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:22594:12"/>
more may goe after them quickly, if care be not taken. Is this
then a time for men to begin to ſeeke themſelues?<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth, that
men in the laſt dayes ſhall be louers of themſelues, but it is here yet
but the firſt dayes, and (as it were) the dawning of this new world,
it is now therefore no time for men to looke to get riches, braue
clothes, daintie fare, but to looke to preſent neceſſities; it is now
no time to pamper the fleſh, liue at eaſe, ſnatch, catch, ſcrape, and
pill, and hoord vp, but rather to open the doores, the cheſts, and
veſſels, and ſay, brother, neighbour, friend, what want yee, any
thing that I haue? make bold with it, it is yours to command, to doe
you good, to comfort and cheeriſh you, and glad I am that I haue
it for you.</p>
               <p>And euen the example of God himſelfe,<note place="margin">4 Reaſon.</note> whom we ſhould follow
in all things within our power and capacitie,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 1.</note> may teach vs this leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
for (with reuerence to his Maieſtie be it ſpoken) he might
haue kept all grace,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 16.</note> goodneſſe, and glory to himſelfe, but he hath
communicated it to vs,<note place="margin">Pſal. 113. 6. 7.</note> euen as farre as we are capable of it in this
life,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 5.</note> and will communicate his glory in all fulneſſe with his Elect

the world to come. If God then haue delighted in this doing good
and relieuing frayle and miſerable man, ſo farre inferior to himſelfe,
what delight ought man to haue to relieue and comfort man, which

is thorow Gods iuſt iudgement recompenced vpon the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

               <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">6 Reaſon.</note> that we may draw to an end; A mercileſſe man, and a
man without naturall affection or loue, is reckoned among ſuch
as are giuen ouer of God to a reprobate minde,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 30.</note> and (as it were)
tranſformed into a beaſt-like humor; for, what is a man if he be not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:22594:13"/>
ſociable, kinde, affable, free hearted, liberall; He is a beaſt in the
ſhape of a man; or rather an infernall Spirit, walking amongſt
men which makes the world a hell what in him lieth; for, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
a hell to liue where there are many ſuch men: ſuch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
calleth <hi>Nabals,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 14. 1.</note> which ſignifieth <hi>fooles</hi> and decayed men, which
haue loſt both the ſap of grace and nature; and ſuch merciles men

                  <note place="margin">Math. 25. 33.</note> and ſhall be ſet at Chriſts left hand at the laſt day;
<hi>Oh therefore ſeeke the wealth one of another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſome will ſay,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> it is true, and it were well, if men would ſo doe,
but we ſee euery man is ſo for himſelfe, as that if I ſhould not doe
ſo, I ſhould doe full ill, for if I haue it not of my owne, I may ſnap
ſhort ſometimes, for I ſee no body ſheweth me any kindneſſe, nor
giueth me any thing; if I haue gold and ſiluer, that goeth for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and if I want it, I may lie in the ſtreete, therefore I were beſt
keepe that I haue, and not be ſo liberall as you would haue me, except
I ſaw others would be ſo towards me.</p>
               <p>This Obiection ſeemeth but equall and reaſonable, as did the
Anſwere of <hi>Naball</hi> to <hi>Dauids</hi> men,<note place="margin">Reſp.</note> but it is moſt fooliſh and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
as his alſo was; for, if we ſhould meaſure our courſes by
moſt mens practiſes, a man ſhould neuer doe any godly dutie;
for,<note place="margin">Luk. 13. 23. 24.</note> doe not the moſt, yea, almoſt all, goe the broad way that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to death and damnation? who then will follow a multitude?
It is the word of God, and the examples of the beſt men that we
muſt follow. And what if others will doe nothing for thee, but
are vnkinde, and vnmercifull to thee? Knoweſt thou not that they
which will be the children of God muſt be kinde to the vnkinde,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 44. 47.</note>
louing to their enemies, and bleſſe thoſe that curſe them? If all
men were kinde to thee, it were but <hi>Publicans</hi> right eouſneſſe to be
kinde to them; If all men be euill, wilt thou be ſo too? When
<hi>Dauid</hi> cryed out; <hi>Helpe Lord, for not a godly man is left.</hi> Did he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
turne vngodly alſo?<note place="margin">Pſal. 12. 1.</note> Nay, he was rather the more ſtrict: So,
if loue and charitie be departed out of this world, be thou one of
them that ſhall firſt bring it in againe.<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 20.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And let this be the firſt rule, which I will with two others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
for this time.</p>
               <p>Neuer meaſure thy courſe by the moſt,<note place="margin">1 Rule.</note> but by the beſt, yea, and
principally by Gods word; Looke not what others doe to thee,
but conſider what thou art to doe to them; ſeeke to pleaſe God, not
thy ſelfe: did they in <hi>Mathew</hi> 25. 44. plead, that others did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for them? No ſuch matter, no ſuch plea will ſtand before
God, his word is plaine to the contrary, therefore, though all
the world ſhould neglect thee, diſregard thee, and contemne
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:22594:13"/>
thee, yet remember thou haſt not to doe with men, but with the
higheſt God, and ſo thou muſt doe thy dutie to them notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
               <p>And let there be no Prodigall perſon to come forth and ſay,<note place="margin">2 Rule.</note>
Giue me the portion of lands and goods that appert<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ineth to me,<note place="margin">Luk. 15. 12.</note>
and let me ſhift for my ſelfe; It is you too ſoone to put men to their
ſhi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts; <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſeauen yoares in <hi>Canaan,</hi> before the land was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
vnto Tribes, much longer, before it was deuided vnto Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies:
And why wouldeſt thou haue thy particular portion, but
becauſe thou thinkeſt to liue better then thy neighbour, and ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
to liue ſo meanely as he? but who, I pray thee, brought this
particularizing firſt into the world?<note place="margin">Eſay 14. 12. 13</note> Did not Sathan, who was
not content to keepe that equall ſtate with his fellowes,<note place="margin">Iude 6.</note> but would
ſet his throne aboue the Starres?<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 5.</note> Did not he alſo entiſe man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
his generall felicitie and happineſſe, and goe trie particular
knowledge of good and euill? And nothing in this world doth more
reſemble heauenly happineſſe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 133. 1.</note> then for men to liue as one, being of
one heart,<note place="margin">Act. 4. 32.</note> and one ſoule; neither any thing more reſembles hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
horror, then for euery man to ſhift for himſelfe; for if it be a
good minde and practiſe, thus to affect particulars, <hi>mine</hi> and
<hi>thine,</hi> then it ſhould be beſt alſo for God to prouide one heauen for
thee, and another for thy neighbour.</p>
               <p>But ſome will ſay,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> if all men would doe their endeuour as I
doe, I could be content with this generalitie, but many are idle and
ſloathful, and eate vp others labours, and therefore it is beſt to part,
and then euery man may doe his pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Reſp.</note> This, indeed, is the common plea of ſuch as will endure
no inconueniences, and ſo for the hardneſſe of mens hearts,
God and man doth often giue way to that which is not beſt,<note place="margin">Math. 19. 8.</note> nor
perpetuall,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 8. 5.</note> but indeede if wee take this courſe, to change ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
and practiſes, becauſe of inconueniences, wee ſhall haue,
euery day, new lawes.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 3. 9.</note> If others be idle, and thou diligent, thy fellowſhip,
prouocation, and example may well helpe to cure that maladie in
them, being together, but being aſunder, ſhall they not be more
idle, and ſhall not <hi>Gentrie</hi> and <hi>Beggerie</hi> be quickly the glorious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes
of your Common-wealth?</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 29.</note> Conſtrue things in the beſt part, be not too haſtie to
ſay,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 30. 10. 24.</note> men are idle and ſlouthfull, all men haue not ſtrength, ſkill, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie,
ſpirit, and courage to worke alike; it is thy glory and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:22594:14"/>
that canſt doe ſo well, and his ſhame and reproach, that
can doe no better; and are not theſe ſufficient rewards to you
both?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if any be idle apparantly, you haue a Law and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours
to execute the ſame, and to follow that rule of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,<note place="margin">Act. 19. 38.</note>
to keepe backe their bread, and let them not eate, goe not
therefore whiſperingly,<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 3. 10.</note> to charge men with idleneſſe; but goe to
the Gouernour and proue them idle; and thou ſhalt ſee them haue
their deſerts.<note place="margin">Deut. 19. 15.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And as you are a body together, ſo hang not together by ſkins
and gymocks, but labour to be ioynted together and knit by fleſh
and ſynewes; away with enuie at the good of others, and reioyce
in his good,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 18. 9.</note> and ſorrow for his euill, let his ioy bee thy ioy, and
his ſorrow thy ſorrow:<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 19.</note> let his ſickneſſe be thy ſickneſſe: his hunger

be friends in aduerſities: for then a friend is knowne, and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and not before.</p>
               <p>Lay away all thought of former thinges and forget them,<note place="margin">3 Rule.</note> and
thinke vpon the things that are,<note place="margin">Gen. 42. 1.</note> looke not gapingly one vpon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
