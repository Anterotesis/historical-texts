            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

So in a kingdome or common wealth, which maye by <note place="margin">A comparison betweene a mans body and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth.</note> comparison very well be resembled to a mans body, there often chaunceth very sore and doubtfull sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, which growe in tyme to such forcible and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame occasions: as they not onely daunger the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing of the most part, but in conclusion worke the vtter ruine and destruction of the whole. Yet when the body is offended by sicknesse, the freendes of the diseased party do dilligently enquire after Phisitions:
<pb facs="tcp:13261:5"/>
then what medicines his Arte can deuise, or what wholsome potions good councell can minister, are presently prepared for ease of his vexation.</p>
            <p>In like manner, in any common wealth, that is thus touched with any disease that foresheweth peryll: <note place="margin">All men are bound in duetie to defend their Countrie.</note> euery one that is faithfully affected to the same, or imploy theyr liues (as they ought) for the benefite thereof, are bound with heedfull care to seeke reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for such malladies, yea, it is a principall article of theyr duety, to let slip no occasion that may be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged helpfull in such a case.

            <p>The excellent Historiographer <hi>Herodotus</hi> sheweth <note place="margin">Herodotus in his Booke called Clio, which is the first Booke of his Story.</note> vs a notable example, how the <hi>Babilonians</hi> made this lawe amongst them, that when so euer any man fell sicke within their dominions, he should presently be brought into the market place, &amp; there be laid on his bed: to the intent that he might demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of euery one that came to him, whether they had beene troubled with the lyke disease or no, and by what means they recouered theyr health, that he might by knowledge

And by the same lawe lykewise, euery man that came to him was bound, both to aske the man what sicknesse he had: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to shew him (if it lay in him to doo it) what might soonest delyuer him from that state. By which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, euery one that beareth a true &amp; faithful zeale to his Countrie, and earnestly tendereth the health and wealth thereof: when so euer he seeth the body thereof (which lyeth open before all mens eyes) to be infected or touched with any infirmitie, and can eyther by experience or otherwise delyuer, what in his conceit may be imagined auayleable: he is bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in conscience to expresse it, and great is the penaltie if he conceale it. For in helping the whole body, he hath benefite therof himselfe, in that he is a member <note place="margin">The whole hody being out of qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, the members must needes fare the wurse.</note> thereof: for let the body be sicke, the members must needes be partakers of the greefe, and at what tyme it findeth health againe, the members lykewise haue comfort by the releefe.

through the Cittie honourablie into the Tower, out of <note place="margin">The young King and his Brother brought to the Tower.</note> the which after that day they neuer came abroade.

               <p>In bréefe, the Protectour taketh vpon him to be King, <note place="margin">The Protector crowned King, by the name of King Richard the third.</note> and so preuailed that he was crowned King: but when he remembred that his two Nephewes were liuing in the Tower, and one of them the right King in déede, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded himselfe (as verie well he might) that men would account him to haue no right to the Realme, therefore he thought to dispatch them out of the way, as though the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his kinsemen could amend his cause, &amp; make him a kindlie King.

When King <hi>Richard</hi> perceyued he could not preuaile that way, he brake the matter to Sir <hi>Iames Tirrell,</hi> whome he found verie tractable to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, wherefore he sent him on the morrowe with a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Sir <hi>Robert Brakenburie,</hi> by which Letter he was commaunded to delyuer to Sir <hi>Iames</hi> all the keies of the Tower for one night, to the ende he might there accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish the Kinges pleasure, in such thinges as he had giuen him commaundement.

               <p>The Prince so soone as the Protectour had lefte that name, and tooke vpon himselfe to be King, was thereof in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed, <note place="margin">The young Prince informed that his Vnckle would be King, and his aunswere to the same.</note> that he should not reigne, but his Unckle would haue the Crowne.

                  <hi>Blacke Will,</hi> or <hi>Willam Slaughter</hi> excepted, who was set to serue them and sée them sure. After which time, the Prince neuer tied his pointes, nor did any thing of himself, but with the young babe his Brother lingred in thought and heauines, till this traiterous death deliuered them out of that wretched estate.

               <p>Then all the other being remooued from them, this <hi>Myles Forrest</hi> and <hi>Iohn Dighton,</hi> about midnight (the sielie Children lying in their beddes) came into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and suddenlie lapped them vp amongst the cloathes: and they had so bewrapped them and intangled them, kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping downe by force the fetherbed and pillowes harde vnto their mouthes, that within a while, smoothered and stifled, their breath failing them, they gaue vp to God their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent <note place="margin">The young King and his Brother murdered.</note> soules into the ioies of Heauen, leauing to the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors their bodies dead in the bedde. Which after that the cruell wretches perceiued, first by strugling with the paines of death, and after long lying still to be throughlie dead, they laide their bodies naked vpon the bedde, and fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Sir <hi>Iames</hi> to sée them: who vpon the sight of them,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:13261:20"/>
caused those murderers to burie them at the staire foote, méetlie déepe in the ground, vnder a great heape of stones. Then rode Sir <hi>Iames</hi> in great haste to King <hi>Richard,</hi> and <note place="margin">King Richard thanketh Syr Iames for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> shewed him all the manner of the murder, who gaue him great thankes, and (as some say) there made him Knight: but he allowed not their burying in so vile a corner, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he would haue them buried in a better place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were a Kinges sonnes. Upon this, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, a Priest belonging to Sir <hi>Robert Brakenburie,</hi> tooke vp the bodies againe, and secretlie enterred them in such a place, as by the occasion of his death, who onelie knew it, could neuer since come to light. Uerie troth it is, and well knowne, that at such time as Sir <hi>Iames Tirrell</hi> was in the Tower, for treason committed against the most famous Prince King <hi>Henrie</hi> the seuenth, both <hi>Dighton</hi> and he were examined, and they confessed the murder in manner aboue written, but whether the bodies were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued they could nothing tell.</p>
               <p>And thus were these two noble Princes, these innocent tender children, borne of a most royall blood, brought vp in great wealth, likelie long to liue, reigne and rule in the Realme, shortlie shut vp in prison, and priuilie thus mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, their bodies cast God knowes where, by the cruell ambition of their vnnaturall Unckle, and his despightfull tormentors. Which thinges on euerie part well ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, God neuer gaue this Realme a more notable example, neither in what vncertainty standeth this worldlie weale, or what mischéefe worketh the proude enterprises of an high heart, or finallie, what wretched end ensueth such vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall <note place="margin">Myles Forrest rotted in peeces to death.</note> crueltie.

torne and tugged like a curre Dogge. In his life time, by credible report of such as were secrete with his Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, after this abhominable déede was doone, he neuer was quiet in his minde: he neuer thought himselfe sure, where he went abroade, he still priuilie looked about him, his body was secretly fenced, his hand euer vpon his Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, his countenaunce and manners like one alwaies rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to strike againe, sore wearied with care and watch, he rather slumbred then slept, troubled with fearful dreames, suddenlie sometime he sterted vp, leapt out of his bed, and ran about the Chamber, so was his restlesse heart continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie tossed and tumbled, with the tedious impression and stormie remembraunce of his abhominable déede. A no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table example doublesse, to all such as take like enterprise in hand, that cannot be contented to liue within compasse of duetie, but their aspiring thoughts must stretch furder, then either their habillitie will serue them, or God suffer them. The seate of a Prince is a place of great Maiesty, and none but such as GOD hath appointed, can containe themselues in that Royall roome: then if they wilfullie couet that place, for which both reason and duetie sayth, they are farre vnfit, such is the iustice of him, by whome Kinges rule, and Princes swaie their Soueraigntie, as the pleasure they thought to haue in that high Office, is a verie dagger to their hearts, and such an eating woorme to their consciences, as by this example before you maye plainlie perceiue. Let Princes therefore be honoured and feared as they ought, and let Subiectes liue in true and faithfull obedience to them, because it is a chéefe and an especiall article of their duetie.</p>

In which storie we haue first to consider, in what extreme miserie, sicknesse, feare and perill her Highnesse was: into what care, what trouble of minde, and what <note place="margin">The troubles of Lady Elizabeth in Queene Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries tyme.</note> daunger of death she was brought. First with great routes &amp; bands of Armed men (and happy was he that might haue the carrying of her) being fetcht vp as the greatest traitour in the world, clapt in the Tower, and againe tossed from thence, from house to house, from prison to prison, from post to piller, at length also prisoner in her owne house, and garded with a sort of cutthroates, which euer gaped for the spoile, whereby they might be fingering on somewhat.</p>

In which storie, if I should set foorth at large and at full, all the particulers and circumstaunces therevnto belonging, and as iust occasion of the historie requireth, besides the importunate length of the storie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed: peraduenture it might mooue offence to some being yet aliue, and trueth might gette me hatred. Yet notwithstanding, I intend (by the grace of Christe) therein to vse such breuitie and moderation, as both may be to the glorie of God, the discharge of the storie, the profite of the Reader, and hurt to none, suppressing the names of some, whome héere although I could receite, yet I thought not to
<pb facs="tcp:13261:26"/>
be more cruell in hurting their name, then the Quéene hath béene mercifull in pardoning their liues.</p>
               <p>Therefore now to enter into the discourse of this tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call matter, first héere is to be noted, that Quéene <hi>Marie</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The historie of Lady Elizabeth.</note> when she was first Quéen, before she was crowned, would goe no whether, but would haue her by the hand, and send for her to dinner and supper: but after she was crowned, she neuer dined nor supped with her, but kept her aloofe from her, &amp;c. After this it happened, immediatly vpon the rising of Sir <hi>Thomas Wiat,</hi> that the Ladie <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and the Lord <hi>Courtney,</hi> were charged with false suspition of Sir <hi>Thomas Wiats</hi> rising. Wherevpon Quéene <hi>Marie,</hi> whether for that surmise, or for what other cause I knowe not, being offended with the Ladie <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her Sister, at that time lying in her house at <hi>Ashridge,</hi> the next daye after the rising of <hi>Wiat,</hi> sent to her thrée of her Counsay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, to wit, Sir <hi>Richard Southwell,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings,</hi> then Maister of the Horse, and Sir <hi>Thomas Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walles,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Sir Richard Southwell. Sir Edward Hastin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and Sir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Cornwalles sent to fetch vp Lady Elizabeth.</note> with their retinue and troupe of Horsemen, to the number of two hundred and fiftie. Who at their suddaine and vnprouided comming, found her at the same time sore sicke in her bedde, and verie weake &amp; féeble of body. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when they came, ascending vp to her Graces priuie Chamber, they willed one of her Ladies, whome they met, to declare vnto her Grace, that there were certaine come from the Court, which had a message from the Quéene. Her Grace hauing knowledge thereof, was right glad of their comming: howbeit being then verie sicke, and the night farre spent (which was at ten of the clock) she reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted them by the messenger, that they would resort thither in the morning. To this they aunswered, and by the same messenger sent word againe, that they must néedes sée her, &amp; would so doo, in what case so euer she were. Wherat the <note place="margin">The vnmanner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse of the Knights.</note> Lady being agast, went to shew her Grace their wordes: but they hastilie following her, came rushing as soone as she into her Graces chamber, vnbidden. At whose so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den comming into her chamber, her Grace being not a litle
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:13261:26"/>
amazed, saide vnto them: Is the haste such, that it might not haue pleased you to come to morrowe in the morning? They made answer, that they were right sorie to sée her in that case. And I (quoth she) am not glad to sée you héere at this time of the night. Whervnto they answered, that they came from the Quéene to doo their message &amp; duety: which was to this effect, that the Quéenes pleasure was, that she should be at <hi>London</hi> the seuenth day of that present month. Wherevnto she saide: Certes, no creature more glad then I to come to her Maiestie, being right sorie that I am not in case at this time to waite on her, as you your selues doo sée, and can well testifie. In déed we sée it true (quoth they) that you doo say, for which we are verie sorie. Albeit we let <note place="margin">A straite Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from the Queen, to bring the Lady Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth either quick or dead.</note> you vnderstand, that our Commission is such, and so stray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vs, that we must néedes bring you with vs, either quicke or dead. Whereat she being amazed, sorrowfullie saide, that their Commission was verie sore: but yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding she hoped it to be otherwise, &amp; not so straite. Yes verelie said they. Whervpon they called for two Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, Doctor <hi>Owen</hi> and Doctor <hi>Wendie,</hi> and demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of them, whether she might be remooued from thence with life, or no. Whose aunswer and iudgement was, that there was no impediment to their iudgement, to the contrarie, but that she might trauaile without daunger of life. In conclusion, they willed her to prepare against the morning, <note place="margin">The gentlenesse of Queene Marie to send her horse Lytter to bring her Sister to trouble.</note> at nine of the clocke to goe with them, declaring that they had brought with them the Quéenes Litter for her. After much talke, the messengers declaring how there was no prolonging of times and daies, so departed to their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, being entertained and chéered as appertained to their worshippes. On the next morrowe at the time prescribed, they had her foorth as she was, verie faint and féeble, and in such case, that she was ready to swound thrée or foure times betwéene them. What should I speake héere that cannot well be expressed? What an heauie house there was, to behold the vnreuerent and dolefull dealing of these men, but especially the carefull feare and captiuity of their
<pb facs="tcp:13261:27"/>
innocent Ladie and Mistresse.</p>
               <p>Now to procéede in her iourney from <hi>Ashridge,</hi> all sicke in a Litter, she came to <hi>Redborne,</hi> where she was garded <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeth taketh her iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney toward the Queene.</note> all night. From thence to S. <hi>Albones,</hi> to Sir <hi>Ralphe Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets</hi> house, where she taried that night, both féeble in body, and comfortles in minde. From that place they passed to Maister <hi>Doddes</hi> house at <hi>Mymmes,</hi> where also they remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that night: and so from thence she came to <hi>Highgate,</hi> where she being verie sicke, taried that night and the next day. During which time of her abode there, came many Pursuiuants &amp; Messengers from the Court: but for what purpose I cannot tell. From that place she was conueied to the Court, where by the way came to méete her many Gentlemen, to accompany her Highnesse, which were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie sorie to sée her in that case: but especiallie a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeth brought vp to London.</note> of people there were standing by the way, who then flocking about her Litter, lamented and bewailed greatlie her estate. Now when she came to the Court, her Grace was there straite waies shut vp, and kept as close prisoner a fortnight, which was till Palme Sundaie, séeing neither King nor Quéene, nor Lord nor fréend all that time, but onelie then the Lord Chamberlaine, Sir <hi>Iohn Gage,</hi> &amp; the Uicechamberlaine, who were attendaunt vnto the doores. About which time Sir <hi>William Sentlowe</hi> was called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Councel, to whose charge was laide, that he knew of <hi>Wiats</hi> rebellion. Which he stoutlie denied, protesting <note place="margin">Sir William Sentlowe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Tower.</note> that he was a true man both to God and his Prince, defy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Traitours and Rebelles: but being straitly exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he was in conclusion committed to the Tower.</p>
               <p>The Friday before Palme Sunday, the Bishoppe of <hi>Winchester,</hi> with ninetéene other of the Councel, who shall be héere namelesse, came vnto her Grace from the Quéens <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeth charged with Sir Thomas Wiats conspiracie.</note> Maiesty, and burdened her with <hi>Wiats</hi> conspiracie: which she vtterlie denied, affirming that she was altogether guiltlesse therein. They being not contented with this, <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeth charged with the busines of Sir Peter Carew.</note> charged her Grace with businesse made by Sir <hi>Peter Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rew,</hi> and the rest of the Gentlemen of the West countrey:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:13261:27"/>
which she also vtterly denying, cleared her innocencie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. In conclusion, after long debating of matters, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto her, that was the Quéenes will and pleasure <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeth threatned to goe to the Tower,</note> that she should go vnto the Tower, while the matter were furder tried and examined. Whereat she being agast, said. That she trusted the Quéens Maiesty would be more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Lady vnto her, and that her Highnesse would not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise conceiue of her, but that she was a true woman: declaring furthermore to the Lords, that she was innocent <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeth purgeth her selfe to the Lordes.</note> in all those matters wherewith they had burdened her, and desired them therefore to be a furder meane to the Quéene her Sister, that she being a true woman in thought, worde and déede towardes her Maiestie, might not be committed to so notorious &amp; dolefull a place, protesting that she would request no mercie at her hand, if she should be prooued to haue consented vnto any such kinde of matter, as they had laide vnto her charge. And therefore in fine, desired their Lordshippes to thinke of her what she was, and that she might not so extremelie be dealt withall for her trueth. Wherevnto the Lordes aunswered againe, that there was no remedie, for that the Quéenes Maiestie was fullie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, that she should goe vnto the Tower: wherwith the Lordes departed with their cappes hanging ouer their eyes. But not long after, within the space of an howre or more, came fowre of the foresaide Lords of the Councell, which were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord Treasurer, the Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> the Lord Steward, &amp; the Earle of <hi>Sussex,</hi> with the Garde, who warding the next Chamber to her, secluded all her Gentlemen and Yeomen, Ladies and Gentlewomen: sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeths seruaunts remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from her.</note> that for one Gentlemen Usher, thrée Gentlewomen, and two Groomes of her Chamber, were appointed thrée other men of the Quéenes, and thrée waiting Women, to <note place="margin">The Queenes men and women attendaunt vppon the Lady Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</note> giue attendance vpon her, that none should haue accesse to her Grace. At which time, there was an hundred of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Soldiours in white coates, watching and warding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Gardens all that night, a great fire being made in the middest of the Hall, and two certaine Lordes wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb facs="tcp:13261:28"/>
there also, with their band and company.</p>
               <p>Upon Saturday following, two Lords of the Counsaile, (the one was the Earle of <hi>Sussex,</hi> the other shalbe name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse) came and certified her Grace, that foorthwith she must goe vnto the Tower, the Barge being prepared for her, and the tide now ready, which tarieth for no body. In heauie moode her Grace requested the Lordes, that she might tarie one other tide, trusting that the next would be better and more comfortable: but one of the Lordes repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that neither tide nor time was to be delaied. And when her Grace requested him, that she might be suffered to write to the Quéenes Maiestie: he answered that he durst <note place="margin">The hard dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a certaine Lord with the Lady Elizabeth.</note> not permitte that, adding, that in his iudgement, it would rather hurt then profite her Grace in so dooing. But the other Lord more courteous and fauourable (who was the <note place="margin">The Earle of Sussex gentle to the Lady Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</note> Earle of <hi>Sussex)</hi> knéeling downe, tolde her Grace that she should haue libertie to write, and as he was a true man he would deliuer it to the Quéenes Highnesse, and bring an aunswere of the same, whatsoeuer came thereof. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon she wrote: albeit she could in no case be suffered to <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeth writeth to the Queene, but it would not serue.</note> speake with the Quéene, to her great discomfort, being no offender against the Quéenes Maiestie. And thus the time and tide passed away for that season, they priuilie appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting al things ready, that she should go the next tide, which fell about midnight: but for feare she should be taken by the waie, they durst not. So they staied tyll the next day, being Palme Sunday, when about nine of the clocke these two returned againe, declaring that it was time for her Grace to depart: She aunswering, if there be no remedy, I must be content, willing the Lords to goe on before. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come foorth into the garden, she did cast vp her eies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the windowe, thinking to haue séene the Quéene, which she could not. Whereat she saide: She meruailed much what the Nobilitie of the Realme meant, which in that sort would suffer her to be ledde into captiuitie, the Lord knewe whether, for she did not? In the meane time commaundement was giuen in all <hi>London,</hi> that euery one
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:13261:28"/>
should kéepe the Church, and carie their Palmes, while (in the meane season) she might be conueied without all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of people into the Tower. After all this, she tooke her Barge with the foresaide Lordes, thrée of the Quéenes <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeth sent to the Tower.</note> Gentlewomen, and thrée of her owne, her Gentleman Usher, and two of her Groomes, lying and houering vpon the water a certaine space, for that they could not shoot the Bridge, the Barge men being verie vnwilling to shoot the same so soone as they did, because of the daunger thereof: for the sterne of the Barge strooke vpon the ground, the fall was so bigge, and the water was so shallowe, that the Barge being vnder the bridge, there staied againe a while. At landing, she first staied, &amp; denied to land at those staires, where all traitours and offendors customablie vse to land, neither well could she, vnlesse she would goe ouer her shooes. The Lordes were gone out of the Barge before, and asked why she came not? One of the Lordes went back againe to her, and brought word she would not come. Then saide one of the Lordes, which shalbe namelesse, that she should not chuse, and because it rained, he offered to her his cloake, which she (putting it backe with her hand with a good dashe) refused. So she comming out, hauing one foot vpon the staire, saide: Héere landeth as true a Subiect (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prisoner) as euer landed at these staires, and before thée <note place="margin">The wordes of Lady Elizabeth entring the Tower.</note> O God I speake it, hauing no other fréends but thée alone. To whome the same Lord aunswered againe, that if it were so, it was the better for her. At her landing, there was a great multitude of their seruaunts and Warders standing in their order. What néeded all this (saide she.) It is the vse (saide some) so to be, when any prisoner came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And if it be for my cause (saide she) I beséech you that they may be dismissed. Whereat the poore men knéeled downe, and with one voice desired GOD to preserue her Grace: but the next day they were (therefore) released of their olde coates. After this, passing a little furder, she sate downe vpon a colde stone, and there rested her selfe. To whom the Lieuetenant then being, said: Madame, you
<pb facs="tcp:13261:29"/>
were best to come out of the raine, for you sit vnholsomely. She then replying, aunswered againe: Better sitting héere then in a wurse place, for God knoweth, I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you will bring me. With that her gentleman Usher wept, she demaunding of him what he meant, to vse her so vncomfortablie, séeing she tooke him to be her comforter, and not to dismay her, especiallie for that she knewe her trueth to be such, that no man should haue cause to wéepe for her: but foorth she went into the prison. The doores were locked and bolted vpon her, which did not a little dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort and dismay her Grace, at what time she called to her gentlewoman for her Booke. Desiring God not to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <note place="margin">The christian prayer of Lady Elizabeth.</note> her to build her foundation vpon the sandes, but vpon the rocke, whereby all blastes of blustring weather should haue no power against her. The doores being thus locked, and she close shut vp, the Lordes had great conference how to kéepe warde and watch, euerie man declaring his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in that behalfe, agréeing straitlie and circumspectlie to kéepe her. Then one of them, which was the Lord of <note place="margin">The Lord of Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex speaketh for Lady Elizabeth.</note> 
                  <hi>Sussex,</hi> swearing, saide: My Lordes let vs take héede, and doo no more then our Commission will beare vs, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer shall happen héereafter. And further, let vs consider that she was the King our Maisters Daughter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs vse such dealing, that we may aunswere vnto it heereafter, if it shall so happen, for iust dealing (quoth he) is alwaies aunswerable. Wherevnto the other Lordes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greede that it was well saide of him, and therevpon depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Being in the Tower, within two daies commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement was, that she should haue Masse within her house: one Maister <hi>Young</hi> was then her Chaplaine, and because there was none of her men so well learned, to helpe the Priest to saye Masse, the Masse staied for that day. The next day two of her Yeomen, who had gone long to schoole before, and were learned, had two Abcies prouided and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered them, so that vpon the Abcies they should helpe the Priest. One of the saide Yeomen, holding the Abcie in his hand, pretending ignoraunce at <hi>Kirieleyson,</hi> set the Priest,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:13261:29"/>
making as though he could aunswer no furder.</p>
               <p>It would make a pittifull and a straunge storie, héere by the way to touch and recite, what examinations and rac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinges of poore men there were, to finde out that knife that should cut her throat: what gaping among my Lords of the Clergie, to sée the day when they might wash their goodlie white Rochets in her innocent blood. But especiallie the Bishop of <hi>Winchester Stephen Gardiner,</hi> then Lord Chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, <note place="margin">The Bishop of Winchester eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to Lady Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth.</note> ruler of the roste, who then within fewe dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came vnto her, with diuers other of the Councell, and examined her of the talke that was at <hi>Ashridge,</hi> betwixt her and Sir <hi>Iames Acroft,</hi> concerning her remoouing from thence to <hi>Dunnington</hi> Castell, requiring her to declare what she meant thereby? At the first, she being so sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie asked, did not wel remember any such house: but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a while, well aduising her selfe, she said. In deede (quoth she) I doo now remember that I haue such a Place, but I neuer lay in it in all my life: and as for any that hath moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me therevnto, I doo not remember. Then to enforce <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeth examined by the Bishop of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester.</note> the matter, they brought foorth Sir <hi>Iames Acroft:</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Winchester</hi> demaunded of her, what she saide to that man? She aunswered, that she had little to say to him, or to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rest that were then prisoners in the Tower. But my Lords (quoth she) you doo examine euerie meane prisoner of me, wherein me thinkes you doo me great iniurie. If they haue doone euill, &amp; offended the Quéenes Maiestie, let them aunswer to it accordingly: I beseech you my Lords, ioine not me in this sort with any of these offendours. And as concerning my going to <hi>Dunnington</hi> Castell, I doo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that Maister <hi>Hobby</hi> and mine Officers, and you Sir <hi>Iames Acroft</hi> had such talke: but what is that to she purpose (my Lords) but that I may go to mine owne hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses at all times? The Lord of <hi>Arundel</hi> knéeling downe, <note place="margin">The freendlie speech of the Earle of Arundel to Lady Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</note> saide: Your Grace sayth true, and certainlie we are verie sorie, that we haue so troubled you about so vaine matters. She then saide: My Lords, you doo sift me verie narowly, but well I am assured, you shall doo no more to me then
<pb facs="tcp:13261:30"/>
God hath appointed, and so God forgiue you all. At their departure, Sir <hi>Iames Acroft</hi> knéeled downe, declaring that he was verie sorie to sée the daye, in which he should be brought as a witnesse against her Grace. But I assure your Grace (said he) I haue béene meruailouslie tossed and <note place="margin">Sir Iames Acroft examined tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Lady Elizabeth.</note> examined touching your Highnesse, which the Lord kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth is very straunge to me. For I take God to record be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all your Honours, I doo not knowe any thing of that crime that you haue laide to my charge, and will thervpon take my death, if I should be driuen to so straite a triall.</p>
               <p>That day or there about, diuers of her owne Officers, <note place="margin">These were not the Officers of the Tower, but such as went in white &amp; greene.</note> who had made prouision for her diet, brought the same to the vtter gate of the Tower, the common rasall soldiours receiuing it: which was no small gréefe to the gentlemen, the bringers therof, wherfore they required to speake with the Lord Chamberlaine, being then Constable of the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. Who, comming before his presence, declared vnto his Lordship, that they were much afraid to bring her Graces diet, and deliuer it to such common &amp; desperate persons, as they were which did receiue it: beséeching his Honour to consider her Grace, and to giue such order, that her viands might at all times be brought in by them, which were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed therevnto. Yea Sirs (saide he) who appointed you this office? They aunswered, her Graces Councel. Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel (quoth he?) There is none of them whith hath to doo, <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeths seruaunts restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging her diet to the Tower.</note> either in that case, or any els within this place: and I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure you, for that she is a prisoner, she shalbe serued with the Lieuetenaunts men, as other prisoners are. Whereat the gentlemen saide, that they trusted for more fauour at his hands, considering her personage, saying: that they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strusted <note place="margin">Displeasure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Lord Chamberlaine. and the Lady Elizabeths men.</note> not, but that the Queene &amp; her Councell would be better to her Grace then so, and therewith shewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be offended, at the vngratefull words of the Lord Chamberlaine, towards their Lady and Mistresse. At this he swore by God, striking himselfe vpon the breast, that if they did either frowne or shrug at him, he would set them where they should sée neither Sunne nor Moone. Thus ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:13261:30"/>
their leaue, they desired God to bring him into a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter minde towards her Grace, and departed from him. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occasion whereof, her Graces Officers made great sute vnto the Queenes Councell, that some might be appointed to bring her diet vnto her, and that it might no more be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered vnto the common soldiours of the Tower. Which being reasonablie considered, was by them graunted, and therevppon were appointed one of her Gentlemen her Clerke of her Kitchin, and her two Purueiours to bring in her prouision once a day: all which was doone, the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders euer waiting vpon the bringers thereof. The Lord Chamberlaine himselfe being alwaies with them, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectlie and narrowlie watched and searched what they brought, &amp; gaue héede that they should haue no talke with any of her Graces waiting seruaunts, and so warded them both in and out. At the saide sute of her Officers, were sent by the commaundement of the Councell, to waite vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon her Grace, two Yeomen of her Chamber, one of her <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeths wayting men in the Tower.</note> Robes, two of her Pantrie and Ewrie, one of her Buttry, an other of her Seller, two of her Kitchin, and one of her Larder, all which continued with her the time of her trouble.</p>
               <p>Heere the Constable, being at the first not verie well pleased, with the comming in of such a company against his will, would haue had his men to haue serued still with her Graces men: which her seruaunts at no hand would suffer, desiring his Lordship to be contented, for that order was taken, that no stranger should come within their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. At which aunswer being sore displeased, he brake out into these threatning words: Well (saide he) I wil handle ye well enough. Then went he into the Kitchin, and there would néedes haue his meat rosted with her Graces meat, <note place="margin">Variaunce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Lord Chamberlaine &amp; Lady Elizabeths seruaunts.</note> and saide that his Cooke should come thither and dresse it. To that her Graces Cooke aunswered: My Lord, I will neuer suffer any straunger to come about her diet, but her owne sworne men so long as I liue. He saide, they should: But the Cooke saide, his Lordshippe should pardon him for
<pb facs="tcp:13261:31"/>
that matter. Thus did he trouble her poore seruaunts very stoutlie: though afterwardes he were otherwise aduised, &amp; they more courteouslie vsed at his hands. And good cause why, for he had good chéere, &amp; fared of the best, &amp; her Grace paid wel for it: wherfore he vsed himselfe afterward more reuerentlie toward her Grace. After this sort, hauing béen a whole moneth there in close prison, and being verie euill at ease therewithall: she sent for the Lord Chamberlaine and the Lord <hi>Shandoyes,</hi> to come &amp; speake with her. Who comming, she requested of them, that she might haue liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to walke in some place, for that she felt her selfe not well. To the which they aunswered, that they were right sory that they could not satisfie her Graces request, for that <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeth denied the lyber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Tower.</note> they had commaundement to the contrarie, which they durst not in any wise breake. Furthermore, she desired of them, if that could not be graunted, that she might walke but into the Quéenes lodging. No nor yet that (they aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered) could by any meanes be obtained, without a furder sute to the Quéene and her Councell. Well (saide she) my Lordes, if the matter be so hard, that they must be sued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to for so small a thing, and that fréendshippe be so straite: God comfort me, and so they departed, she remaining in her olde dungeon still, without any kinde of comfort, but onelie God.</p>
               <p>The next day after, the Lord <hi>Shandoyes</hi> came againe vnto her Grace, declaring vnto her that he had sued vnto the Councell for furder libertie. Some of them consented thervnto, diuers other dissented, for that there were so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prisoners in the Tower. But in conclusion, they did all agrée, that her Grace might walke into those lodginges, so that he &amp; the Lord Chamberlaine, and thrée of the Quéenes gentlewomen did accompany her, the windowes being shutte, and she not suffred to looke out at any of them: wherewith she contented her selfe, and gaue him thankes for his good will in that behalfe. Afterwardes there was <note place="margin">Lybertie graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Lady Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth to walke in a garden.</note> libertie graunted to her Grace to walke in a little garden, the doores and gates being shutte vp: which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:13261:31"/>
was as much discomfort vnto her, as the walke in the garden was pleasant and acceptable. At which times of her walking there, the prisoners on that side were straightlie commaunded, not to speake or looke out at the windowes into the garden, till her Grace were gone out againe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing (in consideration therof) their kéepers waiting vppon them for that time. Thus her Grace with this small liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie contented her selfe in God, to whome be praise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>During this time, there vsed a little boie, a mans childe in the Tower, to resort to their chambers, and many times to bring her Grace flowers, which likewise he did to the other prisoners that were there. Wherevpon naughtie and suspicious heads, thinking to make &amp; wring out some <note place="margin">Suspicious heads.</note> matter thereof, called on a time the childe vnto them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising him Figges and Apples, and asking of him when he had béene with the Earle of Deuonshiere, not ignorant of the childes wunted frequenting vnto him. The boye aunswered, that he would goe by and by thether. Further, <note place="margin">A young childe examined for bringing flowers to Lady Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</note> they demaunded of him, when he was with the Lady <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabethes</hi> Grace. He aunswered: euerie day. Furthermore they demaunded of him, What the Lord of Deuonshiere sent by him to her Grace. The childe said, I will goe know what he will giue me to carrie to her. Such was the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the child, being yet but foure yéeres of age. This same is a craftie boie (quoth the Lord Chamberlaine) How say you my Lord <hi>Shandoyes?</hi> I praie you my Lord (quoth the boie) giue me the Figges you promised me. No marie (quoth he) thou shalt be wipped, if thou come any more to the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> or to the Lord <hi>Courtney.</hi> The boie aunswered: I will bring my Lady my Mistresse more flowers. Whervpon the childes father was commaunded, to permitte the boie no more to come vp into their cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. The next day as her Grace was walking in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, the childe péeping in at a little hole in the doore, cried vnto her, saying: Mistresse, I can bring you no more flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers. Whereat she smiled, but saide nothing, vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:13261:32"/>
thereby what they had doone. Wherefore, afterwards the L. Chamberlaine rebuked highlie his Father, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to put him out of the house. Alas poore Infaunt, (quoth the Father.) It is a craftie knaue (quoth the Lord Chamberlaine:) but let me sée him héere no more.</p>
               <p>The fift day of Maie, the Constable was discharged of <note place="margin">The Constable of the Tower discharged of his Office, and Sir Henrie Benifield with his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany placed about the Lady Elizabeth.</note> his Office of the Tower, and one Sir <hi>Henrie Benifield</hi> placed in his roome, a man vnknowne to her Grace, and therefore the more feared: which so sudden mutation was vnto her no little amaze. He brought with him an hundred Soldiours in blew coates, wherewith she was meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louslie discomforted, and demaunded of such as were about her, whether the Ladie <hi>Ianes</hi> Scaffold were taken away or <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeth both in great feare and doubt of her lyfe.</note> no, fearing by reason of their comming, least she should haue plaied her part. To whome aunswere was made, that the Scaffold was taken away, and that her Grace née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not to doubt of any such tirannie: for God would not suffer any such treason against her person. Wherewith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contented, but not altogether satisfied, she asked what Sir <hi>Henrie Benifield</hi> was? And whether he were of the <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeth in doubt of Sir Henry Benifield.</note> conscience or no, that if her murdering were secretlie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his charge, he would sée the execution thereof. She was aunswered, that they were ignorant what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of man he was: howbeit they perswaded her, that God would not suffer such wickednesse to procéede. Well (quoth she) God graunt it be so: for thou O God canst mollifie all <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeths prayer.</note> such tirannous hearts, and disappoint all such cruell purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. And I beséech thée to heare me thy creature, which am thy seruaunt and at thy commaundement, trusting by thy grace euer so to remaine. About which time it was spread abroade, that her Grace should be carried from thence, by this new iollie Captaine and his Soldiours, but whether, it could not be learned: which was vnto her a great gréefe, especiallie for that such a companie was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to her garde, requesting rather to continue there still, then to be led thence with such a sort of rascalles. At last plaine aunswere was made by the Lord <hi>Shandoyes,</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:13261:32"/>
that there was no remedie, but from thence she must néeds depart to the Manour of <hi>Woodstocke,</hi> as he thought. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demaunded of her, for what cause: for that (quoth he) the Tower is like further to be furnished. She being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous to know what he meant thereby, demaunded, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: with such matter as the Quéene and the Councell were determined in that behalfe, wherof he had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and so departed. In conclusion, on Trinitie Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, being the ninetéene day of Maie, she was remooued from the Tower, the Lord Treasurer being then there for the lading of her Cartes, and discharging the place of the same: where Sir <hi>Henrie Benifield</hi> (being appointed her Gaoler) did receiue her with a company of rakehelles to garde her, beside the Lord of <hi>Darbyes</hi> band, wafting in the Countrie about for the Moone-shine in the water. Unto <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeth remooueth from the Tower to Woodstocke.</note> whome at length came my Lord of <hi>Tame,</hi> ioyned in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission with the saide Sir <hi>Henrie,</hi> for the safe guiding of her to prison: and they together conueied her Grace to <hi>Woodstocke,</hi> as héereafter followeth.</p>
               <p>The first day they conducted her to <hi>Richmond,</hi> where she <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeth secluded from her seruaunts.</note> continued all night, being restrained of her owne men, which were lodged in out Chambers, and Sir <hi>Henrie Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieldes</hi> Soldiours appointed in their roomes, to giue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendaunce on her personne. Whereat she being meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louslie dismaied, thinking verilie some secrete mischéefe to <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeth in dispayre of her selfe.</note> be working towardes her: called her Gentleman Usher, and desired him with the rest of his company, to pray for her, for this night (quoth she) I thinke to die. Wherewith he being stricken to the heart, saide: God forbid that any such wickednesse should be pretended against your Grace. So comforting her as well as he could, at last he burst into teares, &amp; went from her downe into the Court, wher were walking the Lord of <hi>Tame</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Benefield.</hi> Then he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to the Lord of <hi>Tame</hi> (who had proffered to him much fréendshippe) desired to speake with him a word or two: vnto whom he familiarlie said, he should with all his heart. Which when Sir <hi>Henrie</hi> (standing by) heard, he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb facs="tcp:13261:33"/>
what the matter was? To whome the Gentleman Usher aunswered: No great matter Sir (saide he) but to speake with my Lord a woord or two. Then when the Lord of <hi>Tame</hi> came to him, he spake on this wise. My Lord (quoth he) you haue béene alwaies my good Lord, and so I <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeths Vsher talketh with the Lord of Tame.</note> beséech you to remaine. The cause why I come to you at this time, is to desire your Honour, fréendlie to declare to me, whether any daunger is meant to my Mistresse this night, or no, that I and my poore fellowes may take such part as shall please God to appoint: for certainlie we will rather die, then she should secretlie and innocentlie misca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Marie (saide the Lord of <hi>Tame)</hi> God forbidde that any <note place="margin">The gentle heart of the Lord of Tame to Lady Elizabeth.</note> such wicked purpose should be wrought: and rather then it should be so, I with my men are ready to die at her foote also. And so (praised be God) they passed that dolefull night with no little heauinesse of heart.</p>
               <p>Afterward, passing ouer the water at <hi>Richmond,</hi> going to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>VVindsor,</hi> her Grace espied certaine of her poore ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding on the other side, which were verie desirous to sée her. Whome when she behelde, turning to one of her men standing by, she saide: Yonder I sée certaine of my men, goe to them, and say these wordes from me: <hi>Tanquam ouis.</hi> So she passing forward to <hi>VVindsore,</hi> was lodged <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tanquam ouis.</hi> Like a sheepe to to the slaughter.</note> there that night in the Deane of <hi>VVindsores</hi> house: a place in déede more méet for a Priest then a Princesse. And from thence her Grace was garded and brought the next night to Maister <hi>Dormers</hi> house, where much people standing <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeth honourablie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the people</note> by the waie, some presented to her one gift, and some an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so that Sir <hi>Henrie</hi> was greatlie mooued therewith, and troubled the poore people verie sore, for shewing their louing hearts in such a manner, calling them Rebels and Traitours, with such like vile wordes. Beside, as he passed through the Uillages, the Townsemen rang the Belles, as being ioyfull of her comming, thinking verilie it had béene otherwise then it was in déede, as the sequell prooued after to the said poore men. For immediatlie the said Sir <hi>Henrie</hi> hearing the same, sent his Soldiours thether, who appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:13261:33"/>
some of the Ringers, setting them in the stockes, and otherwise vncourteouslie misusing othersome for their good willes. On the next morrowe her Grace passing from <note place="margin">The gentle en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement of Lady Elizabeth, at the Lord of Tames house.</note> Maister <hi>Dormers</hi> (where for the time of her abode there, was a straite watche kept) came to the Lord of <hi>Tames</hi> house, where she laie all that night, being verie Princelie entertained, both of Knightes and Ladies, gentlemen and gentlewomen. Whereat Sir <hi>Henrie Benifield</hi> grunted, and was highlie offended, saying vnto them: That they <note place="margin">Sir Henrie Beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field grudged at the gentle enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement of Lady Elizabeth. The rude and vngentle behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of Sir Henrie Benifield.</note> could not tel what they did, and were not able to aunswer their dooinges in that behalfe. Letting them to vnderstand, that she was the Quéenes Maiesties prisoner, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise: aduising them therefore to take héede, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of afterclappes. Wherevnto the Lord of <hi>Tame</hi> aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered on this wise: That he was well aduised of his doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges, being ioyned in Commission as well as he, adding with warrant, that her Grace might &amp; should in his house be merie. The next day, as she should take her iorney from <hi>Kichmond</hi> toward <hi>VVoodstocke,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Tame</hi> with an other Gentleman being at the Tables, playing and drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vye Crownes, the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> passing by, staied and saide, she would sée the game plaide out, which Sir <hi>Henrie Benifield</hi> would scarce permit. The game running long about, and they playing drop vye Crownes: Come on (sayth he.) I will tarie (sayth she) and will sée this game out. After this Sir <hi>Henrie</hi> went vp into a Chamber, where was appointed for her Grace a Chayre, two Cushi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and a foote Carpet, very faire and Princelike: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in presumptuouslie he sate, and called one <hi>Barwicke</hi> his man to pull off his Bootes. Which as soone as it was knowne among the Ladies and Gentles, euerie one mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed thereat, and laughed him to scorne, obseruing his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discrete manners in that behalfe, as they might verie wel. When Supper was doon, he called my Lord, &amp; willed him that all the Ladies and gentlemen should withdraw them selues euerie one to his lodging: meruailing much that he would permit there such a company, considering so great a
<pb facs="tcp:13261:34"/>
charge committed to him. Sir <hi>Henry</hi> (quoth my Lord) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent your selfe, all shall be voided, your men and all. Nay, my Soldiours (quoth Sir <hi>Henrie)</hi> shall watch all night. The Lord of <hi>Tame</hi> aunswered: it shall not néede. Well (saide he) néede or néede not, they shall so doo: mistrusting belike the company, which God knoweth was without cause.</p>
               <p>The next daie her Grace tooke her iourney from thence <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeth, commeth to Woodstocke.</note> to <hi>Woodstocke,</hi> where she was inclosed, as before in the Tower of <hi>London:</hi> the Soldiours garding and warding both within and without the walles, euery day to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thrée score, and in the night without the walles for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, during the time of her imprisonment there. At length, <note place="margin">The strait watch kept at Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocke.</note> she had gardens appointed for her to walke in, which was verie comfortable to her Grace: but alwaies when she did recreate her selfe therein, the doores were fast locked vp, and in as straite manner as they were in the Tower, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at least fiue or six lockes betwéene her lodging and her walkes, Sir <hi>Henrie</hi> himself kéeping the keies, and trusting no man therewith. Wherevpon she called him her Gaoler: and he knéeling downe, desired her Grace not to call him so, for he was appointed there to be one of her Officers. From such Officers (quoth she) good Lord deliuer me.</p>
               <p>And now by the way as digressing, or rather refreshing the Reader, if it be lawfull in so serious a storie to recite a <note place="margin">A merie storie concerning the straite keeping of the Lady Elizabeth.</note> matter incident, and yet not impertinent to the same, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion héere mooueth, or rather enforceth me, to touch bréef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie what happened in the same place and time by a merie conceited man, being then about her Grace. Who noting the straite and straunge kéeping of his Lady &amp; Mistresse by the said Sir <hi>Henrie Benifield,</hi> with so many locks &amp; doores, with such watch and warde about her, as was strange and wunderful: espied a Goate in the warde where her Grace was, and whether to refreshe her oppressed minde, or to notifie her straite handling by Sir <hi>Henrie,</hi> either els both, he tooke it vppon his necke, and followed her Grace there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, as she was going into her lodging. Which when she
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:13261:34"/>
sawe, she asked him what he would doo with it, willing to let it alone. Unto whome the same partie aunswered: No by saint <hi>Marie</hi> (if it like your Grace) will I not, for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell whether he be one of the Quéenes fréendes or no, I will carrie him to Sir <hi>Henrie Benifield</hi> (God willing) to knowe what he is. So leauing her Grace, he went with the Goate on his necke, and carried it to Sir <hi>Henrie Beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field:</hi> who when he sawe him comming with it, asked him halfe angerlie what he had there? Unto whome the partie <note place="margin">The straitnesse of Sir Henrie Beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field merily no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> aunswered, saying: Sir (quoth he) I cannot tell what he is, I praie you examine him, for I found him in the place where my Ladies Grace was walking, &amp; what talke they haue had I cannot tell, for I vnderstand him not, but he should séeme to me to be some straunger, and I thinke ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie a Welch man, for he hath a white fréese coate on his backe. And for so much as I being the Quéenes subiect, and perceiuing the straite charge committed to you of her kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, that no straunger should haue accesse vnto her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sufficient licence: I haue héere found a stranger (what he is I cannot tell) in place where her Grace was wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and therfore for the necessarie discharge of my duety, I thought it good to bring the saide straunger to you, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine as you sée cause: and so he let him downe. At which wordes Sir <hi>Henrie</hi> séemed much displeased, and saide: Well, well, you will neuer leaue this géere I sée, and so they departed.</p>
               <p>Now to returne to the matter from whence we haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed, <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeth, with much adoo, suffered to write to the Queene.</note> after her Grace had béene there a time, she made sute to the Councell, that she might be suffered to write to the Quéene: which at last was permitted. So that Sir <hi>Henrie</hi> brought her pen, inke and paper, and standing by her while she wrote (which he straitlie obserued) alwayes she being wearie, he would carrie away her Letters, and bring them againe when she called for them. In the fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing therof, he would haue béen messenger to the Quéene of the same, whose request her Grace denied, saying: One of her owne men should carrie them, and that she would
<pb facs="tcp:13261:35"/>
neither trust him, nor none of his therein. Then he aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering againe, saide: None of them durst be so bolde (he trowed) to carie her Letters, being in that case. Yes (quoth she) I am assured I haue none so dishonest, that would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie my request in that behalfe, but will be as willing to serue me now, as before. Well (saide he) my Commission <note place="margin">The cruell dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Sir Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Benifield to the Lady Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, reproued.</note> is to the contrarie, and I may not so suffer it. Her Grace replying againe, saide: You charge me verie often with your Commission, I praye God you may iustlie aunswere the cruell dealing you vse towardes me. Then he knéeling downe, desired her Grace to thinke and consider, how he was a seruaunt, and put in trust by the Quéene to serue her Maiestie: protesting that if the case were hers, he would as willinglie serue her Grace, as nowe he did the Quéenes highnesse. For the which his aunswer, her Grace thanked him, desiring of God, that she might neuer haue néede of such seruauntes as he was: declaring further to him, that his dooinges towards her were not good nor aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable, but more then all the fréends he had would stand by. To whome Sir <hi>Henrie</hi> replied and saide: That there was no remedie but his dooinges must be aunswered, and so they should, trusting to make good account thereof. The cause which mooued her Grace so to saye, was, for that he would not permitte her Letters to be carried foure or fiue daies after the writing therof. But in fine, he was content <note place="margin">The Letters of Lady Elizabeth carried to the Queene.</note> to send for her gentleman from the Towne of <hi>Woodstocke,</hi> demaunding of him, whether he durst enterprise the carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of her Graces Letters to the Quéene, or no: and he aunswered, yea Sir that I dare, and wil with all my hart. Wherevpon Sir <hi>Henrie</hi> (halfe against his stomacke) tooke them vnto him. Then about the eight day of Iune, came downe Doctour <hi>Owen</hi> and Doctour <hi>Wendie,</hi> sent by the <note place="margin">Doctor Owen &amp; Doctor Wendie, Queene Maries Phisitions sent to Lady Elizabeth.</note> Quéene to her Grace, for that she was sicklie: who mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string to her, and letting her blood, tarried there and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on her Grace fiue or sixe dayes. Then she being well amended, they returned againe to the Court, making their good report to the Quéene and the Councell, of her Graces
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:13261:35"/>
behauiour and humblenesse towardes the Quéenes High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Which her Maiestie hearing, tooke verie thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: but the Bishoppes therat repined, looked blacke in the <note place="margin">The popish Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates repined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lady Elizabeth.</note> mouth, and tolde the Quéene, they meruailed that she sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted not her selfe to her Maiesties mercie, considering that she had offended her Highnesse. About this time, her Grace was requested by a secrete fréend, to submit her self <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeth requested to submit her selfe to the Queene.</note> to the Quéenes Maiestie, which would be very well taken, and to her Grace great quiet and commodity: vnto whom she aunswered: That she would neuer submitte her selfe to them whome she neuer offended. For (quoth she) if I haue offended and am guiltie, I then craue no mercie but the lawe: which I am certaine (quoth she) I should haue had ere this, if it could be prooued by me. For I knowe my selfe (I thanke God) to be out of the daunger thereof, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing that I were as cléere out of the perill of mine eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: and then I am assured, I should not be so locked and bolted vp within walles &amp; doores, as I am, God giue them a better minde when it pleaseth him.</p>
               <p>About this time, was there a great consulting among <note place="margin">Councell of the Papists, to marie the Lady Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth to a Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard.</note> the Bishoppes and gentlemen, touching a mariage for her Grace, which some of the <hi>Spaniardes</hi> wished to be with some Stranger, that she might go out of the Realme with her portion: some saying one thing, and some an other. A Lord (who shall be heere namelesse) being there, at last <note place="margin">Wicked councell giuen against Lady Elizabeth.</note> saide: That the King should neuer haue any quiet Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth in <hi>England,</hi> vnlesse her head were stricken from her shoulders. Wherevnto the <hi>Spaniardes</hi> aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, saying: God forbid that the King their Maister should haue that minde, to consent to such a mischéefe. This was the courteous aunswere of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to the <hi>Englishe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Spaniardes more fauourable to Lady Elizabeth, then some Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish men.</note> 
                  <hi>men,</hi> speaking after that sort against their owne Country. From that day the <hi>Spaniardes</hi> neuer left off their good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions to the King, that the like honour he should neuer obtaine, as he should in deliuering Lady <hi>Elizabethes</hi> Grace out of prison: whereby at length she was happilie released from the same. Héere is a plaine and euident ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<pb facs="tcp:13261:36"/>
of the good clemencie and nature of the King and his Councellers towardes her Grace, praised be God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, who mooued their heartes therein. Then héerevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, she was sent for shortlie after, to come to <hi>Hampton Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before her remoouing from <hi>VVoodstocke,</hi> we will a little stay, to declare in what dangers her life was, during this time she there remained. First thorowe fire, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to kindle betwéene the boordes and seeling, vnder the <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeth, in daunger of fyre.</note> Chamber where she laie: whether by a sparke of fire got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into a creuis, or whether of purpose by some that meant her no good, the Lord dooth knowe. Neuerthelesse, a woorshipfull Knight of Oxfordshiere, which was there ioyned the same time with Sir <hi>Henrie Benifield,</hi> in kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that Lady (who then tooke vp the boordes and quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the fire) verilie supposed it to be doon of purpose. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore it is thought, and also affirmed (if it be true) of one <hi>Paule Peny</hi> a kéeper of <hi>VVoodstocke,</hi> a notorious <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeth, in daunger of kylling.</note> Ruffian, and a butcherlie wretch, that was appointed to kill the Lady <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> who both sawe the man, being often in her sight, and also knewe thereof. An other time one of the priuie Chamber, a great man about the Quéene, <note place="margin">An other conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie of murder against Lady Elizabeth.</note> and chéefe darling of <hi>Stephen Gardiner,</hi> named Maister <hi>Iames Basset,</hi> came to <hi>Blandenbridge</hi> a mile from <hi>UUood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocke,</hi> with twentie or thirtie priuie coates, and sent for Sir <hi>Henrie Benifield</hi> to come and speake with him. But as God would, who disposed all thinges after the purpose of his owne will, so it happened, that a little before, the saide Sir <hi>Henrie Benifield</hi> was sent for by a Poste to the Councell, leauing straite worde behinde him with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that no man whatsoeuer he were, though comming with a Bill of the Quéenes hand, or any other warrant, should haue accesse to her before his returne againe. By reason whereof so it fell out, that Sir <hi>Henrie Benifieldes</hi> brother comming to him at the Bridge, would suffer him in no case to approch in: who otherwise (as it is supposed) was appointed violentlie to murder the innocent Lady.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:13261:36"/>
At what time likewise that the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was in <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeth preserued by the Lordes proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, from exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution in the Tower.</note> the Tower, a Writ came downe subscribed with certaine handes of the Councell, for her execution: which if it were certaine as it is reported, <hi>Winchester</hi> (do doubt) was deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser of that mischeuous drift. And doubtlesse the same <hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophell</hi> had brought his impious purpose that day to passe, had not the fatherlie prouidence of Almightie God (who is alwaies stronger then the deuill) styrred vp Maister <hi>Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> Lieuetenaunt the same time of the Tower, to come in haste to the Quéene, to giue certificate therof, and to know further her consent for her Sisters death. Wherevppon it followed, that all that deuise was disappointed, and <hi>VVin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesters</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Winchesters platforme ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne.</note> deuillishe platforme (which he saide he had cast through the Lordes goodnesse) came to no effect. Where moreouer is to be noted, that during the imprisonment of this Lady and Princesse, one Maister <hi>Edmund Tremaine</hi> was on the Racke, and Maister <hi>Smithwike,</hi> and diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Tower were examined, and diuers offers made them, to accuse the guiltlesse Lady, being in her captiuitie. Howbeit all that notwitstanding, no matter could be proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by all examinations, as she the same time lying at <hi>Woodstocke,</hi> had certaine intelligence, by the meanes of one <hi>Iohn Gayer:</hi> who vnder a coullorable pretence of a Letter to Mistresse <hi>Cleue</hi> from her Father, was let in, and so gaue them secretlie to vnderstande of all this matter. Wherevppon the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> at her departing out from <hi>VVoodstocke,</hi> wrote these Uerses with her Diamond in a glasse windowe.

               <p>And thus much touching the troubles of Lady <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> at <hi>VVoodstocke.</hi> Wherevnto this is more to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that during the same time, the Lord of <hi>Tame</hi> had la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to the Quéene, and became suretie for her, to haue
<pb facs="tcp:13261:37"/>
her from <hi>vvoodstocke</hi> to his house, and had obtained his graunt thereof: wherevpon preparation was made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinglie, and all thinges ready in expectation of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeth not suffered to come to the Lord of Tames house.</note> But thorowe the procurement either of Sir <hi>Henry Benifield,</hi> or by the dooing of <hi>vvinchester</hi> her mortall eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, Letters came ouer night to the contrarie, whereby her iourney was staide. Thus this woorthy Lady oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with continual sorrowe, could not be permitted to haue recourse to any fréendes she had: but still in the handes of her enimies was left desolate, and vtterlie destitute of all that might refreshe a dolefull heart, fraught full of terror and thraldome. Wherevpon no meruaile, if she hearing vpon a time out of her garden at <hi>vvoodstocke,</hi> a certaine <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeth wisheth her selfe to be a Milke maide.</note> Milke maide singing pleasauntly, wished her selfe to be a Milke maide as she was, saying: That her case was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and life more merier, then hers was, in that state as she was.</p>
               <p>Now after these thinges thus declared, to procéede fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where we left before, Sir <hi>Henrie Benifield</hi> and his Soldiors, with the Lord of <hi>Tame,</hi> and Sir <hi>Ralphe Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine</hi> garding and wayting vppon her: The first night from <hi>vvoodstocke,</hi> she came to <hi>Ricotte.</hi> In which iourney such a mightie winde did blowe, that her seruauntes were faine to holde downe her cloathes about her: in so much, that her Hood was twise or thrise blowne from her head. Whervpon she desirous to returne to a gentlemans house there néere, could not be suffered by Sir <hi>Henrie Benifield</hi> so to doo: but was constrained vnder a hedge, to trim her head as well as she could. After this, they iourneied the next night to Maister <hi>Dormers,</hi> and so to <hi>Colbrooke,</hi> where she laye all that night at the <hi>George.</hi> And by the way com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>Colbrooke,</hi> certaine of her Graces Gentlemen and Yeomen mette her, to the number of thrée score, much to all their comfortes, who had not séene her Grace of long season before: notwithstanding, they were commaunded in the Quéenes name immediatlie to depart the Towne, to both their and her Graces no little heauines, who could not
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:13261:37"/>
be suffered once to speake with them. So that night all her men were taken from her, sauing her gentleman Usher, three gentlewomen, two Groomes, and one of her War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droppe, the Soldiours watching and warding round about the house, and she close shut vp within her prison. The next day following, her Grace entred <hi>Hampton Court</hi> on the backe side, into the Princes lodging, the doores being shut to her, and she garded with Soldiours as before, lay there a fortnight at the least, or euer any had recourse vnto her. At length came the Lord <hi>William Haward,</hi> who meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous honourablie vsed her Grace: whereat she tooke much <note place="margin">The Lord Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Haward gentle and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Elizabeth.</note> comfort, and requested him to be a meane, that she might speake with some of the Councell. To whome (not long after) came the Bishop of <hi>vvinchester,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Shrewesburie,</hi> and Secretarie <hi>Peter,</hi> who with great humilitie humbled themselues to her Grace. She againe likewise saluting them, said. My Lords (quoth she) I am glad to sée you: for me thinkes I haue béen kept a great while from you desolately alone. Wherefore I would desire you, to be a meane to the King and Quéenes Maiesties, that I may be deliuered from prison, wherein I haue béene kept a long space, as to you my Lordes it is not vnknowne. When she had spoken, <hi>Stephen Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> the Bishoppe of <hi>vvinchester</hi> knéeled downe, and reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeth requested by Winchester, to submit her selfe to the Queenes mercie.</note> that she would submit herselfe to the Quéens Grace, and in so dooing, he had no doubt but her Maiestie would be good vnto her. She making aunswer: That rather then she would so doo, she would lie in prison all the dayes of her life, adding: That she craued no mercie at her Maiesties <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeth standeth to be tryed by the lawe.</note> hand, but rather desired the lawe, if euer she had offended her Maiestie, in woord, thought, or déede. And besides this, in yéelding (quoth she) I should speake against my selfe, and confesse my selfe to be an offendour, which neuer was towards her Maiestie: by occasion whereof, the King and Quéene might euer héereafter conceiue of me an euill opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And therefore I say my Lords, it were better for me to lie in prison for the trueth, then to be abroad and suspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:13261:38"/>
of my Prince. And so they departed, promising to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare her message to the Quéene.</p>
               <p>On the next day, the Bishop of <hi>VVinchester</hi> came againe vnto her Grace, and knéeling downe, declared that the <note place="margin">Talke againe betweene Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester and Lady Elizabeth.</note> Quéene meruailed, that she would so stoutlie vse her selfe, not confessing to haue offended: so that it should séeme, the Quéenes Maiestie wrongfullie to haue imprisoned her Grace. Nay (quoth the Lady <hi>Elizabeth)</hi> it pleaseth her to punish me as she thinketh good. Well (quoth <hi>Gardiner)</hi> her Maiesty willeth me to tell you, that you must tell an other tale, ere that you be set at libertie. Her Grace aunswered, <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeth denieth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse any fault doone to the Queene.</note> that she had as liefe be in prison with honestie and trueth, as to be abroade suspected of her Maiestie: and this that I haue saide, I will (saide she) stand vnto, for I will neuer belye my selfe. <hi>VVinchester</hi> againe knéeled downe, and said: Then your Grace hath the vauntage of me and other of the Lordes, for your so long and wrong imprisonment. What vauntage I haue (quoth she) you know, taking God to record, I séeke no aduauntage at your hands, for your so dealing with me: but God forgiue you and me also. With that the rest knéeled downe, desiring her Grace that all might be forgotten, and so departed, she being fast locked vp againe. A seuen-night after, the Quéene sent for her <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeth sent for to the Queene.</note> Grace at ten a clocke in the night, to speake with her: for she had not séene her in two yéeres before. Yet for all that she was amazed at the so sudden sending for, thinking it had béene wurse for her then afterwardes it prooued: and desired her gentlemen and gentlewomen to praye for her, for that she could not tell whether euer she should sée them againe or no. At which time Sir <hi>Henrie Benifield,</hi> with Mistresse <hi>Clarencius</hi> comming, her Grace was brought into the garden, vnto a stayres foote that went into the Quéenes lodging, her Graces gentlewomen waiting on her, her gentleman Usher and her Groomes going before with Torches: where her gentlemen and gentlewomen being commaunded to staie, all sauing one Woman, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse <hi>Clarencius</hi> conducted her to the Quéenes bed Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:13261:38"/>
where her Maiestie was. At the sight of whome her Grace knéeled downe, &amp; desired God to preserue her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, not mistrusting but that she should trie her selfe as <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeth, brought to the Queenes bed Chamber.</note> true a subiect towardes her Maiestie, as euer did any, and desired her Maiestie euen so to iudge of her, and saide: that she should not finde her to the contrarie, whatsoeuer report otherwise had gone of her. To whome the Quéene aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered: <note place="margin">Talke betweene the Queene and Lady Elizabeth.</note> You will not confesse your offence, but stande stoutlie to your trueth: I praie God it may so fall out. If it dooth not (quoth the Lady <hi>Elizabeth)</hi> I request neither fauour nor pardon at your Maiesties handes. Well (saide the Quéene) you still stiflie perseuer in your trueth: belike you will not confesse but that you haue béene wrongfullie punished. I must not saye so (it it please your Maiestie, quoth she) to you. Why then (saide the Quéene) belike you will to other. No, if it please your Maiestie (quoth she) I haue borne the burden, and must beare it. I humbly <note place="margin">Small comfort at the Queens hand toward her Sister</note> beséech your Maiestie to haue a good opinion of me, and to thinke me to be your true Subiect, not onelie from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning hitherto, but for euer, as long as lyfe lasteth. And so they departed with verie fewe comfortable wordes of the Quéene in Englishe: but what she saide in Spanishe, God knoweth. It is thought that King <hi>Phillip</hi> was there <note place="margin">King Phillip thought to be a freend to Lady Elizabeth.</note> behinde a cloath, and not séene, and that he shewed himselfe a verie fréend in that matter, &amp;c. Thus her Grace depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, went to her lodging againe, and the seuenight after was deliuered of Sir <hi>Henrie Benifield</hi> her Goaler (as she <note place="margin">Lady Elizabeth, by Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence set at ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie.</note> tearmed him) and his Soldiours, and so her Grace being set at libertie from imprisonment, went into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and had appointed to goe with her Sir <hi>Thomas Pope,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Sir Henrie Beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field discharged.</note> one of Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> Counsaylors, and one of her gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Ushers, Maister <hi>Gage.</hi> And thus straitlie was she loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked too all Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> time: and this is the discourse of her Highnesse imprisonment.</p>
               <p>Then there came to <hi>Lamheyre</hi> Maister <hi>Ierningham,</hi> and Maister <hi>Norris</hi> gentleman Usher, Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> men, who tooke away from her Grace Mistresse <hi>Ashley</hi> to

But such was the gratious and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable prouidence of the Lord, to the preseruation not onelie of her Royall Maiestie, but also the miserable and wofull state of this whole Iland, and poore Subiects of the same, whereby the proude platformes, and peeuishe practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of this wretched <hi>Achitophell</hi> preuailed not: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywise both he, and all the snares and trappes of his pernitious councell laide against an other, were turned to a nette to catch himselfe, according to the Prouerbe: <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum consilium consultori pessimum.</hi> After the death of this <note place="margin">How the Lord heere beganne to worke for Lady Elizabeth.</note>

               </p>
               <p>In this pittifull and rufull Historie, thou hast (O <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi> three especiall thinges to consider. First, the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the time then being, and the vnmercifulnesse of those mens hearts, who prepared all their deuillishe polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, <note place="margin">Consideration of the hardnesse of the time then, and the cruell dealing against Lady Elizabeth.</note> and inuented a world of wyles and deceites, whereby they might gaine oportunitie to destroy this woorthy and famous Lady, whose innocencie could not appease their blood thirstinesse, nor whose vertues could not asswage their cruell dealing: but euen as the wicked Iewes cried death against our Sauiour, euen so these vnnaturall men did their vttermost against this Noble Lady. Secondlie, thou art to note her woonderfull patience, her assured trust <note place="margin">Consideration of the wonderfull patience of Lady Elizabeth.</note> in God, who neuer fayled her: and euen when death was most of all threatned to her, and that many occasions was giuen for her to doubt the same, her patience was not any iote the more mooued, but being confident in God, to whom she referred the state of her innocencie, and extremitie of their rigorous intentes, she passed through all those ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies with a cheerefull and vndaunted heart, and their prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises to feare her was not so horrible, but her patience in suffering was as admirable. Thirdlie, thou must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, <note place="margin">Consideration of the present helpe of God at all times to Lady Elizabeth.</note> the ready working hand of God for her in all her daungers, how gratiouslie he preuented their deuises, and had such an especiall care ouer his Daughter, as no extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie whatsoeuer could preuaile against her.

Héere maiest thou O <hi>England</hi> (as in a Glasse) behold the successe of treason from time to time, by these so many and sundrie examples héere offered vnto thée, whereof full ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny remaine freshe and quicke in remembrance, thou maist discerne, how God, who placeth Kinges and Princes in their seates and Signories, and by whose appointment they haue their ruling on earth: dooth sharply chastise such wicked braunches, as deale otherwise then beséemes them with their Princes and Gouernours.

But let me <hi>England</hi> come a lyttle néerer thée, and order the matter so, as thou mayst finde thy selfe touched in déede. Perhappes thou wilt saye these thinges are doone and past, and they were but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine fewe that thus haue offended, and being iustly scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for their misdemeanours, they are now quite worne out of remembraunce, in hope there remaineth none such as they haue béene.

If thy children be so vnnatural, as to make their mother smart, thou shalt but shew thy selfe naturall in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring correction: for better they wéepe then thou bléede, so shall they in time finde it to their benefite, and thou thy selfe liue to be a happy mother.

               <p>But whence grow these daungerous practises? And who are they that set foote in these traiterous attempts? Alas it is soone seene, by reason the open apparaunce from time to time, dooth make it euident. There is no one that repineth <note place="margin">No greater eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of England, then Papists.</note> at her Maiesties safety, no one that lifteth at the wel setled gouernement of this Realme, nor any one more ready to pul down the chéefe piller of our happines: but either he is a Papist, or else meruailously addicted that way. And haue we not good cause so to perswade our selues, when we sée it dailie before our eyes, that they are men of that coate, and either haue receiued encouragement amongst their fellowes beyond Seas, or else haue béene imboldened by such as secretly flippe ouer into the Realme, to follow that traiterous intent which they long time haue practised. And then when God reuealeth their wicked spirites, and bringeth them into the lyght that they may be example to <note place="margin">The common speech of Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours at theyr death.</note> other: then they crie out, I am a Catholique, I will dye in the Catholique cause, and thus vnder shewe of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they would deceiue the world with their horrible trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.

               <p>For the first article that defineth Papistes, that accuseth <note place="margin">The meaning and proofe of the first conclusion.</note> them of treason to God, to Kinges, and to Realmes: if it be well weied, it cannot but quicklie be séen for vndoubted trueth. Though it be true, that euerie one that holdeth any one error, or article of doctrine that the Pope teacheth, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying from the word of God, is in that article a Papist, as for example, the heresie of Transubstantiation, the blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of popishe Masse, or any such other: yet count I not euerie such a one wholie a Papist within compasse of this article, that is, vnder the title of a traiterous Papist. But such a one as holdeth all the Popes doctrine to be true, that <note place="margin">Not all Papistes are traitours.</note> the Romane Church erreth not, that it hath rightfully such superioritie and primacie in others Kingdomes and Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceses, <note place="margin">Note this Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> as it hath proudlie claimed and vsurped, and that Christians are bound to referre their faith vnto it, and to hang vpon the Popes determinations. Many men other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise good and honest Subiectes, are not purged of all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, wherewith <hi>Rome</hi> hath infected them, and must haue
<pb facs="tcp:13261:46"/>
their time to be better instructed. But those that are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Papistes, that publishe the Pope to be head of the Church (which yet in déede is no member of the true <note place="margin">Which Papistes are traytours.</note> Church) and would haue vs with an implicite and bonde faith, to depend vpon that Sea, and for that reason will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse by all meanes, to confesse the right of Princes in their Kingdomes ouer all their Subiectes: they be perfect tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours in déede, yea, and the learned sort of them be wilfull Heretikes and Traitours. For though in the darke <note place="margin">Learned Papists wilfull traitours.</note> times, when controuersies of Religion were not brought into searching, the streame of error carried men away without doubting: yet since that by debating, the light hath béene euidentlie opened, and men haue sought and throughlie examined the matter, there is no learned Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist, but he knoweth that he maintaineth error, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending and spreading the same, he defendeth &amp; spreadeth, and so directlie, aduisedlie, wilfullie and maliciouslie, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in execution to his vttermost power, high treasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, against Kinges and their Kingdomes. Against God I call them treasons, though our Lawe, the iudge of ciuill treasons in <hi>England,</hi> haue no such name, because the <note place="margin">Treason, offence against Maiesty.</note> nature of the offence so properlie receiueth that tytle, and also the vsuall name of high treason in <hi>Iure gentium,</hi> in the common lawe of Nations, and in other languages, dooth so plainelie expresse it. High treasons are in their true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, offences against high Maiestie, that is, either to the destruction of the persons, or deniall and defacement of the iust dignities and authorities, of those that beare the name of Maiestie, and to whome the highest duetie of obedience, faith and alleageaunce extendeth. And therfore is treason called <hi>Crimen lesae Maiestatis,</hi> the crime of violating or abating Maiestie. Greater Maiestie then the Maiestie of God cannot be: therefore higher and verier treasons then against God cannot be. His person cannot be destroyed, or <note place="margin">Treason against God.</note> touched: but his dignitie, honour, glorie and authoritie may be slaundered and blasphemed, and his Subiects, who are mortall men, may be withdrawne from their due obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:13261:46"/>
and drawne into rebellion against him. And this I say is high treason to God, to violate or abate the Maiestie of God: and this doo Papists. For though God be King of <note place="margin">Papists violate the Maiestie of God, which is high treason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</note> the whole world, and so is rightlie called the Lord by vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall name, yea, euen of deuilles: yet is his Church his more proper and certaine kingdome, whereby he is more restrainedlie and aplie called our King and our Father, and so more fitlie called our head in respect of the body, which is his Church, and not the rest of the world. In this Kingdome his highest dignitie is to be the onelie head ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which the Papistes take from him, and deriue it to their Pope. And though with gloses they excuse it, that their Popes take it not from God, but vse it vnder God, as his Uicares: yet must they be admonished, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sufficient deputation, and warrant from the King him selfe, (which the Pope hath not) the Subiect to thrust him selfe into the gouernance of the kingdome, is high treason, where he that being a straunger would séeke to conquere it, were but an enimie. And so is it rightlie to be saide, that <note place="margin">The Pope an high Traitour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, and the Turke but an enimie.</note> the <hi>Turke</hi> is to God an enimie, and the Pope is to God a traitour, and all his adherents are principall traitours: for treason admitteth no accessaries.</p>
               <p>But now let vs come to that part, which toucheth men <note place="margin">Papists Traitours to Kinges and Kingdomes.</note> more néerelie then any loue of God. Let vs now sée how they be traytours to Kinges and Kingdomes. If we haue minde to sée that Papistes, which holde all the Popes doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine to be true, are traytours in déede to Kings and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes: it behooueth vs to call to minde what are the Popes doctrines, dooinges and practises concerning the Crownes of Kinges, and states of Kingdomes. Popes haue challenged, and Papistes (that affirme the Popes to be frée from error, their doctrine to be true, and their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to be lawfull) doo also holde, that it is their due which <note place="margin">Traiterous doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of Popes for Kinges and Kingdomes.</note> they challenge, that is: To haue authority of both Swords, Spirituall and Temporall, the one in exercise, the other in power: To haue the disposition of all the Crownes of Christian Princes: To haue the iudgement of deciding,
<pb facs="tcp:13261:47"/>
to whome the right of any kingdome belongeth: To haue power for disobedience to him, or by his discretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the Crownes of Kinges to whome he will: To haue lawfull power, to giue Kingdomes to prey, spoyle and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, to such as can inuade and possesse them: To haue power to assoyle and discharge Christian subiectes, from faith and alleageaunce to theyr lawful and naturall Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Lordes, Kinges and Princes: To haue power to giue leaue, yea, commaundement, blessing, reward, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse of sinnes, and Heauen it selfe, to Subiects to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell <note place="margin">The Pope will giue heauen to Subiectes, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell against their Prince.</note> against theyr Prince, to depose the Prince, disherite and destroy him: That there is of common right, and by the méere lawe of God, reserued to the Pope a speciall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, resorte, appellation, and obedience of one great part of all Princes Subiectes, yea, and of all Subiectes of all Princes in one great part of theyr causes. Be not these heinous treasons? And these cannot be denied, to be the naturall and verie treasons of all Papists, that is to say, of all that depend vpon credite of the Pope, that holde him for Gods Uicar, for <hi>Peters</hi> successor, for whome Christ prayed, that his faith should not fayle, that applie to him this title: <hi>Ad quem perfidia non potest accedere,</hi> to whome falsehood cannot reach, that holde him for a constant Rocke, an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Preacher of trueth, an Apostolicall man, if he be not some other thing then a man, to whome our beléefe is bounden: with such other false tytles, wherewith Popes themselues, haue garnished themselues, and theyr Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites haue ouerloden them.</p>
               <p>Consider the ordinarie practise of Popes and Papistes according to these doctrines, and then you shall sée, that <note place="margin">Traiterous doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges of Papistes against Kinges &amp; Kingdomes: spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall matter for England to marke.</note> from the most high treason, which the Pope committed against his Soueraigne Lord the Emperour: the renting and destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Empire: all the victories and successes of the Saracens and Turkes against Christendome: all the tearing away of most noble and large Kingdomes and prouinces, from the body of Christianitie: all the subduing and thralling of infinite Christian soules, to Mahomet and

the Deuill: all the deposinges, murderinges, turmoylings, ciuill warres, debates betwéene Christian Princes, shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Christian blood, indignities and oppressions of Christian Kinges and Emperours, conquestes, rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions and mischéefes, for these fiue hundred yéeres and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue: are wholly and chéefely to be imputed to the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Popes and Papistes. All <hi>Grecia</hi> (sometime most noble and learned) yet lamentably rueth it. All <hi>Affrica,</hi> the mother of most constaunt Martyres, féeleth it. The <hi>Germane</hi> Emperours, with most heinous reproches, and fowle treading on theyr neckes, may not forget it. The Kinges of <hi>Fraunce</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> both at home in their natiue Kingdomes, and abroad, as well in <hi>Naples, Sicilie, Lombar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi> as in other territories of <hi>Italie</hi> and of the Empire, haue sharply felt it.

Thus is it plaine, that for as much as the Pope claymeth such wrongful vsurpation and tiranny, ouer Kings &amp; Realmes, and sith Papists holde that he sayth true, and claymeth but his right, and cannot erre in discerning it: all such Papists are Traitours to all Kinges and Kingdomes.</p>
               <p>As for the second Conclusion, which accuseth Englishe Papistes of treason to the Quéenes Maiestie: it is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientlie <note place="margin">The second con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, prouing Englishe Papistes traytours to the Queene.</note> prooued, for that it is a perticular within a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, included in the former. Yet for the speciall confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, it hath certaine priuate and seuerall reasons.
<pb facs="tcp:13261:49"/>
It is well knowne, and you haue read the whole discourse before, how they sought her Graces death in her Sisters time, what practises, what fetches were vsed for it, what examinations, what searchinges, were to finde couller of her destruction: yea, how farre without couller they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeded, if God had not miraculouslie kept her, to the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of this Realme, and the comfort of all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. But to make some demonstration of their hatred to her Maiestie by reason, &amp; after to discend to the examples and practises: let vs examine the causes.</p>
               <p>Whereas the Papistes holde, that the Pope is head of <note place="margin">Papists that hold the Pope head of the Church in England, are traytours to her Maiestie.</note> Gods vniuersall Church, and that such authoritie as the Quéene claimeth in <hi>England,</hi> ouer Ecclesiasticall persons and in Ecclesiasticall causes, as due to her Highnesse in right of her Crowne, is not due to her, but belonging to the Pope: in so saying, they must saye that her Maiestie claymeth an vniust tyrannicall power. And who so euer shall so saye, though not in the same sillables: is an vniust and an errant traitour, and cannot loue her that hath pul led him downe whome they call head of their Church.</p>
               <p>Where the Pope hath accurssed the Quéenes Maiestie as an Heretique and Scismatique, all those Papists which <note place="margin">Papistes that hold the Popes excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against the Queene lawfull, are traytours.</note> suppose, that the Pope hauing the disposition of Gods sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and the thunderbolte of exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication in his hand, cannot erre: doo also suppose that the Quéenes Highnesse, (our Quéene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> I meane) is not lawfull Quéene of <hi>England,</hi> (as many of them haue not spared to saye) for so must all Papistes holde, that holde the Pope to say true, for the Pope dooth not so accept her. And Papistes haue published, that Gospellers, whome they call Heretiques, ought not to haue any office among Gods people, much lesse a Kingdome. And this point is well to be considered, that they which take from the Quéenes Maiestie, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie ouer Ecclesiastical persons and causes: doo trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the same iurisdiction to the Pope, for they neuer yet vouchsafed to giue it to any other. And yet I am sure, that after so many examples of Bées and Beastes and other
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:13261:49"/>
thinges, they will not nowe haue any perticular Church headlesse, and destitute of a supreme Gouernour: either vniuersal like a Monarch as they would haue it, or speciall vnder God of eche Kingdome or Dominion, as Gods good disposition hath forced it. If then the Pope haue (in their opinion) any Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction in <hi>England,</hi> he must <note place="margin">The Pope can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in England, vnlesse he had iust authoritie so to doo.</note> haue <hi>I us excommunicandi,</hi> lawfull power and authority to exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate in <hi>England:</hi> without which the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call power cannot stand. Which power if he iustlie haue, &amp; hath excommunicated and accurssed her Maiestie, either by especiall name (as he dooth) or generallie vnder tytle of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques, of which sort he estéemeth her: then hath he ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doone <hi>Pro suo iure</hi> as he might lawfullie doo. And this being so supposed true, then is it good to consider what is taken for Gods lawe, and the lawe Ecclesiasticall <hi>De vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandis excommunicatis,</hi> for shunning of excommunicate <note place="margin">Papistes drawe obedience from the Queene.</note> and accurssed persons, which yéeld not to any repentaunt submission, or reconciliation to the Church. Forsooth, that euery christian on paine of exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication <hi>De iure</hi> (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to dye, is thought to dye in state of damnation) is bound to withdrawe from such accurssed persons not repenting, all fréendlie or louing company and countenaunce, all ayde and reléefe, all seruice and obedience. Which dooing, for <note place="margin">Papistes merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious treason.</note> these good Subiectes of <hi>England,</hi> to put in execution toward the Quéene, were a verie meritorious acte. But what dooth it merite? The iust paines of treason, for breaking their due alleageaunce, and eternall damnation (if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent not) for resisting Gods lawfull ordinaunce. This géere goeth sore, it is verie euident and plaine, that by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie consequence, to this confession of trayterousnesse they must be driuen, if they will continue Papistes, that is, will affirme the Popes sentences not to erre, or will giue the Pope any spirituall iurisdiction in <hi>England.</hi> But such salues are not vnlyke to come out of his shoppe, that dispenseth with breach of faith, yea, that openlie proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that there is no faith to be kept with Christs fréends and his aduersaries. His shoppe that can send out badges,
<pb facs="tcp:13261:50"/>
with leaue to sweare and vnsweare, with so lyberall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, as to saye: <hi>Giue me thy heart and it suffyseth.</hi> And well may it suffise, for the heart will carrie the hand too, when oportunitie serueth, and when their <hi>Golden day</hi> approcheth, of which they make so great account. Such fellowes would be well looked on. And because they cannot gette her Highnesse to ceasse to be their lawfull Quéene, themselues haue ceassed to be her actuall Subiectes. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they cannot shifte her Maiestie from her Crowne, they haue shifted themselues out of her Highnesse Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and are fled beyond the Seas. Some being there, send hyther their hereticall, seditious &amp; traiterous Bookes: <note place="margin">Seditious writers that send theyr trayterous Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belles into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> yet licenced there, against good president of Princes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the example of her Maiesties demeanour toward the same Princes, which by themselues or their Officers, rather ought to haue restrained such dooings, then to leaue so shrewd occasion, of taking harme themselues by the like. In these Bookes her right is impugned: her faith is defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: her gouernement is discredited: her honour is tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: <note place="margin">The circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stances of those trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Bookes.</note> her Maiestie is many wayes violated and abated: the Religion that her Highnesse holdeth and publisheth, is called Scismaticall, Hereticall, Deuillish, and with as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yll fauoured names as they can rehearse, being yet in such eloquence perfect Oratours. The Preachers and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours of the Religion, that her Highnesse setteth foorth and professeth, are tearmed wurse then Infidels: her tytle of Supremacie ouer all her Subiectes, is defaced for an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped and vndue name, and her Subiectes hearts aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and perswade to grudge against her. These wicked and trayterous Pamphlettes want no fauourers to spread <note place="margin">These trayterous Bookes want no fauourers to spread them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and to credit them with what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they may.</note> them abroade, nor doo they that disperse them lacke any boldnesse, to reade them in audiences &amp; in corners: where they commend them, defend them, giue them great prayses for learning and substantialnesse, as matters vnaunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, when God he knowes there is no such surpassing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie in them, as they that haue the spurres yet stic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in theyr sides, and haue béene broken winded with
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:13261:50"/>
ouer gallopping them, yea, they that are of their owne fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion haue not béen ashamed to speake it, how notablie they haue béen wounded by many of her Maiesties learned sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes. Neuerthelesse, they continue writing still, and all pretences that both the Pope and Papistes can deuise, are daily and hourely spread abroad in the Realme, to weaken the good willes of her Maiesties Subiects toward her, and by all false and vaine coullers they can imagine, they prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise how to drawe more subiectes to take their parts. But in the meane time, as God gathereth his glorie out of all things, yea, euen out of sinnes: so <hi>England,</hi> out of this great <note place="margin">The euyll dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Papistes, a good lesson for England.</note> euill thou maist gather some good, a good example and good lesson for thée to learne, that Papistrie is treason, and he that is infected with treason is a traitour, and so prouide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them héerafter. Let them folow what humours they please, doo thou in the meane time take a contrarie course. Where they looke for an other time, doo thou endeuour to maintaine this time: Where they reach with expectation to altering of gouernement, doo thou bend all thy force, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie and meanes of seruice, to the defence of this estate: Where they pray for change, specially of Quéenes, do thou pray for the long and happy continuaunce of her Highnesse raigne: Where they hide rebellious stomackes, doo thou and thy Children shewe true and faithfull hearts: Where they desire, that her Maiestie and her Councell may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, with flattering &amp; erronious pretence of policie, and couller of clemency, that vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shadowe they may lurke, and be nourished as serpent in bosome, doo thou praye to God to giue iudgement to discerne them, to search the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of their treasons, that they may be shaken out, &amp; vsed as daungerous vipers: Where their trust is in the Pope, and popish treasons and conspiracies, let thy confidence be in God and his prouidence, not shrinking from the same with thy best courage and prudence: Where they will not sticke to vse all subtill vndermininges, and will not lose the vauntage of times, that they may one daye triumph in cruel violence, doo thou pray, that on this part be vsed all

good policies, that Gods offered meanes and good oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie be not refused and ouerslipped, that God rent not the Kingdome from his annointed, for sparing of his enimies: but that it maye long flourishe in the handes of his most noble and vertuous handmaid, our most excellent and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Soueraigne Lady. Thus is it euident by reasons and examples, what hearts Papistes beare to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie.</p>
               <p>The third Conclusion, that such Englishe Papistes are traitours to the Realme of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. hath receiued two <note place="margin">The third con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion proouing English papistes, traytours to the Realme of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> prooues already: the one in the general treasons of all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes to all Realmes, wherein <hi>England</hi> and Englishe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes are included, the other in their traiterous mindes to the Quéenes Maiesties person and dignitie, which is the highest treason that can be to the Realme of <hi>England.</hi> Yet are there some other perticular dooinges more speciallie to enforce it, namelie the experience that hath béene, of their casting away the care of their Countrie, and all other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall affections: to the ende with all immanitie, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious vnnaturall crueltie, to torment Englishe Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and to subiect the Realme to forreine power, for their false religions sake. I am assured there are enow, and too many that can remember, both that they haue read in cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Histories, and séene in lamentable experience: howe the Papistes haue shewed themselues so addicted to their <note place="margin">The Papistes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence to theyr Pope, hath made them carelesse of theyr Prince and Countrie.</note> superstition, and so captiued to an vndue reuerence of their tyrannous Pope, that they haue for it reiected the care of Countrie, and of those to whome naturall duetie bounde them.</p>
               <p>It is certaine, that that Englishe man which can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented for Papistrie, to rayse or fauour rebellion in our Countrie: to ioyne in conspiracie with Straungers, to helpe to inuade and spoyle our Countrie: to conuey the Crowne of our Country to a forreiner: to agrée with them in faction, that offer our Countrie to prey, spoyle and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest: to submitte his faith to that Potentate, that hath accurssed and giuen our Countrie, their soules to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:13261:51"/>
and their bodies, landes and possessions to them that can catch them: to beléeue or fauour them, that spreade all vile dishonours against our Countrie: to lyke well of his dooings, and to holde that he dooth no more then he lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may doo, which being an Alien, a forreine Bishop, shall take vppon him to extend his curse to the Prince of our Countrie, and all the people thereof, and that he hath po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to discharge the Subiectes of the Realme from their faith and alleageaunce, and hath authoritie to binde their obedience to whome he will, and is able to giue Heauen to rebelles, that shall venter their liues in wasting and <note place="margin">Such an one as alloweth of all these wicked cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, must needes be a traytour to his Countrie.</note> destroying our Countrie: He, I saye, that can yéelde his consent to these dooinges and thinkinges, must néedes be a Traitour to his Countrie. And such a one is euerie such English Papist as I haue described, and can be none other if he holde the Pope for a true teacher, and haue good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Popes doctrine and examples.</p>
               <p>That clemencie and gentlenesse cannot reclayme them from trayterous mindes, while they continue in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistrie, <note place="margin">Clemencie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not win a Papist whyle he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth a Papist: speciall examples for England to remember.</note> is as plaine and as true a fourme of spéeche: as if a man should saye, they must néedes be traytours, so long as they remaine full of treason, for treason and Papistrie are vnseperable whyle they be kept vnder, euen as cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and Papistrie are vnseperable when they are gotten aboue. Surelie, he that regardeth not the highest duetie, will neuer regard the meanest. The duetie of the loue or feare of God, cannot holde a Papist from blasphemie against God. The duetie of faith and alleageaunce to his Prince, cannot kéepe a Papist from treason to his Prince. The duetie of déere loue to his naturall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, cannot withdrawe a Papist from assenting to, yea, and procuring the spoyle, destruction, bondage, and alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his Countrie, as I haue already prooued. The duetie of kinde and naturall pittie, cannot staye a Papist from murdering the féeble sexe, nor the sielie tender infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, nor reuerend eldest age. The duetie of familiaritie in youth, of fréendshippe in grauer yéeres, of continuall
<pb facs="tcp:13261:52"/>
societie during all the life passed, with heapes of mutuall commodities, cannot pull backe a Papist from immanitie of Sacrificing his déerest fréendes. The duetie of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Children to Parentes, or loue of Parentes to Children, remooueth not a Papist from vnnaturall cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie. The duetie of intire loue and fellowshippe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene man and wife, holdeth no place in the heart of a Papist. No duetie of kindred, no estimation of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Uertue, no good respect, that mooueth good men to loue and compassion, once toucheth a stubborne Papist.</p>
               <p>All these dueties we haue séene broken, yea, neglected <note place="margin">All dueties of loue, kindred and nature bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Papistes.</note> and throwne awaie by Papistes. And is there hope that clemencie can so farre winne them, as to holde them in trueth to the Prince, from whome they receyue it: if oportunitie serue to bring them out of her daunger, or her Highnesse into their daunger, which God forbidde? But let vs sée a little of their thankefulnesse. Did euer those Papistes, whose liues were saued by good Bishop <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Example of the Papistes thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes to Bishop Cranmer.</note> meanes, who were brought vp, who were defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, who were auaunced, who were shielded from harme and perill by him: once requite him with one droppe of kindnesse? And yet they spake him fayre in his prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Auailed the great liberalitie of King <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight, to rayse vp any kinde remembraunce in Papistes, that were great in Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes: to staye them <note place="margin">Example of the Papistes kindnes toward her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, for the great lyberalitie of her most noble Father.</note> from the assenting to the captiuitie and daunger, and sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the blood of his most noble Daughter, our most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Soueraigne Lady? And yet during King <hi>Henries</hi> raigne, they shewed a seruiceable face: as if they would haue spent their bloods, to kéepe wrong from him and his, and did serue against Papistrie it selfe, till their treason and Papistrie was ripe to be aduaunced. A number lyke examples of their gentlenesse and kindnesse might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, but because I would be bréefe, these fewe shall serue at this time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:13261:52"/>
Of like trueth it is, that Papistrie being an Heresie, or rather a bondle made vp of an infinite number of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies: must néedes haue the propertie of Heresie, to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishe <note place="margin">Papistrie increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth and flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth by lenitie.</note> with indulgence and lenitie. We sée the lyke ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in the sect of <hi>Arrians,</hi> which vnder hereticall Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours excéedinglie increased: and being once condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and restrained by punishment, hath worne away to a fewe. So farre as King <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight went in refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Religion, which was to abolishe the primacie of <hi>Rome</hi> out of this Realme (a noble conquest) with certaine grosse Idolatries: did not the seueritie of his Lawes, the awe of his person, and the dread of due execution, so holde downe those partes of Papistrie which he suppressed, that they durst not once shewe themselues in his dayes? And yet in the same time, the gréeuous lawe of sixe Articles made against Gods trueth, and sinisterlie procured by the Popish Clergie, nor yet the earnest inquirie, nor cruell executing of it by Bishoppes and other, could holde downe the trueth of the Gospell: but that it brake out more and more vpon them.</p>
               <p>The reason is, that Papistry and Christian trueth haue <note place="margin">Christian trueth respecteth Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and Papistry the world.</note> two seuerall endes: trueth respecteth Heauen, and Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie the world. Whereby their aduentures and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises are commonlie diuers: the Papist dare boldlie set vpon any mischéefe, where he hath hope to auaunce his falsehood: the Christian dare constauntlie abide any tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to giue witnesse of Gods trueth. And such qualitie of Gods trueth haue the auncient Fathers described, when one of them calleth the blood of Martyres: The water to water Gods Garden, an other sayth: That they encrease with cutting downe, and other in other manner haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed the same meaning.</p>
               <p>But now being vnder a Christian Prince in dayes of rest (blessed be almightie God, and long preserued be her Maiestie the instrument of it) as it is not méete that Gods Church, after <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostataes manner, be persecuted
<pb facs="tcp:13261:53"/>
to make it increase, but holden downe with good disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline for manners, that it growe not wilde and runne into wantonnesse: so is not the Church of the Deuill to be maintained and multiplied with indulgence, winking and slacknesse of correction, but with good seueritie to be restrained, that it growe not to such ranknesse, as to choke the true Church in déede. Mercie may haue her excesse, <note place="margin">Too much cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie may be great crueltie.</note> and clemencie may be great crueltie, when it ouerfloweth to the good mens daunger.</p>
               <p>The other Conclusions that followe, haue great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from these whereof I haue made some explication, yet haue I not made so large an explication, as trueth is well and easilie able to furnishe, neither can I so well make it, as the expedience of the cause asketh, to giue the vauntage of eloquence to the goodnesse of the matter, to helpe to drawe it into credite, and effect of well moouing. But being as it is, rude and true, great cunning and finenesse is the lesse néedefull: where those (for whome it is intended) are so wise, as it is farre more easie for naked troth to enforme them, then for any gaie spéeche to leads them.</p>
               <p>As for the other Conclusions that followe: I neither haue nor will wade so farre in them, because they are mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of consultation and meditation. The effect thereof, which is the safe preseruation of the Quéenes royall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie and the Realme, the auoiding of daungers that threaten the same, the establishing of assurednesse, bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, courage, and fréedome of her Highnesse most good Councellours and Subiectes, the taking auauntage of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie and occasions, the wéeding out of deceiuers and vnderminers, the defence of her Maiesties honour and dignity, the meanes to aunswer their charge toward God, and namelie, in dealing with men as they be affectioned to or against God.</p>
               <p>The effect I saye of these other Conclusions, I knowe doo continuallie busie her Maiestie and her most honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

               <p>Let vs praye, that we may sée when those that shall wrest or procure to chaunge Lawe, to erect the courage of any daungerous Uiper to such endes, or to any aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring hope of preuenting and vndermining, vnder what couller, name, pretence, or otherwise, or to the safegarde of their persons that haue so attempted: that they maye be declared, and executed as enimies to the state, and to the Quéenes safetie.</p>
               <p>Let vs praye, that we may sée such Lawes prouided for her Highnesse preseruation, and the same so executed <note place="margin">God graunt that such Papistes as be enimies to her Maiestie and the Realme, may be quickly cutte off.</note> without restraint or slackenesse for any respect: as the hope of Papistes, such as be enimies to God, the Quéene and the Realme, may (if they repent not) be cutte off for euer.</p>
               <p>Let vs praye to liue to sée, that none may haue place, Office, or accesse into her Maiesties Court nor household, no, nor once into her presence: that shall not be knowne to fauour both God and her, so farre as any circumspection or policie can prouide it.</p>
               <p>Let vs praye, that no Office of dignitie, Lawe or Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, may be in their handes, who doo not fauour the Lawe of God, and acknowledge her Maiesties right, that is head of Lawe and Iustice in this Realme.</p>
               <p>Let vs praye, that her Maiestie and her Councell may haue such particular knowledge of men, that those that haue well deserued, yea, haue and yet doo hazard their

liues in her Maiesties defence, and haue vtterlie wasted themselues and their fréendes in her Maiesties seruice, yet remaining vnrecompenced: that they maye not loose the benefite of their labours, that no euill tongue maye raise slaunder to their discredite, but that they maye ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their good seruice, be effectuallie and duelie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, the onelie meane to encourage other to earnest taking of paines.</p>
               <p>Let vs praye, that all such as be her Maiesties eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies may be weakened, and her faithfull fréendes and well-willers strengthened: that all auauntages may be vsed for her safetie, and all subtill deuises and practises may be supplanted.</p>
               <p>We trust it will be so, for God hath not drawne these late mischéefes into lyght for nothing. But before all thinges, let vs praye to GOD to sende vs true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, more ioyfull and effectuall receyuing of his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and more and more vertuous ensuing it: least as we lost our best King with liuing yll, wee loose our best Quéene with liuing wurse.</p>
               <p>And that therewith it may please him, to direct all the dooinges of her Maiestie and her Councell, to procéede in their good aduauncing his glorie, and preseruation of the estate: which without ielous circumspection, for preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Quéenes most royall personne, can not be doone. And that such good meanes and prouisions, as GOD of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth to that ende, be not refused or neglected: which were to tempt GOD, to forsake his cause, to betraie our noble Prince, and to giue away, or rather cast away the Realme.</p>
               <p>These be the daylie and nightlie prayers of good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, and while we busie our selues with these prayers, we doo, after our principall confidence in Gods goodnesse, rest our selues vppon the trust of her Maiestie, and her most honourable Councell: for whome we prayse God, and to them we referre the guiding of vs and ours, readie

to followe them when we are commaunded, with the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost of our power and perill, knowing how they spare not their vttermost endeuour and perill, with susteining the most vnpleasaunt life (God knowes) that may be, for our sakes, for our quiet, profits and defence.</p>
