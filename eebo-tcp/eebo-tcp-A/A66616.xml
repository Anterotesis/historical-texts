            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>I Who afore made <hi>Elegies</hi> by Art,</l>
               <l>Now <hi>Nature</hi> vents, and bleeds one from my Heart.</l>
               <l>Let Words with Sorrow drunk, from my <hi>Soul</hi> reel,</l>
               <l>Diſorder'd as the Paſſions that I feel,</l>
               <l>To groan this Loſs: A Loſs ſo near, ſo great!</l>
               <l>A Loſs ſo Univerſal; ſo Compleat!</l>
               <l>A Loſs which ſcarce admits of a Relief;</l>
               <l>The deepeſt, ſenſibleſt, ſagacious Grief,</l>
               <l>Can't reach to its unfathom'd Conſequence!</l>
               <l>A Loſs above Expreſſion, and our Senſe!</l>
               <l>A man of Men! A Man of <hi>God</hi> did die!</l>
               <l>His Foes, that knew him, this will teſtifie.</l>
               <l>When, firſt, to's <hi>Soul</hi> an Heavenly Spark was ſent,</l>
               <l>It ſhone, and gave a Luſtre where he went.</l>
               <l>No ſooner <hi>Holineſs</hi> was planted there,</l>
               <l>It did appear about him every where:</l>
               <l>It ſelf diffus'd, with Beams moſt clear and ſtrong,</l>
               <l>Through the whole <hi>Series</hi> of his Life along.</l>
               <l>So all that knew him, and know things aright,</l>
               <l>Knew that he was a <hi>Bright and Shining Light.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Some few rejoyc'd, too, in his <hi>Light</hi> a while;</l>
               <l>Who now their Loſs, as well as we, bewail.</l>
               <l>To <hi>Neighbours</hi> Courteous: When their Wants but cry'd,</l>
               <l>Relief from <hi>Purſe,</hi> and <hi>Counſel,</hi> not deny'd.</l>
               <l>None's Help was readier, nor no Heart ſo free,</l>
               <l>To the Diſtreſſed; none more kind than He:</l>
               <l>But more to <hi>Thoſe,</hi> who thirſted for his <hi>Blood</hi>?</l>
               <l>He thirſted too; but 'twas to do them Good:</l>
               <l>Good to their <hi>Souls,</hi> their <hi>Bodies,</hi> their <hi>Eſtate</hi>:</l>
               <l>And thus, with Kindneſs, he repair'd their Hate.</l>
               <l>Bounteous in Alms: A Charity ſo large;</l>
               <l>Tho' State but ſmall, and numerous his Charge.</l>
               <l>He ne'er could have his Liberal Aims purſu'd,</l>
               <l>Had not the Bleſſing <hi>Oyl</hi> and <hi>Meal</hi> renew'd.</l>
               <l>Wonders alike, tho' not ſo great as thoſe,</l>
               <l>Where Thouſands fed their Bellies with <hi>Few Loaves.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Whole Crowds of <hi>Poor</hi> ne'er ſought his Door in vain;</l>
               <l>He did their <hi>Souls,</hi> and <hi>Stomachs,</hi> entertain:</l>
               <l>He judg'd them not ſufficiently well fed,</l>
               <l>Till he had offer'd them <hi>Eternal Bread.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>The <hi>Family of Faith</hi> fed as his Own;</l>
               <l>His <hi>Houſe</hi> gave large, his <hi>Heart</hi> a larger Room.</l>
               <l>All that his Houſe, or Subſtance, could afford;</l>
               <l>His Fields, his Stable, or his Beds or Board,</l>
               <l>To treat ſuch Gueſts, they alwayes ready find:</l>
               <l>How wide an Hand; how bountiful a Mind!</l>
               <l>How noble, large, and general <hi>Soul</hi> he had?</l>
               <l>He lov'd the <hi>Good,</hi> and pitied all the <hi>Bad</hi>:</l>
               <l>O're whom he wept: With preſſing Eagerneſs,</l>
               <l>He beg'd and woo'd, t' accept of <hi>Happineſs.</hi>

               <l>And when the Earth, to the whole Land, was wild;</l>
               <l>To him, alone, was eaſie, kind, and mild.</l>
               <l>And tho' pale <hi>Famine</hi> threat'ned all the Land,</l>
               <l>An Army of Joyful <hi>Corn</hi> for him did ſtand,</l>
               <l>In monſtrous thickneſs, 'fore the Winds, do ſail;</l>
               <l>Waving their double, <unclear>triple</unclear> Heads, each Gale:</l>
               <l>Their Heads, with Bleſſings, bow'd, rever'd their <hi>God,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And offer to his Servant all their Load.</l>
               <l>The Miracle, like <unclear>nimble</unclear> Lightning, flew,</l>
               <l>And fill'd all Tongues with things ſo great, ſo new.</l>
               <l>The Good rejoyc'd; his Troublers loſt their Rage;</l>
               <l>Since <hi>God</hi> ſo plainly did for him engage:</l>
               <l>The Furious ceaſe to roar; contract their Paws;</l>
               <l>Let fall the Liſt-up Engine of the Laws.</l>
               <l>This <hi>Prodigy</hi> had ſtruck their Outrage mute:</l>

               <l>Ere long, <hi>God</hi>'s ſleeping Thunder will awake.</l>
               <l>Some this Side <hi>Hell</hi> ſhall taſte his angry Cup;</l>

                  <l>But this <hi>Meek Saint</hi> for theſe did Intercede:</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>God</hi>'s Love and Mercy, <unclear>not</unclear> Revenge, did plead:</l>
                  <l>And ſought to ſtop the Plagues, that o'er them ſpread.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Nor ſwell'd, for him that Miracles came down;</l>
                  <l>Tho' Prais'd his <hi>God</hi> for wondrous Favors ſhown:</l>
                  <l>But ſtill his Joys ſome greater Cauſe did own.</l>
               </lg>
               <l>For here the Pillar of his Comforts ſtood,</l>
               <l>That <hi>Chriſt</hi> for him had ſhed his Precious Blood.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus liv'd the Worthy, lov'd by <hi>God</hi> and Man;</l>
               <l>His Fruitful Years thus to their Period ran.</l>
               <l>No Day, nor Hour, paſs'd without its Pain;</l>
               <l>Nor ſcarce a Minute ſtole away in vain.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Goodneſs</hi> his <hi>Meat</hi> and <hi>Drink</hi>; his Day and Night,</l>
               <l>His <hi>Maſter</hi>'s <hi>Service</hi> was his whole Delight.</l>
               <l>He ſpends himſelf for <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and was ſpent:</l>
               <l>His Strength conſumed, and his Vitals rent.</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>Death ſpy'd the 'vantage; crept a Conqu'ror in;</l>
                  <l>On his ſpent Vitals preys and preys agen:</l>
                  <l>The Fort demoliſhes; which he did win:</l>
               </lg>
               <l>Invades the Seat of Life, with every Dart;</l>
               <l>And very buſie was about his Heart.</l>
               <l>Now Nature ſtruggling ſtrong with inward, pains</l>
               <l>My waſted Vitals.—Oh! my Breaſt complains.</l>
               <l>As Nature fades, his Graces brighter ſhone;</l>
               <l>Now, <hi>Heaven</hi> in view, his Soul moves ſwifter on.</l>
               <l>An earneſt Longing egg'd him to be free,</l>
               <l>As Pris'ners at the Point of Liberty.</l>
               <l>
                  <unclear>Impatient,</unclear> urging, weary of Delay:</l>
               <l>Thus long'd his Soul to leave its Houſe of Clay.</l>
               <l>Yet murmur'd not; thought his <hi>Lord</hi>'s Time the beſt:</l>
               <l>Tho' tyr'd; with <hi>Patience,</hi> vaited for his Reſt.</l>
               <l>His humble Thoughts ſtill judg'd all things too Good;</l>
               <l>Whether it were his <hi>Phyſick,</hi> or his <hi>Food.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Prais'd <hi>God</hi> for All; and for the ſharpeſt Pain:</l>
               <l>Thought nothing hard his <hi>God</hi> on him had lain.</l>
               <l>His Heart, in Praiſe, does flame, and nimbly run;</l>
               <l>And the great Work of <hi>Heaven</hi> had begun.</l>
               <l>Thus practiſing the Glorious Notes above;</l>
               <l>And learning the <hi>Seraphick</hi> Song of Love.</l>
               <l>His Joys were ſolid, and no idle Dreams:</l>
               <l>As he did, warns us to avoid Extreams.</l>
               <l>Bleſſings, when here poſſeſs'd, (our Nature's ſuch)</l>
               <l>We prize too little; when they're gone, too much.</l>
               <l>His Soul releas'd, flew up to <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Arms;</l>
               <l>Where now ſecure from Sorrow, Sin, or Harms:</l>
               <l>Encompaſs'd round with unconceived Bliſs:</l>

               <l>Mean while, his Soul with Joys, Immortal, Crown'd;</l>
               <l>In Streams profound, of endleſs Pleaſures drown'd.</l>
