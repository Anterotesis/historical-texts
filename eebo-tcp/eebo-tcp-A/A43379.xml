            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Collection of ſome of the ſcattered Copies of Verſes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in various and perplexed times, by <hi>Edward</hi> Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> your late Grand-father, belongs of double right to your Lordſhip, as Heir and Executor: And had it been in his power t' have bequeath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Learning by Will, as his Library and perſonal Eſtate, it may be preſumed, he would have given it to you, as the beſt Legacy:
<pb facs="tcp:61557:3"/>
But Learning being not of our Gift, though of our Acquiſition, nor of the <hi>Parapharna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> of a Ladies Chamber, nor of the caſual and fortunate Goods of the World; it muſt be acknowledged of a tranſcendency beyond natural things, and a beam of the Divinity: For by the powers of Knowledge Men are not only diſtinguiſhed from Men, but carried above the reach of ordinary Perſons, to give Reaſons even of their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; not that Men believe becauſe they know, but know becauſe they believe; Faith muſt precede Knowledg; and yet Men are not bound t' accept matters of Religion (though Religion be th' object and employment of Faith, not of reaſoning) meerly without Reaſon and probable Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>That the learned Centuries are paſt, and Learning in declenſion, is too great a truth,
<pb facs="tcp:61557:3"/>
which may introduce Atheiſme with Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; for as Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion amongſt the Papiſts, ſo 'tis the Mother of Atheiſme amongſt th' Ignorant; The great and moſt dangerous deſign of our Church and National Enemies, is to make us out of love with Learning, as a Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick thing, and beneath the Spirits of the Nobility and of Princes: Whereas nothing improves and inlightens th' underſtandings of great Perſons, but Learning, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly innobles them far above their birth, but inables them t' impoſe on others, and to give, rather then take advice: The Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Generous, and Vertuous Perſon needs no Anceſtors; And what can ſo properly be call'd ours, as what is of our purchaſe? <hi>Gentiles agunt ſub nomine Chriſtiano,</hi> was an old Reproach upon the Primitive Chriſtians, and now Men out-act the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61557:4"/>The Goods of this life are all Hydropick, <hi>Quo plus bibuntur, plus ſitiuntur,</hi> Men are the dryer for drinking, and the poorer for covetouſneſs; no ſatiety, no fulneſs, but in ſpiritual things: The way of Vertue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to th' Heathen to be th' only way to Happineſs, and yet they knew not many Vertues which are the Glory of Chriſtianity, as Humility, Denying of our ſelves, Taking up the Croſs, Forgiving and loving our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, which th' Heathen took for follies rather then Vertues.</p>
            <p>As for Poetry it bears date before Proſe, and was of ſo great authority with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People and the wiſer ſort of Antiquity, that it was in veneration with their ſacred Writ, and Records, from which they derived their Divinity and belief concerning their Gods, and that their Poets, as <hi>Orpheus, Linus,</hi> and <hi>Muſaeus</hi> were deſcended of the
<pb facs="tcp:61557:4"/>
Gods, and divinely inſpired, from th' ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Motions of their Minds, and from the Relations of ſtrange Viſions, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures and Apparitions.</p>

            <l>After his death one Age? And keep unite</l>
            <l>That frame wherein our ſouls did ſo delight?</l>
            <l>For what are ſouls but love? Since they do know</l>
            <l>Only for it, and can no further go.</l>
            <l>Senſe is the Soul of Beaſts, becauſe none can</l>

            <l>And if ſouls be more where they love, then where</l>
            <l>They animate, why did it not appear</l>
            <l>In keeping him alive: Or how is fate</l>
            <l>Equal to us, when one man's private hate</l>
            <l>May ruine Kingdoms, when he will expoſe</l>
            <l>Himſelf to certain death, and yet all thoſe</l>
            <l>Not keep alive this Prince, who now is gone,</l>

            <l>This Prince, in whom we liv'd? that ſo we all</l>

            <l>So every praiſe, as if it took ſome foil,</l>

            <l>Such tearms, however elevate and high,</l>
