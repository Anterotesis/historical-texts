            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and collected into certain Rules which may discover all those Mysteries that are contained in that Science, by which a man may become an excellent Musician, and expert, both in the Theorical and Practical Parts thereof. To the Completeing of such forcible Rules I have contributed my Mite, whose Certainty and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity has been Experienced by divers, and may likewise be further known unto others, if they please or desire to understand them.</p>
            <p>I know that all <hi>Virtuoso's</hi> will encourage those things which conduce to the Improvement of any ingenious Art: but what shall be spoken against such things by persons rude, envious, or that do pass their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment rashly upon things which they know not, having neither seen, heard, nor understood them, is not to be valued. And I do assure my self that there is not any person in this Nation, that is a true Lover of this Science; or a Professour thereof, who does truely ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and understand this Art, but could cordially wish such an Improvement thereof, that those things which in Musick are concealed and mysterious, might be fully discovered: those which are imperfect, completed: those which are doubtful and disputable, cleared by evident Demonstration: those which are not to be done without great trouble, facilitated: those many Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations which burthen the Memory, made few and plain: and those whose Operation and Experience do's require the study and Expence of many years, might be performed without any difficulty in a few Weeks, or Months at the farthest. And that this way is found out and effected in a great measure, I say, many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Worth and Quality are able experimentally to testifie.</p>

                  <p>A Note is a signe of a present and posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive sound: and containeth Touch, and that either whole or not whole.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>A Pause is the Index of a privitive or absent Sound, that is of silence: and it answereth either to a <hi>Large,</hi> or <hi>Long,</hi> or <hi>Breve, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Signes of a broad sound, are a prick of Augmentation, breathing, and <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope:</hi> of which, <hi>Syncope,</hi> is a certain loosing of the Touch; Notes, or Pauses; breathing answereth a <hi>Semi Minim.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Signes of a Crasse Sound are parallel Lines, whereof the place and name do occur.</p>
                  <p>The place is a Musical System, and that greater or lesser.</p>
                  <p>The greater System for the most part doth consist of ten Lines: and serveth for the Composing of a Song, called other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a conjoyned System.</p>

And <hi>Plutarch</hi> doth accommodate the <hi>Greeks</hi> seven Vowels to so many Voices of Musick. 3. The <hi>Lyre, Cithren,</hi> and certain other musical Instruments which are strung with strings, were anciently of seven strings, without doubt, by reason of the seven Voices. The <hi>Chords</hi> of the <hi>Lyre</hi> were of old in this order, and by these Names, <hi>Hypate, Parhypate, Hyperme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, Mese, Paramese, Paranete, Ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For <hi>Hypatos</hi> as it were <hi>Hypertatos,</hi> doth signifie a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Eminency and Dignity. <hi>Nete,</hi> as <hi>Neate,</hi> that is, the last or ultimate.

Furthermore the Ancients did attribute the seven <hi>Planets</hi> to so many <hi>Chords</hi> of the <hi>Lyre,</hi> in this Order. To <hi>Saturn, Hypate:</hi> to <hi>Jupiter, Parhypate:</hi> to <hi>Mars, Hypermese:</hi> to <hi>Sol, Mese:</hi> to <hi>Venus, Paramese:</hi> to <hi>Mercury, Paranete:</hi> and to <hi>Luna, Nete.</hi> In which Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration the acutenesse and gravity of the <hi>Chords</hi> and <hi>Planets</hi> do respond exactly. Although others invert

the order, and attribute to <hi>Saturn Nete,</hi> and to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Hypate.</hi> Which Comparation although it may consist: Yet notwithstanding the first is more allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: because <hi>Saturn</hi> doth proceed in a mundane mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion most quickly, <hi>Luna</hi> most slowly. Look <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Dream. From the <hi>Chords</hi> to the Notes we transfer this Comparation, and ascribe to <hi>Luna, vt</hi>; to <hi>Mercury, re</hi>; to <hi>Venus, mi</hi>; to <hi>sol, fa</hi>; to <hi>Jupiter, la</hi>; to <hi>Saturn, bi.</hi> For surely as the <hi>Planet's</hi> do run round the Week, or the Septenary Circle of dayes in their Term or gliding Course, and each of them by a certain diurnal vicissitude of Government do's obtain the primacy: So these seven Notes do complete the universal harmonical <hi>Lection,</hi> divided by <hi>Musicians</hi> into seven Types. These Types are certain and appointed Progressions of Notes, distinguished by iudicial Letters. 4. These seven Voices do render all Musick very facile, aswell in the Theory as in the Practise, thus. All Musick is accomplished by <hi>Voices.</hi> The Voices being known, Notes are adhibited: To the Notes Characters of Letters; as appeareth by this <hi>Diagram.</hi>

the 1.5.8. The <hi>imperfect</hi> are those which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in <hi>Counterpoint,</hi> as the 3.6.10.

And this is the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Perfection.</hi> For although every Simple <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonancy</hi> is perfect in his degree; yet notwithstanding in respect of another, it is either more perfect or imperfect; yet so as the first and most perfect is the <hi>Octave,</hi> that compounded <hi>Unison</hi>; the most imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Ornaments</hi> of <hi>Crassitude</hi> have these <hi>Axioms.</hi> 1. <hi>Varietie</hi> should chiefly rule in an harmonical Song; I say varietie of <hi>Dyad's</hi> and <hi>Triads,</hi> more grave, more mean, more acute, simple and compounded, diffused and augmented, more perfect, and more imperfect, natural and fict. Hence is a various Licence: for in the <hi>Bass</hi> it is lawful to use the last and middle <hi>Monade</hi> of an <hi>Unitrisonous Radix</hi>: and <hi>Dyads</hi> prohibited, may antecede and follow one another; and a <hi>Dias</hi> and a <hi>Trias</hi> also <hi>anarmonical</hi> may be used.

When therefore in Singing some harsh sound is heard, which presently passeth into a sweet harmony, the hearing is therewith more affected, than if there were a current of perpetual Harmony. 2. When the whole harmonical Song is rendred more beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by the ornament of <hi>Celerity</hi> and <hi>Syncope</hi>; then chiefly the <hi>Close</hi> should be artificial. 3. <hi>Polyphony</hi> or multiplication of <hi>cardinal melodies</hi> do very much <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The material Affection of a Song, is that which floweth from the matter thereof. And it is a certain <hi>Genus</hi> of Modulation.</p>
                  <p>The formal Affection of a Song, is that which floweth from the Form there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: and is called a musical <hi>Trope</hi> or Mood; which is a Rule, according to which we direct the course of a Song.

But the <hi>Latines</hi> more narrowly considering the ascension and descension of every <hi>Tone,</hi> have constituted to every <hi>Mood</hi> a subjugal <hi>Mood</hi>; and those four they call <hi>Plagal</hi>; also subjugal, servile, and the like. And these descend more then the first. And hence arise the eight Moods, by which every Song is governed <hi>per Arsin &amp; Thesin,</hi> by rising or falling. But our Latter <hi>Musicians</hi> more diligently considering the variety of <hi>Tones,</hi> have constituted twelve legitimate <hi>Tones. viz.</hi> six Authent, and as many Plagal. For as there are six Voices. <hi>vt. re. mi. fa. sol. la.</hi> so also there are six Authent, and as many Plagal, which are vulgarly named by strange Names of Nations: I say, of those Nations who commonly were delighted with them. And to these twelve legimate Tones, two illegitimate were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Unto all which, various mixed Moods may be added. 5. <hi>An Authent Mood is primary, the Plagal secondary,</hi> and this doth not differ from that,

For in it there is a certain imitation of Celestial Harmony, by which as by a sweet and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Medicine, the Diseases of the mind are cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, Vices are dissipated, Cares are lessened: and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And in the end of the Chapter, he saith, <hi>that the</hi> Doric <hi>Musick hath respect unto Virtues, and divine Inspiration; and that it forceth men into Extasie of mind, and oblivion of the world; so that it driveth away evil Spirits, which he proveth by the Example of</hi> Saul. Lippius in his musical <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopsis,</hi> saith thus: <hi>the most natural and chief of all the Moods in these times, is the</hi> Ionic, <hi>with his secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary the</hi> Hypo Ionic.

of the Authent Moods is this.</hi> The <hi>Authent Mood</hi> hath his final Key in the <hi>Diapente</hi> below, and is divided harmonically. And that is called harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Division, where the <hi>Octave</hi> hath the <hi>Fifth</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the <hi>Fourth,</hi> thus; First the <hi>Ionic</hi> doth occur, which is by <hi>Lucian</hi> called <hi>Glaphyrus. i. e.</hi> pleasant: and by <hi>Apuleius</hi> wanton. And now it is much used. It runneth between <hi>C.</hi> and <hi>c.</hi> is divided in <hi>G.</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in <hi>c.</hi> In a flat Song it runneth between <hi>F.</hi> and <hi>f.</hi> and is divided in <hi>C.</hi> and endeth in <hi>f.</hi> It is most agreeable to <hi>Iambic's</hi> and <hi>Trochaic's.</hi> Then the <hi>Dorian</hi> Mood runneth between <hi>D.</hi> and <hi>d.</hi> and is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in <hi>a.</hi> ending in <hi>d.</hi> but raised, or in a flat Song, hath his course between <hi>g.</hi> and <hi>gg.</hi> and is divided in <hi>d.</hi> and endeth in <hi>gg.</hi> By <hi>Lucian</hi> it is called grave, and by <hi>Apuleius</hi> warlike. It is most fit to sing to he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Verse: for it hath wonderful Gravity with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacrity. The <hi>Phrygian</hi> Mood hath his course between <hi>E.</hi> and <hi>e.</hi> and is divided in <hi>mi</hi> which is in <hi>b.</hi> ending in <hi>e.</hi> In a flat Song it runneth between <hi>a.</hi> and <hi>aa.</hi> and is divided in <hi>e.</hi> and endeth in <hi>a a.

It is also <hi>Iambic</hi> and <hi>tragic</hi>; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting and ravishing the mind, putting it as it were out of it self, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, 8. <hi>pol. c.</hi> 5. and <hi>Plato</hi> 3. <hi>de Instit.</hi> The <hi>Lydian</hi> Mood doth take his course between <hi>F.</hi> and <hi>f.</hi> is divided in <hi>c.</hi> and endeth in <hi>f.</hi> in a flat Song it runneth between <hi>b.</hi> and <hi>bb.</hi> and is divided in <hi>f.</hi> and endeth in <hi>bb.</hi> It is harsh, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and merry.

That Division is by <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians</hi> called arithmetical, Where the <hi>Octave</hi> hath the fourth beneath the fifth; which is the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant.

                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> From the Organical Cause, <hi>Musick</hi> is vocal, instrumental, or mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. That is made by the voice of man, the next by divers Instruments, and this
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59254:52"/>
by the Uoice and Instrument together.</p>

                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> From Artifice, <hi>Musick</hi> is either Choral or Figural. That doth in his Notes observe an equal measure, and from the Author is called <hi>Gregorian:</hi> and this is either old or plaine.</p>
                  <p>This is such whose unequal Notes do vary their measure, and from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is called <hi>Ambrosian.</hi>

                     <head>3. Musical Instruments may conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently be reduced to these two kinds.</head>
                     <p>For some are called <hi>Pshelaphetus:</hi> and others are called <hi>Pneumatic:</hi> and these are called <hi>Crosta</hi>'s, which only by striking do make a Concent, and by others are called <hi>Entata.</hi> These are also called <hi>Emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neusta,</hi> and they are moved with the Fingers and Wind. Various kinds of Instruments are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under these. As the <hi>Whistle, Pipe, Cornet, Sackbut, Trumpet, Bagpipe,</hi> and the like, which are blown. Also the <hi>Clavichord, Psaltery, Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59254:53"/>
Cithren,</hi> and the like, which are struck with strings: So also the <hi>Lute, Harp, Lyre, Tabor,</hi> and other Instruments struck with strings. The <hi>Cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal, great Bell,</hi> and others struck with Brass. Also the musical <hi>Triangle</hi> struck with Iron or Steel. Or the Wooden <hi>Craticle</hi> (by the <hi>Germans</hi> called <hi>einstrofiedel' item ein holtzerngelachter)</hi> struck with Wood. And lastly the great Wind Instrument or <hi>Organ</hi> which is both blown and struck together. And here it will be necessary to lay down certain <hi>Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismes</hi> concerning musical Instruments. 1. <hi>The Canon, Mother, and Radix of all Instruments, is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nochord:</hi> which is an Instrument most simple, and intire, made of one or more <hi>unisonous Chords</hi>; and may be divided into how many, or how great parts you please, according to radical numbers by the <hi>biparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tripartition, quadripartition,</hi> &amp;c. thereof. And we may observe fully in this Instrument, all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of all musical numbers. And this will be the most simple Example of a <hi>Monochord,</hi> if you shall put one Chord upon a fit pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ce of Wood; into so many parts as you shall divide the Wood, certain Notes being added, so many distinct Sounds there will be, if you apply your finger to the Chord. 2. <hi>The Wooden Craticle is next in plainesse unto the Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chord.</hi> This is made ready without any trouble, if a Wooden stick being very drie, be proportionably divided into many parts; which according to the Order of Proportions, being bound together by links made of a string, do afford harmonical Sounds, if they be struck with a stick, and put to straw bound together. 3. <hi>The Lute is the chiefest of all Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59254:53"/>
of Musick.</hi> For no Invention of ancient or modern Musicians did ever make a more grateful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. 4. <hi>In Clavichords and the like Instruments there is the most evident Reason of the Scale of Musick.</hi> Those Instruments do consist of certain <hi>Tetrachords,</hi> which are double, ordinary, and extraordinary. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>Tetrachords</hi> are four. The first is called <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paton i. e.</hi> of greater and gravest Chords: from <hi>B.</hi> to <hi>E.</hi> and this is the <hi>Bass.</hi> The <hi>Second</hi> is <hi>Meson, i. e.</hi> of <hi>Means:</hi> from <hi>E.</hi> to <hi>a.</hi> and this is the <hi>Tenor.</hi> It is called <hi>Meson,</hi> because in old time when there were only three <hi>Tetrachords,</hi> (the <hi>Tetrachord Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perboloeon</hi> not being added) it was in the midst. The third is <hi>Diezeugmenon</hi> of distinct <hi>Chords,</hi> which is disjoyned from <hi>a.</hi> by a <hi>Tone,</hi> which is from <hi>b.</hi> to <hi>e.</hi> and this is the <hi>Altus.</hi> The fourth is <hi>Hyperboloeon i. e.</hi> of excellent or most acute <hi>Chords:</hi> from <hi>e.</hi> to <hi>aa.</hi> and this is the <hi>Discantus.</hi> The extraordinary <hi>Tetrachord</hi> is <hi>Synemmenon. i. e.</hi> of connexed Chords; so called because it is joyned with <hi>a.</hi> and it extendeth from <hi>a.</hi> to <hi>d.</hi> There is also a threefold progression of these <hi>Tetrachords,</hi> viz. <hi>diatonic, enharmonic,</hi> and <hi>chromatic.</hi> The <hi>diatonic</hi> progression is by a <hi>Ditonus</hi> and lesser <hi>Semitone.</hi> The <hi>enharmonic</hi> by a <hi>Ditonus</hi> and two <hi>Dieses, viz,</hi> the greater and lesser <hi>Diesis. i.e.</hi> the half of the lesser <hi>Semitone.</hi> And the <hi>chroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic</hi> progression is made by the <hi>Semiditone,</hi> and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and lesser <hi>Semitones. (vide triple Scale chap.</hi> 5.) This Doctrine will be clearer, if the Doctrine of Sounds, or musical Intervalls, or Moods (as they vulgarly call them) be rightly propounded. For there are in all Ten Moods according to a known
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59254:54"/>
Song. <hi>The Moods are three times three, and one, by which every Song is made.</hi> sc. <hi>The Unison, Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone, Tone, Semiditone, Ditone, Diatessaron, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apente, Semitone with a Diapente, Tone with a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pente, Diapason.</hi> And whosoever shall diligently consider these Moods, shall easily know the <hi>Ration</hi> of musical <hi>Intervalls,</hi> and so of all <hi>Harmony.</hi> And the Artificial Division of these Moods is this. A <hi>Mood,</hi> or rather a Sound, is an Intervall or Distance from another, and that is either equal or unlike. An equal <hi>Mood</hi> is that which is in the same Degree, and is called the <hi>unison</hi> or <hi>Basis.</hi> Also an <hi>Unison</hi> is the conjunction of two or more Notes in the same place. <hi>c. gr.</hi> if <hi>sol</hi> be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>epeated in the same Key, or <hi>la,</hi> the <hi>Mood</hi> is unlike, in which there is both <hi>Arsis</hi> and <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis. i. e.</hi> Elevation and Demission of the Sound. And this is either continued or interrupted. A continued Sound is a <hi>Tone</hi> or <hi>Semitone.</hi> A <hi>Tone</hi> is the skipping of a Voice from a Voice by a perfect Second sounding strongly. Hence it is called a Second. In the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of six musical Voices, every next is distant from his next by a <hi>Tone. e. gr. vt re.</hi> except <hi>mi fa</hi> joyned together; which Connexion is called a <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone,</hi> which is the skipping of the Voice into a Voice by an imperfect Second, sounding flatly: as is the Leaping from <hi>mi</hi> into <hi>fa,</hi> and again from <hi>fa</hi> into <hi>mi. scil.</hi> the next. By the <hi>Greeks</hi> it is called <hi>Hemitone:</hi> and by <hi>Musicians</hi> the lesser <hi>Semitone.</hi> The inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Mood is discrete by certain Intervalls. The first is <hi>Diaphonus,</hi> as the <hi>Ditonus</hi> and <hi>Semiditonus.</hi> The <hi>Ditonus</hi> is a sharp and perfect third: and doth consist of two <hi>Tones,</hi> as is between <hi>vt mi. fa la.</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59254:54"/>
called the <hi>Third.</hi> The <hi>Semiditonus</hi> is the Intervall of the Voice from a Voice by a flat and imperfect Third As between <hi>re fa. mi sol.</hi> The Second is <hi>Paraphonus.</hi> As a <hi>Diatessaron</hi> and a <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pente.</hi> A <hi>Diatessaron</hi> is the leaping from a Voice into a Voice by a fourth. As is between <hi>vt fa. re sol.</hi> and <hi>mi la.</hi> otherwise called a fourth. The <hi>Diapente</hi> is the skipping of a Voice from a Voice by a Fifth: called vulgarly <hi>Quadrimode</hi> and <hi>Quinta.</hi> As be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>vt sol. re la. mi mi. fa fa.</hi> And again a Fifth is either compounded with a <hi>Tone</hi> or a <hi>Semitone.</hi> Hence a <hi>Tone</hi> with a <hi>Diapente</hi> is a perfect Sixth, as is between <hi>vt</hi> from <hi>c</hi> to <hi>la</hi> in <hi>a.</hi> The <hi>Semitone</hi> with a <hi>Diapente</hi> is the imperfect <hi>Sixth.</hi> As between <hi>mi</hi> from <hi>e</hi> to <hi>fa</hi> in <hi>c.</hi> and contrarily. The Third is <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiphonus.</hi> as the <hi>Diapason:</hi> which is the Distance of a Voice from a Voice by an Eighth; whence it is called an <hi>Octave.</hi> And it is made seven wayes <hi>i. e.</hi> from every Letter to his like; as from <hi>A</hi> to <hi>a.</hi> from <hi>a</hi> to <hi>aa.</hi> &amp;c. To these <hi>Moods</hi> or <hi>Intervalls</hi> there are four prohibited <hi>Intervalls</hi> opposed by vulgar Musici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. 1. A <hi>Tritone</hi> which containeth three <hi>Tones,</hi> and is made from <hi>fa</hi> to <hi>mi.</hi> 2. A <hi>Semidiapente</hi> which passeth from <hi>mi</hi> to <hi>fa.</hi> containing two <hi>Tones</hi> and as many <hi>Semitones.</hi> 3. A <hi>Semidiapason,</hi> which is an <hi>Octave</hi> containing three <hi>Semitones</hi> and four <hi>Tones,</hi> reaching from <hi>mi</hi> to <hi>fa.</hi> 4. A <hi>Disdiapason,</hi> which is an <hi>Intervall</hi> by a Fifteenth; within which there is a Limit appointed to the Voice: beyond which it may not wander; and if it wander it is but feigned; For if more Distances then a <hi>Diapason</hi> occur, they will equisonate with the former <hi>Distances</hi> in the <hi>Octave.</hi>
