            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Proverbe is true &amp; common: That, which is meat for one, may be poiſon for another: for without doubt, all things are not fit for all men; &amp; therefore it concernes them much, to know their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inclination, &amp; follow it, if juſt &amp; orderlie, in their attire, diet, exercices &amp; worldlie Vocations. But in matters of ſalvation, &amp; in respect of that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, faith, love &amp; works, which are requir'd of a Chriſtian in years of diſcretion: then certainly, what is meat for one muſt be meat for all; fith the ſame things are neceſſarie to all men, by which one muſt be ſav'd. Let then everie man looke on this <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> as on a thing as fit for him, as for my Wife &amp; two Children. If this hath a faire &amp; publick regard, my Catechiſme &amp; other books ſhall (by Gods helpe) ſhortly follow.

This is my hope and pray'r for thee. But becauſe this converting Word is not often preacht ſo fully &amp; diligently, as I wiſh; our old men being commonly in manie places of this Land, babes in knowledge, and Children in Chriſtian wiſdome: leſt thou ſhould'ſt want that neceſſarie food, for thy ſoules everlaſting life; here is, my Love, here is a help, to know that God, to whom this day, thou haſt vow'd Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.

<pb facs="tcp:169468:4"/>
conſolation and ſalvation. Receive it courteouſly, Deare Babe; caſt on it thy mild lookes; take it with thy litle fingers; kiſſe it with thy ſoft, ſweet, ſucking lips; and hereafter eſteeme it above all riches, &amp; keep it as thy life. 'Tis thine, &amp; made for thee, although I ſay, it is likewiſe made for others, thy vertuous and beauteous Mother, thy wittie and prettie Siſter. Thou maiſt hereafter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, Knowledge is like the Sunne, which caſts his beames abroad, and yet looſes no light: Or like a Torch, at which millions may be lighted, without prejudice to anie, or to it ſelfe: for, light and heat are common unto all bodies, and given all to all. In giving Inſtructions, that, which I give, remaines with me; and although all the world divide my gift, yet each man may receive it whole. Thinke not therefore this Booke leſſe thine; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe compoſed for others: but rather indeavour, to make it truly thine, by diligently learning it, and heartily beleeving, boldly profeſſing, faithfully practiſing that ſound Faith, and thoſe pious Works, I have taught thee in it and in my Catechiſme, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to thy faire and loving Siſter, which I give thee likewiſe. And when thus thou haſt made them thine, hide not thy light, my Deare; burie not thy talent: but as a Sunne, impart thy light and heat to thy friends, nighbours, yea all men, with whom thou ſhalt converſe. Let it be thy daily ſtudie &amp; holie ambition, to doe well to all men; ſo behaving thy ſelfe, that by thy vertuous examples, Chriſtian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and friendlie admonitions, no man goe from thee without gaine.

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ith the Juſt ſhall live by his Faith, I hope, no man can juſtly condemne me, for the preſent Declaration of mine. He may rather greatly praiſe me, who knowes, that the juſt man muſt wiſely examine his Heart, to ſee, what Faith he hath, what he Beleeves to Righteouſnes; and then boldly open his Mouth, to Confeſſe it to Salvation, if it be ſuch, as may worke both, a true, livelie, ſtrong Faith; by which he wholly relies on Gods free mercie, through the onelie merits of Chriſt, for his Juſtification and Glorification. Fearing therefore no condemnation of the wiſe, yet not challenging their commendation, my pen hath writ in this paper what Gods finger hath graven in my Heart, and ſhall (I hope) bring thence into my Mouth, when his glorie ſhall require it, to the loſſe of my goods, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, libertie, life. How ſoone this may be, I know not: but I ſee, this is a fit time, to trie each mans Faith and courage: for now Diviſions reigne 'mongſt us, yea over us, and are ſo ſtrong, ſharpe, hot; that they like mightie Rocks, ſuppreſſe all rights; like two-edg'd Swords, cut aſunder thoſe bonds, God and nature have made to unite men; and like a raging Fire, burne and conſume this once rich and glorious Countrie. Leaſt then by the furie of theſe unhappie Diviſions, and moſt incivill civill Warres, that Faith be chang'd, that Religion exil'd, which (by the Lords grace) I Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe: I have thought expedient, to leave my Beleefe in writing, for helpe to my Poſteritie; that ſo my Wife and Children may find here what a Kingdom may looſe, and is worth more then all the World. If it be ſaid, that there are other Confeſſions, to direct my
<pb facs="tcp:169468:5"/>
Children in the right pathes of Faith: I will anſwer, that ſuch indeed leade into pathes of Faith; but that theſe pathes being in my conceit too ſtrait, I have made them here a hie Way, and a broad Road, which being well follow'd, ſhall doubtles leade them to Heaven. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though perhaps I differ from other Proteſtant Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefes: yet my Confeſſion being built on a ſure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, the written Word of God, it may be a ſafe guide. But that diverſitie of opinions ſhould breed no doubts in Religion, it is my heartie wiſh and pray'r, that we be all of one mind in the Lord. Yet becauſe this is difficult, I will here adde, that my difference from other Proteſtants conſiſting in omiſſions, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, or additions; my Children muſt well examine theſe three points in particular. And to helpe them in their judicious diſcuſſion, I tell them now generally; that if they find, I omit or oppoſe what in other mens Confeſſions wants good authoritie, being not grounded on Gods Word, they ſhall doe well, both to approve my omiſſions, and ſtand with me, in ſuch oppoſitions. Concerning additions, theſe conſiſting either of matters or Articles; if the firſt are godlie, yea neceſſarie to be knowne, let my wiſe Iſſue eſteeme them, above all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of treaſure: and if (as 'tis likewiſe) in the ſecond; concerning their number, which exceedes all other Beleefes; then let them thinke, I have made ſo manie, that for their brevitie, they be learnt with facilitie: for being ſhort, they may like fine morſels, eaſily be chew'd, eat, digeſted; the ſhorteſt containing ſome point, and manie of them more. And as eating a bit, provokes often the appetite for more: So that who hath learn't one Article of my Beleefe, may have a deſire to learne more, I have linkt them all together, often grounding the following, on the bodie or matter of the preceding. And if this, with their great number of hundred and three ſcore, ſhall notwithſtanding the brevitie of each, make
<pb facs="tcp:169468:6"/>
them ſeeme long and tedious, yet hard to be learnt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out booke, by my Children, who ſhall perhaps have but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie wits: my anſwer is; that if we had in writing all the Songs, Tales, Ridles, countrey-wenches can ſing and tell, although they cannot reade, and abound not in wit; it might appeare, this Confeſſion is not too long, for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of al thoſe, who inſtead of ſuch vanities, applie their minds to Religious ſtudies, and to whom it is freely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v'n, to know the myſteries, or ſecret things of Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. One thing more I ſuſpect, may be objected againſt me; that being but a privat man, tis preſumption in me, to make a publick Confeſſion: and to ſuch I anſwer, that though I have no office in the Church or State; yet as I am a Husband and Father, I am a publick man, and ſo have juſt authoritie, to publiſh and declare my will to thoſe, who are ſubject to it, and to them manifeſt my Faith, to whom I owe oeconomique, politique and Religious inſtructions. Beſides, this objection might be as good, againſt the firſt framers of thoſe Beleefes and Confeſſions of Faith, the <hi>French, Germans</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> have: for, I ſuppoſe, they were contriv'd by ſome particular perſons, who though Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops or Miniſters, had yet no more authoritie, then I, to impoſe them upon the Church of God. But as thoſe were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by generall conſent, ſo mine may be, and from privat become publick, and from proper, common, at leaſt to my Wife &amp; Poſteritie, who in it and my Catechiſme ſhall (I hope) find all knowledges neceſſarie to their eternall Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Intending to leave them both Catechiſme and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion, and this being made laſt, I have either omitted, or lightly handled manie points, which are ful in my Catechiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. Let then one book help the other, &amp; both ſhew my Wife &amp; Children all neceſſarie truths, for their perfection &amp; fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie. Yet leaſt my bookes ſhould not be ſufficient, to make them perfect in the Lord; let them frequently reade, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſtudie, and ſeriouſly meditate the Scriptures, which are able, to make them wiſe to Salvation.</p>

I Beleeve, that in this Eſſence, ſubſtance, or Nature, there are three diſtinct Perſons, compleat and rationall, each ſubſiſting and living of it ſelfe, having indiviſibly the whole divine ſubſtance: all equall in eternitie, infinitie, wiſdome, power, juſtice, will, &amp;c. Yet diſtinguiſht among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by their order, names, internall actions, and manner of working externally.</p>
            <p n="3">III. I Beleeve, that God the Father is the firſt Perſon of the three, not in time, dignitie, power,
<pb facs="tcp:169468:7"/>
or the like: for in the three Perſons, ther's no prioritie of time, no diſtinction of pow'r, no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of will, no diverſitie of wiſdome, juſtice, mercie, goodnes, &amp;c. but becauſe his being and beginning are of himſelfe; and that the Father is in order before the Son, to whom he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates his whole divin Eſſence, by an eternall and incomprehenſible Generation; and with him to the holie Ghoſt, by a Spiration or Breathing, which is likewiſe eternall &amp; incomprehenſible: ſo that the Father is the eternall begining &amp; fountaine of the Trinitie, &amp; likewiſe of all externall actions, as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, Reprobation and Creation; working in theſe, which regard the Creatures, by the Son and the holie Ghoſt.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I Beleeve, that the Word is the ſecond Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the onelie naturall Son of the Father, the brightnes of his glorie, and the expres Image of his Perſon, eternally engendred by him, and ſo having the whole divin Eſſence of the Father, with whom eternally he produces the holie Spirit, by whom he workes externally from the Father.</p>
            <p n="5">V. I Beleeve, that the holie Ghoſt is the third Perſon of the Deitie, eternally and equally procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the Father and Son, yet not as from two beginnings, but as from one onely, being in two Perſons: and ſo having the whole divin Eſſence, by an eternall ſpiration from both, from whom he workes externally.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. I Confeſſe, that when I ſpeake of beginning in the Perſons of the God-head I ſpeake after the manner of men, and according to our capacitie: for, I Beleeve, that being eternall, they can have no beginning, as we conceive a beginning, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of time, dayes houres, minutes, moments.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. And although this Eternitie &amp; manie other
<pb facs="tcp:169468:7"/>
things in God, as the Trinitie of Perſons in the Unitie of Eſſence, the Generation of the Word, Spiration of the holie Ghoſt, and Divin Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties or Attributes, as Infinitie, Omniſcience, Omnipotence, Mercie, Juſtice; be much above reaſon and all human apprehenſion: yet I Doubt not of the truth thereof; but with an humble and ſtrong Faith, ſay to that Eternall, Infinit, All know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Almightie and Incomprehenſible Spirit: thou art my God, becauſe I cannot conceive thee.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. I Beleeve, that there is no Diviſion of the Eſſence, nor confuſion of the Perſons: for the Eſſence or Being, Nature, Subſtance is ſo whole in all the Perſons; that they are all but one and the ſame ſubſtance, and ſo but one indiviſible God: and the Perſons are ſo diſtinct in their Order, Names and incommunicable Proprieties, as theſe are particular and Perſonall: that the firſt cannot be the ſecond; nor the Son, the Father; nor the holie Ghoſt, either of theſe, begetting or being begotten: and therefore.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. I Beleeve, that the Father and firſt Perſon of the Deitie hath Being of himſelfe: neither made, nor created, nor begotten, nor proceeding; but begetting his Son, and with him producing or ſending forth the holie Ghoſt.</p>
            <p n="10">X. I Beleeve, that the Son and ſecond Perſon is neither made, nor created, nor proceeding: but begotten eternally by the Father, with whom he ſends forth the holie Ghoſt</p>
            <p n="11">XI. I Beleeve, that the holie Ghoſt and third Perſon is neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but eternally proceeding from the Father and Son.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. I Beleeve, that though the three Perſons be diſtinguiſht among themſelves and knowne to us, by the names of Father or firſt, Son or ſecond,
<pb facs="tcp:169468:8"/>
Holie Ghoſt or Third: yet the names, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Divin Eſſence, as <hi>Jehova,</hi> Lord, God &amp; the like, are common to the three Perſons: ſo that I call the Father, God; the Son, God, &amp; the holie Spirit, God: and ſay alſo, that God is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; &amp; God, the Son; &amp; God the holie Ghoſt: yet acknowledge, admire &amp; adore but one God, one in Nature, three in Perſons, who differ really each from other, in their particular &amp; Perſonall Proprieties but from the Eſſence, onely formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by divers manners or faſhions of ſubſiſting.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. So that in th'Unitie of the God-head, I Beleeve a Pluralitie, not Eſſentiall, nor Accidentall; but onely Perſonall. Not Eſſentiall, becauſe the Deitie is a moſt ſimple Eſſence: nor Accidentall, for, God admits no accidents nor compoſition, being a moſt pure act: neither are the Perſons compounded, as if they were a thing and another thing, or part of the God-head: but they are the Divine ſubſtance, and three ſubſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or manners of being.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. I Beleeve, that whatſoever is in God, is God, becauſe there is nothing in God, which be not properly the Eſſence or Perſons. Therefore, all Gods Attributes or Proprieties belong to the Eſſence, without diviſion; and to each perſon, with the limitation or diſtinction of perſonall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie. I ſay therefore, that Wiſdome is Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to the Deitie, yea Deitie it ſelfe; and that it is in the Father, Wiſdome begetting; in the Son, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome begotten; in the holie Ghoſt, Wiſdome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding: and upon this ground.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. I Beleeve, that the Eſſence being moſt ſimple, and which admits no diviſion; the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall proprieties of God differ not truly from the Eſſence, nor from themſelves, but onely in our
<pb facs="tcp:169468:8"/>
conception, which being weak, and our underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding finit, borrows the aſſiſtance of manie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct acts, thoughts, ſights, to know in part the incomprehenſible God.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. To ſpeak then properly, I Beleeve and Confeſſe, that there are not in God manie Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes (except the Perſonall proprieties of beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, &amp;c.) but one onely, which is th'Eſsence it ſelfe; by which God is Eternall, Great, Wiſe, Juſt, &amp;c. and ſo Eternitie it ſelf, Power, Wiſdome, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, &amp;c. yet ſo that <hi>I</hi> conceive not, that his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Juſtice, Love and Hatred, &amp;c. differ in themſelves, and from God: for, they are but one thing in God, or rather they are God himſelfe: for,</p>
            <p n="17">XVII. I Beleeve, that Gods Eſſentiall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties are in him, neither quantities, nor qualities of the divine Eſſence, nor accidents in that Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but his whole and onelie Eſſence: for, God admits no quantitie, by which he may be ſaid to be ſo much and ſo much; nor qualitie, by which he be ſaid ſuch and ſuch: but whatſoever God is, he is ſuch onely by Eſſence; great, without quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie; good, without qualitie.</p>
            <p n="18">XVIII. I Beleeve, that according to our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion and to the truth it ſelfe, wee may call the Father Eternall, Infinit, Omnipotent, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, Juſt, Wiſe, and the like; and ſo likewiſe the Son and holie Ghoſt: yet we muſt not, and I doe not beleeve three Eternall, Infinit, Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, Immutable, True, Wiſe Gods or Eſſences: but one onely Eternall, Infinit, Omnipotent, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie God or Eſſence.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. I Beleeve, God hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated &amp; ſtil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates ſome of his Proprieties, both to Angels and Men, as juſtice, holines, wiſdom, pow'r, &amp; the like, in a wiſe proportion to their capacitie, &amp; regard
<pb facs="tcp:169468:9"/>
of his own glorie: but there are ſome ſo eſſentiall and proper to the Deitie; that he will not, and ſo cannot communicate them to the creature: as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie, Simplicitie, Infinitie, Omniſcience, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence: for thus he ſhould deſtroy the nature of the creature, and make her a God, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the incommunicable divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, in whieh, or rather which thoſe Proprieties are.</p>
            <p n="20">XX. By Gods Eternitie, I conceive in part, &amp; Beleeve wholly &amp; perfectly that Being, he hath of himſelf, free from mutation &amp; paſſion, without beginning &amp; end of time, &amp; without ſucceſſion of firſt and laſt, paſt &amp; future: in whom all other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings doe begin: who gives to all life &amp; breath &amp; all things: in whom we live &amp; move: of whom, through whom, &amp; for whom are all things.</p>
            <p n="21">XXI. By Gods Simplicitie, I conceive &amp; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve likewiſe his pure Eſſence, void of compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, diviſion, multiplication: for, God is not compounded of matter &amp; forme, nor of gender and difference, nor of ſubſtance and accidents, nor of anie parts or things, ſenſible, or intelligible: but whatſoever God is, he is the ſame eſſentially, all things being but one in him, which in creatures are divers. And the Trinitie of Perſons hinders not this Simplicitie: for, God is three, by coex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of Perſons, not by compoſition of parts.</p>
            <p n="22">XXII. By Gods Infinitie, I conceive the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſitie of Gods Eſſence, void of meaſures, limits or bounds, being all in himſelf, all in all things, all in everie thing, &amp; all without all things: fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling &amp; containing all things, yet being contained by none: moving the world, and yet being without motion: for, what is infinit hath no motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. And this Infinitie is that, we call Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb facs="tcp:169468:9"/>
&amp; Ubiquity, by which the Deity is every wher.</p>
            <p n="23">XXIII. By Gods Omniſcience, I underſtand that one eternall, infinit, ſimple &amp; perfect act or ſight, by which God comprehends himſelf, as an infinit object, and by himſelf knows all things, paſt, preſent, future; paſt and future to us, but all ever preſent to him.</p>
            <p n="24">XXIV. By Gods Omnipotence, I conceive that moſt ſimple and perfect act, by which he's in himſelf able to doe whatſoever he will; ſo that no Creature can reſiſt his Pow'r, which hath no limits but his Will.</p>
            <p n="25">XXV. Gods Eſſence being ſimple &amp; true, can admit no contrarietie, or falſitie: &amp; therefore I Beleeve, that God will not, &amp; ſo cannot doe things contradictorie, as to make a man unreaſonable, or a bodie without its length, breadth, depth: for, this ſhould be bodie &amp; no bodie; &amp; the other, man &amp; no man.</p>
            <p n="26">XXVI. I Beleeve &amp; Confeſſe, that God can (if he will) doe manie things more, then he hath done: as, to Create new Worlds, and likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy his own works: yet from his infinit power, nothing muſt be affirm'd, as done, or to be done, unles his Will be prov'd.</p>
            <p n="27">XXVII. By Gods Will, I Conceive that moſt ſimple, infinit, perfect act, by which he eternally Will himſelf, &amp; all things for himſelf: ſo that God hath not two, nor contrarie Wills; but one onelie, conſtant &amp; immutable: yet to help our weaknes, in the imperfect conception of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible God, we have manie nominall, but not reall diſtinctions of Gods Will, &amp; chiefely ſoure: the VVill of Good Pleaſure &amp; of Signe, Abſolut &amp; Conditionall.</p>
            <p n="28">XXVIII. By the VVill of Signe, I underſtand
<pb facs="tcp:169468:10"/>
thoſe meanes, by which God manifeſts what is pleaſant or diſpleaſant to him, as his injunctions &amp; prohibitions, promiſes &amp; threatnings. And ſo I call both Teſtaments, the VVill of Signe, or the Revealed VVill: becauſe we ſee in them what is ſecret and hid in God.</p>
            <p n="29">XXIX. By the VVill of Pleaſure, I Conceive Gods onely VVill, by which he moſt freely &amp; for himſelf, eternally decrees what muſt be done. I ſay eternally: for, Gods VVill hath no firſt nor laſt: yet in reſpect of things decreed, God is ſaid, to have decreed, that they ſhould come to paſſe, in that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ſucceſſion, we ſee.</p>
            <p n="30">XXX. I Beleeve Gods VVill Abſolute, becauſe it is grounded on his ſole good Pleaſure, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends in no-wiſe upon things made or done in time: but is the Cauſe of whats'ever is made or done, of beings &amp; actions, yet not of the malice of the actions.</p>
            <p n="31">XXXI. And I call it Conditionall, becauſe Gods commandements &amp; prohibitions, promiſes &amp; threatnings have a condition of obedience or diſobedience joyn'd with them.</p>
            <p n="32">XXXII. I Beleeve, that God is ſo abſolut Lord and Maſter of the whole world, that nothing is, nor can be done againſt his free &amp; onelie will of Good-Pleaſure. For although manie things be done againſt the VVill of Signe; yet they are not, nor can be done, againſt the VVill of Good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: but all creatures are govern'd, &amp; all things doe happen, by &amp; according to the eternall will or Providence of God, which conſiſting not onely in knowledge, but alſo in government, thoſe verie things, which in reſpect of ſecond cauſes, we call Contingent, or of Chance, are moſt neceſſarie, &amp; ſo neceſſarily happen, in regard of Gods abſolute &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:169468:10"/>
immutable VVill: yet not by a neceſſitie of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, chiefly in the rationall creatures, but of immutabilitie.</p>
            <p n="33">XXXIII. As I Beleeve, there is a God, ſuch as I have deſcrib'd, yea, farre above all my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: So, I Beleeve in him, Father, Son, Holie Ghoſt, in the unitie of Eſſence, putting my whole confidence in his Name, for whatſoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes me, in goods, friends, reputation, bodie &amp; ſoule.</p>
            <p n="34">XXXIV. I beleeve, that the Name of God is admirable &amp; reverent: but by this word, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not onely thoſe Names, <hi>Jehova, God, Lord, Father, Chriſt, Saviour, Jeſus, Comforter,</hi> &amp;c. but the Divine Eſſence repreſented me by thoſe Names. I therefore tremble not, nor bow at the ſound, or ſight of thoſe Names: but I feare and adore the Majeſtie of God, his pow'r, wiſdome, juſtice, love and the reſt, which I conceive, in hearing or ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Names.</p>
            <p n="35">XXXV. I beleeve, that God being incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible to us, becauſe he's infinit, and we finit; &amp; there's no proportion of a finit to an infinit thing: he hath yet in ſome ſort reveal'd himſelf to man, in the Creatures &amp; Scripture: for, both in part declare his eternitie, wiſdom, power, goodnes and perfection. Then concerning the Creatures.</p>
            <p n="36">XXXVI. I beleeve &amp; Confeſſe, that God, to communicate his goodnes, &amp; for his will and good pleaſure, made immediatly by himſelfe, all things inviſible &amp; viſible: ſome of nothing, &amp; others of a matter alreadie created by him, but naturally unapt to produce the thing made thereof, firſt ſeparating that matter, then giving it a better forme, more perfection, &amp; greater Ornament.</p>
            <p n="37">
               <pb facs="tcp:169468:11"/>XXXVII. I Beleeve, that God, although wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nothing, as being a compleat eſſence; which can receive no perfection by the creature, did yet for his glorie &amp; praiſe, make all things for himſelf, &amp; for the good, helpe &amp; felicitie of the rationall creature, to which all other things, yea it ſelfe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the excellence of the maker.</p>
            <p n="38">XXXVIII. God being the ſoverain good I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that all his creatures were good &amp; perfect in their kind. I make not therefore two principles or beginnings of things good &amp; ill: for, theſe ill things were not ſo in themſelves, but verie good, for the uſe &amp; end, they were made.</p>
            <p n="39">XXXIX. I Beleeve, that the Trinitie did concurre in the Creation; the Father as the firſt cauſe of all things, making the World by the Son, who is his Word &amp; Wiſdom, &amp; by the holie Ghoſt, his power &amp; vertue. And all theſe three Perſons in one Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, I love, ſerve and adore, with equall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, fidelitie, reſpect &amp; feare.</p>
            <p n="40">XL. I Beleeve, that though the Heavens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the glorie of God, &amp; the whole world be a faire glaſſe, to behold therein his greatnes, wiſdom, goodnes, &amp;c. Yet Angels and Men onely were made in Gods Image; &amp; hereupon.</p>
            <p n="41">
               <hi>XLI.</hi> I Conceive &amp; Beleeve, that this Image was not in the ſhape of mans bodie: for, Angells are but Spirits, &amp; God himſelfe hath no bodie: though the Scripture for our capacitie ſpeakes of Gods eyes, eares, hands, to ſhew, he knowes all, can do all. Seeking then that Image of God in man, I find it chiefly in the Soules inviſible &amp; immortall ſubſtance, having a wiſe underſtanding, &amp; this with the will &amp; memorie, yea with the whole bodie, juſt &amp; upright; beſides that Majeſtie and pow'r over all theſe inferiour creatures, by which he was
<pb facs="tcp:169468:11"/>
Gods lieutenant on earth, &amp; ſo repreſented him in ſome ſort, above all the reſt.</p>
            <p n="42">
               <hi>XLII.</hi> I Beleeve, that Angels being all made in Gods Image, which conſiſted in their inviſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, immortalitie &amp; uprightnes, ſome fell volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily from God, &amp; others did remaine in their integritie, aſſiſted, &amp; confirmed in it by Gods grace in Chriſt, who is their Head, if not by redemption, yet by creation and Adoption, or gracious union with God: for, he's the Image of the inviſible God, &amp; the firſt borne of everie crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by whom &amp; for whom were created all things, in Heaven &amp; Earth, viſible &amp; inviſible; &amp; therfore without whom Angels nor Men, could be neither created in the Image of God, nor adopted for Sons.</p>
            <p n="43">
               <hi>XLIII.</hi> Angels being thus confirm'd in Gods grace &amp; eternall felicitie, I Beleeve them glorious, diligent, faithfull Miniſters of Gods will, for his glorie &amp; the good of his Church, &amp; faire miroirs of the riches of his mercie: wheras others, who fell, being confirm'd &amp; hardned in malice, doe what they can againſt that Church, being in their moſt wretched ſtate of everlaſting damnation, wofull ſpectacles of Gods juſtice &amp; anger towards ſin.</p>
            <p n="44">
               <hi>XLIV.</hi> I Beleeve, that <hi>Adam</hi> having a will free &amp; indifferent both to good &amp; evill, did willingly reject the firſt, &amp; embrace the ſecond: &amp; ſo forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king God, &amp; tranſgreſſing his law, which then he might have kept, if he had been willing; he loſt that integritie &amp; wiſdome, he was created in, &amp; that abſolute yet gentle pow'r, he had over theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour creatures; yea that immortalitie both of bodie &amp; ſoule, by which the bodie ſhould never have been forſaken by the ſoule, nor this deprived of Gods grace, which is her onelie Life.</p>
            <p n="45">XLV. I Beleeve, that as we were all in <hi>Adam,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:169468:12"/>
&amp; he did then repreſent us; ſo he loſt for us all what he loſt for himſelf. Therefore all his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (none excepted but Chriſt) are curs'd &amp; dead in him, being all guiltie of the ſins, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, in eating of the fruit prohibited by God, &amp; ſubject to his puniſhment. I ſay ſins in plurall: for, pride, incredulitie, murther, intemperance &amp; theft, did all concurre with his diſobedience.</p>
            <p n="46">XLVI. I Beleeve, that thoſe ſins having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the firſt mans perſon, &amp; his perſon corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his nature; this ſpreads her killing infection into all the perſons, which naturally deſcend from <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; by him, that is, by naturall generation: ſo that all ſuch perſons are ſhapen in iniquitie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in ſinne, &amp; thus defil'd and curs'd, both in ſoule &amp; bodie.</p>
            <p n="47">XLVII. I call this ſin Originall, beleeving it, a naturall &amp; ſtrong averſion from good, &amp; propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ill, an inbred luſt, deſire, concupiſcence, by which we will, act, or not act, in oppoſition to Gods Laws, &amp; the rules of reaſon: and ſo is the corrupt fountain of all our Actuall tranſgreſſions of the Lords Laws, in thoughts, affections, words, actions; yea, of our omiſſions of all holie duties.</p>
            <p n="48">XLVIII. I Beleeve that this ſin hath ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt our whole nature, that of our ſelves, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſpeciall grace of God, we can not think, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, love, fear, work, or ſpeak any thing, which be pleaſant to him.</p>
            <p n="49">XLIX. This ſin being the cauſe of all our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries; the breeder of our feares, cares, paines; the murderer of our ſoules and bodies: as I know, all men die bodily for it; ſo I judge them all damn'd, conſidering them all in <hi>Adam,</hi> guiltie of his diſ-o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: for, the wages of ſin is dead, both cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and ſpirituall: all ſins being of ſuch killing

nature, ſo mortall in themſelves, that the leſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves many deaths.</p>
            <p n="50">L. Yet I Beleeve, &amp; to the glorie of my Gods Mercie Confeſſe, that both Originall &amp; Actuall ſins are not imputed to all men, but by his moſt free gift pardoned to manie, who by this grace of Remiſſion of ſin, are delivered from that ſpirituall &amp; perpetuall death, by which the reſt of mankind is ſwallow'd.</p>
            <p n="51">LI. Thoſe bleſſed men, who obtain this gratuit pardon, I call Elect, &amp; thoſe wretched perſons, who miſſe it, Reprobat: the firſt being taken out of the generall &amp; ſinfull lump of naturall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Adam,</hi> by Gods eternall Election; and the ſecond left in the ſame, by his eternall Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</p>
            <p n="52">LII. Conſidering with feare and pitie, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſtate of theſe, and ſeeking earneſtly the Cauſe of their Reprobation, I finde it in Gods will. I Beleeve then, &amp; to the glorie of my Gods Juſtice, Confeſſe, that he decreed eternally, to Reprobat, reject, diſallow, or paſſe by ſome of mankind, which ſhould voluntarily fall into ſin, &amp; ſo damne them, to declare his Juſtice.</p>
            <p n="53">LIII. Thus I think not, that their Infidelitie or ſin foreſeen be the cauſe of their Reprobation: for thus we ſhould all be Reprobat: but I beleeve &amp; ſay again, that God was mov'd, to decree it, by his free &amp; juſt Will, being reſolv'd of the ſame lump, to make ſome veſſels to honor, &amp; others unto diſhonor; &amp; ſo as a great Lord, to furniſh his great houſe, with veſſels of all ſorts.</p>
            <p n="54">
               <hi>LIV.</hi> Yet I ſay not, that God made ſome men to be damn'd, although he did reprobat them: for, none is damn'd, as he is man, created in great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie; but as he is deform'd &amp; marr'd by his volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie
<pb facs="tcp:169468:13"/>
folie &amp; guilt: neither is dammation the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end of his Reprobation, or an effect of it; but is a meane, to manifeſt the glorie of the Lords Juſtice and his hate towards ſin, in the ſevere &amp; everlaſting puniſhments, he inflicts on ſinners.</p>
            <p n="55">LV. Theſe puniſhments being the fit wages of ſin, &amp; this ſin moſt voluntarie in the Reprobat, conſid'red in themſelves, who daily &amp; wilfully ſin, &amp; in <hi>Adam,</hi> whoſe fall was free: they have no juſt ground to complaine of God, as if he were the cauſe or author of their ſin, which I Beleeve, he's not, but rather hates &amp; forbids it. For though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbeare ſin, but much delight in it, &amp; commit it with greedines: yet</p>
            <p n="56">LVI. I Beleeve, that ſin is not prompted to them, nor forc't on them by God, but by the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of the Devill, &amp; corruptions of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: &amp; God is not oblig'd to ſtrengthen them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe tentations &amp; depravation; but may juſtly denie to them, or withdraw his graces from, them, &amp; give them up to their hearts luſts, &amp; Satans pow'r: neither likewiſe was he oblig'd, to hinder <hi>Adams</hi> fall; but might, &amp; did moſt juſtly permit &amp; decree it; not as a ſin, but as a meane to manifeſt his mercie &amp; juſtice: mercie to few, &amp; juſtice to manie.</p>
            <p n="57">LVII. If my blind reaſon ſhall dictat, that thus the Lord is hard, injuſt, partiall; Ile reprove it by this my firme Beleefe: that God owing nothing to man, no not the courſeſt bread, he eates, muſt not, cannot be accuſ'd of ſeveritie, injuſtice or partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: for, no man can pleade againſt God, nor the thing form'd, ſay to him, who form'd it; why haſt thou made me thus? We were all in Gods pow'r, as the clay in the Potters hands, fit to be made veſſels to ſuch uſes &amp; ſervices, as our Lord &amp;

maker thought beſt, for the revelation of his wiſdome, power, mercie, juſtice.</p>
            <p n="58">LVIII. If then God lov'd <hi>Jacob,</hi> &amp; hated <hi>Eſau,</hi> before they were borne, and had done either good or ill; it is enough for me to know, 'twas his will, to doe ſo; and who can reſiſt or alter it, being almightie and immutable. And who dares cenſure it, being moſt juſt, yea the rule of juſtice? I dare not, will not, cannot find fault with the juſt and hie God, who hath mercie on whom he will, and hardens whom he will.</p>
            <p n="59">LIX. Although this word Harden ſeemes hard, yet I Beleeve, that there is no unrighteouſnes with God: for, he hardens but thoſe, who have hardned themſelves, by their wilfull abuſe of good motions, predications, admonitions &amp; corrections: &amp; he hardens them not, by infuſing anie malice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hearts; but onely by a juſt deniall, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the graces, he owes them not, &amp; ſo by ſuffring them to follow their lewd inclinations, &amp; Satans wicked tentations. And this they doe ſo wilfully, eagerly, conſtantly; that as their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation is ſure &amp; immutable, in reſpect of Gods will, which can admit no change: ſo they make their damnation moſt certain, by their infidelitie and wickednes.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:169468:19"/>
the divers hearts of men: by the Satisfaction, they give faithfull readers, both in faith &amp; manners: by the accompliſhment of what is propheſi'd in them: by the conformitie of their writers, when they handle the ſame matters: by the conſent of the Jewiſh &amp; Chriſtian Churches: &amp; ſo being aſſur'd, that they are ſuch, doth ſhew, commend &amp; command them to all Chriſtians, in the name of her Lord &amp; Head.</p>
            <p n="100">C. I ſay, ſhe commands them in the name of her Lord: for though the Church ſhew me theſe Books, yet their authoritie is not from the Church, but from God, whoſe written Word &amp; will they are, ſo ſufficient &amp; full, that they are able, to make the man of God wiſe unto ſalvation, through faith in Chriſt Jeſus, perfect in all good workes.</p>
            <p n="101">CI. The Scripture containing Gods Covenant of favor &amp; bleſſings, both corporall &amp; ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, temporall and eternall, to his faithfull &amp; obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient people: I Beleeve, he was pleaſ'd, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme &amp; ſeale his gracious promiſes; leaſt anie man, whom they concerne, ſhould miſtruſt or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get them.

            <p n="102">CII. Theſe Sacraments being holie ſignes of Chriſt, muſt have from him inſtitution, promiſe of grace, matter &amp; forme, with the analogie or correſpondence betweene the element or ſigne, &amp; the thing ſignifi'd in ſome proprietie. I Beleeve
<pb facs="tcp:169468:19"/>
then, that Chriſt ordain'd the Sacraments, our holie Church hath now, appointing their matter &amp; forme, by which matter he repreſents the inward effects of his grace, promiſ'd to thoſe, who ſhall receive the ſigne, in faith, love, pur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p n="103">CIII. Chriſt being the ſubſtance, or inward matter of the Sacraments, is likewiſe th'inward Miniſter, giving or doing to the faithful ſoules what the ſignes doe to the bodies: for unto ſuch the ſignes are not naked; but with the ſignes they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt, with all his benefits, the merits of his life &amp; death: wheras the Reprobat, infidell, or wicked perſons being not of Gods election, &amp; ſo wanting the good diſpoſition, which is requir'd in all worthie Communicants, or partakers of Chriſts merits, receive the ſignes to their condemnation, miſſing the grace, which is not ty'd unto the ſignes, nor ſhut in them. For though the ſignes be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all the viſible members of the Church: yet the grace ſignify'd is proper to the ſole Elect; to whom onelie the Sacraments are moſt true Seales, aſſurance, meanes of Gods love towards them, in their Election, Vocation, Juſtification, Sanctification &amp; Glorification.</p>
            <p n="104">CIV. Conſidering them in this reſpect of Seales, aſſurance, meanes, not as Cauſes of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I eſteeme them greatly, yet never adore them: &amp; albeit the neglect of them be dangerous, yea damnable, becauſe ordain'd &amp; commanded by Chriſt: yet I beleeve, that God being not ty'd to the meanes &amp; ſecond cauſes, manie men may be, &amp; are ſav'd, without the Sacraments or ſignes; for Chriſt being th'inward matter &amp; Miniſter of them, may ſupplie the want of outward matter &amp; Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</p>
            <p n="105">CV. Whom I Beleeve to be onely the Stewards
<pb facs="tcp:169468:20"/>
of Gods myſteries, thoſe men, who are lawfully call'd, for the diſpenſation of their Lords Word &amp; Sacraments: yet I dive not into their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor conſider their worthines, for the efficacie of the Sacraments: but obſerving Chriſts Jnſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in their words &amp; actions, I relie on his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, for my preſent conſolation, &amp; future Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p n="106">CVI. The outward matter of the Sacraments being VVater, &amp; Bread and VVine are ſanctify'd by prayers &amp; the VVord of God, chiefly ſuch words as containe the Inſtitution of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: &amp; this Sanctification doth not conſiſt in an alteration of the ſubſtance or qualities of the elements, but in a change of their common uſe into a holie ſignification: for being thus Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd, or ſet a part, the water ſprinkled, the bread broken, &amp; the wine powr'd, both given, taken, eat, &amp; drunke, (which actions with the words of Chriſts Ordinance &amp; promiſes, are the formes of the Sacraments) they repreſent ſpirituall things under corporall ſhapes: the Water in Baptiſme ſignifying the waſhing of my ſoule, from all her filth &amp; ſins, by the bloud of Jeſus; &amp; the molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of my hard heart, by the pow'rfull graces of his ſpirit: &amp; the Bread &amp; Wine in the Lords Supper repreſenting my Spirituall nouriſhment, by the fleſh &amp; bloud of Jeſus, the merits of his life &amp; death.</p>
            <p n="107">CVII. And as this nouriſhment could not be repreſented by the ſignes, if their ſubſtance ſhould not remaine; I Beleeve &amp; Profeſſe, that the bread &amp; wine in the Lords Supper retaine their whole ſubſtance, as well as the water in Baptiſme: &amp; that it is againſt Scripture, reaſon &amp; the nature of Sacraments, to imagine anie ſubſtantiall
<pb facs="tcp:169468:20"/>
alteration or annihilation of the ſignes, in either of the Sacraments. Then to fancie in them a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall preſence of Chriſt, as is beleev'd by manie men, is likewiſe 'gainſt Scripture, reaſon and the nature of all bodies, although glorious: for not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their agilitie, impaſſibilitie &amp; glorie, they are and muſt bee finit, &amp; have their naturall length, breadth and depth.</p>
            <p n="108">CVIII. Theſe two, Baptiſme &amp; the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, alreadie named twice, are the onelie Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which I beleeve, Chriſt left unto his Church, to repreſent her ſpirituall generation and refection: for, the faithfull find truly in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception what the ſignes ſignifie, their new birth unto Chriſt, &amp; nouriſhment by him. Beſides theſe two, I Acknowledge &amp; receive no other.</p>
            <p n="109">CIX. Baptiſme being the firſt, not by its dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie: (for, they are both alike holie and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent:) but by reaſon of its inſtitution &amp; ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I Define it to be, a Sacrament, which by its matter applied with the forme repreſents &amp; ſeales unto us the remiſſion of ſins, mortification of the fleſh, renovation of the Spirit, and adoption in Chriſt: who infuſing his grace into our hearts, changes our carnall affections into ſpirituall, ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens our ſtonie hearts, purifies our corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p n="110">CX. Yet I ſay not, that theſe things be alwayes done in Baptiſme: for conſidering, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified &amp; in Gods covenant, before he had receiv'd the ſigne of Circumciſion, a ſeale of the righteouſnes of the faith, which he had, being yet uncircumcis'd: I Beleeve, that our Regeneration may be, &amp; is, wrought ſometimes before Baptiſme, in men of diſcretion, who have the right know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and faith in him, &amp; love to him;
<pb facs="tcp:169468:21"/>
and ſometimes long after Baptiſme: for, God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets us when he will, by the outward ſeed of his Word, &amp; the inward notions &amp; motions of his Spirit, and by degrees Sanctifies us.</p>
            <p n="111">CXI. As this Sacrament is the firſt viſible ſeale of Gods covenant it muſt not be denied them, who deſire it, if their knowledge, faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and good life declare them fit, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd into Chriſts flock. And ſince it is certain, that Gods promiſes made to us, belong likewiſe to our children, whoſe God he promiſes to be, whom Chriſt embrac'd and bleſt, teſtifying, that they have right in the Kingdome of heav'n: and ſince again, the Circumciſion of the Jews (which our Baptiſme ſucceeds) was ordained by God, even for babes of eight dayes old.</p>
            <p n="112">CXII. I Beleeve, all the children of them, who are probably thought to be in th' alliance of God, may well receive the ſigne and ſeale of that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, in which likewiſe they are; and the earneſt of that kingdome, which by the grace of God, and by vertue of his free promiſes, doth belong unto them.</p>
            <p n="113">CXIII. In the reception of this Sacrament, we give our names to Chriſt, &amp; become his Souldiers, to fight under his white Banners of love, humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſinceritie, truth, chaſtitie &amp; all vertues; againſt malice, hatred, pride, falſhood, luſt and the foule troupe of all vices, which warre 'gainſt us, under the black Standards of the Devill, the World and Fleſh. Albeit then I confeſſe, we deſerve death, to forſake Chriſts colors, and turn to his &amp; our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies: yet being graciouſly recall'd by him, if we return to him, &amp; by faith accept the pardon, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to ſinners,</p>
            <p n="104">CXIV. I Beleeve, that after Baptiſme, we may
<pb facs="tcp:169468:21"/>
Repent often, and be receiv'd into favor by him, who knowes what is in man, and how the wiſeſt erres, the ſtrongeſt falls, the holieſt ſinnes: and therefore aſſiſts his Elect, with ſuch effectuall grace, that they cannot have mortall falls, not commit the ſin unto death, that impudent, wilfull and conſtant oppoſition or deniall of the Lords truth, knowne by the teſtimonie of the holie Ghoſt, convincing mans rebellious heart.</p>
            <p n="115">CXV. Allowing Repentance, and knowing it neceſſarie, before the reception of either Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in men of diſcretion; I conceive it to be, a true ſorrow for all our ſins, begot in our hearts by Gods Spirit &amp; the filiall conſideration of the infinit Majeſtie of our gracious God and loving Father offended by our ſins, which we truly deteſt, reſolving ſeriouſly never to diſpleaſe our God willingly, but to ſerve him faithfully in all things, vowing to keepe his holie lawes, &amp; make to our neighbours all poſſible and due ſatisfaction or reſtitution of name, goods, loſſes, and to give them an information of the truth, if we have miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them; and withall begging Gods pardon, which we beleeve, he will grant for Chriſts ſake, &amp; for him freely granting ours to thoſe, who have offended us, although they doe not deſire it.</p>
            <p n="116">CXVI. Who by Gods ſpeciall grace hath this true Repentance, with a ſolid Knowledge of him, &amp; a right Faith of him, to him, in him; Beleeving what he is, hath reveal'd and promiſ'd, yea apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto himſelfe his gracious promiſes, &amp; wholly relying on them, may moſt comfortably receive both Sacraments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or having once receiv'd the firſt, be often admitted unto the participation of the ſecond; concerning which this is my Faith, that 'tis</p>
            <p n="117">
               <pb facs="tcp:169468:22"/>CXVII. A Sacrament, in which by Bread &amp; Wine God repreſents to us our ſpirituall &amp; perfect nouriſhment &amp; preſervation to eternall life, by Chriſts Bodie and Bloud; &amp; ſeales unto our ſoules his free &amp; frequent promiſes of remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſin, of everlaſting life, &amp; of his love &amp; protection, by the merits of his ſons obedience: for certainely, this Sacrament is a noble Token of Gods conſtant love towards us, a ſure Earneſt of his glorie, a knowne Seale of his promiſes, &amp; a faire Remembrance of the diſgraces, paines, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Chriſt endur'd in his life and death.</p>
            <p n="118">
               <hi>CXVIII.</hi> I ſay diſgraces, paines, torments: for, I Beleeve, that this Sacrament is a Memoriall of the humiliation, not of the glorification of Chriſt, whom then we conſider enduring, not reigning; in paines, not in pleaſures, in infamie, not in glorie: So that the breaking of the bread, and powring of the wine repreſent us the torments of Chriſts fleſh, &amp; the effuſion of his bloud; the firſt tortur'd, the ſecond ſhed, for the food of our ſoules.</p>
            <p n="119">CXIX. And thus are they made our Soules food. As we take bread and wine, &amp; our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſes ſee, feele, ſmell &amp; taſt but the ſignes, our ſoules behold the thing ſignified by them, the verie fleſh &amp; bloud of Chriſt, which then we eat and drinke, beleeving ſincerely, that by his paines, ignominies and righteouſnes, both in his life &amp; death; yea in his Sepulture, he made ſatisfaction to Gods juſtice for us, delivering us from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting death, &amp; purchaſing eternall life for us: &amp; in that faith, our ſoules live here, fat (as it were) by Chriſts merits, &amp; ſtrong with hope, to enjoy, his glorie.</p>
            <p n="120">CXX. 'Tis then onely by Faith, not by the
<pb facs="tcp:169468:22"/>
mouth of the bodie, that the Elect eat and drink the fleſh and bloud of Jeſus: for, his glorious bodie being in the higheſt Heaven, is not fit meat for our ſtomach: neither can it be preſent in, with, or under the ſignes, but by a Sacramentall ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I Beleeve then, that Chriſts Bodie is preſent but Sacramentally, by ſignification or repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſts effects, and of the merits of his whole humanitie, which then I ſee, take, eat by faith, the eye, hand and mouth of the Chriſtian Soule, applying that to me, which Chriſt acted and endured for me. For though Chriſt be not in the bread and wine, elſe Reprobat and Dogs might then eat him: yet</p>
            <p n="121">CXXI. I Beleeve, he's preſent in the Sacrament by his Divinitie, and there I adore him. He's there, by communication and a free grant of his merits; and by faith I doe embrace them. He is there, giving grace, and promiſing glorie; and I receive him beleeving. And ſince this Sacrament was ordained by him, under both kinds of bread and wine;</p>
            <p n="122">CXXII. I Beleeve, it muſt be adminiſtred &amp; receiv'd in both kinds, aſwell to ſignifie our perfect nouriſhment; as to refreſh in our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories the torments of Chriſts fleſh, and the effuſion of his bloud. I Eſteem then the deniall of the Cup, a Sacrilegious mutilation of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and a dangerous diminution of its ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification. And ſince the matter of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is appointed by Chriſt, and that they are intended to ſignifie our Spirituall generation and Refection, and to be likewiſe Remembrances of Chriſts life and paſſion;</p>
            <p n="123">CXXIII. I eſteeme them greatly abus'd, if mixt with any other matter, or adminiſtred &amp; receiv'd,
<pb facs="tcp:169468:23"/>
to anie other ends. The mixture then, or additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of oile and ſalt, with, or to the water in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: the Baptiſme of Bells: the celebration &amp; reception of the Lords Supper, in the honor of Saints, and upon their Reliques; or for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of leagues, treaties, bargaines; for the proofe of denied rights, or of ſuſpected innocence; cure of diſeaſes; happie ſucces, or the like ends: and the keeping or carrying of the conſecrated bread, for devotion or adoration, are moſt ſuperſtitious and idolatrous profanations of the Sacraments, and ſo hainous ſins againſt God;</p>
            <p n="124">CXXIV. Who being the Lord of all things, &amp; having vouchſafed to manifeſt to men, in what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion he will be ſerv'd by them; 'tis (I Beleeve) an intolerable preſumption, to alter or break wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly the leſt of all his Laws: and 'tis alſo a great blindnes, to thinke to pleaſe him in that way, which he doth not approve.</p>
            <p n="125">CXXV. To receive then his Sacraments other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, then he doth appoint, and to ſerve him in I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, ſtatues, ſuperſtitious ceremonies, idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous and will-worſhip, pilgrimages, vowes, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and confeſſions made unto Angels and dead Saints, feaſts and faſts kept for them, and oathes taken by them, cannot have his gracious regard, as things pleaſant to him; but juſtly draw his curſe, as abominable folies. Yea,</p>
            <p n="126">CXXVI. I Beleeve, that Vowes &amp; Praires made unto God alone, and Oathes taken by him, if they be ſuch, as he doth not require, nor in that faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he approves; ſuch as prayers in unknowne tongues, &amp; concluded by the name, merits, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of anie other, then of Chriſt, are abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before him.</p>
            <p n="127">CXXVII. And ſuch I doe Eſteeme all light,
<pb facs="tcp:169468:23"/>
falſe, injuſt vowes, prayers and oathes: &amp; amongſt them, thoſe fooliſh, raſh and impoſſible vowes of povertie, chaſtitie, obedience, which are held by manie perſons, ſuch hie actions of religion, that thoſe have got the ſpeciall name of religious, who make ſuch vowes to God, the Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> and ſome chiefe Frier.</p>
            <p n="128">CXXVIII. And as the making of ſuch vowes, and taking of ſuch oathes doe doubtles greatly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend God: ſo I Beleeve; he is highly diſpleas'd, at the breach of all vowes, promiſes, oathes, which in themſelves are juſt and rightly made, either to him or anie man: for, he hates both the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ill, &amp; the omiſſion of holie duties, and all juſt promiſes: yea anie thing whatſoever againſt his holy Law, whether it be in thoughts or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ds or actions, great or little, is odious to that pure and righteous Spirit, whoſe Law being ſpirituall &amp; generall, the whole man is ſubject to it, and judg'd by it.</p>
            <p n="129">CXXIX. By Gods Law, I conceive the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Will, in the holie Scripture, wherein he hath been pleas'd to manifeſt fully what he loves and abhorres; and ſo to command us the firſt, and forbid the ſecond.</p>
            <p n="130">CXXX. I Beleeve then, that all Injunctions &amp; Prohibitions, which concern men in generall, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout faith &amp; good works, muſt be diligently both beleev'd and obſerv'd. Yet ſince the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath for our eaſe made a compendium of his morall Law in ten precepts, and Chriſt hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd faith or knowledge to two heads, of God and of himſelf; having declar'd my faith, concerning God, Father, Son, holie Ghoſt and manie other things, and intending to ſet it down fully concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chriſt, I will now ſpeak onely of thoſe ten
<pb facs="tcp:169468:24"/>
Commandements, &amp; briefly thus.</p>
            <p n="131">CXXXI. I Beleeve them the juſt and perfect rule of morall honeſtie, finely and fully, although ſuccinctly, expreſſing our duties to God and man, and forbidding what may offend either. I ſay fully for in their brevitie, we muſt wiſely underſtand the whole, by a part; the generall, by the ſpeciall; prohibitions, by injounctions; inward duties, by the outward: and on the contrarie, outward duties, by the inward; injounctions, by prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; the ſpeciall, by the generall; and a part, by the whole.</p>
            <p n="132">CXXXII. All theſe ten Commandements containing each ſpeciall matters, may be yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to two Heads, the Love of God, and Love of the Nighbour.</p>
            <p n="133">CXXXIII. Who then Loves God, with all his heart, ſoule, ſtrength; as a good child loves his Father; regarding him above all things; rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in his perfections; magnifying his name &amp; workes; inviting all men to his love, all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to his praiſe; fearing to diſpleaſe him, and ſeeking to pleaſe and ſerve him, in that way, he preſcribes; adoring him alone; having no faith, no hope, but in his wiſdome, pow'r, goodnes, for what concernes the ſoule; ſeeking health, eaſe, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, riches, but from him &amp; by lawfull meanes; enduring patiently his corrections; being thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for his bleſſings, &amp; in all things ſubmitting his will unto his, doth (I Beleeve) fulfill the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of the firſt Table, which concerne God and his ſervice.</p>
            <p n="134">CXXXIV. And who in and for God loveth his Neighbour as himſelfe, doing what he can lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to inſtruct him, in the right &amp; full knowledge of the Lord, to divert him from ſin, exhort him to
<pb facs="tcp:169468:24"/>

            <p n="135">CXXXV. But becauſe this love towards God &amp; man cannot be ſo pure &amp; perfect, in the ſtate of our corruption, but that we ſin daily 'gainſt both, &amp; ſo tranſgreſſe the law of God; and by our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion looſe the bleſſing of everlaſting life pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd unto its obſervers, &amp; doe daily incurre the curſe threatned unto its tranſgreſſors, I Beleeve &amp; confeſſe, that though the Law be juſt &amp; perfect in it ſelf: yet by reaſon of our weaknes, ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> it is not ſufficient to Salvation.</p>
            <p n="136">CXXXVI. Sith then my workes are imperfect, I Beleeve, my faith muſt ſupplie their want. And ſince the Law cannot ſave me, but rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes me; I borrow the helpe of my faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving God, for my righteouſnes or juſtification. And becauſe it is not enough, to beleeve in God without Chriſt, this is my Heartie Faith in him, &amp; Verball confeſſion of him, beſides thoſe points, I have alreadie toucht concerning him</p>
            <p n="137">CXXXVII. That God, Father, Son, holie Ghoſt having in mercie Elected ſome men, it pleas'd that onelie wiſe &amp; gracious Spirit, to give them Chriſt, as the effectuall meane of their Election, &amp; ſole cauſe of their Salvation. 'Twas then decreed, that the ſecond Perſon of the incomprehenſible Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſhould aſſume mans nature, thus to be made to Gods Elect, wiſdome, righteouſnes, ſanctification &amp; redemption.</p>
            <p n="138">CXXXVIII. And leaſt our Nature ſhould be corrupt, ſinfull in Chriſt, if as man he had deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:169468:25"/>
from <hi>Adam,</hi> by naturall generation; it was likewiſe decreed, that a pure and perfect bodie ſhould be formed by the power of God, of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified ſubſtance of a faithfull Virgin, without the helpe or ſeed of man.</p>
            <p n="139">CXXXIX. And as this was eternally decreed, ſo I Beleeve, it was perform'd in the appointed time: for, the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Marie</hi> beleeving Gods meſſage, &amp; conſenting to be made a Mother, without anie carnall knowledge of man, did by the power of the holie Ghoſt conceive that wondrous Child, who by an eternall Generation is the Son of God, without Mother; and by temporall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, the Son of Man, without Father.</p>

            <p n="141">CXLI. The Union being Perſonall, of two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in one Perſon; I Beleeve, that as the Perſon of Chriſt can not be divided, ſo his Natures are not, can not be confounded, but ſtill retaine their eſſentiall proprieties; the divine being eternall, infinit, omnipotent, omniſcient; and the human, temporall, finit &amp; once paſsible, having a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of time, &amp; limits for knowledge, power &amp; <pb facs="tcp:169468:25"/>
place. For though Chriſts human pow'r, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, wiſdome were great &amp; excellent: yet</p>
            <p n="142">CXLII. I beleeve, they were finit, ſo that all things were not poſſible &amp; known unto him, as man, although as God, he knew, could doe all things, which are not contradictorie. I ſay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that although Chriſts Perſon, (to whom the proprieties of both natures are common) knew all things in the wombe; yet it was not by his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, by which he being born, increaſed in wiſdome, learning new things by dailie experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And thus I Beleeve, he was born.</p>
            <p n="143">CXLIII. Although his bodie was by the power of God form'd in an inſtant to the requiſit growth, for the reception of the ſoule, yet he was in the Virgins wombe, &amp; grew in it to greater ſtrength, till the dayes were accompliſht, that ſhe ſhould be deliv'red.</p>
            <p n="144">CXLIV. And then the bleſſed Maid brought forth in <hi>Beth-lehem,</hi> &amp; in a ſtable, the Maker of heaven &amp; earth, who then appeared to the world, in the ſhape of a poore Servant, in the forme of a weak Infant, whom beholding with the ſtrong eyes of faith, I moſt humbly adore: for,</p>
            <p n="145">CXLV. I Beleeve, that that Infant is God and Man: Man, to doe &amp; endure for me, that is, in my ſteed &amp; for my good, what I could not, yet ought both to doe &amp; ſuffer: and God, to give infinit price, efficacie or force unto the actions &amp; paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Humanitie, &amp; apply them to me.</p>
            <p n="146">CXLVI. I Rely then wholly on the merits of Chriſts obedience to Gods Law, &amp; of his ſuffrings for my ſins; Beleeving, he exactly obſerv'd the Law for me, &amp; fully ſatisfi'd his offended juſtice; and ſo by his paines &amp; righteouſnes both origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall &amp; actuall, redeemed me from ſin, death, hell;
<pb facs="tcp:169468:26"/>
and purchaſt me grace, life, Heaven.</p>
            <p n="147">CXLVII. Chriſt then is all my hope, my onelie Mediator of redemption &amp; interceſſion, through whom I live on earth in grace, &amp; ſhall in heaven in glorie. To procure me both theſe, &amp; alſo to ſhew me examples of humilitie, meeknes, patience &amp; all vertues, my Saviour was borne amongſt beaſts; ſubject to my paſſions &amp; infirmities, yet without ſin or diſorder; circumcis'd the eighth day; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into Egipt; Perſecuted through all his Life, which having led moſt holily, humbly, painefully, patiently &amp; miraculouſly, chiefely the three laſt yeares; in which by his mightie wonders &amp; divine inſtructions he manifeſted his Deitie, he ended it, by an ignominious and cruell death, drinking at laſt the full &amp; bitter cup of Gods indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin and ſinners, treading alone the Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe of Gods wrath, &amp; ſhedding all that precious bloud, which is our bath &amp; onelie purgation.</p>
            <p n="148">CXLVIII. I Beleeve then, that as he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent us, he was in his human nature expos'd unto the wrath of God, which his innocent Soule ſo lively apprehended, that ſhe was heavie unto death, then enduring for his Elect (by the helpe of the Deitie ſupporting the Humanitie) th' eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall paines due to their ſins, &amp; ſo making to God ſatisfaction in that nature, yea in both parts of that nature, which had offended him.</p>
            <p n="149">CXLIX. For, unto this fearefull apprehenſion &amp; ſpirituall ſenſe of Gods indignation, which (I Beleeve) he had often, were added moſt grievous torments, his pure bodie endur'd, from his birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, to the laſt moment of his life: ſo that he was both in ſoule &amp; bodie, &amp; in his life &amp; death, wounded for our iniquities, bruis'd for our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, curs'd for our ſake, and kill'd to give

us life; as thoſe being the end of his Incarnation.</p>
            <p n="150">CL. And thus was the Lambe of God ſlaine, for the ſins of all the faithfull, from the foundation of the world unto its deſtruction. After manie indignities, blows, paines, he was nail'd to a croſſe, and hang'd betwixt two theeves, as the greateſt malefactor: and ſo indeed was he, as he did then repreſent thouſands of ſinners, for whoſe ranſome he truly and willingly dy'd, offring to God his paines &amp; death, his paſſions &amp; actions, for redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption &amp; ſalvation of his Elect, whom he did ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="151">CLI. Chriſt our life being dead, I Beleeve, that his Bodie was buried, to teſtifie the realitie of his death, &amp; how our ſins were then buried with him, which without his humble paſsion had caſt us downe into hell-fire. But as Chriſt dy'd without the leſt offence to God or man; ſo the grave could not hold him long, but the third day of his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall</p>
            <p n="152">CLII. I Beleeve, that Chriſts glorious ſoule was reunited to his Bodie, by the power of his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, which never forſook them, but kept them ſtill, one in heaven, &amp; the other in earth, in that wonderfull and incomprehenſible perſonall union. And this reunion being made of the two parts of his humanitie, Chriſt roſe out of his grave, as well to aſſure me of my ſpirituall &amp; corporall reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from ſin &amp; death; as to receive the reward of his obedience unto the Law of God, &amp; unto death for me: for,</p>
            <p n="153">
               <pb facs="tcp:169468:27"/>CLIII. I Beleeve, that Chriſt having well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd his office, in the ſtate of his humiliation, in planting, teaching, governing &amp; redeeming his Church, for which hee did humble himſelfe, and become obedient to the death of the croſſe; it pleaſed the Father, to exalt him, manifeſting his Deitie, through which the whole Humanitie was made moſt free from naturall infirmities, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with ſuch agilitie, impaſſibilitie, glorie &amp; felicitie; that it ſurmounts the excellence of the verie Angels, having the full meaſure of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both in ſoule and bodie, of which they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable without deſtruction. I confeſſe then, they are as glorious as may be: yet</p>
            <p n="154">CLIV. I Beleeve, that glorie is finit, and much inferior to the eſſentiall and incommunicable perfection of the moſt glorious Trinitie. Albeit therefore Chriſts perſon be as glorious, as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and holie Ghoſts: yet his Humanitie being not capable of that infinit perfection, it can not have that omniſcience, omnipotence, Ubiquitie, Majeſtie and felicitie, which are proper to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie. The knowledge then, power, glorie and joy of Chriſts ſoule is finit, although moſt rare &amp; excellent: and his glorious, immortall and agile bodie is likewiſe &amp; muſt be finit, ſolid, viſible &amp; palpable, having his juſt meaſure in length, bredth, depth, &amp; being contain'd in that place, which he is pleas'd to fill for the preſent.</p>
            <p n="155">CLV. Heaven being the proper ſeat of all bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſoules after death, I Beleeve and confeſſe, that Chriſt Jeſus, to give me aſſurance of my future glorification &amp; aſcenſion thither, firſt in the ſoule, immediatly after my death; then in Soule and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, at the Reſurrection; did fourtie dayes, after his riſing from the dead, aſcend triumphantly and
<pb facs="tcp:169468:27"/>
viſibly into the heaven of heavens, that higheſt Orbe, which the great King of Kings hath made, as a fit place, for the full manifeſtation of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of his glorie, the greatnes of his pow'r, the excellence of his wiſdome, and the exces of his bountie.</p>
            <p n="156">CLVI. And Jeſus being Aſcended thither, by the Almightie pow'r of his Divinitie, I Beleeve, he is there, ſitting at the right hand of God, that is, having in his Humanitie, glorie, wiſdome, pow'r &amp; ſtrength next to Gods; governing heaven, earth and hell, but chiefely ruling and teaching his Church, by his omnipreſent ſpirit and all-filling Divinitie, by which he is with her, till the end of the world; interceding for her and ſhewing his Father the wounds, he ſuffred for her ſake: and ſo by his merits &amp; praires ſanctifying and bleſſing her, &amp; by his pow'r protecting her, from the devill and his members;</p>
            <p n="157">CLVII. For whoſe generall overthrow &amp; finall ſubjection, and to manifeſt Gods mercie and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice towards men: I Beleeve, that the Lord Jeſus (whom the heavens containe till the end of the world, as he is man, although as God he be everie where) ſhall then appeare in Majeſtie and great glorie, &amp; that by his Almightie pow'r, which at firſt made things of nothing, and <hi>Adams</hi> bodie of the duſt; all the dead ſhall then riſe, and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving be chang'd, &amp; all appeare before the glorious throne of Chriſt, there to be judg'd according to their works, yea manie for their Works: for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly</p>
            <p n="158">CLVIII. The reprobat ſhall then perceive, that their infidelitie and wickednes are the cauſes of their everlaſting damnation in hell, where they ſhall feele ſuch deſperat &amp; perpetuall griefes of the

            <p n="159">CLIX. But thoſe bleſſed perſons, who by Gods grace beleev'd in him, lov'd, fear'd, ſerv'd him, ſhall then be Judg'd, according to their Workes, yet not Sav'd for, or by thoſe workes, but by the meere mercie, of God, in and by Chriſt their gracious Judge: who in his juſt anger having ſentenc'd and ſent the wicked into Hell, with the approbation and praiſe of the Elect.</p>
            <p n="160">CLX.

But if 'tis ſuch, as it muſt be; pray O Chriſt, that my faith faile not but confirm it, &amp; make me ſtedfaſt in good works, to the glorie of thy mercie, in the Salvation of thy poore ſervant, &amp; of al thoſe, who by my good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels &amp; vertuous examples, ſhall find the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thee, &amp; the right meanes, to love, ſerve, pleaſe &amp; enjoy thee.
