         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Dear and Tenderly Beloved Friends, and Called of God every where;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN a real and deep sence of my Heavenly Fathers Love and tender Mercy revealed through his most dear Son, our ever blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, which I am (with many more) livingly made a partaker of, doth my Life and Spirit very dearly and tenderly salute you, as truly and most heartily wishing and praying, that divine Grace, Mercy and Peace, with all Spiritual Blessings and Divine Favours in Christ Jesus, may be encreased and multiplyed among you, and unto you, to your great Consolation, Peace and Prosperity in the Love of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dear Friends,</hi> I finding for some time of late a living and holy constraint and pressure of Spirit to communicate some things of weight and concern unto you, respecting your Safety, Peace and Prosperity in the blessed unchangeable Truth, am opened and encouraged by the precious Life and Spirit of our God, to be clear and free therein towards you all, and that in discharge of my tender Conscience in the sight and presence of the God of my Life, whom I serve with my Spirit in the Gospel of his dear Son, as I have sincerely done from my Youth upward, blessed be his pure Name forever. And having had these many Years ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in the weighty Service of the Lord our God through manifold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Exercises, Burthens, Spiritual Travels and Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I may not hide my Talent, nor conceal those things my Lord and Master requires me to divulge for the Safety and Good of his People in their several Conditions, States and Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as having long and truly seen the goodness of the Lord in the Land of the Living, and the good and blessed Estate of his chosen and faithful Ones; for which I praise the Name of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36821:3"/>
Lord my Redeemer, in whom I have believed through his divine Goodness, never to be forgotten by any of us; as also being not ignorant of, or unaquainted with the many Wiles, various Workings and Depths of Satan, the great Adversary of mans Felicity, and of the Peace of God's People, who worketh upon the divers Inclinations, mutable Affections, Wills, Weaknesses and Infirmities of the Sons of Men, to deceive, pervert, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave and corrupt them, that they may the more easily be led captive by him at his Will, in their following their own unsub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Wills and Spirits. You therefore (my <hi>dear Friends</hi>) who have livingly felt, and tasted of the Lord's Power and Goodness, and known his Work in your Hearts, in order to your Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Redemption out of the Evil World, and the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof, prize his tender Mercies and Goodness, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get them not: Let the holy fear of the Lord God be your Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and true Wisdom, and Understanding, the Stability of your times in Righteousness: Let your sincere Love to the pure Name and Truth of the Lord, and one unto another be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in that unchangeable Truth and Power of an Endless Life, whereunto the Lord hath called us; and I pray God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease your Love and Zeal for his Glorious Name and Christian Tenderness, and Brotherly Affection one towards another, that Life for evermore may be your Blessing and Portion, as it will be to all them who dwell in Amity, true Love, and Unity of Spirit in our Lord Jesus Christ, which is a most joyful, comfortable and blessed state, which too many Professors of Truth are short of, for want of keeping near to the Lord, in his holy fear &amp; Love of his blessed Name and Truth, whose negligence and unfaithfulness to Truth in themselves hath caused a decay of Love, &amp; want of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards others; and then instead of humbly waiting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon the Lord, some have exalted themselves in a Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, Self-conceit, &amp; Affection to preheminence in judgment over others, until thereby Divisions and Self-separations have been caused and stirred up by them, to the great grief of the Spirits of the upright, who have kept their Integrity to the Lord, his Truth and People. And this Self-Exaltation, slighting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning others, have been, and are the great Evils, Snares and Engines wherewith the Adversary catches them that never were
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36821:3"/>
throughly subjected into true Humility, Mortification, true Self-denial, or dying with Christ; such, though under Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Truth, may make a great shew and flourish for a time in outward appearance, Leaves and Blossoms, yet they bring not forth Fruit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto perfection, or ripeness in Christ. Therefore beware of Self-exaltation, beware of an Earthly Spirit entring, beware of Covetousness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is Idolatry: Let not the Earth interpose betwixt any of your Souls, and the brightness of that divine Glory which has appeared even in our Day and Times.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spiritual Gifts</hi> may be lost, or fallen short of, if the Fountain of them, the holy Spirit of Life it self, be not diligently minded &amp; followed; and where Love towards God and his Truth decays in any, their love towards his Servants and People grows cold, and then their Gifts decrease and dye, as the Life of them is withdrawn or departed from, or that Love lost which is the more excellent way; for <hi>If I want Charity</hi> (or Love) <hi>I am nothing.</hi> What Gifts, Openings, Discoveries, Visions, Revelations, Wisdom, Knowledge or Understanding soever any have, yet still 'tis the heavenly Root must bear them, they must keep low their Minds and Spirits to that from whence Life and Love springs, or else they fall, wither, dye and become empty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable and hard-hearted; and there the Enemy has his Evil Ends upon them, in betraying them, and corrupting their minds from the Truth, from Life, from Love, from the Innocency and Simplicity which is in Christ, the Way, the Truth and the Life; and there's a danger in being too early and forward to censure and judge others, and in judging, censuring and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing others Gifts, Ministry and Labour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> whom God hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into his Work and Service; for some whereby may either lose their own Gifts, Life and Strength, or fall short of those heavenly Gifts, which otherwise they might attain to, if they kept low and tender in Humility, Love &amp; Society with their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, whereby they might also be serviceable with them: For I have seen in my time some who never passed through Judgment in themselves, yet very censorious, judging, detracting and whisper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against their Brethren, slighting them, their Ministry and Labours, who themselves have greatly lost by it; and God in displeasure hath suffered them to discover their own weakness
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36821:4"/>
and nakedness, for their own abasement under the righteous Judgment of Truth. And 'tis evident from this kind of exalted censorious, whispering and envious Spirit (which worketh not for <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Union</hi>) have proceeded the several <hi>Divisions, Schisms</hi> and <hi>Separations</hi> which have happened, to the great trouble of the Church of Christ in our days, as in the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> days. And the several sorts of <hi>Apostates</hi> &amp; <hi>Backsliders</hi> from Truth shew what, and what kind and manner of Spirit they went and go out in by their Works and Fruits, whether in a Spirit of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Ambition,</hi> in a Spirit of <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> in a <hi>scornful contemning</hi> Spirit, in a <hi>covetous earthly</hi> Spirit, in a <hi>loose prophane</hi> Spirit, or in a <hi>drunken debauched</hi> Spirit of <hi>Ranterism</hi> and <hi>fleshly Liberty,</hi> which come all from one evil Root and Seed, according to the various corrupt Inclinations and Wills of Men, upon which the Enemy works and appears with Baits and Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons suitable thereunto, that he may prevail the more. And 'tis certain, that the envious Apostates, and wilful Adversaries were the most troublesome to the <hi>Primitive</hi> Churches of Christ and his holy Apostles in their day, and so in ours. Therefore blessed and truly happy are they that keep their Habitations in the Truth and love of God, and live in <hi>Christian Love</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another; for such walk in the Light, where there's no occasion of stumbling, or scandal. And as 'twas Evidence unto the <hi>Primitive Christians,</hi> that they were passed from Death to Life, because they loved the Brethren, and that they had purified their Souls through their Obedience of the holy Spirit unto unfeigned Love of the Brethren. Even so now the same Evidence &amp; Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny remains and lives in and for all them that dwell in the Love of God one towards another: For all <hi>Envy, Prejudice, Back-bitings, Whisperings, Tale-carrying, Lying, Heats, Passions, Provocations, Reviling, Railing, Clamours, Scorn, Contempt, ill Language, Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi> and <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> are to be utterly put away, avoided, judged, condemned, and forever excluded the Camp of God, for they proceed from the false and degenerate Birth, evil Seed and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and not from the true Seed or Birth which is Innocent, and hurts no body by Word or Action, in Person, Name, Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Property, for that's tender in all these things: For <hi>false Reports, Whisperings, Back-bitings</hi> and <hi>Tale carrying</hi> cause Strife
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36821:4"/>
and Division, and are condemned by the Law of God and Light of Christ, and expresly forbidden by God himself, <hi>Thou shalt not be as one that carries Tales up and down among my People: Thou shalt not receive a false Tale, nor raise a false Report against the Lord's People, nor do his Prophets or Servants any harm.</hi> And all who profess the Truth, or make mention of the Name of the Lord among us, ought to watch over their own Spirits, Wills and Passions, and have a care of hurting one another, or crush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any tender Spirit or Plant, or stopping or quenching any Spiritual Gift or Testimony God has given, how little or low soever it may be, or seem; for some of a tender Spirit are soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hurt and wounded, than healed. All keep in Christian Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, Meekness, Patience, Gentleness, and Tender hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness one towards another. And <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Overseers</hi> in the Churches of Christ must be Examples of Believers, both in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mllity, Meekness, Patience and Condescention, as <hi>Christian</hi> Patterns; and not self-willed, nor soon angry, nor given to Passion, Striving, Heats or Contention: Such <hi>Christian</hi> Examples and Behaviour in the House and Church of the living God, tends greatly to keep out and prevent Contentions, and contentious Spirits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to the comfort and encouragement of the upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, who are willing to serve the Lord, his Truth and people.</p>
            <p>My <hi>dear Friends,</hi> the Lord our God has been good to us, a tender Father through all our Tryals, Sufferings and Exercises, in upholding us by his free Spirit, accompanying us with his presence, comforting us in our Afflictions, with his renewed Mercies and multiplied Favours, in preserving us a living people to his praise until this day, and affording us this present <hi>Liberty</hi> we have of late enjoyed, and do pertake of the benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in our publick, peaceable and Religious As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, for the Exaltation of the glorious Name, holy Truth, and divine Power of the Lord our God. Wherefore we have great cause to prize his tender Mercies and Goodness to us, and walk humbly under the sence thereof, that a right use and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement may be made of all the Mercies and Priviledges we do enjoy, and such a good use of the present <hi>Liberty,</hi> as that none grow careless or negligent, indifferent or luke-warm
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:36821:5"/>
because thereof, nor any to sit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Yet the great God will <hi>distress Nations,</hi> and cause the Earth to tremble before him, and <hi>Overturnings</hi> and <hi>Desolations</hi> in the Earth before <hi>Calamities</hi> are ended, or Christ's peaceable King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom be set up more generally in the Earth, or where as yet it is opposed and resisted: For the cause why <hi>Wars, Desolations,</hi> and the <hi>devouring Sword</hi> are already in <hi>great Judgment</hi> entred so many Nations and Countries, is because of the Crying Sins, Great Provocations, Persecutions and Cruelties in the dark Places of the Earth.</p>
            <p>And <hi>dear Friends, Brethren</hi> and <hi>Sisters,</hi> whom I truly love in the Lord, who retain your Integrity and Love in the blessed unchangable Truth, you cannot be unsensible how that the Lord's Harvest is great, and what need of faithful Labourers there now is, an effectual Door being open in this time of Liberty, the Lord in Mercy has granted for the good of many poor Souls, that they may come and receive the Truth in the love of it; and that they who have been, or are of a fearful Heart, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive strength, and know the Lord to be their Saviour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, in this his Evangelical Day, and free and blessed op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity he has afforded. And yet though this Harvest be great, the diligent and faithful Labourers are but few now rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up, in Comparison of the greatness of the Harvest, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of the Work, many of our antient Brethren, and faithful
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:36821:5"/>
fellow-Labourers and Helpers in Christ, being taken away, and gone to their Everlasting Rest, having faithfully served out their Day and Generation, fulfilled and finish'd their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony with Joy and Peace, and obtain'd a Crown of Glory that shall never fade away.</p>
            <p>And this very matter has been often seriously upon my Thoughts, and weighty Considerations, What should be the Cause or Reason why so few faithful Labourers, and clear Gospel Ministers have been of late raised up, or now brought forth? (though some be in a good lively Testimony, blessed be the Lord) and it clearly appears to me; <hi>First,</hi> That few are given up in their Spirits for this weighty Service, (as we were in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) who are in some measure gifted and qualified.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Few sincerely seek the Lord, or have waited upon him with fervent Desires, Prayer and Supplication, that they may be gifted, indued and qualified with <hi>Power, Wisdom, Faith, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi> &amp;c. for the Work of the Ministry of Christ Jesus; whereas if any man want Wisdom, he should ask it of God, and he shall not miss of a gracious answer to the desire of his Soul, who sincerely asks, seeks and knocks at Wisdom's Gate. <hi>Whatsoever ye ask in my Name</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>believe that ye shall receive it, and it shall be given you.</hi> You know <hi>Soloman's</hi> Request to the Lord, for an understanding Heart, to discern Judgment, his choice of Wisdom rather than Riches, or long Life, how it pleased God, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Very few have their Minds and Spirits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and inwardly exercised in frequent Prayer, and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Supplication to God, or in heavenly Meditation, or spiritual Contemplation in Gods pure and spiritual Laws, Ways, Judgments and Works, or in holy Scriptures, by the holy Spirit, which opens them, but too many have their Minds, Hearts and Affections taken up with these fading Objects and Things below, minding earthly things, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with the love of Riches, Cares and Cumbers of this Life to compass the Earth, wherein many a good Tallent has been hid, and poor Soul buried in Captivity: Whereas it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires an inward and serious Exercise of Spirit toward God, frequent and servent Prayer and Supplication unto him, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:36821:6"/>
and diligent attention upon him, who is the giver of every good and perfect Gift, to obtain both divine Wisdom, and a weighty living clear Evangelical Ministry. For 'tis the sanctified Hearts and Souls who truly fear God, into whom only Wisdom entreth, and maketh them Friends of God, and Prophets. The Lord will have an inward spiritual, sincere &amp; zealous People. Oh! Inward watchfulness, Prayer and Supplication to Almighty God have been, and are too much neglected by many; I pray God they may seriously examine, and find out the causes in themselves with the Light of Christ Jesus, and bring all to the righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If any of the younger sort, who are in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure indued with spiritual Gifts and Knowledge, do let up a slight and dis-esteem in their Minds of their elder Brethren, who are experienced in the Work and Service of God, and keep not in Society or Union with them in the Spirit of Love, and of a sound Mind, but give way unto a singularity, abounding in their own sence, not keeping low and humble before the Lord, nor little in their own Eyes; such neither grow in Life, nor in divine Openings, nor increase in their Gifts, nor come to attain to a weighty clear Evangelical Ministry and Service, but rather loose, dye and wither, unless they come into true Humility, Self-denyal, Reconciliation, Love and Union with their elder faithful Brethren, who in the love of God would tenderly help them, and not hinder them in the Work and Service of the Lord our God.</p>
            <p>It is both a great Grief and Scandal also to see many of the younger sort, who frequent our Meetings, and even of Friends Children also, degenerating into <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>height of Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Apparel,</hi> so nearly to immitate and border upon the World, as too to many do, contrary to the <hi>Gravity, Modesty, Sobriety, Plainness, Simplicity, Innocency</hi> and <hi>Humility,</hi> which Truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires in Example, as well as in Spirit, and which Truth at first led many into, and as still it doth lead and order them that truly love and obey it: In which I pray God to settle and order his People, and that no plea nor excuse may be made to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Pride, Vanity or Immodesty in Apparel, which only gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies vain airy Minds and Spirits, and the Lust of the carnal
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:36821:6"/>
Eye, and grieves the tender, and gives occasion of Reproach and Stumbling to them that are without, and to such as are so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly &amp; Religiously inclined. Oh! 'tis precious to keep low and humble before the Lord, and to walk as living Examples of Christian Humility; <hi>a lowly Mind is content with low things, and loves plainness.</hi> And this is observable, that if never so much be truly and sincerely preached in publick against <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Vanity</hi> in Apparel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if it be indulged or conived at at home in Children or young Persons, by <hi>Parents, Guardians,</hi> or <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers,</hi> all Preaching, Instruction and Warning proves to them but as Water spilt upon the Ground, and takes no Impression, whilst through such Encouragement &amp; Indulgence at home, they imbrace a Spirit of <hi>Pride &amp; Irreverence</hi> towards God, &amp; disregard to his Truth and People; and though some Formality; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the form of Truth they may have by outward Education, 'tis not by the Work of Regeneration, for 'tis but few in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison that really come in at <hi>That</hi> Door; and therefore I have had often a Godly Fear upon me of the springing up of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Plants amongst us, and a degenerate Generation to the dishonour of Truth, and our holy Profession after our days. And it's they who are inclining and getting into the Spirit of the World, and Liberty out of the Truth, who live not in Humility, nor in the Fear of God, that give secret strength to an apostate turbulent Spirit, which has been the Churches Exercise of late Years, and that are most easily catched with that Apostate Spirit, and feigned Words of the Instruments thereof, whose Work is to sow Discord, and make Divisions, Schisms and Separations (which are Fruits of the Flesh) for if all had been faithful to the Light, and kept in Humility and Love of Truth, and one another, there had been no En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity one towards another, nor <hi>smiteing</hi> of fellow-Servants, but the Fear of God would have preserved them out of those Snares of Death, which that Spirit of Discord leads into. Howbeit, I am well satisfied in the Lord, that he will never suffer a general or final Apostacy or Degeneration; the Brightness of our Day, and Glory of our Sun of Righteousness shall never be extinguished: Although too many through the Adversary's Subtilty and Temptations, together with their
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:36821:7"/>
own carnal and corrupt Inclinations, are apt to degenerate, and their Minds to be exalted and alienated from the Fear of God, from the Cross of Christ, from Humility and Lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Mind, from true and Conscientious Tenderness, from love to the Brethren, from Innocency, Plainness and Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity that's in Christ, both in their Spirits, Language and Habits, who therefore ought to be faithfully admonished, and tenderly instructed, by which means (together with a meek and gentle Behaviour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) many have been gained, and many may yet be recovered out of the Snares of Satan, who have been taken Captive at unawares; <hi>Having Compassion of some, making a Difference,</hi> has often reached the tender part in them; and in relation to others more deeply prejudiced. I remember a cautious saying of an antient and faithful Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deceased, viz. <hi>Where we cannot make them better, we must take heed we do not make them worse.</hi> The Lord keep his People in his holy Fear, watchful and humble before him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in true Love and tender Heartedness, that they may receive Wisdom from him to behave<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> themselves, and to minister suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to all conditions.</p>
            <p>And all dear and tenderly beloved <hi>Friends,</hi> with all who are effectually convinced of God's holy Truth and Name, and do profess the same: In the holy fear of God, in his Light Watch and Pray constantly (without fainting) against your Souls subtil Adversary in all his Attempts to beget into Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exaltation and Prejudice to smite fellow-Servants, and cause Divisions or Offences; for that's the Enemy's Work.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Friends,</hi> have not the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ with respect of Persons: This was antient, and <hi>Christian</hi> Counsel. So let not the Rich and High contemn the Low and Mean; let not uncertain Riches puff any up, or exalt them above their Brethren: Nor any Brother of High degree (in earthly Enjoyments) slight or contemn their Brethren of low degree, some sincere-hearted and serviceable Friends and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren have enjoyed plenty of the World's Goods, and yet through Losses, Sufferings, Disappointments, or other's unjust Dealings by them, are brought low in the World, and they were esteemed when in Prosperity. It would be very Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:36821:7"/>
and Sinful, to slight or dis-esteem them in their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, which is their Tryal: The Poor of this World, who are rich in Faith, whom God hath chosen, are near unto him, their Faith is the more tryed by their Poverty and lowness; and how soon That may be the tryal of many that are Rich they know not; therefore 'tis very unsafe for any to trust in <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Riches,</hi> or to be exalted or lifted up because of them, but rather humbly to depend upon the living God, and trust in him, and love &amp; esteem their Brethren in Truth, how mean and low soever in this World, knowing that with God there's no respect of Persons, not with them who truly bear his Image.</p>
            <p>And pray <hi>Friends,</hi> keep out all Disputes and Controversies which some busie Spirits in the World are incident unto, as about outward <hi>Revolutions, Governments, State-Affairs,</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of this World: Let not their Divisions divide you, nor their Strife and Contentions about the outward Court and forms Religion, earthly Kingdoms and Crowns (that will fade) influence any among you, to contend, or become parties about them, but quietly serve and wait upon God in your Places and Stations, where he hath set you, and submissively leave all to his over-ruling Power, Wisdom and Providence, to do or suffer things to come to pass, as he pleaseth; for none may say to him, <hi>What dost thou?</hi> (Though <hi>Men</hi> men may be warned as God shall require) and he knows what's best for his People, and will cause all things to work together for good to them that love him; his Kingdom come more and more, his blessed Will be done in Heaven and Earth, who is Judge of all, and sees all Hearts, Intents and Designs of men throughout the whole World. And you know that as we cannot make Flesh our Arm, nor therewith sight for one, or another; Stillness and Quietness, Innocency and Good-will towards all men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our <hi>Christian</hi> Principle, is therefore the best and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest state and condition, wherein we all may approve our selves as the Lord's <hi>hidden Ones,</hi> and of them that are <hi>quiet in the Land.</hi> Be still, and know that the Lord is God, and that he will be exalted in his everlasting Kingdom and Dominion over all the Kingdoms of men: Neither let the World's Confusions
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:36821:8"/>
confound you, nor the World's Distractions distract you, or any of you, nor the removing of Mountains in the Earth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move you from the Lord's Mountain, nor the unstable Waters or tossing Waves toss, you, or influence any of you, to discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose or hurry you from your peaceable Habitations, but keep in your strong-Hold, your Rock and Foundation, <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> nor let any thing divert you from minding his Kingdom of Peace above all, which is not of this World, out of which mens Lusts, and the ground and occasion of Wars and Fighting are excluded: <hi>For in</hi> Salem <hi>is his Tabernacle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh! let all quietly wait upon the All-seeing, Righteous Holy God, to see his good End through all, and his righteous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination and Decision of the Controversies amongst men: And keep in Innocency and peaceable Conversation towards all, and Innoffensively under, and towards the Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, giving no real occasion of Offence, but as becomes true <hi>Christians</hi> walk in Love and Good-Will towards all, both high and low; for herein hath been, and will be our Safety and Confidence through all our Tryals, being preserved by the Power and Goodness of the Lord our God, as his peculiar People, who is our Stay, our Rock and Refuge, blessed be his Name forever. O! forget not to praise the Lord for all his tender Mercies and peculiar Favours and Goodness in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation until this day; knowing also, that they who sincerely and stedfastly trust in his Name and Power, shall be as Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> that shall never be removed, and that as his Servant <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> declared, <hi>It is better to trust in the Lord, then to put Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in man: It is better to trust in the Lord than to put Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Princes,</hi> Psal. 118. 8, 9. I pray God keep all his People in a steddy Dependance upon him, and Confidence in him to the end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> my tenderly beloved <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> having thus far cleared my Conscience in the sight of God, in the living sence of his Presence and Counsel in these matters, as relating to several States and Dangers, I recommend all to the Faithful and true Witness in themselves, to make the particular and just Application, and to make every one sensible of the weight and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:36821:8"/>
lively Impressions of these and all other <hi>Christian</hi> Cautions and Warnings, proceeding from thence through any of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Christ, for the Safety and Peace of all the Lord's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple among us, even to the least and lowest of his Flock, and those Convinced among us, who are called by his Grace to the Confession of his holy Name and Truth.</p>
            <p>The God of Peace be with you all, and bless you, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease Righteousness, Peace, Love and Union among his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple every where, that all may be stedfast in the Truth, true and faithful in their Day and Time, to the end of their Days; <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
