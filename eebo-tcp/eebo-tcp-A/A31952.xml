            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The one is, <hi>to get an interest in Christ,</hi> the other, to get an <hi>assurance of their interest in him.</hi> The first of these is <hi>absolutely necessary to Salvation.</hi> The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, is absolutely necessary, though not to our Salvation, yet to <hi>our Consolation.</hi> Without the first, we cannot <hi>dye happily.</hi> Without the second, we cannot <hi>dye comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably.</hi> It must not be denied, but that a man may have true <hi>Grace,</hi> and yet want the <hi>Assurance</hi> of it, he may be a <hi>Child of Light in darknesse,</hi>

               <hi>reflect act,</hi> he may have the <hi>Sanctifying work</hi> of the Spirit, and yet want the <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing work.</hi> (Though no man can have the witnessing work, who hath not the Sanctifying, yet a man may have the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying, and yet want the witnessing work of the Spirit) <hi>Ioseph</hi> may be alive and yet his Father <hi>Iacob</hi> may think him dead, true grace may be in us, and yet we may not only not know it, but beleeve the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>This condition though it be <hi>sad,</hi> yet it is not <hi>damnable.</hi> For as a <hi>wicked man</hi> is never the nearer Heaven, because he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously conceits he is in the way to Heaven, no more is a <hi>Child of God</hi> the nearer Hell, because he thinks he is in the way to Hell. <hi>Christ</hi> was not therefore a <hi>Gardiner,</hi> because <hi>Mary</hi> thought so, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was <hi>Ioseph</hi> therefore dead, because <hi>Iacob</hi> imagined him to be dead. He that beleevs shall be saved, whether he knows it or knows it not; he that walks in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens way shall certainly at last come to Heaven, though he thinks himself out of the way.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding all this, though the <hi>Grace of Assurance</hi> be not simply, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary, yet it is a most <hi>precious jewell,</hi> without which we can neither <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

part with life. It is a <hi>Heaven upon earth, a Heaven before we come to Heaven.</hi> The <hi>Prelibation</hi> and <hi>Pregustation</hi> of <hi>Heaven.</hi> It is the <hi>hidden Manna, Abraham's bosome, the joy of the Lord,</hi> and the <hi>peace of God which passeth all understanding.</hi> It is to be laboured after with all labour. And therefore the Apostle perswads us, <hi>to give diligence to make our calling and election sure.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The subject of this ensuing Treatise, is to direct and teach us how to get an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble assurance of salvation: Here are severall Marks and Characters propounded of a man in Christ, the work is very weighty, and of great concernment, for whosoever undertakes to lay down marks of a Child of God, must be carefull of two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he doth not propound <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of Grace,</hi> which are proper only to <hi>eminent Christians,</hi> as belonging to <hi>all true Christians,</hi> least herein he makes <hi>sad the hearts</hi> of those whom God would not <hi>have made sad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That he doth not mention such <hi>Characters</hi> of a <hi>true Child of God,</hi> which may be found in an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> least he makes <hi>glad the hearts</hi> of those whom God would not have <hi>made glad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Author of this book hath brought very many marks of a true <hi>justifying faith,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49225:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of a <hi>distinguishing Love</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> of <hi>of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance unto life</hi> and of a <hi>new Creature,</hi> &amp;c. Now though thou canst not apply all of them as thy <hi>portion</hi>; yet if thou canst apply many of them, and sincerely labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to be <hi>capable</hi> of <hi>applying</hi> the rest, thou art in a happy condition.</p>
            <p>There are two wayes by which a man may come to know his interest in Christ. The one is by the <hi>witnesse of his own spirit.</hi> The other by the <hi>witnesse of Gods Spirit.</hi> There are some who say, there is but one <hi>witnesse,</hi> the witnesse of <hi>Gods Spirit</hi>; This I grant is the chief witnesse; but I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the Scripture doth also hold forth, the witnesse of a mans own spirit as well as of Gods Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. It is not said, <hi>the Spirit witnesseth to our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> but with our spirits, <hi>that we are the Sons of God.</hi> Wherenote, that a mans own spirit is a <hi>co-witnesse.</hi> This witnesse of a mans own spirit is nothing else, but the <hi>testimony of an illightened andrenewed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science reflecting upon its grace and assuring the soul that it is in Christ,</hi> &amp;c. Of this way of assurance, the Apostle speaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.3. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.21. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.18. <hi>Act.</hi> 24.16. When a mans conscience bears him witnesse upon Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture grounds, that he doth beleeve and repent, and that he is a new Creature,
<pb facs="tcp:49225:4"/>
this is instead of a thousand witnesses, and it is a <hi>continuall feast,</hi> in the worst of times.</p>
            <p>But now because the <hi>voice of conscience</hi> is sometimes so <hi>low a voice,</hi>

And because also the <hi>eye of conscience</hi> is sometimes <hi>blind,</hi> (through ignorance,) and cannot see the garces it hath, and is ready to beare false witnesse against it self, and to say, it is not <hi>justified,</hi> when it is. Or if not <hi>blind,</hi> yet it is many times <hi>dimme,</hi> and cannot see the happy condition it is in. And sometimes it is <hi>infested</hi> with <hi>melancholly,</hi> which makes it look upon its own condition with <hi>black spectacles.</hi> And because the graces of Gods Spirit in his Children are sometimes so small and little, or at least so blotted and blurred, that conscience cannot read the graces God hath given it. Hence it is, that God out of his great goodnesse hath affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us <hi>another witnesse,</hi> besides the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of conscience, which is the <hi>witnesse of his own Spirit, witnessing with our spirits that we are the Sons of God.</hi> This indeed is the great, and the infallible witnesse, therefore it is compared to a <hi>Seal,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

The most people in the world trouble their heads little about it, and their hearts lesse; know not what it is, nor how to go to worke to attain it, some think it is impossible to attain it; others seek not after it, some desire it, but cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, others enjoy it, but do not impart it, hence it comes to passe, that few reap the comfort of it, I think it not amisse therefore, to speake somewhat of it, seeing it is a thing without which, we can neither live, nor di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. The second is this, He that would get as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance must seek it as it is to be sought after;<note place="margin">

               </note> He must seek it according to the Scripture di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory, that is, diligently, orderly, humbly, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severingly.</p>
            <p>First, He must seek it diligently, <hi>Give dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to make your calling and election sure,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>2 Pet. 1.10.</hi>
               </note> saith the Text: He that would get assurance must seek it diligently and industriously, he must seek it, as <hi>Solomon</hi> teaches us to seek wisdoms and understanding; <hi>seek for it, as for silver, and search for it, as for hid treasure;</hi> It is treasure, which lies hid, and lies deep in the Bowels is the Scripture, and he that will obtain it must dive deep for it, and dive with his eyes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, as the <hi>Indians</hi> are said to do for pearl, he must labour for it industriously, as labourers do in silver-mines.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He must seek it orderly, he must follow the vein; He must not begin where God begins, but where God ends; he must not begin at the root to fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

discry the roote, my meaning is, he must not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with Gods decree in predestination, which is the root of salvation; But with regeneration and justification, which are branches issuing out of this root, other wayes he may destroy the tree ere he is aware, I mean himself, and all hope of Heaven and salvation, as I have known some do, and fall into utter desperation; The truth is, he that will not beleeve, untill he read God's decree in Heaven, must never look for any assurance of Heaven here, nor fruition of it hereafter; <hi>If you will not beleeve, you shall not be establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>

               </note> saith the Text; He that will reach to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder, must begin at the lowest step; this is the Scripture way to get assurance; Christs directory prescribes it, when Iesus Christ would instruct <hi>Nicodemus</hi> about his spirituall and eternall estate, he did not send him to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to read the records of the celestiall court, but sent him to read himself over, to search his own heart and life, to consider whether he were <hi>rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate</hi> and <hi>born again,</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>Ye have loved me, and beleeved,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Father him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self loved you, because ye have loved m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>, and beleeved that I came out from God:</hi> It is as if Christ had said, your faith to me, working by love to me, demonstrates it; for Christ doth not here make our Faith, or our love the cause of Gods love to us, but the discoverer of it: And the Apostle tells us, <hi>That whom God did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know he also did predestinate, to be conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Image of his Sonne,</hi> and ver. 30. saith,<note place="margin">

               <hi>that whom he did predestinate, them he also called (to wit)</hi> inwardly and effectually, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his purpose, by giving them saving grace; and <hi>whom he thus calleth, them he also justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and <hi>whom he justifieth, them he also glorifieth;</hi> And here the Apostle followeth the example of his Lord and Master, leading us to the cause by the effects, and to the end by the meanes, hence it is evident, That he that would get assurance of his Election, must seek it in the workings of God, in, and upon himself; he must consider, how his justification i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> evidenced by his sanctification, and his election by both. Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is Gods work in us, justification is Gods work upon us, both together are certain pledges of his good will towards us</p>
            <p>In the third place, He that would seek assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as it is to be sought after, must seek it humbly, with feare and trembling, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls upon us so to do, <hi>Work out your own salvation with feare and trembling,</hi>

his estate, yet it is very difficult.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He must seek perseveringly, he must never give over asking untill he receive, never give over seeking untill he find what he seeketh; He must follow the example of the Spouse seeking her Beloved, inquire of the watchmen, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the Gospel, where, and how to find, what he seeketh; and followeth Christ by ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest prayer, as the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> did, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he obtaine his suit, and he must not rest sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the beginnings thereof but still labour for increase.

Allowance of sinne and assurance cannot stand together, they are as contrary as fire and water, the one will out the other: Therefore he that would get assurance, must deny himself in point of sinne.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49225:15"/>
the Lord is joyned to the Soul, and the Soul to the Lord, so as they are made truly one.</p>
               <p>This Union between Christ and his Members is made by the Spirit of God, whose office it is to joyn Christ and his Members together, it is the Spirit immediately on Christs part, but the Spirit mediately on our part, that makes this Union.</p>
               <p>Christ by an actuall habitation of his Spirit in his Elect, really joyns himself unto them and becoms truly one with them.</p>
               <p>Christ by his Spirit works unfeigned faith, in the hearts of his elect, by which they habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally abide in him, joyn themselves unto him, and become truly one with him: Christ and his Members thus joyned together, are one by Conjunction.</p>
               <p>To get assurance of thy Union with Christ then, thou must of necessity begin here, <hi>viz.</hi> with a diligent search, whether thou art indued with the Spirit of Christ, yea, or nay; and in searching after this take notice,</p>

               <p>I judg it not necessary, nor meet for me to take this description asunder, or speak of the several terms of it, and therefore pass it by. In a word or two only, I will briefly declare, why I call this faith a work of the Spirit, and why a speciall work of the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I call this faith a work of the Spirit of God, because it is not natural; were it natural, it would be common, <hi>but all men have not faith,</hi> as the Scripture saith, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3.2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Few have this faith, as the parable of the <hi>seed</hi> shews, <hi>Mar.</hi> 4.2. to 9. it is a work su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural

and divine.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I call this Faith, a speciall work of the Spirit, to distinguish it from that common work of the Spirit, which is in unregenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
               <p>Having thus briefly described this Faith, I am in the next place to descry it, and distinguish it from all other; this I shall do for brevity sake positively.</p>
               <p>This Faith then, as I humbly conceive, may be discerned and differenced from all other kinds of faith, by these concurrent and essentiall properties of it, which here follow.</p>
               <p>This Faith is bred, fed, and nourished, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, by the word preached,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> 1.</note> as appears by <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14, 17.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this Faith as it is begotten by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> word, so it is grounded upon the Word, upon the written Word of God; Not fancy, but the Word is the ground of it.</p>
               <p>It gives firm, absolute, and unlimited assent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to the whole Word of God, promises, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and commandements, so farre forth as it doth apprehend it to be of God<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> simply be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is of God; the whole Word of God is the generall ground and object of it. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the Law, that it is good, holy, and just, and good, saith a true believer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. ver. 16, 12. <hi>Believing all things that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Law and the Prophets,</hi> Act. 24.14. But the more special object of it is the promises of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>This Faith is seated in the heart, the heart is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the most proper subject of it, <hi>With the heart man believeth unto righteousness,</hi> saith the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. Justifying Faith is not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49225:19"/>
barely notionall, but reall; it is not a bare head-assenting, But a heart-consenting, what the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding saith is true, the will saith is good, and embraceth it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> This Faith is an unfeigned Faith, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. An Hypocrites faith is but feigned faith, but justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, is unfeigned, how weak soever it be, it is true and real, it carrieth the whole heart to God in obedience, as well as the whole out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> This Faith is a Christ-receiving faith, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth and embraceth whole Christ, Christ as a Saviour and Christ as a Lord in all his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Prophet, Priest, and King, and it causeth him that hath it, to give up himself wholly to Christ, to be ruled by him in all things, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Word: Thus the Gospel tenders Christ, and thus a true beleever receiveth Christ: <hi>My Lord and my God,</hi> saith believing <hi>Thomas,</hi> of Christ, and it is the property of justifying Faith, thus to embrace Christ, <hi>They gave themselves unto the Lord,</hi> (saith the Apostle) of some true believers, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5.

               <p>In the eighth place; This Faith relyeth whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> on the Merit of Christ for Salvation, for justification, disclaiming all confidence in the flesh, and excluding all boasting in our selves: As appears by the Language of the Apostle, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3, 9. <hi>And have no confidence in the flesh. Not having mine own righteousness, which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Christ. Where is boasting then? it is excluded. By what Law? of works? Nay; but by the Law of Faith,</hi> Rom. 3.27.</p>
               <p>This Faith opposeth the Mercy of God in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Christ against all sinne, as greater then all. <hi>The Blood of Iesus Christ his Son, cleanseth us from all sinne,</hi> saith a believer, speaking of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, 1 John 1.7. Because God hath said, <hi>He shall Redeem Israel from all his iniquities,</hi> Psal. 130.8. <hi>All manner of sins and Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49225:20"/>
shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, but the Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost,</hi> Mat. 12.31.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> This Faith, as it lays hold on the promises of God, so it makes him that hath it, carefully observe the Conditions of the promises on his part, <hi>Lord, I have hoped in thy word, and done thy Commandements,</hi> saith a true believer, <hi>Ps.</hi> 119.166. thereby intimating; That it is the property of a true faith, thus to rest on Gods promises; A true believer applies Christ unto himself, and himself unto Christ, the promises to himself, and himself unto the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, unto the conditions of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> It is the property of this Faith to adhere to Christ, even when it cannot see him, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend one jot of love from him, when he hideth his face from the soul, and speaks bitter things, and doth bitter things unto the soul, <hi>Behold</hi> (saith Job) <hi>I go forward, but he is not there</hi>;<note place="margin">Job 23.8, 9.</note>

This the Scripture cals for, <hi>Isa.</hi> 50.10. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it follows, that this a true believer in some measure doth: It is the property of a true believer to adhere to Christ as <hi>Asahel</hi> adhered to <hi>Abner,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam 2. 2 Kin. 2.4.</note> and <hi>Elisha</hi> to <hi>Elijah; Asahel</hi> would

               <p>In the Twelfth place, this Faith is a working <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> Faith, it is not idle but operative and working, as the Apostle intimates, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2. ver. 20.14. <hi>Faith without works is dead and cannot save</hi>; living Faith, is working Faith, justifying Faith, though it do not justifie (by working) yet is still working. It purifieth and clenseth, and that not the outward man only, but the heart also, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.9. It <hi>Sanctifieth,</hi> Act. 26.18. (to wit) sincerely,<note place="margin">The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost originally as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, Faith instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally as the meanes sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</note> univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally, soul and body, and <hi>the spirit of our mind,</hi> as the Scripture speaks; It spurreth on to Obedience, Active and Passive, sincere, universal, and constant, as appears at large, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. Where all those worthies there spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, are said to have <hi>done and suffered all those</hi> admirable things there mentioned <hi>by Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Faith makes a man patiently wait on God, for the accomplishment of all that good which he hath promised in his Word, in a conscionable use of all those meanes, which he hath ordained, warranted, sanctified, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth for the serving of his Providence, and accomplishing of his Promises. The former part of this assumption, is evident by the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49225:21"/>
of the Prophet, <hi>Isai.</hi> 28.16. <hi>He that believeth maketh not haste</hi>; And by that which is spoken of believers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.12. The latter is as evident by the practice of the Saints. <hi>David</hi> believing the Word of the Lord concerning his Sonne <hi>Solomon,</hi> and his building of the Temple, was very instant with the Lord to make good his Word, and what he had Promised; very carefull and conscionable in instructing his Son, to walk with God in uprightness of heart, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto all the Commandements of the Lord, and in providing materials for the Work of the Lords House and encouraging his Son to the Work, as appears by the 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. compared with 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. and 29. <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Daniel</hi> believing the Word of the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the return of the Captivity of <hi>Iudah,</hi> was very instant with the Lord, by fasting and prayer to accomplish what he had promised, as appears, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.2, 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hezekiah</hi> believing the Word of the Lord concerning his recovery out of a dangerous sickness, diligently used the meanes that the Prophet directed him unto, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.7.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Paul,</hi> to instance in no more, beleiving that grand promise, <hi>That the seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, should break the Serpents head. And that the God of Peace would Bruise Satan under his feet,</hi> and that <hi>sin should not have dominion over him.</hi> When <hi>buffeted by Satan, Prayed frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.7, 8.</note> and <hi>Prayed fervently,</hi> he <hi>besought the Lord thrice: when the Law of his Members rebelled against the Law of his mind, and led him Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the Law of sin.</hi> He groaned under this
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49225:21"/>
burden, bewailed his condition, sought the Lord by Prayer for help, exercised Faith on Christ; And <hi>beat down his body and kept it under,</hi> as appears, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23, 24. compared with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27.</p>
               <p>The same Apostle believing the Word of the Lord, concerning the preservation of himself, and his companions, in a dangerous voyage at Sea, diligently exhorted them to use all good meanes tending unto their preservation, sounded the depth, cast Anchors, abode in the ship, <hi>&amp;c. Act.</hi> 27.</p>
               <p>All these meanes these Worthies used to serve the divine Providence; and these examples plainly evidence, That it is the property of true faith thus to depend on God, for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of his Word.</p>
               <p>This Faith makes a man open-hearted, and open-handed towards his Brethren in misery and want mercifull according to the Divine Rule; ready out of a fellow-feeling of others misery, bountifully, cheerefully, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, to do good unto all in misery, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ability, but specially to the Godly; not for his own glory, but Gods, for the honour of Christ and the Gospel, as appears by the Language of the Apostle, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.15, 16. Compared with the 1 <hi>chap.</hi> 27. and that which is spoken of believers in the primitive Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.44, 45.4.34.</p>
               <p>This Faith makes a man very industrious,<note place="margin">Good Faith is full of good Workes</note> in labouring to keep a good conscience in all things, and to walk inoffensively towards God, and towards man in all things, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the Apostle <hi>Paul. Paul</hi> having made a confession of faith, and hope towards God,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49225:22"/>
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 24.14, 15. in the 16. <hi>ver.</hi> of the same <hi>chap.</hi> he declares, how his faith did operate. <hi>And herein do I exercise my self, to have alwayes a conscience void of offence towards God and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Man.</hi> And this Language of his doth plainly evidence, That it is the property of a true faith thus to operate.</p>
               <p>All these are real testimonies, that true justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith, is no Idle Faith, but operative and working.</p>
               <p>It worketh by love. This the Scripture a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Neither Circumcision, nor Vncircumcision availeth any thing, but faith which worketh by love</hi>: thence it is evident, that true faith worketh by love. And this is indeed the great distinguishing Character of it, it worketh by love to God, and the things of God, and by love to man for Gods sake. A true believer works all his works in love to God and Christ; His whole labour in point of obedience, is a labour of love<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> he sees an unfathomed depth of Divine love, declared toward him by God in Christ, and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains him to love God in Christ again; and out of love unto him that dyed for him, to give up himself unto him<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and lay out himself for him. <hi>The love of Christ constraineth me,</hi> saith a true believer, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15. <hi>He is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and blamelesse before him in love,</hi> Ephes 1.4. <hi>My soule hath kept thy Commandements, and I love them exceedingly,</hi> saith a true believer, <hi>Ps.</hi> 119.167.</p>
               <p>This Faith is alwayes accompanied with true repentance; He that truely believes unfaignedly repents; This is evident by the language of the Prophet, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:49225:22"/>This Faith is alwayes accompanied with new <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> obedience.</p>

I may add to this, and say, It is a flesh-over-coming, and a Devill-overcoming faith: for howsoever a true beleever be many times put to the worse for a time, and foiled by one or other of these enemies, yet in the end he overcometh them all, and is <hi>more then a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror through Christ that strengtheneth him,</hi> and overcometh for him.</p>
               <p>This Faith is a heart humbling Faith; it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> the property of this Faith to make an humble heart, as the Language of Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.44. intimates How <hi>can ye believe</hi> (saith he) <hi>which seek honour one of a another?</hi> A true beleever eyes God in all gifts, and in all bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, Spirituall and Temporall, and ascribes all unto free grace; He, and he only labours for and learnes of Christ, heart-humility, and groans under the sense of the want of it, and hence it is evident that true Justifying Faith is heart-humbling Faith.</p>
               <p>This Faith is a God-glorifying Faith, it makes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> a man preferre God above himself, and his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

                  <hi>Love one another,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>as I have loved you,</hi> meaning for the kind of Love,<note place="margin">Ioh. 13.34, 35.</note> 
                  <hi>By this shall all men know that you are my Disciples, if you have love one towards another.</hi> These Texts plainly demonstrate this Love, we speak of, to be a true Character of a true Disciple of Jesus Christ: And must not that needs be a special work of the Spirit of God in man, and a true testimony of his saving habitation in us, which is a real testimony of our Union with Christ, and Renovation by him, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on him? Surely yes. But sincere Love to man, for Gods sake, is eminently all this; therefore this Love must needs be a special work of the Spirit of God, and a sure testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his saving habitation in whomsoever it is.</p>
               <p>Sincere Love is a grace, without which all profession of Religion is but guilded Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie; where Love is, God dwels, but where it is not, the Devil dwels; the more Love, the more like to God; the less of it, the more like the Devil. Wofull experience shews, That those men which have great parts and gifts, and little or no Love, shew more of the Devils nature, then of Gods, and act more like the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49225:26"/>
Devil, then God, where they have power.</p>
               <p>Love is the sweetest flower in all the garden of God, but it is a flower which the Devil can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not indure the smell of, because he is not capable of it, and knows that where Love dwels, he must vanish; and therefore it is his main design to destroy Love, if possible, in all sorts and sects, and to root it up and banish it from the hearts of all men; The Devil is well content, that men should pray, preach, read, hear Sermons, and make a faire shew outwardly, provided this spring not from Love, nor tendeth not to the increase of Love, to God nor man; but if he see Love be the root and fruit of mens services, then he goes cunningly, and Serpent-like to work, to make breaches in this wall, that he may get in and destroy this flower, he deviseth wayes to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide mens judgments, to the end he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy this affection of Love out of their hearts; if he prevaile not this way then he will raise up jealousies to destroy Love and Charity, yea sometimes render the best of graces, the worst of vices; and as in tempting a Carnal man, he sometimes stiles lust, Love, so in tempting a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual man, he somtimes stiles sincere Love, lust; and by these wiles makes a breach on Charity, to the end he may get into the garden of God, and root up this sweet grace of Love.</p>
               <p>Seeing then that this grace of sincere Love to God and man, is a speciall work of the holy Spirit of God, and a grace that he worketh in all those in whom he dwels savingly, to get a true testimony of the holy Spirits saving habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in thee, thou must diligently examine thy self, touching thy Love to God, and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>The properties and effects of sincere Love to God are these<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Sincere Love to God is seated in the heart, in the midst of the heart, and it carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the whole heart and soul to God in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as well as the whole outward man.</p>
               <p>That sincere love to God is seated in the heart, in the midst of the heart, and carries the whole heart to God, will appear thus; That which God in his Word requires, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, that true grace doth in its measure, and in a Gospel way give unto him: But God in his Word requires that we should Love him with the heart, with the whole heart, and soul; and,<note place="margin">Mat. 22.37.</note> Therefore this Command doth sufficiently intimate this truth, to wit, That sincere Love to God is seated in the heart, and carries the whole heart to God, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here note, 1<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> By the whole heart is meant, every faculty of the soul, the whole inner man, the heart wholly, sincerely, so as it is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49225:27"/>
between God and the world, between God and sinne, between God and Satan, as the hearts of all Hypocrites are, but is down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and wholy for God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. My whole heart may then be said to be carried to God, when I cleave to him in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, more then to any thing besides; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him my chiefest happiness, from a due consideration of his perfection; rejoyce in him above all things; feare his displeasure more then all persons or things; depend upon him for all things, and aime at his glory principally in all things.</p>
               <p>Secondly sincere Love to God, is fastened upon God principally,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> 2.</note> for that Divine excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and spirituall beauty which is in him,<note place="margin">He that loves God aright, loves him for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</note> and which he doth communicate unto his People, <hi>Because of the savour of thy good Oyntments, thy name is as Oyntment poured forth, therefore the Virgins love thee,</hi> saith the Text, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.3. Spirituals and not temporals, as this Text shews, are the principall attractives of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and virgin-Love to Christ.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sincere Love to God, is not guided by sense, but by faith, as the language of the Apostle <note n="f" place="margin">1 Pet. 1.3.</note> intimates; therefore saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, <hi>Whom having not seen, we Love,</hi> whom having not seen with Corporall eye nor in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>visible favours, you still cleave to in affection. This is further evidenced in holy <hi>Iob,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to love God, and obey him, even when he could not see one glimpse of his countenance, neither within him, nor without him, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by <hi>Iob</hi> 23.8, 9, 10, 11. verses. And this plainly shews, That his Love was guided by faith, and not by sense, as it is the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49225:27"/>
of sincere Love to be.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Sincere Love to God, is a very strong Love, <hi>Love is strong as death,</hi> Cant. 8.6. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Love to God will make a man to resolve, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="5">5. Sincere Love to God, is an indearing affection, it indears Christ unto a man above all things in the world besides, so as he will willingly part with all things else, rather then Christ; Christ in his Merit, Christ in his Spirit, Christ in his Ordinances, and in his Ministers and People, is deare unto a sincere lover of Christ above all things here below; This is lively set forth unto us in the Parable of the merchant man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.44, 45, 46. <hi>He left all for the Pearl,</hi> the Pearl was dear unto him, and he was in Love with it; hence it was that he slighted all in comparison of it. That Love is an indearing affection, is further evident by the language of the Spouse in Love with Christ, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.10. <hi>He is the chiefest of ten thousand,</hi> saith she, meaning of all; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise by the practise of the Saints, which have sincerely loved Christ, they have willingly part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their fine cloathing for his sake, and worn sheep-skins and goats-skins, they have parted with fine dwellings, and lyen in dens, and caves, they have parted with all, even to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49225:28"/>
their precious lives, Nay these also they have willingly laid down for his sake, in the cruellest way, that bloody persecutors could invent, refusing base deliverance, to advance the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Christ, when he called them forth to suffer, as appears <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. their Love to Christ did indeare Christ to them above all things.</p>
               <p>Here Note, 1. That sincere Love to Christ is strong in all, but not in all according unto the same equal degrees; it indears Christ unto all that have it, above all things, But makes not all to declare it with the like forwardness and courage, nor to declare it at all times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, as many instances in Scripture shew; According to the measure of our faith, so is our Love; if a man beleeve only as a <hi>bruised reed,</hi> as a weakling in Christ, his Love will only <hi>smoak as flax</hi> towards Christ, but if he be strong in faith, his Love will flame, it will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it self with much zeale and fervour of spirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That, that Love to Christ, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs any one thing whatsoever before Christ, or subjoyns any one thing in the world coequal with Christ, is no sound sincere Love, neither is it worth any thing in Christ<hi>'s</hi> account, as his own language shews', <hi>He that Loveth Father, or Mother more then me, is not worthy of me: and he that loveth Sonne or Daughter more then me, is not worthy of me,</hi> Matth. 10.37.</p>

               <p>That Love to Christ which makes not a man to account all things but loss, and dross, and dung for Christ, and to set such a price on Chrift, and his hopes by him, that he resolves through the help of Christ, to part with any thing which may hinder him from doing Christ faithful service, how neare or dear soever it be, or ought to be, yea with life it self, or whatsoever contentments may indeare it unto him, when Christ cals him to it, is no sound nor available Love, as Christ shews when he saith, <hi>If any man come to me, and hate not his Father, and Mother, and Wife, and Children, and Brethren, and Sisters, yea, and his life al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, he cannot be my Disciple,</hi> Luke 14.26.</p>
               <p>Hence it is evident, in the next place, That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> sincere Love to God, is a very tender Love, yea, a Love more tender towards God then towards any thing else, besides God, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons or things, and will make a man willing rather to part with all, persons or things; How neare or deare soever, then with God; yea, so tender a Love it is,<note place="margin">It makes a man tender of offending God.</note> as it will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a man to go in any way, though never so pleasing to flesh and blood, that he knows dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaseth the Lord, nor transgress the least of Gods Commandements with knowledg, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grief of heart, as appears in the example of <hi>Ioseph</hi> and <hi>David.

the carnall Love of his miftress, and the carnal pleasure proffered him by her, for fear of displeasing God. <hi>David</hi> sincerely Loved his God; and hence it was that <hi>his heart smote him,</hi>

                  <hi>for cutting off the lap of Sauls gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; a small matter one would think, yet (saith David) <hi>He is the Lords annointed.

               <p>Hence it appeareth, in the next place, That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> sincere Love to God, produceth and preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a tender Conscience, a holy feare of God in the heart and soul, and a holy hatred of all sin, <hi>How shall I do this wickedness and sin against my God,</hi> saith the soul that sincerely Loves God, when tempted to sinne by the world, the flesh, or the Devil: God hates all iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and he that fincerely Loves God, hates what he hates,<note place="margin">Ps. 97.10.</note> therefore (saith the Psalmist) <hi>you that Love the Lord, hate evill,</hi> to wit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God hates it.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> By considering, 1, What sincere love to man is: And, 2, What the Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of it are.</p>
               <p>Sincere Love to man,<note place="margin">Sincere love to man, what.</note> demonstrating the holy Spirits saving habitation in the soul, is a free affection of the soul, delated on man for God, and according to the rules of God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the holy Scriptures.</p>

               <p>A mans love to his brother, then issues out of the love of God, and the Commandement of God is the efficient cause of it, when he loves him, because God commands him so to do, and out of love to God commanding.</p>
               <p>A man then makes the glory of God the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall cause of his love towards his brother, when he therefore delates his love upon him, that he may acquire and gain honour to God and his Gospel, which he hath called him to the profession of thereby, and makes this his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most scope, and ultimate end in loving him.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:49225:35"/>That love which is squared by, and congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the rule of God, is an universall love, a love which extendeth it self to all <note n="a" place="margin">Col. 1.4.</note>

The words imply a speciall love, or love after a speciall manner, it is as if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle had said, He that loves God in sincerity, loves the children of God after a speciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; <hi>Love the Brotherhood,</hi> saith the Apostle, <note n="i" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.17.</note> meaning after a speciall manner, and this he doth, that loves God sincerely, his love in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to them, is a love of large extent; it extendeth even unto loss of life, in some cases; As in case the honour of God may be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thereby, or a publick good procured unto the brethren<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> the Church of God thereby; This I think is the Apostles meaning, in the 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.16. If sincere love to God and man, be in the heart of a man, it will constrain him, in such cases as these, to deny himself unto the death, to advance the honour of God, and the Churches good; it will make him preferre the Churches good before his own, witness <note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 16.3, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla,</hi> whose love to God and the Church, constrained them to yeeld their own lives, to preserve <hi>Paul</hi>'s: The like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Then again, That love to man which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous to the rule of God, is a love paralleling the love of Christ towards us, for the kind of it; Christ commands us, <hi>To love one another, as he hath loved us,</hi> 
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Joh. 13 34</note> And he whose love is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous to this rule, doth this for kind, though not for measure.<note place="margin">Mat. 10.8.</note>

               <p>That love which is congruous to the rule of God and the love of Christ, is a free-love. <note n="m" place="margin">Luk. 6.35.</note> He that loves his brother according to Christs rule, and Christs example, loves him freely.</p>

               <p>This Text plainly points out unto us two things<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 1. That wheresoever the holy Spirit of God dwelleth savingly, in what soul soever he resideth, as a sanctifier, there he worketh true faith and Repentance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That in whomsoever these graces are wrought, they are a true and real testimony of the holy Spirits saving habitation in that soul, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the Spirit of God alone, to work these in the heart of man.</p>
               <p>Here Note, three or foure things, 1. That the grace of Repentance, though it be a distinct grace from faith, yet is it an inseparable conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant of justifying faith, coupled with it in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, and he that totally wanteth either, hath neither.</p>
               <p>Secondly Note; That faith, and love, and Repentance, and every other renewing grace habitually considered, are coequal, the habit of every grace being infused together: So that where there is one grace in truth, there is every grace in truth, in the habit of it, in some measure.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, That although every grace of the Spirit, habitually considered, be coequal, yet these actually considered, and according to their manner of working, and appearing in us precede each other; faith precedes love, and faith and love precedes Repentance, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance being a fruit of faith and love.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That grace (to wit) renewing grace, and glory, are inseparably linked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: He that hath the one shall certainly have the other, for this grace is the earnest of our inheritance.</p>

That repentance unto salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is an Evangelical grace, a Gospel-grace; The Law knows no Repentance, cals for none, nor works none; it is the Gospel and the Gospel onely, that knows Repentance, cals for it, and works it: <hi>Moses</hi> cals not for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, but Christ doth, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.15.</p>

                  </note> is a godly sorrow of soul for all sinne,<note place="margin">It is for inward fins, as well as outward.</note> arising from the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of a gracious God displeased by sinne, and thou maist discern it by this which here follows.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Evangelical sorrow springs out of the Love of God, and hatred of sinne, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth the Love of God, and hatred of sinne
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49225:42"/>
in the soul; the Love of Christ constraineth the soul to hate sinne, and to mourn and grieve for sinne; and the bitterness of this sorrow and grief for sinne, sweeteneth the Love of God in Christ unto the soul, and inbittereth sinne: And hence it comes to pass, that the soul loves Christ more, and hates sinne more after it hath once felt this sorrow and been sok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, then ever it did before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Evangelicall sorrow is mixed with faith; The Evangelical mourner, bewailes his sinne, and rests on the mercy of God in Christ, and <hi>the promises which are in him, yea, and in him, Amen,</hi> for the pardon of his sinne, and the mortification of his corruptions, and grace to amend.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note.</hi>
                  </note>Faith of adherence, is an inseparable conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant of Evangelical sorrow, although faith of evidence be not so. He that sorrows for his sinne and rests not on Christ for the pardon of his sinne, his sorrow is legal, and not Evangelical, desperation and not contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Evangelical sorrow is mixed with hope; The Evangelical mourner, mourns not without hope, he hath hope of obtaining mercy, even in the deepest of his sorrow for sinne, as appears by his carriage in his mourning; He despaires not, but seeks to God for mercy; his sorrow drives him to God, and not from God; as is evident by the example of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 1.</note> in his deepest distresse, he despaires not, but goes to his father for mercy; but had he not had hope of obtaining mercy, he would have despaired, had he not had hope of obtaining mercy, he would never have gone to his father to seek it.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:49225:42"/>4. Evangelical sorrow is mixed with Joy, being mixed with Faith and Hope; the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical mourner looks upon his sorrow as a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, with which God is well-pleased, and therefore Joys that he can sorrow, that he can offer this Sacrifice to God, <hi>The Sacrifices of God are a broken and a contrite heart,</hi> and <hi>spirit: A broken, and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise,</hi> saith the Scripture, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.17. And this the contrite heart beleeves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Joys, when it can sorrow.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Hence it comes to passe, that the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical mourner, is an agent, as well as a patient, in the action of mourning. He strives to provoke and quicken his dull heart, and soul, to mourn, and thinks no labour too much to bestow, to bring his soul to a godly manner of mourning; He desires nothing more then to turn his Carnal mirth into Godly mourning, <hi>Be afslicted, and mourn, and weep,</hi> saith the Scripture, <hi>Let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into heavinesse,</hi> Jam. 4.9. This, this soul labours wonderfully to do, and nothing grieves him more, than that he cannot more grieve for sinne: He labours to make his carnall mirth the matter of his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual mourning, and wishes, <hi>O that mine eyes were a fountain of tears, that I could weep day and night, for the sinne of my nature, and the sinne of my life, and the iniquity of my People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Evangelical sorrow, is a heart-mollifying sorrow, it softeneth the heart, and makes it very tender and pliab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

touch. Hearts broken with Evangelical sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row are very pliable to the will of the Lord above all other, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> saith a contrite soule, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.6. as if he had said, declare thy will, Lord, and I am ready to obey it, to the utmost of my power, whatever it be.</p>

                     <hi>Note.</hi>
                  </note>Such as the measure of this sorrow is, such usually is the softness of the heart, and the pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability of the will; the more of this sorrow the soul hath, the more tender is the heart made thereby, and the more pliable is the will; the less of this sorrow the soul hath, the less sof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening hath the heart, and the less yielding is there in the will, to the Will of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Evangelical sorrow is a heart meekening sorrow; it meekeneth the heart, and maketh it humbly stoop to the yoke of Christ, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently bear the Chastising hand of Christ, during the good pleasure of Christ. <hi>I will beare the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against him, untill he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me,</hi> saith the contrite soul, <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.9. It moderateth anger and maketh all calm within and without.<note place="margin">It makes the soul to justifie God in all his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as appears by, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.33.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Evangelical sorrow is a heart-humbling sorrow, it maketh the heart humble and lowly; The more of this sorrow there is in the heart, the more humble it is, and the less of this there is in the heart, the prouder it is, the more fearless and careless it is of sinne; <hi>I am no more worthy to be called a Sonne, make me as a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49225:43"/>
then on a Throne, saith the contrite soul.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And hence it is, that the soul evangelically contrite, admires free grace, in every favour that it receives, spiritual or temporal, and is the thankfullest soul of all others, for mercies received; <hi>What shall I render unto the Lord, for all his mercies towards me,</hi> saith a contrite soul? This soul speaks to it self in the language of the Lord to <hi>Ierusalem, I was polluted in my blood,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>and cast out to the loathing of my person, and no eye pitied me, to do any office of love unto me: And then the Lord had compassion on me, and washed me with water, yea, with blood,</hi> with the blood of his Sonne <hi>he throughly washed away my filth, and annoynted me with oyl, indued me with his Spirit, and his grace,</hi> &amp;c. I had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited all right to Heaven and earth into the Lords hand, and he hath given me all back again freely, and put me in a better condition, than I was in before. O the deepnesse of the riches of the Justice and Mercy of God!</p>
               <p n="10">10. In the tenth place, Evangelical sorrow, is a sorrow that keeps the soul in a sweet hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly frame, for all holy and heavenly duties; it sweetly fits the soul for all holy perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.</p>
               <p>Sorrow that flowes from the apprehension of Love in God, is fresh and lively,<note place="margin">

The soul Evangelically contrite, sorrows not so much for suffering, as for sinning; not so much for being displeased, as for displeasing, and dishonouring God by sinne, it is grieved for its sinne, because the holy Spirit of God is grieved by its sinne, and broken with its whorish heart,<note place="margin">Eze. 6.9.</note> as the Prophet speaks, and is melted by the consideration of the incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble goodness of God, and his kindnesse, and love in Christ towards its self, abused by its self, rather then broken with horrour, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, punishments, or slavish feare; <hi>Against thee,</hi>

And this is the second essential part of true Repentance. And this the Scripture cals conversion. <hi>Repent and be converted,</hi> saith the Apostle in the forecited place, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.19. it is, as if he had said, mourn for sinne, and turn from sinne, if ever you would have your sinnes to be done away.</p>

               <p>ANother work of the holy Spirit of God on man, demonstrating his saving habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in man, and a mans eternal salvation by Christ, is Obedience (to wit) sincere, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial, Evangelical Obedience, to the revealed Will of God.</p>
               <p>This Obedience, and this onely, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires and accepts of his Elect, in and through Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>That this Obedience is a work of the Spirit of God in man, appears both by Argument and by Scripture; 1. By Argument thus; Naturally the heart of man is obstinate, stubborne and disobedient to the Will of the Lord; deceitfull above all things, and Hypocritical in all its wayes, doting on Legal, and never minding Evangelical Obedience; and nothing can make such a change in the heart and soul of a man, as of stubborne and disobedient, of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical and deceitfull, to become sincere and Cordial in Obedience, and of a doter on Legal, to become an Evangelical obeyer of the Will of the Lord: But the Almighty Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, whose proper office it is, to renew the Image of God in fallen man; Therefore this Obedience must needs be the work of the Spirit of God, in whomsoever it is.</p>
               <p>By Scripture this is evident likewise, <hi>I will
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49225:47"/>
put my Spirit within you</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>and cause you to walk in my statutes, and keep my Iudgments, and do them,</hi> Ezek. 36.27. Hence it is evident, That it is the Spirit of God, which works the heart of man to Obedience.</p>
               <p>That this Obedience is a work of the Spirit of God in man, demonstrating his saving habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and sanctifying operation in man, is evident by the language of the Apostles, <hi>We are his witnesses of these things, and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given</hi> (to wit) <hi>savingly, to them that obey him,</hi> (to wit) Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially and Evangelically, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.32. And by that of <hi>Peter, We are Elect according to the fore-knowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit unto Obedience,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.2.</p>
               <p>That this Obedience is such a work of the Spirit of God in man, as demonstrates his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall salvation by Christ, is farther evident by these Scriptures following: <hi>Christ being made perfect became the Author of eternall salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unto all them that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5.9. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey my voyce</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people,</hi> Jer. 7.23. <hi>If ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my Covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me, above all people, and ye shall be unto me a kingdome of Priests, and an holy Nation,</hi> Exod. 19.5, 6. <hi>Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdome of Heaven, but he that doth the Will of my Father, which is in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 7.21. <hi>He that doth the Will of God abideth for ever,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.17.</p>
               <p>By these Texts it is evident, That th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>s Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49225:48"/>
is such a work of the Spirit of God in man, as lively demonstrates his eternal happiness.</p>
               <p>Quest. <hi>But what is this Obedience you speake of? How may it be defined?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> It is a special work of the Spirit of God in man, whereby he is inabled to apply Christ unto himself, according unto all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and himself unto Christ, according unto all his Precepts.</p>
               <p>Under these two general heads, the whole work of Obedience is comprehended, as is evident from the words of the new Covenant; <hi>I saith the Lord will be your God, and ye shall be my People,</hi> Jer. 31.33. What doth the Lord require herein on our part? but to take him for our God, and yield up our selves unto him, as his People, to apply Christ unto our selves, and our selves unto Christ, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said. This is the Obedience of faith, this is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Obedience, the Obedience which the Gospel cals for, and which it only accepts. What shall we do, that we might work the Works of God? said some to Christ, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.28. Christ replyes, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. <hi>This is the work of God, that ye believe on him, whom he hath sent.</hi> In these few words, is comprehended the whole work of Obedience, the whole work assigned us by God, <hi>This is the Work of God,</hi> &amp;c. It is, as if Christ had said, you naturally seek Heaven by works, but altogether mistake that work of works, which is only acceptable, and effectual to attain its end, <hi>Beleeve on him whom he hath sent</hi>; Beleeve on him, who hath fulfilled the Law for us, and will fulfill the Law in us; This is the work of God assigned to us,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49225:48"/>
and a work which God worketh in us, and this is unto flesh and blood, of all works the hardest. Here note these Corollaries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corol.</hi> 1. That the Obedience of Faith is of all works the most difficult unto flesh and blood; this requires a man to deny himself totally, which flesh and blood will rather deny God himself, then do. <hi>We rejoyce in Christ Iesus and have no confidence in the flesh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our Souls naturally had rather dye, and put off their immortality and everlasting being, then put on the Lord Jesus Christ. <hi>They will not come to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. We all naturally dote upon works, and say, as the young man in the Gospel, that came to Christ, <hi>What shall I do that I may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit eternall life?</hi> But the work of works, <hi>Beleeve in the Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> we are of all other the farthest from, till the Spirit of God work in us. These from our Saviours mouth, I have deducted, <hi>This is the Work of God, that ye beleeve in him whom he hath sent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Man naturally is so proud, <hi>That he will not seek after God,</hi> saith the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> that is, (God in Christ) for no otherwise can God be approached unto; <hi>He thinks himself rich, and to need nothing, and knows not that he is poor, and blind, and miserable, wretched and naked,</hi> and therefore scornes to seek to God in Christ for wealth. He will rather make a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of Figg-Leaves than of Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, rather cover himself with rotten raggs, than be beholding to Christ for his robe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Man regenerated, so far forth as carnal, is very unwilling to be beholding to Christ
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49225:49"/>
wholly, for all the good he stands in need of; hence it is, that many regenerate persons will rest on promises no further, than they can find themselves to obey precepts, weary themselves out with labouring to fulfil the Law, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver study the Obedience of Faith, which is to renounce all that we can do, <hi>To put no confidence</hi> in the flesh, but rest only on what Christ hath done, and suffered for us, beleeving that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry promise shall be made good to us, so farre forth as may be good for us (for Christ's sake.) This is to apply Christ unto our selves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And our selves unto Christ</hi>] According un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all his precepts: This is the latter clause in the description of Evangelicall Obedience: A Christian by the Obedience of faith, <hi>Opens the everlasting doors to the King of Glory, to come in, and take possession and rule all</hi> in his heart and in his life: He resigns up all to be order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, <hi>who so loved him, that he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for</hi> him, <hi>so that not he, but Christ liveth,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> 
                  <hi>ruleth, and ordereth all</hi>: Every thought is yielded up unto the Obedience of Christ, with desire that he will bring it <hi>into subjection,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.5.</p>
               <p>Faith doth both receive and give; it is faith that applies Christ to the man, and the man to Christ, as appears by <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.12. compared with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. Faith makes him ours, who makes all happiness ours; Faith makes him ours, in whom we are compleat, and generates Love in our souls to him that hath loved us, and <hi>given himself for us,</hi> and this <hi>love constrains us to live, not unto our selves, but unto him which dyed for us, and rose again,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.14,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49225:49"/>
15. and this is that Obedience, which the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel cals for, and which only it accepts; and this, if fincere and cordial, is very acceptable with God, though many wayes deficient.</p>
               <p>It is the Gospel, and the Gospel only, that cals for this Obedience; the Law doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire us to apply our selves unto Christ, no more than it doth require us to apply Christ unto our selves, but barely saith, <hi>Do this, and live,</hi> Transgrefse this and dye,</p>
               <p>The Gospel doth not barely call for this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of Faith, but promises to give it, and works the heart unto it, yea freely gives it us as a gift, <hi>They shall looke on him, whom they have pierced,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. <hi>I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my Statutes, saith the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. <hi>To you it is given in the behalf of Christ; not only to beleeve on him, but also to suffer for his sake,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. These things premised, I proceed to the tryal of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and for the more perspicuity, propound this Question.</p>
               <p>Quest. <hi>How may I discern, whether my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience be sincere and cordiall Obedience, yea, or nay?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Thou mayest discern it, by the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cause, by the final cause and by the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of cordial Obedience: The efficient cause of cordial Obedience, is the Love of God;<note place="margin">Love the Lord thy God, and walk e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in his wayes, are joyned together, <hi>Deu.</hi> 19.9.</note> the final cause thereof, is the Glory of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The efficient cause of cordial Obedience, is the Love of God; cordial Obedience springs out of Love to God, and he that cordially o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys the Will of God, obeys it in Love to God, not slavish feare, nor self love, nor

                  </note> be the action never so good, or glorious in it self, is no wayes acceptable unto God, except it spring from Love; a pregnant proof of this we have, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. where the Apostle shews at large, That all O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience without Love, comes to just nothing; all parts and gifts, all Faith and Obedience, though it be to the death, and the cruellest death, that possibly may be, without faith working by Love, without Obedience spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Love, comes to just nothing at length, <hi>It profiteth me nothing,</hi> saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, though we can do but little for God, if that little we do, issue out of Love to God, it is very pleasing to, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table with God, who looks more on our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, than our action; <hi>Thou hast ravished my heart, my Sister, my Spouse, thou hast ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished my heart with one of thine eyes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>How faire is thy Love, my Sister, my Spouse? how much better is thy Love, then Wine?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.9, 10. I conclude this therefore, with the saying of a worthy man, A Christians affection is his perfection in this fraile condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The final cause of cordial Obedience, is the Glory of God: He that cordially obeys the Will of God, propoundeth the pleasing of God, and the glory of his Name, for his direct,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49225:50"/>
chief, and ultimate end, in all that he doth, in way of Obedience, according to the direction of the Holy Ghost by the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. And these two, the efficient, and the end, denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the action.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The properties of cordial Obedience, are these; Cordial Obedience is free and willing Obedience, voluntary, and not forced. <hi>To whom ye yield your selves servants to obey, his servants ye are,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.16. It is willingnesse in Obedience, that is the beauty of Obedience, and that which God chiefly looks to in Obedience, <hi>If you be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and Obedient,</hi> or willingly obedient, then so and so, <hi>ye shall eat the good of the Land,</hi> Isai. 1.19. <hi>If there be first a willing mind, it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, according to that which a man hath, not according to that he hath not,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.12. <hi>If I do this thing willingly, I have a reward,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.17. By all these places it is evident, That cordial Obedience, is willing Obedience: This was that which rendered <hi>Abraham's</hi> Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence so lovely in the eye of God, he rose early to go about the offering up of <hi>Isaac,</hi> which shews, he did it willingly.</p>
               <p>He whose Obedience springs from Love to God, hath his heart first warmed with the sense of Gods Love to him; and he that aims principally at the glory of God, in his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, hath his heart humbled, when he hath done the best that he can, for that he cannot bring more glory to God, and hence it comes to pass, that he is willing, and ready to obey; He consents to obey, and that without grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or repining, even when he comes short of doing, what he desires to do. <hi>What I would,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49225:51"/>
that do I not,</hi> saith a cordial server of Christ.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Cordial Obedience, is universal Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and that both in respect of the Subject, and in respect of the Object, it is yielded of the whole man to the whole Will of God; the soul, according to all the powers and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof, is only, and wholly for Christ, in its scope and bent, the understanding, the will and the affections, are in their scope and bent, only and wholly for Christ, therefore saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, of such as were cordial servers of Christ, <hi>Ye have obeyed from the heart,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. The body and all its members, are yielded up whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and only to Christ, to the service of Christ, for the magnifying of Christ, <hi>shall I take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an Harlot,</hi> saith the cordial server of Christ? <hi>God forbid,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.15.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 30.2.</note>God requires the whole man, soul and body, to be wholly yielded up unto him, unto his use and service, in Obedience, <hi>Ye are bought with a price, therefore glorifie God in your body, and in your spirit, which are Gods,</hi> saith the Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20.</p>
               <p>God requires soul and body (to wit) the whole man to be (wholly) yielded up unto him, unto his use and service in Obedience, in obeying (all his revealed will) touching, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, doing, and suffering, <hi>Take diligent heed, to do the Commandement and the Law, which Moses the Servant of the Lord commanded you, to Love the Lord your God, and walk in all his wayes, and to keep his Commandements, and to cleave unto him, and serve him with all your heart, and with all your soul,</hi> Josh. 22.5.

He yeelds up his whole man, to the Obedience of the whole Will of the Lord,<note place="margin">Thus did <hi>Zacharias</hi> and <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> obey God, Luk. 1.6.</note> without picking and chusing in the wayes of God, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, or exception, or desire of dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. However he failes in his Obedience, and comes short of what he ought to do, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to do, yet he determines not to reserve any part of himself from Christ, nor to stand out against any part of his holy Will, but hath his heart and mind ready prest, to obey every of his Commandements, which he knows, as well as any, the least as well as the greatest, and the greatest, as well as the least; He thinks not tithing of Mint and Comin too small a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to make conscience of, nor a right hand, nor a right eye, nor an only <hi>Isaac,</hi> nor Life it self, or whatsoever may indeare it unto him, too much to sacrifice, when Christ shall call for it at his hands; He resolves to obey those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, which cross his corrupt nature most, and the sinne of his constitution, as well as those which it can better brook; He resolves to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49225:52"/>

                  <note place="margin">Psal. 119.6.</note>3. Cordial Obedience is conscionable Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: He that cordially obeys the Will of God, obeys not out of by respects, but for conscience sake: Conscience of duty leades him to the performance of duty, so that he, as of sincerity, as of God, in the sight of God, obeys the will of God, as the Apostles phrase is, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17.</p>
               <p>He that obeys the Will of God, out of love to God, and conscience of duty, esteems all Gods precepts, concerning all things, to be right, and hates every false way, one as well as another, even vain thoughts; he consents to the whole will of God; that it is good, and delights in the whole Will of God, after the inward man, and with the mind serves the Law of God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when the flesh is captivated by the Law of sinne: His heart inclineth to perform the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the Lord alwayes, even unto the end, and he wisheth, that his wayes were so direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he might keep all the Statutes of his God.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N these words, the Apostle lays down two great Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of our Union with Christ, or Christ resident in us; The first this, <hi>The body is dead, because of sinne</hi>; The second this, <hi>The Spirit is Life, because of righteousness; Christ is in you</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>except ye be Reprobates,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.5. <hi>If Christ be in you,</hi> it will appear thus, <hi>The body is dead, because of sinne.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Body,</hi> here spoken of, is not a body of flesh, not a body Celestiall, nor a body Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restiall, but a body Diabolicall, a body of sin, as the members, mentioned <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate; and likewise the language of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. where he calls corrupt nature <hi>the body</hi>; and more plainly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. stiles it, <hi>The body of sinne,</hi> Ephes. 4.22. <hi>The old man</hi>; This is the body here meant.</p>

               <p>Death to sinne is double; There is a death to the guilt of sinne; And a death to the power, reign, and dominion of sinne.</p>
               <p>Death to the guilt of sinne, is a perfect fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from all sinne, by the death of Christ for our sinne; thus all in whom Christ lives, are dead to sinne totally.</p>

               <p>By the mercy of God, death, which was to man the wages and punishment of sinne, is made unto all true believers, the end of sinne; the worker of death (to wit, sinne) doth perish, by its own workes sinne is slain, and abolished by death.</p>
               <p>Totall death, to the power, and being of finne, is one great part of the privative gain, which death brings to all that are in Christ, to all that die in the Lord: death the devorcer of soul and body, brings perfect death to the power and being of sinne, the enemy and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of soul and body.</p>

               <p>Death to the power and reign of finne, is one part of the renovation of our natures, consisting in that which the Scripture calls <hi>mortification,</hi> by vertue of which, the love of sinne, and delight in sinne, which is indeed, the life of sinne, is destroyed; At this death the Apostle points, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6 2. <hi>How shall we that are dead to sinne, live any longer therein?</hi> As if he had said, How shall we that are dead to the guilt of sinne, take pleasure in the filth of sinne, or wallow in any sinne with delight?

In the fifth place, The soul that is truly dead to sinne, is universally dead to sinne; he is dead to every sinne, and he is dead to sin in every faculty of his soul, though but in part, yet in every part of soul and body; This, and no less then this, will serve to demonstrate a man truly dead to sinne, in a Gospel-sence.</p>

               <p n="1">1. He is alive, because of the righteousness of Justification, And, 2. Because of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Sanctification.</p>
               <p>That man is truly and perfectly alive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the righteousness of Justification, which hath Christs righteousness imputed unto him for righteousness.</p>
               <p>A man thus alive to righteousness, lives either the life of hope, the life of faith, or the life of sence; and this life Satan doth labour much to deprive him of.</p>
               <p>Where the soul is thus alive, because of the righteousness of Justification, that soul is alive indeed, because of the righteousness of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification; and this is that life which this Text points at, <hi>If Christ be in you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the Spirit is Life, because of righteousness</hi>; If Christ be in
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49225:62"/>
you as a justifier, He is in you as a sanctifier; <hi>If Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sinne, but the Spirit is Life, because of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truth of this assertion, doth further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare thus; <hi>Whom he justisieth, them he also glorifieth,</hi> saith the Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>But without holinesse no man shall see the Lord,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it follows by necessary consequence, That he that is justified hath this qualification in him, to wit, sanctification, otherwise he could not see the Lord or be glorified.</p>
               <p>To whom <hi>Christ is made righteousness,</hi> he is made <hi>sanctification</hi> also, 1 Cor. 1.30. This may suffice for the confirmation of this Truth.</p>
               <p>That man is alive, because of the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of sanctification, which hath the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of the quickning spirit imparted unto him, for the inlivening and regulating of his whole man.</p>
               <p>A Christian, in this world, is alive, because of the righteousnesse of sanctification truly, but imperfectly, his spirit is alive, because of righteousnesse, that is, his understanding, will, and affections, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all the members of his body, his whole nature, so farre forth as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, is alive, because of the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sanctification (I say) so farre forth alive, (that is) so farre forth, he approves of righteousnesse, imbraceth righteousnesse, and lives in the practise of righteousnesse, out of Love to the God of righteoufnesse.</p>
               <p>This is evident in the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> as soon as Christ had taken up his dwelling in <hi>Paul,</hi> and he was once alive to righteousnesse, his whole man so farre forth as regenerate, was
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49225:62"/>
turned about to another point, he had another judgment of the things of God than he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and accordingly imbraced, what he before refused; his heart was warmed with a love to the will and wayes of God, and desire to walk therein; <hi>Lord, What wilt thou have me to do?</hi> (saith he) <hi>command what thou wilt, I am ready prest to obey thy will.</hi> And his great care was, <hi>to have alwayes a conscience void of offence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and towards man,</hi> as himself affirms, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.16. And thus it is with every man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live to righteousnesse, he hath the same frame of spirit that <hi>Paul</hi> had, the same grace that he had, as a man alive to righteousnesse, though not in the same measure.</p>
               <p>Every man in whom Christ lives, is alive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of righteousnesse,<note place="margin">

               <p>As Christ is more or lesse in a man, so is he more or less alive to righteousnesse.</p>
               <p>A man truly alive to righteousnesse, hath these appearances; 1. He is of all other men the most sensible of his own unrighteousnesse, he sees more unrighteousnesse, then righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in his best actions, more <hi>flesh</hi> then <hi>spirit</hi> in himself, as appears in <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7.</p>

Regeneration may well be called <hi>a forming of Christ in us,</hi> for it formes Christ in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, in the will, in the affections, in the conscience, in all the faculties of the soul, in all the parts and members of the body, in the whole man, in the whole life and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</p>
               <p>Here note two or three things; First, That God forms Christ in the whole man, where he forms him truly; God forms Christ in the whole man, by conforming the whole man to Christ.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When every faculty of the soul, is in its scope and bent for Christ, then is Christ formed in the soul, when every facultie of the soul and member of the body is bent for Christ, then is Christ formed in the whole man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When a mans will, desire, aim and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, is to square his whole life by the Word of God, as his rule, then is Christ form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Conversation, then is he a <hi>new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> in Gods account, who measures man more by his will and affection, then his action, as

               <p>There is a vast difference, between being made another man,<note place="margin">The new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the heart, consisteth not in the substance of it, but in the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it; when the heart is made new, the substance is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, but the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty isalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed heart, is in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture called a new heart.

               <p>A <hi>new heart</hi> is proper and peculiar to a <hi>new Creature,</hi> fit, and but fit, to give the appearance of a <hi>new Creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Creature therefore is to be accounted <hi>new,</hi> only as it can derive newnes from within, newnes from the heart and spirit; all without may be <hi>new,</hi> all the apparel <hi>new,</hi> and yet the person <hi>old</hi> that weares it; so all without may be <hi>new</hi> in appearance, profession, words and actions, all <hi>new,</hi> and yet the Creature <hi>old</hi> still; the newness of the Creature consists chiefly in the renovation of the inward man; I say (chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) not only.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> A <hi>new heart,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A new heart, is in Scripture called by divers names, and set forth by divers proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, some of which I will here speak of, as God shall ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me.</note> considered according to its formality, is a heart wherein Christ is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a heart indued with renewing grace, and acted by it, a heart made one with the Lord, a heart wherein Christ is resident and president; And it may be discerned by divers appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances.</p>
               <p>Take this discription of a <hi>new heart,</hi> in which expression you like best, it comes all to one, it is not my work, nor purpose to speak of the terms of this description, therefore I passe from it, to the appearances of a <hi>new heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. A <hi>new heart</hi> is a heart washed from wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse, this is intimated by the Language of the Lord to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> Jer. 4<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 14. <hi>O Ierusalem wash thy heart from wickednesse, that thou maist be saved,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Quest. But you will say, <hi>How shall I know, whether my heart be washed from wickedness, or not?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I will mention only one Character of a heart washed from wickednesse, which is this; In a heart washed from wickedness, vain thoughts do not lodg as welcome guests, and if not vain thoughts, then much lesse wicked thoughts: this is plainly hinted in this Text, <hi>wash thy heart from wickedness, that thou maist be saved; how long shall vain thoughts lodg within thee,</hi> it is as if the Lord had said? Thy willing lodging of vain thoughts within thee, plainly demonstrates thy heart is not washed from wickednesse, for were thy heart washed from wickednesse, vain thoughts would not,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49225:70"/>
nay they could not lodg within thee, as welcom guests.</p>
               <p>Vain thoughts may, and oftentimes do, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise in the best and most holy man or woman alive,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note.</hi>
                  </note> but they do not lodg with such a person as welcome guests.</p>
               <p>Object. But may some say, <hi>I cannot from this conclude, that my heart is washed from wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, but rather that it is not washed from wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, for I find that vain thoughts do not only arise in me, but lodg with me, abide with me long, and many times with delight, I do not only think vain thoughts, but many times bid them wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This know, that every one whose heart is washed from wickednesse, beares the Image of a double person; he beares the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of a person washed, and of a person unwashed, of the old man, and of the new; and so farre forth as he is washed and clensed, he doth decline and hate vain thoughts, but so farre forth as unwashed and unregenerate, they are welcome and pleasing to him; The heart that is washed from wickednesse is not perfectly but imperctfely washed: hence it comes to pass, that there is in it both a detesting of, and a delighting in (the same thing,) at the same time; vain thoughts lodg not with the regenerate part of the man, as welcome guests, whatever they may do with the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate part.</p>
               <p>Vain thoughts, as Satans souldiers, may quarter upon a man,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note.</hi>
                  </note> whose heart is washed from wickednesse, will he, nill he, but they are not welcome guests, but wearysome guests to him, so farre forth as washed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:49225:70"/>Whosoever therefore can find, that he doth truly hate and decline vain thoughts, ought not hence to conclude, that his heart is not washed from wickednesse, nor that he hath not a <hi>new heart,</hi> but rather to conclude with the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.17. <hi>It is no more I that do it, but sinne that dwelleth in me</hi>; it is no more I, as washed and sanctified, that welcome these guests, but it is sin that dwelleth in me that doth it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, Another appearance of a <hi>new heart</hi> is, purity: a <hi>new heart</hi> is a pure and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple heart: That which is in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> called, <hi>a new heart,</hi> is by Christ called, a <hi>pure heart,</hi> Mat. 5.8. and a <hi>blessed heart</hi>; which plainly declares, that a <hi>new heart</hi> is a <hi>pure heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>pure heart</hi> is of all other the most sensible of its impurity, it still finds more impurity, then purity in its self, and therefore goes to Christ for more cleansing stills, to the Blood of Christ, to the Spirit of Christ, to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Christ, with the desire and language of <hi>David, Create in me a cleane heart, O Lord,</hi> and puts that promise in suit, Ezek. 36.25.</p>
               <p>A <hi>pure heart</hi> will not mix with any impure thing, but is still purging it out, it is like a pure fountain, still purging it self, it makes a man very industrious tokeep a pure conscience. <hi>To keep himself pure from the pollutionsthat are in the world through lust,</hi> pure in thought, in word<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and in deed: a <hi>pure heart</hi> desires to have all pure within and without.</p>
               <p>A <hi>pure heart</hi> loves the pure word of God, for the purity of it, not for the novelty of it; <hi>Thy Word is very pure, therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A <hi>pure heart</hi> makes the pure Word of God its rule to walk by in all things, and labours to order its conversation by this, both towards God and towards Man in all things.</p>
               <p>The purity of the heart in the state of grace, consists in the simplicity and sincerity of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note.</hi>
                  </note> not in the perfection of it; its purity is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical.</p>
               <p>The purity of sincere holinesse, is fit, and but fit to give the appearance of a <hi>new heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. A <hi>new heart</hi> is an <hi>upright heart</hi>: Upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is another expression, whereby a <hi>new heart</hi> is deciphred in Scripture; in divers places, when the <hi>heart</hi> is made <hi>new,</hi> it is made <hi>upright</hi>; uprightnesse therefore is fit, and but fit to give the appearance of a <hi>new heart</hi>; upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heart being that which makes the great difference between a true Child of God and an Hypocrite.</p>

               <p>An <hi>upright heart,</hi> is an humble heart, the <hi>heart</hi> that is lifted up is not <hi>upright</hi>; so much pride, so much Hypocrisie there is in the heart; so much integrity and uprightnesse, so much humility is there in the heart: Christ formed in the heart, and the heart, must needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble him in humility, for he was <hi>meek and lowly in heart</hi>; an upright heart is a levelled heart.</p>

               <p>An <hi>upright heart</hi> is a heart perpendicularly, directly and chiefly for God, in all its aimes and ends; it exalts God in all things, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things, because he only is to be exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Uprightnesse exceedingly desires, and indeavours to improve every price in its hand to the glory of God the giver, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.18.</p>

               <p>An <hi>upright heart</hi> is a soyl, wherein the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall seed of the word takes kindly rooting, springs up, and brings forth fruit, in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, more or lesse, as Christ affirms in that Parable, <hi>Mark</hi> 4.8.</p>
               <p>Integrity or uprightnesse is a growing and spreading plant, it is a plant which how small soever it be at its beginning, if once planted, grows greater and greater, it is alwayes grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at last, then at the first; This <hi>Bildad</hi> hinted to <hi>Iob,</hi> Job 8.7. and this Christ plainly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms in the Parable of the <hi>mustard seed,</hi> Mat 13.31, 32.

crooked times, it will hold fast its integrity whatever it part with else, as God and an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right man affirms, <hi>Iob</hi> 2.3. and 27.5, 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Iob 23.11, 12.</note>As an Hypocrite will not abide in the truth, no more will the truth abide in him: Truth may be in an Hypocrite for a time, but it will not abide in him; God doth sooner or later take it quite from him; but truth in an upright heart, it abideth there, so saith the Apostle, <hi>The annointing which ye have received of God abideth in you,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.27. Truth in an upright heart is in its proper element, and therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth there.</p>
               <p>These appearances of an upright heart, which I have collected from the bare Word, I thought not amisse here to insert, and for brevity sake, I will multiply no more, but proceed to the fourth appearance of a <hi>new heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. A <hi>new heart</hi> is a self loathing heart, as appears by <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 31. <hi>A new heart will I give you, saith the Lord,</hi> and what follows? <hi>Then shall ye remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber your own evill wayes, and your doings that were not good, and shall loath your selves in your own sight,</hi> &amp;c. Thence it is evident, that <hi>a new heart</hi> is a self-loathing heart, it loaths it self for all its iniquities, and for all its abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for all its guilt of sinne, and for all the filth of sinne that it sees in its self, for its inward corruptions as well as its outward transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A <hi>new heart</hi> is an obedient heart, a heart made pliable to the Will of God, as appears by the fore-cited place, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. <hi>A new heart will I give you, saith the Lord,</hi> v. 26. <hi>And
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:49225:74"/>
cause you to walk in my Statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them,</hi> ver. 27. Hence it is evident, That a <hi>new heart</hi> is a heart pliable to all the revealed Will of God, a heart on which the Word of God, and the Works ofGod make impression, and it is therefore called a <hi>heart of flesh,</hi> Ibid v. 26.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A <hi>new heart</hi> is a heart new principled; it hath in it principles above nature, above mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality (to wit) Divine principles, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of grace, by which the whole new man is acted.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Another appearance of a <hi>new heart,</hi> is this, A <hi>new heart</hi> is alwayes accompanied with a new spirit, <hi>A new heart will I give you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hence it is that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls for reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in Spirit in profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Eph. 4.23.</note> 
                  <hi>and a new spirit will I put within you, saith the Lord,</hi> Ezek. 36.26. A new heart and a new spirit are here coupled in infusion by the Lord, which shews, they are twins born together, they alwayes go together, live everlastingly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; this <hi>David</hi> pointed at, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.10. <hi>Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>David</hi> knew that where God gave a <hi>new heart,</hi> he gave a new frame of spirit also, and therefore he puts both into his bill, when he put this promise in suit; When God makes the <hi>heart new,</hi> he makes the spirit new also, he frames it of another fashion, points it towards another course, raiseth it from Earth to Heaven, meekeneth it, and makes it more easie to be intreated.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The principles then being <hi>new</hi> and the <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit new,</hi> where the <hi>heart</hi> is made <hi>new,</hi> it must needs follow in the next place, by necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry consequence, That the <hi>life</hi> and conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is <hi>new</hi> also, for these being made <hi>new,</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:49225:75"/>
cannot but produce <hi>newnesse of life</hi>; therefore I conclude this thus, A <hi>new heart</hi> alwayes produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a <hi>new life</hi>; if the <hi>heart</hi> be <hi>new,</hi> the <hi>life</hi> will be <hi>new</hi> also; Christ if truely formed in the Creature, is formed in every part of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in the whole man, in the whole life and conversation of the man, from his converti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and new birth; This is the last, but not the least demonstrator of a <hi>new heart,</hi> of a <hi>new Creature,</hi> and such, as without which, no man can ever safely conclude, that his <hi>heart</hi> is <hi>new</hi> or his <hi>Creation new; He hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the World, that we should be holy and blamelesse before him in love,</hi> Eph. 1.4. This therefore is vigor fit, and but fit to give the appearance of a <hi>new heart,</hi> of a <hi>new Creature.</hi> Thus much of the second appearance of a <hi>new Creature,</hi> he is one that hath a <hi>new heart.</hi>

In the third place, A <hi>new Creature</hi> is one that lives in Christ, the new ftock, as a branch in the vine; And brings forth fruit in him.</p>
               <p>That a <hi>new Creature</hi> is one that lives in Christ the new stock, is evident by the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Apostle in this Text, <hi>If any man be in Christ, he is a new Creature</hi>; hence it is evident, that he is in Christ, or else he is not a <hi>new Creature,</hi> first in Christ and then <hi>a new Creature</hi>; as D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <p>That he bringeth forth fruit, is evident by the Language of Christ in the 5, &amp; 6. <hi>verses</hi> of that <hi>Chapter, He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

work of the Spirit of Christ in him.</p>
               <p>Quest. <hi>But how may I discern, whether my fruitfulnesse in righteousness issue from a common assistance of the Spirit of Christ, to wit, naturall and moral principles only, or whether I be fruitfull in righteousnesse as a branch in Christ the true vine?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. Fruitfulnesse in righteousnesse issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from natural and moral principles only,<note place="margin">Col. 1.10.</note> is not universal but partial, but he that is fruitful in righteousnesse as a branch in the vine, is fruitful in every good work, at least in his aime and indeavour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Fruitfulnesse in righteousnesse, issuing from moral principles, is usually more exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary in circumstantials, then in substantials, more in mint and annise, then in judgment and mercy; but he that is fruitfull in righteousnesse, as a branch in the vine, sunders not what God hath coupled together, but places substantials in the vant-gard, in the first place.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Fruitfulnesse in righteousnesse, issuing from morall principles is usually more in the eyes of men, than in the eye of God: Such as are fruitfull in righteousnesse from their own principles, are more studious to make all things seem good and glorious in the eyes of men, than they are to approve the righteousnesse of their hearts or wayes to God; but he that is fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in righteousnesse as a branch in the vine, is more studious and carefull to approve the uprightnesse of his heart and actions to God in all things, than to make things seem good in the sight of men; He is more desirous to be fruitfull then to seem fruitfull.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:49225:76"/>4. Fruitfulnesse in righteousnesse, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from naturall and morall principles, is usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally attended with much pride inwardly in heart, if not outwardly in expression; and the more fruitfull this man is,<note place="margin">This he finds by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> the more proud he is: contrarywise fruitful in righteousnesse as a branch in the vine, is attended with much hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; a man that is fruitful in righteousnesse, as a branch in the vine, sees that he hath no sap, but what he hath from the stock, into which he is ingrafted; no sufficiency in himself to any good; he sees that his good motions, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and actions, flow all from Christ, and therefore he humbly ascribes all to Christ; The glory of all his fruitfulnesse, he layes on Christs shoulders, he shall beare the glory, saith this soul, he dares take none to himself, though tempted thereunto by Satan, but sayes of Christ, as <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> did of <hi>Ziba, Let him take all, who is all in all, Who am I? and what am I, that I should offer,</hi> after this manner. Thus his being filled with the fruits of righteousnesse, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to the Glory of Christ, who is his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse: The more fruitfull a branch in the vine is, the lower he is.</p>
               <p>That fruitfulnesse in righteousnesse, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from natural and morall principles on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is attended with these forementioned ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, is evident in the Scribes and Pharisees, who were men very fruitfull in righteousnesse from their own principles, yet did pick and chuse in the wayes of God; <hi>Tythe mint and annise, and omit the weightier matters of the Law, and of the Gospel too; strain at a Gnat, and swallow a Camel,</hi> as Christ tells them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. were very industrious to make all they

               <p n="4">4. He whom the Spirit of God thus leads, he fits and inables to walk with God, under Ordinances, as appears by <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. where

The Text doth not say, That the Spirit perfectly cureth our infirmities, [<hi>but he helpeth our infirmities,</hi>] He helpeth them, by doing that for us, which we cannot do our selves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. this each mans experience, which is thus led by the Spirit will tell him.</p>

He that is thus led by the Spirit, finds so much sweetnesse in his leader, that he still desires to be more led by him, to be filled with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as the Scripture speaks; He never thinks he hath enough of the Spirit, but still desires more, and his soul follows hard after the Lord in Prayer, and in the use of all meanes by him appointed, for the attaining a greater measure of the Spirit than he yet hath.</p>
               <p n="9">9.

               <p>Then again note this, Man at his best estate here follows his leader, walks after the Spirit, but as a blind, lame impotent Creature, if at one time he runs after his leader, and follows him vigorously, at another time he is weary and walks slowly; now he stumbles, and anon fals, and were it not that his leader, is very able, wise, and watchfull, he would give over quite and fall irrecoverably.</p>

he resisteth him; and all this he doth in the strength of the Spirit of God, whom he hath chosen for his leader; all this is evident in <hi>Paul,</hi> a man led by the Spirit of God, after a special manner; his courage and resolution was such, that he maintained a constant warre with these three enemies, on this ground, that they would have been his leader, they had led him before, &amp; would have led him again, but this he had rather dye then yield to, when once led by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as his own testimony, in divers places proves.</p>

Christ had a Spirit delighted in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of all Gods Ordinances, and all holy duties, as his frequent exercise therein, and exhortation thereunto, do fully evince; he was still ready to take every opportunity to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct the people, as appears by <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Mar.</hi> 2.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.34. <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.1, 3. and he exhorted his Disciples to duty, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. <hi>ult.</hi> By which it is evident, that his Spirit was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted therewith.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Christ was of a world contemning Spirit, as his Birth, Life, and Death, did ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare and evince, for in all these he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his contempt of the World, both in the good and evill of it.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Christ was not of a time-serving, but of a God-glorifying Spirit; <hi>He sought not his own, but his Fathers glory, in all times and things,</hi> as his own Language, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.28. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17.4. shews, <hi>Christ sought his Fathers glory in all things, and above all things</hi>; which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently declares, he had a God-glorifying Spirit.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Christ was of a faithfull Spirit; he
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49225:91"/>
was faithfull to God in all things; <hi>He was faithfull to him that appointed him,</hi> saith the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Heb. 3.2. <hi>He was a faithfull High-Priest,</hi> He is called, <hi>Faithfull and true,</hi> Rev. 19.11. <hi>The faithfull and true witnesse,</hi> Rev. 3.14. By all which is evident, that Christ was of a faithfull Spirit.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Christ had an elivated Spirit, <hi>his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was raised above the World, and the things of the World</hi>; his Spirit did sore aloft and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace it self, in the things of the other world; it did solace it self in God,<note place="margin">Prov. 8.30.</note> in what he did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy in God, before he left the bosome of his Father, and what he should injoy with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>when he had finished the work, which his Father gave him to do.</hi> This is evident by the Language of Christ, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.5. and by that which is spoken of him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Christ was of a stable Spirit; he did not stagger in Spirit, or reel up and down from one opinion to another, but his Spirit was stedfast with God, and unmoveable, in calmes and in storms; <hi>He was yesterday, and to day, and the same for ever:</hi> How variable so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the world was in their opinion of him, yet he was still the same, as appears, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8. Which evidently demonstrates, his Spirit was stedfast with God.</p>
               <p n="20">20.

               <p>The particulars fore-mentioned, shew what Spirit the Lord Jesus Christ was of, and this Text tels us, what spirit he that is one with Christ is of, what spirit a <hi>new Creature</hi> is of; <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord, is one spirit,</hi> he is one spirit with the Lord.</p>

               <p>Wouldest thou then know thy self, and thy condition truely, I know no rule in Scripture more infallible, than this in this Text, <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord is one spirit</hi>; Consider what hath been said on this Text; Consider what Spirit Christ was of, and then examine thy self whether thou art one Spirit with him; Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whether the spirit that is in thee, do truly answer to the Life, to the Spirit of Christ; if so, know that it argues thy state good, thy Creation new, Christ and thee truely one.</p>

               <p>The Position of the Apostle, is confirmed by a plurality of witnesses, both <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> concurre with <hi>Paul</hi> herein; <hi>Whom the Lord loveth he correcteth, even as a father the son in whom he delighteth,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 3.12. <hi>As many as I love, I rebuke and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.19. The truth of this position hath been experimented by a cloud of witnesses, by all the Sonnes and Daughters of God, that have gone before us unto Glory, and will be by all that shall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after us, and therefore needs not much proving.

               <p>The most people in the world, fetch their evidence of Gods Love, from Gods liberall dispensations of his gifts, either natural or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural, eternal or internal, transient gifts: I have this gift liberally dispensed to me of God, saith one, and I have that gift liberally dispensed to me of God, saith another. I have health (saith one) and I have wealth, saith another; I have no changes, but constant prosperity, through my pollicy in winding with the times: I have esteem in the world, and successe in every thing I go about ortake in hand; therefore doubtlesse God loves me;<note place="margin">Thus from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences.</note> 
                  <hi>Ergo.</hi> Another looks higher than this, and saith, I have natural parts, and supernatural gifts libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally dispensed to me of God, above what
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:49225:95"/>
many others have: I have wit and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> more than many others: I have knowledg, and I have utterance, and herein excell many: I have esteem among the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wise, and a name to live: I have a form of Godlinesse, and a shadow of every grace of the Spirit, many Talents in my hand, and hence conclude, God doubtlesse loves me, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he hates, <hi>Ergo.</hi> But neither of these ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue well for their sonneship, nor their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal estate; for no where doth the Scripture make any of these signs of Gods special love, or our adoption.</p>
               <p>It is evident by Scripture, That a <hi>Cain</hi> may prosper in the World as well as an <hi>Abel,</hi> and a glutton excell a <hi>Lazarus,</hi> in these contingent things: An <hi>Ahithophel,</hi> through his policy, may enjoy prosperity, while a <hi>Paul</hi> suffereth all adversity: A sonne of <hi>Beliall,</hi> may weare Purple and Scarlet, and fare deliciously every day, while a Sonne of God weares sheep-skins, and goats-skins, and lives upon Gods Providence: A <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> may have successe in his enterprises, as well as a <hi>Ioshua</hi> for a time, <hi>Philistins</hi> may triumph, while <hi>Israelites</hi> are led captive: A <hi>Iudas</hi> may have as good natural parts, and supernatural transient gifts, as a <hi>Paul,</hi> or a <hi>Iohn,</hi> as a <hi>chosen vessell</hi> or a <hi>beloved Disciple,</hi> yea, happily more: A <hi>Iesabell</hi> may be as beautifull in the eye of man, as a <hi>Rebeckah</hi>: A <hi>Pharisee</hi> more exemplary in a form of Godlinesse, than a <hi>Nathaniel</hi>: an Hipocrite may be more like a beloved Child of God, in his own eyes, and other mens too, than a true Child of God. A foolish Virgin may have as faire a Lamp in her hand, as a wise. By all
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:49225:95"/>
which it is evident, That none of these things, are sufficient to denominate a man, beloved of God, after a special manner, nor to render him an Adopted Son of God.</p>
               <p>In these words the Apostle lays before us, things quite contrary to these (to wit) <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement</hi> and <hi>scourging,</hi> as signs of Gods love; Here is love written in Characters, a hand that every one cannot read, a hand that few can read right; Here is love wrapped up in a rod, which none but a loving and beloved child, can draw out, or well apprehend; none but a child, savingly indued with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his Heavenly Father, can see his love, when he feels his rod, or argue his sonneship,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.32.</note> from his chastisement. To fetch an evidence of Gods Love, and a mans own Adoption from Gods <hi>Chastisements</hi> and <hi>Scourgings,</hi> is peculiar to a Child of God, and it is his prerogative, thus to do.</p>
               <p>It is not every Adopted Child of God nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that can thus argue his sonneship; I am <hi>Chastised</hi> of God, therefore I am <hi>beloved</hi> of him; I am <hi>scourged</hi> more than many others, therefore doubtlesse I am beloved more than others: It must be a child, grown to some maturity in grace, that must thus conclude; <hi>Whom the Lord loveth, he correcteth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Love, as attributed unto God, is not a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; as it is in man, but an effect of tree grace, and it is either more generall or more speciall: Of the more generall Love of God towards man, we read in <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.21. where it is said, of the young man that came to Christ, <hi>That Iesus beholding him, loved him.</hi> Of the more speciall Love of God towards some, we
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49225:96"/>
read <hi>Ierem.</hi> 31.3. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.1.</p>
               <p>The more generall, or common Love of God, is manifested in, and by his common gifts and dispensations, such as the young man that came to Christ was indued with (to wit) great place in the World, great possessions, morall righteousnesse, desire of, and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after eternall life, with the injoyment of temporall felicity, and predominate corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But the more speciall Love of God towards man, is manifested in, and by his <hi>Fatherly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements and scourgings,</hi> as this Text tels us, <hi>Whom the Lord loveth, he chastiseth,</hi> &amp;c, <hi>Whom the Lord loveth</hi>] after a speciall manner, he sooner, or later certainly chastiseth; <hi>He scourgeth every sonne whom he receiveth unto glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Chastisements of God, are many for number, various for kind, differing in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, duration, and immediate causes; but my purpose is not to discuss these, but to consider, when Gods <hi>Chastisements,</hi> of what kind soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, are sure and certain pledges of his more speciall and eternall Love towards a man; which to find out, I will premise these foure things.</p>
               <p>First, That <hi>Chastisements</hi> and sufferings from God, are not pledges of Divine love towards all: A man may be <hi>Chastised</hi> of God, and yet not be beloved of God, but hated, as <hi>Esau</hi> was; <hi>All things</hi> saith <hi>Solomon, come alike to all, and if all things,</hi> then <hi>Chastisements</hi> alike to all; <hi>Eliphaz</hi> tels us, <hi>That a man is born to trouble</hi> (it is as incident to him) <hi>as to the sparks
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49225:96"/>
to fly upward,</hi> Job 5.7. Troubles are <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements</hi>; and these do not argue love to all that are visited with them.</p>
               <p>The second thing premised, is this; That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Chastisements</hi> and <hi>scourgings,</hi> are not pledges of Gods Love to all, yet they are to some. <hi>Thou in very faithfulnesse hast afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me,</hi> saith the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> Psal. 119.75.</p>
               <p>The third thing premised is; Who they are to whom <hi>Chastisements</hi> and <hi>scourgings</hi> are pledges of Divine love? they are pledges of Divine love to them and to them only, to whom all things work together for good (to wit) to the Adopted Children of God;<note place="margin">To them that love God.</note> 
                  <hi>When we are judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world,</hi> saith an Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Son of God, of himself and his brethren, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing premised is; When <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements</hi> and <hi>Scourgings</hi> are pledges of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love, and that is, when they are sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Sanctified <hi>chastisements,</hi> and they only, are pledges of Gods speciall love toward man.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N these words, the Apostle briefly layes before us another and a higher Evidence of our Salvation (to wit) suffering. Heaven the Kingdom of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, where Jesus Christ reigns, is here promised to sufferers: But to find out, what kind of sufferers they are, to whom this great reward is promised, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult with other Scriptures, for it is not to all kind of sufferers, that this promise is made.</p>
               <p>Before I speak of the kind of suffering, here spoken of, I shall here note foure or five things.</p>
               <p>First, That suffering is a lesson very hard to flesh and blood to learn; which the Apostle knowing, as a wise scholemaster, sets before us, his schoolers, that which we all naturally
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49225:100"/>
desire (to wit) soveraignty, as the reward of this service, as a motive to quicken our dull hearts to buckle to our duty. <hi>If we suffer we shall also reign with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Active Obedience is a lesson hard to learn; passive Obedience is a lesson harder to flesh and blood to learn; neither of them can we learn to any purpose, unlesse Christ be our schoolemaster, but both of them will Christ teach us, so far forth as he sees it necessary for us, if he once undertake the work.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Suffering is of divers sorts, good or bad, according as the true cause of it is; a man may suffer for well doing, or for evill doing, it is to sufferers for well-doing, not to sufferers for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill doing that the Crown is promised.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Suffering is either just, or unjust; suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is alwayes just from God, but not alwayes just from men, it is not to just suffering, but to unjust suffering from men, that this promise is made.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is not to sufferers for the evill of sinne, nor to sufferers of the evill of sinne, to which the Crown is promised: But to sufferers of the evill of punishment for the avoiding of the evill of sinne, that it is promised, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ppears by comparing this Text with some others; <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> explains <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning here, touching suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.14. <hi>If ye suffer for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse sake, happy are ye,</hi> Chap. 4.14. <hi>If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye,</hi> &amp;c. Christ concurreth in this, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.10, 11, 12, &amp; 19.29. Hence it is evident, That it is not to all kind of suffering, but only to Gospel-suffering, that this great
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:49225:100"/>
reward is promised.</p>
               <p>I will not here stand to distinguish between suffering for righteousnesse sake, and suffering for Christs sake, or for his name sake, but leave it for them whose proper worke it is.</p>
               <p n="1">1. But here note, 1. That the sufferings of the Gospell comprehend both the Doctrine of the Gospell,<note place="margin">Gospell-doctrine, Gospell-Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, Gospell-Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</note> and the Discipline of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and Gospell-Conversation, and a man is a sufferer for the Gospel, that suffers in the defence of either of these, or for either.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And secondly. Note, That it is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering as an evill doer, but suffering as a Christian, that denominates an heir of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; <hi>Let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evill-doer,</hi> saith the Apostle; <hi>Yet if any man suffer</hi> (as a Christian) <hi>let him not be ashamed, but let him glorifie God on this behalfe,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.15, 16. Hence it is evident, That it is to him only that suffers as a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, that this promise of reigning with Christ is made; The Apostles meaning in this Text then, is, That if we <hi>suffer</hi> as Christians, <hi>we shall reign with him in glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Quest. <hi>But what is it to suffer as a Christian? or when may a man be said to suffer as a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> To suffer as a Christian, is to suffer as Christ did suffer; and a man may be said to suffer, as a Christian, when he is truly confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to Christ in suffering.</p>
               <p>Christ suffered for the Will of his Father, for the fulfilling of the Will of his Father, and he suffered according to the Will of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; now when a man doth these two, when
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49225:101"/>
he suffers for the Will of Christ, and suffers according to the Will of Christ, then doth he suffer as Christ did, then may he be said to be conformable unto Christ in suffering, and to suffer, as a Christian.</p>
               <p>A man then suffers for the Will of Christ, when he suffers for doing that which Christ would have him to do, or for refusing that which Christ would not have him to do.</p>
               <p>A man then suffers, according to the Will of Christ, when he suffers as the Word of God requires him to suffer, (<hi>viz.</hi>) when he suffers out of Love to God, and suffers beleevingly, patiently, joyfully, couragiously, and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veringly; for confcience towards God, that God may have honour thereby, and glorifies God for suffering.</p>
               <p>My purpose is not to enter upon an accute discourse of either of these, but briefly to assert what I think necessary for the right understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, as God shall inable me.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is the Will of Christ, that he that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers for his Will, should suffer out of love to his Will, and he that doth suffer for the Will of Christ, and doth not suffer out of love to the Will of Christ, doth not suffer according to the Will of Christ, This is evident by the Language of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. <hi>Though I give my body to be burned, and have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ot love, it profiteth me nothing</hi>; it is as if the Apostle had said, it is the Will of Christ, that I should suffer out of love to him, and if I do not thus, all my suffering is worth nothing, it is not according to the Will of Christ, nor worth any thing in Gods account; it comes to just no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at last, it profiteth me nothing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>

                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> all our active obedience, so all our pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive obedience, must spring out of love to God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note.</hi>
                  </note> as the efficient cause of it, else it is worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is the Will of Christ, that he that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers for his will, should suffer beleevingly; this appears thus, It is the Will of Christ, that he that suffers for his Will, should suffer patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, joyfully, couragiously and perseveringly, but this a man cannot possibly do, except he beleeve; therefore it follows by necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, that it is the Will of Christ, that he that suffers for his Will, should suffer beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. This is also evident by Scripture, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.1. where Christ making a speech <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>o his Disciples to fit them for suffering, bids them beleeve, thereby declaring, that his Will was, that they should suffer beleevingly; and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating, <hi>That if they did not suffer beleevingly, they did not suffer according to his will, although they suffered for his will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A man may be then said to suffer beleeving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when he by faith committeth <hi>the keeping of his soul unto God in well-doing,</hi> as the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> speaks; when he beleeves that Christ will be with him in all his sufferings, strengthen him to suffer, carry him through all that he cals him to suffer, and abundantly reward all his sufferings for his sake, according to his Word.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is the Will of Christ, that he that suffers for his will should suffer patiently; God cals for patience in suffering; <hi>Be patient in tribulation,</hi> Rom. 12.12. <hi>In your patience, possesse ye your souls,</hi> Luk. 21.19. <hi>We should follow Christ in patient suffering,</hi> saith the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49225:102"/>
Apostle,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.21, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>for even hereunto are we called</hi>: Hence it is evident, That he that suffers for the will of Christ, doth not suffer according to the will of Christ, except he suffer patiently.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Divine patience, What?</note>Divine patience, or patience considered, as a divine quality, is the issue and creame of many graces; It is a Diamond in the midst of a Triangle, (to wit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> a vertue between stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, despising the chastisement of the Lord, and fainting under it; it is a grace which keeps a man quiet within, when all things are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blous, and very unquiet without; it is a grace which possesses a man of himself, when dispos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of all earthly comforts; it is a speciall work of the Spirit of God in the soul, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling a man not stupidly, but quietly to bear whatsoever God lays upon him, without fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling murmuring, or repining, against God or man, in heart or in tongue, or fainting under his chastising hand.</p>
               <p>When it is thus with a sufferer for Christ, then may he be said to suffer according to the will of Christ in this particular (to wit) patiently.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Christ requires joy in sufferers for his will; <hi>Count it all joy</hi>

               <p>The persons sealed, by the holy Spirit of God, are the Elect of God, true believers, as the Apostle intimates by that particle [<hi>Ye] whereby [Ye] are sealed,</hi> speaking of true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.

of our redemption, unto the day of the redemption of our bodies from corruption, and the fruition of the redemption of our souls and bodies from Hell, by Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Sealing is a metaphor taken from Merchants, who use to seal their own wares, for speciall ends.</p>
               <p>The divine seales of God, are of a double kind, and of a double use; they are of a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble kind, they are either externall, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; outward or inward; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>. Externall, or outward, and such a seal was Circumcision in the time of the Law, it is so called by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, <hi>Rom</hi> 4.11. And such are our Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Baptism, and the Lords Supper, now in the daies of the Gospel.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Internall, or inward; the internall or inward seal of God, is the seal of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, metaphorically so called; and this is that which this Text points at.</p>
               <p>Seales are of a double use, they serve to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate, and to confirme; they signifie, and ratifie; I speak after the manner of men; Gods seales do no less, they demonstrate, they confirme; But Gods externall seales, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the internall seal of the Spirit of God, cannot assure any soul, of the speciall love of God, nor of his Adoption; many outwardly sealed go to Hell, the outward seales alone, cannot seal any soul unto the day of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; It is the inward seal of the holy Spirit of God, that seales us unto the day of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as this Text tells us, <hi>Grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.</hi>

               <p>The internall, or inward divine seal of the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:49225:106"/>
Spirit of God, is twofold, Demonstrative, or Confirmative; The holy Spirit of God seals the Elect to the day of redemption two wayes, 1. With a seal of Demonstration, 2. With a seal of Confirmation.</p>
               <p>The seal of Demonstration; set by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, I call that a speciall work of the holy Spirit of God, whereby a sinfull soul is truly regenerated, and the Image of God stamped upon him.</p>
               <p>The seal of Confirmation, I call that a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall work of the holy Spirit of God within us, whereby we are perswaded and assured, after an immediate manner, that we are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, adopted in Christ, and beloved with an everlasting love.</p>
               <p>Both these seales agree in their efficient cause, for they are both the speciall workes of the holy Spirit of God, whereby the soul is marked for, and assured of eternall happiness, when this life is ended.</p>
               <p>Of the first of these seales (to wit) the seal of Demonstration, I shall speak something from this Text, as God shall enable me; and somewhat of the other (to wit) the seal of Confirmation from another Text, if the Lord permit, and so conclude this work.</p>
               <p>Before I speak further of this seal of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, or the appearances of it, I will here premise six things.</p>
               <p>First, That as a Merchant sets his seal upon his wares, by which he demonstrates such and such wares to be his, and distinguisheth them from all other; so God sets his seal upon his people (to wit) this seal of regeneration, by which he demonstrates them to be his, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguisheth
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:49225:107"/>
them from all the people in the world, profane, morall, hypocriticall: This I may call Gods broad-seal, sealing a soul to the day of redemption.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This seal God sets upon all his wares; all his adopted children, are sooner or later sealed with this seal: every reall Saint, every one that is effectually called, hath this seal of Demonstration set upon him, regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration wrought in him, Gods Image stamped upon him. But all the children of God have not this in like measure, the impression is not alike visible in all, neither to the parties themselves, nor to others; some bear this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, as babes; others, as men grown up to some maturity; all Gods adopted children bear this impression truly, but none of them perfectly in this life.</p>
               <p>The third thing premised is this, That this seal of Demonstration (to wit) true regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is of absolute necessity unto salvation; for, <hi>Without holiness no man shall see the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12.14.<note place="margin">This Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Christ will own none of these wares for his, in that other world, whom he doth not thus seal in this world, it stands not with his justice to own such.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing premised is this, That this seal of regeneration demonstrates to God, to man, to others, and to a mans self, except in some <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Viz.</hi> In case of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion.</note> cases, that he is Gods; <hi>He hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen us in him, before the foundation of the world, through sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the Truth,</hi> 2 Thes. 2.13.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:49225:107"/>Fifthly, This seal of regeneration,<note place="margin">Such a seal was set upon those, mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Phil. 4.3. whose names the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle judged were in the Book of Life.</note> is such as others may discern; therefore I call it, a seal of demonstration: The Image of God, if once stamped in truth upon the soul, cannot be hid no more, than fire in a mans bosome; the love of God in the heart, will shew it self in the outward man; Nay, this seal of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is many times more obvious unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, than unto the parties themselves: This seal is so lively stamped on some of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that it shews it self very eminently in the eies of others, when they that have it, cannot, nor will not, behold it in themselves.</p>
               <p>The sixth and last thing premised is this, That this seal of regeneration, whereever it is truly stamped by the holy Spirit of God,<note place="margin">The sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Spirit, are called, The ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest of the Spirit, 2 Cor. 5.5.</note> is Gods mark, and the soules earnest for Heavens eternity; <hi>The Lord hath set apart him that is godly for himself,</hi> Psal. 4.3. The person thus sealed is a sequestred person, sequestred for the Lords use, <hi>sealed unto the day of redemption</hi>; Where note, That this seal of regeneration, doth confirme and make sure the love of God unto the person on which it is set, as well as the other, though not alwayes to the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of the person.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But Satan doth many times coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit this seal, and thereby cheats and cosens many a soul; He counterfeiteth holiness, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades the soul, that is but seemingly regenerate, that he is truly regenerate; and him that hath but civill holiness, that he hath saving holiness; and by this sophistry of his, cheats and undoth many a soul; How shall I then come truly to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, whether the demonstrative seal, set upon my self, be indeed the seal of the holy Spirit of God<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:49225:108"/>
or but the counterfeit set by Satan?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Wheresoever there is true regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration wrought by the holy Spirit of God, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans seal, which is upon our soules, as we come into the world, is cancelled, corruption is not barely restrained, but mortified; <hi>The body is dead, because of sinne,</hi> as the Scripture speaks; the soul is bent against every sinne, it allows not it self in any known sinne,<note place="margin">Hates fin for its evil nature, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God hates it.</note> it hates all sin, but where Satan counterfeits this seal, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is but restrained, the heart loves it still, and cherisheth some one sinne or other.</p>

               <p>But Satans counterfeit seal of Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, stamps his own image; he is seemingly an Angel of light, whilest really a Devil; and he that is thus sealed by Satan, resembles him in this, he is a seeming Saint, a reall Devil; So Christ spake of <hi>Iudas, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a Devil?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that is thus sealed by Satan, hath Holiness painted on his outside, but wickedness graven on his heart, as is evident in the Scribes and Pharisees, who were thus sealed by Satan; they were <hi>outwardly holy</hi> (as Christ shews at large, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.) <hi>but inwardly very ugly</hi> and <hi>rotten,</hi> and therefore calls them, <hi>whited sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres,</hi> not sealed soules.</p>
               <p>Civill Holiness may, and many times doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a man to carry himself civilly, and holily in the eies of men; but saving Holiness makes a man studious, and carefull to approve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self unto God, in his very thoughts and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, and in the motions of his heart, as well as the motions of the outward man; yea, this is that which he is most carefull of, and indust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious about, that is sealed by the holy Spirit of God, his chief work is within doors; his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall care, desire and endeavour, is to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his heart unto God, and so walk, that he may be accepted of him, and glorifie him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:49225:109"/>Then again, civill Holiness springs from morall principles,<note place="margin">Saving Holiness springs from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</note> good education, and the like; but saving Holiness springs from love: love to God is the root out of which it springs, as the Apostle shews, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4.

               <p>The soul that is thus sealed by the holy Spirit of God, dares not sunder what God hath cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled together (to wit) Holiness towards God, and Righteousness towards men: a man truly regenerate, is carefull of both, witness <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 24.16.

               <p>In fine, He that is thus sealed by the holy Spirit of God, is one that holds on his way, and grows in grace. I joyn these together, so doth <hi>Iob, The righteous shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger,</hi> Job 17.9. This seal of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, hath this priveledge, above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all other seales, the impression which it makes remaineth and increaseth. This seal of Demonstration, if once truly stamped, by the Spirit of God, on a soul, abideth there, the impression never weares out; <hi>This annointing abideth,</hi> as <hi>Iohn</hi> speakes, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.27. Truth of grace in the heart, and it <hi>abideth there,</hi> and <hi>the heart abideth in the truth</hi>; When God gives a man truth of grace, he gives it him, to have and to hold for ever; the soul thus sealed beares in it the marks of the Lord Jesus unto the death, and most eminently after death in glory; This seal of the holy Spirit of God is lasting, and everlasting; True regeneration, <hi>seales a man to the day of redemption,</hi> but this it could not do, were it not a lasting sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
               <p>This may suffice to discerne the reality of this seal of Demonstration by (to wit) true regeneration, and to distinguish it from that counterfeit set by Satan; I do not intend an innumeration of the qualifications and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of a regenerate person here, but only endeavour to discry him, and distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him, and one but seemingly regenerate,

promise,</hi> saith the Apostle, speaking of this seal, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. Hence it is evident, That a man is first a true believer, he hath first a true faith, a true and reall interest in Christ; He is justified, and sanctified, and made a new Creature, before thus sealed by the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God. Here I desire the Reader to note two or three things.</p>
               <p>First, That it is a true believer only,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note.</hi>
                  </note> that is capable of this seal of the holy Spirit of God, <hi>He that believeth on the Sonne of God hath the witness in himself,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.10. He only that believeth aright, hath this witness of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God in himself, he only that hath a justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiing faith, is thus sealed by the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly note, That this testimony of the Spirit of God is one of the kisses of Christs mouth, which the Church prayes for, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.2. But Christ doth not thus kiss and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his Children, when they be all filthy and nasty, he doth first cleanse them by his blood, and by his Spirit, justifie them and sanctifie them, renew and heavenlize them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly note this, That the Spirit, and the water and the blood, do concur in their testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, where the Spirit of God doth be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly note, That the blood and the water may, and sometimes do, bear witness, where the Spirit of God doth not thus bear witness with our spirits, that we are the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted children of God: But the Spir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>t of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:49225:113"/>
God doth never thus bear witness, where the blood, and the water do not bear witness. Christs blood doth satisfie for sinne, and his Spirit cleanse from sinne, wheresoever his Spirit doth thus bear witness; He therefore that thinks he is sealed by the Spirit of God with a seal of Confirmation, and yet is not sealed with the seal of Demonstration, is but deluded and bewitched by Satan, and in a fools Paradice.</p>
               <p>In the third place, whomsoever the holy Spirit of God doth seal, with a seal of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, whomsoever he doth assure of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love of God towards him, he doth qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie with the disposition of a son (to wit) love to his heavenly Father, fear of offending him, desire, care, and endeavour to walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in all wel-pleasing, obeying his voice out of love,<note place="margin">All Gods adopted Children, have <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi>'s por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, love, speciall love, but all of them have not <hi>Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>'s double portion (to wit) love, and the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it; This is a choice favour, a high priviledg.</note> mourning for its offences, and depending on God its heavenly Father for all things.</p>
               <p>The soul thus sealed apprehends much love in God, and this generates much love in it towards God again, and the things of God; this, saith this soul, is no common favour, but a singular; all of my Brethren eat not of this bread, wear not this raiment; this is <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>'s portion, and it calls for much love from me, much filial fear and care, more duty and better done. And hence it comes to pass, that this soul grows not careless and fearless, but more carefull and conscionable in duty, and tender of doing any thing that may displease God, <hi>grieve the holy Spirit of God, whereby he is sealed; quench the motions thereof,</hi> or cause him to suspend his testimony.</p>
               <p>The soul thus sealed by the holy Spirit of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:49225:113"/>
God, is never better pleased with it self, than when it can weep over Christ, whom it hath pierced, and find Christ bleed over it; it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver well, but when in this frame, it desires nothing more than such a frame of spirit, as cannot look upon sinne, but it sighs for sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, nor upon its Saviour, but it smiles for joy.</p>
               <p>When Christ thus imparts himself to the soul, this soul speaks to Christ, as God once spake to <hi>Abraham, Now I know that thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest me, seeing thou hast not with-held from me, thy sonne, thine only sonne, whom thou lovest,</hi> said God to <hi>Abraham:</hi> So saith this soul to Christ, now I know that thou lovest me, seeing thou hast not with-held from me this grace that is so lovely in thy sight, but when it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find Christ thus present with it, it is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The soul that hath this seal,<note place="margin">He hath the spirit ofprayer, though not the gift of prayer</note> or testimony of the Spirit of God, hath a spirit of prayer; in whomsoever the Spirit of God is a Spirit of adoption, he is also a Spirit of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; whomsoever the Spirit of God doth assure of the fatherly love of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, he enables to <hi>cry Abba, Father, and maketh request for him with unutterable Rhetorick; he enables the soul to pour it self forth to God, in supplication and thanksgiving</hi>; this is evident by <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15, 26.</p>
               <p>The soul thus sealed by the Spirit of God, longs after, and delights in, approaches to God, and God approaches to it in all his holy Ordinances; <hi>Let me see his countenance, let me hear his voice,</hi> saith the soul thus sealed, <hi>for sweet is his countenance, and his voice pleasant,</hi>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:49225:114"/>
it delights to meditate on, and walk with its God, it doth not leave off duty, but performs it more conscionably and spiritually.</p>

                  </gap>dent by the language of the Apostle, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.6. After the <hi>Colossians</hi> knew <hi>the grace of God in truth, they were more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in righteousness, than ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sound assurance of the love of God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces care and industry, in the work and wayes of God, as is evident by the language of the Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1, 8. <hi>We know, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,</hi> saith he of himself, and other Believers; and what follows? <hi>Therefore we labour, that whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him,</hi> ver. 9. These mens assurance produced not carelesness and sloth, but care and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, and it is the property of good assurance so to do.</p>
               <p>This condemns that Popish Tenet, That assurance of salvation is the destroyer of all piety and charity.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note.</hi>
                  </note> And it condemns that assurance that is fruitless or careless.</p>
               <p>In the sixt place, Sound assurance produces joy, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. Faith of evidence and joy, are inseperably united, they are Twins born at once, and if assurance die, joy dies with it; In whomsoever the Spirit of God is a Spirit of Confirmation, he is a Spirit of Consolation; the soul that is assured of the love of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, cannot but rejoyce in it; spiritual Consolation doth not spring so naturally from any thing, as it doth out of the witness of the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:49225:114"/>
Spirit; joy may be (I mean some kind of joy) where assurance is wanting, but assurance ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver goes without joy, spirituall joy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is a generation</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> tels us) <hi>which in the midst of laughter, their heart is sad; and there is a generation, which in the midst of sadnesse, their heart rejoyceth</hi>; And those which are thus sealed by the holy Spirit of God are they, such is the power of sound assurance, that it will make (I mean instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally) the heart to joy, whilst the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man sorrows; it will fill the heart, <hi>with joy unspeakable, and full of glory, whilst the outward man is filled with shame and contempt</hi>; yea<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> sound assurance is for the most part, then strongest, and shews it self with most vigor and light somenesse within, when the greatest damp of outward discomforts, lye upon the person, and the world most frowns upon him, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutes him, for his frowardnesse and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in the cause of God. When <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> had much cause to sigh, for their usage amongst men, they then <hi>sang and rejoyced,</hi> Act. 16.25. When the Apostles <hi>did suffer shame for Christ,</hi> then did they most <hi>rejoyce,</hi> Act. 5.41. When the People of God were <hi>spoiled of their goods, and spoiled in their persons, then did they rejoyce</hi>; and whence sprang their joy in this disconsolate condition, but from their assurance? <hi>They took joyfully the spoiling of their goods [knowing] that they had in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, a better, and induring substance,</hi> Heb. 10.34.</p>
               <p>Assurance of Gods favour, produceth joy according to its measure and degree, assurance of hope, produceth joy, assurance of faith,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:49225:115"/>
produceth more joy; <hi>The riches of the full as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of understanding,</hi> most of all.</p>
               <p>The joy that springs from assurance, is a heart strengthening joy, a life lenghtening joy, and a joy that no man can take from us, it is a soul inlarging, a shame despising, a God-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying, a world-overcoming, and a sin-over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> In the seventh place, Sound assurance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth humility; this seal of confirmation, when set by the Spirit of God, doth work the soul to more humility of mind, then usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally is in others; The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> is a notable instance hereof, he was thus sealed by the holy Spirit of God, when he said, <hi>I am perswaded that neither Death nor Lfe, Angels, Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, nor Powers, nor any other thing, shall be able to separate me, from the Love of God, which is in Christ Iesus our Lord; and then did be serve the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears,</hi> as himself saith, <hi>Act</hi> 20.19.

Yet was he not hereby taken off from, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incited to a holy jealousie of, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse over himself and all his wayes, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the forecited place.</p>

               <p>Sound assurance is not the destroyer, but the Nurse of holy jealousie and watchfulnesse; Neither is holy jealousie an enemy to, but a preserver of sound assurance.</p>
               <p>In the ninth place, Sound assurance works <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> the heart to more contempt of the world, and the things of the world, then others usually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to, and it doth mightily quicken and spur forward the soul to more holinesse, hatred of sinne, and zeal, and courage in the cause of God; <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> are pregnant exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of this; of the effects of this seal in <hi>Moses,</hi> we may read in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 24, 25, 26, 27. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.31, 32 and in <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 3. <hi>v.</hi> 7, to 15. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 19, to 25.</p>
               <p>In the tenth place, Sound assurance will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> bide the trial, and it is willing to be tried; it shuns not the light, but comes to the light, that its reality might be made manifest.</p>
               <p>Sound assurance is not usually injoyed long <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> without some buffetings of Satan; the soul that is t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The soul thus sealed by the Spirit of God, longs to be with God, <hi>yet labours to wait pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently for him, all the daies of his appointed time; Iob</hi> was thus sealed by the Spirit of God, when he said, <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth</hi>; he was assured that Christ was his Redeemer, and he longed to be with him, yet patiently waits for him, not a day or two, but all the daies of his appointed time, <hi>Iob</hi> 14.14.</p>
               <p>He that presumeth, many times makes more haste, than good speed; <hi>But he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth maketh not haste.</hi>

               <p>Finally, He that is thus sealed by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> is also led by the Spirit of God, (mark that) He is led by the Spirit of God, after a speciall manner, <hi>As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sonnes of God,</hi> saith the Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14. <hi>so many as are led by the Spirit of God as a sanctifier,</hi> (and no more, have good ground to conclude) <hi>they are the Children of God,</hi> by this rule of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, and so consequently to conclude, That the testimony that they have of their adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (if any) is the testimony of the Spirit of God.</p>

               <p>The soul that is thus sealed by the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God (to wit) with the seal of demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, and the seal of Confirmation.</p>

               <p>The soul that is by the Spirit of God, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded and assured of the Fatherly Love of God, counts not that it hath enough, but longs still to be more and more confirmed in it; the tast that it hath of the sweetnesse and goodnesse of this wine, makes it long to drink deeper of it, and to desire <hi>flaggons</hi> of it, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2 5.

                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:49225:118"/>But contrary wise, the Soul in which Satan counterfeits these seales of the Spirit of God, when it is once thus sealed by him, is many times ready to say as <hi>Esau, I have enough</hi>; and with <hi>Laodicea, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing,</hi> neither Grace, Ordinances, nor Ministers; leaves Manna, and loaths it, declines and deserts the Ordinances, Churches, and Ministers of Christ, and fals off from, or (at least) grows cold and customary in duty, which evidently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates it to be Satans seal, and not the seal of the holy Spirit of God, that is upon it.</p>

               <p>Whosoever therefore thinks himself sealed by the holy Spirit of God, with a seal of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, and with a seal of confirmation, and yet doth not these three things, is deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and deceiveth his own heart; it is Satans seal, and not Gods, that is upon him; his sealing is a sealing to the day of destruction, not a seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the day of redemption.</p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly note. That evidence of our interest in God and Christ, is a gift of Gods free grace, and it dependeth upon Gods free Will; I do not remember any particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise in the Bible, that God hath made (ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily) to give this blessing of assurance unto his people, or to continue it unto them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, unto whom he gives it; on whomsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver God bestows this grace of Assurance, it is over and above what he hath covenanted with his People to give them; and I call it (a gift of free grace) in this respect; God gives this blessing at pleasure, and he may take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way at pleasure; we hold it as Tenants at will, and when the Lord pleaseth, he may reverse his grant, or suspend his favour.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, That God usually, (I do not say alwayes) continues this blessing, or suspends it, according to the use or abuse of it; God varies his carriage towards the Creature in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect hereof, as the Creature varies its carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age towards him; though Gods Love towards his People be alwayes the same, yet his disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ries of it are not alwayes the same; though the Spirit of God be alwayes a leader to his People, yet be is not alwayes a witnessor to them; the Spirit of God many times suspends his testimony from those, to whom he continues his guidance.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, It behooveth every one there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb facs="tcp:49225:120"/>
to whom the Lord vouchsafeth this royall favour, to study how to carry himself, so that he may still enjoy it, this hath been my work and indeavour ever since the Lord hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed me any sence of his Love, and evidence of my interest in Christ, for this purpose I have propounded to my self, and shall here briefly commend to the Reader, these rules, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Having once gotten any good assurance of the Love of God, and thy own salvation, thus do; Lay up this Jewell safe in the Cabbinet of a tender Conscience.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Set a guard about it, guard it with the feare of God, and spirituall watchfulnesse; <hi>In the feare of the Lord is strong confidence.</hi>

            <p>Thus much of the first sort of rules<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> which are purely negative, and respect things to be avoided, by him that would keep his evidence: I shall now speak of the 2. sort of rules, which respect things to be done, by those that having attained some good Evidence for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, desire to keep and retain it.</p>

            <p n="9">9. If thou wouldst still retain thy assurance, then labour to keep a holy jealousie over thy self, and over all thy performances, and wayes; holy jealousie is no destroyer, but a nourisher and strengthener of good assurance.</p>

God many times deserts his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and hides his face from them, because they do not profit by lesser Chastisements; he useth greater rods, because lesser will not serve the turn: Labour therefore to discern Gods design in every stroke of his, and to answer Gods ends in every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
            <p n="11">11. In the next place, If thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est still injoy thy assurance, then call thy selfe often to account, and when thou es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piest any failings in thy selfe, speedily hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thy self before the Lord for them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new Faith and Repentance, seek pardon and reconciliation, apply the Blood of Christ for thy cure, let not Conscience lye under the guilt of any known sinne unrepented of; <hi>If our hearts condemne us not, then have we confid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
