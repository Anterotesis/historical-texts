            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE bleſſed &amp; holy Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> (Right Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) penning and publiſhing the Heauenlye ſtory and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, doth alſo dedicate the ſame to one <hi>Theophilus,</hi> a Noble and famous man, of ſingular credit and authority. The reaſon and
<pb facs="tcp:26165:3"/>
cauſe that mooued him thereto, is becauſe in thoſe times, the pureneſſe of the Goſpell was hindred, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, whereby many erroures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be ſpreade and allowed: and therefore in great Wiſdom it pleaſed the holy Ghoſt, not onely to write a faithfull, ſure, and perfect ſtory: but alſo to offer and preſent the cuſtodie and defence of the ſame, to one of Religion and Povver. The verye ſame cauſe, partly hath mooued me at this time, to bee ſo bolde as to offer and Dedicate this poore and ſimple teſtimony of my trauaile to your Honoures. For although I doe confeſſe, vvee liue vnder a Gracious Prince (whome the Lorde long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to his glory, to the ſhame and confuſion of his enemies, and to the dayly profit of his Church) although (I ſay) we liue in ſo peaceable, happy, and gracious a time, vnder the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing ſtate of the Goſpell; yet true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the deareſt Children of God, and the ſincerity of Religion, is ſubiect to bitter Perſecution. Theſe wordes at
<pb facs="tcp:26165:3"/>
the firſt may ſeeme verye greeuous, hard and haynous, and yet they are moſt certaine and true. The holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> writing to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> 4.29. ſpeaketh on this maner: As <hi>he that was borne after the Fleſh, perſecuted him that was borne after the Spirite</hi>; euen ſo is it nowe: hee ſpeaketh of <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and yet we do not reade in the ſcripture of any perſecution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, neither did <hi>Iſmael</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute his Brother <hi>Iſaac,</hi> with hande or ſworde, but that which is worſe, proudly &amp; arrogantly, he raiſed him ſelfe againſt him, mocking him, and as it were, treading vnder feete the promiſe of God. And this dealing by the apoſtle is cálled a perſecution, &amp; in deede there is not any perſecution more greeuous to the Children of God then this. Nowe who doth not dayly ſee, that the beſt Chriſtians, and the purenes of Religion are greatly perſecuted, by Papiſts, Atheiſts, and Hipocrites, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was by his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iſmael,</hi> And of all matters of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, I thinke there is ſcarſe any in
<pb facs="tcp:26165:4"/>
theſe dayes more generally hated of ſuch kind of men, then that, which is moſt altogether, &amp; almoſt only hand led in this ſimple Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For theſe &amp; ſuch like men, many of them can bee content with a common ordinarye profesſion, to heare Mattins and Euenſong, and ſometimes a Sermon, by ſuch men as they like of, but that there ſhould be any continuall courſe of the pure preaching of the worde of God, they can in no caſe allowe or like of. This I ſay, is hated, reiected and perſecuted ſo farre as may be, of the greater ſorte, and therefore not without cauſe haue I atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate this my labor, to your honors as ſpecial Patrons, &amp; defendors of the Lords cauſe, &amp; tried Friends and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorers of God &amp; his trueth. But yet this attempt may ſeem very raiſh and needles: For who am I, that I ſhould take vppon mee to ſet foorth and to publiſh any thing. The vnworthieſt I confeſſe of many hundreths, and the vnableſt of manye thouſands, and yet ſeeing many things more ſimple, leſſe
<pb facs="tcp:26165:4"/>
needefull and profitable, are not only ſuffered, but alowed to come abroad: I am not altogether diſcouraged, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iuſt cauſe to accuſe mee in this my ſimple enterpriſe. I know theſe be daies of knowledge &amp; learning, there bee greate ſtore of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and learned diuines in our land (whom I beſeech the Lorde to bleſſe, that they may asſiſt their weake bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, in the defence of this, and ſuch good cauſes,) and yet the two mites of the pore widow caſt into the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, amongeſt the great giftes of the wealthy, are not to be refuſed. I know your Honours be daily hearers of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and learned men, both in your houſes and abroad, you are acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the ſermons of profound &amp; deepe diuines, and ſuch as are mighty in the ſcriptures: notwithſtanding ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in my ſelf ſufficient trial &amp; expe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rience of your honors moſt curteous humble, &amp; fauorable dealing towards me, and alſo of ſome liking of my ſimple &amp; my poore trauelles in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching heretofore. I am not aſhamed
<pb facs="tcp:26165:5"/>
or afrayd after ſuch triall and proofe, to offer this ſo ſmall and ſimple a thing vnto your Honours. The great necesſity of the matter I deale with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, the care of Gods glory, the zeal of his houſe, the benefit that his church may haue by it, hath eſpecially moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me that it ſhould be publiſhed &amp; come abroad. Let not therefore hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites bee too raſh in iudging, the Lorde the ſearcher of the hearts and reynes knoweth my purpoſe and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, in preaching and publiſhing this matter. The cauſe that hath mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me to preſent it to your Honors, rather then to other, is the lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g proof and acquayntance of your honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble courteſies, and friendlye good will towards me, which for my part, I am neuer able to requite, for the which I thinke my ſelfe as long as breath is in me, moſte bound and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to your Honours. And here I offer this poore fruite of my trauaile, as ſome Teſtimony of good will and thankfulnes. And whereas wee are wont commonly to offer and preſent
<pb facs="tcp:26165:5"/>
to our deareſt Friendes, ſome giftes, as tokens of good will, or elſe of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial duety. Amongſt many great and precious preſentes, vvhich are no doubt giuen and preſented to your honours; I alſo offer this ſimple mite, and yet I hope more pleaſant and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the receiuers, then thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of gold or ſiluer, or any earthly thing whatſoeuer. And in deede, can there be any matter more ſweete and pleaſaunt, to the cheefe Patrons and Defenders of the Godly Preachers, and the word of God, then to heare of the necesſity, profite, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of preaching: which things, are ſet foorth plainly &amp; largely in this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Sermon. For howſoeuer many me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hate and abhorre this matter, and can in no caſe diſgeſt it: yet your honours zeale, courage, liking, goodwill and countenaunce, to this and other good cauſes is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly known and ſpreade abroad. A further reaſon why I pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe this Sermon, is becauſe there is ſome matter in it, for the which I haue beene in the country where I dwell, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>openly
<pb facs="tcp:26165:6"/>
ſlaundered and euill ſpoken off, and therefore to cleare my ſelfe from ſuch falſe reports, to ſatisfie my friends which are readie to anſwer in my cauſe, to let the enemies knowe, I haue ſpoken nothing whereof I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, but dare put it to the witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and teſtimonie of the Chriſtian reader: and alſo to reſolue more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the weaker ſort, in ſuch things as at the firſt ſeeme ſtrange and abſurd: for theſe and ſuch like cauſes, I ſay, I am content and willing that this my trauell come to light: although the whole or moſt part of this Sermon is vnſauory &amp; vnpleaſaunt to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſort, and ſpecially to the ignorant people, to the hypocrit, to the idol or dumb miniſter: yet this is that, which chiefly miſliketh and grieueth them; becauſe, both in the place where I pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched this Sermon, and alſo elſewhere, I ſayd and affirmed, that the miniſter which preacheth not, and hath not thoſe gyftes which the Lorde requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in his Miniſters, that ſuch a one is no Miniſter, approoued of GOD,
<pb facs="tcp:26165:6"/>
neyther hath anye right and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie from the Lorde, to myniſter his Sacramentes; which matter, howe ſtraunge and abſurde ſoeuer it ſeeme to ignoraunt and carnall men: yet I hope it is heere ſufficiently confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by authoritye and examples of the holy Scripture. I coulde alleadge further, the allowaunce and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of moſt famous and pure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, and ſuch as are gennerally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued and allowed of all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. Maſter <hi>IOHN CALVIN,</hi> about the latter ende of his Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme, which is allowed by her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties authoritie, ſayth in playne wordes, that the miniſtration of the Sacraments belongeth to them, who haue the charge to preache openly in the Church. For the preaching of Gods worde, and the miniſtration of the Sacraments, be things ioyntly belonging to one kind of office: theſe be his very words which are as plaine as may be. M: <hi>Rodolphus Gualter</hi> in his 118. Homely vpon <hi>Mark,</hi> ſpeaking of the inſtitution of the Lordes ſupper,
<pb facs="tcp:26165:7"/>
and of the right order in miniſtring that ſacrament, amongſt other things ſayth on this manner. <hi>Peccant qui coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam abſ<expan>

I might alleadge many other teſtimonies for this cauſe, not onely from the moſt worthy, Godly, and learned diuines, both old and new of other Nations: But alſo from famous Martyrs and Byſhops in this oure Lande, in their ſermons and writings, publiſhed and priuileged by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
<pb facs="tcp:26165:7"/>
I hope then ther is no cauſe why this doctrin ſhold not receiue a fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable intertainment &amp; allowance, as of your honors, ſo of al faithful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, hauing ſuch warrant from ſo pure and learned men, and from the teſtimony of the holy word. VVhat ſoeuer I ſpake in deliuering and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering this ſermon, I haue here ſet it down (ſo nere as I could remember) both in forme and matter.

was our duetie to doe.</hi> The holy Apoſtle and ſeruant of Chriſt in this place, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoucheth and confeſſeth in him ſelfe, the ſaying of his Maſter to be moſte true. For although amongſt many good workes, there is not a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent or better work, then the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the word of God (which was done moſt purely, effectually, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently by the Apoſtle) yet he is ſo farre from accounting it meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that he ſayth, a neceſſitie is layd vpon him, that duety bindeth him to do it. In the former verſes from the beginning of this Chapter. <hi>S. Paule</hi> ſheweth, and that with diligence and large copie of wordes, that beeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Corrinthians,</hi> he was con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tent to giue place to his owne right, to forbeare that which he might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully doe, to take no maintenaunce at all from them, leaſt he ſhould giue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of cauilling to the falſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: as though he vnder the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the calling of an Apoſtle, ſhould ſeeme to ſeeke his owne gaine and lucre. Amongſt other thinges he
<pb facs="tcp:26165:9"/>
hath ſayde, and that in the former verſe: <hi>It were better for me to dye then that any man ſhould make my reioycing in vaine.</hi> The which wordes may ſeeme to proceed and flow from an ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and vaineglorious ſpirite. And therefore it might be ſayde, What now <hi>Paule</hi>? What needes all this? Thou art wont to glory in Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and doſt thou now glory in thine owne doinges? To ſuch a queſtion or obiection the Apoſtle aunſweareth qualifiyng his former ſpeach, as if he ſhould ſay: Although it be an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent worke to preach the Goſpel, and that freely, yet take not my wordes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o, as though I repoſe any merite of ſaluation in this worke, for I am cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to it, and bound to it, by duety and commaundement from my maſter Chriſt. And if I doe it not I prouoke and procure the anger of God, and the ſentence of his curſe and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation on me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Woe bee to me if I preach not the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell:</hi> Of theſe words, being but a part of the verſe, I haue taken vpon me to
<pb facs="tcp:26165:10"/>
ſpeake at this time. From whence I meane by Gods grace to ſpeake of theſe three pointes. Firſt I will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome deſcription of preaching, that you may know what it is. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, I meane to prooue the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of preaching, and that euery Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is bound to preach.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I will ſhewe what they ought to preach. The firſt point as in many other places, ſo here it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but not fully ſet downe what it is, but in other places we may eaſily gather what it is. The ſecond is here named and prooued. For <hi>Saint Paule</hi> being a Miniſter, and ſaying, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>oe bee vnto mee, if I preach not the gospell,</hi> doth plainely affirme as much. The third is here ſet downe moſt plainly, the matter that we muſt preach of, namely the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>As touching the firſt, let vs ſee how the ſcripture ſpeaketh of it, as it is particularly and ſpecially applyed to the publique office of the Miniſter, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe I knowe this worde prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to haue a further and more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb facs="tcp:26165:10"/>
ſignification: But I ſpeake of it, as Chriſt and the Apoſtles doe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying it to the Miniſters. <hi>Saint Paul</hi> ſayth,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.3.</note> 
               <hi>He that prophecieth ſpeaketh vnto men to edifiyng,<note place="margin">2.

               <hi>Improoue, rebuke, exhort with all long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and doctrine.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Pet. 5.2.</note> The bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> as he receiued of his Maſter a charge to <hi>feed his flocke,</hi> ſo he exhorteth al other to do the ſame.</p>
            <p>The holy Euangeliſt <hi>Luke</hi> ſayth that Chriſt taught or preached in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth.</hi> He firſt reade,<note place="margin">Luk. 4.16.</note> then ſhut the booke, afterwarde he expounded that ſcripture which he read, and ſo apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to the hearers. By theſe and ſuch like places we may gather, that prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching properly as we ſpeake of it, is an expoſition and application of the ſcriptures, by the liuely voyce of the miniſter, to the edifiyng of the people: whereby it may eaſily appeare that reading is not preaching, nor yet ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in a miniſter approued of God.

As for reading, wee ſpeake not againſte it wee diſalowe it not, but account it a holye, lawfull, neceſſarye, and profitable meane, whereby greate good and benefite is wrought to the Church of God: but yet, it doth not follow y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is ſufficient in a miniſter, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it will ſerue ſimply of it ſelf in the publique congregation. The Lorde hath ſet downe another order, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth greater things at the handes of his ſpeciall ſeruaunts. But this matter ſhal appear more plain in the words following. For my purpoſe in this part is, only to ſhew you by ſome circumſtances and diſcriptions what preaching is, and that reading is not preaching, or at leaſt that kinde of
<pb facs="tcp:26165:11"/>
preaching, which the Lord requireth in his miniſters, as may appeare by comparing them together, and by v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſome apt ſimilitudes for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of this matter. The ſmell or ſight of meat doth good to the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry man, but it will not feede him, except he taſte of it: ſo by reading men may haue ſome ſmell of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but they ſhall neuer throughly taſte of it, without preaching,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.11.</note> and therefore it is called a feeding, as we hearde before and Preachers are counted Paſtors and feeders. Again, meate that is rawe and fat, maye bee called good, but it is not to bee eaten before it bee made readye and dreſſed: ſo are the Scriptures reade good, holy and pure, but not ſufficient foode for the people, without preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Againe, bare reading is as thogh one ſhould caſt a whole loafe, before them which want ſtrength to cut it,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.15.</note> Preaching is a cutting and diuiding of the breade of life, that euery one may haue his ſeueral portion. Again, bare reading without preaching is
<pb facs="tcp:26165:12"/>
euen as the huſbandman ſhould caſt whole ſtrikes and buſhels of Corne, on his Land together on heapes, not ſcattering of it.<note place="margin">Mat. 13.</note> Preaching is a ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and a ſowing of the ſeed. Again. bare reading is as though the Fiſher ſhould ſhuffle his nets on heapes, not opening them: Preaching is a wiſe opening, laying and handling of the Net.</p>
            <p>Bare reading is as one ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer good treaſures, and yet ſuche as were hid, ſhut vp &amp; faſt locked, &amp; could not beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e by: preching is an opening of the Treaſures, to the ioy of Gods Children. Reading is like to fire co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with Aſhes, which doth ſmally profite them that ſtand by it. Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is an opening and diſcouering of the fire. Let vs conſider one example amongſt many, for the further expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this matter.<note place="margin">Act. 8.27.</note> The Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine that Noble Treaſurer of <hi>Aethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opia,</hi> going to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> to worſhip God as he went, reade the ſcriptures, if reading wold haue ſerued his turn, <hi>Philip</hi> needed not to haue come to
<pb facs="tcp:26165:12"/>
him, but he vnderſtoode not before be had a guide, hee was not conuerted, neyther had he ſayth ſufficient to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, before hee hearde the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Worde, which in deede is that eſpeciall, effectuall, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and excellent ordinarye meane of fayth, as it appeareth more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fully in the next part of our text.</p>
            <p>Which beeing rightly waighed, confirmeth the greate neceſſitye of preaching, and prooueth that euery Miniſter ought to preach. <hi>Woe bee to me, if I preach not the Gospell.</hi> And why ſo? becauſe I am called to it, becauſe I am a Miniſter, becauſe the Lorde requireth it of me. Although Saint <hi>Paule</hi> and the other Apoſtles had pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges and prerogatiues, which we haue not, although we haue not fullye ſo large a commiſſion, as hee and they had: Although they did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinges, which we neither may, nor can doe: yet as touching the office of preaching, it appertaineth as well to vs as to them. And for the further
<pb facs="tcp:26165:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
proofe of this matter I will rehearſe ſome argumentes, which before I haue vſed in this place, adding di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers others to them.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1</hi> It is the commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Chriſt and the holy Apoſtles, therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Chriſt ſayd to his Apoſtles, <hi>Goe preach the Gospell.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mar. 16.15.</note> The which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, in this behalfe belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to all the miniſters of God. <hi>Saint Paule</hi> ſtraightly chargeth the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>Epheſus. <hi>Take heed vnto your ſelues, and to all the flocke, whereof the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt hath made you ouerſeers, to feede the Church of God, which he hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with his own bloud.</hi>
               </hi> And moſt weigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tily of al, he requireth it in the place already alleadged, he leaueth it not as a thing indifferent, that may be done, or vndone, but ſpeaketh with a wonderful and mighty proteſtation, he ioyneth the Scripture and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching togeather. For hauing before in the former Chapiter, ſet foorth the great profit of the ſcriptures, ſtraight waye hee neceſſarilye addeth this forecible exhortation.<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.1.</note> 
               <hi>I charge thee
<pb facs="tcp:26165:13"/>
therefore before God, and before the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which ſhall iudge the quicke and the deade at his appearing, and in his kingdome, preach the worde, be instant, in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, improoue, rebuke, exhort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2</hi> It is an argument &amp; token of the loue the Miniſter oweth vnto Chriſt and to the people, as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <hi>Ioh. 21.15.</hi> where Ieſus Chriſt ſayth to <hi>Peter</hi> after his reſurrection.<note place="margin">Iohn. 21.15.16.17.</note> 
               <hi>Simon ſonne of Iona, loueſt thou me more then theſe? He ſayde vnto him, yea Lorde, thou knoweſt that I loue thee: he ſayde to him, feed my Lambes.</hi> He ſaid vnto him the ſecond time. <hi>Simon the ſonne of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, loueſt thou me? He ſayde vnto him, yea Lorde, thou knoweſt that I loue thee: he ſayd vnto him feed my ſheepe.</hi> Chriſt ſaid to him the third time. <hi>Simon the ſonne of Iona, loueſt thou me? Peter was ſory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſayd to him the third time, loueſt thou me, &amp; ſaid vnto him, Lord thou kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt all thinges: thou knoweſt that I loue thee. Ieſus ſayd vnto him: feed my ſheepe.</hi> Whereby it is euident, that thoſe which feed not, loue not Chriſt: Sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:26165:14"/>
then that feeding or preaching is ſo plaine a token of the loue that the miniſter oweth to Chriſt, it is moſte neceſſarily required if any do preach and yet not vpon this loue, they haue their condemnation.</p>

They are called Paſtors and Sheepheards. They are called Huſbandmen, Guides, Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Meſſengers, beſides many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excellent titles giuen to them. Now how can they bee called Lightes, whiche haue no light in them, which either are in ignoraunce and darkneſſe themſelues, or els hide their ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dle vnder a Buſhel? How can they bee called the Salt of the earth, which cannot or will not ſeaſon the vnfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorie and ſinfull people, with the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; wholeſome doctrine of eternall life: How can they be called Paſtors and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, which do not feed or haue no foode
<pb facs="tcp:26165:18"/>
at all to giue to the flocke? How can they be called the Lords Huſbandmen, which haue no ſkill at all in tilling his ground, and ſowing his ſeede? How can they bee called Guides vnto other, whiche either know not the way themſelues, or els will not vouchſafe to open and declare it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: How can they be called Stewards, which haue no care of the houſhold, which either cannot or will not feede them? And how can they bee called the Lordes Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, whiche are not able to doe their meſſage, or haue no care at all to doe it.</p>
            <p>If the Miniſter bee a light to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of neceſſitie he muſt needes goe and ſhine before them in knowledge and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.

If he be a Guide, he muſt needes ſhewe the waye. If he bee a Stewarde, he muſt prouide for the houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde. If he bee a Meſſenger, he muſt bee willing and able to do his meſſage: Naie I ſaie more, it ſtandes for the Lordes glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and credite to haue ſuche Paſtors, and

ſuch Huſbandmen, ſuch Stewardes and Meſſengers, as haue wiſedome &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. The poore people of the Countrie will not hire him to be a Sheepheard to their Sheepe, whom they know to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and careleſſe, and ſhall the Lorde chooſe ſuch to gouerne &amp; guide his flock? The Gentleman and the Yeman wil not hire any to be ouerſeers of their Huſban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie, except they knowe them to haue ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient diſcretion and experience: and wil he thinke ye bee content with ſimple, foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and reckleſſe ouerſeers of his ſo dere and precious a Huſbandrie? The Noble man for his honors ſake, wil ſeeke to haue ſuch a one to be the Steward of his houſe, as is truſtie, wiſe, &amp; of ſufficient to guide and gouerne a whole houſholde, and ſhall the Lorde be leſſe carefull of his honour? ſhall he bee content with vnwiſe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull Stewardes? The Prince will haue a ſpeciall care to ſende ſuch to be his meſſengers and Ambaſſadors, as be moſt wiſe and faithfull, and are able diſcreetly and cunningly to doe their meſſage, and ſhall the Lordes meſſengers bee without knowledge? What can be more to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcredite
<pb facs="tcp:26165:19"/>
and diſhonour of his holy name? This argument I amplifie the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is very plaine &amp; effectuall. Mark I beſeech you wel, all theſe and other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes giuen to vs in the holie Scripture, doe require of euery miniſter of God that he preach the worde, as we haue a rare to aunſwere to our names, and a care of the glorie and credite of our God: euen ſo let vs be carefull in doing this ſo neceſſarie a duetie. What ſhall I ſaie more, the end and purpoſe of our calling and Miniſtrie requireth at our handes Preaching. The Lorde hath ordained Paſtors and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers for the gathering together of his Saincts, and to the edification of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Chriſt: Seeing then we are called to this ende, ſeing we are ordained to this purpoſe, there is no remedie, we that are the Miniſters of God, muſt needes of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie preach his worde. For a further proofe and concluſion of this matter, I call you to recorde, I appeale to your owne conſciences, which are now wonne to the Lord, which haue ſome meaſure of knowledge, which are called out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to light, from ignoraunce to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
<pb facs="tcp:26165:20"/>
ye that ſometime haue been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with reading Miniſters, and quarter Sermons, but now hunger and thirſt for the worde preached. I call you I ſaie, as witneſſes in this cauſe, what comfort you feele, what profite, what power in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall preaching of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word? How care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, how prophane, how ignorant, how leaude you were before, notwithſtanding the daylie and the ordinarie Readinges whiche diligently you had? What hath wrought in you that meaſure of faith, that heauenly knowledge whiche you now haue? What is it, that hath wrought in you ſuche a ſorrowe of your former life, ſuche a griefe and hatred of ſinne and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, both in your ſelues and others, ſuche an earneſt zeale of the worde, ſuch a conſcience and a care to reforme your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues and your houſholdes. What (I ſaie) hath wrought theſe thinges in you? How came you by them? What is it that hath ſo altered your mindes, deedes and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Let your conſcience be witneſſe to me in this matter: I am ſure you wil ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue that which I haue ſpoken, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the profite, the power and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie

            <p>All and euery one of theſe arguments doe proue and confirme as I thinke, that euery Miniſter neceſſarilye ought to preach, and otherwiſe, that he is no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter approued of God. All and euery one of theſe, or moſt of them doe quite ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw and condemne, all dumbe, idle and careleſſe Miniſters whatſoeuer. One day they ſhall knowe what accounte he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the ſoules of his people, for ſeeyng the worde of the Lord, in ſo many places, requireth in a Miniſter preachyng, yea, diligent and carefull preaching, in what a miſerable and damnable ſtate doe theſe men ſtand? The Apoſtle ſaieth woe be to me if I preach not the Goſpell. Well, it maie bee whatſoeuer I haue yet ſpoken will be graunted. It is neceſſarie that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Miniſter preache: but what ſhall all thoſe be condemned which haue not ſuch full meaſure of knowledge as other haue, whiche be not accounted and allowed for publique Prachers, God forbid? I know theſe difference in giftes, there was ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Apoſtles, but they all ſufici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently preached.

Let vs not take vppon vs to appointe him what he ſhould do. Seing he hath ſet downe prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, as the moſt excellent, and ordinary meanes to ſaluation, let not vs ſay that reading will ſerue the turne: ſeing that he requireth that his Miniſters bee apt to

pertakers of remiſſion of ſinnes through Ieſus Chriſte. Repentaunce is a true tournyng to GOD, a chaungyng of the outwarde and inwarde man, a dying to ſinne, a liuing to righteouſneſſe, and a mendement of the whole life: which this doctrine wee muſt beginne, this we muſt firſt of all and chiefly vrge: This is that doctrine chiefly and moſt of all preached by the holy Prophetes:<note place="margin">Ierem. 4.1. Ezec. 18.1.</note> This is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and vſuall voyce, <hi>O Iſraell returne to the Lorde.</hi>

This is an vſuall doctrine in all their Epiſtles. Now,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.7.</note> they can neuer truly repent which knowe not the greatneſſe of their ſinnes and the puniſhment due to them. And how ſhall they knowe this, except their ſinnes bee reproued and laied open by preaching the lawe of GOD, for by the lawe commeth the knowledge of ſinne:
<pb facs="tcp:26165:29"/>
ſo that the doctrine of the lawe muſt not bee ſeperated from the preaching of the Goſpell, for it is a Schoolemaiſter to bring vs to Chriſt. This then is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily required of euery Miniſter, freely and boldly to reprooue ſinne in all ſtates and degrees whatſoeuer. This is it that the Lorde ſaieth to his Prophete.<note place="margin">Iſai. 58.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And in deede there is no doctrine more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for this age, wherein wee liue, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though fewe can away it, but crie out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch as preache it. And as in other places, ſo in this place heretofore I haue had proofe in this matter. For vpon iuſt occaſion noting the certaintie of Gods iugements and condemnation of the wicked, I finde then that the impenitent and ſuche as continue in their ſinnes could not bee ſaued, God could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue them, here vpon ſome haue ſayd and
<pb facs="tcp:26165:30"/>
doe ſay ſtill of mee, that I preached, that God could not forgiue ſinnes. I ſayde, and I ſay agayne, the Lorde is as true in his iuſtice, as in his mercie. Chriſt ſaieth, except ye amend, ye ſhall all periſh: and againe, he that beleeueth not is damned. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth, no whoremonger, nor adulterer, no vnrighteous or vncleane perſone ſhall inherite the kingdome of Heauen. This is aſmuche as I ſaied, and in effect all that I ſaide, woe bee to me if I preache not the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>Now Repentaunce is a parte of the Goſpell, and that wee maie repent, it is needfull to knowe our ſinnes, and as the ſinnes of all men muſt bee reproued, and the iudgementes of GOD threatened againſt them, ſo eſpecially the ſinnes of publique perſones as Magiſtrates and Miniſters: And if this in no caſe will bee borne, but he that doth it, is ſtraight way blamed, alas, what ſhall wee doe? If wee ſpeake againſt the people, they are gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, they ſaie we deale hardly with them, but looke not to our ſelues or to the higher powers. If wee deale againſt
<pb facs="tcp:26165:30"/>
Gentlemen and greate men, wee are ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, euill ſpoken of and abuſed: If wee ſpeake againſt the ignoraunt and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Miniſters, they are alſo offended, and ſaye wee lacke diſcretion, charitie and modeſtie. Thus daungerous a thing it is to preache the Goſpell, yea euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them that glorie in the Goſpell, ſo that as our ſtate ſtandeth it mate bee ſaied cleane contrarie to the ſaying of the Apoſtle in this place: Woe to them that preache the Goſpell: and happie are they which preache not the Goſpell, and they are coumpted wiſeſt whiche either holde their peace, or els meddle not with this parte of the Goſpell. But the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſter how ſoeuer he ſeeme to be diſcouraged by ſuche wicked and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull dealinges of the worlde, yet he is to comforte himſelf in the Lorde, and to feare GOD more then men: It is farre better to diſcharge our dueties faithfully with a good conſcience, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though wee procure diſpleaſure of men, then by leauing our duetie vndone, or by doyng the Lordes worke negligently

            <p>The holie Apoſtle hath ſpoken it, woe bee to me it I preache not the Goſpell: And to aunſwere them ſomewhat which blame vs for dealing ſo hardly and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the ſinnes of the Miniſters. Is it not a parte of diſcretion to reproue their ſinnes whiche doe moſt hurte, and are the cauſes of many other ſinnes: this is that diſcretion whiche was vſed by the holy Prophetes euery where: They crie out againſt the negligence of the Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, againſt their ignoraunce, careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and leude conuerſation.

this modeſtie againſt himſelf, <hi>Woe be to me if I preach not the Goſpell:</hi> which woe ſignifieth no light, ſmall or eaſie matter, but greeuous curſe of GOD in this life, and that fearefull condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the life to come. Can they bee too ſharpely reprooued, or can any ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches bee too harde for them, whiche are ignoraunt and careleſſe in ſo greate a light of the Goſpell, after ſo long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, whiche ſhoulde bee guides to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whiche haue ſo many excellent meanes, ſo greate helpes of knowledge, offered to them by the Lorde, in theſe da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes whiche we liue in? Can they bee too muche or to often ſpoken againſt, which are ignoraunt, and will bee ignoraunt, whiche miſtike thoſe that reprooue them, whiche hate all that are not like themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, whiche ſeeke to deface the painefull Miniſter, yea, &amp; ſtande in defence of their owne wickedneſſe? Is not this to binde ſinne together with Cart-ropes? Sinne not twiſe, ſaieth the wiſe man, for one ſinne ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, &amp; therefore
<pb facs="tcp:26165:33"/>
take heede in tyme and amende, or els you periſh: Say what you will thinke what you will, the Lorde is my witneſſe I ſpeake the truthe. I knowe I might bee better thought of to paſſe euer ſuche matters, but woe bee to mee if I preache not the Goſpell. But it may bee yet that ſome will ſaye although this bee true that you haue ſpoken, yet all truthe is not to bee ſpoken at all times, in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to all perſones. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter muſt cut the word of GOD aright: like a wiſe Steward, he muſt giue meate in due ſeaſon. To theſe men I aunſwer, that no neceſſarie truthe is to bee hidden from the Churche of GOD. And to ſpeake more fully and directly to the purpoſe, as touchyng this matter of the neceſſitie of preachyng, of the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eſtate of them that be with out it, and of ſuche Miniſters as preathe not, this matter I ſay in my conſcience, with wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and diſcretion may be ſpoken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately or openly, where ſoeuer, when ſo euer, and before whom ſoeuer, there is no
<pb facs="tcp:26165:33"/>
place, but it hath need of this doctrin, no time but it requireth it, no perſons that it is not meet for. It is moſt fit and conuenient, moſt profitable and neceſſarye for all ſtates and degrees of men, high and low, rich and poore, ſtrong and weake, learned and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, Princes, Nobles, Biſhops, Preachers, dumbe Miniſters and people, all haue need of this doctrine. They which haue knowledge, haue need of it, that they may know what they haue beene, that they maye ſee what they are, &amp;c be thankfull to God. The ignorant ſort haue need of this doctrine, that they may feel their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable eſtate, and ſo ſeek for help and remedy. Princes, Nobles and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, haue neede of this doctrine, and it is fit and neceſſary to be preached before them, that knowing the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and worthines of preaching, they may be more carefull and liberall to maintaine it, and with better conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence beſtow their liuinges. The lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Biſhops haue neede of this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, it is chiefly to be vrged before
<pb facs="tcp:26165:34"/>
them, and they are continually to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it, leaſt they lay hands raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on any man, and ſo be partakers of other mens ſins. The wiſe and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Preachers haue neede of this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that they may be comforted and ſtirred vp to greater zeal and trauail: ignorant miniſters haue need of this doctrine, that they may ſee the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſtate they ſtande in, and ſo ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther amende if it will be, or els giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to ſome other calling, more fit and profitable for them. Let this doctrine be ſtayed: Let men be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, as they are of them ſelues that they are in good ſtate without the word preached, that bare reading wil ſerue the tourne, the people waxe careleſſe, and make no account of preaching. For they thinke they are wel inough, and beſt of al without it, the people of God ſhal lack their ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thening, their growing in faith and knowledge, Princes and Gentlemen wil make no account (as they do but little alreadie) how, or on whom they beſtow their liuinges. The preachers
<pb facs="tcp:26165:34"/>
ſhal be nothing ſet by, the Idol mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters encouraged: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> famous vniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties decated &amp; ouerthrown: &amp; in a word y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> concealing, hindring, &amp; withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding this doctrine, is the next way to caſt down al religion &amp; learning: to bring princes, nobles, rich &amp; poore, miniſters &amp; people, to hipocriſie and Atheiſme. The lord therfore open y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouthes of his faithful miniſters, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dayly vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of this ſo neceſſary a doctrine, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the prince may be ſtrengthened, the Nobles ſtirred vp, all good miniſters encouraged, the poore people inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ignoraunce &amp; idolatry defaced, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and knowledge of God, may flowe thorow the whol land, that at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> length, al ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; careles miniſters may be aſhamed, &amp; euery congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may haue a faithful, ſeuerall, &amp; a reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Paſtor. Thus we haue ſeene at large, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whoſoeuer wil preach y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel faithfully and profitably, he muſt firſt of all, &amp; chiefly, vrge the doctrine of repentaunce, which men can neuer haue, before they know their ſins by the law of God, and therefore the ſins
<pb facs="tcp:26165:35"/>
of all men muſte be throughly and ſharply reprooued, and chiefly the ſins of them which do moſt hurt, and giue greateſt occaſion of offence: as the ſin of the magiſtrate and the miniſter. Now indeed to repentance, ther muſt be ioyned alſo the doctrine of remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes through Chriſt. But this belongeth onely to them that repent, that are humbled and caſt down, that feele in their conſcience the torment of ſinne and condemnation, to ſuch belongeth remiſſion of ſinnes, to ſuch it is to be offered and preached, but it doth not appertaine to ignorant and ſenceleſſe men, to hipocrites, infidels, Atheiſtes, Iuſticiaries, prophane and carnall men, theſe haue nothing to do with the doctrine of remiſſion of ſins.</p>
            <p>And becauſe this age is altogether ſecure and careleſſe, ful of iniquitie, of ignorance, diſobedience, vnthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and contempt of the worde, it is vnworthie of the doctrine of mercie, and remiſſion of ſinnes, ſo much the more vnworthy, as the benefites of God in ſo great meaſure, and ſo long
<pb facs="tcp:26165:35"/>
a time haue beene receiued without any profit at all, ſo that in many ther is nothing ſtil, but ignorance and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, in others leſſe zeal and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, leſſe godlineſſe of life then was in them many yeares agoe: and are theſe men worthy of mercy? Is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins to be preached and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to them, nay the former doctrin of repentaunce, of the lawe of reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſinne, of denouncing the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God againſt all ſtates and degrees. This part of the Goſpell, I ſay is moſt fit and needful for ſuch an age. And <hi>woe be to vs, if we preach not the Gospell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider alſo, I beſech you here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we goe to an ende, the excellency and worthineſſe of the preaching of the goſpel. It is ſmal accounted of in the worlde, it is thought a vile and a ſimple office, it is contemned and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed of the moſt part: But if theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knew the ſweet and excellent things contained and offered in the Goſpell, which is the matter of preaching, they woulde alſo know the worthineſſe of
<pb facs="tcp:26165:36"/>
this ſo high a calling, &amp; that the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy therof may more clearly appeare, let vs adde ſome further proofe of this matter. And firſt remember, that this calling of the miniſtery &amp; preaching of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word, is no deuiſe of any mortall man, but the ordinance of the liuing God.<note place="margin">2. Peter. 1.</note> It was he y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ordayned <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; the prophetes. <hi>The propheſy came not in the old time by the will of man, but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men of God ſpake as they were mooued by the holy Ghoste.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark. 3.13.</note> The Lorde Ieſus himſelf, called, appointed, &amp; ſent foorth into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world his Apoſtles to preach y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpell:<note place="margin">Acts 20.</note> It is the holy ghoſt, which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth faythfull ouerſeers to feede the Church of God.<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.</note> It is Chriſte alſo at this day, which appointeth paſtors and teachers, for the gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his ſaints. It muſt needes be a worthy and an honourable calling, which hath ſo worthy authors, euen God him ſelf, his ſonne Chriſt Ieſus, &amp; the holy ghoſt: yea, and not only ſo, but as worthy haue exerciſed &amp; practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this calling. The firſt preacher y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euer was in the world was God him
<pb facs="tcp:26165:36"/>
ſelfe, he preached to <hi>Adam</hi> in paradiſe that comfortable Goſpel, the ſeed of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woman, ſhall deſtroy the Serpentes head. After that he ſtirred vp <hi>Noe,</hi> &amp; <hi>Lot, Moſes</hi> and the prophetes, men of ſingular credite and authoritie. Nay what ſhal I ſpeake of <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> of the which, the one was a moſt victorious prince, and the other moſt wealthy, &amp; yet they haue gotten more glory and credits, by their doctrines and inſtructions, then by all their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and triumphes. Theſe are gone and they are gone, but their good cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, their prouerbes, their Pſalmes, &amp; Preachings, remaine and abide for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer for their euerlaſting memory, to the glory of God, and dayly profite of his church. The firſt miniſter &amp; prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the new Teſtament, was <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, of whom Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour ſaith,<note place="margin">Mark. 2.</note> there was not a greater Prophet amongſt womens children. Nay Chriſt himſelfe was alſo a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the goſpel, &amp; witneſſeth that he came into the world euen to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. After him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles alſo were
<pb facs="tcp:26165:37"/>
ſent into the world, euen to this end. Seing then that God him ſelfe, &amp; his ſonne Chriſte Ieſus, haue vouchſafed to preach the word, ſeeing ſo famous men as the Prophetes and Apoſtles were ordayned to this purpoſe, it muſt needes followe that the office of preaching is moſte famous, worthy and excellent. The worthineſſe alſo of our calling moſt euidently appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the worthineſſe and price of the things committed vnto vs, which is the people of God, the Churche of Chriſt, his dear ſpouſe, the very price of his bloude: It ſo great thinges bee committed to vs. If the Lorde put vs in truſt with ſo deare and precious thinges, our calling muſt néedes bee worthy and notable. Remember the notable effect and fruite of this cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the winning of ſoules, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion and ſaluation of the faithful.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note> It pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſſe of preaching to ſaue them that beleeue. And further, the worthy matter of preaching, is both here and other where ſet downe, namely the goſpell,
<pb facs="tcp:26165:37"/>
the word of reconciliation, the worde of grace, the good newes and glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges of ſaluation, the teſtimony of Ieſus Chriſt, repentance and remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes. O that al men woulde conſider this, that the glory of Gods miniſtery might appeare. If Princes noble men, and Patrons, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this, they would haue more care &amp; conſcience in beſtowing their liuinges, and in defending the good miniſter. <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 47.23.</note> king of <hi>Egipt</hi> in the time of famine, had ſuch a care to pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uide for his idolatrous prieſts, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee would not ſuffer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſel their land, but gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ſufficient ordinary to liue vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This example of an idolater in prouiding for idolatrous prieſtes ſhal condemn many chriſtian gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which haue a great deal leſſe care for true &amp; Chriſtian miniſters, which are ſo farre from adding any thing of their owne to their maintainaunce, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> rather daily by deceite or violence, they take that from the Miniſter, which long agoe was giuen by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Let the papiſt, the Atheiſt and
<pb facs="tcp:26165:38"/>
hipocrite remember and conſider the worthy calling of the miniſter, that laying aſide all contempt, ſkoffing, diſdaine and railing, they mighte in heart, reuerence and honor the Lords ordinance, &amp; let al people remember this that they may chearfully yeelde honor obedience, reuerence and main<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tainance to the faithful miniſter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that his calling is of the Lorde, that he hath to deal with your ſoules, that his purpoſe is to win you to the Lord, that he preacheth no leſſe a thing then the holy goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt. Now theſe things righty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, is he not worthy to be obeied and maintained.<note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Howe beautifull are the feete of them, that bring the glad tidinges of peace</hi>: And reade al which is gone before in the chapter, that you may know that hee which preacheth the goſpel, by right and equity ought to liue of the Goſpel. Let al good Miniſters remember this for their comfort, and inſtruction, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the world thinke of them, they haue a worthye and highe calling,
<pb facs="tcp:26165:38"/>
and let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not faint, but make their miniſtery fully known, and end their courſe with ioy: and let al ignoraunt and careleſſe miniſters, eſpeciallye remember this doctrine, that ſo they may either amend, or elſe come to ſhame &amp; confuſion. If the Lord be the authour of the miniſtery, the ſoules of the people are committed to vs: If the effect of our calling be to ſaue the ſoules of the people: if wee haue to deal with the goſpell of Chriſte: If ſo famous &amp; notable men haue alwayes beene in this calling, what a man ought y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſter to be? what care? what conſcience? what knowledge? what zeale &amp; holy conuerſation is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at his handes? You may ſee &amp; witneſſe with me, I ſpeake nothing to the defacing and diſcredite of the miniſter of God, but rather to his great credite and glory: his calling is moſt worthy and honourable, hee is worthy of double honour, he is to bee obeied &amp; ſufficiently maintained, hee is the ſteward of the Lords houſe, and the meſſenger of the Lorde of hoſtes.
<pb facs="tcp:26165:39"/>
But as the faythfull miniſter is to haue his credit and commendation, ſo the ignorant and careleſſe ſort, as we haue ſufficiently already prooued, are to be caſt down &amp; defaced, becauſe by their ignoraunce, idlenes and lewde conuerſation, they greatly diſhonour the Lord, and deface his glory, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude and end with the holy Apoſtle: <hi>I beſeech you brethren, that you know them which labor among you, &amp; are ouer you in the Lord, and admoniſh you, that you haue them in ſingular loue for their worke ſake.</hi> By the which place, we ſee that ſuch as labor not, admoniſh not, and work not (ſuch I ſay) are not worthy of any loue or honor, but rather to be thruſt out and banniſhed, as vnprofitable me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of God. The which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord of the harueſt, graunt for his tender mercies, in Ieſus Chriſte. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
