         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 6.</note> the ſame ſtirred up St. <hi>Paul</hi>
to perſecute Chriſt before he had knowledge of him. Thus
was the Zeal of this Convert, which a Reverend Father
of the Proteſtant Church wrote to be reſerved for future
Memory.</p>
            <p>This Narrative I shall lay before <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and
<hi>Papiſt</hi> upon two accounts: Firſt, That all men may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the Danger of immoderate Zeal againſt thoſe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Judgment. Secondly, To shew how that Zeal and
Knowledge ought to walk together.</p>
            <p>1.<note place="margin">The Evil E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Zeal.</note> Immoderate Zeal, ſaith <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> was in his
time the cauſe of great Broyls and Troubles; inſomuch that
Truth it ſelf hath been ſtretched too far; ſo that by a

an Errour on the other,<note place="margin">

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:105397:3"/>
2.<note place="margin">Ovid lib. 2.</note> Zeal without knowledge may well be compared to
<hi>Phaeton</hi> in the Poet, who took upon him to drive the
Chariot of the Sun, but yet through his inconſiderate
Rashneſs ſet the world in a flame. St. <hi>Bernard</hi> hits full
on this point, in theſe words; <hi>Diſcretion without Zeal
is ſlow paced, and Zeal without Diſcretion is
ſtrong headed: let therefore Zeal ſpur on Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
and Diſcretion reign in Zeal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Zeal of this Convert, having joyned with the
knowledge of the holy Scriptures, became a lively Faith
in Chriſt, not chooſing Saint or Angel to plead his Cauſe,
but the beſt of Advocates <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> who is the only
Mediator between God and Man.</p>

                  <argument>

                        <hi>PHilip Corwine,</hi> Nephew unto <hi>Hugh Corwine</hi> late Archbishop of
<hi>Dublin,</hi> ſuppoſing our Predeceſſor <hi>John Long</hi> late Archbishop of
<hi>Armagh</hi> and Primate of all <hi>Ireland</hi> had been then living, wrote
this Epiſtle following; which came to my hands, thinking it had
been to me directed, my Name being <hi>John,</hi> and his Succeſſor, within a
little time after the Expiration of our ſaid Predeceſſor, I opened it.</p>
                  </argument>

                     <salute>Reverend and Worthy Father,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>AFter my long and tedious Travels, wandring like a <hi>Jew</hi>
finding no ſettlement, (ever ſince the Reformation of
the Church of <hi>England</hi> revived, and was appointed to be
obſerved by our Gracious Soveraign the Queen and Her
High Court of Parliament) I departed from <hi>Ireland</hi> into
<hi>England,</hi> from thence into <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſo into <hi>Italy;</hi> being
ambitious to viſit <hi>Rome,</hi> purpoſely to behold her Modes and
Forms: but being not ſatisfied with the Paſſages and cruel
Objects which I there beheld, I returned into <hi>Spain,</hi> and
took up my Lodging in St. <hi>Francis</hi> his Monaſtry in the City
of <hi>Sevill,</hi> where I have hitherto remained, expecting your
Gracious acceptance, and encouraging of a Prodigal Son to
come home to the Church of Chriſt: For were it no other
then the Tyranny of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, and the large In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences
which ſhe hath ſent abroad into moſt Nations,
for to maſſacre thoſe whom ſhe eſteems Heretical, purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to advance her Coffers, and to raiſe up her luxurious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105397:4"/>
it would be, for a rational man, a ſufficient preſident
to lay before him what an Idol, or rather what a devouring
Dragon, he and his Anceſtors have hitherto worſhiped.</p>
                  <p>I acknowledge I have feared this Monſter beyond my
Creator or Redeemer, and depended upon his ſinful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences
more than on the bitter Paſſions of my Saviour
Jeſus, for which I only crave mercy from above, whoſe Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is moſt infinite.</p>
                  <p>Alſo I have from my youth upward wandred in the paths
of Idolatry, worſhiping of Stocks and Stones framed into
humane ſhapes by the Art of Man, whoſe Eyes behold
neither my Bowing or my Kneeling, whoſe Ears heard not
my Petitions, nor their Mouths able to return me an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer:
therefore I cannot but lament, both for the precious
time which I have loſt, and for the Happineſs of which I
have all this while been bereaved, all thus juſtly happening
unto me through my perverſeneſs in not embracing thoſe
comfortable Offertures which my Gracious deceaſed Uncle,
<hi>Hugh</hi> late Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> propoſed unto me, in caſe
I had adhered unto the Proteſtant Faith, as it is now, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Apoſtolick manner, eſtabliſhed.</p>
                  <p>Yet knowing your Fatherly Clemency, and pious Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
by your former Correſpondence with my deceaſed
Uncle. I shall returne with the Prodigal Son, and come
over, if I may be ſo happy to receive your Encouragement,
and ſo end the reſidue of my days to Gods Glory and mine
own Salvation.</p>

with a blind zeal full of contention, propoſing to my ſelf how

the Slavery of the common ſort of thoſe parts, and what

of theſe her Dominions, and to the great Bleſſings of
God, that though he had for a while taken away the Truth,
yet he had permitted the ancient Laws and Liberties to Rule

that he intended to have reſtored theſe Nations again to the

               </note> I then recollected the Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Primitive Fathers and Chriſtians under the
Heathen Emperor, and ſaid within my ſelf, O Chriſt thou

This melancholineſs encreaſing more every day then other,<note place="margin">How the Convert thought to divert him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and was prickt in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note>
and ſtill running in my mind, to divert my ſelf, I took St.

mine eyes beheld this very Text of Scripture, which I here
choſe for my Recantation. So whereas <hi>Paul</hi> was Converted
by the voice ſaying unto him, <hi>(Why perſecuteſt thou me,</hi> &amp;c.)
Even after the ſame manner was I to the Truth recalled;
miraculouſly lighting on the ſame words, though I heard not

O God the Avenger, ſhew thy ſelf clearly,</hi> &amp;c. Then
was I in greater trouble of mind then before, thinking as if
I had heard their voices crying up for vengeance; then I
ſaid, doubtleſs the Prophet here deſired Juſtice, complaining
of the Tyranny and Impiety of thoſe days: And how he
ſets forth the Providence of Almighty God, and the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Affliction, and that he is the Defender of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted;
which Pſalm coming ſo opportunely, I fell into a
worſe fit then before, ſo that I began to deſpair, having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſo long in her Tyrany, as
being one of her Members.</p>
            <p>Yet to divert my ſelf from theſe thoughts,<note place="margin">How the Convert re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to leave <hi>Rome,</hi> ſuppoſing thereby to divert him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but ſtill was troubled in mind.</note> I at laſt reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to leave <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo to turn back to the <hi>Franciſcan</hi>
Convent at <hi>Sevil.</hi> Coming thither, I had not long tarried,
when I heard a hideous Cry in the Street, and enquiring what
that Clamour might be, one replied, a Heretick is ſeized on
for ſpeaking of evil words: Then ſearching further into the
Cauſe, I found it out, which was thus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:105397:7"/>
A Man named <hi>Leopald Donſever,</hi>
               <note place="margin">How the <hi>Spanish Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> troubled this Convert.</note> an Innkeeper of that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

that the new Law there made, called the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> would

<hi>Hereticks;</hi> and therefore he could wiſh that the Church of

            <p>Theſe words this poor Man ſpake innocently, out of pity

theſe two <hi>Franciſcans</hi> turning the interpretation otherwiſe,
purpoſely for their own ends, to have their forfeitures given
to their Convent, making the ſenſe worſe; informed the reſt
of the Convent of what this innocent Man had ſpoken.
Immediately upon their relation of the words, they all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
that he had ſpoken Blaſphemy againſt the Powers of
the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> Thereupon they not only ſeized on
this poor wretch his perſon, but alſo upon what little ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
he had, being all in this World for to have maintained
his Wife and Children, who (by this Injuſtice) were in a
ſhort ſpace after forced to beg the Charity of others, having
before in an honeſt way laboured to get a livelihood for

By this ſaying of mine, I received a check in theſe
words: <hi>We believe you will be ſuch another.</hi> At which I
withdrew, and held my tongue.</p>

&amp;c.</hi> As alſo what afflictions poor Proteſtants endure when
by the <hi>Romish</hi> Clergy Orders ſeized on, and the Courage
the eight Perſons in <hi>Rome</hi> had upon their Deaths, being
brought to the Stake of Perſecution, which I compared with
the Pſalm aforeſaid, being terrified that I had perſiſted ſo
long in the <hi>Romish</hi> Bloody paths, and had not returned
ſooner to the Faith of Chriſt as now I am in.</p>
            <p>Then being in a manner totally in deſpair of ever recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

to fix mine eyes, there to contemplate and lay hold on
the Living God. Then as if it had been with his Finger
pointing out a way for Salvation, I caſt mine eyes on theſe
Words in the Prophecy of <hi>Ezekiel.</hi>

            <p>Upon reading of this ſaying of the Prophet my Soul was
immediately changed;<note place="margin">How he was altered, and gave God thanks for his deliverance.</note> ſo alſo was my Reaſon and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
that I fell into a paſſion of weeping, which was a

for the multitude of my Sins. But they leaving me to
my ſelf, not conſidering how it was becauſe I had ſo long

a Devouring Dragon more than my Creator or Redeemer,
in obſerving of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Laws more than the Commands
of the living God, or the Precepts of Chriſt and his Apoſtles,
I immediately gave my Saviour thanks that he had opened
my Mouth to ſpeak the Truth, and theſe two Fryers not

            <p>During the remainder of my ſtay within the Convent
from that inſtant,<note place="margin">How he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed his Converſion.</note> I carryed my ſelf warily, leaſt I ſhould

            <p>Beloved Brethren,<note place="margin">Thus he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes with this Rapture.</note> In this Mercy of God I ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude

            <p>Therefore the Lord of his mercy grant <hi>me a broken and a

good and glorious Convert, who during his life, after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation,
made great progreſs in the converſion of others,
and that not in vain, having converted the Mayor of <hi>Drog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heda</hi>
his Wife, and ſeveral others in the Town before his
death. I dare not ſay that he was poyſoned, but there was
much ſuſpition as if the Fryers had done ſomething to him;
for he was ever and anon arguing with them in Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
