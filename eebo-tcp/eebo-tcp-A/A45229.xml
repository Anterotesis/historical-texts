            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IT'S evident in many places, eſpecially in the fenny Country, that by draining the fens, that Bogy Lands, not worth <hi>2s</hi> an Acre, has been improved to 5 or 6 Pound by Corning, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blith,</hi> in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Book of Husbandry, ſays that if you Plant Boggy Lands, with Willow and Sallow, and ſuch like Aquaticks, draining it firſt well and deep, it will be worth 5 Pound an Acre tho' before it was not worth <hi>2s</hi> an Acre, and in 11 or 12 Years, the Wood on that Land may be worth 60 Pound an Acre. Alſo in <hi>Kent</hi> they have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Ground not worth <hi>6s</hi> an Acre, to ſix Pound by Planting in their Hedge Rows, Fruit Trees, about 16 17 or 20 yards diſtant, the more Room the better, from one another, and one ſort of Fruit or other will proſper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on any Ground, and if you plant 160 Trees, of the beſt Pip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins and Red-ſtreaks on an Acre, it may reaſonably be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that one with another, they will yeild 320 Buſhels, and 20 Buſhels of Apples uſually makes a Hogſhead, ſo that there will be 16 Hogſheads on an Acre, and theſe will make 8 Hogſheads of Royal Cyder, which at <hi>2d per</hi> Quart, is 2 pound an Hogſhead, ſo that the 8 Hogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads will yeild 16 Pounds. But this Cyder Royal may be worth <hi>9d per</hi> Quart, and then an Acre will amount to near 40 Pound <hi>per</hi> Acre, and the Graſs will grow the between your Trees, or Gooſeberry, or Currants may be Planted betwixt, which is beſt, for the Graſs is apt to be ſour and bitter, and by this method you may Probably make 8 Pound <hi>per</hi> Acre more, ſo that in the whole by a modeſt computation 50 Pound <hi>per</hi> Acre may be made, but ſome affirms that above 140 Pound an Acre may well amount to in a Year, but however the Product, no Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

will be very great. Now to make Cyder equal to <hi>Canary,</hi> to a Bottle of Cyder, Botled in <hi>March,</hi> put two ſpoonfuls of the Spirit of Clary, ſold at the Apothecarys, and will be about a penny charge, and if you put a little lump of Loaf Sugar, and a ſpoonful of Brandy, and let it ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Week, it will make Cyder reſemble <hi>Canary,</hi> ſo near, that a well exerciſed Pallet, ſhall not know the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference: A Planter Writes that if in <hi>March</hi> you put a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of Spirit of Clary to your Cyder, it will equal <hi>Canary,</hi> without any more a doe, but you may ſtrenghten it with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Spirit of Brandy and Clary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſweeten it, and put in your Ingredients more or leſs as you think fit, this Spirit is a ſtrong Spirit but very wholeſome, and has the perfect flavour of <hi>Canary,</hi> ſee more of this by and by, and Read a Book Call'd the way to get Wealth, by making 23 ſorts of Wine equal to <hi>French,</hi> and alſo to make divers other Liquor, and other Curious Matters; and alſo remember that theſe Engliſh Liquors are more wholeſome for the Body than French. <hi>&amp;c,</hi> Every Nation affording that which is moſt proper for it's Natives, and the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that would accrue to the Nation, by Promoting our own Liquor, may be ſuppoſed near a Million a Year, that is ſpent in Poreign Liquor.

               <p>To improve paſture if it lye Low and wet, whereby it Chills the Roots, and produces Weeds, &amp;c. Caſt on it Hogs Dung, Horſe Dung and the Dung of any Fowls, mingled with Slack'd Lime, or Lime Stones, which being well ſoaked, Plough up the Land, turning down the Green Soard, yet raiſe the Ridges of the Land but a little ſloping, and ſo run a Trench Croſs-ways very deep, or as you ſee it otherwiſe convenient, and lay it Fallow; by this means it will be much dryer, and the next Graſs young, ſweet and tender.</p>
               <p>If your Ground be a Burning Sand, then Oſie it over (as before directed) and if it is troubled with Ant-hills, open them to the bottom, or rather lower, and the wet will drive them away, and if you Scatter Slacked Lime or burnt Pitch and Brimſtone on them, and it will kill them.

               <p>IN Planting obſerve when you remove any Tree to mark it in the Rind, that you ſet it the ſame way it grew firſt, bring with you as much of the natural Earth as you can, and over and above, adding a ſmall matter of Dung and freſh Mold, cuting off part of the top Branches, that they may not draw away too much Sap before its well Rooted.</p>

               <p>Secondly there are ſome who bore a hole a ſloap into the heart of the Tree, and ſo put the Scion in.

                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:49030:6"/>2. Be not too ſparing of Seed, for the more you Sow the thicker it will grow.</item>
                  <item>3. Expect but ſeven Years Crop, and then Plow it up, or Sow it again with the ſame Seed or other Grain.</item>
                  <item>4. Let not Sheep or other Cattle bite them the Firſt Year.</item>
                  <item>5. Your beſt way is to make your Ground Fine, as when you Sow Barly, and Harrow it even, and then to Plow theſe Seeds in alone, without any other Grain, as Gardners do Peaſe, but not at ſo great a diſtance; but make your Range about a Foot diſtance one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and they'l ſee it Flouriſh like Green Peaſe, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if you draw the Plow through them once or twice that Summer, to deſtroy Weeds and Graſs; and if you do thus great Clover and other Seeds, may be mow'd twice the firſt Year. There is another ſort at <hi>Paris,</hi> called <hi>La Lucern,</hi> which is not inferior to St. Foin, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther better for dry barren Land, and is to be managed as St. Foin. Thus you may improve barren Ground of 2 or <hi>3s.</hi> an Acre, to forty or fifty Shillings an Acre.

               <p>AN Ingenious Author ſays, That we may Brew as good Liquor at <hi>London</hi> as either <hi>York</hi> or <hi>Nottingham</hi> affords, and that our Derby Malt, Water and Hops, is as good as theirs, and that the difference lies only in the Brewing and well Ordering it. 1. He adviſes to put to one Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Malt 75 Gallons of Liquor, or River-Water, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it Boil for one Hour, and ſo proportionably for a greater or leſſer quantity, and to every Quarter of Malt half a Pound of Hops; your Malt being ready in the Meſh-tub, pour ſo much Water on it as will wet it quite thro', inſomuch that the Meſh may be rais'd in the Tun a conſiderable hight; then cover it up with Cloth very cloſe two Hours, preſerving the remaining part of the Liquor very hot in the Coopper, if not Boiling. Next the two Hours being expired, work your Meſh with proper
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49030:10"/>
Inſtruments very well, till you can diſcern no dry Malt in the Meſh; this done let your Meſh Tun run gently into a convenient Veſſel, and when you have let it run about half an Hour, according to the largneſs of the Meſh, put on the remaining part with a Pail, throwing it all over the Meſh by degrees. <hi>3dly.</hi> Your Worts being all gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and emptied from the Veſſel wherein you have gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, into the Copper, and the Hops put therein, boil it three Hours at leaſt, then empty your Copper into the back Cooller. <hi>4thly.</hi> While your Worts are Milk-warm, clear it in your guile Tun, while it runs clear from dregs; you may put your dregs into a Flannel Bag, and drain a quantity off clear, and of the Strongeſt Liquor from them. <hi>5thly.</hi> To your Worts 54 Gallons from a quarter of Malt, put two Quarts of good Yeaſt, and let it work 24 Hours beating it in three or four times a day, according to the Seaſon; Winter requiring great Care. The Guile being well wrought, Tun it up into well Seaſoned Veſſels, leaving li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for it to Work for about half a Day, then bung it up ſo cloſe. Let your Cask ſtand undiſturbed 6 or 10 Weeks, and it will be Fine and Strong. He ſays that if by accident it does not Work, a Remedy is; Take the Whites of two Eggs, and half a quartern of Brandy <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beat them well together, and pour them into the Guile <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the Drink is in the Cask, pour it into the Bung, and lay a warm Cloth over it, and in an Hours time it will work briskly. Remember you under-lay you Cloth that you cover your Veſſel with, that it may have room to begin to work, then take off the Cloth. Another way, take a quarter of an Ounce of Zinziber Pouder, 2 Ounces of fine Loaf Sugar, mix them well with ſome of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor being warm, and pour it in.

               <head>To make Cyder equal to <hi>Canary</hi> and very cheap.</head>
               <p>CYder, of which Red Streak is beſt, is a good Stomach Liquor, purifies the Blood, is Diuretick, and roots out the Scurvy. To make Cyder as good as <hi>Canary,</hi> you muſt make Sweets thus. Take 112 Pound of Sugar, Water 8 or 10 Gallons, in which 30 or 40 Eggs are well beaten and diſſolved; put your Sugar into your Kettle or Veſſel on a gentle Fire, and put to it 4 Gallons of the Egg Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſtir all about till the Sugar is diſſolved, when it boils put in more Egg-water, to keep it from boiling too high; and thus continue putting one Quart of another for about an Hour, till your Egg-water is ſpent. But if you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare your Egg-water in Parcels, to wit 4 Pints at a time, its the beſt way, ſo will the Eggs carry away all the foulneſs of the Sugar, making it riſe in a Scum, and then take it clear; thus having done, boil it to the conſiſtency of a Syrup, which will be clear and pure and cold, is to be put into your Cyder with a little Coriander ſeed bruis'd and tied in a Rag, and this Syrup I call ſweet. Obſerve that you may make them of Brown or White Sugar, the White makes your Cyder a pale Colour, and the Brown of an Amber Colour; the latter may do as well, and this will not ſtand in <hi>6d</hi> a Quart; put in of this ſweet two or three Gallons, more or leſs as you pleaſe, but let your Cyder be rack'd the laſt time, and paſt the fermentation before you put it in; thus mix your ſweets and the Spirits you intend to put in together, with a little quantity of Cyder, ſtir them well together, and put all into the Hogſhead of Cyder, ſtirring them all together 7 or 8 Minutes with all your ſtrength, with a ſtrong Staff at the Bung-hole, then ſtop it cloſe, and draw none off till three, or four or five Months, and then its fit to Drink. In making it reſemble <hi>Canary,</hi> you muſt uſe more ſweets and Spirits; if you put in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits before Permentation, they will evaporate and be loſt. That your Cyder thus mixt with ſweets and Spirits, may ever drink well, it muſt firſt be put up into Wooden Casks, and then kept its due time to incorporate as aforeſaid; you may firſt make tryal of a Veſſel of ſeven Gallons, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in three Quarts of Spirits, and two Quarts of ſweets; and after Twelve Weeks it will be as ſtrong and Pleaſant as <hi>Candry,</hi> and then you may Bottle it up. This Liquor will keep in a Cask three Years, if you keep the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49030:11"/>
Cask full, but obſerve that in eight Weeks time, the Liquor will waſte about two Pints, which be ſure fill up again with Liquor of the ſame ſtrength, or ſtronger; and thus it will grow better and better. If you chance to keep it too long, and it becomes unpleaſant as old Hock, then take one Hogſhead of your ſtale Cyder, and one of Tart New Cyder, before it is quite fine, and mixing them well together. Tunn them up in two other Hogſheads, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the proportion of Spirits and ſweets to the quantity of new Cyder, and then it will be as good as ever it was and ſpeedily fit to drink<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wormwood Cyder. To make this, you do by adding Wormwood to Cyder Royal, as you do to Wines; and this is Excellent to procure Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, and cauſe Digeſtion.</p>
               <p>If you would make Cyder-Royal as ſtrong as <hi>French</hi> Wine, take a Hogſhead of Cyder, and add ſome part of another Hogſhead to it, and Diſtil off the Spirit; this Spirit rectifie a ſecond time, and then put into the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the Hogſhead of Cyder, fill up the Hogſhead with other freſh Cyder; ſtir it about well, and keep it cloſe ſtopt, except one Day in 9, 10, or 20, you let it lie open 5 Hours, and thus in three Months its fit to drink<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and will be as ſtrong as <hi>French</hi> Wine.

That Cyder of the ſtrength of French Wine, requires to every Hogſhead of Cyder 4 Gallons of Spirits, or Cyder Brandy, which is not a Pint of Spirits to four Quarts of Cyder, 2. The ſecond Cyder of the ſtrength of Canary, requires of Spirits 6 Gallons, or Cyder Brandy, to every Hogſhead, that makes about a Pint and a half of Spirits to a Gallon of Cyder, and about three quarters of a Pint of ſweets to the like quantity.</p>
               <p>The Spirit of Cyder is Extracted by Diſtillation, in a Copper Veſica, Tinn'd within, with its Worm, from Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in all reſpects, as they make <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p>I am apt to think, that if you put two Spoonfuls of this ſweet, made as aforeſaid; and one Spoonful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Spirit of Clary, and a ſpoonful of Spirit of Cyder into a Pottle, it will be very Rich in a Months time, and will not ſtand in above <hi>6d</hi> or <hi>7d</hi> a Bottle. Try Experiments, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting more or leſs, till you pleaſe your Palate. I conceive with Syrup of Clove-gillyflowers or Spirit of it, or any wholeſome Spirit or Syrup, you may make what taſted
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49030:12"/>
Wine you pleaſe. By this Method, Perry, Cherries Currans, Gooſeberry Wine, may be made to reſemble Canary, and as good and wholeſome. Doctor <hi>Hartman</hi> ſays he has obſerved that Brandy, Spirit of Wine or Grain, and other Spirits, if they are Fine may do; and that he has experienced, that the Spirit of Moloſſes, Raiſons, and the Lees of good Wine, with other Fruits if rectifi'd and drawn fine, are as good; and that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified Spirit of Malt will ſerve where Spirit of Cyder is not to be had. He ſays that the firſt he compleated was, thus, He put ſix Gallons into a Veſſel, two Quarts of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rups or ſweets, and three Quarts of the Spirit of Cyder, which after two or three Months he found to be as ſtrong and Pleaſing as Canary. He ſays further, that twenty eighth Pound of Sugar will make four Gallons of ſweets, and ſo proportionably, and the Whites of 8 or 10 Eggs well ſtirr'd and put in as before directed.</p>

               <figure/>
               <p>TO be a Compleat Angler obſerve theſe things fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p>1. His Cloaths ought to be of a dark Colour.</p>
               <p>2. Let your Angling Rod be light and taper, and the top prety ſtiff, and about 4 yards long.</p>
               <p>3. The beſt time to provide Fiſhing Rods, is from the 11th of <hi>December</hi> to the middle of <hi>January,</hi> being then freeſt from Sap, Haſle, Black Thorn, Crab-Tree and Yew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwitches are moſtly uſed. Let your Stocks and Tops be taper and ſmooth, and each joint neatly ſuited, bind them together 16 Months with ſtraight poles among them, that they may not wrap. If you uſe a Firr Angle rub it with <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> and it gives a curious Cheſnut Colour.</p>
               <p>Proportion your Rods and Lines according as the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Ponds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are in largeneſs; your Lines alſo muſt be in ſtrength proportionable to the Fiſh you expect to catch; For the colour of the Hair, if there be any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, I prefer a pale water Green, which you may dye thus; Take a Bottle of Allom-water, a good handful of Marygolds, boil them till a yellow Scum ariſes, then put half a pound of green Copperas, and half a pound of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digreaſe, and beat them to powder, put theſe into the Allom-water, then put in the Hair, ſet them to cool 12 Hours, then take out the Hair and let it dry.</p>
               <p>Let your Line for the Artificial Fly be ſtronger than the Ground Line for the Trout.</p>
               <p>5. Your Shot ought to be faſtned about a foot from the Hook. Your Float, if a Quill, make thus, Take two ſoft Gooſe Quills, cut the Heads of each, about an Inch
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49030:16"/>
and a half, then ſhut them together like a Pin caſe, faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with melted Shoomakers Wax, put a Pill of the ſame Wax within the end, to keep out Water, with 2 Caps or Rings made of Quill, to ſlip on each end of the Float, for the Line to go between; ſome uſe a Cork cut like a Pear, and bored thro' with a ſmall hot Iron, then put in a Quill of a fit Proportion, then on a Grindſtone rub it ſmooth.</p>
               <p>6, In the next Place be provided with a Plummet to try the Depth of the Water.</p>
               <p>7. Have Bags of Linnen and Woolen for all ſorts of Baits, and a little Wherſtone to ſharpen your Hook and alſo be provided with a Landing Net, and a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knife, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All your Tackling in Order, go to the River, and find a Place, if you can, that hath a gravelly or ſmooth Bottom, and about 2 or 3 yards in depth, the Stream not too ſwift, then about a yard from the place you deſign to Fiſh at, caſt in a quarter of a Peck of Grains, or as many more if you pleaſe, dip them firſt in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that they may ſink the better, and about an Hour after you may begin to Fiſh; for by that time its proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Fiſh may have found them. If you have not Sport in an Hour, you may conclude there is none, or elſe that Pearch and Pike are there, that live on ſmall Fiſh.</p>
               <p>8. Then plumb the Ground, and Fiſh about 2 Inches from the Bottom; the beſt Summer Bait, except in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> their Spawning time, when they are not gone, ſhould be large Wheat, ordered as Furmety, which may be kept 15 or 20 days in Water or Beer, putting in freſh as the Skins grows upon it, if you keep it in Water, when you put any in a Box for preſent Angling, put Wort, or Ale, or Beer, to it a while, or you may boyl good Grain, as Wheat, Malt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in Milk till it's ſoft, or in ſweet Wort which is full as good, and peel off the outward Rine, which is the Bran, and ſo uſe it; or if you pleaſe you may fry it in Milk and Honey, or ſteep it in ſtrong ſcented Oyls, as Spike, Amber, Ivy, Polipody, Aniſe, Turpentine, Oyl of Peter, Aſſa Faetida. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your Hook thus baited with a Corn, the point covered with a thin Rind, that you may ſee the White on one ſide, caſt in your Line above the Stream, near the ſide, the Float being upright, ſwimming down the Stream, when you ſee the Float ſink, ſtrike prety quick, according to the ſtrength of your Line; if the Fiſh is too large, make uſe of your landing Net, and after the catching 3 or 4 Fiſhes, caſt in a handful of Grains, and now and then lifting the Float above Water, and ſo you may catch many Fiſhes.</p>
               <p>For Ground Angling, uſe it only Evening and Morning, in hot Sun-ſhiny Weather; but if cloudy, at any time of the day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:49030:16"/>In Winter chooſe the middle of the Day, and where the Sun ſhines on your Pace warm, and bait with a little white tail'd Worm found in old rotten Thatch, when you Angle after a ſhower, endeavour to have the Wind on your Back, coming from South or Weſt, the Sun on your Face.</p>

               <p>Roach and Dace bite all Day long, but beſt at the Top.</p>
               <p>Gudgeon bites in <hi>April,</hi> and till he hath ſpaw'd in <hi>May,</hi> and generally all the Day long, in or near a gentle Stream; Angle for him in a gravelly bottom, ſtirring the Sand with a Pole or Rake, and they'll bite the better.</p>

               <p>Trout bites beſt in a muddy Water, in dark, cloudy, Windy Weather, from 8 till 10 in the Morning, and from 3 till 4 or 5 in the Afternoon; <hi>March, April, May</hi> and

               <p>Keep out of ſight when you Fiſh, and let the Sun be in your Face, or you'll have but little Sport, for if the Sun is on your Back, your Rod will with its Shadow fright them.</p>

Another way of Ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is called Trouling, which is moſtly for Pike; the baits are Roach, Gudgeon, Dace, Minow, Loach or Frog, put on the Wyer, that the Head being downwards, it may look as if it were playing in the Water, ſometimes manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it high, and then low, near the Place that Pike haunts, when he has taken it, give him Line, and he'll carry it to his Place of Abode, and there paunch it, then range abroad for more, and this you diſcerning by the Lines Motion, wind it up till the Slackneſs ceaſeth, then with a jerk hook him, obſerving this, as for all other Fiſh, that you do it contrary to the Motion of the Fiſh, and be ſure let your Tackle be ſtrong. To Angle for a Pike at the Snap, uſe a double Spring-hook, for he uſually holds the bait ſo faſt betwixt his Teeth, that it's hard to get it forth, or ſtrike him; then with a Spring-hook, the Wyer will draw thro' the bait and hook him if your hook be long; If he lie ſtill, or move ſlowly after he has taken the bait, and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find which way his Head lies, ſtrike directly upward and you will hardly miſs him.

Stubble till it is trodden very much, and then they repair to freſh Barley Stubble, and the Furrow among the Clots, long Graſs and Brambles, are ſometimes their lurking Places. For a Covey of twenty and upwards, in the Winter they ſit in dead Graſs in upland Meddows, or fog under Hedges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or under the Roots of Trees or among Mole Hills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Their haunts are various and uncertain, and tho' ſome by the Eye, by diſtinguiſhing the Colour from the Ground; and others by the Ear, by hearing the Cock call after the Hen, and the Hen's anſwering, and their chattering at joy at meeting; but to find Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge the beſt way, is as you do the Pheaſant, by the Pipe or Call and they will come near to you, and count their number and then to your Sport: You muſt ſurround your Covey, prepare your Nets, and prick a ſtick faſt in the Ground, and tie the one end to it, and then let your Net fall as you walk briskly round, without ſtopping, and cover the Partridge; then ruſh in and frighten them, and as they riſe they are taken.</p>
               <p>To take them with Bird-lime do thus, you muſt call firſt near to their haunts; if anſwered, ſtick your Lime Straws about a Croſs in rows at ſome diſtance from you; then call again, and as they come near to you they will be faſtened by your Straws, and ſo become your Prey. This way is uſed with great ſucceſs in Stubble Fields, from <hi>Auguſt</hi> to <hi>September,</hi> and in Wood. To take them with Rods, and in Paſtures, do as for the Pheaſant.

               <p>SIx or ſeven Labouring men, in light Ground it is uſual to have to follow the Plow, and that at ſome diſtance each with their Spades, taking ſome proportion to caſt up the Earth from the bottom of the Fourow, on that was turned over by the Plow. By this means an Acre of Ground may be Plow-trench'd in a day, as well as if it had been wholy done by the Hand; the Plow going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and turning in the Sword or Turf, and the Spades coming after and covering it with Earth that is light, makes it fit for divers ſorts of Tillage to be Planted in it,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49030:24"/>
this ſaves a great deal of the Charge of Trenching wholy by the Spade.</p>
               <p>But there is a Cheaper and eaſier way to Plow Trench Land, without the Spade at all, and that is, by making your Plow, that it may under cut the Earth, and caſt it over, inſtead of the, uſual way of Plowing, for the uſual way of Plowing, the Plow is made pointing and is forced under the Sword, and by the ſpreading of the Plow, and help of the turning board, you force the Earth from - ward which requires much more ſtrength, than if the Plow were made of a bredth proportionable, from the Shares point to it's hinder part, and the Sword or Earth caryed from the bottom, and a turning board caſt from - ward; and then you may either add a ſecond Colter, and ſhare to ſucceed the former (fixt to the very ſame beam) about 4 or 5 Inches lower, which ſaid ſecond Colter and ſhare will cut and take up another courſe in the bottom of the Trench, and carry it higher.</p>
               <p>And then the turning board will throw it on the firſt Plowing, or elſe you may make another to caſt higher then the firſt to follow it. Each of theſe Plows require but half the ſtrength of the common forcing Plow, for that it Cuts Raiſes, and caſts the Earth over without any ſide forcing at all.</p>
               <p>You may make this Plow 5, 6, or 7 Inches broad, or more according to the Nature of the Ground and ſtrength you deſign to uſe, whether 1, 2, or 3, Horſes to draw it and it will ſerve not only to Plow and Plow-Trench Land, but it will alſo ſerve to pare off the Turf of Ancient Paſture Land, in order to burn it, for the Foot on which the fore end of the Beam reſts, may be made to ſtand higher or lower as you pleaſe to have it; to the end it may cut thicker or thiner; and being as broad, will do that ſort of work as well as your breſt Plow, and with 6 fold; more ſpeed <hi>Worlidge</hi> ſays, he has made a model of it, that anſwers what is here propoſed, and had he an Ingenious Aſſiſtant ſhould ſoon bring it to perfection, but theſe hints he hopes may prove ſufficient.</p>
