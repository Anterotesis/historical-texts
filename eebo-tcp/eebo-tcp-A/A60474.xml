            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

than the mean or equal day, or ſuch a one as contains in length the juſt time of 24 hours;
from which Mean Day the Natural ones differing almoſt continually in length, this Table
ſhall ſtill give you the difference between them, and (by inſpection only) inform you what
quantity of time each natural day is either more than 24 hours long, or leſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> That upon each particular day, a Clock that is well adjuſted to a mean or 24 hour
day, ſhall then either gain or loſe juſt ſo much time, as that natural day is either longer
or ſhorter than the mean day:</p>
            <p>Therefore, if a Clock, having been firſt ſet right to the Sun the firſt day of any particular
Month, ſhall either gain or loſe in that whole Month ſo much in time as the whole ſum of Equations for that Month amounts to, (which you ſhall find noted down at the bottom of
every particular Column) then is it well adjuſted to the mean, Equal or 24 hour Day; but
if it have not either got or loſt ſo much as the whole ſum of Equations for the whole time it has
gone in do's amount to, then muſt its motion be regulated as occaſion requires, by skrewing
up the Bob to make it go faſter, in caſe it has not got enough; or elſe letting the Bob down lower
to make it go ſlower, in caſe it hath not loſt ſo much as the whole ſum of Equations do amount

            <p>THE Vibrations of a long
and weighty <hi>Pendulum,</hi>
although it be juſtly
eſteemed to be the moſt
exact and ſteady of all Natural Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
yet is it not capable of regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the <hi>Index</hi> of a Clock to ſuch a
pitch of Perfection, as continually to
point out the ſame time that ſhall be
given by the Sun on the Lines of an
exact and true Dial.</p>
            <p>The truth of which is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48793:4"/>
made evident by the moſt exact
and critical Experiments: For, let
all the moving parts, of a <hi>Pendulum</hi>
Clock, be contriv'd with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Skill and Judgment, and then
made up by the moſt cunning and
curious Hand, and after all this be
adjuſted by the utmoſt Care and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
of Man; yet ſhall not the
Motion of it correſpond ſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
with the Hours given by the
Sun, but that in ſome conſiderable
quantity of Time you ſhall be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of gain or loſs in the Motion
of it.</p>
            <p>The true Reaſon of which Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation
proceeds not from any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
that may be attributed to the
Motion of the <hi>Pendulum,</hi> (of whoſe
exactneſs we are by many curious
Experiments ſufficiently ſenſible;)
but rather from an Unequality le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48793:4"/>
and eaſie enough to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
in the diurnal Motions of
the Sun.</p>
            <p>Vulgarly, for the moſt part, the
Sun is indeed accounted to be the
Standard and Meaſure of all equal
Time, and Men generally eſteem
Natural Dayes to be all of one
length, as containing the juſt time
of 24 Hours; but upon a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
and curious Scrutiny, theſe vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Suppoſitions are found to be
falſe: For, neither is the Sun's Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
found to be exact, being in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
to us, ſometimes ſwift, and
at other times more ſlow; nor are
the Dayes themſelves, accounted
from Noon to Noon, of equal
lengths, ſome Dayes containing
more Time than ſome, and others
leſs; there being a natural neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that the unequal Motions of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48793:5"/>
Sun ſhould produce ſuch inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the lengths of thoſe natural
Days that are bounded by it.</p>
            <p>For a natural Day being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of that ſpace of Time, in
which any one Place or Point of
the Earth is moved in its diurnal
Motion Eaſt-ward, from the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
Sun of any one Day, to that
of the next; it will follow, that
theſe Dayes can never be equal, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
the Sun in that ſpace of Time
be ſo mov'd in her annual Orb, as
to cut out equal Diviſions on the
<hi>Aequinoctial</hi> upon the Meridian of
every Day; which Diviſions ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſected,
are by the Learned term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the <hi>Right Aſcenſions:</hi> For when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Right Aſcenſion either of
Sun or Star is mentioned, we are
to underſtand by it, thoſe Degrees
of the <hi>Aequinoctial</hi> that are interſect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48793:5"/>
by that Meridian, on which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sun or Star have then their
place.</p>
            <p>But that the Sun between each
Meridian does not move ſuch juſt
and certain Spaces in her own Orb,
as thus to interſect equal Diviſions
on the <hi>Aequi-nox,</hi> upon every Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian,
needs no other evidence than
what either Calculation it ſelf af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords,
or Globes by an occular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection
demonſtrate to us. By
Calculation, if an exact Table of
<hi>Right Aſcenſions</hi> be compoſed, for
the Meridian, or Noon-time of each
particular Day, there will be found
almoſt a continual difference in the
length of thoſe Interſections that are
made by the Sun on the <hi>Aequi-nox,</hi>
upon every Meridian; ſo that there

in the <hi>Right Aſcenſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
Which will be the more apparent,
if you make an Estimation of the
<hi>Right Aſcenſions</hi> of about 10 Dayes
together, and compare that with
thoſe of the ſame Number. The
like will appear plainly, if tryed on
the Globe; for if you mark out
on the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> any 10, or more
Day's Motion of the Sun, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his true place found out in an
exact <hi>Ephimeris,</hi> and paſſing theſe 10,
or more Days motion under the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian,
noting what Degrees on the
<hi>Aequmoctial</hi> are then traced out, which
compared with the Degrees traced
out, by making the ſame number of
Day's Motion in ſome other part of
the <hi>Ecliptick,</hi> to paſs the Meridian, and
the difference of <hi>Right Aſcenſions</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
between thoſe two equal
number of Dayes will plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:48793:6"/>
All which Irregularities, or differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in <hi>Right Aſcenſion,</hi> proceed from
two principal Cauſes: 1. From the
different Poſitions: And, 2. From the
<hi>different Centres</hi> of thoſe <hi>Orbs</hi> in which,
and according to which the Sun
and Earth do move; from whence
ariſes a natural neceſſity, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two ſuch regular and equal
Motions, whoſe Poſition is thus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,
thoſe appearing differences
ſhould ſtill ariſe; for though both
Sun and Earth, the one in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
the other in it's diurnal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions,
be rationally ſuppoſed to
be regular and equal in their own
Motions; yet in regard of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Poſitions of their Spheres, the
<hi>Right Aſcenſions</hi> that are made by
them cannot be equal; it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
that the Sun, when near
<hi>Aries</hi> and <hi>Libra,</hi> where he moves
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48793:7"/>
croſs the Equinoctial, ſhould then in
any particular number of days make
ſo great an alteration in <hi>Right Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion,</hi>
as he muſt do near the two
Tropicks, where both Equinoctial
and Ecliptick run paralel one to
the other; and accordingly by the
beſt Tables of <hi>Right Aſcenſion,</hi> 'tis
found that the <hi>Right Aſcenſions</hi> of
10 daies motion of the Sun near
the Tropick of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> ſhall ariſe
to above 11 degrees 30 minutes,
whereas that of the ſame number
of daies near the Equinoctial Point
of <hi>Aries</hi> ſhall ſcarcely amount to 9
degrees.</p>
            <p>Moreover, from the eccentrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of theſe Orbs, another irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
does happen in the <hi>Right
Aſcenſions,</hi> for the Centre of the
Earth, upon which it turns round
in it's daily Revolutions, being not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48793:7"/>
the ſame with the Centre of the
Suns Orb, it follows that the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Equinoxes pointed out by an
imaginary line drawn through the
centre of the Earth, and interſect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Ecliptick, ſhall divide that
Circle into two unequal parts; from
whence it ariſes, that the Sun muſt
ſpend more daies in paſſing through
one half of the Ecliptick, than he
does in paſſing through the other;
and accordingly by experience he
is found to move through that part
between <hi>Libra</hi> and <hi>Aries</hi> in 179
daies, but in paſſing between <hi>Aries</hi>
and <hi>Libra</hi> he takes up 186, which
is 7 dayes more; ſo that in that
part of the Year between <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
and <hi>March,</hi> he ſeems to us to
be ſwift in motion, but in the other
part between <hi>March</hi> and <hi>September</hi>
his apparent courſe is more ſlow;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48793:8"/>
which ſeeming ſwiftneſs and ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Suns motion, is the cauſe
that the <hi>Right Aſcenſions</hi> near both
the Tropicks are not alike, but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
much, as do alſo thoſe that are
nigh the Equinoxes: for the <hi>Right
Aſcenſion</hi> of 10 daies motion near
the Winter Tropick, is more by
60 Minutes, than that of the ſame
number of daies near that of the
Summer one; ſo alſo the <hi>Right
Aſcenſion</hi> of 10 daies time near
<hi>Libra,</hi> amounts to above 30 Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
more than thoſe of the ſame
number of daies near <hi>Aries</hi> does.</p>
            <p>Having thus plainly demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that natural daies muſt needs be
unequal, and laid down the Cauſes
from whence thoſe unequalities do
ſtill ariſe; I ſuppoſe it may now be
concluded to be extreamly unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
for thoſe that are ſo Nice
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48793:8"/>
and Curious as ſome are, to expect
an exact correſpondence between
the times given by the motions of
a Clock, and thoſe diviſions of it
that are made by theſe unſteady
motions of the Sun on the Lines of
a Dial; for if from the Reaſons
before laid down, there be in
nature a neceſſity for thoſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
of <hi>Right Aſcenſion</hi> before
aſſerted, and that the daies which
they bound, muſt differ alſo in
length, correſpondent to what thoſe
differences in <hi>Right Aſcenſion</hi> do
amount to; how then is it poſſible
that thoſe exact and regular moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a <hi>Pendulum,</hi> to what pitch
ſoever it be ſet, ſhould agree with
theſe motions of the Sun, and true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
divide thoſe daies that are not ſo
regular as it ſelf is: For,</p>
            <p>Suppoſe a Clock ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48793:9"/>
to the hour at a time when
natural daies are ſhorteſt, as about
the middle of <hi>March,</hi> this Clock
with the ſame pitch of motion,
ſhall in <hi>June</hi> or <hi>December</hi> finiſh it's
diurnal Revolutions ſooner than the
day ſhall do, by reaſon the natural
daies are now longer than thoſe of
<hi>March,</hi> to which the Clock had been
formerly adjuſted; and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
it ſhall now gain upon
every day, juſt ſo much time as
theſe daies in <hi>December</hi> are longer
than thoſe of <hi>March.</hi> So on the
contrary, if a Clock be adjuſted to
go true with the Sun in the Month
of <hi>December,</hi> at which time the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
day is alwayes longeſt, this
Clock when natural daies are ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
as in <hi>March</hi> or <hi>September,</hi> ſhall not
finiſh it's daily Revolutions ſo ſoon
as the day it ſelf ſhall be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48793:9"/>
and by conſequence go
each day ſo much too ſlow, as thoſe
daies of <hi>March</hi> or <hi>September</hi> are
more ſhort than them to which the
Clock before had been exactly
adjuſted.</p>
            <p>Since therefore there is no tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
exactneſs in thus adjuſting
Clocks to the Sun it ſelf, becauſe
being thus adjuſted at times when
daies are either ſhorteſt or longeſt,
their gaining or loſing will be the
more extream in the contrary parts
of the year: for Example; Clocks
adjuſted to the Sun in <hi>March</hi> ſhall
upon moſt daies in <hi>December</hi> gain
almoſt 50 Seconds, which in the
Months time ſhall amount to near
half an hour; and on the contrary,
if adjuſted to go true with the Sun
in <hi>December,</hi> it ſhall in <hi>March</hi> loſe
the ſame time, and ſo for any
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48793:10"/>
other, according as daies do differ
in length.</p>
            <p>That Clocks therefore may be
reduced to a more exact pitch of
motion, that their gain or loſs may
never be ſo extream, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to adjuſt them, ſo as that
their motion may be agreeable to
that of a middle day, or ſuch a one as
is a mean between natural daies that
are moſt long, and thoſe others
that are moſt ſhort; to which
pitch if a Clock be once adjuſted,
it's gain or loſs ſhall then be the
leſs ſenſible (for gain and loſe it
will ſtill) amounting in <hi>December</hi>
but to about 15 Minutes in the
whole Month, and in <hi>March</hi> to but
about 9, which is vaſtly more exact
than when it ſhall happen to be
adjuſted to the longeſt or ſhorteſt
of Natural daies, or to any other
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48793:10"/>
that is not equal to a mean or
middle day, of which there are but
few, which in the Table are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
by the Character ☉ <hi>Sol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to this exact pitch of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that may thus correſpond to a
mean day (the greateſt exactneſs
that a Pendulum is capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brought to) there is no way
certainly to adjuſt a Clock without
the help and aſſiſtance of a Table of
Equations, that give the daily diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
between a mean day and thoſe
which are either longer or ſhorter
than the mean day is; which Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
having formerly been compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Worthy and Ingenious
Mr. <hi>Chriſtian Hugens de Zulechim,</hi>
(who is reported to be the firſt
that ever applyed the Pendulum to
regulate the motion of a Clock)
and not long ſince Printed in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

bold, in regard of its exactneſs, to
tranſcribe in it's more natural form
of an Equation, by only expreſſing
the Equations themſelves, without

as Mr. <hi>Hugens</hi> has done

            <p>Now for their ſakes that deſire

ſuch a Table themſelves, that
thereby they may the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the nature of it; they may
Note, that the Equations are to be
found out, and a Table compoſed
in the manner following: Firſt find
out a mean <hi>Right Aſcenſion,</hi> by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
the 360 degrees of the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48793:11"/>
into 365 parts, and a quarter,
equal to the daies of a year, and the
product ſhall be the mean <hi>Right
Aſcenſion</hi> deſired, which will be
found to be about three Minutes
56 Seconds (according to Sir <hi>Jonas
Moors</hi> account of it in his Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Compendium) then by the
help of an exact <hi>Ephemerides</hi> (here
lyes the difficulty) let the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Right Aſcenſions</hi> of the Sun
be computed by Calculation, for
the Meridian Poſition of the Sun
for every day, to Minutes and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds;
which having done, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the daily differences of theſe
Natural <hi>Right Aſcenſions</hi> with the
mean one, by ſtill ſubſtracting
the leſſer from the greater; and
what remains ſhall be the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
deſired; ſtill noting down
either the exceſs or defect, that is,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48793:12"/>
whether the natural be more than
the mean or leſs: as for example;
Suppoſe the <hi>Right Aſcenſion</hi> between
the Meridians of the 1<hi rend="sup">st.</hi> and 2<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> of
<hi>January</hi> be found to amount to
4 Minutes, 20 Seconds, this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with the mean <hi>Right Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi>
3 Minutes, 56 Seconds, and
by ſubſtracting the leſſer from the
greater, the remainder will be
found to be 24 Seconds, and ſo
much the Natural <hi>Right Aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
does then exceed the mean
one; this 24 Seconds is the Equati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for that day, it being from
noon to noon 24 Seconds longer
than a mean day is; and ſhews you,
that a Clock when well adjuſted
to a mean day, ſhall then gain
24 Seconds, becauſe it finiſhes it's
Diurnal Revolutions ſooner by 24
Seconds than the day it ſelf does:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48793:12"/>
on the contrary, when the <hi>Right
Aſcenſions</hi> of Natural daies are leſs
than the mean ones, as they are
about the middle of <hi>March,</hi> by
almoſt 20 Seconds, this 20 Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds
being the Equations belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſuch a day, ſhall ſhew
you, that upon ſuch a like day a
well adjuſted Clock ſhall then
loſe 20 Seconds; for the mean
day to which it is adjuſted being
longer than the natural one by
20 Seconds, the Natural Day ſhall
be finiſhed ſooner by 20 Seconds
than the Clock at that time ſhall
accompliſh it's diurnal or daily
Revolutions, and by conſequence
it ſhall then loſe 20 Seconds.
The Equations thus found for
every particular day, and a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
compoſed of them, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
that which is here inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48793:13"/>
whoſe Uſe we now come to
ſhew more particular in ſome
Caſes.</p>
            <p>For Explanation, take notice,
that the firſt Column contains the
daies common to every Month, the
other 12 Columns that belong to
the ſeveral Months themſelves, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
thoſe Seconds of time that all
natural daies are either longer or
ſhorter than the mean day. Note,
that in four parts of the Table are
placed this Character ☉, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes
the times wherein natural
daies having before been longer
than the mean day, do then begin
to be ſhorter; or having before been
ſhorter, do then begin to grow
more long: Note alſo, that thoſe
daies upon which this Character ☉
is affixed, have no Equation, they
being equal in their length to the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48793:13"/>
mean day; as for the words inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
among the Columns, they are
at ſight to inform you, that the
Equations in thoſe parts of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
are either more or elſe leſs
than the mean day, as the words
themſelves do fully expreſs; they
alſo note, that where the Equations
are more, there Clocks ſhall gain
each day ſo much as the Equation
belonging to it does then expreſs;
but if the Equations are leſs, they
then ſhall loſe; and how much
this gain or loſs for every particular
Months time ſhall amount to, is by
continual addition of the Equations
belonging to each day ſummed up,
and the quantity of time it amounts
to, ſet down apart at the bottom of
every Column.</p>
            <p>Note alſo, that ſince Clocks do
either gain or loſe, during the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48793:14"/>
whole number of daies included
between thoſe daies on whom this
Character ☉ is affixed, the whole
quantity of time either got or loſt
does amount to the ſumms that
follow, <hi>viz.</hi> Between the <hi>1ſt</hi> of
<hi>February</hi> and the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> the
time that a well adjuſted Clock
ſhall loſe, amounts by continual add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Equations together, to about
19 Minutes, 29 Seconds; between
this <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> and the <hi>15th</hi> of
<hi>July</hi> it ſhall gain about 9 Minutes
43 Seconds; from the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>July</hi>
to the <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> it ſhall loſe
22 Minutes 9 Seconds; from the
<hi>23d</hi> of <hi>October</hi> to the laſt of <hi>Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
it ſhall gain 31 Minutes 55 Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds:
All this is to be underſtood
of a well adjuſted Clock, ſet right
to the Sun at the beginning of each
time of either gaining or loſing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:48793:14"/>
By this Table, if you would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
a Clock to a mean time, which
is the greateſt exactneſs to which
it's poſſible to be brought, do thus:
Firſt ſet it true to the Sun, and
note the day, then let it's motion
be continued without ſetting a new,
for about 30 or more daies: Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
then the time that it has got
or loſt by the Sun, then ſumm up
the whole number of Seconds inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the Table, between thoſe two
daies of firſt ſetting and laſt Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
(allowing 60 Seconds to a
Minute) and if the gain or loſs of
your Clock be equal to the ſumm
of time that it ſhould have gained
or loſt by the Table, then is it well
adjuſted; but if it have not, then
muſt its motion be reduced to a
more near agreement, by ſhortning
the Pendulum in caſe the Clock
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48793:15"/>
have gone too ſlow, or letting the
Bob down longer in caſe it have
gone too faſt: Then ſet it anew, and
try it for about 30 daies more, and
then comparing its loſs or gain with
the ſumm of thoſe Equations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Table, as before you
did, let the Bob be again rectified
as the nature of it's motion requires;
and continue to do thus, till you
find its gain or loſs exactly to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond
with the ſumm of time
given by the Equations contained
in the Table, for the time that the
Clock has gone.</p>
            <p>When it is thus well adjuſted to
a mean time, it will be ſo exact,
as that, being ſet right at any time
of the Year, and ſo let go the whole
Year about, it ſhall come right with
the ſame Dial by which it was ſet
the ſame day Twelve-month; but
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48793:15"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n all other parts of the Year it ſhall
ſtill differ from the ſame Dial. For
Example: If ſet right the firſt of
<hi>February,</hi> and ſo continued in Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the whole Year about, it ſhall
continually be too ſlow the whole
Year, either more or leſs, till the
ſame day on which it was ſet: The
reaſon of this is plain enough; for
from the firſt of <hi>February</hi> to the <hi>4th</hi>
of <hi>May,</hi> it ſhall continually loſe to
the quantity of 19 Minutes, 29 Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds;
then from the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> to
the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> it ſhall gain; but this
gaining amounting to but about nine
Minutes, 43 Seconds, it ſhall ſtill be
too ſlow by 9 Minutes, 46 Seconds;
becauſe its gaining now ſhall not be ſo
much as it loſt before, by 9 Minutes,
43 Seconds: Then again, from the
<hi>16th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> it ſhall loſe afreſh till the
<hi>21ſt</hi> of <hi>October;</hi> which ſecond loſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48793:16"/>
to about 22 Minutes, 9 Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds,
this added to the time that it
was too ſlow on the laſt account, ſhall
amount to 31 Minutes, 55 Seconds,
and ſo much it ſhall be too ſlow
on the <hi>21ſt</hi> of <hi>October;</hi> from whence
it ſhall gain afreſh till the laſt of
<hi>January,</hi> to the quantity of 31 Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,
55 Seconds; which being
equal to what it was before too ſlow,
ſhall cauſe it to come right to the
ſame Dial with which it was ſet
twelve Months before, altho' it
went too ſlow the whole Year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide.</p>
            <p>Again, let a Clock be ſet right
the <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> it ſhall from
thence gain time till the laſt of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary;</hi>
and this gain ſhall amount
to 31 Minutes, 55 Seconds; then
from the firſt of <hi>February</hi> to the <hi>4th</hi>
of <hi>May,</hi> it ſhall loſe 19 Minutes,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48793:16"/>
29 Seconds, which being leſs than
the 31 Minutes, 55 Seconds, which
before it had got, by about 12 Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,
26 Seconds, it ſhall ſtill be
too faſt by 12 Minutes 26 Seconds:
Then from the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> to the
<hi>15th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> it ſhall gain anew to
the quantity of about 9 Minutes
43 Seconds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which added to the
time it was too faſt before, ſhall
amount to 22 Minutes, 9 Seconds,
and ſo much it ſhall be too faſt
on the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>July;</hi> from which
time till the <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> it
ſhall loſe this 22 Minutes, 9 Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds,
and by Conſequence come
right to the ſame Dial with
which it was ſet twelve Months
before.</p>
            <p>Thus ſhall one and the ſame
Clock, with the ſame pitch of
Motion, go alwayes too ſlow if
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48793:17"/>
ſet at one time of the Year, and
always too faſt if ſet at another
time, if it be let go the whole Year
about.</p>
            <p>Moreover, if ſet at ſome other
times, and then continued in its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for a Year, without ſetting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new,
it ſhall both gain and loſe,
be ſometimes too faſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
too ſlow: For if a well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted
<hi>Pendulum</hi> be ſet right to the
Sun the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> by the <hi>15th</hi> of
<hi>July</hi> it ſhall be 9 Minutes, 43 Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds
too faſt: From this <hi>15th</hi> of
<hi>July</hi> to the <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> having
loſt 22 Minutes, 9 Seconds; from
which ſubſtracting the 9 Minutes,
43 Seconds that it was before too
faſt, there remains 12 Minutes, 26
Seconds; and ſo much it ſhall be
too ſlow on the <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>October;</hi>
from which day it ſhall begin to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48793:17"/>
gain, and continue ſo to do till the
firſt of <hi>January,</hi> by which time the
Clock having got 31 Minutes, 55
Seconds, which amounting to about
19 Minutes, 29 Seconds above what
it was too ſlow on the <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
it ſhall by Conſequence be now
19 Minutes, 29 Seconds too faſt;
from whence to the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> it
ſhall loſe what now it is too faſt,
and ſo come right to the ſame Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
with. which it was before ſet.</p>
            <p>Again, ſet a Clock to the Sun
the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> and if it be well
adjuſted, it ſhall by the <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
be 22 Minutes, 9 Seconds too
ſlow; from whence to the laſt of
<hi>January,</hi> it being to gain 31 Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,
55 Seconds, it ſhall be then
9 Minutes, 46 Second<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> too faſt;
from which time to the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:48793:18"/>
it loſing 19 Minutes, 29 Seconds,
it ſhall then be 9 Minutes, 29 Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds
too ſlow; which time by
the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> ſhall again be got,
and ſo the Clock ſhall come right
to the ſame Dial.</p>
            <p>Thus, by this Table, are theſe
great Varieties diſcoverable in the
Motion of the beſt adjuſted <hi>Pendu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi>
according to the different times
of the Year that it is ſet in; that
the ſame <hi>Pendulum</hi> ſet right upon
the firſt of <hi>February,</hi> ſhall go always
too ſlow till the ſame day twelve-month;
but if ſet right the <hi>23d</hi> of
<hi>October,</hi> it ſhall the whole Year
round be ſtill too faſt, till the ſame
day on which it was ſet: The ſame
Clock being alſo ſet to the Hour
on the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> or the <hi>15th</hi> of
<hi>July,</hi> ſhall on the following Year
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48793:18"/>
be ſometimes too faſt, and at other
times too ſlow. Theſe are all ſtrange
and unaccountable things to ſuch as
underſtand not the Nature of the
Unequality of Time, from whence
all theſe Varieties do ſtill ariſe, and
are ſcarcely to be demonſtrated to
the Underſtanding by any other
way, than by this or ſome other
Table of the <hi>Aequation of Time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since therefore there is a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for ſetting Clocks a-new to the
Sun, at ſome times, that they may
be kept as near as poſſible to the
apparent time given by a Dial; I
adviſe that this ſetting may be, if
poſſible, the firſt day of every
Month; ſo may you the better dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
by the Time ſet down at the
bottom of every Column, whether
your Clock have gone right to the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48793:19"/>
mean time, and be as exact in his
Motion as 'tis poſſible to bring him
to: For if it be exactly adjuſted, it
will then either gain or loſe near
that time that is ſet down at the
bottom of every Month, thoſe Sums
being nothing elſe but the Aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the whole Month added
together into one Summ, as before
I directed, when I gave you the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of adjuſting a <hi>Pendulum</hi> to the
true or mean time: But in caſe
you cannot ſet it right the firſt day,
then muſt you be at a little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to add together the <hi>Aequations</hi>
your ſelf, at ſuch time as you come
to ſet it a-new; but when the Clock
is well adjuſted, there needs little of
this trouble, being aſſured that it's
brought to the neareſt pitch of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it's capable of; and that when
it is at any time found to differ
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48793:19"/>
from the Sun, it muſt be lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as the natural Conſequence of
the Unequality of Time, and not
any Deficiency in the Motion of the
Clock.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak this of thoſe long and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<hi>Pendulums</hi> that vibrate within
the Compaſs of 2 or 3 Inches; for
the leſs Compaſs a <hi>Pendulum</hi> takes,
the more ſteady is it's Motion, not
being ſo ſubject to riſe and fall, as
others are, that vibrate in a larger
Compaſs. As for thoſe ſhorter <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulums</hi>
of a Foot long, or under,
although they may go very ſteady
for the moſt part, if Froſt or foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
hinder not, yet are they not
at all intended in this Diſcourse,
their Motion being apt to an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
in ſome Caſes; for a ſhort
<hi>Pendulum</hi> that goes well when clean,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48793:20"/>
ſhall go faſter than the mean time
when foul, becauſe the <hi>Pendulum</hi> is
by the foulneſs hindred from taking
its wonted Compaſs: The ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
does Froſt produce; for by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealing
the Oyl in the Pevets, its
freedom of Motion is interrupted,
ſo that the Pendulum not fetching
it's wonted Compaſs, ſhall go too
faſt; but thoſe long and curious
Pendulums of 40 Inches, that fetch
not above three Inches compaſs,
they are ſo exact, that being once
adjuſted they ſhall alwayes keep
the ſame time, if their motion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue;
for if the Pendulum ſhould
fetch a ſmaller compaſs, their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
would ceaſe, and themſelves
ſtand ſtill.</p>
            <p>When ſuch a Pendulum as this
is well adjuſted, you may truſt to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48793:20"/>
it, as to it's correſpondence in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with the mean time, and only
give your ſelf the trouble ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to ſet it a little forward or
backward, according to what the
unequality of Time has made it to
differ from the ſame Dial with
which you did uſe to ſet it; which
times of ſetting may be, as I ſaid
before, once in a Month; yet if the
Table be well noted, you ſhall
find, there be ſome times in the year
in which a good Clock may go a
longer time without any material
difference from the time given by
a Dial: For Example,</p>
            <p>Suppoſe you ſet a Clock right
to the Sun the firſt of <hi>January,</hi> this
Clock if let go till the firſt of <hi>March,</hi>
ſhall then be but two Minutes four
Seconds too faſt; for though it gain
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48793:21"/>
in <hi>January</hi> ſix Minutes, no great
matter, yet loſing in the next
Month about four Minutes, it ſhall
at the end of that Month be but
two Minutes to faſt; nay, if let go
another Month, as to the laſt of
<hi>March</hi> is, it ſhall then differ but
about ſeven Minutes, which is no
great matter. Moreover, if you ſet
a Clock the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> it ſhall, if
let go till <hi>June,</hi> loſe but two Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
thirty five Seconds in the
whole, though it ſhall at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of <hi>May</hi> be about five Minutes
to ſlow, which is no great matter;
ſo alſo if it be ſet right the firſt of
<hi>June,</hi> it may well go without ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
till the firſt of <hi>September;</hi> for
though it gain five Minutes in <hi>June,</hi>
yet loſing eight Minutes in <hi>Auguſt,</hi>
it ſhall then be but about three
Minutes too ſlow in this three
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48793:21"/>
Months time; but at ſome other
times, as from <hi>February</hi> to <hi>May,</hi> if
a Clock were let go 'twill be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
out, loſing above eighteen
Minutes; ſo alſo in <hi>November, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi>
and <hi>January,</hi> in which time
it will gain above thirty Minutes.</p>
            <p>By the Table you may alſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
find out, what difference there
is between the lengths of any two
daies in this manner: Firſt, If the
daies are both ſhorter, or both long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than the mean day, then ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
the Equation in the Table
belonging to one day from the
Equation of the other, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
ſhall ſhew their difference
in length. But if the daies be one
longer than the mean, and the
other ſhorter, then add the two
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48793:22"/>
Equations together, and the ſumm
ſhall be the time that they differ
in length: Thus the tenth of <hi>Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
will be found to be thirteen
Seconds longer than the tenth of
<hi>May;</hi> alſo the fifteenth of <hi>September</hi>
will be found to be fifty one Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds
ſhorter than the fifteenth of
<hi>December.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> That if men be very nice
in keeping a Clock true to the
Sun, they ſhould then make uſe, if
poſſible, of but one time on the
Dial that they ſet it with, and that
pretty near noon; for few Dials
being drawn exactly true, great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes
may ariſe, when a Clock is
ſet to one hour and then compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with another; and by reaſon
of refractions great errours may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48793:22"/>
ariſe; for the Sun by Refracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
being made to appear higher
than really ſhe is, there can be no
certain account taken of the time
till near Noon, where Refractions
ceaſe: And when all this care is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
in regard it is ſo very hard to
diſtinguish Minutes by the ſhadow of
a Dial, you will be much more exact
if you do thus: Let two plain and
flat plates or boards, about ten Inches
ſquare, be joyned ſo cloſe together
that a Six-pence may but juſt go
between; let them be fixed ſo, that
this Cranney between them may
reſpect the true <hi>South;</hi> this will
give you the time to leſs than half
a Minute, by obſerving the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that the Suns beam is darted
through it, and caſt upon ſome
dark body that is plac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d on the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48793:23"/>
North-part to receive the light; ſo
that having thus the exact time,
when the Sun comes to every Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian,
it will be found a much
better way to adjuſt Clocks by
ſuch a device as this, than by the
trueſt Dial.</p>
            <p>One uſe more, and that a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
one, I ſhall add, that is this:
When a Clock is once well adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the mean or equal day, you
may then by this Table keep it
right to the time given by the
Sun, although you never ſet it
right to a Dial, nor ſee the Sun
above once a Year; to perform
this do thus: ſet your Clock right
to the Sun the firſt day of any one
Month, and then the Table ſtill
giving you the time it ſhould loſe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48793:23"/>
or gain in that whole Months
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ime, 'tis then but ſetting it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
or backward the firſt day
of the next Month what it either
hath got or loſt in the Month im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
preceding, and it will
then be right with the Sun as if it
had been ſet by a Dial, and ſo
from Month to Month you may
(by ſtill ſetting it either forward
or backward according to what the
Table tells you it will gain or
loſe) keep it true to the time giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
by the Sun, though it ſhould
never ſhine ſo as to give you an
opportunity to ſet it by a Dial
above once in the whole Year; but
be ſure your Clock be firſt well
adjuſted, or elſe there may be ſome
errour: Note, that for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it will be very convenient to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48793:24"/>
Paſte the Table it ſelf on a board,
and then putting it into a handſom
Frame, let it be hung up near the
Clock, that you may have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
recourſe to it on all occaſions,
eſpecially for this in particular;
for without the aſſiſtance of ſuch
a Table as this, I know no way
in the World to keep a Clock
right to the apparent time, in caſe
Clouds ſhould intercept the Beams
of the Sun for any long time to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
