            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I meane not the Brownists of <hi>Leyden</hi> and <hi>Amsterdam</hi> at <hi>New-Plimoth,</hi> who although by accident, ignorance, and wilfulnesse, have indured with a wonderfull patience, many losses and extremities; yet they subsist and prosper so well, not any of them will abandon the Country, but to the utmost of their powers increase their numbers: But of those which are gone within this eighteene moneths for Cape <hi>Anne,</hi> and the Bay of the <hi>Massachusets:</hi> those which are their chiefe <note place="margin">what they are that biginne this Plantation.</note> Vndertakers are Gentlemen of good estate, some of 500, some a thousand pound land a yeere, all which they say they will sell for the advancing this harmlesse and pious worke; men of good credit and well-beloved in their Country, not such as flye for debt, or any scandall at home, and are good Catholike Protestants according to the reformed Church of <hi>England,</hi> if not, it is well they are gone: the rest of them men of good meanes, or Arts, Occupations, and Qualities, much more fit for such a businesse, and better furnished of all necessaries if they arrive well, than was ever any Plantation went out of <hi>England:</hi> I will not say but some of them may be more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise than needs, nor that they all be so good as they should be,

for Christ had but twelue Apostles, and one was a traitor; and if there be no dissemblers among them, it is more than a wonder: therefore doe not condemne all for some; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they have as good authority from his Majesty as they could desire, if they doe ill, the losse is but their owne; if well, a great glory and exceeding good to this Kingdome, to make good at last what all our former conclusions have disgraced. Now they take not that course the <hi>Virginia</hi> company did <note place="margin">The bine of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia.</note> for the Planters there, their purses and lives were subject to some few here in <hi>London</hi> who were never there, that consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med all in Arguments, Projects, and their owne conceits, every yeere trying new conclusions, altering every thing yearely as they altered opinions, till they had consumed more than two hundred thousand pounds, and neere eight thousand mens lives.</p>
               <p>It is true, in the yeere of our Lord 1622. they were about seven or eight thousand English indifferently well furnished with most necessaries, and many of them grew to that height of bravery, living in that plenty and excesse, that went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not worth any thing, made the Company here thinke all the world was Oatmeale there, and all this proceeded by surviving those that died, nor were they ignorant to use as curious tricks there as here, and out of the juice of Tabacco, which at first they sold at such good rates, they regarded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Tabacco; a commodity then so vendable, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided them all things: and the loving Salvages their kinde friends, they trained so well up to shoot in a Peece, to hunt and kill them fowle, they became more expert than our owne Country-men, whose labours were more profitable to their Masters in planting Tabacco, and other businesse.</p>
               <p>This superfluity caused my poore beginnings scorned, or <note place="margin">The differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt my begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in Virginia and the proceedings of my successors.</note> to be spoken of but with much derision, that never sent Ship from thence fraught, but onely some small quantities of Wainscot, Clap-board, Pitch, Tar, Rosin, Sope-ashes, Glasse, Cedar, Cypresse, Blacke Walnut, Knees for Ships, Ash for Pikes, Iron Ore none better, some Silver Ore, but so poore it was not regarded; better there may be, for I was no Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralist,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:22712:8"/>
some Sturgion, but it was too tart of the Vinegar, which was of my owne store, for little came from them which was good; and Wine of the Countries wilde Grapes, but it was too sowre, yet better than they sent us any: in two or three yeeres but one Hogshead of Claret. Onely speading my time to revenge my imprisonment upon the harmlesse innocent Salvages, who by my cruelty I forced to feed me with their contribution, and to send any offended my idle humour to <hi>Iames</hi> towne to punish at mine owne discretion; or keepe their Kings and subjects in chaines, and make them worke. Things cleane contrary to my Commission; whilest I and my company tooke our needlesse pleasures in discovering the Countries about us, building of Forts, and such unnecessary fooleries, where an Egge-shell (as they writ) had beene suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient against such enemies; neglecting to answer the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants expectations with profit, feeding the Company onely with Letters and tastes of such commodities as we writ the Country would afford in time by industry, as Silke, Wines, Oyles of Olives, Rape, and Linsed, Rasons, Prunes, Flax, Hempe, and Iron, as for Tabacco, wee never then dreamt of it.</p>
               <p>Now because I sent not their ships full fraught home with those commodities, they kindly writ to me, if we failed the next returne, they would leave us there as banished men, as if houses and all those commodities did grow naturally, only for us to take at our pleasure, with such tedious Letters, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, and instructions, and most contrary to that was fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, we did admire how it was possible such wise men could <note place="margin">A strange mistake is wise men.</note> so torment themselves and us with such strange absurdities and impossibilities, making Religion their colour, when all their aime was nothing but present profit, as most plainly appeared, by sending us so many Refiners, Gold-smiths, Iewellers, Lapidarics, Stone-cutters, Tabacco-pipe-makers, Imbroderers, Perfumers, Silkemen, with all their appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, but materialls, and all those had great summes out of the common stocke: and so many spies and super-intendents over us, as if they supposed we would turne Rebels, all stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

to suppresse and advance they knew not what: at last got a Commission in their owne names, promising the King custome within seven yeares, where we were free for one and twenty, appointing the Lord <hi>De-la-ware</hi> for Governour, with as many great and stately officers, and offices under him, as doth belong to a great Kingdome, with good summes for their extraordinary expences; also privileges for Cities, Charters, for Corporations, Universities, Free-schooles, and Glebe-land, putting all those in practice before there were either people, students, or schollers to build or use them, or provision and victuall to feed them were then there: and to amend this, most of the Tradesmen in <hi>London</hi> that would adventure but twelue pounds ten shillings, had the furnishing the Company of all such things as belonged to his trade, such jugling there was betwixt them, and such intruding Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties their associats, that all the trash they could get in <hi>London</hi> was sent us to <hi>Uirginia,</hi> they being well payed for that was good. Much they blamed us for not converting the Salvages, when those they sent us were little better, if nor worse, nor did they all convert any of those we sent them to <hi>England</hi> for that purpose. So doating of Mines of gold, and the South Sea, that all the world could not have devised better courses to bring us to ruine than they did themselves, with many more such like strange concoits; by this you may avoid the like inconveniences, and take heed by those examples, you have not too many irons in the fire at once, neither such change of Governours, nor such a multitude of Officers, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more Masters, Gentlemen, Gentlewomen, and children, than you have men to worke, which idle charge you will finde very troublesome, and the effects dangerous, and one hundred good labourers better than a thousand such Gallants as were sent me, that could doe nothing but complaine, curse, and despaire, when they saw our miseries, and all things so cleane contrary to the report in <hi>England,</hi> yet must I provide as well for them as for my selfe.</p>

Now although there be Deere in the woods, Fish in the rivers, and Fowles in abundance in their seasons; yet the woods are so wide, the rivers so broad, and the beasts so wild, and wee so unskilfull to catch them, wee little troubled them nor they us: for all this our letters that still signified unto them the plaine truth, would not be beleeved, because they required such things as was most necessary: but their opinion was otherwayes, for they desired but to packe over so many as they could, saying necessity would make them get victuals for themselves, as for good labourers they were more usefull here in <hi>England:</hi> but they found it otherwayes; the charge was all one to send a workman as a roarer, whose clamors to appease, we had much adoe to get fish and corne to maintaine them from one supply till another came with more loyterers without victuals still to make us worse and worse, for the most of them would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther starve than worke; yet had it not beene for some few that were Gentlemen, both by birth, industry, and discretion, we could not possibly have subsisted.</p>

                  <p>Our right to those Countries, true reasons for plantations, rare examples.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MAny good religious devout men have made it a <note place="margin">By what right wee may possesse those Countries law fully.</note> great question, as a matter in conscience, by what warrant they might goe to possesse those Countries, which are none of theirs, but the poore Salvages. Which poore curiosity will answer it selfe; for God did make the world to be inhabited with mankind, and to have his name knowne to all Nations, and from generation to generation: as the people increased they dispersed themselves into such Countries as they found most convenient. And here in <hi>Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, Virginia, New-England,</hi> and <hi>Cannada,</hi> is more land than all the people in Christendome can manure, and yet more to spare than all the natives of those Countries can use and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turate. And shall we here keepe such a coyle for land, and as such great rents and rates, when there is so much of the world uninhabited, and as much more in other places, and as good, or rather better than any wee possesse, were it manured and used accordingly. If this be not a reason sufficient to such ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der consciences; for a copper kettle and a few toyes, as beads and hatchets, they will fell you a whole Countrey; and for a small matter, their houses and the ground they dwell upon; but those of the <hi>Massachusets</hi> have resigned theirs freely.</p>
               <p>Now the reasons for plantations are many; <hi>Adam</hi> and <note place="margin">True reasons for those plantations.</note> 
                  <hi>Eve</hi> did first begin this innocent worke to plant the earth to remaine to posterity, but not without labour, trouble, and industry: <hi>Noah</hi> and his family began againe the second plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and their seed as it still increased, hath still planted new Countries, and one Country another, and so the world to that estate it is; but not without much hazard, travell, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talities, discontents, and many disasters: had those worthy Fathers and their memorable off-spring not beene more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent for us now in those ages, than wee are to plant that yet unplanted for after-livers. Had the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> our
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:22712:12"/>
Saviour Christ Jesus and his Apostles, exposed themselves to no more dangers to plant the Gospell wee so much professe, than we, even we our selves had at this present beene as Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages, and as miserable as the most barbarous Salvage, yet uncivilized. The <hi>Hebrewes, Lacedemonians,</hi> the <hi>Goths, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, Romans,</hi> and the rest, what was it they would not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to inlarge their Territories, inrich their subjects, and resist their enemies. Those that were the founders of those great Monarchies and their vertues, were no silvered idle gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Pharisies, but industrious honest hearted Publicans, they regarded more provisions and necessaries for their people, than jewels, ease and delight for themselves; riches was their servants, not their masters; they ruled as fathers, not as tyrants; their people as children, not as slaves; there was no disaster could discourage them; and let none thinke they incountered not with all manner of incumbrances, and what hath ever beene the worke of the best great Princes of the world, but planting of Countries, and civilizing barbarous and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nations to civility and humanity, whose eternall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons fils our histories with more honour than those that have wasted and consumed them by warres.</p>

               <p>At last, upon those inducements, some well disposed Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists, as they are tearmed, with some Gentlemen and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of <hi>Layden</hi> and <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> to save charges, would try their owne conclusions, though with great losse and much miserie, till time had taught them to see their owne error; for such humorists will never beleeve well, till they bee beaten with their owne rod.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>AT <hi>New-Plimoth,</hi> having planted there Fields and <note place="margin">1623.</note> Gardens, such an extraordinary drought insued, all things withered, that they expected no harvest; and having long expected a supply, they heard no newes, but a wracke split upon their Coast, they supposed their Ship: thus in the very labyrinth of despaire, they solemnly assembled themselves together nine houses in prayer. At their departure, the parching faire skies all overcast with blacke clouds, and the next morning, such a pleasant moderate raine continued fourteene daies, that it was hard to say, whether their withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red fruits or drooping affections were most revived; not long after came two Ships to supply them, with all their Passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers well, except one, and he presently recovered; for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, for all their wants, there was not one sicke person amongst them: the greater Ship they returned fraught with commodities. This yeare went from <hi>England,</hi> onely to fish, five and forty saile, and have all made a better voyage <note place="margin">Five and forty saile to fish.</note> than ever.</p>
               <p>In this Plantation there is about an hundred and fourescore <note place="margin">1624.</note> persons, some Cattell, but many Swine and Poultry: their Towne containes two and thirty houses, whereof seven were burnt, with the value of five or six hundred pounds in other goods, impailed about halfe a mile, within which within a high Mount, a Fort, with a Watch-tower, well built of stone, lome, and wood, their Ordnance well mounted, and so healthfull, that of the first Planters not one hath died this three yeares: yet at the first landing at <hi>Cape Cod,</hi> being an hundred passengers, besides twenty they had left behind at <hi>Plimoth</hi> for want of good take heed, thinking to finde all things better than I advised them, spent six or seven weekes in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:22712:19"/>
wandring up and downe in frost and snow, wind and raine, among the woods, cricks, and swamps, forty of them died, and threescore were left in most miserable estate at <hi>New-Plimoth,</hi> where their Ship left them, and but nine leagues by Sea from where they landed, whose misery and variable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, for want of experience, occasioned much faction, till necessity agreed them. These disasters, losses, and uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, made such disagreement among the Adventurers in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who beganne to repent, and rather lose all, than longer continue the charge, being out of purse six or seven thousand pounds, accounting my bookes and their relations as old Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manacks. But the Planters, rather than leave the Country, concluded absolutely to supply themselves, and to all their adventurers pay them for nine yeares two hundred pounds yearely without any other account; where more than six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Adventurers for <hi>Virginia,</hi> for more than two hundred thousand pounds, had not six pence. Since they have made a <note place="margin">They make store of good salt.</note> salt worke, wherewith they preserve all the fish they take, and have fraughted this yeare a ship of an hundred and foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score tun, living so well they desire nothing but more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and what ever they take, returne commodities to the value.</p>
               <p>Thus you may plainly see, although many envying I should bring so much from thence, where many others had beene, and some the same yeare returned with nothing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the Fish and Bevers I brought home, I had taken from the French men of <hi>Canada,</hi> to discourage any from beleeving me, and excuse their owne misprisions, some onely to have concealed this good Country (as is said) to their private use; others taxed me as much of indiscretion, to make my discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and designes so publike for nothing, which might have beene so well managed by some concealers, to have beene all rich ere any had knowne of it. Those, and many such like wise rewards, have beene my recompences, for which I am contented, so the Country prosper, and Gods name bee there praised by my Country-men, I have my desire; and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of this salt and fish, for breeding Mariners and building

Those Patentees procured a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, that no ship should goe thither to fish but pay them for the publike, as it was pretended, five pound upon <note place="margin">A Proclamation for New-England.</note> every thirty tuns of shipping, neither trade with the natives, cut downe wood, throw their balast over boord, nor plant without commission, leave and content to the Lord of that division or Mannor; some of which for some of them I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve will be tenantlesse this thousand yeare. Thus whereas this Country, as the contrivers of those projects, should have planted it selfe of it selfe, especially all the chiefe parts along the coast the first yeare, as they have oft told me, and chiefly by the fishing ships and some small helpe of their owne, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king men would be glad upon any termes to be admitted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their protections: but it proved so contrary, none would

               <p>Thus it lay againe in a manner vast, till those noble Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen <note place="margin">Memorandums for masters.</note> thus voluntarily undertooke it, whem I intreat to take this as a memorandum of my love, to make your plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations so neere and great as you can; for many hands make light worke, whereas yet your small parties can doe nothing availeable; nor stand too much upon the letting, setting, or selling those wild Countries, nor impose too much upon the commonalty either by your maggazines, which commonly eat out all poore mens labours, nor any other too hard impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition for present gaine; but let every man so it bee by order allotted him, plant freely without limitation so much as hee can, bee it by the halfes or otherwayes: And at the end of five or six yeares, or when you make a division, for every acre he hath planted, let him have twenty, thirty, forty, or an hundred; or as you finde hee hath extraordinarily deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, by it selfe to him and his heires for ever; all his charges being defrayed to his lord or master, and publike good: In so doing, a servant that will labour, within foure or five yeares <note place="margin">Incouragements for servants.</note> may live as well there as his master did here: for where there is so much land lie waste, it were a madnesse in a man at the first to buy, or hire, or pay anything more than an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement to whom it shall be due; and hee is double mad that will leave his friends, meanes, and freedome in <hi>England,</hi> to be worse there than here. Therefore let all men have as much freedome in reason as may be, and true dealing, for it is the greatest comfort you can give them, where the very name of servitude will breed much ill bloud, and become odious to God and man; but mildly temper correction with mercy, for I know well you will have occasion enough to use both; and in thus doing, doubtlesse God will blesse you, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly triple and multiply your numbers, the which to my utmost I will doe my best indevour.</p>

               <p>In the yeare 1629. about March, six good ships are gone with 350. men, women, and children, people professing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <note place="margin">Their provisions for Salem.</note> of good ranke, zeale, meanes and quality: also 150. head of cattell, as horse, mares, and neat beasts; 41. goats, some conies, with all provision for houshold and apparell; six peeces of great Ordnance for a Fort, with Muskets, Pikes, Corslets, Drums and Colours, with all provisions necessary for the good of man.

In the Iles you may keepe your hogs, horse, cattell, conies or poultry, and secure for little or nothing, and to command when you lift, onely having a care of provision for some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary cold winter. In those Iles, as in the maine, you may make your nurseries for fruits and plants where you put no cattell; in the maine you may shape your Orchards, Vineyards, Pastures, Gardens, Walkes, Parkes, and Corne fields out of the whole peece as you please into such plots, one adjoyning to another, leaving every of them invironed with two, three, foure, or six, or so many rowes of well growne trees as you will, ready growne to your hands, to defend them from ill weather, which in a champion you could not in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages; and this at first you may doe with as much facility, as carelesly or ignorantly cut downe all before you, and then after better consideration make ditches, pales, plant young trees with an excessive charge and labour, seeing you may have so many great and small growing trees for your maine posts, to fix hedges, palisados, houses, rales, or what you will; which order in <hi>Virginia</hi> hath not beene so well observed as it might: where all the woods for many an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred mile for the most part grow streight, like unto the high grove or tuft of trees, upon the high hill by the house of that worthy Knight Sir <hi>Humphrey Mildmay,</hi> so remarkable in <hi>Essex</hi> in the Parish of <hi>Danbery,</hi> where I writ this discourse, but much taller and greater, neither grow they so thicke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the halfe, and much good ground betweene them without shrubs, and the best is ever knowne by the greatnesse of the trees and the vesture it beareth. Now in <hi>New-England</hi> the trees are commonly lower, but much thicker and firmer wood, and more proper for shipping, of which I will speake a little, being the chiefe engine wee are to use in this worke, and the rather for that within a square of twenty leagues, you may have all, or most of the chiefe materials belonging to them, were they wrought to their perfection as in other places.</p>

that so well arived and promised so much, not being of one body, but severall mens servants, few could command and fewer obey, lived merrily of that they had, neither planting or building any thing to any purpose, but one faire house for the Governour, till all was spent and the winter approached; then they grew into many diseases, and as many inconveniences, depending only of a supply from <hi>England,</hi> which expected Houses, Gardens, and Corne fields ready planted by them for their entertainment.</p>
               <p>It is true, that Master <hi>Iohn Wynthrop,</hi> their now Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, a worthy Gentleman both in estate and esteeme, went so well provided (for six or seven hundred people went with him) as could be devised, but at Sea, such an extraordinarie storme encountred his Fleet, continuing ten daies, that of two hundred Cattell which were so tossed and brused, threescore and ten died, many of their people fell sicke, and in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed estate, after ten weekes, they arrived in <hi>New-England</hi> at severall times, where they found threescore of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple dead, the rest sicke, nothing done, but all complaining, and all things so contrary to their expectation, that now every monstrous humor began to shew it selfe. And to second this, neare as many more came after them, but so ill provided, with such multitudes of women and children, as redoubled their necessities.</p>
               <p>This small triall of their patience, caused among them no <note place="margin">The fruits of counterfeits.</note> small confusion, and put the Governour and his Councell to their utmost wits; some could not endure the name of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, others not the sight of a Crosse nor Surplesse, others by no meanes the booke of common Prayer. This absolute crue, only of the Elect, holding all (but such as themselves) repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates and cast-awaies, now make more haste to returne to <hi>Babel,</hi> as they tearmed <hi>England,</hi> than stay to enjoy the land they called <hi>Canaan;</hi> somewhat they must say to excuse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>Those he found Brownists, hee let goe for <hi>New-Plimoth,</hi> who are now betwixt foure or five hundred, and live well without want, some two hundred of the rest he was content to returne for <hi>England,</hi> whose clamors are as variable as their

humours and Auditors; some say they could see no timber of two foot diameter, some the Country is all Woods, others they drunke all the Springs and Ponds dry, yet like to famish for want of fresh water; some of the danger of the rattell Snake; and that others sold their provisions at what rates they pleased to them that wanted, and so returned to <hi>England</hi> great gainers out of others miseries; yet all that returned are not of those humors.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding all this, the noble Governour was no way disanimated, neither repents him of his enterprise for all those mistakes, but did order all things with that temperance and discretion, and so releeved those that wanted with his owne provision, that there is six or seven hundred remained with him, and more than 1600. English in all the Country, with three or foure hundred head of Cattell, as for Corne they are very ignorant: If upon the coast of <hi>America,</hi> they doe not before the end of this October (for toies) furnish themselves with two or three thousand bushels of Indian Corne, which is better than ours, and in a short time cause the Salvages to doe them as good service as their owne men, as I did in <hi>Virginia,</hi> and yet neither use cruelty nor tyranny amongst them; a consequence well worth putting in practice: and till it be effected, they will hardly doe well. I know ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance will say it is impossible, but this impossible taske, ever since the massacre in <hi>Virginia,</hi> I have beene a suter to have undertaken, but with 150. men, to have got Corne, fortified the Country, and discovered them more land than they all yet know or have demonstrated: but the Merchants common an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer was, necessity in time would force the Planters doe it themselves, and rather thus husbandly to lose ten sheepe, than be at the charge of a halfe penny worth of Tarre.</p>
               <p>Who is it that knowes not what a small handfull of Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards in the West Indies, subdued millions of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, <note place="margin">Note well.</note> so depopulating those Countries they conquered, that they are glad to buy <hi>Negroes</hi> in <hi>Affrica</hi> at a great rate, in Countries farre remote from them, which although they bee as idle and as devilish people as any in the world, yet they cause them quickly to bee their best servants; notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,

there is for every foure or five naturall Spaniards, two or three hundred Indians and Negros, and in <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>New-England</hi> more English than Salvages, that can assemble themselves to assault or hurt them, and it is much better to helpe to plant a country than unplant it and then replant it: but there Indians were in such multitudes, the Spaniards had no other remedy; and ours such a few, and so dispersed, it were nothing in a short time to bring them to labour and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>It is strange to me, that English men should not doe as much as any, but upon every sleight affront, in stead to amend it, we make it worse; notwithstanding the worst of all those ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, the better sort there are constant in their resolutions, and so are the most of their best friends here; and making provision to supply them, many conceit they make a death here, which is nothing so; for they would spend more here than they transport thither. One Ship this Summer with twenty cattell, and forty or fifty passengers, arived all well, and the Ship at home againe in nine weekes: another for all this exclamation of want, is returned with 10000. Corfish, and fourescore Kegs of Sturgion, which they did take and save when the season was neare past, and in the very heat of Summer, yet as good as can be. Since another ship is gone from <hi>Bristow,</hi> and many more a providing to follow them with all speed.</p>
               <p>Thus you may plainly see for all these rumours, they are in no such distresse as is supposed: as for their mischances, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisons, or what accidents may befall them, I hope none is so malicious, as attribute the fault to the Country nor mee; yet if some blame us not both, it were more than a wonder; for I am not ignorant that ignorance and too curious specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, make it a great part of their profession to censure (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever) any mans actions, who having lost the path to vertue, will make most excellent shifts to mount up any way; such incomparable connivenoy is in the Devils most punctuall cheaters, they will hazard a joint, but where God hath his Church they wil have a Chapel; a mischiefe so hard to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, that I have thus plainly adventured to shew my affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,

came, and surely God did most mercifully hearens, till the continuall inundations of mistaking directions, factions, and numbers of unprovided Libertines neere consumed us all, as the Israelites in the wildernesse.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding, out of the relicks of our miseries, time and <note place="margin">Their estates at this day.</note> experience had brought that Country to a great happinesse, had they not so much doated on their Tabacco, on whose fumish foundation there is small stability: there being so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good commodities besides, yet by it they have builded many pretty Villages, faire houses, and Chapels, which are growne good Benefices of 120. pounds a yeare, besides their owne mundall industry, but <hi>Iames</hi> towne was 500. pounds a yeare, as they say, appointed by the Councell here, allowed by the Councell there, and confirmed by the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> his Grace, Primate and Metrapolitan of all <hi>England. An.</hi> 1605. to master <hi>Richard Haeclutt</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend of <hi>Westminister,</hi> who by his authority sent master <hi>Robert Hunt,</hi> an honest, religious, and couragious Divine; during whose life our factions were oft qualified, our wants and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test extremities so comforted, that they seemed easie in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of what we endured after his memorable death.</p>
               <p>Now in <hi>New-England</hi> they have all our examples to teach <note place="margin">Their order of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in Salem.</note> them how to beware, and choice men, wee most ignorant in all things, or little better, therfore presage not the event of all such actions by our defailements: For they write, they doubt not ere long to be able to defend themselves against any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different enemy; in the interim, they have Preachers erected among themselves, and Gods true Religion (they say) taught amongst them, the Sabbath day observed, the common Prayer (as I understand) and Sermons performed, and diligent cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing, with strict and carefull exercise, and commendable good orders to bring those people with whom they have to deale withall into a Christian conversation, to live well, to feare God, serve the King, and love the Country; which done, in time from both those Plantations may grow a good addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> but <hi>Rome</hi> was not built in one day, whose beginnings was once as unhopefull as theirs, and to make them as eminent shall be my humble and hearty prayers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:22712:27"/>
But as yet it is not well understood of any authority they have sought for the government &amp; tranquillity of the Church, which doth cause those suspicions of factions in Religion, wherein although I be no Divine, yet I hope without offence <note place="margin">The miserable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of faction in Religion.</note> I may speake my opinion as well in this as I have done in the rest. He that will but truly consider the greatnesse of the Turks Empire and power here in Christendome, shall finde the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Turkes are generally of one religion, and the Christians in so many divisions and opinions, that they are among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves worse enemies than the Turkes, whose dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyntednesse hath given him that opportunity to command so many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand of Christians as he doth, where had they beene constant to one God, one Christ, and one Church, Christians might have beene more able to have commanded as many Turkes, as now the Turkes doe poore miserable Christians. Let this example remember you to beware of faction in that nature; for my owne part, I have seene many of you here in <hi>London</hi> goe to Church as orderly as any.</p>
               <p>Therefore I doubt not not but you will seeke to the prime authority of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for such an orderly au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <note place="margin">The necessity of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and authority.</note> as in most mens opinions is fit for you both to intreat for and to have, which I thinke will not be denied; and you have good reason, seeing you have such liberty to transport so many of his Majesties subjects, with all sorts of cattell, armes, and provision as you please, and can provide meanes to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish, nor can you have any certaine releefe, nor long subsist without more supplies from <hi>England.</hi> Besides, this might prevent many inconveniences may insue, and would clearely take away all those idle and malicious rumours, and occasion you many good and great friends and assistance you yet dreame not of; for you know better than I can tell, that the maintainers of good Orders and Lawes is the best preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation next God of a Kingdome: but when they are stuffed with hypocrisie and corruption, that state is not doubtfull but lamentable in a well setled Common-wealth, much more in such as yours, which is but a beginning, for as the Lawes cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, the state consumes.</p>

               <p>Concerning this point of a Cittadell, it is not the least, though the last remembred: therefore seeing you have such good meanes and power of your owne I never had, with the best convenient speed may be erect a Fort, a Castle or Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell, which in a manner is all one; towards the building, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, and maintenance thereof, every man for every acre he doth culturate to pay foure pence yearely, and some small matter out of every hundred of fish taken or used within five or ten miles, or as you please about it, it being the Center as a Fortresse for ever belonging to the State, and when the charge shall be defrayed to the chiefe undertaker, in reason, let him be Governour for his life: the overplus to goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the erecting another in like manner in a most conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient place, and so one after another, as your abilities can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish, by benevoleuces, forfeitures, fines, and impositions, as reason and the necessitie of the common good requireth; all men holding their lands on those manners as they doe of Churches, Universities, and Hospitals, but all depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one principall, and this would avoid all faction among the Superiours, extremities from the comminalty, &amp; none would repine at such payments, when they shall see it justly imployed for their owne defence and security; as for corruption in so small a Government, you may quickly perceive, and punish it accordingly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:22712:28"/>
Now as his Majesty hath made you custome-free for seven yeares, have a care that all your Country men shall come to <note place="margin">The condition of trade and freedome.</note> trade with you, be not troubled with Pilatage, Boyage, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corage, Wharfage, Custome, or any such tricks as hath beene lately used in most of new Plantations, where they would be Kings before their folly; to the discouragement of many, and a scorne to them of understanding, for Dutch, French, Biskin, or any will as yet use freely the Coast without controule, and why not English as well as they: Therefore use all commers with that respect, courtesie, and liberty is fitting, which in a short time will much increase your trade and shipping to fetch it from you, for as yet it were not good to adventure any more abroad with factors till you bee better provided; now there is nothing more inricheth a Common-wealth than much trade, nor no meanes better to increase than small cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, as <hi>Holland, Genua, Ligorne,</hi> and divers other places can well tell you, and doth most beggar those places where they take most custome, as <hi>Turkie,</hi> the <hi>Archipelagan Iles, Cicilia,</hi> the <hi>Spanish ports,</hi> but that their officers will connive to inrich themselves, though undoe the State.</p>
               <p>In this your infancy, imagine you have many eyes atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding your actions, some for one end, and some onely to finde fault; neglect therefore no opportunity, to informe his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty truly your orderly proceedings, which if it be to his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and contrary to the common rumour here in <hi>England,</hi> doubtlesse his Majesty will continue you custome free, till you have recovered your selves, and are able to subsist; for till such time, to take any custome from a Plantation, is not the way to make them prosper, nor is it likely those Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentees shall accomplish anything; that will neither main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them nor defend them, but with Countenances, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, and advice, which any reasonable man there may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter advise himselfe, than one thousand of them here who were never there; nor will any man, that hath any wit, throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into such a kinde of subjection, especially at his owne cost and charges; but it is too oft seene that sometimes one is enough to deceive one hundred, but two hundred not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to keepe one from being deceived.</p>

I speake not this to discourage any with vaine feares, but could <note place="margin">The Spaniards glory.</note> wish every English man to carry alwaies this Motto in his heart; Why should the brave Spanish Souldiers brag. The Sunne never sets in the Spanish dominions, but ever shineth on one part or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have conquered for our King; who within these few hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of yeares, was one of the least of most of his neighbours; but to animate us to doe the like for ours, who is no way his inferior; and truly there is no pleasure comparable to a generous spirit; as good imploiment in noble actions, especially amongst Turks, Heathens, and Infidels, to see daily new Countries, people, fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, governments, stratagems, releeve the oppressed, comfort his friends, passe miseries, subdue enemies, adventure upon any fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zable danger for God and his Country: it is true, it is a happy thing to be borne to strength, wealth, and honour, but that which is got by prowesse and magnanunity is the truest lustre; and those can the best distinguish content, that have escaped most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable dangers, as if out of every extremity he found himselfe now borne to a new life to learne how to amend and maintaine his age.</p>
               <p>Those harsh conclusions have so oft plundered me in those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed <note place="margin">Provisoes for exercise of armes.</note> actions, that if I could not freely expresse my selfe to them doth second them, I should thinke my selfe guilty of a most dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable crime worse than ingratitude; however some overweining capricious conceits, may attribute it to vaine-glory, ambition, or what other idle Epithete such pleased to bestow on me: But such trash I so much scorne, that I presume further to advise those, lesse advised than my selfe, that as your fish and trade increaseth, so let your forts and exercise of armes, drilling your men at your most convenient times, to ranke, file, march, skirmish, and retire, in file, manaples, battalia, or ambuskados, which service there is most proper; also how to assault and defend your forts, and be not sparing of a little extraordinary shot and powder to make them mark-men, especially your Gentlemen, and those you finde most capable, for shot must be your best weapon, yet all this will not doe unlesse you have atleast 100. or as many as you can, of expert, blouded, approved good Souldiers, who dare boldly lead them, not to shoot a ducke, a goose, or a dead marke, but at men, from whom you must expect such as you send. The want of

This great worke, though small in conceit, is not a worke for <note place="margin">What is requisite to be in a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> everyone to mannage such an affaire, as make a discovery, and plant a Colony, it requires all the best parts of art, judgement, courage, honesty, constancy, diligence, and industry, to doe but neere well; some are more proper for one thing than another, and therein best to be imployed, and nothing breeds more confusion than misplacing and misimploying men in their undertakings. <hi>Columbus, Curtes, Pitzara, Zotto, Magellanus,</hi> and the rest, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved more than an apprentiship to learne how to begin their most memorable attempts in the West Indies, which to the wonder of all ages, succesfully they effected, when many hundreds farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them in the worlds opinion, being instructed but by relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, scorning to follow their blunt examples, but in great state, with new inventions came to shame and confusion in actions of small moment, who doubtlesse in other matters, were both wise, discreet, generous and couragious. I say not this to detract any thing from their noblenesse, state, nor greatnesse, but to answer those questionlesse questions that keepe us from imitating the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers brave spirits, that advanced themselves from poore Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to great Captaines, their posterity to great Lords, and their King to be one of the greatest potentates on earth, and the fruits of their labours his greatest glory, power, and renowne.</p>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:22712:30"/>
when it is so contrary to nature and necessity, and yet as obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to government and their Soveraigne, as duty required. Now your best plea is to stand upon your guard, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide to defend as they did offend, especially at landing: if you be forced to retire, you have the advantage five for one in your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, wherein there is more discipline, than in a brave charge; and though it seeme lesse in fortune, it is as much in valour to defend as to get, but it is more easie to defend than assault, especially in woods where an enemy is ignorant. Lastly, remember as faction, pride, and security, produces nothing but confusion, miseric and dissolution; so the contraries well practised will in short time make you happy, and the most admired people of all our plantations for your time in the world.</p>
