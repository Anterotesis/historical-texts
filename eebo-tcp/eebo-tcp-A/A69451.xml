            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>IT has been the great unhappiness of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> for some Years last past, to be troubled with two very Different sort of Persons of quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Tempers; the one Party of so very Costive a Faith, that they could believe nothing, and the other of so easy a Belief that they could swallow every thing; the first of these could not see the Sun of Truth in its bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Meridian; and even Mathematical Demonstration signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied nothing in order to persuade them; they could not (or at least would not) see their Native Country hurried to the very Jaws of Ruine, and imitated <hi>Nero</hi> in his stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, who could unconcernedly Tune his Harp when <hi>Rome</hi> was in Flames; every thing about 'em seem'd pleasant and gay, they never suffered their minds to be rufled with anxious
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98713:4"/>
Thoughts for the Future, so they enjoy'd the present, and observ'd in the Literal (but corrupted) sence the command of our Saviour, to take no care for the Morrow; the most surprizing Relations mov'd them not a jot, and they gave as equal a Credit to an Information or Confession upon Oath, as they would have allow'd to a Chapter in <hi>Rablais</hi> his History of <hi>Garagantua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other were of a quite different stamp, they could cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit the most improbable Stories, and the most far fetcht Lyes were with them esteem'd as Oracles; they were ever at <hi>Coffee-houses</hi> or places of such resort, still listning to every idle Pamphleteer's Discourse, with more Attention than to a Sermon; they could not see a Chimney on Fire, but imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately some Treachery they believ'd was in agitation; and a Drunken Midnight Quarrel in the Streets Allarm'd their Thoughts into the Belief of a Massacre; they had nothing in their Mouths but Plots and Designs; and Holy Writ it self stood upon the same bottom in their Creed with some Witnesses Depositions; their Imagination hag-rid with Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious and Fears, daily presented them with such frightful Scenes, that they were not only uneasy to themselves, but likewise to all about them, which render'd their Days unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, and their Nights unquiet, insomuch that some of them durst not go to Bed for fear next Morning they should wake and find their Throats Cut.</p>
            <p>From these two very corrupt Humours in the late times; were produced those two odious Characters of <hi>Whigg</hi> and <hi>Tory,</hi> which were banded about so long in Jest, that they soon turn'd Earnest, and he was thought either a Knave or a Blockhead who would not suffer himself to be Dignified or Distinguished by one of those Titles. This Humour continued for some Years with great Violence and Disorder, during the latter end of the Reign of K. <hi>Charles</hi> the Second; in all which time 'tis obvious whoever wore the Crown, a great Person then at Court manag'd Affairs at the Helm.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:98713:4"/>
That <hi>great Prince</hi> (who had seen both the Extreams of a Prosperous and an Adverse Fortune) by his Death Yeilded the Throne to his only <hi>Brother,</hi> in the beginning of whose Reign the two Discriminating Names before mention'd seem'd to have been utterly forgotten; the former in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Prince</hi> the Darling of their thoughts and wishes now become a Monarch, and the latter in their mistaken apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of his unexpected Clemency in affording them Liberty of Conscience.</p>
            <p>The Storm was now abated, and Mens Tempers grew more compos'd, the Virtues of the Soveraign fill'd every Mouth with His Praises; His Goodness, His Justice, and His Piety was the Theme of common Discourse, and nothing but the Name of <hi>James the Just</hi> heard in the most ordinary Conversations.</p>
            <p>It does not become a Subject too nicely to inquire into the Miscarriages of a <hi>Crown'd Head;</hi> but this must be consest; very ill things were done, even to the Alteration of the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals both of our Religion and Government; and this must be own'd by every one whose Ears are not stopt by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Prejudice or Partiality.</p>
            <p>'Twould be vain labour to descend to particulars in a Discourse which is design'd to be of another Nature. The Jewish Feast of Tabernacles, tho' long time Abrogated by the coming of our Saviour, hinders not, nor forbids me to reflect on the Dangers I escap'd in the Wilderness. I may Lawfully, I think, select such Days in the Year to consider how Corporations were Regulated, Bishops Imprison'd, and other Irregularities committed in the late Reign, without as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling a Conventicle, and there in some lewd Harrang swell every Miscarriage to a prodigious greatness. The Actions of Princes (Evil ones especially) are their own proper Heralds, and every one of his Subjects carries some short Remarks of his Reign in their Memories.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:98713:5"/>
I do not believe that History can parallel the Joys and Triumphs of any Nation upon their Deliverance from Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, with the universal Triumphs of the <hi>English</hi> upon the never to be forgotten late <hi>Revolution;</hi> they seem'd like Men kept a long time in Durance, and now were blest with the sweets of Liberty; nay, even some of our present <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merers</hi> themselves were most forwardly Active to shew their Zeal for the then <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi> who by his coming seem'd to open the Scene of a new World, and restore the <hi>English</hi> to the Poet's time of the Golden Age again.</p>
            <p>But like true <hi>Israelites,</hi> we long again for the Onions and Garlick of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and would fain be under our old Task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters once more; the Wound which was seemingly Heal'd, is now broke out again, and what we lost in the Antient <hi>Tory,</hi> we find reviv'd in the Modern <hi>Jacobite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We were told in a Prophetick Discourse some years since, what Treatment we were to expect if a <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>Romish</hi> Communion should settle upon the Throne; the effects of which every one who is not wilfully Blind must acknowledg. Did he not drive <hi>Jehu-like</hi> in a full Carreer to <hi>Rome?</hi> Were not his <hi>Emisaries</hi> in every great Town in <hi>England</hi> Regulating Corporations, and Poisoning the Minds of the People with Popish Doctrins? Were not all places of Trust both Civil and Military fill'd up with those of the <hi>Romish</hi> Faith, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers whom he made use of for his own ends? Were they not come to an excessive hight of Impudence both in their Sermons and Discourses? Was not the Torrent swell'd so high that they hourly expected the Deluge? Were not the Fences of the Law (the Security of the Subject) attempted to be broke down? And <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> when in Opposition to the Princes will, be valued no more than a cancell'd Deed of Conveyance; Was not an <hi>Embassador</hi> sent to <hi>Rome,</hi> and a <hi>Nuntio</hi> Entertain'd here (to settle the Protestant Religion no doubt) and a thousand other Practices committed as directly opposite to the Interest of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, as Fire is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98713:5"/>
to Water. Was all this done in a corner? Were not their Actions as barefaced as the Sun? And after all this, and the Deliverance we Enjoy, must we go into the House of Bondage again, and put on those Fetters we so lately shook off?</p>
            <p>Let the seeming warmth of this Parenthesis be a little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd; yet I must confess, such considerations as these are almost valid enough to justify a Passion, and make Anger ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear no Fault; for were the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> the only Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Rights of the <hi>late King James,</hi> the wonder would be little; bodies often Sympathise at a distance, and they by several Obligations are bound to wish him Success; and while they terminate in empty Hopes, let them still regale themselves with their airy Diet; I pity the deluded Creatures, but cannot blame them, because they Act upon their own Principles; and 'twould be as unnatural for them not to Pray for his Return, as for a <hi>Cardinal,</hi> in hopes of the <hi>Popedom,</hi> to wish success to the Protestant Forces; or a <hi>Calvinist</hi> to Drink a Health to <hi>Monsieur Catinat:</hi> But when a sort of Men guided, as they pretend, by the Dictates of an unerring Conscience, shall at this time of day openly declare for an exploded Interest, and these <hi>Protestants</hi> too, Men no ways leven'd with Popery, or any of her Doctrin's, but Zealous Maintainers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Devout and Pious, Charitable and Just, in the chief Employments of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the Brightest of the <hi>Golden Candlesticks:</hi> For these so openly to declare their Aversion to this Present Government, and their Fondness for the Last, is what does not a little ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and surprise (to use an Expression of Mr. <hi>Bays)</hi> and comes almost as near to a Miracle as <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A late very Eminent Doctor of the Church, when the Prosecution was Violent against the Dissenters, wrote a most Learned Tract, concerning the Nicety of a Scrupulous Conscience; wherein he very curiously Anatomizes the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Meanders and turnings of that invisible Operation, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98713:6"/>
Proves that Humour, Discontent and Interest do frequently wear the Livery of <hi>Conscience.</hi> How nice soever some may be in point of Religion, I wish these Gentlemen could ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit themselves from the forementioned Disguise with which they masquerade their Political Conscience.</p>
            <p>One would wonder what strange bewitching Sophistry the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> makes use of to blind the Understandings of her Votaries, to that degree, that they are continually mistaking their own Interest, and tamely to deliver up their Bodies, Souls, Reputation and Fortunes for the Reversion of <hi>Purgatory</hi> hereafter, only for the slight gratification of their humours here; and I appeal to the greatest asserter of King <hi>James</hi> his Interest, if they can produce any Crown'd Head in <hi>England</hi> since the Conquest, who was half so Infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated and Bigotted to the Interest of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the <hi>late King:</hi> Indeed we Read of a Religious <hi>Edward,</hi> and a Pious, Devout <hi>Henry;</hi> but our <hi>English</hi> History cannot afford us one Instance of a Prince who would Sacrifice his own Honour, his Kingdoms Safety, his Interest Abroad, and the Love of his Subjects at Home, meerly out of a mistaken Zeal to the Advancement of the <hi>Romish Faith;</hi> the most solemn Oaths and Protestations esteem'd no more than words of Course; and that which was held Sacred amongst all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, valued as nothing in competition with a Command from the Apostolick Chair: The old <hi>Lady at Rome</hi> with all her Wrinkles, has still some Charms to subdue great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and tho she has Abus'd, Depos'd, and Murther'd so many of her Lovers, yet she finds every day some new Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers who are proud of her Charms; a Practice which comes as near a Miracle, as any that <hi>Church</hi> in her <hi>Legends</hi> can boast of; and I hope some passages in the late Reign are not so forgotten, but they may serve to justify the truth of the Assertion.</p>
            <p>Indeed for our amusement we were once told by a popular Pen, <hi>That allowing a King upon the</hi> English <hi>Throne, Principled</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:98713:6"/>

            <p>Several other artifices were us'd, to let us conceive a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Prince no such terrible Bugbear as common Fame repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents him; as that the Idolatrous Superstition of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was by a long series of time so worn off the minds of the People, and the Reformation so strongly Rooted, the <hi>Church of England</hi> so firmly Establish'd, the <hi>Romanists</hi> so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested for their Innovations in Doctrin and Absurdity in Ceremonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that it was impossible ever to fix Popery here: But, alas, 'twas meer Delusion, we quickly saw through the Juggle, and the <hi>State-Quacks</hi> discover'd their Leigerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main tricks too openly; and had not Almighty God by a most surprising, and almost unparllel'd Providence Deliver'd us, I know not by this time, but that the Name <hi>Protestant</hi> had been as odious in <hi>England,</hi> as the Term of <hi>Hugonot</hi> is now in <hi>France;</hi> and the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Franciscans</hi> left their Cells in <hi>Lincolns-Inn-Fields</hi> and the <hi>Savoy,</hi> to have Sung their <hi>Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Coelorum</hi> in all the <hi>Cathedrals</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am not Ignorant how some Persons do still Magnifie the Merits of the <hi>late King,</hi> as to his Private Virtues, as his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Descended of the Blood Royal, his Inviolable tenderness
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98713:7"/>
for his Friend, the exact Correspondency of his Mouth and Heart, his Courage against the <hi>Dutch,</hi> &amp;c. but these were glimmering Rays of his, which shin'd upon some few only; for when he came to his Meridian, they chang'd their Nature, and the scorching Beams of his Zeal for his Religion got the Ascenednt of all his other Accomplishments, which so clouded his discerning Faculties, that he mistook his Friends for his Enemies, and his Enemies for his Friends; the most sage and deliberate Advices given him in opposition to beloved <hi>Jesuits,</hi> were censur'd as intrenchments upon his Prerogative, and the single <hi>Ipse Dixit</hi> of <hi>Father Peters,</hi> valued above the Joynt Council of the Realm; the Colledges of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridg</hi> esteem'd as Nurseries of Hereticks, and the President and Fellows of <hi>Magdelen Colledg</hi> most illegally Ejected from their just Rights, to receive upon the Foundation a sort of Sparks who were neither Schollars nor Gentlemen. Priviledg was swallow'd up by Prerogative, and <hi>Know I am your King,</hi> was a <hi>Supersedeas</hi> to all manner of humble Petitions and Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances; his <hi>Priests,</hi> those fatal Scorpions, he so hugg'd in his Bosom, were the chief Incendiaries, and contrary to our known Laws, swarm'd over from <hi>Doway</hi> and St. <hi>Omers,</hi> gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily gaping after Preferments, which they needed not have wanted, could his Will alone have placed them in Ecclefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Dignities; they must be humbly content with Titular and Imaginary Bishopricks <hi>in Nubibus,</hi> till the stubbern Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks who Enjoy'd 'em, would at once part with their Reasons and their Livings together.</p>
            <p>But the greatest occasion of his Arbitrary Government, and the <hi>Aera</hi> from whence he may date all his late Misfortunes, was his Friendship with the <hi>French King,</hi> a right Son of <hi>Ishma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> whose Hand is lifted up against every Man's, and every Man's against his; a Man who has not one single Virtue to counterballance that prodigious stock of Vices which harbour in his Breast; a Man who has built a Reputation upon the Ruins of his Neighbours Kingdoms; and yet with this <hi>Gallick</hi>

            <p>I perceive I am stopt in my Assertion, and a little Dabler in Politicks challenges me to prove the Contract: 'Tis true, we cannot shew the Original Deed, with their Signets and Names affixt to it; but he must surely be Delivered over to Unbelief, who cannot credit such Circumstances as serve to clear the matter from all doubt or hesitation: Who Promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Marriage of the Duke with the Princess of <hi>Modena?</hi> Who Defraid the Charges of her Journy, and Paid the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of her Fortune, but the <hi>French King?</hi> If this will not satisfie, pray examine <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Letter to Sir <hi>William Throgmorton;</hi> the Duke's then agent at the <hi>French Court,</hi> where he tells him, <hi>That when the Duke comes to be Master of our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, the King of</hi> France <hi>will have all reason to promise himself all that he can desire; for according to the Dukes mind, the Interest of the King of</hi> England, <hi>the King of</hi> France, <hi>and his Own, are so closely bound up together, that 'tis impossible to separate them one from the other, without the ruin of them all three; but being joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they must notwithstanding all opposition, become Invincible:</hi> There are other Letters between Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> and <hi>Father le Chaise</hi> which carry such undeniable Marks of a Contract between <hi>King James</hi> when <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Louis le Grand,</hi> that none but those Devested of common Sense, can have reason to doubt it: If this is not throughly convincing, let any one consult the <hi>Memorial</hi> given in by <hi>Monsieur d' Avaux,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Embassador at the <hi>Hague, Sept. 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

And now 'tis time to breath a while, and consider what are the those Regal Virtues, of which, if a Prince has not a share, he will hardly answer the expectations of his People, nor the ends of Government; they are generally recon'd to be Piety, Prudence, Justice, and Valour; but if his Piety degenerates into <hi>Biggottism,</hi> his Prudence into unsteady Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merousness, his Justice into acts of Cruelty and Severity, and his Valour into Rashness and Obstinacy; what ever his Flatterers may say of him, yet certainly he is unfit to Govern.</p>
            <p>Let the Reader apply the Character where he pleases, and find a <hi>Crown'd</hi> Head whereon to fix these four Vices, by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other name call'd Virtues. How much of the Comparison may fall to the <hi>late King</hi>'s share, we know not; but of his <hi>Bigottry, Zeal,</hi> (or what other Name you please) to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, I believe by this time the World wants not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd; for if for Arguments sake we should allow (what we cannot believe) <hi>viz.</hi> a Merit in Religious Actions, certainly the <hi>late King</hi> has bid the fairest for <hi>Cononization,</hi> after his Death, of all the Crown'd Heads who have liv'd these two <hi>Centuries,</hi> who would Sacrifice three Kingdoms to the Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cios of a Priest; but be it unto him according to his Faith; and indeed it is but just he should expect a Crown in Heaven, if for its sake he has lost one on Earth.</p>
            <p>This in a few Lines we have given the Character of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotted unfortunate Prince: But leaving him at his Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, let us a little return homewards, and observe a sort of Men who are so very Impatient under this Government, that their very Looks express their Discontent; they are as uneasy, tho in the Sun-shine of Liberty, as the Slaves at <hi>Algeirs</hi> are with their Chains; they cannot take an Oath to a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that will Protect 'em, and nothing will ever satisfy them, but the Return of their Old Master.</p>

Good God! to what stupidity is Mankind arriv'd? To dislike the most easy Government in the World, to Espouse that which is the most Barbarous in its Nature: A Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that in measures of Cruelty exceeds ev'n the most Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage Communities on the Coast of <hi>India!</hi> A Government so debauch'd with false Religion, that considering the Interest of Mankind, and the ill usage it exposes Mens Persons and Fortunes to, it could be almost wisht that such a Religion had never been known in the World. In the name of Wonder, what would these Gentlemen have? They were many of them (at least many pretended to be) uneasy under the last, when Popery and Arbitrary Government seem'd to come as an Armed Man; and now they are almost beyond the possibility of such Fears, they Murmur: Of what Mercurial Temper are the <hi>English</hi> compos'd, that they can never be setled? Popery was once their Terrour, and now that is remov'd, they fear they know not what; like Men in Feavers, they are Restless in this Bed, and when remov'd to another, are as uneasy in that. I appeal to any of them, if the pressures that gawl their Shoulders, either in their Persons or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, was not brought upon themselves by their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Obstinacy, for which Conscience is still the pretence; the Government would have them Live easy, and enjoy their Estates and Preferments both Civil and Ecclesiastical, nor would molest them while quiet they might sit under their Vines and under their Fig-Trees, but they will not; and if Men will turn themselves out of all, in compliance to a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, who can help it?</p>
            <p>It must be confest, that when once the Persons of Kings grow Contemptible, or little in the Eyes of their Subjects, their smallest Miscarriages are Magnified to that degree, as very often Terminates in their Ruin: But there is an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour on the other hand, when the worst Actions of Princes shall be thought Innocent (for according to some persons Creed, <hi>a King can do no wrong)</hi> and the belief of Passive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98713:9"/>
is carried so high, that even his Arbitrary Proceedings shall be winkt at: This is to exceed even the Arts of the <hi>Turkish Policy,</hi> who pay not a greater Veneration of their <hi>Grand Signiors,</hi> than some of our Zealots do to the <hi>late King,</hi> they solemnly drink his Health upon their Knees, and Pray for him in their Private Devotions affectionately; nor do they forget him in the Publick <hi>Liturgies</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> for every one knows the secret Mystery of Bless and Protect <hi>the King</hi> our Governour. To be short, nothing will serve them but his Return, to Redeem them out of their imaginary Bondage; for this they Wish, for this they Pray: Nay, the Jews themselves do not at this day with greater impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and mistaken Zeal expect the coming of the Messias, than these kind of Men do for the Restauration of <hi>King James</hi> to his Crown and Dignity.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore a little examin what specious Pretences they have for such an Ambition; and tho indeed they are as shy of Revealing the Secret, as they would be of a Fairy Treasure; yet by some expressions occasionally dropt in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, 'tis not very hard to Conjecture some of them.</p>
            <p>As first, they are great pretenders to Moral Justice; they say King <hi>James</hi> had a great deal of Wrong done him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Soveraign Prince, they are Obliged to see him Righted. Are they so? but who gave them the Commission? Their Conscience, they will tell you, but their Conscience is so great a Riddle, that it will never be Expounded; their Conscience would have King <hi>James</hi> in his Throne again, tho never so much Bloodshed and Miseries might ensue; their fondness to his Person closes their Eyes and stops their Ears to all the Calamities their fellow Subjects must necessarily suffer by such a Revolution; nay, this very Conscience of theirs, was one of the chief occasions which prompted the <hi>late King</hi> to commit those Arbitrary Actions in his shortliv'd Reign; they told him he might do what he pleas'd, and for
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98713:9"/>
his Actions, was accuntable to none but <hi>God,</hi> tho he should turn upside-down our Laws, Religion, and Liberties, and that we were tamely to submit our Necks to the Blow when ever he should Command it, in spite of Laws, tho it were in the Power of our Hands to save our selves by a just Defence. No wonder then upon such considerations as these, and prompted by the Native Cruelty of his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, he permitted those unaccountable Actions to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; and he is as much beholding to those fiery sticklers for the loss of his Crown, as he was to Father <hi>Pretre</hi>'s, and other Jesuetick Advice.</p>
            <p>It is the Nature of Mankind to covet Liberty, and to have all things about them easy and free: Now I would ask these Gentlemen what greater Freedom they can expect, were their beloved Prince Reinstated in his Throne again, than what they now Enjoy? Are not their Fortunes secur'd to them by the best Laws in the World? Who goes about to Invade their Properties, or devest them of their Estates? Yes, they Reply, some <hi>Bishops</hi> and other Ecclesiastical Persons have lost their Livings and Means of Subsistence, because:—Yes, the <hi>Because</hi> is very well known, because they cannot take the Oaths. It would have been wisht, that those Reverend Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons would have Inform'd the World with the Reasons of their Non-compliance, which might have regulated the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking minds of some of their <hi>Bigotted</hi> Followers, who out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do even the Votaries of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in an Implicit Faith; and believe 'tis not Lawful for them to Swear to the Government, because Dr. such a one refuses the Oaths. A very pretty conclusion; but allowing it to be Conscience in their own acceptation, I believe when Humour, Prejudice, and some other niceties are separated from it, the thing call'd Conscience will appear in this Case but an Airy No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

Some of the most Moderate of them, I confess, who are great Lovers of the <hi>late King,</hi> could wish him here again without the Assistance of the <hi>French;</hi> but if their Faith was but as strong and powerful as their Hopes, they might certainly remove Mountains, and joyn the <hi>Alps</hi> to St. <hi>Michaels-Mount</hi> in <hi>Cornwall;</hi> but these are Wishes as Improbable as they are Impossible to be Effected; for you may as easily separate Heat from Fire, or Moisture from Water, as divide the Interests of <hi>King James,</hi> from those of <hi>Lewis the Fourteenth;</hi> no, no, like <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his Twins they must Live and Dye together; and therefore these sort of Men deserve rather our Pity than our Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>But there are another sort who will have their Old Master return again, though by never such indirect Means; and are as glad when they hear of the Success of the <hi>French Arms,</hi> as they would be to Receive the News of the Death of some Decrepid Relation of theirs, who by his <hi>Exit,</hi> leaves them a plentiful Estate. And let <hi>Mons</hi> and <hi>Flanders, Savoy,</hi> and all the <hi>Confederate Countries</hi> be reduc'd to heaps of Ruins, so their <hi>Dear King</hi> may come to his Throne again, though he Enter'd the City of <hi>London</hi> with <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> and <hi>Boufflers</hi> at the Head of fifty Thousand <hi>French</hi> Dragoons.</p>
            <p>These are hopeful Protestants i'faith, blessed Reformers and Defenders of the Christian Church; fresh Straw and a dark Chamber, cooling Purges, Leeches and Blood-letting are only fit for such as these; they are Mad beyond the cure of <hi>Hellebore:</hi> But because it is necessary sometimes to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer a Fool according to his Folly. Let us ask 'em what mighty Mischiefs have the Dukes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Bavaria,</hi> the Electors of <hi>Brandenburgh, Mentz,</hi> and <hi>Cologne,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour

of <hi>Germany,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces</hi> done these Gentlemen, that they are so mighty An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with them, and could wish the Sculls of all their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were to Pave the way for King <hi>James</hi> his Accession to ae forfeited Throne? how came these involv'd in the Quarrel? must King <hi>James</hi> his supposed Right, like <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s Lean Kine, swallow up all other Princes Properties? What has he done to be so much the Darling of Mankind, that other Mens Glories must be Ecclips'd to make his Glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering Rays shine the Brighter? Are great <hi>Britain, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> to be the only <hi>Goshen,</hi> and must there be Darkness all over <hi>Europe</hi> besides? These Men are a most strange sort of Political Predestinarians, who will allow no Peace nor Plenty to any but their Master and his Friends; and it is hard to be determin'd, whether Folly or Madness has the greatest share in the Composition of their Hopes. All Pity and Humanity to their fellow Creatures is laid aside, and they seem to exceed the <hi>Indian Cannibals</hi> in acts of Cruelty, for how severe they may be to Strangers, they yet seldom Devour those of their own Tribe; no Man that hears 'em Discourse, can certainly keep within the bounds of Moderation; for who ever has the patience to hear their Arguments, will certainly expect better Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in <hi>Bedlam,</hi> from the <hi>Lucida Intervalla</hi> of a Luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</p>
            <p>The Love of ones Country, was ever by the most Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite Nations, esteem'd as the Characteristical mark of a Noble Soul, and <hi>Vincit Amor Patriae,</hi> seem'd to be Written in indelible Marks upon their Breasts; for this the ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> were Famous. Remarkable to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is the Relation <hi>Livy</hi> gives us of <hi>Curtius</hi> a Noble <hi>Roman,</hi> who when the Earth was sunk with a wide Gap in the Middle of the <hi>Forum,</hi> and it was told, it would not come together again, unless some Prime young Nobleman were

I would fain ask them, supposing the possibility of such Success, whether the <hi>French</hi> Arms are so well bred, as to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish them from the rest of the <hi>English</hi> Sufferers by such a Revolution (to which that of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> was but a civil Visit)? I fear like <hi>Tarpeia</hi> the Vestal Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, who Covenanted with the <hi>Sabines</hi> to betray the Capitol to them, for what they wore on their left Arms; but when they were Entred, into of Bracelets which she in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, they threw their Targets upon her, and Pressed her to Death; so would these very Men Suffer in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Calamity; for the <hi>French,</hi> as well as other Nations, agree in this, <hi>That though they Love the Treason, they Hate the Traytors.</hi>

themselves by his Return; unless like the unrewarded poor expecting <hi>Caviliers</hi> at the Restauration of King <hi>Charles the Second,</hi> they can be content to be Loyal and Starve; for if the latter end of King <hi>James</hi> his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Reign, should be of a piece with his first real begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he will still neglect his truest Friends, and stick close to Flattering Enemies.

            <p>But I have wandred from my Subject, by a long, but I hope, not very Impertinent Digression, and therefore (asking my Reader's Pardon) return to my Subject, or rather the Applicatory part of it. We have seen the Character of the Prince and his Bigotted followers; And as all things are best set off by Examples, let us now draw a Parallel or Landscape of the two different Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions of the Reigns of King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and King <hi>James,</hi> and what we are unavoidably to Expect, should Almighty God in the Course of his Providence, for our Punishment, and the gratification of some rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Spirits, bring King <hi>James</hi> to his Throne again: Of the Ease and Tranquility of the first we are certain, but of the Horrour of the latter, the most terrible Ideas we can form of it in our Imaginations will come short of the Life; for as the safety we now enjoy, almost exceeds our Hopes; so the Stripes we must then feel, will transcend our very Fears.</p>
            <p>In the Person of the King, we have a Prince who is truly (what the Historian says of <hi>Titus) Humani generis Deliciae,</hi> who has centred in his Person all the Valour and Wisdom of his Ancestors: A Prince so truly Great, that those Lawrels which add such Lustre to anothers Brow,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98713:12"/>
look but faintly on His, He needing no additional Varnish to set off His Native Goodness: A Prince, Born to be the <hi>Arbiter</hi> of <hi>Christendom,</hi> whom all the Crown'd Heads and States of <hi>Europe</hi> Adore as the only Person who must break the Jaws of the <hi>French Leviathan:</hi> Not the greatest Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which so terrify pusilanimous minds, can at all move Him, who caring not for an inactive inglorious Greatness, expos'd his Sacred Person to Rescue these ungrateful King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms from the moct insupportable Tyranny of Arbitrary Power; since which, in <hi>Ireland</hi> he gave most Invincible Proofs both of his Courage and Conduct; the United Force of <hi>Europe</hi> could not concert their Measures against <hi>France,</hi> till his Presence Influenced their Counsels at the <hi>Hague,</hi> to which he went through a thousand Perils at Sea; after a short Return, He is now gone again to <hi>Flanders</hi> to head that Prodigious Army: Victory seems to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him in Attempts of War, and his worst Enemies must own him to have the very Soul of Courage.</p>
            <p>In the Person of the <hi>Queen,</hi> we have a Second <hi>Queen Elizabeth;</hi> but with respect to her Sacred Ashes, we may say, the Copy far exceeds the Original. Never did a Crown'd Lady shew more Conduct and Magnanimity than when the <hi>French Fleet</hi> was upon our Coast, when her <hi>Illustrious Husband</hi> was Fighting in <hi>Ireland:</hi> A Princess, whose thousand Charms make her fit to Rule, and Command even Respect from her very Enemies (if any such there are;) her Majesty is Temper'd with so much Mildness, that at the same time, she neither invites nor forbids Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess; the Glory of her own Sex, and the Admiration of ours.</p>

over the Priviledges of the People, the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Flourishes, not withstanding the Peevishness of some of her Votaries; and the <hi>Dissenters</hi> enjoy their Liberty of Conscience without Design: The great Blessing of this Nation, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Parliament,</hi> does frequently Meet, and their Votes are Unanimous for Supplies for the Nations Good: The Taxes by them Levied are (excepting by some few discontented Spirits) willingly Paid, and the People satisfied that their Mony is Employ'd for the uses intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not Lavishly and Unaccountably thrown away on Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> every Man enjoys his Plentiful or Competent Fortune, with all the freedom Imaginable; no Tricks are made use of to Decoy us into Slavery; from the very Prospect of which, the <hi>King</hi> designs by his utmost Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to free us by appearing himself in Person at the Head of the Confederate Army, in opposition to the Power of <hi>France:</hi> He designing to Rescue the Glory of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Nation from that Stupidity, the Luxury, and Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacy of the late Reigns had obscur'd it with; and we have nothing to render us unhappy but our own ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Fears and Jealousies, in which unaccountable Humour, if we still persist, like the <hi>Seditious</hi> amongst the <hi>Jews,</hi> we shall do our selves more Mischief within the Walls, than our Enemies could possibly do without, when the Glory of their City and Nation yeilded to the Arms of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> who could never have Conquered them, had not their Murmurers within done more Execution to themselves, than all the Battering Rams of <hi>Titus</hi> could possibly Effect against their Walls.</p>
            <p>But now to shew the Reverse of the Medal. If King <hi>Jame</hi>'s return to re-assume his justly Forfeited Right, as no Human Reason can possibly suppose him to come in without the Assistance of the <hi>French,</hi> let us consider what a Field of Blood will our Country be; he coming in like a

Conqueror, will make us quickly Feel the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Easy Government we now Live under, and the Insupportable Tyranny we must then endure; his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Zeal for the Defence of the Protestant Religion, being long since quench't by the Affronts he pretends to have suffered by those of that Communion; then will <hi>Rome</hi> Erect her Standard in Defiance to all the Methods of the Reformation, and Popery become the standing Religion of the Nation.</p>
            <p>It cannot be suppos'd that the Instructions he has Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from his great Patrone <hi>Lewis,</hi> will easily be forgot; and he who when in a private Capacity would ever hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgive one whom he suppos'd had done him Wrong, will now be hardly brought to forget a National Indignity; he will never certainly listen to any Overtures of Capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and 'tis impossible to believe that things can be ever Accomodated between an Incens'd Prince, and (as he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses) a Rebellious People. He has not so long Breath'd in the Air of <hi>France,</hi> as not to learn its Tyrannical and Arbitrary Maxims; and the (as he thinks) Meritorious Zeal of Propagating his own Religion, will let him stick at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, how Arbitrary soever, to Establish it. We may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed imagin him to be of a Merciful Nature, and that all shall be forgotten as if never done, and that an Act of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity will make all even again; but those who are so blinded as to believe these fair Promises, let them but look into an Act of his own, Dated at his Residence in <hi>Dublin.</hi> And in a Proclamation of his, to his Pretended Subjects in <hi>Scotland, May</hi> 4. 1689. He is most Graciously Pleas'd, not only to Incourage his Friends to be Destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Mankind, but likewise offers them Pardons for such Inhuman Cruelties: Telling them in the said Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, <hi>'Tis his Pleasure they should Rise in Arms, and Assault and Destroy, and what ever Blood-shed and Slaughter, Mutilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>

               <hi>or Fire-raisings should be done to these Rebels,</hi> (as he calls the <hi>Scotch) his Proclamation should be their sufficient Warrant</hi> for such Acts. If this is his Kindness for the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation, can we think the <hi>English</hi> will more civilly be Treated?</p>
            <p>No, no, let us no longer Amuse our selves with Fancies of his Clemency and Kindness. We live under a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where we may be Hapy if we please, and nothing but our Discontent can render us Miserable; for as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as there is a Providence, if ever such a Fatal Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should happen, not <hi>Savoy,</hi> nor <hi>Piedmont,</hi> nor all the places where the Arms of the <hi>French</hi> have Ravag'd, were ever such Scenes of Blood and Confusion as <hi>England</hi> will be. We are now in our <hi>Crisis,</hi> and a few Months will, in all probability, determin the fate of <hi>Europe</hi> in General, and of our own Country in particular; and upon the Success of the Confederate Army, Headed by our most Victorious Prince, depends the Liberty or Slavery of the most Civiliz'd part of the World.</p>

Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality and Prejudice are very ill Spectacles, and but too often cause a false Medium. I have seen a Picture, which if one lookt Obliquely upon, on the left Hand were represented the Heads of three fair Ladies; but if you chang'd the Position of your Body, and stood on the right Hand of the Design, the very same Picture shew'd you a Monkey and two Parrots. I know not on which hand my Reader's Judgment stands, which valued Faculty of ours we find to be very often deluded; for if I may apply a place in Holy Writ, very pertinent to this purpose, only exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Case of the Father for that of the Son; they who form such terrible Ideas of the Imaginary Severities they feel under the present Reign, where they are only beaten with Rods, will at the Return of their Idoliz'd Prince, be Chastis'd with Scorpions.</hi>
