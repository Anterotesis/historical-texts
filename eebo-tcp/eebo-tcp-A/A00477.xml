            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hriſtian Reader, to deliuer vnto you the many wonders of the almightie God, with what ſigns &amp; tokens he hath ſhewed, would fill large volumes, and weary you with the hearing and reading of the ſame, wherfore omitting circumſtances, I ſhal here deliuer vnto you the truth and certaintie, by honeſt men approoued, and of good reckoning in the Townes where they dwell, the moſt ſtrange and wonderfull worke of God, lately ſhowne, in two ſeuerall Cities in the ſtreetes, not paſt two moneths ſince. The ſtraungenes and wonderfull worke whereof God grant may cauſe in vs true repentance of our ſinnes, and learne vs to amend our euill liues, putting of the olde ſinne and clothing vs a new, with the pure garment of faith, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to offend the Maieſtie of the moſt higheſt, and dreading to feele that vtter croſſe which was lately laid on our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, for their wickednes, and for our example.</p>
            <p>In the Country of <hi>Prouence,</hi> in a Towne called <hi>Tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonne,</hi> which holdeth for the King, yet are for the greater part Catholickes as they terme themſelues, in this towne, dwelled a Lady called Madam <hi>Deormoga,</hi> ſiſter to a man of good name, and late wife to a moſt braue and gallant man and a braue ſouldier while hee liued, and an earneſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſer of the trueth. This Madame <hi>Deermoga,</hi> the 24. of March now laſt paſt, ſupping at the Gouernours houſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her kinſman, chanced at the table to enter talke of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, being a zealous Proteſtant, on whome, there was ſo many bayting to drawe her from the trueth, as it did not a litle greeue the good Lady, hauing no bodie but God that defendeth the cauſe of the iuſt to ſay for her, or in any wiſe to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:15202:3"/>
helpe her to anſwere a word. After long communication hote on both ſides, a certaine Biſhop, which had ſome autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in that place threatned her, proteſting that the next day he would call her in queſtion, and ſo accuſing her of hereſie, put her to death, defying her with verie odious ſpeeches, and tearming her at his pleaſure, who was nobly borne and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie way his better.</p>
            <p>The time of night calling euery one to their reſt, they tooke leaue each of others, committing the Lord of the houſe to his quiet, but the Biſhop whoſe heart encenced with enuy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the Ladie, gaue her this cauiat, to bee the next day when ſhe ſhould be called of another minde, or elſe prouide to frie a faggot, affirming therewith by great oath that it was not for her ſake they had borne with her as they had.</p>
            <p>To whom the Lady <hi>Deormoga</hi> replied, aſſuring him that ſhe waied not what he or any Prieſt of <hi>Ball</hi> could do, for God was her defence, and by his paſſion ſhee hoped of euerlaſting life, daring him to doo what he could, alledging many places out of the ſcripture, wherein ſhe had ſure comfort and hope of Chriſt, not forgetting to put him in mind how God by his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer freed <hi>Daniel,</hi> the three children in the Ouen, <hi>Suſanna</hi> from the Elders, &amp; infinit others, ſeeing my Lord quoth ſhee, that ſuch is the power of my Sauiour, I feare not you nor what you can do: And ſo farewell: and fauour me as I ſhall deſire your friendſhip.</p>
            <p>Thus parted they, and the reſt of the company many the Ladies friends, which did know the condition of the Biſhop, and with what crueltie hee purſued thoſe whom hee enuied, knowing by his countenance, that he was throughly moued, greatly lamented the good Lady, albeit they liked not of her religion. But behold, the wonder of the great God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> how from the cruell iawes of this blood thirſtie Prelate, the Lord deliuered this verteous and innocent Ladie, euen as <hi>Phato</hi> with his hoſt was ouerwhelmed, ſo was this Biſhop ouertaken in his owne ſinne.</p>
            <p>The night being well ſpent ere the company parted, it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:15202:3"/>
was neere twelue a clocke ere the Biſhop was layde in his bed, where he had ſcarſly remained one houre and his people at quiet but throughout the houſe there was heard the moſt greeuous noyce that might be imagined, ſo that thoſe which awaked therewith, with the terrour thereof was neere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides themſelues. In this maner, for one houre or more, moſt odiouſly it continued, and euer the principall and chiefeſt therof was heard, towards the Biſhops owne lodging, who for that he called not, nor made any meanes for his ſeruants they laie all ſtill as full of feare as euer were men.</p>
            <p>Before two of the clocke the watch of the Towne deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Biſhops houſe a great fire, which no ſooner percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but they repaired to their Lieftenantes lodging, and him thereof aduertiſed, who doubting ſome treaſon, tooke with him fortie or fiftie of his company, and comming to the houſe adreſſed themſelues, to ſeeke reliefe for the ſtaying the ſame, firſt breaking open the gates and beſeeching the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the houſe to direct them for things neceſſary as lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and thinges to bring water, the ſeruants thus amazed at the ſodeinnes thereof could not tell what to doo, but lyke men diſtraught ranne vp and downe, at length one amongſt the reſt, called to minde their Lord, perceiuing the fire to bee neare his lodging cried out to the Lieftenant who was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the houſe buſied in ſetting the company a worke for help, and told him the feare he had of the Biſhop in whoſe lodging the fire was, vpon theſe ſpeeches the Lieftenant repaired to the Chamber doore which was yet whole, and with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany began to lift at it to get it open, where a voice ſhrill and fearfull, commanded them to let all reſt, for the Biſhop with his Idols and gold which he loued muſt periſh togither. The Lieftenant albeit a worthie Gentilman, was heereat more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, then if hee had been in the field enuironed with ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and forbeare his owne hands commanding the reſt to ſtay, who beeing full of courage continued ſtill, thinking it ſome ieaſt, or ſome illuſion, and were ſtriken, one lame, and two ſlaine out right.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:15202:4"/>The Lieftenant which ſawe this ſtrange ſtrategeme, was not a littell amazed, and lamentinge his people, cauſed them to be caried away, they that were on the outſide the howſe, heauinge water, was diuers times teryfied with the ſame voyce, who for lacke of gouerment regarded nothing, amongſt which ſo many were greuouſly hurt, ſome fell of the houſe ſo into the fire and were pitifully burnt, but in vaine was all their labour, for nothing might helpe or auaile the Biſhop till all was conſumed.</p>
            <p>By this daye approched when the houſe was neere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, when the Lieftenant with ſome of his followers ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the lodginge of the Byſhop, but founde all conſumed, &amp; nothing to be ſeene or heard of him, with the report of which had happned, the Lieftenant repayred to the lord Gouerner, and to him recounted what had hapned, with the fearfull voyces, which ſo terryfie them, at whoſe ſpeaches, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerner ſo much amazed as fleſhe might be, began to recount the power of the omnipotent God, who had wrought this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, amongſt many others to drawe the vnbeleeuers to knowe him, and to protect the innocent Ladye, from the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie of that balamite which had ſo profeſſed himſelfe her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimie, for the truthes ſake, the Ladie whoſe charitie excelled the cruiltie of the enuious Byſhop, greeued not a little for his death, and in charitie beſought his diuine mageſtie, not to impute his ſinnes vnto him.</p>
            <p>Loe thus the reward of bludthirſtines, he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> pretended the ouerthrow of this good Lady, was in his owne ſinnes ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, the Lorde make vs mindfull of his grace, thankfull for his benifites, and endue our hartes with charitie, ſend an vnitie in the Church and confound Idolatry.</p>
            <p>An other moſt rare exampele foure dayes after that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, lamentable and full of pitye, in the Citie of <hi>Arger</hi> in <hi>Turkie,</hi> as they were at praier according to the manner of the countrie, a moſt ſodaine darkenes fell vppon them, and preſentlye enſued ſuch a fearfull clap of thunder as would haue terified the hardeſt hart, with which alſo fell great ſtore
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:15202:4"/>
of lightening which fiered the one ende of the church, through which there enſued a moſt cruell fire, which conſumed the ſame in ſhort time, by which manie were ſlaine, ſome with the fal of ſtones, and dyuers by ſeeking to quench the ſame, the Gouerners houſe with dyuers others was likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed.</p>
            <p>Alſo a ſhip of corne and bread readie baked, which was ſtaied by the gouerner, bownde for the releefe of Telonne, which was greatly deſtreſſed, for it rarely was by this light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fiered and conſumed, the men being all priſoners, two dayes after which ſhip was conſumed, in the roade from the ſhip was ſeene to come ſo many Rattes as amazed men to behold, who recoueringe the ſhore, ſo greatly anoyed the citie that there dwelled none therein which complained not of the harme was done by them.</p>
            <p>Thus haue I for example, written this true hiſtorie, and lamentable ſtrategeme, for your benyfit, the like whereof hath ſeldom bine hard, the holy ſcriptures declare many wonders of the Lord, beſides what our eyes haue bene wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of, by many and ſeuerall ſignes in the ayre, monſterous byrthes and oher exterordinarie chances, all to drawe vs to amendment of life, which the God of all glorie graunt for his ſonne Ieſus Chriſtes ſake, Amen.</p>
