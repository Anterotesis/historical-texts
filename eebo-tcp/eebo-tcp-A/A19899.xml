            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

O no, it stands not with Gods iustice (if thou preuent it not by repentance) so to acquit thee.

            <p>BVt by the waie, I deeme it verie conuenient to speake (though to very small purpose I doubte) of that wherin the diuel is so much delighted, and where withall the worlde at thys daie is so greeuouslie infected.

is damned perpetuallie, there to abide and endure the violent paines whiche God hath ordained for him and his damnable associates; and he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shined in heauen as bright as the sunne in his highest beautie, is nowe through pride, transformed to a feend yea and that a most vglie and fearefull feend; whose horrible shape no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man can abide to looke vpon. Let a man haue wisdome, beauty, strength vertue, knowledge, honor and riches, and he shall vtterly obscure &amp; eclipse the glorie of them all, by vaine glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pride and statelinesse of mind. But this sinne generally hath more domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in women then men, whiche plainlie appeareth by their high looks, sumptuous ornaments, and fantastical attire, that it may truely be said, pride hath so infected them, that they be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen sicke of the fashions; whence it commeth that men are allured to lust that else might liue chast, the blazing beauty of women brightned by arte, so dazell the eies of their mindes and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,

            <p>Pride is a sinne of sinnes, fro whence (as branches from the tree) al and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sinne proceedeth: it troubled the angels ofheauen, yea and Christs deer saints and holy disciples on earth.

And to returne where (by occasion of this vanitie) I left) Call to minde, gentle Reader, the tyrannicall persecutions, and cruell martyrdomes perpetrated in the blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and pitilesse raigne of Queene Marie, imagine withall thou seest (as then to the griefe of many thousandes was seene) the tormenting furnace of Nabuchadnezer glowing hote, scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and consuming the fleshe and bones of Christes deere saintes and blessed martirs.

Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he hath visited and redeemed his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp; hath raised vs vp a Queene, by and vnder whose godly and gratious gouernment we may serue him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare, in true holinesse and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse before him all the daies of our life.

O but some will saie (if so they

durst) Sir you are too too extreame in hir commendation: you infringe the bounds of trueth, whereby it seemeth you aime at hir fauour by the leuell of flatterie.

            <p>To the second, be it graunted, that she is not vtterly faultlesse, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not vtterly blamelesse, I replie: she is (though a most gratious Queene as I said) a mortall creature, framed of the same substance that we be, and therefore subiect to those passions and infirmities that we are.
