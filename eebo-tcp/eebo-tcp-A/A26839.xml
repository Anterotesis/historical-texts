            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>SEeing that all Feavers are cauſed
by an aſcititious heat, and not by
a natural, as was ſaid before, it is
neceſſary we take their differences firſt
from the eſſence of heat, then from
the ſubject in which the Feaver is, or
from the manner of the motion of
heat, or from the cauſe of the Diſeaſe,
or from the matter, or ſymptomes.</p>
               <p>The firſt difference then is from the
eſſence of the praeternatural heat,<note place="margin">From the eſſence.</note> by
which ſome action is alwaies hurt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there is a receſſion from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
ſtate, and by how much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and more vehement this heat is, by
ſo much the greater ought the Feaver
to bee accounted; as for example, a
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, a Burning feaver may
be ſaid to bee greater than any other
Feaver, becauſe its heat being more
intenſe it appears more acrid and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55454:10"/>
than any other humoral Feaver;
but on the contrary, if you compare it
with an Hectick, it is leſs than that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this poſſeſſes the very ſubſtance
of the heart, but that the Humours
near unto it.</p>
               <p>Another difference may bee taken
from the ſubject wherein the Feaver is,<note place="margin">From the ſubject.</note>
as for example, by how much the
nobler the part affected is, by ſo much
the more vehement the Feaver, as that
Feaver which proceeds from a Phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
peripneumony, or inflammation
of the Lungs, or from a Pluriſie by
reaſon of the parts affected, ſhall bee
farre more dangerous than that which
follows an inflammation of the Reins,
Spleen, or Foot; beſides, the Feaver is
proportionate, or improportionate in
relation to the ſubject, and thence
ſhall be eſteemed greater or leſs, as a
Burning feaver is proportionate in a
Body hot and dry, of youthful age at
Midſummer, or in a hot and dry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,

               <p>The Third is from the manner of
the motion,<note place="margin">From the manner of the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and motions here, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a ſwift or ſlow tranſition
from one ſubject to another; the ſwift
motion is as often as the heat paſſeth
from a craſſe thick ſubject, to a tenuous
one, as for example; as oft as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting
Feaver doth paſs into a
continual or other putrid one; and on
the contrary, the ſlow motion is as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as an Ephemera or putrid feaver
degenerates into a Hectick, for the
Spirits are eaſier ſet a fire than the
Humours, and theſe eaſier than the
ſolid parts of heart and body; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
an unputrid Synochus being neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
doth eaſily paſs into a putrid
one, and ſo of other ſorts of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
               <p>The Fourth is from the efficient
cauſe,<note place="margin">From the efficient cauſe.</note> which is three-fold, the one
evident, the other internal, the third
occult; the evident is drawn from
thoſe Six non-natural things, as from
the air, inanition or repletion, &amp;c. the
internal from fluxions on the ſtomack
or lungs, obſtruction, crudities, or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55454:11"/>
putrefaction of humours, &amp;c. The
occult cauſe may be double, external,
and internal, the external as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact
of a Torpedo, impure copulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the uſe of malign and venenate
medicaments, &amp;c. from whence are
Feavers epidemical, endemical, ſpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical,
and peſtilential, ſaith <hi>Hippocrates</hi>
and <hi>Galen,</hi> the internal cauſe is hard to
bee diſcovered, becauſe beſides the
putrefaction, there is a certain venenate
air, or breath, which is for the moſt
part unknown to us, whether it depend
on the element of Stars, and therefore
is called by <hi>Hippocrates, Quid divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>

natural (if there be any ſuch) is the

there are ſome others which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from the continual, both in matter

for the matter of continual Feavers is
natural, but that of intermittings is
excrementitious; the ſeat and matter
of the continual, is in the great Veines,
but that of the intermitting without
them, as in the Liver, Stomach,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55454:16"/>
Spleen, Inteſtines, Meſentery, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
of the body, ſo that if excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
choler putrefie, it is called an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting
tertian, becauſe it recurres
every thrid day, begins with rigour,
and ſometimes with vomiting, if it be
exquiſite, whoſe fit is twelve hours, or
leſs, according to the quantity of cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
producing it, and is terminated
with Sweats, then ends in an apyrexy,

of this Diſeaſe is principally in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
likewiſe if excrementitious flegme
putrefie, out of the great Veſſels is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
an intermitting quotidian, whoſe
fit is eighteen hours by reaſon of its
coldneſs, craſſneſs, and clammineſs,
and it begins with a coldneſs of the
Noſe, Eares, Hands, and Feet, and
is terminated with a moyſture, and not
with ſweat as a tertian, the fountain
of this is the Stomach, if glaſsie flegme

kind of Feaver which the

melancholly excrementitious Humour
putrifie there, it begins with horrour,
and ſometimes with vomiting, as a
tertian, and the fit is twelve hours, or
more, or leſs, according to the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Humour, and recurres every
fourth day, and therefore is called a
quartan, which is the longeſt of all
Feavers, and hath its ſeat in the Spleen;
and ſo much for Feavers in the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours

continual, or intermitting; and
though <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> make

they proceed from any next kinde of

make a confuſe, and no Compound

Humours putrefie with melancholly
in the leſſer Veines altogether, and in
the ſame place, there ſhall bee two or

               <p>The Erratick,<note place="margin">The Erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</note> or inordinate Feaver

               <p>TO finde out the Reaſon of the
Circuits of intermitting Feavers
is of no ſmall moment amongſt the
Learned, for what one allows, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reprobates, every one applauding
his owne phanſie; leaving then their
nicities, I ſhall declare my owne opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
having premiſed ſomewhat for
elucidation of what ſhall follow; all
the parts of the body are endued with
four Faculties, to wit, the Attractive,
Retentive, Alterative, and Expulſive,
and as long as theſe are free from any
fault, man lives in perfect health, and
when one of theſe is too ſtrong for the
other, he is affected with various Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as if an excrement be inherent
to any part, and cannot bee expeld
from it by reaſon of its weakneſs, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
burthenſome to it, becauſe it is
neither diſcuſſed nor removed; or if
by reaſon of its coldneſs, craſſeneſs, or
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55454:19"/>
clammineſs, it obſtruct the paſſages
through which it ought to be expeld, it
putrefies, and cauſeth a Diſeaſe, and
the heat contracted by putrefaction is
very offenſive to the heat, and firſt of
all occupies and infeſts the Spirits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are tenuous, then the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
becauſe they are more cra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e;
and laſt of all the ſolid parts, and this
heat from the heart through the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
diſperſed to the whole body ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates
a Feaver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hurts our actions.
The cauſe then of the ſhortneſs or
length, of the anticipation or tardati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Circuits, may be taken from
theſe Six things <hi>viz.</hi> From the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of the Humour, from the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
quality, habit of the Body, diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of Strength, and complication
of Feavers.</p>
               <p>There are four Humours in the
Body,<note place="margin">From the Humour.</note> one of which exceeds the other
in quantity and quality, as if pure
bloud putrefie in the great Veines,
(which is hot and moyſt) it begets a
continual Synechis, if out of thoſe
Veines, it produces an intermitting, its
thinner part is turned into choler, and
the craſſer into melancholly, as
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55454:19"/>
                  <hi>Alexan. Aphrodiſ.</hi> learnedly notes.</p>
               <p>Another cauſe of the circuits is from
the quality of the Humour,<note place="margin">From the quality.</note> and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the part where the excrement is
heaped up; as flegme next to bloud
exceeds other Humours in quantity,
and being cold of quality, and moyſt,
craſſe, and clammy, by its frigidity it
reſiſts putrefaction, and by reaſon of
its craſſeneſs and clammineſs is not ſo
eaſily reſolved as bloud, and hence are
the length of its fits, and by reaſon of
the reliques and imbecillity of the part,
new excrement is heaped on it, thence
are new fits which recurre every day;
and if yellow choler putrefie in a part,
it cauſeth the like, though more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultly
than flegme, by reaſon of its
drineſs, by which it more powerfully
reſiſts putrefaction, and becauſe it is a
tenuous humour, and not craſſe, it is
farre more eaſily reſolved than flegme,
and leaves leſs reliques behind it in the
affected part; and hence is it that its
fits (which it cauſeth) doe ſooner end
in an infebricitation, and greater time
or interval is required for a new acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
but becauſe the part is debilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the former excrement, it readily
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55454:20"/>
receives the new, which putrefying as
before cauſeth a new fit, neither ſooner
nor later than the third day, and laſts
twelve hours, and is therefore called
a tertian, becauſe it recurres every
third day. The melancholly juyce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in a part doth not ſo eaſily pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefie
as other Humours, by reaſon of
its two qualities which reſiſt putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
<hi>viz.</hi> frigidity and ſiccity, and
therefore it intermits two daies, and
returns every fourth day; and though
the former matter bee emptied, yet
there is a weakneſs and diſpoſition of
the part (as in the other) to receive a
freſh humour, from whence follows a
new fit, which for the moſt part laſts
twelve hours, ſometimes more, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
leſs, according to the quantity
of the humour oppreſſing the part.</p>
               <p>The quantity of the Humour,<note place="margin">Object. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this opinion.</note> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
much or little, cannot of it ſelf be
the cauſe of the longitude, or brevity,
anticipation, or tardation of the fit, it
is true, a great quantity doth oppreſs
the part, and a ſmall is quickly reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
but that alone cannot be the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
cauſe, becauſe the ſame motion
is obſerved to bee from a ſmall and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55454:20"/>
great quantity, and that it is ſo, let
choler or melancholly be found in any
part of the body putrefied, it is moſt
certaine that choler will move neither
ſooner nor later than the third day,
nor melancholly than the fourth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the quantity of the Humour alone
cannot be the cauſe of the circuits, or
of the longitude, or &amp;c, of feaveriſh
fits.</p>
               <p>But rather the quality is the cauſe
of the length or ſhortneſs of the antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation,<note place="margin">From the quality.</note>
or poſt-poſition of the fits,
which your epileptical inſults ſeeme
to manifeſt, for they proceed not ſo
much from the quantity of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
as from the quality offenſive to
the braine, and thus Womens courſes
flow at ſet moneths and dayes, not by
reaſon of the quantity of the bloud,
but quality, whether they be much or
little, unleſs ſomewhat intervert the
courſe of Nature; and ſo wee muſt
judge of the Humours, in which there
is a certain occult quality, unknown
to us, which cauſes flegme every day,
yellow choler every third day, and
melancholly every fourth, to grow fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and bee moved; <hi>Hippocrates</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:55454:21"/>

               <p>The habit of the body whether
denſe or rare,<note place="margin">From the habit of the body.</note> may be the cauſe too, of
the length or ſhortneſs of the fits, but
the anticipation or tardation may bee
referred to the ſubſtance of the matter,
or to the multitude or paucity; the
ſubſtance is either craſſe or tenuous, if
craſſe and clammy the fits ſhall be lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
if tenuous ſhorter; if to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
or paucity, a little is eaſier diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated
and reſolved than a great deal,
from theſe two then, the anticipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or tardation of the fits may bee
cauſed.</p>
               <p>The Fifth cauſe of the Circuits may
be from the ſtrength,<note place="margin">From the ſtrength.</note> for if the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and expulſive faculty of every
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55454:21"/>
part be ſtrong, they will caſt off all the
excrement to the parts deſtined for it
by Nature; contrariwiſe, it they bee
both weak, that remaining doth by
degrees putrefie, becauſe it is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed,
and ſo it moves ſooner or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
according to its quantity, or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or both together, and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſmes
are longer, or ſhorter.</p>
               <p>The complication of Feavers may
change the courſe of Circuits,<note place="margin">From the complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> becauſe
ſome are from a cold Humour, craſſe
and clammy, others from a hot and
tenuous; ſo the one is moved, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and reſolved ſooner, the other
later, from whence is the ſhortneſs or
length of the fits; beſides our dyet,
whether good or bad, if in tempeſtivous
doth help or hurt much, or the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
intemperancy, and irregularity.</p>
               <p>The efficient cauſe of putrefaction
is either external,<note place="margin">The cauſe of putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</note> or internal; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
doth chiefly depend on corrupt
meats, or evil juyce, which can no
way be corrected by the help of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and which are apt to corrupt and
affect the Viſcera; the internal cauſe is
either from obſtruction, or the occurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of putrid things, for obſtruction, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55454:22"/>
by craſſe &amp; viſcid Humours hinders
perſpiration, and ſo the Humours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined,
and neither diſcuſſed, nor coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
doe eaſily putrefie though they
be good, and hence a Feaver; of the
ſame force is that obſtruction which
proceeds from a plenitude of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
which is above our ſtrength; for
they therefore putrefie becauſe they
cannot be concocted, nor governed by
our enfeebled ſtrength. The occurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of putred things doth firſt corrupt
the Spirits, then the Humours, as the
filthy exhalations, and putrefaction of
vapours, drawing in the Air from the

whole Diſeaſe, now of the Paroxyſme
or Fit, having firſt told what time is,
and what a Paroxyſme; a Period, or
Circuit, and what a Type, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they differ.</p>
               <p>Time is the number or meaſure of

of the morbifical matter, made ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the natural or preternatural
heat, ſince the times of Diſeaſes are
eſſentially meaſured by the mediate
paſſions cauſed in the living parts of
our bodies, and thoſe in relation to
coction.</p>
               <p>A Period is the time of intermiſſion
and remiſſion,<note place="margin">What a period is.</note> when a Feaver returns
from one place to the ſame againe, as
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55454:26"/>
for example, if a Tertian Ague begin

from the firſt invaſion and laſting to

Commentary on <hi>Aphoriſ.</hi> 12. Sect. 1.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55454:27"/>
and Chap. 3, 4, 5. of the times of Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
now to the acceſſion belong the
four firſt times, to the remiſſion, the
two laſt, which are now to be explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>The beginning is,<note place="margin">The firſt time.</note> when the matter
begins to be moved, and Nature hath
not yet begun to work upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>The inequality,<note place="margin">The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time.</note> when the matter
begins to putrefie, and putrid vapours
aſſault the heart, and a feaveriſh heat
is diffuſed without the heart, which
whiles it is expanding, Nature gives
battle againſt the matter.</p>
               <p>The augment is,<note place="margin">The third.</note> when the heat is
equally expanded throughout all
parts, and the heat is more intenſe, and
Nature re-acts on the morbifical mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>The ſtate is,<note place="margin">The fourth</note> when there is an omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modal
equality in the feaveriſh heat,
that is when the heat is extended
through all parts in an equal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
               <p>The declination is,<note place="margin">The fifth.</note> when there is a
gradual inequality of heat, or when
the heat is diminiſht, and Nature over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes,
and the ſeaveriſh heat for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55454:27"/>
the heart, and invades the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
parts and feet.</p>
               <p>The integrity is, when the Feaver is
quite off<note place="margin">The Sixth.</note> but theſe Six may very well
be reduced to Four, becauſe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of the inequality is reduced to the
beginning, the latter part to the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the integrity is no time of
the Feaver, but of the Period; and ſo
much of Feavers, whoſe matter is
moveable from place to place. Now
let us ſpeak of that matter which is not
moved, but remains in a part, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of its weakneſs, that it cannot expel
it, and therefore putrefies, and cauſeth
a putrid Feaver, which the matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
emptied doth intermit, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the imbecillity of the part is ſtill
remaining, and certaine ſeminaries of
the former matter, therefore a new
excrement is eaſily received, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
corrupted cauſeth a new fit.</p>
               <p>The beginning of theſe fits is, when
the ſuperfluity begins to putrefie,<note place="margin">The times of theſe putrid are but four.</note> the
augment when the fuliginous putrid
matter aſſaults the heart, and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
contained in it are inflamed, ſo
that its innate heat is made fiery hot,
the ſtate is when this fiery Fervor is
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55454:28"/>
brought to the height, and the de bate
is ſtrongeſt between the feavouriſh
heat and Nature, the declination is,
when Nature overcomes the fiery
heat, and expells it (if the matter bee
tenuous) by ſweat if the pores be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
and the expulſive faculty ſtrong,
or by Urine if thoſe paſſages be open,
or by the ſtoole if the matter be craſſe,
which is the way appointed by Nature
for ſuch excrements.</p>
               <p>The beginning of theſe Diſeaſes is
known from the pulſe rare and ſlow,<note place="margin">The ſignes of the times of theſe Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</note>
from a plumbeous or ſublivid colour, a
coldneſſe of the extreame parts, ſſoath,
ſadneſs, paine, and profound ſleep,
the heat being retracted to the
heart, and the braine refrigerated, from
their eye-lids ſcarce moveable, the
matter moving outwards and moleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

by the concuſſion of the rigour or hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,

                  </gap>brous Feavers, and

Feavers were either in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
or in the Humours, or in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
parts.</p>
               <p>In the Spirits is a Diary,<note place="margin">From whence the times of a Diary.</note> whoſe
times are not taken from the matter,
nor from the ſymptomes, but from
the eſſence of the preternatural heat
kindled in the vital ſpirit of the heart.
The whole fit of this Feaver is twenty
four hours, ſometimes ſhorter or lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
according to the quantity of the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55454:29"/>
febriſh heat, craſſeneſs of the ſpirits, the
ſtrength of the ſick, or thickneſſe of
the skin, but if it be exquiſite, it ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily

               <p>The Humours may bee inflamed
without putrefaction,<note place="margin">Feavers without putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</note> and cauſe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Feaver, which hath but one fit,

and from the matter, <hi>viz.</hi> (the fervid
bloud hurting our actions) whether it
be homotonous, epacmaſtical, or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racmaſtical;
and theſe four times may
be diſtinguiſhed though ſhort, and the
matter not moveable from place to
place. Next, let us examine the Sings
by which the Four times of Feavers
which ariſe from the Humours equally
putrefied, whoſe matter is quiet and
immoveable may be diſtinguiſhed, and
afterwards of thoſe inequally putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;
we will ſpeak firſt of thoſe whoſe
matter putrefies in the great Veines,
and if equally there ſhall ariſe a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
continual Feaver, which come not
alike to the integrity or interval, and
end with one fit, and has no periods,
yet hath its four times diſtinguiſhable;
The firſt is, when through the whole
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55454:29"/>
courſe of the Diſeaſe, the meaſure of
putrefaction is alike, and the Greeks
call this Homotonos; the ſecond is,
when the putrefaction is greater than
the diſſipation, and this is called E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacmaſtical;
the third is, when the
diſſipation is greater than the putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and is called Paracmaſtical, and
their four times are diſtinguiſht by their
intention, and remiſſion, and putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction;
if the Humours which are
contained in the great Veines doe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equally
putrefie, it is either the thinner
part of the bloud, or cholerick bloud
which putrefies, and it cauſes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
tertian, or flegme, or the cruder
part of the bloud, and cauſes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
quotidian, or the craſſer part,
of the bloud, and maketh a continual
quartan, of which more at large in
their proper places; the times of theſe
Feavers may be diſtinguiſht from what
is aforeſaid, if the Humours putrefie
out of thoſe greater Veines, the Feavers
ſhall bee intermitting, and their four
times ſhall be more evident than thoſe
of continual, becauſe the matter moves
from place to place, and they are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated

or looſeneſs.</p>

in the declination of a Paroxyſme, or
fit, the morbificall matter may not be
overcome, and ſo death may follow,
either from the weakneſs of the faculty,

from the quantity of the Humour
wherewith Nature is overwhelmed, or
by ſome errour of the Phiſician, though
ſignes of coction doe appear; to prove
this, <hi>Avicen</hi> in Book 4. fen. 2. tract 1.

either from the Diſeaſe, or from
its Efficient cauſe, or from the nature
and ſituation of the affected part, or
from the Symptomes; from the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
as a Feaver, whoſe preternatural
heat is in the Spirits, Humours, or ſolid
parts, and is not ſimple, but conjugate,
<hi>viz.</hi> hot and dry, which according
to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> axiome, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that is,
things are cured by their contraries;
that is, by coolers, and moiſtners, and
this is the firſt Canon. The ſecond is
taken from the morbifical putrid mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which requires an ablation, or
removing. The third from the nature
and ſite of the affected part, as if the
braine be affected, it requires other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55454:31"/>
than the Lungs, and this other
than the Stomack, Liver, Spleen, Guts,
Reines, Bladder, or Wombe, from the
Symptomes, if they be great with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
danger of life, as if a Syncope
be accidental to a Feaver, we muſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that, omitting for a while the
cure of the Feaver; but if they bee
ſmall, we muſt reſpect both, ſo that
we principally attend the Diſeaſe. The
feaveriſh beat both of continual and
intermitting Feavers ariſing from a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid
filth, cannot ſafely and wholly be
extinguiſht, before the putrefaction be
repreſſed, and the impurity taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
for the method of curing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
this, <hi>that first wee remove the
cauſe, then the effect, unleſſe ſomething
more urgent forbid it;</hi> the impure Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
then is firſt to bee purged forth,
and then if any extraneous heat be left,
either in the Humours, or parts, it is
to be extinguiſhed, and by prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
and things opening obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to be removed; but againſt this
Doctrine it is objected, <hi>That things
cooling doe</hi> per ſe <hi>encreaſe obſtructions,
incraſſate the matter, and hinder its eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation,
and the ſtipation being increaſed,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55454:32"/>
and the fuliginous vapours included, the
putrefaction is doubled.</hi> On the other
ſide, <hi>aperient, detergent, and purging
Medicines are all almoſt hot, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
per ſe <hi>are bad, and intend the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;</hi>
In this difficult caſe we muſt uſe
the temperate Rootes, ſuch as are the
ſharp Dock, Graſſe roots, Butchers
Broom, and Aſparagus, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
obſtructions without any manifeſt
heat, and doe not increaſe the feave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
diſtemper, and ſo the worſt is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
If the body bee ſtrong this
method is ſtrictly to be obſerved, that
is, to remove the efficient cauſe, and
thorowly to open the obſtructions
with the aforeſaid aperitive meanes,
and then the putrid humour is to bee
purged, although the Feaver be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
exaſperated by the Medicine that
does it; but when by the fire of the
Feaver the ſtrength is much reſolved,
then we are to uſe cooling Medicines
both inwardly and outwardly as Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leps,
Epithems, &amp;c. which with all
poſſible ſpeed may extinguiſh the heat,
omitting a while the cauſe, for it is
not ſafe to increaſe the Feaver by ſuch
things as cut off the cauſe, leſt life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55454:32"/>
with the Diſeaſe, but it is better
in my judgement to extinguiſh the
burning Feaver, though you ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
tranſgreſſe againſt the cauſe, but
in curing of putrid Feavers, the firſt
place is due to the cauſe, that part of
the matter be emptied, then to imitate
Nature by preparing it, which when
by her aſſiſtance it ſhall appear to bee
coct, then it poſſible to eradicate it,
that the Feaver be not diuturnal; the
emptying of the matter may be either
by bleeding, or purging at the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
if nothing hinder.</p>
               <p>Bleeding in all putrid Feavers,<note place="margin">Of Blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

his <hi>Method of curing,</hi> having premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
a cooling Gliſter, or Suppoſitory,
if the Patient were bound; nor in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting

or pulſative paine in the head,
or toſſing of the body with a ſuffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

Feaver, or the putrefaction
ſpread wider, and it is to bee done on
the intermitting day, or at the time of
remiſsion in a continual Feaver, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
age and ſtrength allow it; if the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55454:33"/>
Feaver be very vehement and urgent,
to let bloud in that violence is to kill
the Patient, ſaith <hi>Celſus;</hi> and if the
body be weak, let bloud a little at a
time, ſo the ſtrength will not bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired,
becauſe part of the burthen

taken off, ſhe doth the more eaſily bear
the reſt, and with leſſe force tame and
ſubdue it, ſaith <hi>Galen;</hi> and we ought
not ſo much to eſtimate the years as
the ſtrength of the diſeaſed.</p>
               <p>A late Writer hath publiſhed, that
<hi>Bleeding ought to be celebrated in all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,</hi>
which I cannot allow, though I
admit it in moſt, but more ſparingly
when the Feaver is from a cold hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
leſt by its refrigeration the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
be doubled, and doe not eaſily
admit of concoction, if the Diſeaſe
will ſuffer it, the beſt time for bleeding
is the Spring, if not, it may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred
at any time of the year, if

               <p>If the Sick be bound in body, before

that which is concoct, and not the
crude matter, nor at the beginning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
it be turgid, and for the moſt part
it is not, and afterwards to purge with
a ſtronger Medicine, unleſs it be done
by the benefit of Nature; neither are
we always to wait for the concoction
of the Humours, eſpecially where the

motion running from place to
place perturbes the whole body, as it
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55454:34"/>
happens in the moſt acute Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>If the Feaver be continual it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to purge at the time of remiſſion,
whethe it be in the morning or eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
than at the time of its exacerba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or upon an odde or decretory
day, if ſtrength give leave, otherwiſe
they are firſt to be refreſhed with nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhments
of good juyce, and thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
liquid than ſolid, becauſe thoſe
are of eaſier diſtribution, and then wee
are to uſe meanly purgers appropriate
to the humour; but if the Feaver bee
intermitting, then purge on the day of
reſt, or upon the fit day, if the fit
come not till after Dinner, at which
time the humour is moved by Nature
to expulſion, the ſtrength having firſt
been repaired by nouriſhments, for
then it is eaſier, and with leſs pains
driven forth, being in motion, as I
have found by experience in curing of
Quartans, as oft as I gave Phiſick on
the fit day; beſides, it may be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by reaſon, for that purging bee
inſtituted according to Art, we muſt
conſider the motion of Nature, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55454:34"/>
and the ſeaſon of the year, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. that is,
when we would purge a Body, we muſt
make it fluxil, that the humour to bee
emptied may yeeld, and be obedient
to the traction of the medicament, for
if the paſſages be obſtructed, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55454:35"/>
cauſed for want of ventilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then before we purge wee are to
uſe inciſive Medicines for the craſſe
humours, detergent for the clammy,
and ſo to clear the obſtructions; and
ſometimes we are to appeaſe and allay
ſome heady humour (which ought not
to have been purged) that by its furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
and fervor, it ruſh not on ſome
principal part, or by its acrimony ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulcerate
where it paſſes.</p>
               <p>The manner then of preparation, is
to be proportioned to the humour, for
the mitigation of the Diſeaſe; as for
example, in acute Feavers we uſe Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rups
and Apozems, which are made of
ſuch things as are attenuating and coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
or which are deterſive, and not
very hot, as you may ſee in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
part of my <hi>Enchiridion,</hi> but in
diuturnal ſlow Feavers, which flegme
or melancholly ingenders, ſtronger
and hotter means are required; and
thoſe fierce humours which bleeding
will not temper, nor purging carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
we muſt bridle, and obtund
with refrigerating Medicines, not of
thin ſubſtance leſt they be more exagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated,
nor of craſſe becauſe they hinder
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55454:35"/>
evacuation, but of a middle nature,
which have a little auſterity, or acid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
or both joyned with them, ſuch
as are your Omphacium, juyce of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
Pomgranate, or Citron, by which
the acrimony and putrefaction of cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
may be retunded, and the heat kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the humours, be impeded from
ſpreading any further. If beſides the
putrefaction there ſhall be any ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of venenoſity, we muſt mixe with the
former ſuch things as by a ſimilitude
of ſubſtance doe repreſſe it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inwardly or outwardly applied,
which ſhall be deſcribed in our <hi>Tract of
malignant and peſtilent Feavers;</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and attenuating Medicines are to
be fitted both for preparation of hot
and cold Humours, becauſe both Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
by their clammineſs, or craſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
may obſtruct, as is manifeſt in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellinous
choler; if a deterſive, and
attenuatory faculty bee joyned with
a cold quality, as in Succory, it is the
more efficacious, and of more frequent
uſe than that joyned with a hot qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
as in Worm-wood, Hyſſope, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riganum,
and that is to be uſed in hot
Diſeaſes, theſe in cold with mulſe, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55454:36"/>
not with plaine water, eſpecially when
the heat is ſluggiſh, and the means not
eaſily inflamed; but on the other ſide,
with cooling Medicines we at once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
both the fervor of choler, and
heat of the Feaver, and prepare the
vitious humour which doth foment it
before we purge, by a diverſe quality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as more at large in the Second part of
our <hi>Enchiridion.</hi> There are ſome that
ſtoutly maintaine the opinon of <hi>Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen,
That thin cholerick humours ought
to be incraſſated before they be purged;</hi>
which opinion ſeems to contradict
<hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> and may thus
be reconciled. If ſincere, or excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious
choler be thin, it is not to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſſated
before purging, but preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be caſt forth, for ſo it eaſily yeelds
to the attraction of the Medicine, and
thus the opinion of the Greeks is true;
but if the ſame choler be craſſe and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious,
as the vitellinous is, then it is
to be attenuated and deterged, as <hi>Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen</hi>
would have it, otherwiſe it cannot
be driven forth, but by force and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
to the Patient; but if it be mixt
with bloud, then wee are to expect
concoction from the benefit of Nature,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55454:36"/>
but the Fautorers of <hi>Avicen</hi> object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the opinion of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> That
<hi>unleſſe the thin humours be incraſſated,
they will be fixt in our members, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating
into the moſt retired parts of our
bodies;</hi> to which objection ſome anſwer,
If the choler be infixt it will grow
thick, and cauſe obſtructions, and
then extenuating and detergent, and
not incraſſating Medicines are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or by attenuating remedies Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is helped to excerne the noxious
humour by urine or ſweat; neither
doth the ſtrength of this Argument
reach to preparation before purging;
ſhall that which is craſſe then be atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated,
and that which is tenuous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſſated?
<hi>Galens</hi> opinion is, that
<hi>That which may return to its natural
ſtate be altered, as by incraſſating the
thin</hi> (viz. <hi>in Diſeaſes of the Breaſt) and
attenuating the craſſe, but not ſo in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
or alteration before purging;</hi>
and by this diſtinction the <hi>Greeks</hi> and
<hi>Avicen</hi> may bee made friends. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
give other Reaſons againſt <hi>Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen</hi>
thus, The firſt Natural action is
Attraction, to which thin Humours
are moſt obedient, and moſt readily
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55454:37"/>
follow the medicament; the ſecond is
a kind of violent expulſion, by which
alſo thin Humours are moſt eaſily dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
forth, therefore they are not to be
incraſſated.</p>
               <p>There are three ſorts of purging
Medicines, ſome purge by Traction,
ſuch as <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and the ancient
<hi>Greeks</hi> uſed, as Euphorbium, Lathiris,
Elaterium, Scammonium, Colocyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>this,
Helleborus, &amp;c. which wee uſe
not now, unleſs in great Diſeaſes, or
in ſmall quantity mixt with other
things, and corrected, and on ruſtick
bodies, whom gentler Medicines will
little or nothing move, and not in
continual Feavers ſprung from a hot
cauſe.</p>
               <p>Others purge by ſmoothing, or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling,
as Manna Cal. Caſsia Egypt,
Sena, Polypody, Sirrup of Violets, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Others purge with aſtriction, as
Rhubarb, all the Myrobalans, juyce
and Sirrup of Roſes, which we uſe
when the parts are to be ſtrengthened,
and there is no obſtruction which they
may prejudice; he that is to take a
Purge in them morne, let him not take
Sirrop of Poppies over night, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55454:37"/>
Treacle, or new Mithridate in
it, becauſe the cold quality they have

The cauſe of a not exquiſite conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
tertian is the mixture of ſalt
flegme,<note place="margin">The cauſes of a not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite continual Tertian.</note> or ichors, putrefying in the

               <p>The ſignes of an exquiſite tertian
have great analogy with thoſe of an

putrefied out of the great Veines in

exquiſite, when Natural melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly

their matter putrefies not every

body; an intermitting Tertian is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,
exquiſite or ſpurious, the exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
is from excrementitious choller,
which being manifold, there are many
differences in Tertians.</p>
               <p>The matter of an exquiſite tertian
offends either in quantity or quality;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55454:58"/>
the quantity is either great or ſmall, if
great, either it putrefies in one place,
or in divers at once; if but in one place,
it cauſes an exquiſite tertian, which
exceeds not ſeven Fits; but if the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
be ſmall, it ſhall end the fourth or
fifth fit.</p>
               <p>If the matter offend in quality, as
the choller is more or leſs hot, the
whole conſtitution of the Diſeaſe and
the fits ſhall bee longer or ſhorter,
milder, or more tedious, for pale or
excrementitious choller is ſarre more
milde then yellow, and this, then vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellinous,
porracious, or aeruginous, but
the ceruleous is the hotteſt of all.</p>
               <p>If choller putrefie in divers places
together,<note place="margin">Whence a double Tertian.</note> and the ſame day, then is
cauſed a double intermitting tertian,
whoſe fits returne every third day, and
are exacerbated, although they aſſault
every day, and intermit, becauſe that
which is putrefied is every fit emptied
either by ſweat, vomit, or ſtool. The

from excrementitious choller only,

wines, hot liver, and temper, &amp;c. The
cauſes of a ſpurious one are idleneſs,
effeminacy, winter ſeaſon, cold and
moyſt diet, obſtructions, plenitude,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>The heat of an exquiſite Tertian is
more acrid and mordent than that of
the ſpurious,<note place="margin">The Signs</note> through its four times, it
begins with rigour, and often with
cholerick vomitings, and ends with an
univerſal ſweat; when the rigour is off,
the heat is like a light fire, burning
with difficult breathing, the urine at
firſt is ſomewhat red, of meane ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and in the lower part ſeemes
thin, in the upper opacus.</p>
               <p>The ſignes of a ſpurious one are hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
from the mixture of choller and
flegme, a heat more obſcure than that
of the exquiſite Tertian, and more

theſe two humours mixt doe putrefie
in the ſame place, beginning and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

mixtion they cannot be known diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or apart, becauſe their ſignes are
confounded, from whence this Feaver
hath its name; likewiſe if both thoſe
humours putrefie in the leſſer veines
which are in the habit of the body, or
in the Stomach, Liver, Meſentery,
Spleen, or Cuts, together in the ſame
place, there ſhall be two intermitting

the confuſed) but in divers places to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
whether in the greater or leſſer
veines; and this Feaver hath its name
from the predominant humour, as in a
baſtard Tertian where choller predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates;
likewiſe if there be more

then be called a baſtard quotidian, or

The Erratick Feaver is ſo called,<note place="margin">Of the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratick Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
its fits obſerve no proportion, for
their beginnings are inordinate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
no ſpecies of any certaine ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

Feaver then is of no certaine ſpecies, for
it is neither quotidian, tertian, nor
quartan, nor much leſs a continual, for
being ſo called from the uncertaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
of the fits, it is plaine it cannot bee
continual, though it may bee joyned
with a continual, as well as other inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
Feavers; an erratick then is
from no certaine kind of humour as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
intermittings are, but either from
the humours confounded together, and
unequally premixt, and putrefying in
the habit of the body, or from one hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
but changed from it ſelf and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
into another, for how much the
humours are changed in the body of
the ſick, ſo much are the circuits of the
fits varied; and bloud is moſt of all
tranſmuted when it putrefies, part of it
paſſing into yellow choller, part into
black.</p>
               <p>The cauſes of theſe Feavers are
many,<note place="margin">The Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> one is the inequality of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55454:72"/>
humour begins to putrefie in a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
part, and another flowes to it from
other parts, which was before bounded
in them, or was redundant in the
whole body; a third is errour in diet,
quantity, or quality of the humour,
ſtrength of the Patient, &amp;c. they are
long, and of evil judgement; he that
would diſtinguiſh them rightly muſt
bee well verſed in the knowledge of
ſimple Feavers, both continual and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting.</p>
               <p>The ſignes of Compound Feavers
differ not from thoſe of the ſimple in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting,
as a double intermitting
tertian begins as a ſimple with rigour,
and ſometimes with vomiting, and
ends with ſweat; Compound Feavers
are ſeldome of divers intermittings, but
if it happen the firſt dayes, they are
ſcarce diſcernable.</p>
               <p>Compound Quartans begin with
horrour, as the ſimple intermittings,
and they are the longeſt of all, they
are thus diſtinguiſht; a double quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
growes furious two dayes, and is
quiet the third, the fourth, and fifth;
again is furious, and ſo conſequently a
triple quartan every day begins with
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55454:73"/>
horrour, but every fourth day the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is more grievous, as if it were a
ſimple quartan.</p>
               <p>Every intermitting Feaver of divers
kinde may be complicate with another
of the ſame kinde, if it be in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as if a quotidian bee mixt with a
tertian, on one day there ſhall be two
fits, but on the next only one, that of
the quotidian; and on the third day
there ſhall be two, on the fourth but
one, and ſo forwards, the one ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with coldneſs, the other with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour.</p>
               <p>If a quotidian be mixt with a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
then the fourth day there ſhall bee
two fits, one with coldneſs, the other
with horrour, on the other dayes but
one, that of the quotidian. If a tertian
and quartan concur, the firſt inſult
ſhall be of the tertian with rigour, the
ſecond day there ſhall be no Feaver, the
third day the tertian ſhall recur, on the
fourth a fit of the quartan, on the fifth
another of the tertian, on the ſixth
none, on the ſeventh there ſhall bee a
double fit, one of the tertian, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the quartan, and ſo on. If a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid
Feaver be joyned with a Hectick
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:55454:73"/>
it makes a compound, becauſe the heat
of this poſſeſſes the ſubſtance of the
heart, that, the humours.</p>
               <p>The ſignes of both are taken from the

be every third day, if a quartan, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fourth, if a quotidian, every day,

which firſt ſeazes on the ſubſtance of the

this is ſeldome; a particular one is

that which firſt invades the ſubſtance
of ſome private part, and at laſt the
heart; and this is frequent, as of the
Lungs in a Ptiſſick, of the Midriffe,

which hath a putrid Feaver joyned

when the body of the heart, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

and this degree laſts as long as the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantifical
and radical moyſture doth
conglutinate the terrene parts, and is
ſufficient to nouriſh and foment the
fiery heat, as Oyle doth the flame of

to be known, but eaſie to be cured.</p>

                  </gap>, becauſe it hath adjoyned
a hot and dry Conſumption, and is
then when the humour is wholly wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
and all the ſolid parts are as it
were burnt, and turned into aſhes, as
the Cotton of the Lamp is for want of
the affuſion of more Oyle, for thus the
ſubſtantifical moyſture being quite
ſpent, the native heat is extinguiſhed,
and cannot bee reſtaurated by <hi>Euchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi>

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:55454:77"/>
cannot be hid, ſo it cannot bee cured.
