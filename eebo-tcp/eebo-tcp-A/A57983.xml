            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>AMong the Servants of the Court was one
<hi>David Rizzi</hi> born at <hi>Turin:</hi> His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was an honest Man, but so very
poor, that all he could do was to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
himself and his Family, by teaching the Elements
of Musick. Having nothing to leave to his Children,
he taught them, both Sons and Daughters, to sing.
Of these, <hi>David</hi> being young and brisk, and trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Voice that was not disagreable, and to his
Skill in Musick which he had learned from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he resolved to try his Fortune; and in order to
this went to <hi>Nice,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who
had lately been restored to his Dominions, kept his
Court. But Matters there not answering his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
he came to be in such extream want, that
he knew not well what to do with himself, when be
hapned to fall in with Signior <hi>Moretti,</hi> who was then
(as the Duke's Envoy) preparing for his Iourney to
<hi>Scotland,</hi> he waited on him thither. But being there,
<hi>Moretti</hi> having but a small Allowance for himself, and
no great need of his Service, dismissed him; however
<hi>David</hi> resolved to make some stay, and try his Fortune
again: he was chiefly encouraged to this, being told
that the Queen delighted in hearing of Songs, and
was not altogether unskilful in Musick. To make his
way to her, he made an Interest with the Musicians


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34139:3"/>
(who were for the most part French) that he might
appear amongst them. Thus being heard to sing
once or twice, she liked him so well, that he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
added to their Number.</p>
               <p>Having got into this Post, and observed the
Queen's humour and way, he, partly by flattering
her, partly by carrying Stories to her of the other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
came in a little time to be as much in her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
as he was hated by the rest of the Family. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
all this good Fortune could not satisfy him; but
having either lessened with the Queen such as seemed
to be on the same foot of Favour with himself, or got
them turned out of the Family by his false Suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he began insensibly to aspire to meddle in greater
Matters; till at last he was employed to write her
Letters, and then he had a fair pretext to be with
the Queen alone, which afforded him opportunities of
doing business with her under-hand.</p>
               <p>All this could not but make a great noise, to see a
Man who was little better than a Beggar, raised on
the sudden to great Riches; a Man whose Fortune
did far exceed his Merit, and yet his arrogance in
despising his Equals, and vying with his Superiors,
surpassed even his Fortune. It was the meanness of
a great many of the Nobility that served chiefly to
encourage this Fellow in his extravagant Vanity:
they slavishly made their court to him, cringing to
him upon all occasions, admiring and applauding
whatever he said; waiting at his Apartment, and
presenting themselves in his way when he went in or
out; Only the Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> one that could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
dissemble, instead of making his court to him,
shewed even by his Countenance, for the most part,
the contempt he had of him. Which behaviour of
the Earl's offended the Queen her self no less than it
did <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:34139:3"/>
He on the other hand, to have a support against the
hatred of the chief of the Nobility, courted with all the
arts of flattery and insinuation, <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Darley,</hi>
who was to marry the Queen; and got into that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of familiarity with him, that <hi>Darley</hi> made him
his Companion and Bedfellow, and entirely trusted
him. He perswaded the unwary Young Man, who
was forward to believe whatever suted his Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that it was by his means chiefly that the Queen
had been induced to cast her Eyes upon him. He was
also daily sowing Discord betwixt <hi>Darley</hi> and the
Earl of <hi>Murray;</hi> for he flattered himself, that if
he could once get rid of that Earl, he might for the
rest of his Life take his full career without opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>By this time the Queen's intended Marriage with
<hi>Darley,</hi> and his private meetings with her; as also
her strange familiarity with <hi>David,</hi> were much talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of and censured every where. Vpon which the
Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> finding there was nothing to be
done, and that the good Advice he gave served only
to irritate his Sister against him, resolved to leave
the Court, lest he should seem to have any hand in
what was doing.</p>

                  </note> so
incensed the Queen against her Brother, as
to quicken her to put in execution the Design
she had premeditated against his Life. The manner
was agreed to be thus: That the Queen who was then
at <hi>Perth</hi> with little Company, should send for the
Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> thither, where the Lord <hi>Darley</hi>
should enter into discourse with him; and as it was
not doubted the Earl would speak plainly and freely,
the Dispute by that means growing warm, <hi>David


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34139:4"/>
Rizzi</hi> should give him the first Wound, and then
the rest-should dispatch him upon the place. Of this
Conspiracy the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> was informed by his
Friends who were in the Court; yet being resolved to
go, he set forward on his Iourney, but
receiving a second admonition from<note n="*" place="margin">Author of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Relation.</note> 
                  <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick</hi>
Lord <hi>Ruthen,</hi> he turned out of
the way, and went to visit his Mother
at her House, which stands situated on the Lake of
<hi>Leven.</hi>

            </q>
            <q>
               <bibl>Fol. 208.</bibl>
               <p>There was also another reason which prevailed not
a little with the Queen to use expedition in
this matter <hi>(of her Marriage)</hi> she knew
her<note n="†" place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain.</hi>
                  </note> Vncles were averse to the Match,
and feared, if any longer delay should
intervene, that some Obstruction might
be laid in the way by them, which might disturb the
whole Business. For when that secret Resolution was
taken, of making a Holy War throughout all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
for extirpating the pure Doctrine of the Gospel,
the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> who was designed for Commander
in chief of all those Forces, having conceived the
most unwarrantable and immoderate hopes, resolved
by the means of his Niece, to embroil <hi>Britain</hi> in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick
Troubles, that they might not be able to send
the least assistance to their Friends abroad. But <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
who was in great credit with the Queen, insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the intended Marriage would be advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to Religion, on account that <hi>Henry</hi> and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were most strenuous assertors of the Papal Sect,
agreable to both Nations, allied to divers Noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
and supported by many Friends, the thing in
dispute was at last forced that way. Notwithstanding
all which, two things seemed to cross <hi>David</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34139:4"/>
if the Marriage should succeed with the consent
of the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and of the Nobility of
<hi>Scotland:</hi> the first, that he should lose the Honour of
being accounted the Author; the second, that provision
would be made for the Security of Religion: whereas
if the Queen would join her self with the Council of
<hi>Trent,</hi> he promised himself Honours, Benefices, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Treasures, and uncontrouled Authority. For
these reasons he left nothing unattempted to precipitate
the Marriage, and effected it; the <hi>Scots</hi> being not
well pleased, and the <hi>English</hi> most highly offended.</p>
            </q>
            <q>
               <bibl>Fol. 209.</bibl>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>David</hi> finding the Court cleared
of the principal Persons of the Nobility, that he
might confirm his intemperate hopes of Power, còn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
laboured by rash Advice to excite the Queen to
use the coercive Power of the Sword against the Heads
of the several Parties, assuring her that if a few were
removed, the rest would not dare to attempt any thing:
But conjecturing that the Queen's Guards, being <hi>Scots<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
would not easily consent to the Murder of the
Nobility, he made it his principal business to turn
them out from that Post, and to introduce Foreigners
(which has almost ever been the rise of all Tyranies)
into that Body. To that end a motion was first made
to send for <hi>Germans,</hi> that Nation being esteemed to
be of great fidelity to their Masters: but <hi>David</hi>
having attentively consider'd the matter, concluded it
to be more commodious for the carrying on of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
that <hi>Italians</hi> should be admitted to that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment;
being perswaded that Men of the same
Nation with himself would not only be more intirely
under his Power, but that having no tincture of any
Religion they would be also the most proper Instruments
of embroiling Affairs; and making no distinction


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34139:5"/>
between what is just and what unjust, might easily
be driven to perpetrate any kind of Villany: besides
which, men indigent and wicked, born and educated
under Tyrants, accustomed to unjust War, and who
being far from home esteemed nothing in <hi>Britain</hi> dear
to them, seemed most fit to support the Innovations
intended. To this end he began by degrees to send for
vagabond Souldiers from <hi>Flanders</hi> and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
upon the Continent, who came single, and at
different times, that what was doing might not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear:
but to offend one of these was more dangerous
than to offend the Queen. In the mean time, as the
Power and Authority of <hi>David</hi> with the Queen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
daily, so the King became daily more contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
to her; and to treat him yet with greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity,
<hi>David</hi> was substituted to sign divers pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Acts in the place of the King.</p>
            </q>
            <q>
               <bibl>Fol. 209.</bibl>
               <p>The Queen not contenting her self to have raised
<hi>David</hi> from the meanest obscurity, and exposed him
to the view of the People in this high degree of Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
contrived another way of honouring him in a
domestick and more familiar manner. She had for
some Months admitted more Persons than had been u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
at her Table, that <hi>David</hi> might have a place
there with less envy, on account of the number of those
who received that honour; not doubting by this shew
of Popularity, the numerous company, and daily use,
the strangeness of the Spectacle would by degrees not
only wear off, but the Stomach of the stoutest be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly
accustomed to suffer any thing. At last
<hi>David</hi> with only one or two more was permitted to eat
with her; yet that the straitness of the Place might
in some measure diminish the Envy of the Action,
they sometimes eat in a little Closet, and sometimes


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34139:5"/>
in <hi>David</hi>'s Chamber. But instead of lessening the
Publick Envy by these means, they increased their own
Infamy, confirmed former Suspicions, and afforded
matter for sinister Discourses. Another thing fell
in also to inflame the minds of Men already disposed
to believe the worst, that <hi>David</hi> for surpassed the
King in rich Furniture, Cloths, number and goodness
of Horses; which Indignity seemed so much the
greater, by how much his Face contributed more to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the effect of every Ornament about him, than
any of those Advantages to grace his Person. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Queen, since she could not correct. the faults
of Nature, endeavours by heaping Honours upon him
to advance him into the highest Order of Men, that
the Meanness of his Birth and his personal Deformity
might lie concealed under the cover of a fortuitous No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility;
but most especially that by this means having a
right of voting in the publick Assemblies, he might be
enabled to manage those Councils as the Queen should
direct. And because it was thought necessary to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
gradually, and that he might not seem to be an
indigent and mercenary Senator, their first attempt
was made upon a Lordship, called by the Seots <hi>Malvil,</hi>
and situated near <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> The Possessor of the
Lordship, with his Father-in-law, and such Friends
as were thought to have the most influence upon him,
were sent for to the Queen, who endeavoured to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with the Lord to deliver up his Possession quietly,
and to induce his Father-in-law, with the rest of his
Friends, to perswade him so to do. But this way not
taking effect as was desired, the Queen interpreted
their refusal as an affront to her; and which was
more pernicious, <hi>David</hi> was highly offended. The
People (for these things were not done in the dark) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to deplore the present Evils, and to expect worse eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day; If men of the most antient Families and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour




<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34139:6"/>
might be expelled from the Seats of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
at the will of an indigent Rascal. The old
men called to mind, and frequently mentioned the
time when <hi>Cockeran,</hi> after the barbarous Murder of
the King's Brother, was advanced from a Porter to
the Earldom of <hi>Marr,</hi> and filled the whole Kingdom
with Fire and Sword; which Desolation terminated in
the Death of the King, and almost total S<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>bversion
of the Kingdom: To these things which were publick,
men in private Discourses added many more, as is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
in undecent and scandalous cases. But the
King resolving to credit nothing, save what he should
discover by himself, being informed that <hi>David</hi> was
gone into the Queen's Chamber, he went to the Door,
of which he always carried a Key; and contrary to
custom, finding it to be bolted within, he knocked; but
no one answering, he departed in a great rage; and
being agitated by most violent Passions, passed the
greater part of the Night without Sleep.</p>

               <p>About that time Letters were brought from the
Queen of <hi>England,</hi> in which many things concerning
the present state of Affairs in <hi>Scotland</hi> were kindly
and prudently treated, with a gentle and affectionate
admonition to her Kinswoman to lay aside her Passion,
and to entertain more moderate Counsels. The Queen
understanding that the Lords knew such Letters were
arrived, and that no one doubted the Contents, called
divers of them to her (hoping the favour would be
interpreted to proceed from inclination) and began
to read them in their presence. But as she was in the
course of her reading, <hi>David</hi> openly admonished her
that she had read enough, and commanded her to stop:
which Action was accounted by all to be rather insolent
than new; for they were not ignorant how arrogantly


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34139:6"/>
he used to carry himself to her, frequently reproving
her with more sharpness than her Husband durst ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
to do. Few days after this the Cause of the
Exiles was warmly debated in Parliament, where
some to gratify the Queen, moving they might be
punished as Traytors, and others affirming they had
done nothing which deserved so great Severity; <hi>David</hi>
in the mean time surrounded the Members one by one,
and endeavoured to penetrate the intention of each to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
those that were banished, if he should be chosen
President by the rest of the Assembly; not doubting
openly to discover that the Queen would have them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd;
and that whoever should oppose her, would
not only take pains to no purpose, but incur her High
Displeasure.</p>

RELATION
Of the Death of
DAVID RIZZI,
Chief Favorite to MARY
Queen of Scots, &amp;c.</head>
            <byline>Written by the Lord RUTHEN.</byline>
            <p>IN the first, the Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> a
Man of forty and six Years, was visited by
the Hand of God with great trouble and
sickness, having two Infirmities, the one
called <hi>the Inflammation of the Liver,</hi> and the other
<hi>the Consumption of the Reins and Kidneys,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>through
he kept his Bed continually by the space
of three months, and was under the cure of
Physicians, as of the Queen's French Doctor, Dr.
<hi>Preston,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Thompson</hi> Apothecary; and
was so feebled and weakned through the Sickness
and Medicines, that scarcely he might walk twice
the length of his Chamber unsitting down. In
this mean time the King, Husband to the Queen's
Majesty of <hi>Scotland,</hi> conceived hatred against an
Italian called <hi>David Riccio;</hi> and about the <hi>10th</hi>
day of <hi>February</hi> the said King sent his dear Friend
and Kinsman <hi>George Douglas</hi> Son to <hi>Archibald,</hi>


               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:34139:8"/>
sometime Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> and declared to the
said Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> how that the said <hi>David Riccio</hi>
had abused him in many sorts, and lately had
staied the Queen's Majesty from giving him the
Crown Matrimonial of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
had promised to him divers times before:
Besides many other Wrongs that the said <hi>David</hi>
had done to him, which he could not bear with
longer, and behoved to be revenged thereof.
And because the said Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> was one of
the Nobility that he confided and trusted most
unto, in respect that his Children and he were
Sisters Children; therefore he desired his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
and Advice what way was best to be revenged
on the said <hi>David.</hi> The said Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Message aforesaid, gave answer to <hi>George
Douglass,</hi> that he could give no counsel in that
Matter, in respect he knew the King's Youth and
Facility; for he had sundry of the Nobility that
had given him counsel for his own Honour and
Weal, and immediately he revealed the same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to the Queen's Majesty, who reproved them
with great anger and contumelious words: So
the said Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> would have no medling
with his Proceedings until the time he could
keep his own counsel. The said <hi>George</hi> departed
with the said Lord's Answer to the King about
the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>February:</hi> The said King hearing
the Answer, was very miscontented, and said, It
is a sore case that I can get none of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
that will assist me against yonder false Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain
<hi>Davie.</hi> The said <hi>George</hi> answered, The
said Fault was in your self, that cannot keep
your own counsel. Then the King took a Book
and swore thereon, that what Counsel soever
the Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> should give him, he would not


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34139:8"/>
reveal, neither to the Queen's Majesty, nor to
any others; and immediately directed the said
<hi>George</hi> to the said Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> again, declaring
what Oath the King had made. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the said Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> was eight days there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
e're he would give any counsel therein;
howbeit the said King sent the said <hi>George</hi> to him
every day three or four times. After eight
days were past, the which was toward the <hi>20th</hi>
day of <hi>February,</hi> the said Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the King's whole Intent was but only the
slaughter of <hi>Davie,</hi> the said Lord resolved in
his mind, and considered that he had a good time
to labour for certain of the Nobility his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
that were banished in the Realm of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and in <hi>Argile;</hi> and specially the Earls of
<hi>Argile, Murray, Glencarn</hi> and <hi>Rothes;</hi> the Lord
<hi>Boyd</hi> and <hi>Ocheltrie,</hi> and Lairds of <hi>Pittarro</hi> and
<hi>Grange,</hi> with many other Gentlemen and Barons.
Wherefore so soon as the said <hi>George</hi> was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
again from the King to him, the said
Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> answered, That he could not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with the King's Affairs, without that he
would bring home the Noblemen before rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
who were banished only for the Word of
God. And after long reasoning, and divers
days travelling, the King was contented that
they should come home into the Realm of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
so that the said Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> would make
him sure that they would be his, and set forward
all his Affairs. The said Lord gave answer to
the King, and bad him make his own Security,
and that he should cause it to be subscribed by
the aforesaid Earls, Lords, and Barons. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
thereafter the King directed the said
<hi>George Douglass</hi> to the said Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34139:9"/>
Articles, which he desired the said Lord to
put in form of Writing, to be subscribed by the
Lords banished; the which the said Lord caused
to be put in form. And having consideration
that the said King desir'd them to be bound to
him, the said Lord caused to be drawn certain
Articles in the said Lords Names for the King's
part towards them; which the King himself re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
with his own hand in the Margent, like
as it is to be produced.</p>
            <p>The Articles being penned for both Parties,
and the King reading and considering the same,
he was contented therewith, and subscribed his
part, and delivered it to the said Lord <hi>Ruthen,</hi>
who sent the other Articles to the Earl of <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray,</hi>
and the remanent being within <hi>England;</hi>
and to the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> and the remanent being
with him in the West, who subscribed the same,
and sent them to the said Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> to be kept
till their meeting with the King, and every one
to have their own part: The Tenour whereof

            <p>All this while the King kept secret from the
Queen's Majesty the whole Proceedings; and as
her Majesty sought by subtil means to learn of
him what was in his mind, so crafted he with
her to seek out her mind: And in the same time
he daily sent to the Lord <hi>Ruthen,</hi> saying that he
could not abide <hi>Davie</hi> any longer; and if his
Slaughter was not hastned, he would slay him
himself, yea, tho it were in the Queen's Majesty's
own Chamber. The said Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> counselled
him to the contrary, and thought it not decent
that he should put hand on such a mean Person:
yet always the King could not be content, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the said Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> affixed a day when the
said <hi>Davie</hi> should be slain. The said Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
with himself that it was not convenient
nor honourable to slay the said <hi>Davie,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Offences he had made; but rather
to take him, and give him Judgment by the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
the King's Majesty answered, it was cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bersome
to tarry in such a Cause; but always he
could be contented that he were taken and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or dispatched otherwise. In the mean time
the King and Queen's Majesties rode to <hi>Seaton;</hi>
the King so burning in his desire towards the


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34139:12"/>
Slaughter of <hi>David,</hi> he sent divers privy Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
written in his own hand, and also Messages
by tongue to <hi>George Douglas,</hi> to be shewed to the
Lord <hi>Ruthen,</hi> to have all things in readiness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his repairing to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> towards the
Slaughter of <hi>David,</hi> or otherwise he would put
the same in execution with his own hands. In
the mean time the said Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> was practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
with the Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> who was the King's
near Kinsman, and with the Lord <hi>Lindsey,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his Wife was a <hi>Douglas,</hi> and of consan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity
to the King; and with a great number of
Barons, Gentlemen, and Freeholders, to assist
the King in such Affairs as he had to do; and then
they should have their Religion freely established
conform to Christ's Book, and to the Articles that
the King had subscribed to the Lords. And after
the King's return out of <hi>Seaton,</hi> he directed
<hi>George Douglas</hi> to the said Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> and
Lord <hi>Ruthen,</hi> to see what day should be appointed,
with place and time, for the performance of the
Enterprise against <hi>David.</hi> The said Earl and Lord
sent answer to the King, and declared they should
have a sufficient number ready against Friday or
Saturday the <hi>8th</hi> or <hi>9th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> to do what he
pleased; and enquired of the King what time
he would have it the ratherest performed; for
according to the said Earl's and Lord's opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they thought it best to take time when <hi>David</hi>
should be in his own Chamber in the Morning, or
in passing through the Close: which the King refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>simpliciter,</hi> and said he could not be well taken
in his own Chamber, nor no time in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
by reason that at night he tarried late with
the Queen's Majesty; he lay in the over Cabinet,
and otherwhiles in <hi>Signior Francisco</hi>'s Chamber, and


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34139:13"/>
sometimes in his own, to which he had sundry
Backdoors and Windows that he might escape at;
and if so it were, all were lost. Therefore he
would have him taken at the time of the supping,
sitting with her Majesty at the Table, that he
might be taken in her own presence; because
she had not entertained him her Husband accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to her accustomed manner, nor as she ought of
Duty. To the which the said Earl and Lords
were very loth to grant, and gave many reasons
to the contrary, that it was better to have been
done out of her presence, not in the same. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
no reason might avail, but the
King would have him taken in her Majesty's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
and devised the manner himself, as after
followeth: That upon the Saturday at Supper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
the said Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> Lord <hi>Ruthen,</hi> and
Lord <hi>Lindsey,</hi> should have ready so many as would
be Assistants and Partakers with the King, in
their Houses, against he should send them word:
and so soon as he sent them word, that the Earl of
<hi>Morton</hi> should come in, and come up to the
Queen's utter Chamber, and a Company with
him; and the said Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> to come through
the King's secret Chamber; and that the King
would pass up before by a privy Passage to the
Queen's Chamber, and open the Door, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>through
the said Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> and his Company
might enter: and that the King himself should
be speaking with the Queen's Majesty sitting at
supper; the remanent Barons and Gentlemen to
be in the Court of the Palace for keeping of the
Gates, and defending of the Close, in case any
of the Lords or Officers would endeavour to
gain-stand the King's Enterprize. The said Earl
of <hi>Morton</hi> and Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> having consideration


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34139:13"/>
of the King's Devise towards the taking of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie</hi>
in the Queen's Majesty's Chamber, were loth
to grant thereto; yet the King would not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
but have it done as he had devised. The
said Earl and Lords considering he was a young
Prince, and having a lusty Princess to lie in his
Arms afterwards, who might perswade him to
deny all that was done for his Cause, and to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
that others perswaded him to the same,
thought it necessary to have security thereupon;
and a Band was made in the King's name to the
Earls, Lords, Barons, Freeholders, Merchants,
and Craftsmen, declaring all that was to be done
was his own Devise, Invention, and Fact; and
bound and obliged himself, his Heirs and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
to them, their Heirs and Successors,
to keep them skeithless, and unmolested or
troubled for the taking and executing of <hi>Davie</hi>
in the Queen's presence or otherwise, like as the
Band more at large specified hereafter word by
word.</p>
            <p>Be it kend to all men by these present Letters:
We <hi>Henry</hi> by the Grace of God, King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and Husband to the Queen's Majesty; for
so much we having consideration of the gentle
and good nature, with many other good Qualities
in her Majesty, we have thought pity, and also
think it great conscience to us that are her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
to suffer her to be abused or seduced by
certain privy Persons, wicked and ungodly, not
regarding her Majesty's Honour, Ours, nor the
Nobility thereof, nor the Common-weal of the
same, but seeking their own Commodity and
privy Gains, especially a Stranger <hi>Italian</hi> called
<hi>Davie:</hi> which may be the occasion of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34139:14"/>
Destruction, Ours, the Nobility, and
Commonweal, without hasty remedy be put
thereto, which we are willing to do: and to
that effect we have devised to take these privy
Persons, Enemies to her Majesty, Us, the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and Commonwealth, to punish them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Demerits; and in case of any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
to cut them off immediately, and to take
and slay them wherever it happeneth. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we cannot accomplish the same without the
assistance of others, therefore have we drawn
certain of our Nobility, Earls, Lords, Barons,
Freeholders, Gentlemen, Merchants, and Crafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
to assist us in our Enterprise, which cannot
be finished without great hazard. And because it
may chance that there be sundry great Personages
present, who may endeavour to gain-stand our
Enterprise, where-through some of them may
be slain, and likewise of ours, where-through a
perpetual Feud may be contracted betwixt the
one and the other; therefore we bind and oblige
Us, our Heirs, and Successors, to the said Earls,
Lords, Barons, Gentlemen, Freeholders, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
and Craftsmen, their Heirs and Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
that we shall accept the same Feud upon Us,
and fortify and maintain them at the uttermost of
our Power, and shall be Friend to their Friends,
and Enemy to their Enemies; and shall neither
suffer them nor theirs to be molested nor troubled
in their Bodies, Lands, Goods, nor Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
so far as lieth in us. And if any person
would take any of the said Earls, Lords, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,
Gentlemen, Freeholders, Merchants, or
Craftsmen, for enterprizing and assisting with
us for the atchieving of our purpose, because it
may chance to be done in presence of the Queen's


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:34139:14"/>
Majesty, or within her Palace of <hi>Holyrood-house,</hi>
we by the Word of a Prince shall accept and take
the same on us now as then, and then as now;
and shall warrant and keep harmless the foresaid
Earls, Lords, Barons, Freeholders, Gentlemen,
Merchants and Craftsmen, at our utter power. In
witness whereof we have subscribed this with our
own hand at <hi>Edinburg,</hi> the <hi>1st</hi> of <hi>March</hi> 1565.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Saturday</hi> the <hi>9th</hi> day of <hi>March,</hi> as is
conform to the King's Ordenance and Device,
the said Earl <hi>Morton,</hi> Lords <hi>Ruthen</hi> and <hi>Lindsey,</hi>
having their Men and Friends in readiness, abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the King's Advertisement; the King hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
supped, and the sooner for that Cause, and
the Queen's Majesty being in her Cabinet within
her inner Chamber at the Supper, the King sent
to the said Earl and Lords, and their Complices;
and desired them to make haste and come into
the Palace, for he should have the door of the
Privy Passage open, and should be speaking with
the Queen before their coming, conform to his
Device rehearsed before. Then the said Earl of
<hi>Morton,</hi> Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> and Lord <hi>Lindsey,</hi> with
their Complices, passed up to the Queen's utter
Chamber; and the said Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> passed in
through the King's Chamber, and up through the
privy way to the Queen's Chamber, as the King
had learned him, and through the Chamber to
the Cabinet, where he found the Queen's Majesty
sitting at her Supper at the middes of a little
Table, the Lady <hi>Argile</hi> sitting at one end, and
<hi>Davie</hi> at the head of the Table with his Cap on
his head, the King speaking with the Queen's
Majesty, and his hand about her Waste. The
said Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> at his coming in said to the


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34139:15"/>
Queen's Majesty, It would please your Majesty
to let yonder Man <hi>Davie</hi> come forth of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
for he hath been over-long here. Her
Majesty answered, What Offence hath he made?
The said Lord replied again, that he had made
great Offence to her Majesty's Honour, the King
her Husband, the Nobility and Commonweal of
the Realm. And how? saith she. It will please
your Majesty, said the said Lord, he hath offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
your Majesty's Honour, which I dare not be
so bold to speak of: As to the King your Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban's
Honour, he hath hindred him of the Crown
Matrimonial, which your Grace promised him,
besides many other things which are not necessary
to be expressed. And as to the Nobility, he hath
caused your Majesty to banish a great part, and
most chief thereof, and forefault them at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Parliament, that he might be made a Lord.
And as to your Common-weal, he hath been a
common destroyer thereof, in so far as he suffered
not your Majesty to grant or give any thing but
that which passed through his hands, by taking
of Bribes and Goods for the same; and caused
your Majesty to put out the Lord <hi>Ross</hi> from his
whole Lands, because he would not give over
the Lordship of <hi>Melvin</hi> to the said <hi>Davie;</hi> besides
many other inconveniences that he sollicited your
Majesty to do. Then the said Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> said
to the King, Sir, take the Queen's Majesty your
Sovereign and Wife to you, who stood all amazed
and wyst not what to do. Then her Majesty
rose on her feet and stood before <hi>Davie,</hi> he hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her Majesty by the plates of the Gown, lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
back over in the window, his Whiniard drawn
in his hand. <hi>Arthur Erskin</hi> and the Abbot of <hi>Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rood-house,</hi>
the Laird of <hi>Cr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch</hi> Master of the House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:34139:15"/>
with the French Apothecary, and one of
the Grooms of the Chamber, began to lay hands
upon the said Lord <hi>Ruthen,</hi> none of the King's
Party being present. Then the said Lord pulled
out his Whiniard, and freed himself while more
came in, and said to them, Lay not hands on me,
for I will not be handled; and at the incoming of
others into the Cabinet, the said Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> put
up his Whiniard. And with the rushing in of
Men the Board fell to the wallwards, with Meat
and Candles being thereon; and the Lady of <hi>Argile</hi>
took up one of the Candles in her hand: and in
the same instant the said Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> took the
Queen in his arms, and put her into the King's
arms, beseeching her Majesty not to be afraid;
for there was no Man there that would do her
Majesty's Body more harm than their own
Hearts; and assured her Majesty, all that was
done was the King's own Deed and Action.
Then the remanent Gentlemen being in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet,
took <hi>Davie</hi> out of the Window; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that they had him out in the Queen's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
the said Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> followed, and bad take
him down the privy way to the King's Chamber;
and the said Lord return'd to the Cabinet again,
believing that the said <hi>Davie</hi> had been had down
to the King's Chamber, as said is: but the press of
the People hurl'd him forth to the utter Chamber,
where there was a great number standing, who
were so vehemently moved against the said <hi>Davie,</hi>
that they could not abide any longer, but slew him
at the Queen's far Door in the utter Chamber.
Immediately the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> passed forth of the
Queen's Majesty's utter Chamber to the inner
Court for keeping of the same and the Gates, and
deputed certain Barons to keep <hi>Davie</hi>'s Chamber




<pb n="30" facs="tcp:34139:16"/>
till he knew the Queen's Majesty's pleasure, and
the King's. Shortly after their Majesties send
the Lord <hi>Lindsey</hi> and <hi>Arthur Erskin</hi> to the said
Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> to pass to <hi>David</hi>'s Chamber to
fetch a black Coffer with Writings and Cyphers,
which the said Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> delivered to them,
and gave the Chamber in keeping to <hi>Iohn Simple</hi>
Son to the Lord <hi>Simple,</hi> with the whole Goods
there, Gold, Silver, and Apparel being therein.
In this mean time the Queen's Majesty and the
King came forth of the Cabinet to the Queen's
Chamber, where her Majesty began to reason
with the King, saying, My Lord, Why have
you caused to do this wicked Deed to me, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
I took you from a base Estate, and made
you my Husband? What Offence have I made you
that ye should have done me such shame? The
King answered and said, I have good reason for
me; for since you Fellow <hi>Davie</hi> fell in credit and
familiarity with your Majesty, ye regarded me
not, neither treated me nor entertained me after
your wonted Fashion; for every day before Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and after Dinner, ye would come to my
Chamber and pass time with me, and thus long
time ye have not done so; and when I come to
your Majesty's Chamber, ye bear me little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
except <hi>Davie</hi> had been the third Marrow:
and after Supper your Majesty hath a use to set
at the Cards with the said <hi>Davie</hi> till one or two
of the Clock after midnight; and this is the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
that I have had of you this long time.
Her Majesty's answer was, It was not Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>womens
duty to come to their Husbands Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
but rather the Husband to come to the
Wive's Chamber, if he had any thing to do with
her. The King answered, How came ye to my


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:34139:16"/>
Chamber at the beginning, and ever, till within
these few Months<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that <hi>Davie</hi> fell in familiarity
with you? or am I failed in any sort of my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?
or what disdain have you at me? or what
Offence have I made you, that you should not
use me at all time alike? seeing that I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to do all things that becometh a good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
to do to his Wife. For since you have
chose me to be your Husband, suppose I be of
the baser degree, yet I am your Head, and ye
promised Obedience at the day of our Marriage,
and that I should be equal with you, and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant
in all things. I suppose you have used me
otherwise by the perswasions of <hi>Davie.</hi> Her
Majesty answered and said, that all the shame that
was done to her, that my Lord, ye have the
weight thereof; for the which I shall never be
your Wife, nor lie with you; nor shall never
like well, till I gar you have as sore a Heart as I
have presently. Then the Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> made
answer, and besought her Majesty to be of good
comfort, and to treat her self and the King her
Husband, and to use the Counsel of the Nobility,
and he was assured her Government should be as
well guided as ever it was in any King's days.
The said Lord being so feebled with his
Sickness, and wearied with his Travel, that
he desired her Majesty's pardon to sit down
upon a Coffer, and called for a drink for God's
sake: so a French man brought him a Cup of
Wine, and after that he had drunken, the Queen's
Majesty began to rail against the said Lord: Is
this your Sickness, Lord <hi>Ruthen?</hi> The said Lord
answered, God forbid that your Majesty had such
a Sickness; for I had rather give all the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Goods that I have. Then, said her Majesty,


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:34139:17"/>
if she died, or her Barn, or Common-weal
perished, she should leave the revenge thereof to
her Friends to revenge the same upon the said
Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> and his Posterity; for she had the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> her great Friend, the Emperor
likewise, and the King of <hi>France</hi> her good Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and her Unkels in
<hi>France,</hi> besides the Pope's Holiness, with many
other Princes in <hi>Italy.</hi> The said Lord answered
that these noble Princes were over-great Person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
to meddle with such a poor man as he was,
being her Majesty's own Subject: and where her
Majesty said, that if either she, her Barn, or the
Commonweal perished, the said Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi>
should have the weight thereof; the said Lord
answered, that if any of the three perished,
her Majesty's self and her particular Counsel
should have the weight thereof, and should be
accused as well before God as the World: for
there was no man there within that Palace, but
they that would honour and serve her Majesty,
as becometh true Subjects; and would suffer no
manner harm to be done to her Majesty's Body
than to their own Hearts; and if any thing be
done this night that your Majesty mislikes, charge
the King your Husband, and none of us your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
which the King confessed was of verity.
In the same instant one came knocking fast at
the Queen's Chamber-door, declaring that the
Earls <hi>Huntly, Athol, Bothwel, Cathness,</hi> and <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therland,</hi>
with the Lords <hi>Fleming, Levingstone,</hi>
Secretary, <hi>Tillibarn</hi> the Comptroller, and Laird
of <hi>Grant,</hi> with their own Servants and Officers
of the Palace, were fighting in the Close against
the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> and his Company, being on
the King's Party. The King hearing the same,


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:34139:17"/>
would have gone down, and the Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi>
staid him, and desired him to intreat the Queen's
Majesty, and he would go down and take order
amongst them. So the said Lord passed to the
Close, born under the Arm; and before his
coming the Officers were dwong into their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
and the Lords were holden in at the Gallery
Door by the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> and others being
with him, and were constrained to pass up to the
Gallery and to their Chambers. So the said Lord
<hi>Ruthen</hi> passed up to the Earl <hi>Bothwell</hi>'s Chamber,
where he found the Earls of <hi>Huntley, Sutherland,
Cathness,</hi> the Laird of <hi>Grant,</hi> and divers others, to
whom he shewed that the whole Proceeding that
was done that night, was done and invented by the
King's Majesty's own devise, like as his Hand writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
was to shew thereupon; and how he had sent
for the Lords that were banished in <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Argyle,</hi> who would be there before day: And
because there was some Enmity unreconciled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Earls of <hi>Huntly</hi> and <hi>Bothwell,</hi> and the
Earls of <hi>Argyle</hi> and <hi>Murray,</hi> and their Colleagues;
the said Lords promised in their names, that it
should be mended at the sight of two or three
of the Nobility, they doing such like to them;
whereupon the said Earls of <hi>Huntley</hi> and <hi>Bothwell</hi>
gave the Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> their hands, and received
his for th' other part: and after they had drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
the said Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> took his leave of them,
and passed to the Earl of <hi>Athol</hi>'s Chamber, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with the Earls of <hi>Cathness, Sutherland,</hi>
and the Laird of <hi>Grant;</hi> and found with the
said Earl the Comptroller, Secretary, Mr. <hi>Iames
Balfour,</hi> and divers others: and because of the
Familiarity and Kindness betwixt the Earl of
<hi>Athol</hi> and the Lord <hi>Ruthen,</hi> the said Earl began


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:34139:18"/>
to be angry with the said Lord, for that he would
not shew him what Enterprise soever that he had
to do; whose answer was, that it was the King's
Action and the King's Devise, and that none of
them had further medling therewith than the
King had commanded, like as his Hand written
did testify. Yet the said Earl enquired further
upon the said Lord <hi>Ruthen,</hi> why he would not let
him wit thereof: the said Lord answered, it
was the King's Secret; and feared if he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
knowledg thereof, he would have revealed
it to the Queen's Majesty, which might have been
a hindrance of the purpose, and caused the
King have holden me an unhonest man for my
part. The said Earl perceiving that all that
was done was the Kings own deed, desired the
said Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> to pass to the King, and get him
leave to pass to his Country, and so many as
were presently in the Chamber with him. In this
mean time the Earls of <hi>Bothwell</hi> and <hi>Huntly</hi> tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a fear of the other Lords returning out of
<hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Argyle,</hi> and because they were hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imprisoned before, thought it better to escape
too than to remain; so they went out at a low Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and passed their ways. In the mean time while
the Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> was with the Earl of <hi>Athol,</hi>
the King declared to the Queen's Majesty, that
he had sent for the Lords to return again;
whereunto she answered, she was not in the
blame that they were so long away: for she
could have been content to have brought them
home at any time, had not been for angering
the King; and to verify the same, when her
Majesty gave a remission to the Duke, the King
was very miscontent therewith: whereto the
King answered, that it was true that the King


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:34139:18"/>
was miscontented then, but now he was content,
and doubted not but she would also be content to
persevere in the good mind to them as she had
done before. At the same time came the Provost
of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and a great number of men of the
Town with him in Arms to the utter Court of
the Palace of <hi>Holyrood-House,</hi> where the King
called out of the Window to them, commanding
them to return to their Houses, like as they did;
for he declared to them that the Queen's
Majesty and he were in good health. The
Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> being come up to the Queen's
Chamber again, where the King was beside her,
he shewed them that there was no hurt done,
and that the Lords and all others were merry,
and no harm done. Then her Majesty enquired
what was become of <hi>Davie.</hi> The said Lord
<hi>Ruthen</hi> answered that he believed he was in the
King's Chamber; for he thought it not good to
shew her as he died, for fear of putting her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
in greater trouble presently. Then the
Queen's Majesty enquired of the said Lord what
great kindness was betwixt the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi>
and him, that rather than he and the remanent
should be forfaulted, that he would be forfault
with them. Remember ye not, said she, what
the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> would have had me done to
you for giving me the Ring? The said Lord <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi>
answered, that he would bear no quarrel
for that cause, but would forgive him and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
for God's sake; and as to that Ring, it
had no more virtue than another, and was one
little Ring with a pointed Diamond in it. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
ye not, said her Majesty, that ye said
it had a virtue to keep me from poisoning? yea
Madam (said he) I said so much, that the Ring


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34139:19"/>
had that virtue, only to take that evil opinion
out of your head of Poisoning, which you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that the Protestants would have done;
which the said Lord knew the contrary, that the
Protestants would have done no more harm to
your Majesty's Body than to their own Hearts;
but it was so imprinted in your Majesty's mind,
that it could not be taken away without a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
impression. Then said her Majesty to the
the said Lord, what Fault or Offence have I
made to be handled in this manner? Inquire,
said he, at the King your Husband. Nay, said
she, I will enquire of you: who answered,
Madam, it will please your Majesty, ye well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that ye have had this long time a few
number of privy Persons, and most special
<hi>Davie</hi> a Stranger <hi>Italian,</hi> who have guided and
ruled you contrary the Advice of your Nobility
and Counsel; and especially against these Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that were banished. Her Majesty answered,
were ye not one of my Council? what is the
cause that ye should not have declared, if I had
done any thing amiss against them that became
me not? The said Lord answered, because your
Majesty would hear no such thing: for all the
time that your Majesty was in <hi>Glascow</hi> or <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friese,</hi>
let see if ever ye caused your Council to
sit, or to reason upon any thing, but did all things
by your Majesty's self and your privy persons,
albeit the Nobility bare the Pains and Expences.
Well, said her Majesty, ye find great fault with
me, I will be contented to set down my Crown
before the Lords of the Articles; and if they
find I have offended, to give it where they please.
Then answered the Lord <hi>Ruthen,</hi> and said, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
Madam, that your Crown should be in such ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard;


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:34139:19"/>
but yet, Madam, who chose the Lords of
the Articles? Not I, said she. Saving your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's
Reverence, said the Lord <hi>Ruthen,</hi> ye chose
them all in <hi>Seaton,</hi> and nominated them: And as
for your Majesty's Council, it hath not been suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to wait freely this long time, but behoved
to say what was your Pleasure. And as to the
Lords of the Articles, your Majesty chose such
as would say whatsoever you thought expedient
to the Forfaulters of the Lords Banished: And
now when the Lords of the Articles have sitten
fourteen days reasoning on the Summons of
Treason, have ye found a just Head wherefore
they ought to be forfaulted? No, Madam, not so
much as one Point, without false Witness be
brought in against them; whereunto she gave
no answer.</p>
            <p>The said Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> perceiving that the
Queen's Majesty was weary, he said to the King,
Sir, it is best ye take your leave at the Queen's
Majesty, that she may take rest: So the King
took his good-night and came forth of the
Queen's Chamber, and we with him, and left
none there but the Ladies, Gentlewomen, and
the Grooms of the Queen's Majesty's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
And so soon as the King came to his own
Chamber, the said Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> declared the
Message he had from the Earl of <hi>Athol</hi> to the
King, that he might have license to return home
to <hi>Athol:</hi> Which the King was loth to do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
he gave him a Band that he should be his.
The Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> answered, that he was a true
Man of his Promise, and would keep the thing
he said, as well as others would do their Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing
and Seal. Then the King desired the
said Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> to fetch the Earl of <hi>Athol</hi> to


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:34139:20"/>
him; which he did: And after the King and
Earl of <hi>Athol</hi> had talked together, he desired
the said Earl to be ready to come whensoever he
should send for him. His answer was, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
it pleased the Queen's Grace and him to
send for him, that he would come gladly: And
the said Earl desired the King that he might speak
with the Queen's Majesty, which the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused.
And then the said Earl took his good
night, and passed to his Chamber, and the Lord
<hi>Ruthen</hi> with him, where he made him ready and
his Company to pass forth, like as they did; and
in his company were the Earls of <hi>Sutherland</hi> and
<hi>Cathness,</hi> the Master of <hi>Cathness,</hi> the Secretary,
and Controler, Mr. <hi>Iames Balfour,</hi> the Laird of
<hi>Grant,</hi> with divers others. Immediately the
King directed two Writings, subscribed with
his hand, on <hi>Saturday</hi> after the slaughter of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie,</hi>
to certain men of <hi>Edenburg</hi> bearing Office
for the time, charging them to convene Men in
Arms, and make watch within the Town upon
the Calsay; and to suffer none others to be seen
out of their Houses, except Protestants, under
all highest pain and charge that after may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
And on the morrow after, which was <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> the King directed a Letter,
subscribed with his hand, making mention that
it was not his Will that the Parliament should
hold, for divers Causes, but discharged the same
by the Tenor thereof: And therefore command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all Prelats, Earls, Lords, Barons, Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and Barrowis, and others that are warned
to the said Parliament, to depart from <hi>Edenburg</hi>
within three hours next after that Charge, under
the pain of Life, Lands, and Goods, except so
many as the King by his special command caused


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:34139:20"/>
to remain; which Letter was openly proclaimed
at the Market-Cross, and fully obeyed. The
Gates being locked, the King being in his Bed,
the Queen's Majesty walking in her Chamber,
the said Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> took air upon the lower
Gate, and the privy Passages: and at the King's
Command, in the mean time, <hi>Davie</hi> was hurled
down the steps of the Stairs from the place where
he was slain, and brought to the Porter's Lodg;
where the Porter's Servant taking off his Clothes,
said, This hath been his Destiny; for upon this
Chest was his first Bed when he entred into this
place, and now here he lieth again, a very ingrate
and misknowing Knave. The King's Whiniard
was found sticking in <hi>Davie</hi>'s side after he was
dead; but always the Queen inquired of the King
where his Whiniard was? who answered, that
he wit not well: Well, said she, it will be known
afterwards.</p>
            <p>On the morrow, which was <hi>Sunday, March</hi> 10.
the King rose at eight of the Clock, and passed to
the Queen's Majesty's Chamber, where he and she
fell to reasoning of the Matter proceeded the
night afore, the one grating on the other till it
was ten a Clock, that the King came down to his
Chamber; and at his coming from her, she desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him to let all the Ladies and Gentlewomen
come unto her; which the King granted, and
at his coming down shewed the same to the Earl
of <hi>Morton</hi> and Lord <hi>Ruthen,</hi> who were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with the same; and shewed the King,
that they feared that the Queen's Majesty would
traffick by them with the Lords, and all other
that would do for her, like as it followed indeed:
For instantly her Majesty wrote some Writing,
and caused them to write others in her Name to


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:34139:21"/>
the Earls of <hi>Argile, Huntly, Bothwel, Athol,</hi> and
others. After that the King had dined, on <hi>Sunday</hi>
he passed up to the Queen's Majesty's Chamber,
where the Queen made as she would have parted
with Barn, and caused the Midwife come and say
the same. So her Majesty complained that she
could get none of the Gentlewomen to come up
to her, Scots nor French. The King sending
this word to the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> and Lord <hi>Ruthen,</hi>
all were let in that pleased. At the same time
the Queen's Majesty thought that the Lord
<hi>Ruthen</hi> would do her Body harm, and sent <hi>Iohn
Simple,</hi> Son to the Lord <hi>Simple,</hi> to the said Lord
<hi>Ruthen,</hi> to enquire what her Majesty might
lippen unto in that behalf: Whose answer was,
that he would no more harm to her Body, than
to his own Heart; if any Man intended to do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
he should defend her Majesty Body at
the uttermost of his Power. And further the
said Lord said, her Majesty had experience of his
mind in that Night's proceeding, when he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
none come near her Majesty to molest and
trouble her. The said <hi>Iohn Simple</hi> brought this
Message to the said Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> at two of the
Clock Afternoon, on <hi>Sunday,</hi> sitting then in the
King's utter Chamber at his Dinner. At four of
the Clock the King came down to his Chamber,
where the Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> shewed him that the
Queen's Majesty was to steal out among the
throng of the Gentlewomen in their downcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as he said he was advertised. So the King
commanded him to give attendance thereto;
which he did, and put certain to the Door, and
let no Body nor Gentlewoman pass forth undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muffled.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:34139:21"/>
After, about 7 or 8 of the Clock, the Earls of
<hi>Murrey</hi> and <hi>Rothes,</hi> with their Complices, came
out of <hi>England,</hi> and lighted at the Abbey, and
were thankfully received of the King; and after
certain communing, the Earl of <hi>Murrey</hi> took his
Good-night of the King, and passed to the Earl
of <hi>Morton</hi>'s House to Supper. Immediately there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
the Queen's Majesty sent one of her Ush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
called <hi>Robert Phirsell,</hi> for the said Earl of
<hi>Murrey;</hi> who passed to her Majesty, whom she
received pleasantly, as appeared; and after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muning,
he passed to the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi>'s House
again, where he remained that Night. At this
time the King remained communing with the
Queen's Majesty, and after long reasoning with
her, she granted to lie with him all Night, he
coming to her Chamber, and putting all men out
of his utter Chamber, except the Waiters of his
Chamber, and made a complaint that her Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women
could not go forth at the door undismuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled
at the King's coming down. He shewed the
said Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> and Lord <hi>Ruthen,</hi> the whole
manner of his proceedings with the Queen's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty;
which they liked no way, because they
perceived the King grew effeminate again; and
said to him, we see no other but ye are able to
do that thing that will gar you and us both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.
Always he would have the said Earl and
Lord to rid all the House, conform to the Queen's
Majesty's desire; which they did, and the said
Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> passed and lay in the King's War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drobe:
and after he was lien down, <hi>George Doug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lass</hi>
came to him, and shewed him that the King
was fallen asleep. The said Lord caused <hi>George</hi>
to go to wake the King; and after that he had
gone in twice or thrice, finding him sleeping so


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:34139:22"/>
sound, he would not awake him. Thereat the
said Lord was very miscontented; the King slept
still till six in the morning, that the Lord <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi>
came and reproved him, that he had not kept
his Promise to the Queen's Majesty, in lying with
her all that Night. His answer was, that he was
fallen on such a dead sleep that he could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken;
and put the blame to <hi>William Tellor</hi>
one of his Servants that permitted him to sleep.
But always, said he, I will take my Night-gown
and go up to the Queen. The said Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi>
answered and said, I trust she shall serve you in
the Morning as you did her at Night. Always
the King passed up, being <hi>Monday</hi> the <hi>11th</hi> of
<hi>March</hi> at six of the Clock, to her Majesty's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and sat down on the Bedside, she being sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or at least made her self so, and sat there
by the space of one hour e're she spake word to
him. Then when her Majesty waked, she en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of the King, why he came not up yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
night conform to his Promise? He answered,
he fell in so dead a sleep, that he awaked not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
six. Now, saith he, am I come, and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to lie down beside her Majesty; but she would
not suffer him, for she was sick, and said, she
would rise incontinent. Then the King fell in
reasoning with her Majesty towards the return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the said Lords-that were banished, and
forgiving of them all Offences, and likewise for
the slaughter of <hi>Davie:</hi> and as appeared to him,
her Majesty was content; for the King came
down to his own Chamber at eight of the Clock
very merrily, and shewed the said Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi>
and Lord <hi>Ruthen,</hi> the proceedings betwixt him
and the Queen's Majesty: who answered him,
and said, all was but words that they heard. For


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:34139:22"/>
look how ye intend to perswade her Majesty;
we fear she will perswade you to follow her Will
and Desire, by reason she hath been trained up
from her Youth in the Court of <hi>France,</hi> as well
in the Affairs of <hi>France</hi> as <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the Privy
Council. Well, said the King, will ye let me
alone, and I will warrant to dress all things
well. And after that the King had put on his
Clothes, he passed at nine to the Queen's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
where he reasoned of many things with her
Majesty: And at his returning to his Dinner at
eleven, he declared to the Earls of <hi>Murrey</hi> and
<hi>Morton,</hi> Lords <hi>Ruthen</hi> and <hi>Lindzay,</hi> that he had
dressed the Queen's Majesty; that the said two
Earls, and Lord <hi>Ruthen,</hi> should come to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Queens Majesty, and she would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give,
and put in Oblivion all things by-past, and
bury them out of her Majesty's mind, as they had
never been. The said Earls and Lords answer'd,
that all that speaking was but policy; and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it were promised, little or nothing would
be kept. Always the King took freely in hand,
and bad them make such Security as they pleased,
and the Queen's Majesty and he should subscribe
the same. And then after Dinner the King passed
up again to the Queen's Chamber, where the
Midwife was made to come to him, and said, that
the Queen would not fail to part with Barn, if her
Majesty went not to some other place where there
were more freer Air; and in like manner divers
of the Lords said the same. And the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to his Chamber at three Afternoon, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
the same to the said Earls, and Lord <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then:</hi>
And in the mean time in came the French
Doctor, who declared to the King, that it was
unable to the Queen's Majesty to eschew a Fever;


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:34139:23"/>
which if she take, she will not fail to part with
Barn, without she were transported from that
place to some better aired place. After they
were departed, the King inquired of the said
Earls and Lords, what they thought of their
speaking? Who answered, they feared all was
but craft-and policy that was spoken and done.
Always the King would not trow the same, and
said, that she was a true Princess, and that thing
she promised, he would set his life for the same.
And between four and five Afternoon, the King
passed to the Queen's Chamber, and took the
Earls of <hi>Morton, Murrey,</hi> and Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi>
with him; and after they had come to the
Queen's utter Chamber, the King went in and
left the Lords, to know her pleasure, whether
her Majesty would come out of her utter Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
or if the Lords should come into her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty.
She took purpose, and came out of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Chamber, led by the King; the said Earls and
Lords sitting down upon their Knees, made their
general Oration by the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
and after, their particular Orations by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
And after that her Majesty had heard all,
her answer was, that it was not unknown to the
Lords, that she was never blood-thirsty, nor
greedy upon their Lands and Goods, sithence her
coming into <hi>Scotland;</hi> nor yet would be upon
theirs that were present, but would remit the
whole Number that was banished, or were at the
last dead; and bury and put all things in Oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as if they had never been; and so caused the
said Earls, Lords and Barons, to arise on their
Feet. And afterwards her Majesty desired them
to make their own Security in that sort they pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
best, and she should subscribe the same. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34139:23"/>
her Majesty took the King by the one hand,
and the Earl of <hi>Murrey</hi> by the other, and walked
in her said utter Chamber the space of one hour;
and then her Majesty passed into her inner Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
where she and the King appointed, that all
they that were on the King's Party, should go
forth of the place after Supper. The King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down to his Chamber afore six of the Clock,
the Articles which were the Security that were
on the King's Party, were given by the Earls of
<hi>Murrey</hi> and <hi>Morton,</hi> and Lords <hi>Ruthen</hi> and <hi>Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey</hi>
to the King, to be subscribed by the Queen,
which the King took in hand so soon as he had
supped to be done; and he desired the said Lords
to remove themselves out of the Palace, to that
effect, that her Majesty's Guard and Servants
might order all as they pleased. The Lords an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
was to the King, You may well cause us to
do that thing that is your pleasure, but it is sore
against our wills; for we fear all this is but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
that is meant towards us, and that the
Queen's Majesty will pass away secretly and take
you with her, either to the Castle of <hi>Edenburg,</hi>
or else <hi>Dunbar.</hi> And here the Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested,
that what end followed thereupon, or
what Blood was shed for the same, that it should
come upon the King's Head and Posterity, and
nought upon theirs. The King said, he should
warrant all. So they departed and took their
leave of the King, and passed all forth of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
of <hi>Holyrood-house</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi>'s
House, where they supped; and after Supper di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
Mr. <hi>Archibald Douglass</hi> to the King, to see
if the Queen's Majesty had subscribed the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Lords and Barons Security. The
King gave answer, that he had let the Queen's


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:34139:24"/>
Majesty see them, who found them very good;
and because she was sick and going to her Bed,
she delayed the subscribing of them to the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and immediately after Mr. <hi>Archibald</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Lords with answer. The Laird of
<hi>Traquair</hi> Master of the Guard made an Arrant to
the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> to see what the Lords were
doing, and after he was departed, the whole
Earls, Lords, and Barons, with Gentlemen,
passed to the Town of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to their Beds,
believing surely the Queen's Majesty's Promise,
and the King's.</p>
            <p>The same night about one a clock after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
the Queen's Majesty and the King with her,
went out at one Back-door that passed through the
Wine-Cellar; where <hi>Arthur Erskin</hi> the Capt in
of the Guard, and other 6 or 7 persons, met her
Majesty with her Horses, and rode toward <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar;</hi>
and on the morrow, which was Tuesday,
the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> the Lords hearing how the
Queen's Majesty was departed, and taken the
King with her, convened the Earls, Lords, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,
and Gentlemen, and after the matter was
appointed, enquired every man's opinion, which
concluded all to remain in the Town of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
till such time they might send some Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to her Majesty for performance of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
promised for their security; and to that
effect sent for the Lord <hi>Simple,</hi> and desired him
that he would pass to <hi>Dunbar</hi> with a Writing of
the Lords, which he granted to do, and received
the same, with a Copy of the Articles that the
King received before, and promised to do his
utter diligence to get the same immediately sped,
if it were the King and Queen's Majesties plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
so to do. After the Lord <hi>Simple</hi>'s coming


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:34139:24"/>
to <hi>Dunbar,</hi> having presented the Lords Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Majesties, he was evil taken with
the Queen's Majesty, who caus'd him to remain
three days; he reported at his returning, that
there was no good way to be looked for there, but
Extremity to the Earls, Lords, and Gentlemen,
who had been at the Slaughter of <hi>David,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
her Majesty's promise made before. At
that time her Majesty being in <hi>Dunbar,</hi> wrote to all
Earls, Lords, Barons, to meet her in <hi>Haddington</hi>
Town the <hi>17th</hi> or <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> and likewise
directed universal Letters, charging all manner
of men betwixt 60 and 16 to be there, day and
place aforesaid, being in Arms in fear of War;
and also sent divers charges to the Lord <hi>Eskin</hi>
Captain of the Castle of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> to shut up
the Town, unless the Lords departed out of it.
In this time it was declared to the Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi>
that if he would sue Address to the Queen's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
he would obtain the same, who shewed the
same to the Lords, who counselled him to write to
her Majesty to that effect; which he did, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
her Majesty's Answer with certain Articles.
In this time the Earl of <hi>Glencarn</hi> and <hi>Rothes</hi> took
their Appointment of the Queen's Majesty. The
Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> Lord <hi>Ruthen,</hi> and remanent
their Complices perceiving that the Queen's
Majesty was willing to remit the Lords banished
into <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Argyle,</hi> and bare her Majesty's
whole rage against them that were with the King
at the Slaughter of <hi>Davie,</hi> thought best to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
themselves into <hi>England</hi> under the Queen's
Majesty of <hi>England</hi>'s Protection, till such time
as the Nobility of <hi>Scotland</hi> their Peers understood
their Cause: for they have done nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the King's Command, as is before mentioned,


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:34139:25"/>
and doubt not but their Cause shall be found just
and honest whensoever the same be tried; and
lament the extream handling contrary to Order
and Justice, that they may not compear for fear
of their lives; in respect that her Majesty hath
caused a Band to be made, and all Earls, Lords,
and Barons that resorted to her Majesty, to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
the same, that they shall pursue the said
Earl <hi>Morton,</hi> Lord <hi>Ruthen,</hi> and <hi>Lindsay</hi> and their
Complices with Fire and Sword; which is against
all Order of the Law: And on Saturday the
<hi>22d</hi> of <hi>March</hi> her Majesty hath caused to be sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned

the pain of Rebellion, and putting them to
her Horn, and eschetting and bringing of all
their moveables Goods, the which like Order is
not used in no Realm Christened; nor is it the
Law of <hi>Scotland</hi> of old; but new cropen in, and
invented by them that understand no Law, nor
yet good practise: and how her Majesty hath
handled the Barons of <hi>Lothian</hi> our Brothers, it


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:34139:25"/>
is known; and in likewise our poor Brethren of
<hi>Edinburgh,</hi> Merchants and Craftsmen, and how
they are oppressed by the Men of War God
knoweth, who will put remedy hereto when it
pleaseth him best: and how the Lords and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons
Wives are oppressed in spoiling of their
Places, robbing of their Goods without any
Fine for the same, it would pity a godly Heart.
And where her Majesty alledgeth, that night
that <hi>Davie</hi> was slain some held Pistols to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Womb, some stroke Whiniards so near her
Crag, that she felt the coldness of the Iron, with
many other such like Sayings, which we take
God to record was never meant nor done; for
the said <hi>Davie</hi> receiv'd never a Stroke in her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's
presence, nor was not stricken till he was
at the farthest Door of her Majesty's utter Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
as is before rehearsed. Her Majesty makes
all these Allegations to draw the said Earl <hi>Morton,</hi>
Lords <hi>Ruthen</hi> and <hi>Lindsay,</hi> and their Complices, in
greater hatred with other foreign Princes, and
with the Nobility and Commonalty of the Realm,
who have experience of the contrary, and know

Body of <hi>David,</hi> which had been buried with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Doors of the next Church, should be
removed by night, and placed in the Sepulchre of the
last King and his Children: Which unworthy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exempled
Action, gave further occasion to disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
Reports of her. For what, said they, can be
a more manifest Confession of her Adultery, than to
make (as far as in her lies) a sordid Villain, who
had nothing commendable in himself, nor had done
any thing useful to the Publick, equal in the last of all
Honours paid to Men, with her Father and Brothers;
and (which seemed yet to be almost a great Indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
to put an impure Fellow, Raskal, as it were, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Arms of the late Queen <hi>Magdalen de Valois?</hi>
In the mean time she never ceased from menacing
her Husband, deriding him with bitter raillery, and
using the utmost of her Power to extinguish his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
with all Men, and to render him as contemptible as
she could. Strict inquiry was made concerning the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>David:</hi> Many of those who were suspected to be
concerned, were banished to different places; more were
fined in Sums of Mony, and some who had hardly
any part in the Action, and for that reason thought
themselves secure, were punished capitally with death;
for the principal Persons engaged in that Affair, had
either escaped into <hi>England,</hi> or concealed themselves
in the mountainous Countries of <hi>Scotland.</hi> All Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Magistracy, and Places of Trust, were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away from every one who was in the least sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
and conferred upon their Enemies. And a
Proclamation was published, forbidding men to say


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:34139:26"/>
that the King had any knowledg or part in the death
of <hi>David:</hi> But this, notwithstanding the publick Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities,
was entertained with a general Laughter.
In <hi>April</hi> following, these Disturbances being a little
calmed, the Earls of <hi>Argile</hi> and <hi>Murrey</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
into Favour, the Queen retired into the Castle
of <hi>Edinburg,</hi> (the time of her lying in approaching)
and on the 19th of <hi>June,</hi> a little after nine, she was
brought to bed of a Son, who was afterwards called
<hi>James</hi> the 6th.</p>
               <p>Equinoctialem.</p>
               <p>It was reported that one <hi>John Damiette</hi> a French
Priest, who was accounted a Magician, had often
admonished him <hi>(David)</hi> that having got much
Wealth, he should be gone, and so secure himself
from the hatred of the Nobility, who were too strong
a Party for him; and that his answer was, <hi>That
the Scots were more ready to talk than to fight:</hi>
And that a few days before his death, being advised
to beware of the Bastard; he said, That so long as
he lived, the Bastard should not have such Power in
<hi>Scotland</hi> as to cause him to fear: He thought the
Earl of <hi>Murrey</hi> was meant by that Name. But
whether this Warning was fulfilled, or eluded, so it
was in fact, That <hi>George Douglass,</hi> a Bastard of
the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> gave him the first Wound.</p>
