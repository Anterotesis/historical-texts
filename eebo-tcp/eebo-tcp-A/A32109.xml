            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

they (like the plagues of <hi>Egypt)</hi> have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runne

beare the greatest sway, to what a height of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency,

there is no doubt but there will arise a <hi>David</hi> of
truth, to beare downe their violent and Phantasticall
Doctrine, by which so many people are seduced,
these are those Sectarists that will abide no degrees
in Schooles, all humane Learning must be layd by,
Accademies are to them abhominable.</p>
            <p>Hence come those violent outrages, and sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
disorders committed in the Church, even in time
of Divine service, and the hubbubs, and strange Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
raised, where reverend silence ought to be used,
by laying violent hands upon the Ministers in divers
places and Parishes within this City, impudently as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
into their Pulpits, assuming to themselves the
power of preaching, others rending the Surplices
from their backs, they hardly escaping in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
from being torne in peeces, and that when the
Psalme hath beene singing, and the Preacher ready
to goe up into the Pulpit, to deliver his Sermon, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
by rending of the Rayles about the Communion
Table chopping them in peeces, and burning them in
Church-yard, and this to be done without Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or order, in a rude and riotous manner, as if wee
lived vnder no government; how many Riotous assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
and Routs by their concourse and disorderly
meetings in severall places of the Cities of <hi>London</hi> &amp;
<hi>Westminster,</hi> committing such insolencies and outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
at severall times, as if Justice and authority had
no power over them, to the great scandall and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Government of this City and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>Witnesse their tumultuous assembling and flocking
<pb facs="tcp:97760:4"/>
to the Parliament at divers times, with their vndecent
gestures and irreverent speeches in <hi>Westminster</hi> Hall,
and other places, for which to instance, there was 4.
men brought before the House of Commons <hi>Nov.</hi>
30. 1641. for making a hubbub in the Hall, crying
downe Antichrist and the Bishops, and saying, if they
could not be heard, they would have a farre greater
number the next day to back them, and the like.</p>
            <p>Likewise the next day many hundred of Citizens
flocking to the houses of Parliament, and called upon
the members, as they passed from their houses, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
Bishops, crying aloud, no Bishops, no Bishops,
calling them the limbes of <hi>Antichrist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On Wednesday Sir <hi>Iohn Strangwaies</hi> made a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
that he was assaulted by 100 in the streets, &amp;
had received offensive words, whereupon the House
fell into consideration for suppressing and repelling
of tumults, and disorders of that nature.</p>
            <p>This evening the Citizens begun to rayse the like
clamour againe, but being intreated to forbeare, and
depart home to their houses, the tumult ceased for
that time.</p>
            <p>Againe, on Friday <hi>Decemb.</hi> 4. many hundred of
Citizens and Brownists flocked to <hi>Westminster</hi> armed
with Swords and staves, as if they came to besiege the
Parliament-house, whereupon the Trayned Bands was
raised, and ceazed upon them, not knowing otherwise,
but that they came against the Parliament-house, to
that their plea was, they came to defend the truth,
but it was very true, that many of them were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to prison.</p>
            <p>Vpon <hi>Friday</hi> notice was given to the Parliament,
<pb facs="tcp:97760:4"/>
how that their number was so great, so that instantly
there was warrants sent unto each Constahle, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
sufficient men with Swords and Halberds, to
guard the Parliament-house.</p>
            <p>On Sunday last <hi>Decemb.</hi> 12. was a great assembly of
these Brownists gathered about St. <hi>Georges</hi> Church in
<hi>Southwarke,</hi> and one of their Preachers a Cobler by
profession violently went up into the Pulpit, &amp; made
a Sermon above an houre long, whom they assisted,
untill all the Constables thereabouts had raised ayd
to suppresse these tumultuous outrages.</p>
            <p>After this he went from thence to St. <hi>Olaves</hi> Church
neere the Bridge, with all his illitterate audience af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him, thinking to make another Sermon there also,
but being prevented, and that they could not get into
the Church, this Preaching Cobler stood up in the
Church Porch, and made a Sermon to them all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>These and the like disturbances and distractions I hope
the King and Parliament will take into their grave con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
and pious care, that the peace of this Church
and State, may not be clowded nor eclipsed by these mists
and errours of darkenesse and ignorance, and let it bee
the Prayer of all good Christians, that these AEgyptian
Locusts, that swarme in every corner of this City and
Kingdome, may be expelled, that we may enjoy the light
of the Gospell.</hi>

(according to their severall offences) back againe to
the place of imprisonment from whence they came,

condemned for their severall Treasons, according to
the Statute thereupon provided, where till Sunday af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

they grew tumultuous by throwing of stones
and other like stuffe, upon the Passengers in the
streets, who in great multitudes were then gaping up
at the Prison, and after a Sermon that night, all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.
On the next morning early Mr. <hi>Maccalee</hi>
the new visitor of the said prison came to them, with
an earnest request to know whether they were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to dye and also to receive the Sacrament, which
they all did really confesse, so that the said Iesuites
might suffer with them, who after some admonitions
to them, he expected their appearance in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
but presently they stood upon their guard, and
would not dye without them, upon which they having
got strength and stood in defiance, till Captain <hi>Geeres</hi>
with his Trayned Band came to suppresse them, then
the Sheriffes resolved to smother them, and provided
a quantity of wet Hay, which being fired did smoke
them up, after that the Armed men entred the prison
and they were all taken and bound in chaines and lye
ready to suffer according to their demerits, and wait
the time of their execution.</p>
