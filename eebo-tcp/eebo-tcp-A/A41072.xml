            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Womens Speaking Juſtified, Proved,
and Allowed by the Scriptures.</head>
            <p>WHereas it hath been an Objection in the minds of many, and
ſeveral times hath been objected by the Clergy, or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
and others, againſt Womens ſpeaking in the Church;
and ſo conſequently may be taken, that they are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for medling in the things of God; the ground of which Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is taken from the Apoſtles words, which he Writ in his firſt Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> chap. 14. verſ. 34, 35. And alſo what he writ
to <hi>Timothy</hi> in the firſt Epiſtle, chap. 2. verſ. 11, 12. But how far
they wrong the Apoſtle's intentions in theſe Scriptures, we ſhall ſhew
clearly when we come to them in their courſe and order. But firſt let
me lay down how God himſelf hath manifeſted his Will and Mind
concerning Women, and unto Women.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And firſt, When</hi> God created Man in his own Image; in the Image
of God created he them, Male and Female; and God bleſſed them; and
God ſaid unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply: And God ſaid, Behold,
I have given you of every Herb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Gen. 1. <hi>Here God joyns them
together in his own Image, and makes no ſuch diſtinctions and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
as men do; for though they be weak, he is ſtrong; and as he
ſaid to the Apoſtle,</hi> His Grace is ſufficient, <hi>and his</hi> ſtrength is made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
in weakneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. <hi>And ſuch hath the Lord choſen, even</hi>
the weak things of the world, to confound the things which are mighty; and
things which are deſpiſed, hath God choſen, to bring to nought things that
are, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>And God hath put no ſuch difference between the Male
and Female as men would make.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is true,</hi> The Serpent that was more ſubtile then any <hi>other</hi> Beaſt of the
Field, <hi>came unto the Woman, with his Temptations, and with a lie;
his ſubtilty diſcerning her to be more enclinable to hearken to him,
when he ſaid,</hi> If ye eat, your eyes ſhall be opened; <hi>and the Woman ſaw
that</hi> the Fruit was good to make one wiſe; <hi>there the temptation got into
her, and</hi> ſhe did eat, and gave to her Husband, and he did eat <hi>alſo, and
ſo they were both tempted into the tranſgreſſion and diſobedience;
and therefore God ſaid unto</hi> Adam, <hi>when that he hid himſelf when
he heard his voice,</hi> Haſt thou eaten of the Tree which I commanded thee
that thou ſhouldſt not eat? <hi>And</hi> Adam <hi>ſaid,</hi> The Woman which thou gaveſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52695:3"/>
me, ſhe gave me of the Tree, and I did eat. And the Lord ſaid unto the
Woman, What is this that thou haſt done? <hi>and the Woman ſaid,</hi> The
Serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. <hi>Here the Woman ſpoke the truth
unto the Lord: ſee what the Lord ſaith, verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>after he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
Sentence on the Serpent;</hi> I will put enmity between thee and the
Woman, and between thy Seed and her Seed; it ſhall bruiſe thy head, and
thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>Let this Word of the Lord, which was from the beginning, ſtop the
mouths of all that oppoſe Womens Speaking in the Power of the Lord;
for he hath put enmity between the Woman and the Serpent; and if
the Seed of the Woman ſpeak not, the Seed of the Serpent ſpeaks;
for God hath put enmity between the two Seeds, and it is manifeſt,
that thoſe that ſpeak againſt the Woman and her Seeds Speaking, ſpeak
out of the enmity of the old Serpents Seed; and God hath fulfilled his
Word and his Promiſe, <hi>When the fulneſs of time was come, he hath ſent
forth his Son, made of a Woman, made under the Law, that we might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the adoption of Sons,</hi> Gal. 4. 4, 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moreover, the Lord is pleaſed, when he mentions his Church, to
call her by the name of</hi> Woman, <hi>by his Prophets, ſaying,</hi> I have called
thee as a Woman forſaken, and grieved in Spirit, and as a Wife of Youth,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. <hi>Again,</hi> How long wilt thou go about, thou back-ſliding Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
For the Lord hath created a new thing in the earth, a Woman ſhall
compaſs a Man, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 22. <hi>And</hi> David, <hi>When he was ſpeaking of
Chriſt and his Church, he ſaith,</hi> The Kings Daughter is all glorious
within, her cloathing is of wrought Gold; ſhe ſhall be brought unto the
King: with gladneſs and rejoycing ſhall they be brought; they ſhall enter
into the Kings Pallace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. <hi>And alſo King</hi> Solomon <hi>in his Song,
where he ſpeaks of Chriſt and his Church, where ſhe is complaining
and calling for Chriſt, he ſaith,</hi> If thou knoweſt not, O thou faireſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
women, go thy way by the footſteps of the Flock, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>c.</hi> 5. 9.
<hi>And</hi> John, <hi>when he ſaw the wonder that was in Heaven, he ſaw</hi> a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
clothed with the Sun, and the Moon under her feet, and upon her head
a Crown of twelve Stars; and there appeared another wonder in Heaven, a
great red Dragon ſtood ready to devour her Child: <hi>here the enmity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that God put between the Woman and the Dragon,</hi> Revelations
12.</p>
            <p>Thus much may prove that the Church of Chriſt is a Woman, and
thoſe that ſpeak againſt the Womans ſpeaking, ſpeak againſt the Church
of Chriſt, and the Seed of the Woman, which Seed is Chriſt; that is
to ſay, Thoſe that ſpeak againſt the Power of the Lord, and the Spirit
of the Lord ſpeaking in a Woman, ſimply, by reaſon of her Sex, or
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52695:3"/>
becauſe ſhe is a Woman, not regarding the Seed, and Spirit, and
Power that ſpeaks in her; ſuch ſpeak againſt Chriſt, and his Church,
and are of the Seed of the Serpent, wherein lodgeth the enmity. And
as God the Father made no ſuch difference in the firſt Creation, nor
never ſince between the Male and the Female, but alwayes out of his
Mercy and loving kindneſs, had regard unto the weak. So alſo, his
Son, Chriſt Jeſus, confirms the ſame thing; when the <hi>Phariſees</hi> came to
him, and asked him, if it were lawful for a man to put away his Wife?
he anſwered and ſaid unto them, <hi>Have you not read, That he that made
them in the beginning, made them Male and Female,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>For this
cauſe ſhall a Man leave Father and Mother, and ſhall cleave unto his Wife,
and they twain ſhall be one fleſh, wherefore they are no more twain but one fleſh;
What therefore God hath joyned together, let no Man put aſunder,</hi> Mat. 19.</p>
            <p>Again, Chriſt Jeſus, when he came to the City of <hi>Samaria,</hi> where
<hi>Jacobs</hi> Well was, where the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> was; you may read,
in <hi>John</hi> 4. how he was pleaſed to preach the Everlaſting Goſpel to her;
and when the Woman ſaid unto him, <hi>I know that when the Meſſiah com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi>
(which is called Chriſt) <hi>when he cometh, he will tell us all things;</hi>
Jeſus ſaith unto her, <hi>I that ſpeak unto thee am he;</hi> This is more than
ever he ſaid in plain words to Man or Woman (that we read of) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſuffered. Alſo he ſaid unto <hi>Martha,</hi> when ſhe ſaid, ſhe knew
that her Brother ſhould riſe again in the laſt day, Jeſus ſaid unto her,
<hi>I am the Reſurrection and the Life: he that believeth on me, though he were
dead, yet ſhall he live; and whoſoever liveth and believeth ſhall never die.
Believeſt thou this?</hi> ſhe anſwered, <hi>Yea Lord, I believe thou art the Chriſt,
the Son of God.</hi> Here ſhe manifeſted her true and ſaving Faith, which
few at that day believed ſo on him, <hi>John</hi> 11. 25, 26.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alſo that Woman that came unto Jeſus with an Alabaſter Box of
very precious Oyntment, and poured it on his Head as he ſat at meat;
it's manifeſted that this Woman knew more of the ſecret Power and
Wiſdom of God, then his Diſciples did, that were filled with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
againſt her; and therefore Jeſus ſaith,</hi> Why do ye trouble the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man?
for ſhe hath wrought a good work upon me; Verily, I ſay unto you,
Whereſoever this Goſpel ſhall be preached in the whole World, there ſhall alſo
this that this Woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her, <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.
<hi>Mark</hi> 14. 3. Luke <hi>ſaith further,</hi> She was a ſinner, <hi>and that</hi> ſhe ſtood
at his feet behind him weeping, and began to waſh his feet with her tears,
and did wipe them with the hair of her head, and kiſſed his feet, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
them with Oyntment. <hi>And when Jeſus ſaw the Heart of the</hi> Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raiſee
<hi>that had bidden him to his houſe, he took occaſion to ſpeak unto</hi>
Simon, <hi>as you may read in</hi> Luke 7. <hi>and he turned to the Woman, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52695:4"/>
ſaid, Simon,</hi> ſeeſt thou this Woman? Thou gaveſt me no water to my feet;
but ſhe hath waſhed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hair of her
head: Thou gaveſt me no kiſs; but this Woman, ſince I came in, hath not
ceaſed to kiſs my Feet: My Head with Oyl thou didſt not annoint; but this
Woman hath annointed my Feet with Oyntment: Wherefore I ſay unto thee,
her ſins, which are many, are forgiven her, for ſhe hath loved much,
<hi>Luke</hi> 7. 37, <hi>to the end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo there was many Women which followed Jeſus from <hi>Galilee,</hi>
miniſtring unto him, and ſtood afar off when he was Crucified, <hi>Mat.</hi>
28. 55. <hi>Mark</hi> 15. Yea even the Women of Jeruſalem wept for him,
inſomuch that he ſaid unto them, <hi>Weep not for me, ye Daughters of</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,
<hi>but weep for your ſelves, and for your Children,</hi> Luke 23.
28.</p>
            <p>And certain Women which had been healed of evil Spirits and Infirmities,
<hi>Mary Magdalen;</hi> and <hi>Joanna</hi> the wife of <hi>Chuza, Herods</hi> Stewards
Wife; and many others which miniſtred unto him of their ſubſtance, <hi>Luke</hi>
8. 2, 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus we ſee that Jeſus owned the Love and Grace that appeared in
Women, and did not deſpiſe it; and by what is recorded in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
he received as much love, kindneſs, compaſſion, and tender
dealing towards him from Women, as he did from any others, both in
his life time, and alſo after they had exerciſed their cruelty upon him;
for</hi> Mary Magdalene, <hi>and</hi> Mary <hi>the Mother of</hi> Joſes, <hi>beheld where he
was ſaid;</hi> And when the Sabbath was paſt, <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi>
the Mother of <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>Salom,</hi> had brought ſweet ſpices that they might
annoint him: And very early in the morning, the firſt day of the week,
they came unto the Sepulchre at the riſing of the Sun; And they ſaid among
themſelves, Who ſhall roll us away the ſtone from the door of the Sepulchre?
And when they looked, the ſtone was rolled away, for it was very great;
<hi>Mark</hi> 16. 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 1, 2. and they went down into the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre;
<hi>and as</hi> Matthew <hi>ſaith,</hi> The Angel rolled away the ſtone; and he
ſaid unto the Women, Fear not, I know whom ye ſeek, Jeſus which was
Crucified: he is not here, he is riſen, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>Now</hi> Luke <hi>ſaith thus,
That</hi> there ſtood two men by them in ſhining apparel, and as they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
and afraid, the men ſaid unto them, He is not here; remember how
he ſaid unto you when he was in <hi>Galilee,</hi> That the Son of Man muſt be
delivered into the hands of ſinful men, and be crucified, and the third day riſe
again; and they remembred his words, and returned from the Sepulchre,
and told all theſe things to the eleven, and to all the reſt.</p>
            <p>It was <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> and <hi>Joanna,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of <hi>James,</hi>
and the other Women that were with them, which told theſe things to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52695:4"/>
the Apoſtles, <hi>And their words ſeemed unto them as idle tales, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
them not.</hi> Mark this, ye deſpiſers of the weakneſs of Women,
and look upon your ſelves to be ſo wiſe; but Chriſt Jeſus doth not ſo,
for he makes uſe of the weak: for when he met the Women after he
was riſen, he ſaid unto them, <hi>All Hail,</hi> and they came and held him
by the Feet, and worſhipped him; then ſaid Jeſus unto them, <hi>Be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid;
go tell my Brethren that they go into</hi> Gallilee, <hi>and there they ſhall
ſee me,</hi> Mat. 28. 10. Mark 16. 9. And <hi>John</hi> ſaith, when <hi>Mary</hi> was
weeping at the Sepulchre, that Jeſus ſaid unto her, <hi>Woman, why weepeſt
thou? what ſeekeſt thou? And when ſhe ſuppoſed him to be the Gardiner,
Jeſus ſaith unto her,</hi> Mary; <hi>ſhe turned her ſelf, and ſaith unto him, Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boni,
which is to ſay Maſter; Jeſus ſaith unto her, Touch me not, for I
am not yet aſcended to my Father, but go to my Brethren, and ſay unto them,
I aſcend unto my Father, and your Father, and to my God, and your God,</hi>
John 20. 16, 17.</p>
            <p>Mark this, you that deſpiſe and oppoſe the Meſſage of the Lord God
that he ſends by Women; what had become of the Redemption of the
whole Body of Man-kind, if they had not believed the Meſſage that
the Lord Jeſus ſent by theſe Women, of and concerning his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection?
And if theſe Women had not thus, out of their tenderneſs
and bowels of love, who had received Mercy, and Grace, and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of ſins, and Virtue, and Healing from him; which many men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
had received the like, if their hearts had not been ſo united and knit
unto him in love, that they could not depart as the men did, but ſat
watching, and waiting, and weeping about the Sepulchre until the time
of his Reſurrection, and ſo were ready to carry his Meſſage, as is
manifeſted; elſe how ſhould his Diſciples have known, who were not
there?</p>
            <p>Oh! bleſſed and glorified be the Glorious Lord; for this may all the
whole body of man-kind ſay, though the wiſdom of man, that never
knew God, is alwayes ready to except againſt the weak; but the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of God is ſtronger then men, and the fooliſhneſs of God is wiſer
then men.</p>
            <p>And in <hi>Act.</hi> 18. you may read how <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> took unto them
<hi>Apollos,</hi> and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly; who
was an elloquent man, and mighty in the Scriptures; yet we do not
read that he deſpiſed what <hi>Priſcilla</hi> ſaid, becauſe ſhe was a Woman, as
many now do.</p>
            <p>And now to the Apoſtles words, which is the ground of the great
Objection againſt Womens Speaking; And firſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. let the
Reader ſeriouſly read that Chapter, and ſee the end and drift of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52695:5"/>
Apoſtle in ſpeaking theſe words: for the Apoſtle is there exhorting the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> unto charity, and to deſire Spiritual gifts, and not to ſpeak
in an unknown tongue; and not to be Children in underſtanding, but
to be Children in malice, but in underſtanding to be men; and that
the Spirits of the Prophets ſhould be ſubject to the Prophets; for God
is not the Author of Confuſion, but of Peace: And then he ſaith, <hi>Let
your Women keep ſilence in the Church,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Where it doth plainly appear that the Women, as well as others,
that were among them, were in confuſion; for he ſaith,</hi> How is it Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren?
when ye come together, every one of you hath a Pſalm, hath a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
hath a Tongue, hath a Revelation, hath an Interpretation? let all
things be done to edifying. <hi>Here was no edifying, but all was in confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
ſpeaking together; Therefore he ſaith,</hi> If any man ſpeak in an
unknown Tongue, let it be by two, or at moſt by three, and that by courſe;
and let one Interpret; but if there be no Interpreter, let him keep ſilence in
the Church. <hi>Here the Man is commanded to keep ſilence as well as
the Woman, when they are in cofuſion and out of order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Apoſtle ſaith further,</hi> They are commanded to be in Obedience,
<hi>as alſo ſaith the Law; and</hi> if they will learn any thing, let them ask their
Husbands at home; for it is a ſhame for a Woman to ſpeak in the Church.</p>
            <p>Here the Apoſtle clearly manifeſts his intent; for he ſpeaks of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that were under the Law, and in that Tranſgreſſion as <hi>Eve</hi> was,
and ſuch as were to learn, and not to ſpeak publickly, but they muſt
firſt ask their Husbands at home; and it was a ſhame for ſuch to ſpeak
in the Church: And it appears clearly, that ſuch Women were ſpeaking
among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> by the Apoſtles exhorting them from malice and
ſtrife, and confuſion, and he preacheth the Law unto them, and he ſaith,
in the Law it is written, <hi>With men of other tongues, and other lips, will
I ſpeak unto this people,</hi> verſ. 2.</p>
            <p>And what is all this to Womens Speaking? that have the Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Goſpel to preach, and upon whom the Promiſe of the Lord is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,
and his Spirit poured upon them according to his Word, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.
16, 17, 18. And if the Apoſtle would have ſtopped ſuch as had the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the Lord poured upon them, why did he ſay juſt before, <hi>If any
thing be revealed to another that ſuteth by, let the firſt hold his peace?</hi>
and <hi>you may all propheſie one by one.</hi> Here he did not ſay that ſuch Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
ſhould not Prophecſie as had the Revelation and Spirit of God
poured upon them; but their Women that were under the Law, and in
the Tranſgreſſion, and were in ſtrife, confuſion &amp; malice in their ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
for if he had ſtopt Womens praying or propheſying, why doth he
ſay, <hi>Every man praying or propheſying, having his head covered, diſhonoureth
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52695:5"/>
his head; but every Woman that prayeth or propheſieth with her head unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
diſhonoureth her head? Judge in your ſelves, Is it comely that a
Woman pray or propheſie uncovered? For the Woman is not without the Man,
neither is the Man without the Woman, in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 3, 4, 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alſo that other Scripture, in</hi> 1 Tim. 2. <hi>where he is exhorting that
Prayer and Supplication be made every where, lifting up holy Hands
without wrath and doubting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſaith in the like manner alſo, That</hi>
Women muſt adorn themſelves in modeſt apparel, with ſhamefaſtneſs and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety,
not with broidered hair, or gold, or pearl, or coſtly array; <hi>He ſaith,</hi>
Let Women learn in ſilence with all ſubjection, but I ſuffer not a Woman to
teach, nor to uſurp authority over the Man, but to be in ſilence; for <hi>Adam</hi>
was firſt formed, then <hi>Eve;</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> was not deceived, but the Woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deceived was in the tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <p>Here the Apoſtle ſpeaks particularly to a Woman in Relation to her
Husband, to be in ſubjection to him, and not to teach, nor uſurp au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over him, and therefore he mentions <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve;</hi> But let
it be ſtrained to the utmoſt, as the oppoſers of Womens Speaking
would have it, that is, That they ſhould not preach nor ſpeak in the
Church, of which there is nothing here; Yet the Apoſtle is ſpeaking
to ſuch as he is teaching to wear their apparel, what to wear, and what
not to wear; ſuch as were not come to wear modeſt apparel, and ſuch
as were not come to ſhamefaſtneſs and ſobriety, but he was exhorting
them from broidered hair, gold, and pearls, and coſtly array; and ſuch
are not to uſurp authority over the Man, but to learn in ſilence with
all ſubjection, as it becometh Women profeſſing Godlineſs with good
works.</p>
            <p>And what is all this to ſuch as have the Power and Spirit of the Lord
Jeſus poured upon them, and have the Meſſage of the Lord Jeſus gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
unto them? muſt not they ſpeak the Word of the Lord becauſe of
theſe undecent and unreverent Women that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, and
to, in theſe two Scriptures? And how are the men of this Generation
blinded, that bring theſe Scriptures, and pervert the Apoſtles Words,
and corrupt his intent in ſpeaking of them? and by theſe Scriptures, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to ſtop the Meſſage and Word of the Lord God in Women, by
contemning and deſpiſing of them. If the Apoſtle would have had
Womens ſpeaking ſtopt, and did not allow of them, why did he entreat
his true Yoak-Fellow to help thoſe Women who laboured with him in
the Goſpel? <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 3. And why did the Apoſtles joyn together in
Prayer and Supplication with the Women, and <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of
Jeſus, and with his Brethren, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 14. if they had not allowed,
and had union and fellowſhip with the Spirit of God, wherever it was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:52695:6"/>
revealed in Women as well as others? But all this oppoſing and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying
of Womens Speaking, hath riſen out of the bottomleſs Pit, and
ſpirit of Darkneſs that hath ſpoken for theſe many hundred years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in this night of Apoſtacy, ſince the Revelations have ceaſed and
been hid; and ſo that ſpirit hath limited and bound all up within its
bond and compaſs, and ſo would ſuffer none to ſpeak, but ſuch as that
ſpirit of Darkneſs, approved of, Man or Woman.</p>
            <p>And ſo here hath been the miſery of theſe laſt Ages paſt, in the time
of the Reign of the Beaſt, that <hi>John</hi> ſaw when he ſtood upon the Sand
of the Sea, riſing out of the Sea, and out of the Earth, having ſeven
Heads and ten Horns, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. In this great City of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which
is the Woman that hath ſitten ſo long upon the Scarlet-coloured Beaſt,
full of names of Blaſphemy, having ſeven Heads and ten Horns; and
this Woman hath been arrayed and decked with gold, and pearls, and
precious ſtones; and ſhe hath had a golden Cup in her hand, full of
Abominations, and hath made all Nations drunk with the Cup of her
Fornication; and all the world hath wondred after the Beaſt, and hath
worſhiped the Dragon that gave power to the Beaſt; and this woman
hath been drunk with the blood of the Saints, and with the blood of
the Martyrs of Jeſus; and this hath been the woman that hath been
ſpeaking and uſurping authority for many hundred years together:
And let the times and ages paſt teſtifie how many have been murdered
and ſlain, in Ages and Generations paſt; every Religion and Profeſſion
(as it hath been called) killing and murdering one another, that would
not joyn one with another: And thus the Spirit of Truth, and the Power
of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath been quite loſt among them that have
done this; and this mother of Harlots hath ſitten as a Queen, and ſaid,
<hi>She ſhould ſee no ſorrow;</hi> but though her dayes have been long, even
many hundred of years, for there was power given unto the Beaſt, to
continue forty and two months, and to make war with the Saints, and
to overcome them; and all that have dwelt upon the earth have wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped
him, whoſe names are not written in the Book of the Life of the
Lamb, ſlain from the foundation of the world.</p>
            <p>But bleſſed be the Lord, his time is over, which was above twelve
hundred years, and the darkneſs is paſt, and the night of Apoſtacy
draws to an end, and the true Light now ſhines, the morning-Light,
the bright morning-Star, the Root and Off-ſpring of <hi>David,</hi> he is riſen,
he is riſen, glory to the higheſt for evermore; and the Joy of the
morning is come, and the Bride, the Lambs Wife, is making her ſelf
ready, as a Bride that is adorning for her Husband, and to her is granted
that ſhe ſhall be arrayed in fine linnen, clean and white, and the fine
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52695:6"/>
linnen is the Righteouſneſs of the Saints; The <hi>Holy Jeruſalem</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
out of Heaven from God, having the Glory of God, and her
Light is like a Jaſper ſtone, clear as Chriſtal.</p>
            <p>And this is that free Woman that all the Children of the Promiſe are
born of: not the Children of the bond-woman, which is <hi>Hagar,</hi> which
genders to ſtrife and to bondage, and which anſwers to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which
is in bondage with her Children; but this is <hi>the Jeruſalem which is free,
which is the Mother of us all;</hi> And ſo this bond-woman and her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
that are born after the fleſh, have perſecuted them that are
born after the Spirit, even until now; but now the bond-woman and
her Seed is to be caſt out, that hath kept ſo long in bondage and in ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and under limits; this bond-woman and her brood is to be caſt
out, and our Holy City, the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> is coming down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and her Light will ſhine throughout the whole earth, even as a
<hi>Jaſper ſtone, clear as Chriſtal,</hi> which brings freedom and liberty, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Redemption to her whole Seed; and this is that Woman and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of the Eternal God, that God hath owned, and doth own, and will
own for evermore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>More might be added to this purpoſe, both out of the Old Teſtament
and New, where it is evident that God made no difference, but gave
his good Spirit, as it pleaſed him, both to Man and Woman, as</hi> Deborah,
Huldah, <hi>&amp;</hi> Sarah. <hi>The Lord calls by his</hi> prophet Iſaiah, Hearken unto me,
ye that follow after Righteouſneſs, ye that ſeek the Lord, look unto the Rock
from whence ye were hewen, and to the hole of the Pit from whence ye were
digged; look unto <hi>Abraham</hi> your Father, and to <hi>Sarah</hi> that bare you;
for the Lord will comfort <hi>Sion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. And <hi>Anna</hi> the Propheteſs,
who was a Widow of fourſcore and four years of age, which departed not
from the Temple, but ſerved God with faſtings and prayers night and day,
ſhe coming in at that inſtant, <hi>(when old</hi> Simeon <hi>took the Child Jeſus in
his arms, and)</hi> ſhe gave thanks unto the Lord, and ſpake of him to all
them who looked for Redemption in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Luke 2. 36, 37, 38. <hi>And</hi>
Philip <hi>the Evangeliſt, into whoſe houſe the Apoſtle</hi> Paul <hi>entered, who
was one of the Seven,</hi> Acts. 6. 3. <hi>He had four Daughters which were
Virgins, that did propheſie,</hi> Acts 21.</p>
            <p>And ſo let this ſerve to ſtop that oppoſing Spirit that would limit
the Power and Spirit of the Lord Jeſus, whoſe Spirit is poured upon
all fleſh, both Sons and Daughters, now in his Reſurrection; and ſince
that the Lord God in the Creation, when he made man in his own I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
he made them <hi>male</hi> and <hi>female;</hi> and ſince that Chriſt Jeſus, as
the Apoſtle ſaith, was made of a Woman, and the power of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
overſhadowed her, and the holy Ghoſt came upon her, and the holy
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52695:7"/>
thing that was born of her, was called <hi>the Son of God,</hi> and when he was
upon the Earth, he manifeſted his <hi>love,</hi> and his <hi>will,</hi> and his <hi>mind,</hi> both
to the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and <hi>Marcha,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> her Siſter, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
others, as hath been ſhewed and after his Reſurrection alſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
himſelf unto them firſt of all, even before he aſcended unto his
Father. <hi>Now when Jeſus was riſen, the firſt day of the week, he appeared
firſt unto Mary Magdalene,</hi> Mark 16. 9. And thus the Lord Jeſus hath
manifeſted himſelf and his Power, without reſpect of Perſons; and ſo let
all mouths be ſtopt that would limit him, whoſe Power and Spirit is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
that is pouring it upon all ſleſh.</p>
            <p>And thus much in anſwer to theſe two Scriptures, which have been
ſuch a ſtumbling block, that the miniſters of Darkneſs have made ſuch
a mountain of; But the Lord is removing all this, and taking it out of
the way.</p>

            <head>A further Addition in Anſwer to the Objection concerning Women keeping
ſilent in the Church; For it is not permitted for them to ſpeak, but to
be under obedience; as alſo ſaith the Law, If they will learn any
thing, let them ask their Husbands at home, for it is a ſhame for a
Woman to ſpeak in the Church; Now this as Paul writeth in 1 Cor.
14. 34. is one with that of 1 Tim. 2. 11. Let Women learn in ſilence
with all ſubjection.</head>
            <p>TO which I ſay, If you tie this to all outward Women, then there
were many Women that were Widows which had no Husbands
to learn of, and many were Virgins which had no Husbands; and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
had four Daughters that were Prophets; ſuch would be deſpiſed, which
the Apoſtle did not forbid: And if it were to all Women, that no Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
might ſpeak, then <hi>Paul</hi> would have contradicted himſelf; but they
were ſuch Women that the Apoſtle mentions in <hi>Timothy,</hi> That <hi>grew
wanton, and were buſie-bodies, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>atlers, and kicked againſt Chriſt:</hi> For
Chriſt in the Male and in the Female is one, and he is the Husband, and
his Wife is the Church; and God hath ſaid, that his <hi>Daughters</hi> ſhould
Propheſie as well as his <hi>Sons:</hi> And where he hath poured forth his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
upon them, they muſt propheſie, though blind Prieſts ſay to the
contrary, and will not permit holy Women to ſpeak.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>And whereas it is ſaid,</hi> I permit not a Woman to ſpeak, as ſaith the Law:
<hi>but where Women are led by the Spirit of God, they are not under the
Law, for Chriſt in the Male and in the Female is one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and where he is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52695:7"/>
made manifeſt in Male and Female, he may ſpeak, for</hi> he is the end of the
Law for Righteouſneſs to all them that believe. <hi>So here you ought to make
a diſtinction what ſort of Women are forbidden to ſpeak, ſuch as were
under the Law, who were not come to Chriſt, nor to the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie:
For</hi> Hulda, Miriam, <hi>and</hi> Hanna, <hi>were Prophets, who were not
forbidden in the time of the Law, for hey all propheſied in the time of
the Law; as you may read, in</hi> 2 Kings 22. <hi>what</hi> Hulda <hi>ſaid unto the
Prieſt, and to the Ambaſſadors that were ſent to her from the King,</hi> Go,
<hi>ſaith ſhe,</hi> and tell the Man that ſent you to me, Thus ſaith the Lord God of
Iſrael, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and on the Inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
even all the words of the Book which the King of <hi>Judah</hi> hath read; becauſe
they have forſaken me, and have burnt Incenſe to other Gods, to anger me
with all the works of their hands: Therefore my wrath ſhall be kindled
againſt this place, and ſhall not be quenched. But to the King of <hi>Judah,</hi> that
ſent you to me to ask counſel of the Lord, ſo ſhall you ſay to him, Thus ſaith
the Lord God of Iſrael, Becauſe thy heart did melt, and thou humbledſt thy ſelf
before the Lord, when thou heardſt what I ſpake againſt this place, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Inhabitants of the ſame, how they ſhould be deſtroyed; Behold I
will receive thee to thy Father, and thou ſhalt be put into thy Grave in peace,
and thine eyes ſhall not ſee all the evil which I will bring upon this place.
<hi>Now let us ſee if any of you blind Prieſts can ſpeak after this manner,
and ſee if it be not a better Sermon then any of you can make, who are
againſt Womens Speaking? And</hi> Iſaiah, <hi>that went to the Propheteſs,
did not forbid her Speaking or Propheſying,</hi> Iſa. 8. <hi>And was it not
propheſied in</hi> Joel 2. <hi>that</hi> Hand-maids ſhould Propheſie? <hi>And are
not Hand-maids Women? Conſider this, ye that are againſt Womens
Speaking, how in the</hi> Acts <hi>the Spirit of the Lord was poured forth upon
Daughters as well as Sons. In the time of the Goſpel, when</hi> Mary
<hi>came to ſalute</hi> Elizabeth in the Hill Countrey in <hi>Judea,</hi> and when <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
heard the ſalutation of <hi>Mary,</hi> the Babe leaped in her Womb, and ſhe was
filled with the Holy Spirit; and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſpoke with a loud voice, Bleſſed
art thou amongſt Women, bleſſed is the fruit of thy Womb; whence is this to
me, that the Mother of my Lord ſhould come to me? for lo, as ſoon as thy
Salutation came to my ear, the Babe leaped in my Womb for joy; for bleſſed
is ſhe that believes, for there ſhall be a performance of thoſe things which
were told her from the Lord. <hi>And this was</hi> Elizabeths <hi>Sermon concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Chriſt, which at this day ſtands upon Record: And then</hi> Mary <hi>ſaid,</hi>
My Soul doth magnifie the Lord, and my Spirit rejoyceth in God my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
for he hath regarded the low eſtate of his Hand-maid: for behold, from
henceforth all Generations ſhall call me bleſſed; for he that is mighty hath
done to me great things, and holy is his Name; and his Mercy is on them
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52695:8"/>
that fear him, from Generation to Generation; he hath ſhewed ſtrength with
his Arm; he hath ſcattered the proud in the imaginations of their own hearts;
he hath put down the mighty from their Seats, and exalted them of low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree;
he hath filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he hath ſent
empty away; he hath helpen his Servant <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in remembrance of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
as he ſpake to his Father, to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his Seed for ever. <hi>Are
you not here beholding to the Woman for her Sermon, to uſe her words
to put into your Common Prayer? and yet you forbid Womens Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Now here you may ſee how theſe two Women propheſied of Chriſt,
and Preached better then all the blind Prieſts did in that Age, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then this Age alſo, who are beholding to Women to make uſe of
their Words. And ſee in the Book of</hi> Ruth, <hi>how the Women bleſſed

in the ſecond Chapter of</hi> Samuel, <hi>How ſhe rejoyced in God, and ſaid,</hi>
My heart rejoyceth in the Lord; My Horn is exalted in the Lord, and my
mouth is enlarged over my enemies, becauſe I rejoyce in thy Salvation; there
is none holy as the Lord, yea, there is none beſides thee; and there is no God
like our God: Speak no more preſumptuouſly, let not arrogancy come out of
your months, for the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him enterpriſes are
eſtabliſhed; the Bow, and the mighty Men are broken, and the weak hath
girded to themſelves ſtrength; they that were full, are hired forth for bread,
and the hungry are no more hired; ſo that the barren hath born ſeven, and ſhe
that had many Children, is feeble; the Lord killeth, and maketh alive;
bringeth down to the Grave, and raiſeth up; the Lord maketh poor, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
rich, bringeth low and exalteth; he raiſeth up the poor out of the duſt, and
lifteth up the Beggar from the dunghil to ſet them among Princes, to make
them inherit the ſeat of Glory; for the Pillars of the <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52695:8"/>
a woman hath ſaid, when old</hi> Ely <hi>the Prieſt thought ſhe had been drunk:
and ſee if any of you blind Prieſts that ſpeak againſt Womens Speaking,
can Preach after this manner? who cannot make ſuch a Sermon as this
woman did, &amp; yet will make a trade of this Woman and other womens
words. And did not the Queen of</hi> Sheba <hi>ſpeak, that came to</hi> Solomon, <hi>and
received the</hi> Law of God, <hi>&amp;</hi> preached <hi>it in her own Kingdom, and</hi> bleſſed
the Lord God that loved <hi>Solomon,</hi> and ſet him on the throne of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe
the Lord loved <hi>Iſrael</hi> for ever; and made the King to do Equity and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs?
<hi>And this was the language of the Queen of</hi> Sheba. <hi>And ſee what
glorious expreſſions Queen</hi> Heſter <hi>uſed to comfort the People of God,
which was the Church of God, as you may read in the book of</hi> Heſter,
<hi>which cauſed joy and gladneſs of heart among all the</hi> Jews, <hi>who prayed
and worſhiped the Lord in all places, who jeoparded her life contrary to
the Kings command, went and ſpoke to the King, in the wiſdom and
fear of the Lord, by which means ſhe ſaved the lives of the People of
God; and righteous</hi> Mordecai <hi>did not forbid her ſpeaking, but ſaid,</hi> If
ſhe held her peace, her and her Fathers houſe ſhould be deſtroyed; <hi>and herein
you blind Prieſts are contrary to Righteous</hi> Mordecai.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe you may read how <hi>Judith</hi> ſpoke, and what noble acts ſhe
did, and how ſhe ſpoke to the Elders of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Dear Brethren,
ſeeing ye are the honorable &amp; Elders of the People of God, call to remembrance
how our Fathers in time paſt were tempted, that they might be proved if they
would worſhip God aright; they ought alſo to remember how our Father</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
<hi>being tryed through manifold tribulations, was found a friend of
God; ſo was</hi> Iſaac, Jacob, <hi>and</hi> Moſes, <hi>and all they pleaſed God, and were
ſtedfaſt in Faith through manifold troubles.</hi> And read alſo her prayer in
the Book of <hi>Judith,</hi> and how the Elders commended her, and ſaid, <hi>All
that thou ſpeakeſt is true, and no man can reprove thy words, pray therefore
for us, for thou art an holy Woman, and feareſt God.</hi> So theſe Elders of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> did not forbid her ſpeaking, as you blind Prieſts do; yet you will
make a Trade of Womens words to get money by, and take Texts, and
Preach Sermons upon Womens words; and ſtill cry out, Women muſt
not ſpeak, Women muſt be ſilent; ſo you are far from the minds of the
Elders of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who praiſed God for a Womans ſpeaking. But the
<hi>Jezebel,</hi> and the Woman, the falſe Church, the great Whore, and tatling

               </gap>ſt is the Head of; ſuch VVomen as were in tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
under the Law, which are called a VVoman in the <hi>Revelations.</hi>
And ſee further how the wiſe VVoman cryed to <hi>Joah</hi> over the VVall,
and ſaved the City of <hi>Abel,</hi> as you may read, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. how in her

deſtroy the Inheritance of the Lord? Then went the Woman to the people in her wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and ſmote off the head of</hi> Sheba, <hi>that roſe up againſt</hi> David, <hi>the Lords Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
Then</hi> Joab <hi>blew the Trumpet, and all the people departed in peace.</hi> And this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance

But what Husbands have Widows to learn of, but Chriſt? And was not

               </gap> then? But <hi>Jezebel,</hi> and Tatlers, and the Whore that denies
Revelation and Propheſie, are not permitted, which will nor learn of Chriſt; and
they that be out of the Spirit and Power of Chriſt, that the Prophets were in,
who are in the Tranſgreſſion, are ignorant of the Scriptures; and ſuch are againſt
Womens Speaking, and Mens too, who Preach that which they have received of
the Lord God; but that which they have preached, and do preach, will come
over all your heads, yea, over the head of the falſe Church, the Pope; for the
Pope is the Head of the Falſe Church, and the Falſe Church is the Popes
Wife: and ſo he and they that be of him, and come from him, are againſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
ſpeaking in the True Church, when both he and the falſe Church are called
<hi>Woman,</hi> in <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. and ſo are in the Tranſgreſſion that would uſurp authority
over the Man Chriſt Jeſus, and his Wife too, and would not have him to Reign;
but the Judgement of the great Whore is come. But Chriſt, who is the Head of
the Church, the True Woman which is his Wife, in it do Daughters Propheſie;
who are above the Pope and his Wife, and a top of them; And here Chriſt is the
Head of the Male and Female, who may ſpeak; and the Church is called <hi>a Royal
Prieſthood;</hi> ſo the Woman muſt offer as well as the Man, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17. <hi>The Spirit
ſaith, Come, and the Bride ſaith, Come;</hi> and ſo is not the Bride the Church? and
doth the Church only conſiſt of Men? you that deny Womens Speaking, anſwer;
Doth it not conſiſt of Women as well as Men? Is not the Bride compared to the
whole Church? And doth not t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e Bride ſay, <hi>Come?</hi> Doth not the Woman ſpeak
then? the Husband, Chriſt Jeſus, the <hi>Amen;</hi> and doth not the falſe Church go
about to ſtop the Brides Mouth? But it is not poſſible for the Bridegroom is with
his Bride, and he opens her Mouth. Chriſt Jeſus, who goes on Conquering, and
to Conquer; who kills and ſlayes with the Sword, which is the words of his
Mouth; the Lamb and the Saints ſhall have the Victory, the true Speakers of
Men and Women over the falſe Speaker.</p>
