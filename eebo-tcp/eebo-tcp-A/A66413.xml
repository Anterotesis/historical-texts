         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PROTESTANT's ANSWER
TO THE
CATHOLICK LETTER
TO THE
SEEKER, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>HEre's a <hi>Catholick Letter to the Seeker, or a Reply to the
Protestant Answer to the Seeker.</hi> But what's become of
the <hi>Seeker</hi> himself, for this four Months past? What
of the <hi>Declaration</hi> he was in the Conclusion to make
for the <hi>Catholick Faith</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cath. Letter to a Seeker, p. 1. and 34.</note> which we are now told of?
That according to the method, it seems agreed on, he may, after
<hi>Sentence pass'd</hi> in this case, <hi>proceed to the Infallibility of the Church,
or other Points of Faith in difference betwixt them and the Church of</hi>
England; as our Author intimates there a little too early. The
<hi>Seeker</hi> had indeed given reason enough to judg on which side he
was to be satisfied: That tho seemingly he was sent out like the
Dove, to try where he might find rest for the Sole of his Foot,
yet we may see beforehand, what was the Ark he was to
return to; and that they were as sure of him, as they are of a
Convert before they offer a Conference. Where's now the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
he was to come to? Has the <hi>Protestant Answer to the
Seekers Request,</hi> broke these Measures, and forced them to think of
another Expedient? Our Author cannot altogether dissemble
it. It seems the <hi>Seeker</hi> was to put certain <hi>Ties</hi> upon his Answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
to which his Friend on the side of the Church of <hi>Rome
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62597:4"/>
submitted, and it was humbly conceived the Protestant Answerer would
have done so too,</hi> as our Author signifies, p. 1. But he being a
lover of Liberty more than Courtship; and of Truth, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
more than both, took upon himself, as its thought, too
much Authority, when together with his Answer to the <hi>Seekers
Request,</hi> he wrote a Reply to the <hi>Catholick Answer to the Seekers
Request.</hi> This is a course our Author complains of, and perhaps he
has some reason for it. But what has he to accuse the <hi>Protestant
Answerer</hi> of? That <hi>he has evaded the Question.</hi> As how? Of this
he gives a threefold Instance.</p>
            <p>1. That he has used the Word <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> Of this our
Author thus complains, <hi>p.</hi> 2. and 5. <hi>I do not find the word</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,
<hi>so much as mentioned in either your Request, or my
Answer. Wherefore, how sincere the Gentleman has been in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
let the World judg.</hi> A material Point! who would not
think now, that the word <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> was abominated by
him, and as little used in their Church, as it is in ours? It's fit
therefore to know our Authors mind in it. Of this he saith, <hi>It's
a word devised by the Church to express the Conversion that's made in the
Sacrauent,âand which mysterious change the Holy Catholick</hi> [the
Roman] <hi>Church doth properly call</hi> Transubstantiation, <hi>p.</hi> 2, and 5.
Now, where is the fault? Where the insincerity? The insinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
they may take to themselves; but the fault is, that when they
thought by the use of the Phrase, <hi>Real Presence,</hi> common to both
them and us, and by the forbearance of the word <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,</hi>
which is peculiar to themselves, that they might have
imposed upon the unwary Reader, the <hi>Protestant Answerer used the
word</hi> Transubstantiation for their Real Presence, and so their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
is discover'd, and in part defeated.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>He saith, The</hi> Protestant Answerer <hi>evaded the Question, when</hi>
instead of speaking to the <hi>Real Presence,</hi> he betook himself to <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,</hi>
p. 2. <hi>Now, who would not think upon this
charge, that his</hi> Real Presence <hi>and</hi> Transubstantiation, <hi>are as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
as Truth and Falshood? Here indeed he has put a Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which I confess I should have been ready to ask;</hi> What's
this to the purpose? Is not the <hi>Real Presence</hi> and <hi>Transubstantiation</hi>
all as one? p. 5. <hi>And I should be as ready to ask again, If they</hi>
are all as one, <hi>how was the Question evaded, when</hi> instead of
speaking to the <hi>Real Presence,</hi> the Answerer betook himself to <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation?
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62597:4"/>
In this, he thus acutely Answers.</hi> No truly,
they are not all as one, as you may think. For there is a great deal of
difference betwixt a Man, and the Name by which he is distinguished.â
'Tis one thing to prove the <hi>Real Presence,</hi> and being of Christs Body
and Blood in the Sacrament; and another to shew, why this change is
by the Church call'd <hi>Transubstantiation;</hi> tho whoever believes the one,
can't in Truth deny the other. <hi>That is, the</hi> Real Presence <hi>and</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,
<hi>are not</hi> all as one, <hi>because they are</hi> all as one: <hi>And
the</hi> Answerer <hi>has evaded the Question, by using the one for the
other, because</hi> whoever believes the one, can't in Truth deny the other.</p>
            <p>3. But he has not yet concluded the Charge. For saith he,
<hi>Whereas the Controversy is not about the word,</hi> the Answerer has
<hi>altogether banter'd at the word</hi> Transubstantiation, <hi>and not spoken to
the Substance,</hi> p. 5. So before, <hi>The</hi> Arians <hi>with as much reason might
have objected against the word</hi> Consubstantial <hi>(which was devised against
them) as the Protestant Answerer has done, where</hi> p. 3. he says,
<q>
                  <hi>That it's enough for them to shew that</hi> Transubstantiation <hi>is not
taught in Scripture, tho the Being of Christs Body and Blood in the
Sacrament is,</hi>â<bibl>p. 2.</bibl>
               </q> If our Author's skill in reasoning be no
better than it appears to be in Ecclesiastical History, his Adversary
has no great reason to fear him. That the word <hi>Consubstantial</hi>
was used against the <hi>Arians,</hi> I acknowledg; but that it was devised
against them (as our Author saith) is spoken at adventure. For the
contrary is evident that it was in use long before in the Christian
Church.<note place="margin">Eccl. Hist. l. 1. c. 8.</note> So saith <hi>Eusebius, We have known certain Learned and Famous
Bishops and Writers among the Ancients, who reasoning upon the Divinity
of the Father and Son, have used the word</hi> Consubstantial, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>.
But to return to the Charge; where is this Controversy managed in
the Answer about this unscriptural word <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> which
the Protestant Answerer <hi>altogether banter'd at?</hi> He has found it
out in somewhat that is not there; I shall here set down the
Words of the <hi>Answer,</hi> with his, and let's see how they agree,<table>

               </table>
            </p>
            <p>Where this Author is guilty of a double Perversion. First,
That he translates what is spoken of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to the Word (when there is not a Syllable that looks,
that way) and then, that he would represent the <hi>Real Presence</hi>
in the Protestant, that is a spiritual, Sense, to be an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>the Being of Christs Body and Blood in the Sacrament,</hi> in
their way.</p>
            <p>But after our Author has for some Pages entertain'd himself in
managing this imaginary dispute against his Adversary, yet in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
of himself he finds out another sort of matter that he is
obliged to consider, and if he can, to confute.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Protestant Answer</hi> consists of two Parts.</p>
            <p>In the first, are considered the Texts produced in the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Answer to the Seeker,</hi> to prove their <hi>Real Presence,</hi> which I
hope I may now call <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the second, There is given a Catalogue of such Texts, as
maintain the Protestant Doctrine of Christs Spiritual Presence,
and in Confutation of the Corporal Presence held in the Church
of <hi>Rome.</hi> And now let us view our Author's Undertaking, and
see how he has quitted himself in both of these.</p>

                  <head>PART I. Sect. 1</head>
                  <p>WE are to consider in the first place,<note place="margin">Part. 1. Sect. 1.</note> how our Author has
Vindicated his own Answer to the <hi>Seekers Request,</hi> and
what Reply there is made to the Objections and Arguments di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
against his pretended Proofs from Scripture.</p>
                  <p>In the entrance upon this matter, the <hi>Protestant Answerer</hi> sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested,
that the <hi>Seeker</hi> had put an unreasonable Task upon his
<hi>Catholick Priests,</hi> to prove their <hi>Real Presence,</hi> or <hi>Transubstantiation,
by the express Text, and plain Word of God;</hi> since Persons of the
greatest Note; for Quality and Learning, in their Church, have
freely given it up, and granted it to be a vain attempt. Such
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62597:5"/>
as <hi>Scotus</hi> and <hi>Biel,</hi> among the Schoolmen, and the Cardinals,
<hi>Alliaco, Fisher, Cajetan</hi> and <hi>Bellarmin.</hi> What saith our Author to
this?</p>
                  <p>First, saith he, Supposing it was so as these Authors say,
That <q>
                        <hi>there is not one place of Scripture so express, that without the
Determination of the Church, it would evidently compel a Man to
receive</hi> Transubstantiation.</q>â<hi>Yet the same might as well be said
of the Consubstantiality of the Son,</hi> p. 3. Will our Author venture
to say, there is no more from Scripture to prove the Consub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiality
of the Son, than there is to prove <hi>Transubstantiation?</hi>
Or hath he any heart to say it, after the publishing <hi>the Doctrine
of the Trinity and Transubstantiation compared,</hi> and as long as that
Book lies unanswered? But let that be as it will. <hi>What,</hi> saith
he, <hi>is this to the Being, or not Being of the Body and Blood of Christ in the
Sacrament? Had be produced</hi> Scotus, Bellarmin, <hi>&amp;c. to disprove
the</hi> Real Presence, <hi>it had been something, tho not to your purpose. For
the Request was to satisfie you by Scripture only, and not by citing our
Modern Divines,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but by the express Text,</hi> &amp;c. But I think it
was to the purpose to shew that some of the most Eminent in
their Church declare it is not to be proved in that way, and I
think to declare it cannot be proved, is little better than to <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At last our Author is content to yield up <hi>Scotus,</hi> one of his
<hi>Modern Divines,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmin;</hi> and he adds, <hi>if what they have said
in that matter, will do the Gentleman a kindness, he shall have it not
only from them, but all the Faithful.</hi> If so, I fear our Author then
will be left alone; for if <hi>all the Faithful</hi> are of the same mind
with <hi>Scotus</hi> and <hi>Bellarmin;</hi> then his Undertaking to prove
<hi>Transubstantiation</hi> by the <hi>express Texts of</hi> Scripture, will be a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Attempt. But we go too far, for that's to be understood
with a reserve, <hi>viz.</hi> Scripture <hi>without the Determination of the
Church is not so express,</hi> &amp;c. This premised, our Author cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proceeds, <hi>That altho the Scripture were never so plain, we would yet
submit to the Determination of the Church, for the true Sense and
Meaning thereof.</hi> So that tho he pleads Scripture, and would
fain find out somewhat that looks like an <hi>express Text;</hi> yet he
doth it not, nor would be understood, <hi>that he thereby renounced
the Determination of the Church.</hi> For whether the Scripture be
<hi>plain</hi> for it or not, is not the Foot this matter rests upon; and
<hi>altho it were never so plain,</hi> yet the Church is to give it the <hi>true
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62597:6"/>
meaning;</hi> and whatever meaning the Church gives it, that is the
<hi>true meaning;</hi> and so, if the Church had determined against <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,</hi>
as it has determined for it, there would have been
still express <hi>Texts,</hi> and the case had been alike resolved.</p>

                     <hi>p.</hi> 6.
The <hi>Catholick Answerer</hi> had produced two places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as his <hi>plain Texts</hi> for <hi>Transubstantiation;</hi> the first is, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 48. Here
the <hi>Protestant Answerer</hi> interposed, and first directed the <hi>Seeker,</hi>
where he might find about thirty Writers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church,
who reject that Text as not serving to our <hi>Author</hi>'s purpose,
<hi>Pag.</hi> 4. and then proceeds to shew for what reasons they and
we do so reject it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. As it had no special reference to the Sacrament; and
that for two Reasons: 1. Because this Discourse of our Saviour
was delivered above a year before, <hi>ver.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>To this first our Author replies,</p>
                  <p>That the fourth Verse, <hi>[The Passover, a Feast of the Jews, was
nigh] is no Rule to shew the Sacrament was not instituted above a year
after.</hi> For, saith he, <hi>that this word</hi> Nigh <hi>should signifie above a year
after, is such a Figure as never was:</hi> And so gravely repairs to his
Concordance to prove the word <hi>Nigh</hi> is <hi>not by express and plain
Scripture to be taken for above a year after.</hi> Certainly there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
more need of <hi>express and plain Scripture,</hi> when men cannot look
a Chapter or two before them. For would any one that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
in the Gospels, think that St. <hi>John</hi> here, and St. <hi>Luke 22.
1.</hi> must needs speak of the same Passover, because St. <hi>Luke hath
the same word, Now the Feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is
call'd the Passover.</hi> I see our Author wants here a little informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Let him therefore turn to <hi>Chap. 7. v. 2, &amp;</hi> 14. and he will find
a Feast of Tabernacles; and go on to <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. 1. and he will
find another Passover. Now I hope I need not acquaint him that
these two Feasts of the Tabernacles and Passover were kept in
different Months, and that the same Passover could not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and after the Feast of Tabernacles; and consequently, it
must be a year betwixt the Passover, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 4. and that <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 1.
and as much <hi>above a year</hi> betwixt our Saviour's Discourse, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.
and the Passover, as that was before the approaching Passover that
was said to be <hi>Nigh.</hi>

                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:62597:6"/>
2. <hi>The</hi> Protestant Answerer <hi>proceeded to shew that this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of our Saviour had no special reference to the Sacrament,
because</hi> the eating the Flesh, and drinking the Blood here spoken of, might
be out of the Sacrament as well as in it, and at that present as well as
a year after. <hi>This he proved from</hi> Vers. 53, 54, 56, 57. <hi>In all
which the present time is still spoken of,</hi> Except ye eat. He that eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
âMy flesh is meat.</p>
                  <p>To this our Author replies:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To say,</hi> That the flesh of Christ may be eaten out of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and even before it was instituted, &amp;c. is indeed such a Figure,
as none but himself can unriddle, <hi>p.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I answer, But to say (as he doth)</hi> that Christ would give us bread
to eat in the Sacrament, which should be the very same flesh which he
would, and afterwards did give for the life of the world, <hi>that is, that
he should give it before it was given, is a</hi> Figure <hi>I doubt our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>
himself <hi>cannot</hi> unriddle; <hi>who saith again, that</hi> before he gave
it, 'twas impossible for them to eat it; <hi>but he gave it not, till he
gave it on the Cross.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(2) But to say that the Flesh of Christ <hi>here spoken of</hi> (an Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
our Author left out) might be eaten out of the Sacrament,
as well as in it, is no Riddle, if it be true. And it is true if
our Saviour spoke here of his Flesh that might be, and was then
to be eaten, at the same time as he spoke it, by all those that
were then his present Auditors; as the Answerer proved from
verses 53, 54, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To this our Author opposes</hi> vers. 5. The Bread which I will give
is my flesh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where, <hi>saith he,</hi> Christ promised, and told them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that be would (in the Future Tense) give them bread to eat, which
should be the very same flesh, which he would, and afterwards did, give
for the life of the world. <hi>Whence he infers,</hi> If the bread which he in
the Sacrament gives us to eat, saying, Take, Eat, This is my Body, be
not that Bread which he promised he would give us to eat, pray ask
your Protestant Answerer, where, when, and how did Christ give us
Bread to eat, which should be his flesh, if this be not? <hi>Pag. 7. What
is a little out of its place, in our Author, I have here laid toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that I may give it its full force:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I answer:</p>
                  <p>1. I readily own with our Author, that the words, <hi>I will give,</hi>
contain a promise, but then we differ about the time when they
were fulfilled. He saith, they refer to his <hi>last Supper, when he took
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62597:7"/>
Bread,</hi> &amp;c. under the <hi>Forms of Bread and Wine.</hi> But now if I am
examined upon the <hi>Where,</hi> the <hi>When,</hi> and the <hi>How,</hi> I should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it to the Cross; and that because of the following words,
<hi>The Bread which I will give is my Flesh, which I will give for the life
of the world.</hi> For he gave not his Flesh <hi>for the life of the world</hi> in the
Sacrament<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> but after the institution of that, on the Cross; not
under the <hi>Forms of Bread and Wine,</hi> but in his own proper <hi>Form,</hi>
and visible to the Spectators. The reason of his mistake seems
to be, that he reads the Future Tense after this manner, our
Saviour <hi>told them that he would give them Bread to eat, which should
be his Flesh.</hi> Where he is guilty of two over-sights. First, that
he applies that to the Future which is spoken of the Present, for
he reads it <hi>should be his Flesh,</hi> as if it was first Bread, and then
was to be Flesh, to put the better colour upon their Doctrine of
<hi>Transubstantiation;</hi> whereas our Saviour saith, the Bread <hi>is my
Flesh,</hi> which is directly against it; and if it signifies any thing of
that nature, would rather prove that his Flesh should be Bread.
For it's not said, the Bread which I will give shall be my Flesh,
but rather that which is my Flesh, I will give to be Bread.</p>
                  <p>2. He alters the Terms of the Text, for the words are, <hi>Which
I will give for the life of the world;</hi> and he reads them, <hi>Which I
will give them to Eat:</hi> as if the promise refer'd only to the Bread
which they should eat; and not to the Flesh which was to be
given for the world. So that we see what's like to become of
his Question, he prays his <hi>Seeker</hi> to ask his Protestant Answerer,
viz. <hi>Where, When and How did Christ give us Bread to eat which
should be his Flesh, if this be it not</hi> in the Sacrament? For he must
frame his Question anew, if he would have it to the purpose;
and must read St. <hi>John</hi> again (notwithstanding what he saith he
has done on <hi>this occasion,</hi> Pag 8.) and whatever he found before,
I am apt to think after this little light given to him, he will not
find those words in this Chapter, <hi>He would give them Bread to eat,
which should be his Flesh.</hi> And if he reads the <hi>Protestant Answer</hi>
again, he will find no occasion for those words, <hi>Where,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>if
this be it not?</hi> For the <hi>Answerer</hi> did not except the Sacrament,
and say the eating the Flesh, and drinking the Blood here spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, could not be in the Sacrament, but that it might be out
of the Sacrament as well as in it; intimating thereby that it was
not to be understood in a sense peculiar to the Sacrament, but
in a sense common to that and other Offices of Religion; and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62597:7"/>
that <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>drinking</hi> were (as he shew'd) but other words
for <hi>coming</hi> and <hi>believing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. <hi>But our Author has a further reserve, and offers at a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Exposition of those Phrases, I suppose it's (in his phrase.</hi> p. 2.)
his private meaning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>v. 53, &amp;c.</hi> Except ye eat,âhe that eateth. Not,
<hi>saith he,</hi> that he did then give, or that they did then eat his Flesh, and
drink his Blood, which they could not do before he took it, blessed it,
brake it, and gave it. For at that time when he spake this, he only told
them he would give it, and the Eve before his Passion, he performed it.
And from that time I suppose the Obligation bears force, <hi>ver.</hi> 53. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
ye eat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will suppose that the Present doth not here exclude the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and that he that <hi>eateth my Flesh, and drinketh my Blood hath
Eternal life,</hi> will always hold true, and what all ages as well as
those then present would partake of; but methinks it's very
hard to make the present exclude it self, and to tell us that
<hi>they did not, and could not then eat the Flesh of Christ,</hi> when our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
saith they might and ought, as is evident from what follows.</p>
                  <p>Let us go to the <hi>thing</hi> to be eaten, and it's represented in the
Present Tense, <hi>v.</hi> 51. This <hi>is</hi> the Bread. <hi>v.</hi> 51. I <hi>am</hi> the Bread.
<hi>v. 52. Is</hi> my Flesh. <hi>v.</hi> 55. My Flesh <hi>is</hi> meat.</p>
                  <p>Let us go to the <hi>act,</hi> and in correspondence to the object, it's
also in the present, <hi>v.</hi> 51. If any man <hi>eat.</hi> Thus the <hi>Jews</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
it, <hi>v.</hi> 52. How can this man <hi>give</hi> us his Flesh to eat?
And accordingly our Saviour answers, <hi>v.</hi> 53. Except ye <hi>eat,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>ye have</hi> no life in you. He speaks it to those present, <hi>ye;</hi> and then
applies it universally, <hi>v. 54. Whoso eateth my Flesh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Let us go to the thing signified by Eating and Drinking, and
it's after the same manner, <hi>v.</hi> 35. He that <hi>cometh,</hi> and he that
<hi>believeth, v.</hi> 38, 40, 45, 47.</p>
                  <p>I shall conclude this with what was said in the <hi>Protestant An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</hi>
If Christ's Flesh here spoken of, might be eaten, and his
Blood drank out of the Sacrament, then it could not here be
understood of that Flesh and Blood which our Author saith the
Bread and Wine are converted into in the Sacrament; nor, I may
add, of <hi>carnal</hi> eating his Flesh, and drinking his Blood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Our Author resents this ill, for he saith,</hi> As to his carnal ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
we beg his pardon, if he means as we eat Beef, and other Meats.
For that we truly and really receive the Body and Blood of Christ (to use
his own words) after an Heavenly and Spiritual manner; We should
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62597:8"/>
agree, did we not differ in this, that they receive it in Figure and Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
only, and we receive it in Substance and Truth, <hi>Pag.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>Here I acknowledg I intended no hurt in the world, but
thought I had exprest my self innocently enough. For when I
had read in the <hi>Catholick Answer,</hi> that <hi>in the<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> Eucharist is Truly,
Really, and Substantially contained under the Forms of Bread and Wine,
the True Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus in the very Substance wherein
he was born of the Virgin, and wherein he lived and died for us, with
this difference only, that he was visible to the eye of Flesh then, and
invisible to the same now.</hi> I thought the word <hi>carnal</hi> was expressive
of the thing, and indeed I find no great reason to alter it: For,
1. had I said <hi>Metaphorically</hi> and <hi>Figuratively,</hi> that by no means
would suit what is corporal. And besides, I learn too from our
Author, <hi>Pag.</hi> 17. that that is a <hi>deceitful, fictious</hi> manner. 2. Had
I said <hi>corporal,</hi> I see little distance betwixt that and carnal; for as
Body and Flesh is all one, so is corporal and carnal. 3. Had I
chosen the word <hi>Spiritual,</hi> that's a kind of contradiction, if ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to a Body; for Spiritual eating of a Body is little better
than bodily eating of a spirit. And when a <hi>Real Presence by Faith</hi>
would not content them, if <hi>we deny a Real Presence by sense,
Seeker,</hi> Pag. 6. I had as much reason to believe a Spiritual eating
would be no more allowed than a Spiritual Presence. 4. Had
I express'd it by <hi>Heavenly,</hi> when it was somewhat eaten and
drank corporally, and that what we took with the mouth was
the very Body of Christ, it could not be sufficiently expressive
of it.</p>
                  <p>It was further urged,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. Upon mature Consideration of the whole, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
to the <hi>Protestant Answerer,</hi> that the sense of Eating the Flesh
of Christ in this place must be Figurative, and signifies no other
than <hi>coming</hi> to Christ, and <hi>Believing</hi> in him; which sure is out of
the Sacrament, as well as in it. And this indeed he proved
from the promiscuous use of the words in that Chapter; but
this our Author conceals from his Reader, that he might not
too apparently contradict what he had said, <hi>Pag.</hi> 2. That <hi>he
says (by no Authority but his own) that the sense of Eating the Flesh,
must be Figurative; and right or wrong they are Figurative,</hi> upon <hi>his</hi>
own <hi>bare word,</hi> without Scripture.</p>
                  <p>But as the <hi>Protestant Answerer</hi> argued from the words and
phrases of the Chapter, so from the current of our Saviour's
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62597:8"/>
Discourse, that it could not be properly and literally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</p>
                  <p>(1.) Because then all that properly Eat the Flesh of Christ,
would according to our Saviour's promise, <hi>v. 54. Have Eternal
Life; Whoso Eateth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>To this our Author answers, <hi>Very truel</hi> but with a qualification
that recalls what he had granted. For it's to be understood,
saith he, of <hi>Worthy Receivers.</hi> But this is by no means consistent
with our Saviour's Reasoning, which if the Flesh to be eat, and
the Eating of it were to be understood properly, will necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
infer the Salvation of all such as thus <hi>Eat</hi> after this manner;
as well unworthy as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â¢â¢</desc>
                     </gap>worthy. Since all that Eat his Flesh, and
drink his Blood, in the sense there meant, are the persons to
whom Eternal Life is promised; but if properly Eating his Flesh
be the sense of our Saviour's Expressions there us'd, then we
know what follows.</p>
                  <p>2. The <hi>Protestant Answerer</hi> urged further, That if the words
<hi>Eating the Flesh,</hi> and <hi>Drinking the Blood,</hi> be properly to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
then the Receiving the Sacrament in both Kinds will be
necessary to Salvation; it being affirmed, <hi>v. 53. Except ye eat the
Flesh of the Son of man, and drink his Blood, ye have no life in you;</hi>
and he shewed that for this reason, amongst others, Cardinal
<hi>Cajetan</hi> would not admit that this Discourse of our Saviour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
to the Eucharist.</p>
                  <p>What saith our Author to this? Truly nothing. <hi>As to this,</hi>
saith he, <hi>of both kinds, it doth not properly relate either to your request,
or my Answer.</hi> A Reply that may be made in any case.</p>
                  <p>He goes on, <hi>And besides, I do not see where the necessity lies of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining
the Sacrament in both Kinds to one that believes<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> it in neither.</hi>
That is, as much as to say, I beg his pardon, I will not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
an Answer to such an one as he is; but however, methinks
he might have said somewhat, if it had been only for the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of the distressed <hi>Seeker,</hi> to whom he writes his <hi>Letter;</hi> to
let him see that there is no consequence in this Argument. It
puzled Cardinal <hi>Cajetan,</hi> a man of sense and sagacity; and surely
the <hi>Seeker</hi> may then be led away by the error of it, and it may
put off his <hi>Declaration for the Catholick Faith</hi> four Months longer.
But there is no danger, it was not necessary to one that doth not
believe; but he declares he <hi>is ready to satisfie his Seeker,</hi> that is,
one that doth believe, as we may conceive.</p>

                     <hi>I know not whether this may not have put our Author a
little out of humour, for he cannot but</hi> abhor, <hi>he saith,</hi> to see
men mould Gods Word into what Form they please, and make every
thing a Figure, that doth not square with their Fancy. Is it because
our Saviour spake some things by way of Parable, that all he said was
such? Or that he never spake otherwise? How comes it that mean Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities
are (by the Church of St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s) left to themselves, to judg
of the true sense of Scripture, according to <hi>D. T.</hi> who tells you in his
<hi>True Account of a Conference,</hi> 
                     <q>That a man after using all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Means, and the help of all Ministerial Guides possible, must at
last judg for himself.âA special Assertion indeed! Which if
true, what need of Teachers? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
                        <bibl>Pag. 10<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
                        </bibl>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how doth he <hi>mould</hi> the Word of God into what <hi>Form</hi> he
pleases, that understands that Figuratively which was Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
spoken? And to whom doth our Author speak when he
thus Expostulates, <hi>Is it because our Saviour spake some things by way
of Parable, that all he said was such?</hi> Had he no other way to get
clear of his Adversary, but to fix this upon him? And had he
no other way to meet with those that plead for the perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity
of Scripture, but to tell the world, that they own our
Saviour <hi>never spake otherwise than in Parables?</hi> How mean and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
is this? But however this was a fair occasion as he
thought to make a <hi>special</hi> Remarque upon the Doctrine taught
<hi>by the Church of St. Martin's.</hi> Now here the <hi>Protestant Answerer</hi>
is more immediately concerned as a Parishioner (though one
of the <hi>Mean Capacities</hi> there <hi>taught)</hi> and would fain see how our
Author would manage himself in a debate upon that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
especially when after his Exclamation against it, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
is forced to acknowledg the reasonableness of it. For if a
man <hi>must</hi> not <hi>at last judg for himself;</hi> or if so, that there will be
no <hi>need of Teachers;</hi> then it's in vain to send <hi>Answers</hi> and <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
to a <hi>Seeker,</hi> and to propose Texts to his Examination: And
yet in this <hi>special</hi> way doth our Author proceed from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the end of his <hi>Letter.</hi> He leaves it to his <hi>Seeker</hi> to <hi>pass
sentence upon what has been said by either</hi> party, <hi>Pag. 1. Whether,</hi> saith
he, <hi>this hath any reference, be you the Judg. Pag.</hi> 7, 13. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
him <hi>to consult the words, and see whether those Texts do imply,
&amp;c.</hi> Pag. 8. <hi>Seriously to distinguish and peruse the Texts, Pag.</hi> 33. So
that it seems this <hi>special Assertion</hi> ought to be one of his own,
who teaches his <hi>Seeker</hi> so far, after the same way <hi>as mean Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities
are taught by the Church at St.</hi> Martin<hi>'s.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:62597:9"/>
To come to a close of this Argument; the <hi>Protestant Answerer</hi>
the better to represent his Adversaries weakness in decrying <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
and Parables,</hi> shewed him how this Discourse of our Saviour so
abounded in them, that there were no less than twenty expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of that kind in it; and accordingly drew out several of them
for our Author to try his skill upon, and to resolve them <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Figure,</hi> Pag. 8. First, saith he, <hi>Let the Catholick Answerer
tell me without a Figure, what is that meat which endures to Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Life?</hi> Here our Author labours hard to prove that the meat
in <hi>v.</hi> 27. is the Bread and Flesh, <hi>v.</hi> 51. and concludes, <hi>which</hi>
Flesh, <hi>without a Figure, I humbly conceive is that meat which endureth
unto Everlasting Life.</hi> But I as humbly conceive he has not reach'd
the point; for granting the Meat, the Bread, and the Flesh
to be one and the same, yet how is the Flesh of Christ Bread
and Meat without a Metaphor, when it's only spiritually and
not Corporally Eaten, as he saith, and when neither capable of
digestion, nor we of nourishment by it? Again, if this be Eaten
only in the Sacrament, how can it under the Form of Bread
endure to Everlasting Life, or how can it be Meat that thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures,
when it is not to be Eaten in Heaven, and all Sacraments
and Institutions cease?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The other Questions were.</hi> How the Son was sealed by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
How Jesus is Bread, and the Bread that came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?
How the Bread and the Flesh of Christ could be the same? <hi>v.</hi> 57.
And if the same, how it could come from Heaven, when he was of the
Seed of <hi>David,</hi> according to the Flesh? How one of his Church can
talk of a literal Sense of, [except <hi>ye drink his Blood],</hi> which denies the
Cup to the Laity?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To all these our Author returns a general Answer,</hi> As to his,
How the Son was sealed by the Father, and the rest of his <hi>How's?</hi>
they are such <hi>Jewish</hi> Expressions, as that all Christian pretenders ought
to be ashamed of them. So the <hi>Jews</hi> said, <hi>v.</hi> 52. How can this man
give us his Flesh to eat? So <hi>Jewish</hi> it is to question God, how he could
do it? How this? How that? <hi>And so he runs on to the Creation,
and Incarnation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I am a little at a loss here, to what cause
our Authors mistake is to be assign'd? Surely he could not but
understand that the</hi> How <hi>relates not to the manner, How these
things be? But, how these things could be thus applied to our
Saviour without a Figure? I am afraid that he saw the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and so slipt away from it; for else, why should he answer
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62597:10"/>
directly to the first Query, which would more plausibly bear it;
and indirectly and fraudulently to the rest? And yet, as if he
had to a Demonstration proved what he had undertaken, and
effectually confuted his Adversary, he will still have the words
express and plain, without a Figure. For thus he concludes,
p. 11. If</hi> these express and plain words of Christ be a Figure, where
he says as plain, as plain can be, that <hi>he would give us Bread to
eat, which should be his Flesh, [but which I have shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
he did not say.]</hi> I say, if these words are Figurative, and must
not be properly understood, I see no Reasen, why the whole Bible should not
be a Figure too. For if ever Christ was plain in any thing, 'twas in
this; especially in a Point, wherein there was never more occasion to
expound, if a Figure, than when the <hi>Jews</hi> (to whom he came) mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured
and said, How can this man give us his Flesh to eat? And
when some of the Disciples said it was an hard saying, and thereupon
walked no more with him. He that, in cases of less moment always
explain'd his Parables, should yet be Dark and Figurative in this of
that Importance, and which he well foresaw, occasions our differences at
this day; it would be contrary to his Wisdom and Goodness. But so
far was Christ from this, that he confirms it, <hi>v.</hi> 53. With a verily,
verily, except ye eat the Flesh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have transcribed this the more at large, because it contains
some things very peculiar, and is indeed the utmost force of what
he hath for his Defence.</p>
                  <p>I Answer to this.</p>
                  <p>1. In General, it's manifest, That our Saviour is not literally
plain; since it's acknowledg'd that his Discourse is Figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative,
from <hi>ver.</hi> 32. to <hi>ver.</hi> 51. And is it not strange, that
when he had so long discours'd after that manner, that yet in
one verse, he should mean literally, and which if literally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
would be so manifest a Contradiction to the Sense and
Reason of Mankind, that if he had literally said he was <hi>Bread,</hi> he
could not have more astonished them, than when he said, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
ye eat the Flesh of the Son of Man,</hi> &amp;c. if properly and lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
to be understood.</p>
                  <p>2. Whereas he saith our Saviour always explain'd his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles;
that is too largely spoken. For even those, which he chuses
out of <hi>Mark</hi> 3. 10, 13, 31, were not expounded to the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;
and if his Argument signify any thing, must therefore be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62597:10"/>
properly understood by them. But why did not he propound
the case in Dispute, and give us a like instance in figurative and
metaphorical Expressions; Such as our Saviour uses in this
Chapter? For, are <hi>Sealing, Hungring,</hi> &amp;c. to be understood
properly, because it's not said, that they are to be understood Figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
Nay, are eating his <hi>Flesh,</hi> and drinking his <hi>Blood,</hi> to
be understood properly? Then certainly, the <hi>Capernaits</hi> were in
the right, that thought our Saviour spoke of <hi>carnal</hi> Eating,
which yet our Author will not allow.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>He saith,</hi> There was never more occasion to expound, if a Figure,
than when the <hi>Jews</hi> murmured, and some of his Disciples went away;
and what he saw, occasions our Differences.</p>
                  <p>(1.) As for the <hi>murmuring</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> there was no such
<hi>occasion</hi> for our Saviour's expounding it; For thus also they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured,
because that Christ said, <hi>I am the Bread that came down
from Heaven,</hi> v. 41. And yet, tho he took notice of it, <hi>ver.</hi> 43.
he thought not himself concerned to explain his meaning, where
there might be more reason for their mistake, than there could
be in this. Indeed our Saviour look'd upon them as an obstinate
and intractable sort of People, and so did purposely conceal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
often, as was observed before, <hi>Mark</hi> 13. And this we
are not without some light in, in the case before us. For this
Discourse of his, was in the Synagogue, <hi>v.</hi> 59. and they were
the same People that before were offended and cavilled, <hi>ver.</hi> 41, 52.
And therefore our Saviour left them in the Dark, tho after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
when his Disciples murmured, <hi>v.</hi> 60, 61, 63. he tells
them, it was spiritually to be understood.</p>
                  <p>(2.) As for those Disciples, it doth not appear, that they
<hi>walked no more with him,</hi> because they were offended at his say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
(for that he explain'd it to them) but because he gave an
Intimation that he discovered their insincerity, <hi>v. 64. There are
some of you that believe not;</hi> and it follows, <hi>From that time many of
his Disciples went back,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>(3.) Neither was there any such occasion for our Saviour's
expounding himself <hi>from our differences;</hi> If he had meant it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
I grant <hi>there could never be more occasion,</hi> because it's a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
so contrary to the Sense and Reason of Mankind; but when
it's not so explain'd, the Sense and Reason of Mankind may be
thought a sufficient Security against mistake. And there might
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62597:11"/>
be as much reason for our Saviour to expound himself, when he
saith, he is <hi>Bread,</hi> a <hi>Door,</hi> a <hi>Vine,</hi> a <hi>Rock.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But all this while, our Author supposes our Saviour not to
have explain'd himself. I grant it, he did not do it on their side;
but I think he has done it to all attentive and unprejudiced
minds; if they will either consult the foregoing part of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
where he speaks of himself, under the Allusions of
<hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Flesh, v.</hi> 33, 35, 48, 51. and of believing in him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the the Metaphors of <hi>Coming</hi> and <hi>Eating, v. 35, 36, 47, 51,
60,</hi> 61, 62. or if they consult the Conclusion, <hi>v.</hi> 63. where he tells
his offended Disciples, <hi>It's the Spirit that quickneth,</hi> &amp;c. As if he
had said, The eating my <hi>Flesh,</hi> and drinking my <hi>Blood,</hi> which I
propound to you, is not as those cavilling <hi>Jews</hi> did misconstrue
it; and as you, I perceive, mistake; for in that <hi>Flesh,</hi> I am to
ascend into Heaven; but it's the heeding and obeying my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
the receiving my Doctrine, and believing in me as your
Redeemer, that I require, and you are to regard. And indeed,
thus St. <hi>Peter</hi> understood him, who concludes almost in the same
words, <hi>Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of Eternal
Life. And we believe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>v.</hi> 68, 69.</p>
                  <p>4. He saith, That <hi>Christ was so far from meaning otherwise than
plainly, as he spake, that to the murmuring Jews he confirms it,</hi> v. 53.
<hi>with a Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Whereas in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
be explained himself to them.</hi> That is, our Saviour meant plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
because he did not explain himself. But, saith he, <hi>he confirmed
it.</hi> What did he confirm? Did he confirm the Literal sense?
That he did not before give, and so could not confirm. Or
doth the Repetition of it without Explication shew it to be the
Literal sense? That he contends for. But then by parity of
reason our Saviour meant properly, when he said, <hi>I am the
Door.</hi> For it's there said in confirmation of what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
<hi>Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the Door,</hi> Joh. 10. 1, 7.
But why did our Saviour repeat it? Without doubt to shew
that he spoke it not inconsiderately; and if I add, to explain
what he before said, it's not without somewhat in the Text to
countenance it. For before he spoke of himself under the notion
of Flesh, <hi>v.</hi> 51, 52. but then of <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> to intimate both
the violence and manner of his Death; which he did usually
speak with more caution and reserve about.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:62597:11"/>
If we reflect upon what has been said, we see how unwarily
(I am loth to add more) our Author delivers himself, when he
saith, <hi>If these words are Figurative, I see no reason why the whole
Bible should not be a Figure too.</hi> And <hi>if ever Christ was plain in any
thing, it was in this.</hi> And, which I cannot recite without some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation;
<hi>Should he explain himself in matters of less weight, and
yet be dark in this great concern, is what would be contrary to his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and goodness,</hi> p. 10, 11. So that there shall be no sense or
perspicuity in Scripture, nor wisdom and goodness in our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
if their Doctrine be not his, and he be not of the same
mind with them.</p>
                  <p>Indeed after all our Author's confidence in this matter, and
his questioning all things, if this be questioned: he determines
that which the greatest Authority in his Church, the Council
of <hi>Trent,</hi> would not determine. For when it had been sharply
debated for and against these words being understood of the
Eucharist, it was at last agreed for the satisfaction of both sides,
neither to affirm nor deny it, and to yield to those that deni'd
it, that they had Fathers and Doctors on their side. And thus
the Council concludes; <hi>However that Discourse</hi> (of our Saviour's,
<hi>Joh. 6.) be understood according to the divers Interpretations of the
Holy Fathers and Doctors,</hi> Sess 21. c. 1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Here our Author takes a great leap from</hi> Pag. 9. <hi>of the</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
<hi>to</hi> Pag. 22. <hi>but because it's not amiss, I shall follow him:
The</hi> Protestant Answerer <hi>put it to them</hi> to give as plain Letter of
Scripture to prove Christ was neither a Door, Rock, nor Vine, as he
could that he was all Three: Or that all Christians are not turn'd into
Christ's Natural Body, when it's said <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 20. We are members
of his Body. <hi>This he did to shew that the Phrases,</hi> Eating the
Flesh, <hi>and,</hi> This is my Body, <hi>were not of themselves sufficient to
enforce us to take them in a proper sense; since it's no more
plainly said,</hi> Except ye eat the Flesh, <hi>&amp;c. and,</hi> This is my Body;
<hi>than it's said,</hi> I am the Door, The Vine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now what course doth our Author take to assoil this? <hi>Let's
see,</hi> saith he, <hi>whether the parity 'twixt I am the Door, The Vine,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>be the same with, The Bread is my Flesh, and, This is my Body, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ever explaining a Syllable to the contrary.</hi> Here he is a little too
forward. For he is to remember that the thing requir'd is to
give as <hi>plain Scripture to prove that Christ was neither a Door, nor
Vine,</hi> &amp;c. as there is for it. He knows who said it, <hi>I will prove the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62597:12"/>
Catholick Doctrine of the Real Presence, and I defie the world to prove the
contrary.</hi> Cath. Answ. to the Seeker, <hi>Pag.</hi> 1. and that declares again,
<hi>It's impossible to bring one Text out of the whole Bible to prove that the
Body and Blood of Christ is not in the Sacrament,</hi> Cath. Letter, <hi>Pag.
24.</hi> If now he so expects, then it may be so expected from him,
that he should prove the Negative, and that by as plain a Text
he should shew Christ is not a <hi>Door</hi> or <hi>Vine,</hi> as we can shew that
he is. I must confess I put him upon a Ridiculous Task, but who
can help it, it's in his own way. But to leave this trifling, let
us return to <hi>see</hi> his <hi>parity;</hi> though I doubt we shan't much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
our selves. As for the <hi>Door,</hi> he saith, <hi>The Text tells us it was
a Parable,</hi> Joh. 10. 6. <hi>This Parable spake Jesus. Wherefore if the
Protestant Answerer would be so kind, as to produce plain Scripture for
this of the Sacrament's being a Figure, as I have done for the Door's
being a Parable, he'l certainly gain a Proselyte of me.</hi> As for gaining
him a Proselyte by <hi>plain</hi> Scripture, I have reason to despair, who
declares beforehand that <hi>though the Scripture were never so plain, he
would yet submit to thi Determination of the Church,</hi> Pag. 4. But
where is this <hi>plain Scripture for the Door's being a Parable?</hi> He
points to the verse. But what was the Parable he spoke? It's in
the Verses foregoing about a <hi>Door,</hi> I grant; But not of Christ's
being the Door; for that follows after, <hi>Ver. 7. Then said Jesus
unto them again, Verily, verily, I am the Door.</hi> So that if he keeps
to his own way <hi>without explaining a Syllable,</hi> he is where he was,
and Christ may be as properly a door, as we may properly Eat
the Flesh of Christ.</p>
                  <p>He goes on: <hi>In like manner of the Vine, Christ saith,</hi> Joh. 15. 1.
<hi>I am the true Vine, and my Father is the Husbandman, as</hi> Mat. 20. 1.
<hi>when he likened the Kingdom of Heaven to an Housholder; and so goes
on explaining the same,</hi> ver. 4. <hi>As the Branch cannot,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Which if
you read the Chapter, you'l find to be more plain.</hi> I perceive he is very
serious, and I am of his mind, if the <hi>Seeker</hi> read on, he would
find it <hi>plain,</hi> that Christ is not properly a Vine, and so say I, if
he reads <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. he would find it as plain, that Eating the Flesh
of Christ is not properly to be understood. But if words will
oblige us without attending the sense, and we must take them
as we find them <hi>without explaining a Syllable,</hi> then I say still it's
as plainly said, <hi>I am the true Vine, as my Flesh is meat indeed;</hi> and
according to our Author's way of Exposition, this can be no
Parable. For, saith he, <hi>you'l find in all cases Christ spake not by Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62597:12"/>
without telling them it was so,</hi> Pag. 12. But here it's not so
said; for as before, so after the words, <hi>v. 4. As the Branch,</hi> &amp;c.
he saith, <hi>v. 5. I am the Vine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He goes on: <hi>In like manner of the Rcck, That he was the Corner-stone,
upon which the Foundation was laid,</hi> &amp;c. But how doth he
prove Christ was not properly a Rock according to his own
way? Because, saith he, he is a Corner-stone, and a Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is just as if he had been asked, how he would prove,
<hi>without explaining a Syllable,</hi> Christ is not properly a Corner-stone,
or a Foundation; and he should say, because he is a <hi>Rock.</hi>
But what saith he to the last Instance, to <hi>prove as plainly, Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
are not turned into Christ's Natural Body, when it's said we are
members of his Body,</hi> Ephes. 5. 20? To this an Answer is to be
expected.</p>
                  <p>Well, after all his windings and turnings, his <hi>Parities,</hi> and
<hi>without explainings,</hi> and his <hi>reading,</hi> and his in <hi>like manners,</hi> and
his Rules for understanding Parables, the words are as <hi>plain</hi>
and <hi>express</hi> that Christ is a <hi>Door,</hi> a <hi>Vine,</hi> a <hi>Rock,</hi> and we are <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Christ's Body,</hi> as they are that we <hi>Eat the Flesh of Christ;</hi>
and if one be properly to be understood, there is as much
reason from the meer words for the like understanding the
other.</p>
                  <p>After this Digression, our Author undertakes the last Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Protestant Answerer,</hi> viz.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. Here is nothing of the Conversion of the Bread in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Body of Christ; but rather the contrary; for if the
words are Literally to be understood, then they would rather
infer the conversion of Christ's Flesh and Blood into Bread and
Wine, when he saith, <hi>I am the Bread of Life,</hi> v. 5. <hi>My Flesh is
meat</hi> (or Bread) <hi>indeed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the first, which is the conversion of the Bread into the
Body of Christ, and the chief thing proposed to him, he
hath silently past it over; perhaps he saw here also <hi>no necessity of
defining</hi> or proving <hi>it to one that believes it not.</hi> But to make up
this defect he gives his Adversary a grave Reprimend, that
<hi>when he had just before said, that these words had no special Reference
to the Sacrament, he should now so apply them, by an odd way of
shufflng.</hi> And why did he not as sharply admonish him for offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to shew that the words might infer the conversion of Christ's
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62597:13"/>
Flesh into Bread? For both alike belonged to him. Our Author
it seems apprehended not all this was <hi>Argumentum ad hominem.</hi>
But how doth he clear the Point, and shew they infer no such
conversion? First he saith, <hi>for proof whereof,</hi> [That Christ's Flesh
is not turn'd into Bread] <hi>let us go to the words of Conversion, This
is my Body.</hi> But, methinks, it would have better became him to
have first proved the Conversion of the Bread into Flesh from
these words. As for St. <hi>John,</hi> he grants that had the words
been, <hi>My Flesh is Bread indeed,</hi> as his Adversary <hi>would fain have
them, then he would have something on his side.</hi> But if that be the
sense of it, and the words Bread and Meat are used by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>viour
promiscuously; then it's so far acknowledged. And for
that I shall refer our Author to <hi>v.</hi> 26, 27. but he will not allow
<hi>v.</hi> 48. to look that way, nor indeed will I. But yet they will as
soon prove Christ turned into Bread, as the words <hi>the Bread that
I will give is my Flesh,</hi> will prove the Bread turn'd into his Flesh;
which they so little do, that they rather would imply the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
if understood literally, as I have shewed <hi>pag.</hi> 8</p>
                  <p>But he concludes, <hi>rather than differ, I'le joyn in opinion with the
Protestant Answerer, and these other Divines, and with him and them
submit to the Determination of the Church.</hi> But where is this the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the <hi>Protestant Answerer?</hi> Surely our Author is like him
in <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that where ever he went, fancied he saw himself. But
what need is there to go to the Church in this case? For I hope
he will think sense and reason sufficient to instruct men whether
those words will prove that Christ was turned into Bread: And
we think sense and reason as sufficient to inform them whether
the words of our Saviour will prove that Bread was turn'd into
Christ's Flesh.</p>
                  <p>I now thought this matter had been at an end, when the
<hi>Protestant Answerer</hi> past from this Argument to the second Text.
But our Author has not yet done with him. For he tells us, <q>
                        <hi>There
is one Argument yet, on which the Gentleman seems much to depend</hi>
                        <bibl>(pag. 9.)</bibl>
                     </q>
                     <hi>When he says,</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>Since if Christ be not, but where he intirely
is, then (says he) he must be eaten intirely, &amp;c. From whence he
concludes the not being of Christ's Body in the Sacrament, because (as
he conceives) he is not there intire, for reasons (not Scripture) of his
own,</hi> 
                        <bibl>p. 14.</bibl>
                     </q> Bless me! thought I, where am I now? in the land
of <hi>Oberon?</hi> What shall I say? he quotes <hi>pag.</hi> 9. I hastily turn'd
thither, and there I was satisfied my memory had not yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62597:13"/>
me. The case is thus, the <hi>Answerer,</hi> as is before observed,
to shew the absurdity of our Author's appealing to the mere Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
put several Queries to him out of this Chapter, which he
desired him to resolve in his own way, <hi>without going to Figures.</hi>
The last of which was this, <hi>how he can literally interpret,</hi> ver. 57.
<hi>[He that eateth me] that holds <q>in the Eucharist is contained the true
Body and Blood, together with the Soul and Divinity of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ.</q>âSince if Christ be not but where he intirely is, then he must
be eaten intirely.</hi> This question amongst others was there drop'd by
our Author; and the reason is apparent, for he must either have
acknowledged that the words <hi>He that eateth me,</hi> must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
Figuratively and Spiritually, and not Corporally: Or else
that the Soul and Divinity of Christ must be Eaten with his
Body: Or that the Soul and Divinity of Christ are not in the
Eucharist with his Body. The case, I confess, is hard to one that
has somewhat else to respect than truth; and therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
him to be silent. But why he should now bring it on the
Stage under another guise, I can't imagin, when thus to resume
it, and pervert it, must as much expose his insincerity as the omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of it before, did his inability to answer it. The Reader will see
that the Argument and the conclusion are none of the <hi>Answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>'s;
for that Proposition, <hi>where ever Christ is, there he intirely is,</hi> is
a principle of our Author's, and which is there made use of against
him that profess'd to <hi>believe with the same Faith he believes a God,
that in the Eucharist is truly and substantially contained the true Body
and Blood, together with the Soul and Divinity of our Lord Jesus
Christ,</hi> Cath. Answ. to <hi>Seeker,</hi> p. 4. And where our Author found
the Conclusion. I know not, for there is nothing in the <hi>Protestant
Answer</hi> like to this, that <hi>from thence concludes the not Being of Christ's
Body in the Sacrament, because he is not there intire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However it may not be amiss to see how our Author relieves
himself: Saith he; <hi>To which, I answer and grant, that Christ is not,
but where he is intire. And whether Christ who is perfect God, may not
be intire in the Sacrament, and in many places at one and the same time,
is the Query? which if fully resolved, will overthr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â¢</desc>
                        </gap>w all his reasoning
Ware besides?</hi> Well, how will he prove Christ intirely in the
Sacrament? That is, <hi>the true Body of Christ with the Soul and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.</hi>
That was forgot before, and so is not to be remembred;
but if it may be accepted for a full and intire Answer, he will
prove his Body <hi>may be</hi> intire in many places at one and the same
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62597:14"/>
time. What he saith of that, belongs to another place, and shall
there be considered, <hi>p.</hi> 29. But what is this to his Soul and
Divinity; and to the literal sense of <hi>he that eateth me,</hi> and the
Argument the <hi>Answerer</hi> prest upon him? He will be able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
it, when he can prove his Proposition, that <hi>Christ is not,
but where he is intire;</hi> for then his Body must be Omnipresent as
well as his Divinity, which after all the <hi>may be's,</hi> and his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
to prove it possible for Christ's Body to be in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
at one and the same time, I suppose he will have no <hi>allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>
to <hi>publish,</hi> if he should have the imprudence to maintain.</p>

                     <hi>viz.</hi> This is my Body. <hi>Here the</hi> Protestant
Answerer <hi>shew'd how absurd the direction of the</hi> Seeker <hi>was,
that his Answerers should produce their Texts,</hi> without troubling
themselves to tell the meaning on't, <hi>because he was certain that the
Doctrine of</hi> Transubstantiation <hi>could never be the literal</hi> meaning
<hi>of those words. As for example, saith he,</hi> Where is there one
word, that the <hi>[This]</hi> whatever it means, is the true Body and Blood,
together with the Soul and Divinity of Christ, in the self-same Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
wherein he was born of the Virgin? Where that this true Body
and Blood is truly, really and substantially contained under the Forms of
Bread and Wine? Where that the Bread and Wine are upon Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
turned into the true Body and Blood of Christ? <hi>Let us see how
our Author replies to this,</hi> p. 17. Let us note his Where's. Where,
says he, is there one word? Where that this true Body and Blood?
Where that the Bread and Wine are upon Consecration, turn'd into the
True Body and Blood of Christ, &amp;c. Which truly, are Where's indeed?
<hi>But what's become of</hi> the Soul and Divinity of Christ? <hi>What of</hi>
the self-same Substance wherein he was born of the Virgin? <hi>What of</hi>
the true Body, truly, really, and substantially contain'd under the Forms
of Bread and Wine? <hi>Which are what he profess'd</hi> firmly and truly
to believe by the same Faith he believes a God? <hi>And where (to add
another</hi> Where) <hi>will he find these literally in the words,</hi> This is
my Body? <hi>He tells us</hi> one would think that so many Where's were not
without a Wherefore. And because the Gentleman desires to know the
Where, he shall also know the When. <hi>Certainly now to the Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of</hi> Scotus <hi>and</hi> Biel, &amp;c. <hi>and the confusion of all Hereticks,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62597:14"/>
We shall have a plain discovery, and that in so many words we
shall find</hi> the true Body and Blood, together with the Soul and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
of Christ, <hi>&amp;c. For this go we to his</hi> when Jesus took Bread,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and said, This is my Body, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 26. Then it was, <hi>saith he,</hi>
and, Here it is by power of these words of God, This is my Body, that
the Bread is turned into the Body of Christ. <hi>This is indeed a</hi> submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>to the</hi> Seeker<hi>'s direction to produce the</hi> words without a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>and it is so because it is so;</hi> This is my Body, <hi>doth turn
the Bread into the Body, because there are the words,</hi> This is
my Body. <hi>I hope the Reader is satisfied, for in truth I am.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next thing proposed by the <hi>Prot. Answerer</hi> was, what the
meaning is of <hi>This,</hi> in, <hi>This is my Body?</hi> If, saith he, it be Bread,
then the Bread is in the literal sense, the substance of Christ's
Body, and so overthrows the change to be made in <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation.</hi>
If by <hi>This,</hi> is not meant the Bread, then the Bread
could never be turned into the Body of Christ by vertue of the
words, <hi>This is my Body.</hi> Our Author readily answers, <hi>Ask the
Question, What? and our Saviour will resolve you,</hi> Mat. 26. 26. <hi>This
is (what?) my Body, he did not say, after he had blessed it, Say,
Take, Eat, This is Bread, but my Body; than which, nothing can be
more plain, than that it was his Body.</hi> And to make all sure, he se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
proves it, because it's <hi>not</hi> hic, <hi>but</hi> hoc est panis. It's well
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                     </gap> in the <hi>Greek</hi> is of the same Gender with <hi>panis.</hi> But let us
admit of this Learned Criticism (though by the way let me ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
for our Author's instruction, when the Article relates to
the sentence, it's to be put in the Neuter Gender) the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
put, yet remains; for if the <hi>This</hi> relates to Body, then the
sense is, This Body is my Body. But saith he, <hi>let us</hi> suppose
<hi>This</hi> to refer to <hi>Bread, It yet follows that it is his Body.</hi> But it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
also, as the Answerer argued, that then the Bread is the
Substance of Christ's Body, according to the Letter; and so could
not be turned into it. So that our Author has left the difficulty
as he found it.</p>
                  <p>But because the Answerer here said, <hi>We have not Faith to believe
that reason the Scripture hath not taught,</hi> he very subtilly argues af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this manner: <hi>From whence,</hi> saith he, <hi>I gather, that notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all his Arguments to disprove the Real Presence, yet he hath not
Faith (though face) to deny it. For that</hi> pag. 3. <hi>he tells you that <q>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
their positive Articles, they have a great many Negative ones,</q>
                     </hi>
[and the Answerer tells you, for which we are beholden to the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62597:15"/>
Corruptions and Innovations of the Church of <hi>Rome]</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For
that he hath not faith to believe, what the Scripture hath not taught,
that in the Eucharist is not contain'd the Body of Christ. The Gentleman
therefore can have no Faith to deny it.</hi> A very quaint Argument;
which I shall dismiss with a parallel Instance. He that hath not
Faith to believe that which the Scripture hath not taught, hath
not Faith to deny that to be of Faith which the Scripture doth
not teach: And therefore because <hi>Mahometism</hi> is not taught in
Scripture, he hath not Faith to deny it. But this spirit of acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
doth not last long, for having labour'd to find inconsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
in the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> as set down in the
Answer, he blunders without end. He allows what our Church
saith, <hi>That the Body of Christ is eaten in the Sacrament after an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
and Spiritual manner;</hi> but he adds, <hi>but this we believe to be a
true and real manner, not a Deceitful, Figurative, or Fictitious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
âIf you grant it after a Spiritual manner, you must
grant it there after a true manner. If Christ be there in Spirit,
he is also there in Truth; and if there in Spirit and Truth, all my
Arguments are granted.</hi> I think not; for the Church of <hi>England</hi>
saith, it's <hi>only after an Heavenly and Spiritual manner.</hi> So that
though they do agree, where Christ is in Spirit, he is there in
Truth; yet I doubt me the word <hi>only</hi> alters the case, for he may
be there <hi>in Spirit and in Truth,</hi> and yet not be Corporally there.
And I question whether any thing less will satisfie our Author;
and so it appears; <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>Christ is there after such an Intire,
Real and Substantial manner, as we believe, or he is in no manner there
at all,</hi> p. 19, 20.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Part 2. Sect. 1.</note> and shew'd how little they serve their
Cause; I shall proceed to the Second Part, and that is to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the Texts produced in the <hi>Protestant Answer,</hi> from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of our Author. Here our Author sets his Texts against
those of the Protestant; but it would have done well if he had
first set down what it is he should prove on his own side, <hi>viz.</hi>
That <hi>in the Eucharist is truly, really and substantially contained, under
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62597:15"/>
the Forms of Bread and Wine, the true Body and Blood, together with
the Soul and Divinity of Christ in the same substance wherein he was
born of the Virgin, and wherein he lived and died for us; and this by
the Conversion of the whole Bread into the Body, and the Wine into the
Blood of Christ.</hi> If this had been done, how meanly would it
have look'd<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> though he brought his 24 Texts to prove it?
and surely he could not then have had the confidence to have
said, as he now doth, <hi>I doubt not but it appears that the Texts
brought on the Catholick</hi> [Roman] <hi>side are abundantly plain and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for the Being of Christ's Body in the Sacrament,</hi> as thus set
down. And it would doubtless have been some gratification
to his Reader, if he had given us a Paraphrase as his Adversary
had done, according to these his Sentiments.</p>
                  <p>But here he saith that the Answerer <hi>pretends not to prove by these
Texts that the Body and Blood of Christ are not in the Sacrament,</hi> p. 24
Why so? Because it's one of their Negative Articles, and to
<q>require plain and express words of Scripture to prove such a
thing is not there taught,</q> is, says he, to demand a proof, the
thing is not capable of.âAs if suppose there was not <hi>express
words of Scripture</hi> to confute <hi>Arianism,</hi> therefore that could not
be confuted by Scripture. It's enough that what is not in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is no Article of Faith; it's enough that there are such Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
in Scripture as are sufficient to refute it, though there
should not be <hi>express words.</hi> But however if he will take it in
the words of our Article, and if it may be to his content, we shall
find it positively said that <hi>Transubstantiation is repugnant to the plain
words of Scripture.</hi> And we have our Author acknowledging that
his Adversary undertakes to shew that the Protestants have the
Letter of Scripture for them, <hi>meaning</hi> (as he saith) <hi>that in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
is Not contained the Body of Christ,</hi> p. 30. And now let us

speaking,<note place="margin">Sect. 2.</note> to interpret these words Figuratively, since our
Author after all his Exclamations of <hi>giving Christ the Lie,</hi> is forced
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62597:16"/>
(tho here he slips over it) elsewhere to acknowledg that the
Cup, yea and the word <hi>Bread,</hi> is so used, <hi>p.</hi> 28.</p>
                  <p>2. That in many Instances the Letter of Scripture is for us:
As,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. That there is no Substantial change in the Elements,
but they remain the same Bread and Wine after Consecration as
before. So it's five times call'd <hi>Bread,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 26, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
the whole Solemnity is call'd <hi>Breaking of Bread,</hi> Act. 2. 42.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To this our Author replies several ways, as,</hi> By the word Bread,
<hi>saith he,</hi> is meant the Communion of the Body of Christ, as by the
word <hi>Cup</hi> is signified the Communion of the Blood of Christ, <hi>p.</hi> 24.</p>
                  <p>But to this I answer,</p>
                  <p>1. That if the words <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Cup</hi> are not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
Literally, but with a thereby <hi>is meant,</hi> and thereby <hi>is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi>
then there is no more reason from the bare words to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
<hi>This is my Body</hi> Literally: And that it may be as well
interpreted, This is the Representation, and Sign of my Body, as
this Bread is the Communion of my Body.</p>
                  <p>2. From hence it follows, That if the Bread be the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Body of Christ, as the Cup is the Communion of
the Blood of Christ, then the Bread is no more changed than
the Cup; but as the Cup remains the Cup, so the Bread re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
the Bread in the Communion.</p>
                  <p>3. If the Bread be the Communion of the Body of Christ,
then the Communion of the Body of Christ is in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Bread; and so the Bread is still Bread.</p>
                  <p>4. Our Author has not touched the Point, which was to shew
the Letter of Scripture is for us, when it calls it Bread after
Consecration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But he saith,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> mentions not the words, <hi>Cup</hi>
and <hi>Bread,</hi> but he explains them to be the Body and Blood of Christ,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. As often as ye eat this Bread, ye do shew the Lords
death, which was not shewn, but by offering up his True and Real Body
and Blood.</p>
                  <p>I answer, so we may better say he mentions not the Body of Christ,
but he explains it, when he five times afterwards calls it Bread:
But how doth the <hi>shewing of the Death</hi> of Christ prove the Bread
to be his Body, when it rather proves it not to be his Body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his Body is not, according to them, visible, and to be <hi>shewn?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He saith further,</hi> How could they be guilty of the Body and Blood
of the Lord, <hi>v.</hi> 27. if the Body and Blood be not there?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:62597:16"/>
I answer, As persons may be guilty of it out of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Thus we read <hi>Heb. 6. 6. Who crucifie to themselves the Son
of God afresh.</hi> And <hi>Chap. 10. 29. Who trod under foot the Blood of

in which his Death was Commemorated and Represented,
they after the same manner were by Interpretation guilty of the

<hi>not discerning the Lords Body;</hi> which can be understood only of a
Spiritual discerning by Faith. Or rather as the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly, he adds,</hi> 'Twould be hard a sinner should be damn'd meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for moderate eating and drinking Wine; for according to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Answerer, the Sacrament is no more, who tells you, <hi>p.</hi> 11. There
is no other Substance distributed among the Communicants, than that of
Bread and Wine.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>But if our Author had gone three or four Lines further,
he would have found those words,</hi> pag. 11. The Body of Christ
is not otherwise present than it is eaten, that is, after an Heavenly and
Spiritual Manner, in the Spiritual Blessings and effects of his Merits
and Sufferings in his Body, to those that believe. <hi>So that he preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricates,
when he saith,</hi> Sinners are damn'd meerly for moderate eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and drinking, <hi>and that we esteem the</hi> Sacrament no more.</p>
                  <p>2. We look upon it as a <hi>Divine Institution, and by virtue of that
Institution a means of Grace; and that by a worthy participation of it,
we partake of that Grace which is thereto promised, therein exhibited,
and thereby conveighed,</hi> as it's there declared, <hi>p.</hi> 17. and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the damnation threatned is to the contempt of God's
Ordinance, and of the Sufferings of Christ therein represented,
and of the Grace of God purchased by those Sufferings, and
therein to be obtained.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Answerer</hi> shew'd, also as the Bread, so the Wine was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
alteration, from <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 28. who after he had said, <hi>This
is my Blood,</hi> calls it the <hi>Fruit of the Vine.</hi> And from the order in
St. <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 23, 24. where the Apostles are said to have drank
of it, before our Saviour said, <hi>This is my Blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Branch of the Argument our Author divides from the
other, and casts it forward three or four Pages, <hi>Pag.</hi> 28. for
it gave too much light to the other, whilst they were toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As to the former Text,</hi> I will not drink of the fruit of the Vine,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62597:17"/>
                     <hi>he saith,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> gives the plainest order of it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 22. 14. and
that there it has relation to the Paschal Cup.</p>
                  <p>I grant, that in St. <hi>Luke</hi> it more immediately is joyn'd to the
Paschal Feast, but yet in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> Christ is said to
have spoke these words after the delivery of the Cup in the
Lords-Supper. And the least that can be observed from hence is,
that it was indifferently to be applied to either; and so it more
strongly argues that it was alike to be understood [that the Wine
in the Eucharistical Cup was the natural fruit of the Vine, as
that in the Paschal] as that the substance of both was one and
the same, and no more change in the one than the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But,</hi> suppose this, yet, <hi>saith he,</hi> the meaning of these words could in
no wise be applied to the Substance of Wine proceeding from an Earthly
Vine; but to the Substance of his Blood, the fruit of the Heavenly Vine,
for that it was to be drank new with them in his Father's Kingdom,
which is Heaven, where they neither keep Taverns, nor drink Wine,
&amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Some persons while they charge others with irreverence,
themselves seem to have lost all due reverence for holy things.</p>
                  <p>We will suppose, in favour of our Author, that by <hi>the Kingdom
of God</hi> our Saviour means Heaven, and by the <hi>Fruit of the Vine,</hi> he
means the Substance of Christ's Blood; yet how will it follow
that it's the same Fruit of the Vine they drink of in Heaven as
they drank of in the Sacrament; since the Blood of Christ is
no more drank in Heaven, than Wine; nor is the Sacrament any
more administred there, than the Passover? So that if by the
Kingdom of God, Heaven is to be understood, then the phrase,
<hi>Till I drink it new,</hi> signifies Mystically and Figuratively according
to the manner of Scripture, which sets forth the happiness of
that state by eating, <hi>Mat. 8. 11. Luk.</hi> 14. 15. and the excellency
and perfection of it by the word <hi>New,</hi> Revel. 14. 13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
so the meaning is, I shall not henceforth thus eat with you;
the next Festival I shall observe, will be in Heaven; there we that
have now thus eat and drank together, shall partake of the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of that state; and this fruit of the Earthly Vine shall be
exchanged for Rivers of Heavenly Pleasures, which we shall there
be entertained with.</p>
                  <p>The next thing observed by the <hi>Answerer</hi> in proof of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Wine continuing so after Consecration, was from
the order observed in St. <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 23. where it's said the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62597:17"/>
drank of the Wine, before our Saviour said, <hi>This is my
Blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here our Author thinks himself excus'd from an Answer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of an Error in the Press, <hi>Body</hi> being put for <hi>Blood.</hi> But if
he turned to the Text, he might see that place was quoted right,
and common sense would serve to rectifie it. However he cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously
offers somewhat in the mean time, by way of Answer,
viz. <hi>Whether St.</hi> Mark <hi>expresseth the words in the same order as they
were spoken or no, it matters not; seeing he has the Substance of what
was said, and wherein they all agree; to wit, that it was his Blood.
And it's also apparent that Christ first gave thanks, and blessed it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he gave it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>pag.</hi> 29. But doth it not matter whether St.
<hi>Mark</hi> expresseth the words in order? Certainly if the order he
recites it in, were the order observed by our Saviour, and that
the Apostles received the Cup, and drank of the Wine before
<hi>the words of Conversion</hi> (as they call them) were used, then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
(as the <hi>Answerer</hi> argued) that they only drank of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Wine, and that the words, <hi>This is my Blood,</hi> could
not signifie, and much less produce a Conversion of the Wine
into the Blood of Christ. This our-Author was sensible of, and
therefore in his Answer left out the main part of it. For what
tho all the Evangelists agree that the words, <hi>This is my Blood;</hi>
were then used by our Saviour? What though <hi>Christ first gave
thanks, and blessed it, before he gave it,</hi> if he did not also use the
words of Conversion, <hi>before he gave it?</hi> For all the rest he might
do, and yet the Wine be Wine still (as they own.) But thus it
was, if St. <hi>Mark</hi> is right in the order, and it seems to be the proper
order, because he only speaks of the particular, <hi>that they all drank
of it.</hi> But we are not to have any thing to the purpose <hi>till</hi> (as
he saith) <hi>the Bill be amended,</hi> and that I take for his best An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. The <hi>Protestant Answerer</hi> shewed the Letter of Scripture
is for us, that our Saviour's Body had the natural and insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Properties of a Body, such as Extension, Circumscription, <hi>&amp;c.
p.</hi> 15. Here our Author calls in the Faith of a Christian, and the
Almighty Power of God to his Succour; and looks upon the
<hi>Answerer</hi> as a second <hi>Didymus,</hi> because he will, like him, <hi>not believe
except he sees;</hi> and <hi>worse</hi> than him, <hi>who saw but the Humanity, yet
believed the Divinity of Christ,</hi> p. 30. But why all this, when he
believes all the Scripture teaches, and reason it self justifies?
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62597:18"/>
May not a man believe, unless he believes contrary to what he
himself sees, and the Scripture teaches? Or why is he <hi>worse</hi> than
<hi>Thomas,</hi> when <hi>Thomas</hi> would not believe unless he saw? But
the <hi>Answerer</hi> is one of those (Thanks be to God) whom our
Saviour pronounced Blessed, <hi>That have not seen, and yet have believed.</hi>
What is there he would have him believe? It is what was never
put to <hi>Thomas,</hi> for our Saviour convinced him by an ocular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,
<hi>Joh. 20. 27. Reach hither thy finger, and behold,</hi> &amp;c.
As much as if he had said, The Resurrection is real, for it's a
real Body that is before thee; and it's my Body, for <hi>reach hither
thy finger,</hi> &amp;c. It's plain our Saviour here thought he gave an
unquestionable Proof of the Truth of his Resurrection by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Body to <hi>Thomas,</hi> which could not have been, had not his
Body had the properties of an human body, without which it could
not have been a Body; or which if it had been without, <hi>Thomas</hi>
could not have been convinced in that way, that it was his Body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But our Author here undertakes to prove, that this was not the
Condition of our Saviour's Body; or, that he could by his power
separate these essential Properties of a Body from his Body. Here
I must confess my self indebted to him for an answer to what he
offered to this purpose before, but not to the purpose of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
there, and here repeats.</hi> Pray, <hi>saith he,</hi> how was his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to be seen, Extended, Finite, and Circumscribed, when he pass'd through
Walls and Doors that were close? <hi>John</hi> 20. 17. He entred the room,
the Doors being shut.âHow came he through? Was his Body In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
Extended, Finite, and Circumscribed with Limbs, Bones, and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news?
âSuch is the Infinite Power of God, that though they were
inclosed in walls every where a Mile thick, 'twould yet be possible for
Christ to enter intire through all, <hi>p.</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>Here is one thing omitted, and that is to prove, that as the
Doors were shut, when they assembled, <hi>for fear of the Jews</hi> (as
the Evangelist saith) so they were not opened by Christ, when
he came and stood in the midst of them; till which be proved,
we shall say the letter of Scripture is for us, and that Christ's
Body had Flesh and Bones, might be beheld and felt, and did
neither come through the Walls, nor indeed could do, so long as
it remains true that the Penetration of Dimensions is impossible.
But I had need to recal this; for I am for ever silenced if what
he saith be true, that the <hi>Answerer argues perfidiously of Christ, as
if he were not God, not distinguishing betweeen his Glorious Body and ours;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62597:18"/>
for as God, all things are possible to him.</hi> But where is that <hi>perfidious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
since no more is denied to Christ, than is to God? For because
all things are possible to God, doth he think that it's <hi>perfidious</hi>
to say, that it's not possible for God to be ignorant or unfaithful,
or circumscrib'd, and so to exist after the manner of a Body? Or
doth he think it's <hi>perfidious</hi> to say, it's impossible to make the
Body of Christ to have been existent in different times, and real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to have been existent before it was existent, and yet not to be
existent till it was? Or is it <hi>perfidious</hi> to say, it's impossible to
make the circumscribed Body of Christ to be Omnipresent?
The last he seems to affirm by his often repeated Maxim, That
<hi>Christ is not but where he is intire, and placing therein</hi> the Difference
between <hi>Christ's Glorious Body and ours.</hi> But of that more anon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Our Author, as he would prove the Body of Christ might lose
all the Properties of a Body, so also that it might be</hi> contained under
the Forms of Bread and Wine, <hi>that is, to all appearance it might
have all the Properties of those Elements, and yet be none of
them, but the Body of Christ alone. And this he reasons
upon, after this manner,</hi> Where is the difficulty to believe but this may
be, as the Holy Ghost under the Form of a Dove, with Feather, Beak,
Wing, and all the properties of a Fowl? Or in the Form of Tongues of
Fire? Both which to our eyes were but as a perfect Dove, and as perfect
Tongues; yet those different objects to the eye of Flesh, were but one
Holy Ghost to the Eye of Faith. Therefore nothing can be more plain
than that Objects may be one thing to the Eye of Flesh, and another thing
to the Eye of Faith. So in the Sacrament, to our sight and tast is plain
Bread and Wine, but to our Faith (in Gods word) it is the Real and
Intire Body and Blood of Christ.</p>
                  <p>An instance and inference not at all to the purpose. For the
Question is not, Whether a Spiritual Being may not be under the
appearance of a Body? for so it was with the Angels when they
appeared as men, and the Holy Ghost when it appeared like a
Dove. Neither is the Question, whether an Object may be one
thing to the <hi>eye of Flesh,</hi> and another to the <hi>eye of Faith?</hi> for so our
Saviour appear'd to be man, and yet was God as well as man. All
which yet is besides the matter, for in these cases there is an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Being under a visible representation, or an Invisible Being in
union to a visible. But here are two objects visible in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Body of Christ, and Bread; and the one of these so turn'd
into the other, that there are all the Properties of a visible Being,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62597:19"/>
which is not there, <hi>viz.</hi> Bread; and none of the properties of that
visible Being which is there, <hi>viz.</hi> the Body of Christ. So that the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
should be thus propos'd, Whether what is an object of
sense, may have all the properties of another sensible object, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being that thing which they are the properties of; and none
of the properties belonging to its own nature and being?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. The <hi>Protestant Answerer</hi> shew'd, that the Letter of
Scripture is for us, that the Body of Christ as it ascended, so is
to continue in Heaven till the conclusion of the world; and so
cannot be in Heaven and Earth at the same time. This our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
calls a <hi>barren conceit;</hi> but as <hi>barren</hi> as it is, it is true, and
has Scripture and Reason on its side, notwithstanding what he
has objected to the contrary. The first Argument he offers in
Answer to this is, <hi>that he is a perfect and omnipotent-God.</hi> And that
he may be, and yet not reconcile contradictions (as has been
just before shewed.) He confirms it by Scripture, <hi>Mat. 18. 20.
c. 28. 20. Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there
am I in the midst of them. And if there, he is there intire, or not at all,
p. 15. &amp;</hi> 32. But when Christ promised to be in the midst of
them, did he promise to be there Corporally? If bodily, I would
fain know under what Form he is there? And if he be <hi>intire</hi>
where ever he is, and yet he is every where as God, then the
Body of Christ must be as Omnipresent as his Divinity; and so
there would be no need, nor indeed possibility of his <hi>Descending.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He adds,</hi> Our Saviour is not so confined in Heaven, as that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
also be upon Earth; for we read that he Descended and overthrew
<hi>Saul</hi> in the way to <hi>Damascus,</hi> and spoke to him, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 4. And he
may be actually present without being seen, for the men with <hi>Saul</hi> saw no
man, <hi>v.</hi> 7. By all which it's plain, that Christ may be in Earth, and
in many places at the same time, as well as in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>But to this I answer, (1.) It's not certain that the Apostle
saw, or that Christ appeared to his <hi>Fleshly eye.</hi> For elsewhere he
is said to see him in a <hi>trance,</hi> Act. 22. 17. and here <hi>v.</hi> 4. to <hi>fall
on the Earth;</hi> and so God is said to be seen, when yet there was
no similitude, <hi>Exod. 24. 10. Deut.</hi> 4. 12.</p>
                  <p>(2.) If he was seen bodily, yet it's not said, as our Author
would have it, that he <hi>Descended,</hi> and was bodily present.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But it might be as with St.</hi> Stephen, <hi>who</hi> looked up to Heaven, and
saw Jesus standing on the right hand of God, <hi>Act. 7. 55. And so here</hi>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:62597:19"/>
v. 3. <hi>it's said, that</hi> there shined round about (St. <hi>Paul)</hi> a light from
Heaven.</p>
                  <p>(3.) Much less is there so much as any intimation of what
our Author saith, that Christ was <hi>Bodily in Heaven and the Earth
at the same time.</hi> For if he was in in the one, it's certain he was
not Bodily in the other. And this our Author unwittingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges,
when he saith <hi>Christ descended and overthrew Saul.</hi>
So <hi>Vigilius Tapsitanus, When the Body of Christ was in the Earth, it
was not in Heaven; and now because it is in Heaven, 'tis not in the
Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. The Answerer argued on, That the Letter is for us,
that Christ was but once offered as a Propitiatory Sacrifice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
that his Body is Glorified and so not to be offer'd, <hi>Heb. 9. 28, &amp;c.</hi>
But to this our Author has made no Reply.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. III.</head>
                  <p>FRom hence the <hi>Prot. Answerer</hi> proceeded to shew, that as the
Letter of Scripture is for us, so are the words which are Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative,
as in those, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> p. 16. The method was
here orderly and distinct, but our Author runs one into another.
I shall gather up what he saith as well as I can. The Arguments
by which the <hi>Answerer</hi> proved those words to be <hi>Figurative,</hi> are
as followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. From the word <hi>This,</hi> which if to be understood of
the Bread, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> grants, then the word <hi>Body</hi> must be <hi>Figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively</hi>
understood. And that it was the Bread, at least in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with the other acts relating to it, the <hi>Answerer</hi> shew'd,
which our Author lets pass.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. The <hi>Answerer</hi> argues, if the words are to be understood
literally and properly, when these words were said by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
then the Body would be broken, before it was broken.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To this our Author answers,</hi> (1.) P. 26. Though his Natural
Body be there, yet the manner of it's Being is Spiritual and Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
and the manner of its Breaking follows the manner of its Being; his
Body is there Broken in the Sign, not the Substance.</p>
                  <p>I answer, That to speak of a Body's being after the manner of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62597:20"/>
a Spirit, is as much as to say on the contrary, A Spirit exists af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the manner of a Body: that is, That Body may be a Spirit,
and a Spirit a Body.</p>
                  <p>2. If the Body be in the manner of its Being only Spiritual
and Sacramental, and the breaking in the manner of its break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
be only Spiritually, then why not the Body be only Spiritual
and Sacramental? Or why should we any more <hi>profess our selves
Jews or Infidels</hi> (as he would have it) <hi>to doubt, whether, nay to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
what Christ said was improper</hi> and Metaphorical, when we
say, <hi>This is my Body</hi> is to be understood Figuratively and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually,
than it's to say (as he doth) it's broken spiritually; since,
as the <hi>Answerer</hi> observ'd it's as well said, <hi>This is broken, as This is my
Body:</hi> And our Author saith, <hi>the manner of its being and breaking,
are Spiritual and Sacramental, Mystical and Representative?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. But this is besides the case; for the Question is not about
the manner of Breaking, but how Christ could say, This is
Broken (if not Figuratively understood) before it was broken.
But to this we are to expect an Answer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But he adds<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
                     </hi> (2.) Moreover these words [which is broken] do prove
(as the Holy Catholick Church always did, and ever will hold) it to be
a true, proper Sacrifice; for the being broken, explains the Nature of a
Sacrifice, which imports the destruction of the thing offered, if corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
and liable to destruction: But the Body of Christ being Incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Immortal, can't be really hurt, therefore the manner of breaking,
is only Mystical and Representative.</p>
                  <p>Setting aside that what he saith concerning the Catholick
Church, is spoken Gratis, I answer, If the nature of a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<hi>imports the destruction of the thing offered, if corruptible and liable to
destruction,</hi> then the Body of Christ must have been destroy'd (if a
<hi>proper Sacrifice)</hi> before it was destroy'd; for the Body of Christ (when
Christ spoke these words, <hi>This is my Body)</hi> was certainly <hi>liable
to destruction.</hi> And so he has fastned the Objection, instead of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
it.</p>
                  <p>(3.) <hi>He concludes,</hi> If this manner of Breaking, pleases not the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
<hi>(as in truth it doth not, and he has now given his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
for it)</hi> let us see whether the Body of Christ were not otherwise
Broke before he instituted the Sacrament. Now his Body was pierced,
and Blood spilt at his Circumcision, followed by unspeakable Pains, rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Labours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What his Agony in the Garden? What his being
crowned with Thorns and Bloody Whipping at the Pillar?âWhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62597:20"/>
with Truth our Saviour might have said of his Body [which is broke]
without supposing any thing improper or untrue.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>What doth our Author mean when he saith he would</hi> see,
Whether the Body of Christ were not otherwise broken before he instituted
the Sacrament: <hi>And instances in his</hi> Agony in the Garden, his crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Thorns, and whipping? <hi>Doth he think these were before
the Sacrament?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. If this was the meaning of our Saviour, when he said,
<hi>This is my Body which is broken,</hi> that he was Circumcised, and in
an Agony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then where is the Sacrifice, which he saith, <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts
the destruction of the thing?</hi> Which these things were neither
literally nor mystically.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. The Answerer urged, that Jesus himself then took
the Bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when he said, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and yet Jesus had
at that time a Body which was not broken, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> no not so much
as mystically. So that the same Body was whole and broken.
Here our Author is silent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. He argued from the words, <hi>Do this in Remembrance of
me,</hi> which supposes absence; and therefore an Institution set up
in remembrance, and yet in which the Body was to be actually
present, is to suppose the Body to be absent and present at the
same time.</p>
                  <p>To this he answers.</p>
                  <p>1. That those words no way relate to the Laity, who only receive the
Sacrament, but to the Priests, who consecrate and administer, for it's no
where said, This Eat, This Take, This Receive, but, This Do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. If this be so, then there is no command to the People to
receive.</p>
                  <p>2. To whom did the Apostle write his Epistle, but to Laity
as well as Priests.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Surely he did not read</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 24. <hi>where the Apostle
saith,</hi> Take, Eat, This is my Body. This do; <hi>What? but, Take,
Eat; so v.</hi> 25. This do ye, as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me.
This do: <hi>What? but,</hi> Drink this.</p>
                  <p>But after all, what is this to the Argument? For whether
these Words were spoke to the Laity or Priests, relates not to the
Case; but the Question is, Whether Remembrance of Persons,
is in its true Notion consistent with Presence?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:62597:21"/>
To this he answers,</p>
                  <p>The Seeker unanswerably observed, that the Remembrance of its Being,
doth no way make it cease to be. <hi>A wise Observation! But what then?
Doth it not suppose the Absence of the thing?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This he saith is a</hi> weak piece of Sophistry, as if, <hi>saith he,</hi> my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of your being with me, when Present, did any wise suppose
your Absence from me.</p>
                  <p>But I thought, with the rest of Mankind, that Remembrance
and Sight are as distinct in their notion, as Absence and Presence;
and that I may as well see what is Absent, as remember what is
Present: What is Present we see and know, but what is Unseen
and Absent, we remember.</p>
                  <p>After all, we see that the Author has left no Rule to direct a
true <hi>Seeker</hi> to, no Guide to direct him, no Arguments to settle
his wavering mind; and if there be not a better Rule, Guide, or
Arguments than he has offered toward his Conviction, there is
no help for it, but the <hi>Seeker</hi> must live and dye a <hi>Seeker.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It's impossible to convince a man that has Sense and Reason,
that he must not use them, and that whatever use they may be
of in Temporal Matters, they ought to be of none in Religion:
and he that will undertake this difficult task, must either prove
he doth not contradict himself when he will shew and refer him
to the Letter of Scripture, and wish him to use his Eyes to see it,
And his reason to judg of it; or else he must prove that both
parts of a Contradiction may be true. And having brought our
Author hither, I may safely leave him, and conclude his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
together.</p>
