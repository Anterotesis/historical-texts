         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The way toward the facile <hi>Redargution</hi> of all, either downright, or oblique and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrible <hi>Atheiſticall Miſapprehenſions,</hi> appearing thus plain; the reſentment of our <hi>Duty,</hi> both

            </p>
            <p>Now, albeit this was the <hi>Series,</hi> or ſubalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſyntax of our <hi>Thoughts,</hi> to which our <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation</hi> of this <hi>Work,</hi> as the loweſt link, was connected; yet dare we not ſay, that this <hi>Argument</hi> was wholly of our own <hi>Election:</hi> for we have long inclined to that opinion of <hi>Socrates</hi>

thoughts of every <hi>Individuall</hi> to this or that particular key: and therefore apprehended it as criminall, to ſtifle or extinguiſh thoſe <hi>ſparks,</hi> which we could not but perceive to be kindled, and glow within our breaſt.</p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Second,</hi> viz. the <hi>Neceſsity of Naturall Theology,</hi> we are not ſingular in our perſuaſion, that theſe two Poſitions, <hi>That there is a God,</hi> and that <hi>the Soul of man is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance perfectly diſtinct from his body, and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Immortality, by the Charter of its Eſſence;</hi> are the Principall among thoſe <hi>Verities,</hi> which are to be demonſtrated by <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then <hi>Divines.</hi> For, though to us whoſe <hi>Mindes</hi> are deeply imbued with the ſacred tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of <hi>Chriſtianiſme,</hi> it ſufficeth to aſſume upon the evidence of meer <hi>Faith,</hi> that God is, and that the Human Soule, being conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuperior to Corruptibility, doth eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurvive the Funerall of the Body: yet, aſſuredly can the meer <hi>Naturall</hi> man, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the ſtate of <hi>Infidelity,</hi> never be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to embrace either any <hi>Religion,</hi> or any <hi>Morall Virtue,</hi> unleſſe both thoſe <hi>Propoſitions</hi> fundamentall be firſt evicted to him, by <hi>Reaſons</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49051:11"/>
               <hi>Apodictical,</hi> deſumed from that infallible <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terion,</hi> the <hi>Light of Nature;</hi> from whoſe Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature there can be no appeal.</p>
            <p>And, ſince in this life of <hi>Senſuality,</hi> the Encouragements and Invitations to <hi>vice,</hi> are both more and ſtronger, then thoſe to <hi>virtue:</hi> moſt certain it is, that very few men would prefer the harſh dictates of <hi>Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi> and <hi>Right,</hi> to thoſe more complacent ones of <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Profit;</hi> if they neither feared the juſt vindiction of an <hi>All-obſervant Deity,</hi> nor expected a future <hi>Subſiſtence</hi> after Death. Now, however it be indubitable, that the Exiſtence of God ought firmly to be beleeved, becauſe it is commonſtrated in <hi>Sacred Writ;</hi> And, by converſion, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writ ought to be beleeved, becauſe it is deſumed from God: for, ſince <hi>Faith</hi> is the Gift of God, he that gives Grace ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the ſtable Apprehenſion of other things contained therein, can alſo give Grace ſufficient to the admiſsion of his Exiſtence. yet cannot this kind of <hi>Argumentation,</hi> with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable hopes of his Conviction, be propoſed to an <hi>Infidell;</hi> who looks upon <hi>Reaſon</hi> onely,
<pb facs="tcp:49051:12"/>
as the chief inducement of <hi>Beleef:</hi> becauſe it is a manifeſt <hi>Circle,</hi> whoſe parts reciprocal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depend upon each other for probation, and therefore he may lawfully except againſt it.</p>
            <p>Again, as it is indiſpenſably <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of <hi>Inſidels;</hi> ſo is it not <hi>Unneceſsary,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to <hi>Beleevers,</hi> to prove the <hi>Certitude</hi> of theſe two main Pillars of all Religion, and Morality: ſince the Evidence of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perannexed to that of <hi>Faith,</hi> muſt of neceſsity if not augment, yet <hi>Corroborate</hi> it: and that happy ſoul muſt, doubtleſſe, have much a clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer perception of the <hi>verity</hi> of <hi>ſupernaturall Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> who ſpeculates them both by the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and of <hi>Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, though we ſhould be ſo largely Charitable, as to grant, that there are no Atheiſts to be found among Chriſtians: which is more then the obſervation of the good <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> would give him leave to allow, when he ſaid, <hi>dici quidem nonnullos Chriſtianos, eſse verò nullius Numinis cultores</hi>

                  </gap>yphon.</note>: and that the Principles of Religion are ſteadily beleeved by All, who make an externall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of them: yet notwithſtanding would
<pb facs="tcp:49051:12"/>
it not genuinely follow, that therefore it is a <hi>Pleonaſm,</hi> or <hi>Parergy</hi> to ratify thoſe Principles to Beleevers, by the concurrent Teſtimony of that Oracle, <hi>Reaſon,</hi> to whoſe <hi>Dictates</hi> all Nations, all Ages, all Intereſts have unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly ſubmitted their Aſſent. For, as it muſt conduce to the <hi>Information</hi> of <hi>Unbeleevers:</hi> So alſo, proportionately, to the <hi>Confirmation</hi> of <hi>Beleevers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, as it hath been the poſitive and ſetled judgement of moſt <hi>Divines,</hi> both Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and Recent, not onely that the <hi>Exiſtence</hi> of God may be demonſtrated, or irreſiſtibly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced upon the moſt praevaricate underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by the preſſure of <hi>Reaſons purely Naturall;</hi> but alſo, that the Cognition of the <hi>Non-princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate</hi> and <hi>Self-dependent Being,</hi> is farre more eaſily acquired, then the Cognition of any <hi>Created Nature</hi> whatſoever: inſomuch as every man brings into the world with him a certain <hi>Proleptical,</hi> or anticipated <hi>Notion</hi> of the <hi>Deity,</hi> indelebly impreſſed upon the very ſubſtance of his minde; but the <hi>Science</hi> of all other <hi>Entities</hi> doth emerge from the Ideas of their natures, <hi>Extradvenient</hi> or <hi>Adventitious</hi> to the <hi>Cognoſcent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,</hi>

            <p>Moreover, every Brain is not conſtellated for new <hi>Diſcoveries;</hi> nor can every Age boaſt the production of a <hi>Copernicus, Gilbert, Galilaeo, Merſennus, Carteſius,</hi> or a <hi>Harvy:</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence introducing ſuch, as Time doth <hi>New Stars,</hi> ſingle and ſeldom. ¶.</p>
            <p>And as concerning our <hi>laſt Requiſite, viz.</hi> an aequitable conſideration of our <hi>Defects</hi> and <hi>Impediments;</hi> to this alſo are we conſtrained to court our Reader, in order to our refraction of the <hi>Rigor</hi> of Cenſure.

            <p>Firſt, the often Fermentations and Ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litions of our <hi>Melancholy;</hi> to the tyranny of which faeculent and Saturnine humor both our native Temperament, and ſedentary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative condition of life have aequally ſubjected us; could not but as often obnu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilate the region of our Mind, and darken the proſpect of our ſoul, by infecting the requiſite purity and lucidity of our ſpirits, with thick clouds of opac and fuliginous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the courſe of our <hi>Profeſsion,</hi> rendring us obnoxious to many more <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions, Interturbations,</hi> and <hi>Avocations,</hi> by the intruſion and importunity of the <hi>Sick,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And, Thirdly, it cannot but deſerve ſome favour, to give notice; that the Clue of our ſtudies was broken off in the midſt, by the rough hand of the late <hi>Epidemick Dyſentery,</hi> which arreſting us even then, when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of this Web required the moſt confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vigour of body, and ſerenity of minde; confined us to the dungeon of a ſick bed ſo long and cloſely, that it hath left ſenſible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions of its Malignity, not only upon our Conſtitution, but alſo upon more then halfe of theſe our <hi>Lucrubrations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To theſe Mitigatory Arguments, may rightly be added, the <hi>Narrowneſs</hi> of our prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Fortunes,</hi> the <hi>Thinneſs</hi> of our <hi>Library,</hi> our taedious attendance on <hi>Commitees</hi> (all the ſad effects of our late <hi>Inteſtine Warres)</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſome other private <hi>Remora's,</hi> the

            <p>Now, this humble <hi>Apology</hi> we addreſs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>Erudite</hi> and <hi>Candid,</hi> experience having confirmed, that none the ſtrongeſt Charme of Reaſon, can binde the virulent tongue of that livid Viper, <hi>Envy,</hi> the ſpirit of whoſe venom doth wholly conſiſt in <hi>Detraction.</hi>

Now of thoſe <hi>Ideas,</hi> or <hi>Repreſentations</hi> exhibited to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding there are three diſtinct orders 1. Some are <hi>Innate,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Article 2. Thoſe Ideas are 1 Innate. 2. Adventitious.</note> or <hi>Congenial;</hi> for that I may underſtand, what a <hi>Thing</hi> is, what <hi>Truth</hi> is, what the act of <hi>Cogitation</hi> is: I need the aſſiſtance, or information of no other nature, but my own. 2. Others are <hi>Adventitious,</hi> or emergent from external objects; for that I actually hear ſounds, ſee the light of the Sun, feel the heat of fire and become ſenſible of all other qualities of bodies: I have ever hitherto adjudged theſe acts of ſenſation to belong to my eſſence onely at ſecond hand, as being derivative from other cauſes, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and alien to my nature. 3. And finally others are <hi>Created,</hi>

                  <p>As for thoſe <hi>Ideas,</hi> on which I look as proceeding from things exiſtent without the circle of my ſelf; I make this enquiry: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Article 3. A ſtrict enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, whether the Ideas of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects exiſtent without our ſelves, hold an exact ſimilitude to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> there be any reaſon ſufficient to perſwade me to conceive, that ſuch <hi>Ideas</hi> are exactly like to thoſe <hi>things;</hi> whether theſe <hi>Copies</hi> or tranſcripts are drawn to the life, ſo as in all particulars to reſemble their <hi>originals?</hi> And the determination, wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all I ſatisfie my ſelf, is this; that the <hi>Affirmative</hi> is taught me by nature, as being hitherto inſtructed, that thoſe <hi>Ideas</hi> have no dependence at all on my <hi>Will:</hi> and ſo, by conſequence, proceed not from my ſelf, but are obtruded upon my cognition even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my Will. For inſtance, whether I will, or nill, I am ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the heat of <hi>Fire:</hi> and therefore think this perception or Idea of heat, to proceed from ſomething diſtinct from my ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> from the heat of that fire, by which I ſtand, and obvious it is, beyond all heſitancy, that I may judge that this fire doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit into me rather the <hi>ſimilitude</hi> of it ſelf, then any thing elſe. The ſtability of which reaſons, I ſhall now ſtrictly examine. When I here ſay, <hi>I am thus inſtructed by Nature;</hi> I intend only that I am rapt on, by a certain ſpontaneous violence, or native propenſity, to ſubmit my aſſent thereunto: not that this declared
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49051:29"/>
unto me to be a firm and uncontrollable truth, by the <hi>light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> For I diſcover a vaſt and irreconcileable diſparity between the <hi>Dictates</hi> of theſe two <hi>Informers:</hi> and the <hi>Difference</hi> may be ſtated thus. Whatever things are declared unto me, by the <hi>light of Nature;</hi> as this, that <hi>I am, becauſe I doubt,</hi> that 2 <hi>and</hi> 3 <hi>make</hi> 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> can never, on any pretence, be doubted of, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard there can be no other <hi>faculty,</hi> or <hi>Criterion,</hi> to whoſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or deciſion, I can afford ſo ample and firme credit, as to that of the <hi>light of Nature,</hi> which onely can teach me, whether thoſe things are true or falſe. But as for thoſe <hi>Inclinations,</hi> or <hi>Propenſions naturall;</hi> I have long ſince found, by deplorable experience, that by them I have been frequently hurried unto, and in a ſort impelled upon this <hi>evill,</hi> in my ſolitary diſputes with my ſelf concerning my judicature and election of the <hi>Good:</hi> and therefore am not in any meaſure convinced, why I ſhould depend upon their information, purſue their conduct, or reſigne my aſſent to their teſtimony, in other caſes. Again, though theſe <hi>Extradvenient Ideas</hi> depend not on my <hi>Will;</hi> yet is that no valid Argument, that therefore of neceſſity they muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from things without my ſelf: for as thoſe ſtrong <hi>Propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> though ſeated in me, and as it were annexed to my very being, doe yet ſeem clearly diſtinct from my <hi>Will;</hi> ſo alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance there may be another third <hi>Faculty</hi> within me, which I doe not yet ſufficiently underſtand, that coyns thoſe Ideas, as hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto my conceptions have ever been, that in my <hi>dreams</hi> ſuch <hi>Ideas</hi> are created in my brain, without the aſſiſtance of any forreign <hi>Objects</hi> invading my <hi>ſenſes.</hi> And, laſtly, ſhould I grant thoſe <hi>Counterfeits,</hi> or <hi>Ideas,</hi> to be deſumed from things diſtinct from my ſelfe; yet could it be no juſtifiable inference, that therefore they muſt in all points reſemble thoſe things, or <hi>prototypes,</hi> from which they were tranſmitted: yea, in many particulars, I apprehend them to be diſproportionate and diſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, <hi>toto coelo,</hi> by inequalities never to be parallels. To inſtance; I finde within my ſelf two divers <hi>Ideas</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> the one taken from my <hi>ſenſe,</hi> (which I therefore think fit to refer to that claſſis of Ideas, called <hi>Adventitious)</hi> repreſenting the Sun in a very ſmall round, of leſs diameter then a Coach wheel: the other
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49051:30"/>
from the reaſons or <hi>maximes of Aſtronomy, i. e.</hi> extracted by way of induction, from certain <hi>Notions</hi> implantate in me, or by any other way whatever compoſed or modelled; which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the Sun in a vaſt circumference, much larger then the Terraqueous Globe. Now both theſe cannot exactly reſpond in magnitude to their <hi>Originall,</hi> the <hi>Sun,</hi> exiſtent without me: and reaſon offers me invincible evidence to aſſure that image to be the moſt unlike, which ſeems to have moſt neerly ſtreamed from the Sun it ſelf. All which conſiderations to ample ſatisfaction evince; that hitherto I have, not upon any <hi>ſcientificall</hi> and <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick judgement,</hi> but onely upon a certain <hi>obſcure and blinde impulſe</hi> from within, beleived, that there are a ſort of <hi>Entities</hi> exiſtent without the ſphear of my nature, which, by ſubtle tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion through the organs of my ſenſes, convey the <hi>Ideas,</hi> or <hi>Idols</hi> of themſelves into my mind.</p>
                  <p>But I have found out another certain way, for the more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py progreſs of my enquiry, <hi>Whether any of thoſe entities whoſe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Article 4. A ſecond diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any of thoſe things whoſe Ideas are ſound in the mind of man, have any reall exiſtence without it?</note> 
                     <hi>Ideas ſojurn within me, have any reall exiſtence without me;</hi> and this is it. Theſe <hi>Ideas,</hi> conſidered in this relation, that they are certain <hi>modi cogitandi,</hi> or means which the ſoul makes uſe of, in order to her act of <hi>Cogitation;</hi> have indeed no <hi>diſſimilitude, Alogy,</hi> or inequality amongſt themſelves, and all ſeem to ſlow from me, in one and the ſame chanel, after one and the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: but conſidered in this intereſt, that one repreſents one thing, a ſecond another, a third another quite different from both; manifeſt it is, that they hugely differ each from other, as to the degrees of more or leſſe <hi>objective reality.</hi> For doubtleſſe, thoſe <hi>Ideas,</hi> which repreſent <hi>ſubſtances,</hi> are more ſomething, or (to ſpeak more intelligibly, though more ſcholaſtically) contain in them more of <hi>objective reality;</hi> then thoſe which repreſent only certain <hi>modifications</hi> of <hi>ſubſtances,</hi> or meer <hi>Accidents:</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that <hi>Idea,</hi> by which I ſpeculate ſome <hi>ſupreme Eſſence,</hi> or <hi>Deity eternall, omniſcient, omnipotent, creator</hi> and <hi>conſervator</hi> of this great All, &amp;c. ſeems in ſevere truth, to comprehend more of <hi>objective Reality,</hi> or <hi>Formall Verity,</hi> then ſuch poor Ideas that carry onely the ſhadowes of ſome ſubordinate, dependent
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49051:30"/>
and finite ſubſtances. Now evident it is, by the <hi>light of Nature,</hi> that there muſt be ſo much at leaſt, (if not more) in the <hi>Cauſe efficient</hi> and <hi>Total,</hi> as is in the <hi>effect</hi> of the ſame Cauſe. For, I demand, from what can the <hi>effect</hi> derive its reality, but from the <hi>Cauſe?</hi> and how can the <hi>Cauſe</hi> bequeath that to the <hi>effect,</hi> which it ſelf is deſtitute of? Out of which root ſpring two branches of ever flouriſhing truth. (1.) <hi>Nihil à nihilo fieri,</hi> nothing can be made by nothing. (2.) <hi>Id quod magis perfectum eſt, hoc eſt, quod plus realitatis in ſe continet, fieri non poſſe ab eo, quod minus perfectum eſt,</hi> A more perfect ſomething, <hi>i. e.</hi> which imports more of objective reality, cannot be produced by a leſſe perfect ſomething. So that I may ſafely infer, that this poſition hath not its verity reſtrained to thoſe effects onely, whoſe <hi>Reality</hi> is <hi>Actual,</hi> or <hi>Formal;</hi> but extended alſo to thoſe <hi>Ideas,</hi> in which is conſidered only their <hi>Reality objective.</hi> For example; a ſtone, that never was before, cannot only not now begin to be, unleſs it be produced by ſome other thing, which in it ſelf hath formally and eminently what ever is included in the perfect or full nature of the ſtone; nor can heat be introduced into any ſubject, that was not formerly hot, unleſs by ſomething of equal perfection, or at leaſt equivalent to heat: but, beſides all this, there cannot be in me the Idea of a ſtone, unleſs that Idea be firſt inſerted into me by ſome cauſe, wherein there is ſo much, at leaſt, of reality, as I conceive to be in the ſtone, or in the heat. For though that <hi>Cauſe</hi> transfuſe nothing of its <hi>Actual,</hi> or <hi>Formal</hi> reality into my Idea; yet am not I therefore to apprehend my Idea to be the leſs reall, but that the nature of it is ſuch, that it can require no more reality formal <hi>ex ſe,</hi> then what it borrowes from my <hi>cogitation,</hi> whoſe manner of apprehenſion it is. But that this my Idea, comprehends this or that objective reality, rather then another: this muſt of neceſſity inevitable ariſe unto it from ſome other <hi>Cauſe,</hi> wherein is ſo much at leaſt of reality <hi>Formal,</hi> as the <hi>Idea</hi> contains of <hi>objective.</hi> For if I grant any thing to be found in the Idea, which was not in the Cauſe thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſomething it muſt derive from nothing: but how imperfect ſoever that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus eſſendi,</hi> or manner of being, whereby a thing is <hi>objectively</hi> in the <hi>Intellect,</hi> by an <hi>Idea,</hi> or repreſentative, be; yet is it not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49051:31"/>
wholy nothing, and cannot therefore proceed from nothing. Nor have I any cauſe to ſuſpect, that ſince the reality, which I conſider in my Ideas, is onely objective; that therefore the ſame reality cannot be formally inherent in the cauſes of them: but that it is ſufficient to their nature, that it be in them only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively. For as that <hi>Modus eſſendi objectivus</hi> belongs to thoſe <hi>Ideas,</hi> by the charter of their own peculiar nature; ſo doth that <hi>Modus eſſendi ſormalis</hi> properly belong to their cauſes, (at leaſt to the principal and grand cauſe) by the law of their eſſence.</p>
                  <p>Further though I allow it poſſible for one <hi>Idea</hi> to produce <note place="margin">Article 5. A firme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, that its impoſſible for any Idea to import or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend more of perfection, then its proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type, or cauſe.</note> another; yet I can never heer admit a poſſibility of a progreſs <hi>in infinitum,</hi> of unravelling the pedigree to a length ſo immenſe, as never to goe ſo high as the <hi>Adam,</hi> or Grandfather Idea, but muſt at length arrive at the <hi>Ne ultra,</hi> or firſt Idea, whoſe cauſe is the <hi>Archtype</hi> or <hi>Protoplaſt,</hi> wherein all that reality is inherent <hi>Formally,</hi> which is in the Idea only <hi>objectively.</hi> So that by the light of Nature, I read this unalterable Axiome; <hi>that thoſe Ideas or Images of other natures, or entities, which are in my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, are certain Counter-parts, or reſemblances, which, in truth, come ſhort of the perfection of thoſe objects, from which they were deſumed, and cannot be conceived to contain any thing greater, or of more perfection then their Cauſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From hence my thoughts advance to this concluſion. If the <note place="margin">Article 6. And therefore, if any Idea con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain more of perfection then can be found in our minds: certainly our minds cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e the efficient of that tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent Idea.</note> reality <hi>objective</hi> of any Idea be ſo great and excellent, that I may be aſſured the ſame cannot be in me, either <hi>Formaliter,</hi> or <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenter;</hi> and therefore I cannot be the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of that <hi>Idea:</hi> by direct and genuine inference I determine, that <hi>I am not alone in the World, but that there is exiſtent in the univerſe ſome other Being, which is the father of this Idea.</hi> For if I finde no ſuch Idea occur to my minde, in earneſt I know no argument, that may make me confident of the exiſtence of any one thing diſtinct from my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Now among theſe <hi>Ideas</hi> (that I may range them into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct <note place="margin">Article 7. The diverſity of Ideas, reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities.</note> orders reſpective to the ſeverall <hi>Degrees</hi> of <hi>Entities</hi> from which they reſult, or are derived) there is one which holds forth <hi>me</hi> to my ſelf (concerning which no difficulty can be ſtarted, as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49051:31"/>
to the concernment of the preſent <hi>Demonſtration)</hi> another which repreſents <hi>God;</hi> others which pourtray things meerly <hi>Corporeal</hi> and <hi>Inanimate;</hi> others which deſcribe <hi>Angels;</hi> others reſemble <hi>Animals;</hi> and finally others that ſhew me other <hi>men</hi> like my ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>As for thoſe <hi>Ideas,</hi> which repreſent <hi>Men, Animals,</hi> or <hi>Angels;</hi> I eaſily underſtand, that ſuch may be compoſed and made up <note place="margin">Article 8. The poſſible originals of each ſort ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and all found to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumable from our ſelves; the Idea of God only excepted.</note> of other Ideas, which I uſually conceive of my ſelf, and other corporeall Entities, and of God: though there were neither Men, nor Animals, nor Angels, in the whole World beſide my ſelf. And as for thoſe of <hi>Corporeal Entities;</hi> in them I meet with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo great, noble, or excellent, which ſeems not to have its fountain or origin in my ſelf. For when I make a deep and ſtrict inquiſition into them, I diſcover, that of thoſe things, which they comprehend, there are only very few, which I clearly and diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtand; ſuch are <hi>Magnitude,</hi> or <hi>Quantity</hi> extended into its three dimenſions of <hi>Longitude, Latitude, Profundity; Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure</hi> ariſing from the termination of that extenſion; <hi>Situation</hi> of parts, or that poſition, which parts variouſly figurated obtain and hold among themſelves; and <hi>Motion,</hi> or the change of ſituation in the whole, or parts compoſing the whole: to which may be ſuperadded <hi>Subſtance, Duration,</hi> and <hi>Number.</hi> But as for other things, as <hi>Light, Sounds, Odors, Sapors, Heat, Cold,</hi> and other <hi>tactile qualities;</hi> theſe fall not under the comprehenſion of my thoughts, but darkly and with as much obſcurity as confuſion: inſomuch that when I have ſumm'd up all I know of them, it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to no more then this; that I am even ignorant whether they be true or falſe, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> whether ſuch Ideas, as I conceive of them, be the <hi>Ideas</hi> of things <hi>really exiſtent,</hi> or of <hi>Non-entities.</hi> For though I have faithfully obſerved, that <hi>Falſity,</hi> properly and moſt emphatically ſo called, or <hi>Formal falſity,</hi> can be no where found in the world, but in our <hi>judgments,</hi> or <hi>determinations:</hi> yet is there another <hi>Material falſity</hi> in our Ideas, when they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a <hi>Non-entity</hi> for a real <hi>Entity,</hi> a nothing in ſtead of a ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Thus, to exemplifie, the repreſentations which I have of <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Cold</hi> appear ſo narrow, dim, and confuſed; that my moſt intenſe and acute ſpeculations cannot acquire from them
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49051:32"/>
any plenary and ſtable ſatisfaction, Whether <hi>cold be only a priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Heat,</hi> or <hi>Heat no more but the privation of Cold;</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both be <hi>real</hi> and <hi>poſitive qualities,</hi> or neither? and ſince there can be no <hi>Ideas,</hi> but as of <hi>real</hi> entities; in regard it is a truth apparent, that cold is nothing elſe but a privation of heat, that ſame Idea, which exhibi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s cold as ſomething real and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, may juſtly be reputed falſe: and ſo likewiſe may others of the ſame ſeries. To ſuch Ideas therefore it is not neceſſary, that I aſſigne any other original beſides my ſelf; for ſince they may be <hi>materially falſe, (i. e.)</hi> repreſent nothing under the diſguiſe of ſomething: it is declared unto me by the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> that they proceed from nothing, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> that no other reaſon can be given, why they are in me, but only this; <hi>that ſomething is wanting to my nature, which is requiſite to make it abſolutely perfect and compleat:</hi> and if they were true, yet in reſpect they exhibit ſo litle of reality, that I cannot, in the moſt abſtracted contemplation, clearly diſtinguiſh that <hi>litle</hi> from <hi>nothing;</hi> I ſee no reaſon, why they may not worthily be counted the Minervas of my own brain, or the productions of my own thoughts. Now as concerning thoſe things, which are clear and diſtinct in the <hi>Ideas</hi> of <hi>Corporeal Natures;</hi> I have diſcovered, that ſome of them alſo be derived from the Idea of my ſelf: ſuch are <hi>Subſtance, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Number,</hi> &amp;c. of the ſame claſſis. For when I conſider a ſtone to be a ſubſtance, or an entity conſtituted in a capacity of ſubſiſting <hi>per ſe;</hi> and at the ſame time conſider my ſelf alſo to be a ſubſtance (although I conceive my ſelf to be <hi>Res cogitans,</hi> a thinking ens, and look not upon my ſelf as <hi>Res extenſa,</hi> a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative or extenſive; but upon a ſtone, as <hi>Res extenſa,</hi> and not <hi>cogitans,</hi> and that therefore there muſt be a great diſſimilitude between theſe two conceptions: yet they ſeem to be reconciled and ſhake hands <hi>in termino ſubſtantialitatis)</hi> and alſo when I conſider, that I now am, and formerly have been; and when I have various cogitations, whoſe number I comprehend: I then acquire the Ideas of <hi>Duration</hi> and <hi>Number,</hi> which I can after transfer and apply to what other things I pleaſe. But for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue of particular things, whereof the Ideas of <hi>Corporeal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> are compoſed: as <hi>Extenſion, Figure, Situation,</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>

theſe have not their reſidence in me (ſince I am nothing elſe, in propriety of eſſence, but <hi>Res cogitans) formaliter:</hi> and yet, in relation that they are only certain <hi>Modi ſubſtantiae,</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dificated ſubſtance, and I alſo am a <hi>ſubſtance;</hi> they ſeem to be comprehended in me <hi>eminenter,</hi> by way of <hi>tranſcendency.</hi> And ſo there remains unexamined only the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> in which I am to conſider, whether it include any thing, which cannot be derivative from my ſelf.</p>

                  <p>Nor can it be objected that the <hi>Idea</hi> which I conceive of <hi>God</hi> is <hi>materially falſe,</hi> and therefore poſſible to be deſumed from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as thoſe Ideas of <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Cold</hi> formerly examined: for on the contrary, in this intereſt, that tis tranſcendently <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>diſtinct,</hi> and comprehends more of <hi>objective reality,</hi> then any other Idea, which the minde of man can either conceive, or create; no one is more <hi>true per ſe,</hi> nor in which leſs ſuſpicion of falſhood can be detected. This Idea, I ſay, of the ſupreme Being, perfect and infinite, is moſt true; for though it might be imagined poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that there is no ſuch entity exiſtent, as my Idea repreſents: yet cannot it be imagined, that the Idea of this <hi>Ens ſummum</hi> can exhibit unto me nothing real, as may the Ideas of Heat, Cold, &amp;c. Moreover, I am confirmed, that this Idea of <hi>God,</hi> is of all others the moſt <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>diſtinct;</hi> for whatever of reality, veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and perfection, I clearly and diſtinctly perceive in all other Ideas, is radically concentred in this one, as in the Archtype, or univerſal fountain. Nor can this my beleif be ſtaggered by this weak objection, that I cannot comprehend an infinite, or that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe Attributes mentioned in the deſcription of this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excellent Idea, there are myriads of other <hi>Excellencies</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> which are too reſplendent and remote to be gazed upon by the weak and purblind eye of mans underſtanding, and too numerous to fall under the ſhort Arithmetick of reaſon, much leſs to be epitomized or decyphered in the unequall landskip of my cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: for I know full well, that it is of the nature of an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, not to be comprehended by me, that am finite; that it is ſufficient for me to underſtand only ſo much, and to judge all thoſe things, which I perceive to contain, or import any perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and perchance innumerable other dignities, of which I am yet ignorant, to be in God either formally, or eminently.

And I am anſwered from my domeſtick oracle, the <hi>Light of Nature;</hi> that not one of thoſe illations can ſtand. For, firſt, though it be true, that my knowledge may by degrees be very much multiplyed; and that many things are in <hi>potentia</hi> in me, which are not yet awaked into their proper operations: yet not one of all thoſe properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the <hi>Idea</hi> of God, in which there is nothing at all <hi>Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial;</hi> for this very condition, to be capable of augmentation by degrees, is an undeniable argument of imperfection.

And laſtly, I perceive that the <hi>objective eſſe</hi> of an Idea cannot be produced by a bare <hi>potential eſſe,</hi> which (to ſpeak like a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſician, and properly) is a meer nothing: but only by an <hi>Actual,</hi> or <hi>Formal.</hi>

                  <p>Now albeit there is not one among all theſe notions, which to my retired and circumſpect conſideration, doth nor appear a moſt

Whether or no I, who have this Idea, could have an exiſtence, if there were no ſuch Ens as my Idea adumbrates, really exiſtent?</hi> To particular; from what original ſhould my being deſcend? either from <hi>my ſelfe,</hi> or my <hi>Parents,</hi> or ſome other eſſences of perfection infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely inferior to that of God; for no phanſie can be ſo wild, as to feigne any thing more perfect then, nay not equally perfect with him. Now had I received my being from my ſelfe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly I ſhould not then have been ſubject to thoſe frailties of <hi>Dubitation</hi> and <hi>Deſideration,</hi> nor would any thing have been wanting to my nature: for at the ſame inſtant, when I gave to my ſelf a being, aſſuredly I ſhould have given unto my ſelf alſo all thoſe perfections, whereof I have the Idea in my mind, and ſo I my ſelf ſhould have been God. Nor am I bound to conceive, that thoſe <hi>excellencies,</hi> wanting to the accompliſhment of my nature, can be more difficult to acquire, then thoſe graduall abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, of which I am already maſter: for on the contrary, tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that it muſt import infinitely more of difficulty for me to have had a being, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> for a <hi>Cogitant ſomething</hi> to be deduced from <hi>nothing,</hi> then for me being once conſtituted in a <hi>Capacity,</hi> to attain to the cognition of many things, whereof I am now actually ignorant, which can be eſteemed no more but the <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> of that <hi>ſubſtance.</hi> And aſſuredly, had I borrowed the greater, my <hi>ſubſtantiality,</hi> from my own ſtock of power; I ſhould not have denied unto my ſelf the leſs, thoſe <hi>Accumulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> or accidentall additions, nor any other of thoſe divine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, which I underſtand to be included in the Idea of God: why? becauſe no one of thoſe ſeem more difficult to be acquired; and if any were more difficult for me to aſpire unto, tis more then probable I ſhould underſtand that difficulty,

if I had thoſe <hi>Faculties,</hi> of which my nature ſtands poſſeſſed, from my own donation, in reſpect I ſhould find my power to be terminated in them. Nor doe I evade the convictive rigor of theſe reaſons, if I adventure on this ſuppoſition; that I have been ever heretofore, as I now am: as if the induction of this hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis would be, that therefore I am to trace the genealogy of my eſſence no higher then my ſelf, or ſeek out no other cauſe of my Exiſtence; for in reſpect that all <hi>time</hi> may be divided into innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable parts, each whereof hath no neceſſary dependence on the reſt, either precedent, or ſubſequent; from hence, that I have formerly been, is no valid conſequence that therefore I muſt now be, unleſſe ſome other cauſe be admitted, which dothfreſhly create me in each of thoſe particles, or atoms of time, and particularly in this inſtant moment, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> doth conſtantly conſerve me in being.

                  <p>This doubt I muſt welcome, and honour, as the laudable <note place="margin">Solution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by three diſtinctions.</note> effect of that due veneration, or noble zeal, which ought to be

kindled in every breſt, upon the ſenſe of that immenſe diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt the inviſibility, infinity, and incomprehenſibility of the Creator; and the narrow extent, or, indeed, the comparative nothing of the Creature; nor can I think the debaſement of our own limited nature, other then a pious and worthy cognizance of the majeſty and incircumſcription of his: yet to ſatisfie, that none can have a more lively apprehenſion of his own frailties, infirmities and defects, nor a greater eſteem of the excellencies and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments of God, then my ſelf; and that I more then once look't upon, and throughly examined the weight of this ſcruple, long before I thought it ſafe to acquieſce in the Affirmative, I thus anſwer.</p>
                  <p>An <hi>Infinite, quatenus an infinite,</hi> can, in troth, by no means <note place="margin">1.</note> be <hi>comprehended;</hi> and yet nevertheleſs it may be <hi>underſtood:</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as clearly and diſtinctly to underſtand the nature of any thing to be ſuch, as that no limits, terminations, or circumſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons can be found therein; is clearly and diſtinctly to underſtand the ſame to be infinite.

Thus when we caſt our eyes upon the Sea, though our

ſight cannot extend to all and every part thereof, nor meaſure every inch of its immenſe vaſtity; yet may we be properly ſaid to behold the ſea. And if we look upon it at a great diſtance, ſo that our eyes ſeem to take it in all at once, we doe not ſee it but dimly and confuſedly, as it were in a thin, blew landskip; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo we doe not imagine a Chiliagon but obſcurely and in fractures, when we comprehend all the lateral lines thereof at once: yet if we approach the ſea at a very vicine diſtance, and earneſtly fixe our eyes upon any one part thereof, ſuch a viſion may be clear and diſtinct, as alſo may the imagination of a Chiliagon, if our Phanſie extend to no more, then one or two of the ſides thereof at once.

To deſcend to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. (1.) When by the word <hi>God,</hi> you underſtand a <hi>Subſtance; Reaſon,</hi> not any Idea, aſſures you, that God doth <hi>exiſt: Subſtance</hi> and <hi>Exiſtence</hi> being twins, that cannot live but conjoyned hand in hand.

From the notion <hi>Infinite, (i. e.)</hi> ſomething that you cannot comprehend nor imagine any limits, or extremes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſo as that your thoughts can ever arrive at a <hi>Ne ul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ra:</hi> there ariſeth unto your mind an Idea not of an <hi>Infinity divine;</hi> but of the termination or circumſcription of your finite nature. (3.) <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent</hi> ſounds no more then this, that you cannot conceive, or imagine any cauſe or original of God: from whence tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that from the terme Independent, you can collect no other Idea, but the memory of your own Ideas, which had their ſeveral
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49051:41"/>
originations at ſuch and ſuch times, and therefore are dependent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wherefore, to ſay that God is independent, is nothing more then that God is in the number of thoſe things, of which you can imagine no original, or Cauſe: as alſo, to ſay that God is infinite, is all one, in the import, with this, that God is in the catalogue of thoſe things, wherein your thoughts can diſcover no end limitation, or circumſcription. And thus every Idea of God is excluded; for what Idea can there be, without either original, or termination? (4.) <hi>Superlatively Intelligent;</hi> here we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be informed, by what kind of Idea you underſtand the Intellection of God? (5.) <hi>Moſt potent;</hi> here alſo we require by what Idea you can underſtand potency, which imports things in <hi>futuro</hi> only, and therefore not exiſtent? undoubtedly we aſcend to the cognition of power, by the ſteps of Memory, and reflexion upon former actions, progreſſing by the conduct of Ratiocination, thus; thus he hath done, ergo he had power thus to doe, ergo being ſtill the ſame, he hath power to doe the like again in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Now all theſe are Ideas, which may be extracted from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal objects. (6.) <hi>Creator</hi> of all things; we can pourtray to our ſelves a certain reſemblance of a <hi>Creation,</hi> by drawing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions of thoſe things we have ſeen with our eyes; as when we imagine a man beginning and growing as it were from a point to that figure and magnitude, which he hath in his full ſtature or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility: nor are we perſwaded that any man can have other Idea then this, at the word Creator; but yet that we can imagine the world to be created, is no obliging argument to prove the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And therefore, though it had been demonſtrated by you, that ſomething <hi>Infinite, Independent,</hi> &amp;c. doth <hi>exiſt;</hi> yet could it be no genuine inference, that therefore a <hi>Creator</hi> doth <hi>exiſt;</hi> unleſs you ſhall adventure to undertake the juſtification of this argument; ſomething is exiſtent, which we beleive to have crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all things beſide it ſelf; ergo the world was once created by that ſomething. In fine, when you affirme that the Idea of God, as alſo of your own Soul, is <hi>implantate</hi> in and <hi>congenial</hi> to your <hi>Eſſence,</hi> we deſire to be inſtructed, whether the ſouls of men, when they ſleep moſt profoundly and without dreams, exerciſe their faculty of <hi>Cogitation;</hi> or more plainly, whether they <hi>think?</hi>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:49051:41"/>
if no, then at ſuch times they have no Ideas: and therefore no Idea can be innate, or congenial, for what ever is <hi>innate,</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>preſent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the <hi>firſt part</hi> of this <hi>objection</hi> I anſwer in general; that no one of thoſe Attributes, which belong to my Idea of the <hi>ſupreme</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Solut.</note> 
                     <hi>Being,</hi> can poſſibly be deſumed from <hi>External objects,</hi> as from an original, or primitive exemplar: becauſe in God we can find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which holds any analogy, or ſimilitude to thoſe things that are in <hi>Corporeal Entities;</hi> but whatſoever we contemplate in our Ideas that is diſſimilar or diſproportionate to corporeal natures, that muſt proceed not from them but from the cauſe of that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity in our cogitation. And here I demand, how any man can deduce the Idea of the <hi>Intellection</hi> of God from corporeal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects? but what kind of Idea I have thereof, I fully explain, when I ſay, that by an Idea I intimate <hi>all that, which is the forme of any perception:</hi> and who is there, that doth not perceive (the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> calls it a <hi>reflex act of the intellect)</hi> that he doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the nature of this or that object, upon which his cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is acting; and by conſequence, who hath not an Idea of his own Intellection, which by indefinite extending of it, he forms to an Idea of the divine Intellection, and ſo of all other of his Attributes?</p>
                  <p>To the <hi>other part</hi> I return, in breif; that whereas I have made uſe of the Idea of God, which is impreſſed upon the mind of man, as an invincible argument to demonſtrate the exiſtence of God; and that in this Idea ſo immenſe a <hi>Potency</hi> is included, that we may underſtand it to be repugnant to reaſon, if God doth exiſt, that any thing beſides him in the world can exiſt unleſs it be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him, and dependent upon him: it cannot but appear a direct and juſt induction, that the whole world, or all things elſe which are in being beſides God, were <hi>created</hi> by him. To untie the laſt knot concerning the <hi>eclipſe</hi> of this Idea of God, in our midnight ſleeps, when all our Faculties diſappear; it is required only that I advertiſe the Reader, that when I affirme that there is a certain Idea of God <hi>innate</hi> and <hi>congenial</hi> to us, I doe not mean that this Idea is <hi>always obverſant,</hi> or conſtantly held forth to the eyes of our mind; for in that ſenſe no Idea can be innate: but only that we have within us a certain <hi>Faculty</hi> or Power <hi>iſtam</hi>

                     <hi>ideam eliciendi,</hi> of <hi>extracting</hi> it; or that by the dignity of our Eſſence, we are empower'd to ſpeculate that <hi>Impreſs</hi> or <hi>Signature</hi> of the <hi>Deity,</hi> when we convert our cogitations attentively upon it.</p>
                  <p>Though we ſhould applaud your <hi>ſuperſtructure,</hi> that the Idea of God is not to be deſumed from any other cauſe but himſelf; <note place="margin">Article 5. <hi>Object.</hi> 5.

                  <p>When you reprehend this tenent of mine, that the Idea of God engraven on the mind of man, is uncapable either of <hi>Addition,</hi>

or <hi>Subſtraction,</hi> you ſeem to have no regard to that Rule amongſt Philoſophers, <hi>Eſſentias rerum eſſe indiviſibiles.</hi> For an Idea repreſents the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of a thing; to which, if ought be added, or from which, if ought be ſubſtracted, inſtantly it becomes the Idea of another thing. And by reaſon of their ignorance of this truth, the Heathen, not conceiving aright of the <hi>true God,</hi> fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wofull deluſion of framing to themſelves the Ideas of <hi>falſe ones,</hi> and chiefly that of <hi>Pandora,</hi>

But when once we have conceived the Idea of the true God, however more and more perfections may be revealed unto us, which were not formerly known to be in him, yet nevertheleſſe is not the Idea of him therefore <hi>Augmented,</hi> but onely made more <hi>diſtinct</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs:</hi> in regard all thoſe Accompliſhments ought to be compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the ſame Idea firſt conceived, inſomuch as it is ſuppoſed to have been <hi>true</hi> from the very firſt conception. Thus the Idea of a <hi>Triangle</hi> receives no inlargement, when ſeverall proprieties are diſcovered to be therein, which were at firſt unknown. Nor is our Idea of the Divine Nature formed by us in parcels, or by ſenſible additions, out of the various perfections or endowments of the Creatures, amaſſed together, and multiplyed up to the rate of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall: but ſprings up to us in a moment, perfect and entire, from this one root; that we underſtand him to be <hi>an infinite Ens, ſo perfect as to be above all amplification, or acceſſe of more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi>

the work it ſelf, from your rational <hi>Soul,</hi> or <hi>Mind;</hi> is your <hi>Soul</hi> then the Idea? is your <hi>Mind</hi> nought elſe, but <hi>Modus cogitandi,</hi> a certain manner of thinking? can your mind be both the <hi>ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture impreſſed,</hi> and the <hi>ſubjectum impreſſionis,</hi> or matter upon which it is impre'ſt? Credible it is, ſay you, that you are made after the <hi>ſimilitude</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> True, by a <hi>religious Faith</hi> elemented in us by the doctrine of Holy Writ; but how can you make it out from <hi>Natural Reaſon,</hi> vnleſſe you adventure to make God <hi>Hominiforme,</hi> like to man? And wherein can that <hi>ſimilitude,</hi> or <hi>typicall analogie</hi> conſiſt?

Nay, with <hi>Moſes</hi> in the cleft of the rock, have you ſeen ſo much as his back parts; ſo that you are able to deſcribe his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and make good the Compariſon? But you averre, that tis credible for this reaſon, <hi>Quia creavit;</hi> now we retort upon you, that tis therefore incredible: ſince there is no neceſſity that the Work ſhould be like its Maker, unleſſe in the point of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> where the <hi>Production</hi> receives a communication of the ſame nature, that is in the <hi>Productor:</hi> but you were not Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God, nor becauſe he was your Efficient, can you ſafely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, that therefore you are participant of his Nature; but you were onely created, faſhioned by him, according to the exemplar or Idea, which was in the <hi>Divine Intellect</hi> from all eternity. So it remains, that you have no more juſtifiable pretence, to affirm that you are like him; then an <hi>Engine</hi> hath to be thought to bear the image of the <hi>Engineer,</hi> then a <hi>houſe</hi> hath to be conceived like to the <hi>Maſon,</hi> or <hi>Carpenter</hi> that built it.</p>
                  <p>Further, (not to ſuperſede a jot of your own ſenſe, which may conduce to the illuſtration of your Poſition) you ſubjoyn, that you plainly perceive the <hi>ſimilitude</hi> twixt God and Man, when you underſtand your ſelf to be an <hi>Ens incompleat, dependent</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome ſuperiour Principle, and indefinitely aſpiring to <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>better</hi> things: now in our judgement, this is an undeniable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of a vaſt diſparity and <hi>Diſsimilitude,</hi> ſince God, on the

contrary is moſt <hi>complete,</hi> moſt <hi>independent,</hi> moſt <hi>ſelf-ſufficient,</hi> as being <hi>Maximus &amp; Optimus.</hi> In very ſooth, a <hi>Compariſon</hi> 'twixt <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> 'twixt <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> 'twixt <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> 'twixt a <hi>Spirit</hi> and a <hi>Body,</hi> 'twixt <hi>Something</hi> and <hi>Nothing,</hi> may be better endured; as importing infinitely leſs of <hi>Abſurdity,</hi> infinitely leſs of <hi>Impoſsibility.</hi> In fine, it cannot ſound leſſe then a Miracle, that other men ſhould not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the ſame that you doe; and chiefly when there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon alleadged, why we may not beleive, that God hath impreſſed the Effigies of his Eſſence upon others, as well as upon you. We profeſs, this one argument convinceth us, that the Idea of God is not impreſt upon the mind of man, immediately by himſelf, as a <hi>ſignature,</hi> or <hi>Characteriſm</hi> to confeſſe our Creation; <hi>viz.</hi> that if it were, the <hi>Impreſs</hi> would be one and the ſame in all men; that all men would then conceive God under the ſame <hi>Form</hi> and Idea; would allow him the ſame <hi>Attributes;</hi> would have the ſame thoughts of him in all points. But that all Nations, Ages, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, nay and Perſons have had various and diſtinct Ideas of the Divine Nature: is ſo manifeſt upon the oath of Experience, that we may well here be ſilent, as to any other atteſtation.</p>
                  <p>When you require me to prove, that the Idea of God is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt upon the mind of man, as a <hi>Mark</hi> or <hi>Signature</hi> ſet by the <hi>Maker</hi> upon the <hi>Work</hi> of his hands; and what is the <hi>Manner</hi> of that <hi>Impreſſion;</hi> or what the <hi>Form</hi> of that <hi>Mark:</hi> I appeal to the deciſion of any ſober Arbiter, whether it be not the ſame thing, as if, when I had ſurveyed an excellent <hi>Picture,</hi> and depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended ſo much rare art and exquiſite skill therein, that I could not judge it to be drawn by any hand but that incomparable one of <hi>Apelles;</hi> I ſhould affirm that this <hi>inimitable Artifice,</hi> or <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> never to be paralleled, was a certain <hi>Mark,</hi> or note of Diſtinction, ſet by <hi>Apelles</hi> to all his pieces, whereby they may be diſcerned from the ruder draughts of other pencils: and you ſhould notwithſtanding preſs me to tell you, what's the Form of that Mark, or Manner of that Signal? Doubtleſs, ſuch a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion deſerves no other anſwer but a ſmile.</p>
                  <p>Again, to purſue the ſame adequate <hi>Simile,</hi> put the caſe, that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49051:44"/>
I ſhould averre, that the ſingular <hi>Art,</hi> and unrivald skill, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by as an infallible ſign, the <hi>Pictures</hi> of <hi>Apelles</hi> are diſtinct from the courſer paintings of all others in the World; is nothing real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinct from the Pictures themſelves; and that you ſhould ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill at my aſſertion, and by irregular Logick inferre, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe <hi>Pictures</hi> are nought elſe but the <hi>Artifice</hi> or <hi>Skill,</hi> in an <hi>abſtracted acception,</hi> and ſo are compoſed of no matter: <hi>Ergo</hi> they are onely <hi>Modi pingendi,</hi> certain manners of painting, &amp;c. Would not your argument be equally both as juſt and acute, as when you ſhall thus reaſon; If there be no diſtinction between the Idea of God engraven on your <hi>Mind,</hi> and your mind the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> to <hi>recipient</hi> of this engravement; then is your Mind the Idea, and your ſelf nothing but <hi>Modus cogitandi,</hi> then are you both the <hi>Mark</hi> impreſt, and the <hi>ſubject</hi> of the Impreſſion? I profeſs ſincerely, after a due perpenſion, I cannot determine, which of the two <hi>Inductions</hi> carries the greater weight in the impartial ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of right reaſon: ſure I am, that the <hi>Analogie</hi> ſtands fair and even in all points.</p>
                  <p>Nor can your Contradiction of that vetuſt and almoſt Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Article, <hi>Hominem eſſe Dei Charagma,</hi> that man is made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Image of God, founded upon a collection of thoſe various particulars, whereby the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> is diſcrepant from the <hi>Divine,</hi> be found more Dialecticall, or perſwaſory, then this fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe prepoſterous <hi>Enunciation.</hi> If any Picture drawn by <hi>Apelles</hi> did ever exactly reſemble <hi>Alexander,</hi> then was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> in all parts exactly like that Picture: but the Picture was made up of ſeverall different ingredients or materials, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Colours, oyle, wood, verniſh, &amp;c. and <hi>Alexander</hi> compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of skin, fleſh, bones, hair, &amp;c. Ergo, no picture was ever like <hi>Alexander,</hi> the Diſparity between his nature, and the nature of a Picture, being ſo great, as never to be reconciled in a full analogie. For every temperate brain knows full well, that it is not required to the <hi>Formality</hi> of an <hi>Image,</hi> or <hi>Pourtracture,</hi> to be the ſame in <hi>all points</hi> with the <hi>Antitype,</hi> or <hi>Original;</hi> but onely that it reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in <hi>ſome:</hi> and we all ſubmit to this Manifeſt, that that moſt <hi>perfect Faculty</hi> (ſo I ſpeak as not being ignorant, that all the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes</hi> of God are in him <hi>Actually;</hi> but wanting a word more
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49051:44"/>
ſignificant and convenient to this notion) <hi>of cogitation,</hi> which we underſtand to be in <hi>God,</hi> is in ſome ſort fitly repreſented by that <hi>imperfect one,</hi> which is in <hi>Man.</hi> Further, I cannot but point ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely at your imprudence, in choſing rather to compare the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Man by God, with the Mechanick operation of a Maſon, or Carpenter, then with the Generation of a Parent; ſince no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of reaſon can juſtifie that unmannerly Conſerence. For though thoſe three manners of acting, <hi>Creation, Generation, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brefaction,</hi> ſtand a whole <hi>Genus</hi> wide of each from other, and can never be brought neerer then the ſwords point: yet to argue from a Production <hi>Natural</hi> to a <hi>Divine,</hi> is, by a whole climate, a neerer way, then from an <hi>Artificial.</hi> Again, (to leave no point of a ſcruple unreſolved) though I have long ſince aſſented, that the reſemblance betwixt <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> is not ſo great as that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a <hi>Parent</hi> and his <hi>iſſue;</hi> yet cannot I be brought to hold it impoſſible, that an <hi>operation</hi> ſhould ever be inriched with the <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figies</hi> of the <hi>operator;</hi> ſince Experience whiſpers me, that I have ſeen a <hi>ſtatuary</hi> carve his own ſtatue, out of white Marble, aſwell in the proportion and ſymmetry, as lineaments of each part, ſo exquiſitely reſembling, that every common-eye knew him aſwell by his Statue, as his ſtatue by him.

If they goe farther, and affirm, that <hi>Nature is nothing but the primitive Conſtitution of the World, which reſulted from the caſual ſeparation, conflux, and diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its material principle, Atoms; and that it doth conſtantly perſiſt in the ſame Method, which it firſt obtained from Fortune:</hi> the anſwer is eaſie, that though Nature be conſtant to that order, in all her productions, which the World obtained in its firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure; yet how ridiculouſly ſtupid muſt he be, who can admit a ſerious perſwaſion, that the bodies of Animals, in the beginning could be ſo exquiſitely configurated by meer Chance, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the direction and indeed the deſignement of an infinite <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi> in whoſe eternal intellect the <hi>prototypes</hi> of each <hi>ſpecies</hi> were firſt adumbrated?

Let us ſink our meditations yet one degree lower on the ſcale of <note place="margin">Article 3.

                  <p>Firſt <hi>by the univerſal Convenience of its ſituation.</hi> For had it been placed in any other orb, either inferior, or ſuperior to its <note place="margin">1.

To particular; had the Sun been ſetled in the loweſt ſphear, and obtained that place, which the Moon now poſſeſſeth: the year had been no longer then a moneth; for in that account of time, it muſt have fulfilled its courſe through every part of the Ecliptick, and ſo the intervalls of ſeaſons had ſuffered ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, that muſt have been repugnant to their inſtitution, <hi>i. e.</hi> muſt have prevented the production of all things; For the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praxis, or Counter-activity of contrary ſeaſons, immaturely ſucceeding one upon the neck of another, deſtroys the principles of Vegetation, and checks the promotion of ſeminalities.</hi> Again, by this unſafe vicinity, or too neer approach to the globe of the earth, its intenſer beams had verified the Conflagration of Phaeton; at leaſt proved ſo intolerable, as that all things muſt have had the ycie and glutinous temper of the Salamander, or elſe been tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified into cynders; and to have had no Sun at all, had been the eaſier miſery. For if there be (and ſome are poſitive there muſt be) an intention and remiſſion of heat, reſpective to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent points, or acceſs and receſs of the Sun, in its proper orb;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49051:55"/>
and that in its <hi>Apogaeum,</hi> or mountee to the higheſt point in Cancer, the heat is not ſo ſcorching under that Tropick on this ſide the Aequator, as on the other ſide, in its <hi>Perigaeum</hi> or ſtoop to the loweſt point of its excentricity in Capricorne: we cannot with any pretext of reaſon doubt, that, had the Sun been lodged in the bed of the Moon, it had long ſince anticipated the general combuſtion of the laſt day, and calcined all things to the exiguity of their primitive Atoms. And on the other extreme, had the Sun been appointed to the eight or higheſt ſphear; then muſt it have been, by reaſon of the exceeding ſlow motion aſſigned to that ſphear, ſo manythouſand years in the abſolution of its courſe, as that it muſt have extended one year to the compute of <hi>Platos</hi> Jubile; nor could the world (if learned men gueſs aright concerning its duration) have attained to the period of one revolution. Beſides that Hemiſphear, which firſt faced the Sun in the beginning of its tedious gyre, muſt have enjoyd the curſe of a long long day, and conſequently have miſt the fertile bleſſing of a viciſſitude, or reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal ſucceſſion of diſtinct ſeaſons; but the oppoſite Hemiſphear muſt have, for many myriads of ages, continued as cold, dark and barren as the grave, and ſo half of the earth had been made to no purpoſe. And the like diſcommodities, though more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, would have ſucceeded to the earth, had the Sun obtained a ſituation in any one of the other ſix orbs, between the two former extreams.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>by the appointment of its Circumrotation.</hi> For had <note place="margin">2. The appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its continual Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumgyration.</note> it remained fixt and not moved at all; then muſt the world have wanted that neceſſary diviſion of times and ſeaſons, of Spring and Autumne, Summer and Winter, day and night: and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, the generation and conſervation of things dependent on thoſe viciſſitudes of Heat and Cold; it being neceſſary, that the fixation of this Luminary muſt have cauſed a perpetual ſummer in one hemiſphear, and as laſting and diſconſolate a Winter in the other; or driven nature upon the exigent of making another Sun to irradiate and cheriſh the oppoſite half of the earth, it being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally true (and therefore advanced to the dignity of an Axiome by <hi>Galilaeo, Philolaus, Niceron, Kircherus,</hi> and other

junior Maſters in the <hi>Opticks) that no ſpherical luminous body, of what diameter ſoever, can project its light upon the whole ſphear of another at once, or in a fixt poſition; though it illuminate more then the half of a leſſer placed at convenient diſtance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>by the contrivement of its oblique motion along the line</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. The contrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique motion along the line Eclipitick.</note> 
                     <hi>Ecliptick.</hi> For had its revolution been aſſigned to any other circle; diſcommodities no leſs fatal then the former had unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably enſued. <hi>Firſt,</hi> had it ſayled along on either ſide the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator,</hi> ſome parts of the earth could have known no Sun at all, but ſhould have groand under the oppreſſion of perpetual frigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and opacity; while others had ſuffered the contrary extream of an everlaſting noon, and been parched by the violence of its too conſtant and perpendicular beams: and ſo the whole had been inhabitable; an <hi>Alternation</hi> of <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Gold</hi> being indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſably requiſite aſwell to the <hi>Conſervation</hi> and growth of all things in their <hi>Individuals,</hi> as to their <hi>Propagation</hi> in <hi>Specie. Secondly,</hi> had it been confined to the conduct of the Aequator; firſt unto a parallel ſphear, or ſuch who have the Pole for their Zenith, its revolution could have made neither perfect day, nor perfect night; for being in the Aequator, it would interſect their horizon, and be half above, and half below it: and to thoſe, who inhabite under the Aequator, though it made a diſtinction of day and night, yet would it not make any conſiderable diſtinction of ſeaſons; for the Sun being always vertical to them, in that ſituation, would have introduced a conſtant Summer, and the perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of its unremitted heat have exhauſted the fructifying humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the earth, and ſo left the womb of our common mother, ſqualid and barren as the deſert <hi>Sarra</hi> in <hi>Africa. Laſtly,</hi> had it moved directly upon the Aequator, unto what poſition ſoever; well might it have deſcribed a day, but never meaſured out a year: for the progreſſion of it from Weſt to Eaſt (by the compaſs of which motion the circle of the year is conſtituted) had been wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; in regard that tis impoſſible that on one and the ſame circle, obſerving the ſame Poles, the Sun ſhould have performed its two contrary motions, one from Eaſt to Weſt, which defines the day, the other from Weſt to Eaſt, which meaſures out the year, both at once<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now all theſe palpable inconveniences (with many
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49051:56"/>
other firſt obſerved and enumerated to us by a <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and lately moſt elegantly explained by an <hi>Engliſh Phyſician;</hi> both which ſelected this choice ſubject, as an impregnable argument of the <hi>Wiſdome of the Creator)</hi> were artiſicially praevented by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Suns motion along the Ecliptick, and the obliquity of its annual progreſs upon the Poles of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> full 23 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and an half from the Poles of the World.</p>
                  <p>Now this meditation naturally applies it ſelf, and ſo clearly demonſtrates the forecaſt and artifice of an infinite Intelligence; that I have nothing left to ſay, but this; that tis a wonder, which nothing but the deluſion of the Father of lies can make out to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leif, how <hi>Epicurus,</hi> being a Philoſopher, in many abſtruſities of nature acute enough, nay beyond moſt of his Tutors, as <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> teſtifies of him; and one that pretended to ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight in the problems of Aſtronomy, as to be able to ſalve all the <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> or Apparitions above the Terraqueous orb, <hi>(in Epiſt. ad Pythoelem)</hi> could yet be ſo infatuated, as to aſcribe the compoſure, and location of the Sun, and the invention of its regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and to all parts convenient motion, to the <hi>Temerity</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitancy</hi> of <hi>Fortune.</hi> Nor could I have conceived it poſſible that ſo much of the <hi>Scholar,</hi> and ſo much of the <hi>Fool</hi> could have at once met in one and the ſame brain; had not I been perſwaded thereto, by the agreeing teſtimonies of many credible Authors, high both in Antiquity and Fame.</p>
                  <p>If theſe Arguments reach not, we may deſcend yet lower (if there be any thing low in Nature) and from the entrals of our <note place="margin">Article 4.

could notwithſtanding by a ſpontaneous direction meet and unite in that juſt number, which was ſufficient to make up the Globe of the <hi>Earth,</hi> requiſite to compoſe the body of the Sun, proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to the dimenſions of the <hi>Moon,</hi> equal to the ſeveral orbs of thoſe radiant Centinels of night, the <hi>Stars,</hi> whoſe multitude ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the figures of Arithmetick, and their magnitude never yet rightly explored; in fine, exactly accommodate to the great bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the <hi>World,</hi> whoſe bounds we know not, and whoſe dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are immenſe? The conviction of this impoſſibility they have endevoured (though by running into as great a one) thus to evade, As he (ſay they) muſt have been deceived, who having obſerved the generation of nothing greater then a <hi>Flea,</hi> could not therefore beleive the generation of an <hi>Elephant,</hi> as if there could not be found matter enough to ariſe to ſo gigantick a body: ſo are we deceived, while regarding the generation of onely ſmal things we beleive that the great body of the univerſe could not be made up by the ſame means, and after the ſame manner; as if ſo vaſt a proportion of matter could not concur and unite into one Form; nay by ſo much the more are we deceived, by how much the more proportion the matter of a Flea holds to that of an Elephant, and the matter of an Elephant holds to that of the World; then the matter of the World holds to that maſs of Atoms, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in the infinite ſpace. But I may with good reaſon demand, how they can be aſſured, that in the imaginary ſpace, without the circumferrence of the world, there is ſuch an inexhauſtible abyſs of matter, as ſufficeth to the generation not onely of this world, but of an infinite multitude of others, fully as large as this: ſo, well as we are aſſured, that in this world is contained matter ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to the compoſition of an Elephant, as well as of a Flea? Sure I am, no man ever ſaw the outſide of the world; and if ſo, is it not a meer Rhodomontado of phanſie, or (as <hi>Pliny</hi> calls it) a high madneſs, to imagine ſuch an infinite abyſs of matter? Let us, however, deal with theſe, as wiſe Phyſicians with Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driacks, that they may the more eaſily cure them, allow them their abſurdities; and grant that from eternity there was ſuch an infinity of Atoms, confuſedly hurried to and fro, in an infinite ſpace: yet the difficulty will always remain, how in ſo great a laxity and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49051:57"/>
infinite liberty of range, ſo many Atoms could ſo convene and combine together, as to terminate and ſetle each other, by reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal coherence and mutual concatenation; how ſo orderly marſhal and diſpoſe their ſeveral diviſions into ſuch elegant Figures: how adapt thoſe figures to ſuch genuine and conſtant operations; and all this without the counſell, diſpoſition, and revinction of any other cauſe, but their own rude and giddy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity to motion, and the caſual reſult of their ceſſation from diſcord? That <hi>Animals</hi> have obtained ſuch exquiſite forms, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective to their ſeveral deſtinations; this we can refer to the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of their peculiar <hi>Seminalities,</hi> or the cunning of that <hi>Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive virtue,</hi> which lying ambuſcadoed in the ſpumous conſiſtence of their genital emiſſions, and being once awakened into Activity by the excitement of a convenient <hi>Matrix,</hi> or <hi>Receptarie,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately deſignes this or that parcel of matter for ſuch or ſuch a part, another for another, and ſo ſpins it out into an uniform la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth of members, at laſt weaving all thoſe into an ingenious <hi>Figure,</hi> in all points reſembling the Protoplaſt or firſt genitor of that ſpecies; who received this <hi>Seminal Tincture,</hi> or faculty prolifical from the immediate bounty of its <hi>Creator.</hi> But that <hi>Atoms,</hi> as they are in their naked and incomplex nature, ſhould be allowed to have a <hi>Plaſtick</hi> or <hi>fabrefactive virtue</hi> equal to that conferred upon the ſeeds of Animals; is a ſigment as worthy our ſpleen, as that ridiculous branch of the ſame root the <hi>Autocthonous,</hi> or ſpontaneous eruption of our firſt Parents from the confermentation of <hi>Water and Earth,</hi> and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of mankinde like that of Muſhroms: which whimſey is alſo entituled to <hi>Epicurus,</hi> by no meaner a tradition then that of <hi>Cenſorinus (de Di.

                     <p>From an <hi>Agent infinite in Wiſdome, Power, and Liberty,</hi> ſuch as we muſt allow <hi>God</hi> to be, no account either of <hi>Motives, Means,</hi> or <hi>Time,</hi> ought to be required. It was, according to their meaſure of time, about ſix thouſand years from the nativity of the Univerſe, when the unhappy diſciples of <hi>Epicurus</hi> diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated this uncivil interrogation: but had it been created many myriads of myriads of thouſands ſooner then it was, tis open to conjecture, that they would have inſiſted on the ſame ſawey de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; ſince eternity compared to more myriads of years, then all the figures of Arithmetick can amount to the computation of, muſt yet import a vaſt tract or ſlux of <hi>Time</hi> (for other idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome to expreſs this notion, I could not either recognize, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitate) below the foot of that accompt; and that precedent ſpace might have afforded room enough for the intruſion of the ſame frivolous quaere. And therefore it becomes us, either not to enquire, why the world was produced, rather then not produced; or allowing its production, to eſteem it all one, whether it were produced then, before, or after, in this ſo great a latitude of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. For the ſame queſtion now propoſed, why God did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine in himſelf to create the World, ten millions of years ſooner then he did; may alſo be revived hereafter, concerning theſe times of ours, if another rand of ten millions more ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravelled. From whence this modeſt and truly humane leſſon fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infers it ſelf; that it is oraculous in the greateſt wiſdome to ſay, <hi>God Created the World in that article of eternity</hi> (we may now call it <hi>Time) which ſeemed moſt opportune to his Wiſdom.</hi> For, that he had ſome important reaſons ſo long to deferr the creation, and then onely to contrive and finiſh it, when he did; though thoſe reaſons be cryptick and ignote to us: we may more then

                        </gap> upon profound reaſons of State, the knowledge whereof is never diffuſed among their ſubjects, but lockt up in the cabinet of their own heart: why may not <hi>God,</hi> who is all <hi>Counſel</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> be afforded the prerogative of having ſome weighty reſpects, that moved him to create the World, then when he did, rather then either ſooner or later? Which reſpects, for ought we can explore, is <hi>Mercy</hi> in him to conceal from us: ſure I am, tis a pride not much beneath, if not equal to that of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> in us to dare to enquire. Tis a confeſt truth, that no man can know the thoughts of another, who is conſtant to his reſolve to reſerve them ſealed up within his own breaſt; and can any man be ſo incurably over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run with the itch of vanity, when he deſpaires of pretending cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to divine the cogitations of his familiar friend, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations he hath ſo frequently read in the book of his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: yet to arrogate to himſelf an ability of ſearching into the abſcondite counſels of him, whom neither <hi>Minde</hi> nor <hi>Senſe</hi> can touch? Wherefore tis our duty to reclaim our wild curioſities, to ſet bounds to our inquiſitions, and gratefully ſate our boulimie of ſcience with this wholſome morſel; that from hence, that the World was once created, we may ſafely inferre, that the <hi>Creator</hi> was pleaſed to declare himſelf ſo <hi>Potent,</hi> that no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment could intervene betwixt his eternal decree, and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune execution thereof: ſo <hi>Free,</hi> as to be above the impulſion or conſtraint of any neceſſity: ſo <hi>Wiſe,</hi> as to prevent all temerity and colluſion of Fortune: ſo <hi>Good,</hi> that the preſcience of mans fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ingratitude, and ſo the infertility of his maſterpeice, could not dehort him from fulfilling his purpoſe of conferring that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable bleſſing of <hi>Exiſtence</hi> both upon him, and all things elſe for his ſake.</p>

and refute it ſelf.

                  <p>Tis an Apophthegme fathered (and that not unjuſtly) upon <hi>Epicurus; Facere ſapientem omnia ſui cauſſa,</hi> that a wiſeman <note place="margin">Article 3. The ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry refutation thereof; and <hi>Gods glory</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted to have been his prime and principal end.</note> in all his actions doth principally regard himſelf. And could not this learn his Scholars more diſcretion, then to doubt, whether or no <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Elixir of wiſdome,</hi> in this weighty operation had an eye upon himſelf, or reflected upon his own concernment? The Word, <hi>God,</hi> to a metaphyſical conſideration, contains reaſons more then enough to decide this idle controverſie, excited only by a predominion of <hi>ſenſuality.</hi> For when there was nothing exiſtent beſides himſelf; tis plain, that he could gratifie nothing beſides himſelf: and as he not only derived the power of operating from himſelf alone, but alſo was the <hi>exemplar</hi> to himſelf; ſo alſo muſt he be the principal <hi>End</hi> of his operation. The <hi>End</hi> I ſay, <hi>non utili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis;</hi> as if his <hi>Eſſence</hi> were capable of <hi>melioration,</hi> his <hi>Beatitude</hi> ſo remiſs, as to admit of <hi>Augmentation,</hi> his <hi>Condition</hi> ſo imperfect, as to be improved by <hi>Alteration: ſed gloriae,</hi> which as he could not want, ſo was there no reaſon why he ſhould want. Such was the Freedom of his Will, that no neceſſity could conſtrain him to the production of any thing; ſuch the Bounty, that none could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain him from the voluntary profuſion of his goodneſs. When twas indifferent to him, or to conſtitute a World, or to continue alone; he yet was pleaſed to follow the propenſity of his own
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49051:66"/>
infinity Benignity, and to create: inſomuch as he judged it better that there ſhould be other natures beſide his own, to which he might impart the overflowings of his goodneſs; then not. <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> I ſay, not for <hi>himſelf;</hi> for as the perpetual <hi>Emanation</hi> or <hi>diffuſion</hi> of his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> upon the creature, ſince time (the <hi>Image of eternity,</hi> as <hi>Plato</hi> (in <hi>Timaeo)</hi> deſcribes it) began, hath not diminiſhed: ſo could not the <hi>Concentration,</hi> or <hi>Confinement</hi> of it to the orb of his own eſſence, have leſſened his <hi>Felicity;</hi> which hath <hi>Plenitude</hi> and <hi>Conſtancy</hi> for its ſupporters, and is therefore raiſed above the imperfections of <hi>Acceſs</hi> or <hi>Change.</hi> And upon this perſwaſion (I cannot forget to ſpeak after the manner of men) he vouchſafed to conſtitute all other natures that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his own; and more eſpecially Man: not that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any emolument from them, ſince himſelf is all goodneſs, and by conſequence all glory; but that, conferring reſpective en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments upon them, he might have convenient ſubjects, whereon to exerciſe his immenſe liberality and make known his magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. That ſince the creation he expects from man the retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Reverence, Adoration,</hi> and <hi>Obedience;</hi> ariſeth not <hi>ex in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digentia,</hi> from any need he ſtands in of, or benefit that redounds to him by the unfruitfull homage of man: but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </p>
                  <p>And whereas they demand, <hi>Why God, if he take any delight in theſe experiments of his wiſedome, Power, and munificence, would ſo long endure the privation, or rather defect of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light?</hi> The ſolution is obvious, that this kinde of <hi>delectation</hi> is no more then <hi>Accidentary</hi> to him, and can adfer infinitely leſs of addition to that fulneſs of <hi>Beatitude,</hi> formally radicated in his <hi>Eſſence;</hi> then one ſmal drop of water ſuperaffuſed to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity of a million of Oceans. For <hi>ſibi ſufficientiſsimus,</hi> All to himſelf, is his peculiar Motto; ſince he hath the ſource of all that's <hi>Amiable</hi> and <hi>Delectable,</hi> ariſing from, and perpetually
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49051:66"/>
flowing round his own moſt perfect nature, nor can he be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the unequal oblation of humane <hi>Doxologie,</hi> otherwiſe then by reflecting upon his own <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> which freely ordained, formed, and diſpoſed man to that honourable and beatifical duety: and therefore that ſentence of the School Divine, <hi>Quicquid agit praeter ſcipſum, ad alterius commodum ſpectat,</hi> deſerves our grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full aſſent; for all his <hi>Extrinſecall</hi> or <hi>Emanative</hi> operations look <hi>directly</hi> upon the benefit of that Creature, whom he hath adopted to be the object of his Love, which is Man; <hi>obliquely</hi> upon the convenience or accommodation of all other Creatures, neceſſary or adjuvant to the well being of that Favorite; and by <hi>reflexion,</hi> upon his own munificence. And hence is it manifeſt, that he adorned the Univerſe with aſteriſms, and beautified the heavens with radiant lamps; not that he might better his own habitation, which is impoſſible, he being a manſion to himſelf, and his eternal condition being extreme felicity: but provide a more commodious place of reſidence for men, for whoſe ſake principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (after that of his own Glory) he intended the Creation, He, doubtleſs, could want the illumination of neither Sun, nor Moon, whoſe dwelling is in light inacceſſible; nor be enriched by the faint ſplendor of the Stars, whoſe glory is ſo refulgent, that we hyperbolize the luſtre of the Meridian Sun, when we define it to be the ſhadow of its Creator; and ſince thoſe ſhining orbs are but pale tapours kindled at his more ſplendid abyſs of light, how infinitely more lucent muſt his eſſence be, who is deſcribed by ſome to be <hi>Superſubſtantialis Lux? (Athanas Kircher in metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic. Lucis &amp; umbrae, Epichiremate</hi> 5.) Nor can we ſay leſs of that admirable <hi>variety of forms,</hi> wherewith we obſerve both ſtories of the World to be adorned; for if they appear ſo full of <hi>Elegance</hi> and <hi>beauty;</hi> how incomparably more fair and amiable muſt their <hi>Maker</hi> be, who is the <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>Pulchritude,</hi> and by the Analogy which they hold to the comely ideas in his intellect, all things are determined to perfection? For that mighty <hi>Cauſe,</hi> which can give being to ſo many various perfections, muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity poſſeſs all thoſe perfections, <hi>modo eminentiori,</hi> in a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent manner. Wherefore the excellencies of his own nature did, before he was pleaſed to create others, ſo amply ſuffice to the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49051:67"/>
Accompletion of his beatitude; that they now at this day wholly ſuffice to the ſame; nor is he capable of having his Felicity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by the contributions of any thing without himſelf. And ſince all things created, are nought but certain <hi>Emiſsions,</hi> or as it were <hi>deradiations,</hi> which he pleaſed to diffuſe from himſelf; tis perſpicuous, that before that <hi>Diffuſion</hi> he comprehended all natures in his own, as in their <hi>Fountain,</hi> and therefore could not have his being meliorated by their production; as alſo, that he may at pleaſure, adnihilate all again, with no more detriment to his glory, then the Sun can want thoſe beams, which yeſterday it emitted upon my hand.</p>

Now, if by <hi>Wiſe men,</hi> he mean ſuch, whoſe minds are imbued with the maximes of Virtue, and their lives conform to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right rules of morality (who only, in the judgment of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, can challenge that Attribute) then is it not eaſie to doubt, that the beneficence of God was loſt to them, or unadviſedly placed upon them: ſince their opportune, moderate, and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full husbandry of theſe bleſſings, though it cannot be extended ſo high as abſolute merit; may yet reach ſo far as to juſtifie the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their donation, and manifeſt the provident collocation of them upon convenient ſubjects, <hi>i. e.</hi> upon ſuch as make it the conſtant buſineſs of their lives to learn how rightly to uſe them, and practiſe that excellent leſſon, of imploying all things to the temporal ſupportation, comfort, and improvement of themſelves, and themſelves to magnifie the bounty of that hand, that ſo free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſtowed them.</p>
                  <p>And on the other ſide, if by <hi>Fools</hi> he intend ſuch as are dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated from the nobility of their nature, degraded below meer Humanity, that know no good beyond the preſent blandiſhments of ſenſuality, and have ſworn themſelves voluntary captives to their own luxurious Appetites, (and ſuch was the wiſe mans fool) then can neither the Juſtice of God be taxed for conferring ſuch rich favours upon thoſe, that know only how to abuſe them; nor his Praeviſion diſparaged, as not foreſeeing the miſcarriage or unfruitfulneſs of his charity: ſince he left it in the arbitrary power of their Wills to make an election of Good or Evill, to turn to the right hand, and purſue the real and true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of virtue, or deflect on the left, and be loſt in the deviations of the only apparent and falſe pleaſures of vice: having ſet before them the means both of Sapience and Reſipiſcence, and furniſhed them with advantages and opportunities either to acquire more knowledge, or at leaſt recant and diſclaim their ignorance.

ſtolidity of an ignorant hath this uſe, that it ſerves as a foyl to ſet off the ingenuity of the knowing, and by the incompatible diſparity which appears at the conference of thoſe two contraries, infinitely enhanceth the value of wiſdom.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourth,</hi> that the labours of <hi>Agriculture</hi> are ſuperfluous, and voluntarily undergon by man, more for the maintainance of his <note place="margin">4.</note>

But as for <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and the reſt of that miſcreant crew; tis more then probable, that a quite

different intereſt inveigled them into this dangerous error.

                  <p>The <hi>Firſt Argument</hi> they drew from the apparent <hi>incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of buſineſs and happineſs;</hi> or more plainly, from the vaſt <note place="margin">Article 4.

This he contracted into that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; <hi>Quod eſt beatum &amp; immortale, neque ſibi habet, neque</hi>

their tender arguments againſt the opinion of general Providence, with thoſe more ſinewy and vehement reaſons of their profeſt neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality in many other notions; there will offer it ſelf a fair ground for more then conjecture, that they purpoſely contrived them ſoft, gentle, and diſſoluble, that ſo they might ſeem neither to quit their habit of contradiction, nor yet to dare the ſubverſion of that catholick poſition, to which all men (thoſe few of the black guard of Hell, whom we lately nominated, excepted) had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and which the dictates of their own domeſtick oracle, Reaſon, had confirmed as ſacred and uncontrollable.

                  <p>Firſt, I ſay, let us ſet our reaſon a work upon the <hi>nature of the Firſt Cauſe,</hi> or <hi>Eternal Being;</hi> and order our cogitations thus.

Since tis impoſſible to cogitate any perfection, which is not the eſſential propriety of ſome Nature: and to think any Nature more perfect then the <hi>Divine,</hi> plainly abſurd; becauſe we conceive that to be moſt perfect, or elſe we do not conceive it to be <hi>God; God,</hi> and <hi>Abſolute Perfection being one and the ſame thing,</hi> and ordinarily conceived as one notion. Now, to be ſo inſinitely <hi>Wiſe, Potent,</hi> and <hi>Good,</hi> as to order all things in the world to the beſt, to regulate and predetermine the operations of all ſecond Cauſes, to keep Nature her ſelf ſober and in tune<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo prevent thoſe diſcords, which otherwiſe would in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſucceed to the reduction of all to a greater confuſion then that of the Chaos; in a word, to conſerve all things in exiſtence: this no man will deny to be a <hi>Perfection,</hi> ſince we define the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection

Wherefore let us not ſuffer our cogitations to acquieſce in this imperfect, but vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly advance to that <hi>moſt perfect Nature,</hi> whoſe propriety it is to be at once both <hi>ſupremely Provident,</hi> and <hi>ſupremely Beate.</hi> And ſince we conceive <hi>God</hi> to be ſuch, it is of neceſſity inevitable, that we grant <hi>

                  <p>Nor can it, with ſafety, or honour to our judgements, be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that God might, had he ſo pleaſed, have conſtituted the World in ſuch abſolute perfection, as that from the minute of its complete exiſtence it might have continued <hi>independent,</hi> and to all eternity have ſubſiſted <hi>by it ſelf,</hi> and all its appointed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have conſtantly, without intermiſſion, or variation, ſucceeded by the direction of their bequeathed impreſſions, without the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous moderation of his care, or the minutely ſupply of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, ſince the Univerſe, according to the Grammar of ſound Philoſophy, is no <hi>Noune Subſtantive,</hi> and enjoyes <hi>reality</hi> only by a <hi>diſtinction: i. e.</hi> is <hi>ſomething by dependence upon him, who was eternally contrary to nothing;</hi> and being, at that inſtant, when <hi>Omniety</hi> informed <hi>Nullity</hi> into <hi>exiſtence,</hi> educed out of nothing, by the ſingle <hi>Fiat</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and thence forward continued to be ſomething by the continued Power of the Creator: muſt unavoidably revert to nothing again, if the perſeverance of that identical power be ſubſtracted, from which it once obtained to be ſomething. And as <hi>Light</hi> cannot ſubſiſt, if ſeparated from a <hi>lucid body;</hi> but inſtantly vaniſhes into opacity: ſo cannot the World (which is but a reflexive deradiation from that <hi>Light,</hi> which is inviſible) continue, if the perpetual ſourſe of that mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous <hi>Virtue,</hi> which upholds its exiſtence, be withdrawn, but muſt immediately vaniſh into nothing.

new ſomething may ſtart out of the ruines of an old ſomething. But the World which was nothing before the fruitfull voyce of <hi>Elohim</hi> called it into ſomething, hath nothing from it ſelf to ſubſiſt upon; but muſt therefore, in the twinckling of an eye, become nothing again, unleſs its exiſtence be ſupported and maintained by the conſtant recruit of the ſame <hi>miraculous Power,</hi> which firſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it. I ſay, the ſame <hi>miraculous Power;</hi> for the <hi>Creation</hi> doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs was the greateſt <hi>miracle,</hi> that ever was wrought: it being more difficult to turn <hi>Nothing</hi> into <hi>all things,</hi> by the bare <hi>nutus</hi> or <hi>vote</hi> of the <hi>Firſt Cauſe,</hi> then to produce an extraordinary <hi>effect</hi> by inverting the uſual method of <hi>Secondary Cauſes;</hi> a harder wonder to make <hi>Nature</hi> herſelf, then to praepoſter, or tranſcend her cuſtomary rules of acting, to the cauſation of an effect either againſt, or above her ſelf. Though to ſpeak rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and as men that underſtand ſomething of <hi>Theoſophy;</hi> nothing can be a miracle to him, to whom all things are not only of equal <hi>poſsibility,</hi> but of equal <hi>facility</hi> alſo. When therefore we ſay, that <hi>God is the Cauſe of the world;</hi> we are to underſtand him to be ſo in the ſame relation, that the <hi>Sun</hi> is the <hi>Cauſe of Light:</hi> and by conſequence, as the <hi>Light</hi> diſappears in the Aer, when the <hi>Sun</hi> diſcontinues its <hi>Actinoboliſme</hi> or deradiation in our hemiſphear, by viſiting the lower; ſo alſo muſt the <hi>World</hi> diſappear and be loſt in adnihilation, when <hi>God</hi> ſhall pleaſe to diſcontinue his influx of minutely <hi>Creation,</hi> or (to ſpeak more conform to our praeſent ſcope, though it ſignifie the ſame thing in height of truth) to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termit his <hi>Providence.</hi>

For, as the firſt preſerves from ſhipwrack, the ſecond from deviation and ſubverſion, the third from diſcord, the fourth from poverty and deſolation, the fifth from diviſions, and the laſt from confuſion: ſo doth the wiſe overſight of God regulate the efficiencies of all <hi>Natural Agents,</hi> with ſuch admirable politie, that the whole is preſerved in ſafety, in the direct road that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the general end, in harmony, in proſperity, in union, in perfect order.</p>
                  <p>To draw a line yet more parallel; we every day obſerve in the ſad experiments of death, what a leaden and unweildly maſs of clay the <hi>body</hi> becomes, ſo ſoon as its ſprightly Tenant, the <hi>Soul,</hi> hath ſurrendred to corruption; and it needs not much proof, that the <hi>Soul</hi> of this gigantik <hi>body,</hi> the Univerſe, is <hi>God:</hi> therefore when this ſoul ſhall withdraw and ceaſe its Animation, muſt that body fall by its own weight, and ſuffer diſſolution.</p>
                  <p>Not that therefore, in ſtrictneſs of ſenſe, or without the latitude of a metaphor, <hi>God</hi> is a <hi>Soul,</hi> and the <hi>World</hi> his <hi>Body;</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the informing and actuating Preſence of God is as abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to the vitality of the World, and the moderation of all its parts in the due execution of their diſtinct offices, as the Preſence of a ſoul to the animation of a body, and the regulation of all its members in the requiſite adminiſtrations of their ſeveral functions.</p>

To paint a <hi>Sound,</hi> is a far eaſier task, then to deſcribe the imperveſtigable manner of <hi>Gods operations:</hi> and to deny the poſſibility of that, whoſe reaſon we cannot explore, is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim our ignorance of any nature more perfect then our own; and that upon conſequence, is to make our nature more imperfect then really it is, by rendring it uncapable of the greateſt <hi>Truth;</hi> nay, of that truth, upon whoſe certitude, the aſſurance of all poſſible cognition doth neceſſarily depend.

Either this <hi>Neceſsity</hi> muſt be impoſed upon them by <hi>Fortune;</hi> or by <hi>themſelves;</hi> or by ſome <hi>other principle,</hi> which hath the free donation, and ſo the limitation of all thoſe priviledges or Faculties.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> not by <hi>Themſelves;</hi> for there is in every thing a kind of native Ambition to ennoble its nature, enlarge its power, nay (ſo much as in it lies) to mount even to infinity, according to that Axiom of <hi>Scaliger (Exercit.</hi> 9. <hi>pag.</hi> 52.) <hi>

Can wee conceive, that a <hi>Plant</hi> would continue fixed and nayled down by its own roots to the earth, and there live a cold, dull, unactive life; if it could give to its ſelf motion and abilities for nobler actions? That a <hi>Beaſt</hi> would be conſtant to the groſs and heavy operations of meer ſenſe, ſubmit to the burdens, and endure the tyrannous op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of man; if it could endow it ſelf with the prerogative of Reaſon, and ſo become equal to his imperious Lord? Or that man would ſit down quiet, and remain ſubject to the infirmities, calamities, and mortality of his nature; if he had any hopes to better it, to wind up himſelf to heaven, and there take the wall of Cherubins, nay rival the calme felicity and immortality of God? For ſo invincible a reluctancy have we againſt the neceſſity of our frailties, and ſo unceſſant hormetick a deſire to be above them, by the melioration of our ſtate; that we may truly accommodate to our pride, what the eloquent <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpake to expreſs that of ſome of the Roman Emperours; <hi>ſi ipſi ſe Deos facere potuiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, certè quidem homines nunquam fuiſſent,</hi> could they have made themſelves Gods, doubtleſs they never would have been men. Seeing therefore, that tis repugnant to that inſatiable <hi>Appetite</hi> of <hi>Melioration,</hi> even to infinity, radically inherent in every entity create, though (I confeſs) ſcarce perceptible in bodies devoid of Animation; to deny to it ſelf any perfection, which is in its own power to give, or acquire: what clearer evidence can be expected, to enſure our reaſon, that the <hi>Ampliation,</hi> and <hi>Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of all <hi>Natural Faculties,</hi> or endowments, is not in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary diſpoſition, or elective power of <hi>Finite eſſences;</hi> and, by conſequence, that the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Propriety,</hi> or the reſtriction of every

                  <p>This conſidered, it remains indiſputable, that the <hi>Diſtribution</hi> and <hi>Aſſignation</hi> of thoſe different <hi>Qualifications,</hi> being neither in the power of <hi>Fortune,</hi> nor of the <hi>Things</hi> that enjoy them: it muſt properly and ſolely belong to that <hi>ſupernatural Infinite,</hi> which is the fountain of <hi>Being, Life, Senſe, Locomotion</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and therefore had the power freely to give them; being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the <hi>Collocation</hi> of them by the meer invitement of his own <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> and directed in the convenient <hi>Diſtribution</hi> of them by the Counſel of his own <hi>Wiſdome.</hi>

                  <p>Upon theſe and the like perſwaſions many of the moſt learned <hi>Rabbines,</hi> and after them not a few of our modern <hi>Divines,</hi> have concluded; that at the Deluge the Floudgates of this <hi>Tehom Rabba,</hi> were unlockt, and the waters being ſhowred down in Cataracts upon the earth, ſwell'd the deluge above the mountains. This, indeed, ſeemed ſmooth and plauſible to my firſt apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and promiſed not only to ſatisfy, but compenſate my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer anxious diſquiſition: but when I had a little recovered my thoughts out of the pleaſant ſurpriſe of the novelty, and caſt about, by what conveyances or <hi>Aquaeducts</hi> the tides of this <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceleſtiall Ocean</hi> might be tranſmitted through ſo many <hi>Orbs</hi> (which not a few great <hi>Clerks</hi> have affirmed to be <hi>Solid)</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſlocation of any one, at leaſt without interrupting or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding their regular Circumvolutions; which happend not, for the ſtars kept on their Courſes, as the retrograde Calculations of their ſeverall Periods will ſoon evince: as alſo, if they were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, <hi>what became of them afterward,</hi> when the fourty days were over?

When, I ſay, I had abated the edge of my Credulity with theſe occurring difficulties, I ſadly relapſed into my former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certitude.

If it be objected upon me, that God put a period to all <hi>Creation</hi> after the firſt Hexameron or ſix days; I ſhall defend my ſelf, with the barrel of Meal, and cruiſe of Oyle, that ſuſtaind the Widow and her ſon in the famin of Zarephath; wherein there was a freſh Creation of two ſeveral <hi>ſubſtances,</hi> with all their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſical <hi>Accidents</hi> about them every day; or a tranſmutation of Aer into Meal and Oyle, which was equivalent. And as for the other harſh term of Adnihilation, I ſay tis equally facil to him to reduce any thing to, as to educe it from Nothing. But this might well have bin ſpared, it being my proper buſineſs to prove that the Deluge was <hi>not Naturall;</hi> not to digreſs into a diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition how or by what cryptick means twas <hi>ſupernatural.</hi>

                  <p>Now to me, this proceſs of Argumentation ſeems ſo ſmooth, familiar and cuſtomary, and the whole ſeries of Inductions ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to a dialectical conſideration; that, when I reflect upon the facility of their occurence to our thoughts, I cannot but extremely wonder, how ſo many profound and circumſpect Philoſophers, and thoſe whoſe threads of life were unraveld in the eager purſuit of knowledge, could referre the ceſſation of Oracles to <hi>Natural neceſsities,</hi> and acquieſce in a confidence of thoſe weak, remote, inconſiſtent, impertinent and ſo contemptible <hi>reaſons,</hi> urged by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> &amp;c. to ſalve the difficulty of this accident, and ſerve as a ſpecious <hi>Aſylum</hi> for their puzled curioſities to retreat to.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, that that generally confeſt <hi>Eclipſe of the Sun,</hi> (and, indeed, the only one this great Luminary did ever ſuffer; ſince <note place="margin">Article 13. That the Eclips of the Sun, at the death of Chriſt, was purely <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical,</hi> irrefu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated.</note> we may with more propriety call all others but <hi>Partial Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions</hi> of his light, by the leſſer body of the Moon interpoſed in a ſtraight line to ſome part of the Terreſtrial Globe) which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at the <hi>Death of Chriſt,</hi> was above, nay againſt the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental conſtitutions of Nature; is manifeſt from hence, that on the third of <hi>April,</hi> or <hi>Feria ſexta,</hi> being the Paſſion day, in the year <hi>Aerae Chriſti nati</hi> 33. (which is ſynchronical to the 78. of the <hi>Julian</hi> account) the Sun and Moon were then in <hi>oppoſition diametrical,</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> her ſelf totally eclipſed in <hi>Libra</hi> to the <hi>Antipodes</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> as may be certified to any man that can read the <hi>Celeſtial Ephemerides</hi> backward, <hi>i. e.</hi> recalculate the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riodical <hi>Conjunctions</hi> and <hi>Oppoſitions</hi> of thoſe two great <hi>Lights</hi> of heaven, by the Tables of Aſtronomy. For thoſe <hi>Characters of time</hi> being punctually reſtrained to ſet &amp; certain periods, the Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer may as eaſily attain to the minute of any eclipſe <hi>in praeterito,</hi> as to the preſcience of any <hi>in futuro;</hi> provided that his <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> be ſound, and his <hi>Schemes</hi> erected with exactneſs correſpondent: nay ſuch is the certitude of this rule, as to the ſtrict deciſion of time, that though the Aſtronomer may chance to learn of the Hiſtorian, that there hath bin an eclipſe; yet for the determination of its preciſe <hi>time</hi> &amp; <hi>place, hiſtory</hi> muſt go to ſchool to <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> as <hi>Scaliger (de</hi>

                     <hi>Emendat. tempor.)</hi> hath obſerved to our hands. Thus when <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Dio</hi> had recorded an Eclipſe of the Sun to have falne out a little before the death of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and ſo to have been a kind of prodigy portending the fall of ſo bright a Star; the Aſtronomers coming after to examine the ſynchroniſme, by their retrograde calculations, found the Hiſtorians in a double error: that Eclipſe being not of the <hi>Sun,</hi> but the <hi>Moon;</hi> and not <hi>preceding,</hi> but <hi>ſucceeding</hi> his funerals.</p>
                  <p>To aſſure the miracle yet nearer, let us look back to the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Aſtronomy.</hi> The Eclipſe of the Moon is cauſed by the <hi>Intervention</hi> (for ſo tis according to the moſt probable <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of <hi>Copernicus)</hi> of the opac body of the earth, between her and the original of her light, the Sun; and the Eclipſe of the Sun, by the interpoſition of the Moon betwixt him and the earth: and therefore the Sun cannot be eclipſed, but when he is in <hi>Conjunction</hi> with the Moon; nor the Moon, but when ſhe is in <hi>oppoſition</hi> to the Sun. Yet notwithſtanding doth not every monthly conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and oppoſition of theſe two lights produce an eclipſe to one of the two; but only that <hi>Conjunction</hi> and <hi>Oppoſition</hi> which is <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical: i. e.</hi> when the Central point of the Sun faceth the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral point of the Moon, and that again confronteth the centre of the earth, ſo directly, that an arrow ſhot in a ſtreight line from the circumference of the Sun through its Centre, would alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly transfix the Centers of the other two orbs. And this falls out only when the Moons <hi>Eccentrick</hi> tranſecteth the Suns, in that line, which is for that reaſon called the <hi>Ecliptick;</hi> nor this in more then two points, called by <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> the <hi>Nodi,</hi> or knots, and by the <hi>Arabians,</hi> the <hi>Head and Taile of the Dragon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, theſe <hi>Interſections</hi> are not conſtant to one certain point, or place, but circumgyrated by a ſlow motion, make a circle of 18 years complete; and therefore every 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year the Moon muſt be eclipſed in the ſame degree of the ſame ſigne in the Zodiack, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly to the end of the world: which is the rule by which every common Almanack maker doth calculate his predictions of Lunar Eclipſes.</p>
                  <p>Now this being excogitated, and the eclipſes retrived back as high as the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Either God is willing to amove thoſe evils from good men, but cannot; or can, and will not; or neither can, nor will; or both will and can. If he hath a will, but not a power, then is

If he want both will and Power, then is he both malevolent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent; and by conſequence no God.

                  <p>For though all the works of God carry, in the front of their diſtinct Forms, ſome certain Signatures or Characters, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably atteſt their Creation by an Efficient infinite in Power and Wiſedom; and in that reſpect may be properly enough ſaid, to ſhew forth the glory of their Maker: and though all <hi>Animals</hi> do, by a kind of tacit homage, confeſs their origination from, and conſtant dependence on one <hi>Eternal</hi> and <hi>Omnipotent Cauſe;</hi> yet are they induced, excited, or rather impelled thereunto, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctu ſolum quodam caeco,</hi> only by a blind and confuſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, of which themſelves have no poſſible notion.

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:49051:109"/>
ſo indiviſible ſubſtance: nay ſome modern Enquirers into the nature of the ſoul, have deſcribed it to be, <hi>Actus ſimplex Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitionis omnium, quae cognoſci poſsint,</hi> a ſimple Act, or preſent Cognition of all things intelligible, <hi>i. e.</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, tis not in the power of the moſt deſperate and obdurate Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, to eraſe this idea out of his mind, no more then to change, meliorate, or adnihilate his eſſence, or prevent the ſtroke of Death.

For all men have confuted, diſavowed, or repented that impiety at or before their death, which they ſeemed with ſo much impudence and pride, to cheriſh in their lives.

                  <p>The <hi>Creator,</hi> having formed the machine of mans body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Figure fit to receive the majeſtick charagme of Divinity, as the laſt act of his hand, and the accompletion of his moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Artifice, breathed into him a <hi>Wiſe, intelligent,</hi> or <hi>cogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent Soul;</hi> that by the tranſcendent operations thereof, man might juſtly intitle himſelf to the Empire of the Creatures, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugate them to the dominion of his unconfined Will, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate all things either to the reliefe of his <hi>Neceſsities,</hi> or the promotion of his <hi>Delights.</hi> This done, he ſet before him <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evill;</hi> and this upon the higheſt reaſon: becauſe he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed him with <hi>Sapience,</hi> whoſe baſis is founded in the actual diſcernement of thoſe two Contraries For no man can make an election of the <hi>Better,</hi> and know what's really <hi>Good,</hi> unleſs at the ſame time he know alſo what's really <hi>Evill,</hi> and how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and avoyd the <hi>Worſe.</hi> Thoſe two <hi>objects,</hi> though abſolute <hi>Contraries,</hi> are yet perfect <hi>Relatives;</hi> though irreconcileable Enemies, are yet coſubſiſtent Twins, and live ſo connexed hand in hand, that the ablation of the one neceſſitates the ablation of the other. <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evill</hi> therefore being thus blended together,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:49051:118"/>
and in this miſcellany propoſed to man; then begins that <hi>Criterion, Wiſdome</hi> to exerciſe its Faculties, diſplay its diſcretive energy, and immediately exploring the difference, <hi>affects</hi> the <hi>Good</hi> ſor <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tility,</hi> but <hi>rejects</hi> the <hi>Evill</hi> for <hi>Safety.</hi> As therefore there are innumerable <hi>Goods</hi> offered to the judgement of man, which he may with happineſs enjoy; ſo alſo are there as many <hi>Evills,</hi> which he may with caution abhor. For if there were nothing evill, nothing dangerous, in ſhort, nothing hurtfull to man; pray, what ſtead could his <hi>Reaſon</hi> ſtand him in? And hence is it manifeſt, that whoever ſtrikes at the neceſſity of <hi>Evill,</hi> at the ſame time cuts off the neceſſity of <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> and downright adnulls the uſe of the <hi>Intellect:</hi> ſince if <hi>God</hi> had created no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that might prove noxious to man, to what purpoſe would his <hi>Cogitation, Intellect, Science</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> have ſerved? For then to what object ſoever he had extended his hand, though at adventure; yet would that have bin by nature fit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for him.</p>
                  <p>To illuſtrate this by a familiar, yet in all points reſpondent <note place="margin">Article 4. The ſame illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, by a correſpondent <hi>Simile.</hi>

                     <hi>Example;</hi> if any man make a feaſt for a company of <hi>Infants,</hi> and prepare a liberal table of many both pleaſant and wholſom meats for them; though they are not wiſe enough to make their own choyce, by <hi>rational judgement,</hi> but purſue the inclination of their <hi>Senſual Appetite:</hi> yet can they not chooſe amiſs, all things good and gratefull being praeelected to their hands. And if ſo, of what diſadvantage is their <hi>Ignorance,</hi> or of what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage could their <hi>Intelligence,</hi> were they arrived at ſo much maturity, be unto them? Truely, none at all; for as they could know no want of the one, ſo could they receive no damage by the continuation of the other. But if among thoſe many pleaſant and nutritive diſhes the maſter ſhould mingle as many either <hi>bitter</hi> and diſtaſtfull, or <hi>poyſonous;</hi> then doubtleſs muſt the greedy Wretches be deceived through their ignorance of Good and Evill, unleſs <hi>Wiſdome</hi> ſtep in to their protection, and informe them what is ſafe, and what deſtructive, and ſo direct them in the <hi>Delection</hi> of the one and <hi>Refuſall</hi> of the other. Now clearly the Caſe is the ſame, in all particulars, twixt God and Man, as to
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:49051:119"/>
the point of Good and Evill: and therefore we may conclude, with <hi>Lactantius; Propter mala opus nobis eſſe ſapientia, quae niſi fuiſſent propoſita, rationale Animal non eſſemus:</hi> had there bin no evill for man to avoyd, he never had bin endowed with a rational Soul.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore, let us ſeriouſly examine the inſide of thoſe <hi>Good</hi> things, that are ſhowred down on the laps of Evill men, and make their tides of Fortune high and ſmooth; while the ſtreams of Good mens lives ſeem to run low, ſink down to the loweſt ebbs, and are conſtantly ruffled by the contrary guſts of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Certain it is, that nothing can be affirmed to be <hi>really Good,</hi> but only <hi>Virtue,</hi> or at leaſt that, which being contempered, impregnated and qualifyed by Virtue, doth poſitively conduce to our <hi>Well-being:</hi> and as certain it is, that Evill men want

And this the reaſon is, why thoſe <hi>Bleſſings,</hi> which the bounty of <hi>Providence</hi> hath ordained for our refreſhment and conſolation in this tedious pilgrimage on earth, and furtherances or contributions towards our eaſier purchaſe of immarceſcible Felicity in heaven, when Death ſhall have evacuated our Faith; ſuch as <hi>Vigor, health,</hi> and <hi>beauty</hi> of Body, <hi>ingenuity of diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, longevity, multitude of Friends, equality in marriage, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of iſſue, education in civility and learning, ſcience, wealth, nobility of blood, abſoluteneſs in power and government, &amp;c.</hi> when they come into the polluting hands of <hi>Vitious</hi> men, they inſtantly ſuffer a total caſtration of their <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> a depravation of their <hi>benignity,</hi> and putrify into perfect <hi>Curſes:</hi> the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them raiſing unceſſant tempeſts and diſtracting ſtorms of <hi>Paſſions</hi> in the obnubilated region of their minds; nor permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that comfortable ſun of true <hi>Content</hi> to ſhine clearly forth, and make one faire day, during their whole lives.</p>
                  <p>For though the Mole-eyed multitude, whoſe ſight is always terminated in the gawdy outſight, admire even to envy the luſtre of ſplendid <hi>Vice,</hi> cry up the happineſs of wealth, and beleive that the Rich man, though nere ſo unjuſt and ſinfull, doth every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſurfeit with variety of Delights: yet if his <hi>Conſcience</hi> were ſtrictly examined, twould ſoon confeſs, that all his luxurious <hi>Viands</hi> are but <hi>Pils of Coloqyntida</hi> nearly gilded, or <hi>Apples of Sodom,</hi> whoſe Vermilian rind doth emulate the bluſhes of Aurora, but are within nothing but ſulphureous duſt; that his magnificent <hi>Buildings</hi> are but a more ſtrong and ſpatious <hi>Priſon;</hi> his nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous <hi>Attendants,</hi> but ſo many <hi>plummets</hi> ſuperadded to that oppreſſing weight of cares, which keeps his mind in the perpetual motion of inquietude; his troop of <hi>Adulators,</hi> but a ſwarme of

Faculty of Rationality, either to no purpoſe at all, or at beſt to facilitate our betraying our ſelves into the ſnares of ruine and miſery beyond poſſibility of reparation or redemption; Muſt induce, that the Will being depoſed from her arbitrary throne, the judgement ſeate of Reaſon muſt fall to the ground; nor can there be any room left for <hi>Conſultation</hi> to ſit and determine the debates of the Soul concerning the good or Evil of her objects: ſince notwithſtanding all our moſt profound, ſerious, and prudent <hi>Deliberation,</hi> the ſucceſs of our actions, as well as the reſults of our councels, would then be no other, but what hath bin reſolved on and predecreed by Fate; and then, to conceive our ſelves obnoxious to puniſhment, for incurring thoſe ſins, which are impoſed upon our wills by a neceſſity beyond our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll, is an open derogation to the equity and <hi>Juſtice</hi> of the Divine Nature, and to aſcribe our <hi>Evil</hi> to that, which is by eſſence <hi>ſuperlatively Good.</hi> That <hi>Prudence,</hi> is miſerable <hi>Folly;</hi> the ſtudy of <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> laborious <hi>Vanity;</hi> and all our ancient <hi>Lawmakers,</hi> either ridiculous <hi>Fools,</hi> or deteſtable <hi>Tyrants:</hi> ſince they preſcribe and enjoyne thoſe things, which either we muſt have done, had not they injoyned them, or are reſtrained from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in ſpite of our own conformable inclinations, by the contrary impulſion or ſeduction of Deſtiny. And, finally, that all Divine and Human <hi>Exhortation</hi> to Good, and <hi>Dehortation</hi> from evil, are unneceſſary and ſuperſluous.

to do Good, when 'twas in their power to have done Evil and Diſpraiſe is the due guerdon of thoſe, who chooſe to do Evil, when twas in their power to have done Good. And thus ſhall all our <hi>Prayers</hi> be fruitleſs, our <hi>vowes</hi> hopeleſs, our <hi>Sacrifices</hi> unprofitable, and all other acts of <hi>Devotion</hi> deſperate Vanity.

                  </p>
                  <p>A Fifth, that of the ſame <hi>Author (Pſalm.</hi> 102. <hi>verſ.</hi> 25.) <hi>O my God take me not away in the midſt of my days:</hi> and in like manner, <hi>(Pſalm.</hi> 6. <hi>and</hi> 30. <hi>and</hi> 88. <hi>and</hi> 111.) he with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent importunity ſupplicates, that God would be pleaſed not to cut off the thread of his life, while he was then in the ſpring and vigour of his age, but reſtore him from that languor and marcid Conſumption, introduced by his grievous diſeaſe, to his priſtine ſanity, that he might thereby be enabled to chant his praiſes in the Sanctuary, and do good to the children of Sion.</p>
                  <p>A Sixth, that remarkable Precedent of the prolongation of life beyond the term preſixt, King <hi>Ezechias (Eſai.</hi> 38. <hi>verſ.</hi> 10.) who being infeſted with the moſt mortiferous of diſeaſes, the Plague, and convulſt with the horror of death, denounced by the thundering Prophet; in the intervalls betwixt the ſhowers of heavy tears, he ſighes out this lamentation: <hi>in the cutting off my days I ſhall go to the gates of death; I am deprived of the reſidue of my years. Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a ſhepards tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life (vitam meam veluti textoris telam praecidi,</hi> as ſome read it) <hi>he will cut me off with pining ſickneſs.</hi> Which ſignifies as much as this, that he was adjudged to dye before his time. But this night of ſorrow was diſpelled by a comfortable morn, cauſed by the light of that Sun, which riſeth with healing in his wings;
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:49051:139"/>
for immediately after, his contrition, ſincere reſipiſcence, and earneſt ſupplications obtaining a repreive from the mercifull hands of him, who deſireth not the death of a ſinner, the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of that fatal ſentence was ſuſpended, and a paroll leaſe of 15. years ſupernumerary annexed to that old one of his life, fully, to ſome few anxious minutes, expired. And can any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice be ſo inſlexible, as not to ſtoop to the converſion of this pregnant Example, which on one ſide, teſtifies the poſſibility of the <hi>Decurtation</hi> of the Term of mans Life, by any mortal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; and, on the other, manifeſteth the poſſibility of the <hi>Prolongation</hi> of the ſame, by the ſeaſonable and right uſe of the means conductive thereunto, viz. remorſe of Conſcience, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſupplication, and medical remedies. For, preſcribed it was by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> thus: <hi>Let them take a Bunch of Figgs, and lay it for a plaiſter upon the boyle</hi> (or Carbuncle) <hi>and he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, to bring up the reare of theſe Sacred Arguments, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant on our ſide, let us inſtance in the ſemblably pertinent ſtory of the <hi>Ninivites;</hi> who, by the counter-violence of thoſe holy ſpells, <hi>Penitence,</hi> ſevere <hi>Humiliation</hi> as well of the outward, as of the inward man, and <hi>Prayer</hi> diſtracted with nought but tears and groans, ſeem to have abrogated the Decree of Deſtiny. For the Bowels of <hi>Divinity</hi> yearning with paternal compaſſion towards ſo populous a City; wherein though all were guilty, yet many millions muſt have bin blended in the chaos of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ruine, who were yet too young to ſhare in the <hi>actual</hi> Depravities; ſmoothed the brow of his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and prevailed with him to interpret their univerſal mortification of <hi>Impiety,</hi> as an Allegorical accompletion of his reſolve concerning the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral devaſtation and mortality denounced againſt their <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Habitations;</hi> to accept the ſlames of their thick <hi>ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> as Expiatory and preventive to the impendent Combuſtion of their City; and heighten the wholſome virtue of their <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence,</hi> obſerved in the ſtrict Faſt, to a generous <hi>Prophyla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctique</hi> or Preſervative againſt the <hi>Peſtilence</hi> now ready to be kindled by the breath of his Indignation.</p>
                  <p>Nor are we deſtitute of <hi>Inſtances,</hi> in holy Chronicles, to
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:49051:139"/>
teftify the <hi>Reverſe</hi> part of our aſſertion, viz. That the Term of mans life hath bin <hi>Abbreviated.</hi> For who can read the ſtory of the <hi>General Deluge,</hi> and not obſerve, that the whole ſtock of Humanity (except 8. beleivers, who committed themſelves pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners to the Ark of Preſervation) was immaturely extinguiſhed, and by the moſt proper and expedite way of corruption, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into its <hi>Hyle,</hi> or Watery Principle? Who can rehearſe <hi>Moſes</hi> his relation of thoſe many thouſands of incredulous and murmuring <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> buried in the wilderneſs, to whom God had promiſed, nay ſworn to give them poſſeſſion of the land of Canaan; and not be ſatisfied, that their Rebellion and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity anticipated their funerals? and who examine the fate of thoſe <hi>Cowards,</hi> who being ſent to explore the fertility of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Land, and the forces of the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> returned a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging anſwer to their brethren, and were therefore cut down by the revenging ſword of the Lord of Hoſts, in the noon of their lives; and not be convicted, that the <hi>Wages of Sin is Death,</hi> and may be paied as juſtly, though not ſo naturally, in the morn, or noon, as evening of life?</p>
                  <p>Now ſo fiduciary are theſe <hi>Teſtimonies,</hi> that whoever ſhall juſtly compute their <hi>Number,</hi> perpend their <hi>Gravity,</hi> and clearly diſcern their <hi>Perſpicuity;</hi> muſt confeſs it no leſs then open injuſtice to all the Inducements of beleife, to debaſe them ſo much as to a Competition for the priority of perſwaſion, with thoſe <hi>Few, Light,</hi> and <hi>Obſcure</hi> Allegations, upon whoſe Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit the Factors of <hi>Immoveable Deſtiny</hi> have adventured to take up their opinion. However, that we may add a brighter po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh to this our Gold, by ſcouring off the ruſt of all <hi>Exceptions</hi> made againſt it: it deſerves our time, and ſweat to diſpoſſeſs our <note place="margin">Article 6.

                  <p>Firſt they attempt to infirme our title to that definitive and emphatical ſentence of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, The bloody and deceitfull men ſhall not live out half their days;</hi> and this under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of ſeveral perverſe <hi>Interpretations:</hi> as (1) by underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the place thus; <hi>Impii &amp; ſanguinarii non dimidiabunt</hi>

                  <p>To this unlawfull Conſtruction we reply, that this ſubterfuge was contrived by that profeſt Libertine of Chriſtianity, <hi>Luther,</hi> to the end he might ſupport his doctrine of <hi>Abſolute Fate,</hi> which with ſo much Ardor and Pertinacy he had once maintained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that ornament not only of <hi>Germany,</hi> but of <hi>Europe</hi> alſo, <hi>Eraſmus.</hi> But the Connexion of theſe with the former words, manifeſtly prohibite any ſuch Comment. <hi>Thou, O God</hi> (ſayth <hi>David) ſhalt bring them down into the pit of deſtruction,</hi> i. e. thou ſhalt irretiate or inſnare them, and ſuddainly preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate them into the ſame pit, which they have digged for me, thy ſervant; or thou ſhalt, according to the concernment of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> phraſe, deſtroy them <hi>ſubita praematura morte,</hi> by a ſuddain premature death; that from the experiment of their unexpected ruine, the world may learn thy juſtice, and be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of thy favour and indulgence to the pious, and thy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and indignation to the impious. For if we accommodate this text meerly to the Natural expiration of the term of life, which is appointed as well to the Righteous as to the Reprobate, and generally to all men: pray, what <hi>Energy</hi> or <hi>Emphaſis</hi> can remain to that ſaying of <hi>David, Tu facies eos deſcendere in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teum foveae;</hi> for then we ſhall reduce all the meaning only to this, <hi>illi morientur ſtatuto ſuo tempore, ſicut mortales alii om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> they ſhall dye in their appointed time, as all other mortal men: and if ſo, who might not have juſtly made this retort up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>David; &amp; te etiam tuo tempore, ſive cum finis vitae tuae praeſtitutus aderit, Deus faciet deſcendere in puteum foveae,</hi> and thee alſo, when thy appointed time ſhall come, or when the temperamental leaſe of thy life ſhall be worn out, ſhall God bring inro the pit of deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Again, if we exchange <hi>Negotia</hi> for <hi>Dies;</hi> then muſt we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the appropriation of the ſenſe to the Wicked, and make it common alſo to the Godly. For, who ever lived to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh all his purpoſes? But the expreſſion ſufficiently illuſtrates the intention; for it exactly reſponds to many other phraſes uſed

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">(2) By Tranſlating the Text thus; <hi>Non dimidiabunt dies ſuos,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>peribunt antequàm ſperent:</hi> they ſhall periſh in the immaturity of their <hi>Hopes,</hi> not of their <hi>Lives.</hi> For the ſenſuall <hi>Affections</hi> of their earthly minds having determined their judgements only to the expectation of enjoying bleſſings inſervient to the ſatisfaction of their domineering Concupiſcence, make them promiſe to themſelves long ſubſiſtence in this their paradiſe; nay extend their vain projects as far as the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble period of Eternity: ſo though they ſurvive even life it ſelf, by dwindling out their bedrid days, till the <hi>maraſmus</hi> of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream old age hath embalmed them before-hand, pined them into perfect Skeletons, and ſo defrauded their hungry Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, the Wormes; yet ſince they drop away full of youthfull and green hopes, their departure is premature and inopine; and ſo they may be ſayd, not to dimidiate their days.</p>
                  <p>We return that this illegitimate <hi>Deſoant</hi> ought to be reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for 4, conſiderable <hi>Cauſes.</hi> (1) Becauſe it cannot be juſtly charged upon the words, no not in the greateſt latitude of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.

(2) becauſe it argues the ſacred <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> of a manifeſt <hi>Falſity.</hi> For when the ungodly expire, they do not only <hi>Dimidiate</hi> their days, but <hi>Accompliſh</hi> them, <hi>Death</hi> being at any time the <hi>December</hi> of life. (3) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it imports a double repugnancy to Truth.

And, again, no Chronicle is barren in the ſtories of proſperous Libertines, who have wanted nothing but ſome <hi>Croſs</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deare the Felicity of their lives, have unravelled their vital web in the higheſt blandiſhments of Senſe, attained to miraculous Longevity, and being ſated with the profuſe treatments of Fortune, have outlived their own large ſtock of Hopes; ſo that a Poet might take the Liberty to ſay of them, they dyed for grief, that they had nothing left to wiſh for, which they had not already ſurfetted in the fruition of.

For, if to <hi>Dimidiate</hi> their days, import no more then to dye by the ſame common kind of Death, and at the ſame period of their Temperamental Leaſe, when, by the ineluctable laws of Deſtiny, it is enacted that all men ſhall revert to Duſt: certainly, there can remain no reaſon why Impious men, ſo dying, ſhould be thought more unhappy, becauſe they were Cruent and Unjuſt, then others. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude; of all thoſe juſt Perſons mentioned in the old Teſtament, who were tranſlated from this Vale of tears to the Celeſtial Hils of permanent delight, by early and premature deaths (amongſt whom the <hi>Apoſtle (Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>verſ.</hi> 38.) hath accounted ſome ſo excellent above the common rate of humanity, that <hi>the world was not worthy of them)</hi> of ſuch, I ſay, 'twas true, according to this erroneous paraphraſe, that they did not <hi>Dimidiate</hi> their days, becauſe they dyed ſooner then they expected. For they did not only hope, but upon the faithfull promiſe of God even aſſure themſelves of a longer continuation heer below to do him further ſervice. And confidently to expect, nay by a lively hope to anticipate the fruition of a promiſed bleſſing; is a privilege peculiar only to thoſe, to whom the promiſe doth properly and ſolely belong: but the bleſſing of Longevity was only then promiſed to the pious obſervers of the Divine laws; as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt from the places formerly cited.</p>

For this life is no <hi>Manſion,</hi> but a narrow and incommodious <hi>Inne,</hi> ſtanding in the way to a better, whoſe <hi>Term</hi> is <hi>Eternity:</hi> and therfore, <hi>ter felix ille, cui ante laſſitudinem peractum eſt iter,</hi> thrice happy he, who arrives at his journies end, before he is weary of travell. And our Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers tell us, that old Age is but the magazine of ſorrows, the ſowre Dreggs of life, the Portal to the Noſocomie or Hoſpital of Diſeaſes, and indeed a kind of living-Death, wherein men only <hi>Breath</hi> and <hi>Doate;</hi> which though all men wiſh for, yet no man delights in when it comes: <hi>optima cum expectatur, cum advenit, oneroſa ſibi, aliis moleſta;</hi> good only when expected, evil when enjoyed, becauſe burdenſome to it ſelf, and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to others. So that thoſe Saturnine minds, which were moſt ambitious to wear the ſilver Crown of old Age; when they had obtained it, found it to gall their feeble temples, and enervate all their limbs: nor did they appear other then wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therbeaten and mouldring ſtatues of their former ſelves, Human-Graſhoppers, or Ghoſts walking in Skeletons. In fine, that the whole concernment of this encouragement to Filial Duty, doth conſiſt only in this; that <hi>Vivacity</hi> in this tranſitory World is promiſed unto morigerous Children, only in this capacity, that it is a <hi>Benediction</hi> of God: and a Benediction only in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:49051:143"/>
that it is a <hi>Document of Divine Grace,</hi> or an Evidence of Gods ſingular love toward them; which he doth infinitely more teſtify unto them by a timous and early delivery of them from this calamitous priſon of Mortality into the glorious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Sonnes of God.</p>
                  <p>We reply, that this plea of Exception againſt our lawfull right to the place, is not only frivolous and dilute; but even derogatory as well to the Sanction, as <hi>Excellence</hi> of the <hi>Promiſe.</hi> For, to tranſmute the <hi>ſerious and faithfull promiſe of</hi> him, whoſe words are <hi>yea and amen,</hi> into an <hi>Anthropopathical Sophiſme,</hi> or affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted expreſſion in the ſtammering Dialect of Humanity; is fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous, and not only to ſtagger, but ſubvert the <hi>Fidelity</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and ſo demoliſh the comfortable hopes of <hi>Filial Piety,</hi> nay, what's a degree of <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> to inſimulate <hi>Truth</hi> it ſelf of <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture.</hi> For, to promiſe <hi>Longevity</hi> to morigerous Children, when formerly and without any reſpect to their previſed obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, God hath prefixt unto them an <hi>Intranſible Term</hi> of life: what els can it be, but to make him promiſe that, which cannot be promiſed <hi>Hypothetically,</hi> or upon condition; unleſs that which was <hi>Abſolutely</hi> decreed long before the promiſe was made, be violently cancelled and altered. And ſo much the more intolerable indignity to the ſacred majeſty of God, doth this abſurd Exception infer; by how much the more both of <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence</hi> and <hi>Inconſtancy</hi> it muſt import, to play the uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect Sophiſter with thoſe, who (as our Adverſaries themſelves affirme) ſtood poſſeſſed with a full perſwaſion, that the Term of every mans life was abſolutely, and without any reſpect to his future piety, or Impiety, predetermined. I profeſs ſincerely, I am yet to be perſwaded, that any Credulity can be ſo pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique and ſlaviſh, as to entertain a beleif; that even <hi>Man</hi> (I forbear to ſay, God) can thus openly and detectibly diſſimulate with any the moſt ſtupid and indiſcreet perſon alive; unleſs he be firſt reſolved to expoſe himſelf to the juſt ſcorn and deriſion of all men, and by this looſe and childiſh jugling forfeit that reputation, which he had acquired by his former grave and ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous treaties, and the juſt performance of all Articles, to which he had ſubſcribed.

And ſuch is the quality of thoſe <hi>Bleſſings,</hi> which the Bounty of <hi>Providence</hi> hath by promiſe aſſured unto the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,</hi> in order to the demulſion and dulcification of the ſharp condition of this life; and particularly that of <hi>longevous ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence</hi> upon earth. To conclude; the <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>Form</hi> of a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> doth conſiſt in this, that they, to whom the promiſe is made, do underſtand the good therein ſpecified, to be <hi>really, bona fide, &amp; in ſpecie,</hi> intended to be performed by him, who made the promiſe. Now, if there ariſe any doubt, whether or no that promiſe be repugnant to a verity formerly declared; then doth the force and ſanction, together with the Dignity thereof, totally vaniſh and become voyd.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> have rejoyned, that God doth therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe <hi>Longevity</hi> to obſequious Children, becauſe he hath formerly decreed to qualifie their particular Conſtitutions with reſpective <hi>Durability.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, alas! this ſubterfuge neither diſſolves the Difficulty, nor prevents the Doubt.

For extremely ridiculous it is, to opinion, that God would by a Commination ſuſpended on a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or by a hypothetical decree, make that known; which long before he had, by an Abſolute Decree, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or previſion of any condition, conſtituted firme and immoveable. Unworthy and diſparaging thoughts both of the <hi>Wiſdome</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> of the <hi>Supreme Being</hi> doth that unhappy man entertain, who aſcribes unto it the making of <hi>Decrees</hi>

                     <hi>ſubordinate, diſparate,</hi> and <hi>irreconcileable.</hi> That Sacred, omniſcient, omnipotent Agent, as himſelf makes nothing in vaine; ſo would he have us make him our Exemplar, and doe no action, but what points at ſome certain end, and conduces both to our benefit, and the laſt of ends, his Glory. But <hi>in vain</hi> had he promiſed, in vain threatned, had he either promiſed or threatned thoſe things, which his own irrevocable Decree had formerly made immutable, which muſt of neceſſity, had they never bin promiſed or threatned, have come to paſs in their predetermined opportunity: or ſuch, to whoſe Exiſtence it was wholly and abſolutely neceſſary, that that very thing, under which the promiſe or commination was made, ſhould be effected by ſuch a power, to which no other power can reſiſt.</p>
                  <p>And this (we hope at leaſt) is ſufficient to the ample juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our opinions right to thoſe <hi>Three appropriate and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Teſtimonies,</hi> of the Mobility of the Term of mans life, deſumed from <hi>holy Writ.</hi> ¶.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>It makes no materiall difference</hi> (ſay they) <hi>whether the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of God be conceived precedent to his Preordination of any future Event, and ſo Predeſtination be founded upon Previſion; or,</hi>

                     <hi>on the contrary, this Praeordination precedent to his Praeſcience, and ſo Praedeſtination be the baſis of Paerviſion: for, from the conceſſion of either, it follows of abſolute neceſsity that the Term of mans life (in individuo) muſt be fixt and intranſible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We anſwer, <note place="margin">Article 2. The refutation thereof, by the conciliation of the infallibility of Gods <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notion,</hi> to the indeterminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mans <hi>free will</hi> to the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al election of Good or Evil.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Conſequence,</hi> indeed, ought to be admitted as firme and impregnable. For this <hi>Praeſcience,</hi> whether it praeced, or ſucced <hi>Divine Praedeſtination,</hi> is and muſt be ever certain, prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and infallible; or ſo ſuppoſed to be, at leaſt: and therefore muſt the <hi>Term</hi> of mans life be conſtituted certain, preciſe, and immutable, <hi>ex neceſsitate ſi non conſequentis, ſaltem conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi> by neceſſity if not of the <hi>Conſequent,</hi> yet of the <hi>conſequence; i. e.</hi> if not from the <hi>Virtue</hi> or <hi>Efficiency,</hi> yet from the <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> or <hi>Conditionality</hi> of that <hi>Praeſcience.</hi> For no Sceptick can diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of this Conſequence; if God doth infallibly foreknow, that this and no other ſhall be the Term of my life: <hi>ergo</hi> this and no other ſhall be the Term of my life.</p>
                  <p>But this is not the point, at which our inquiry is levelled. Manifeſt it is, aſwell from our precedent diſcourſe, as from the Condition of the ſubject, that theſe two Propoſitions are not repugnant each to other; viz. The Term of mans life is fixt and immutable in reſpect to the infallibility of Gods Praeſcience: and the Term of mans life is moveable in reſpect to our right uſe, or abuſe of the Liberty of our Will. Though, I confeſs, with the great <hi>Merſennus,</hi> that the apparent diſcord betwixt the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Gods Prenotion, and the indetermination of mans Free Will to the actual election of good or evil; hath bin the rock, againſt which many the greateſt wits of all Ages and Religions have bin ſhipwrackt, in their perſwaſions of the irreſiſtible en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement of Deſtiny.</p>
                  <p>To extricate our judgements out of this maze, let us remember and adhaere unto that excellent Axiome of the moſt and moſt learned of the School-men; <hi>Praeviſionem Dei nihil influere i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

both the one and the other. For, in truth, God cannot foreknow the future actions of man, or the effects of remedies adminiſtred, otherwiſe then becauſe of their neceſſary Futurity. Since, if we take a way the <hi>Futurition</hi> of events, we neceſſarily deſtroy the <hi>Prenotion</hi> of God.</p>

the <hi>Certainty</hi> of <hi>Gods Praeſcience:</hi> ſince that determineth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but only praeſuppoſeth all things; nor doth God, by a decree ſubſequent to that Preſcience, praeordain that this or that individual man ſhall recover of ſuch or ſuch a diſeaſe, unleſs by virtue of ſuch or ſuch appropriate remedies, which the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician ſhall in the opportunity praeſcribe.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it a more juſtifiable plea at the bar of reaſon, to argue thus; if the Term of mans life be certainly and preciſely fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to God, then muſt it, together with the order and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of its Futurition, be ſixt and immutable: then to argue thus; if God hath a certain and preciſe cognition of any thing <hi>already paſt,</hi> as of the Creation of the world; therefore could that thing have come to paſs no otherwiſe, nor at any other time, then it did; therefore was the world created by God, <hi>non libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ré ſed neceſſariò,</hi> not by an <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> but <hi>Neceſſary</hi> and reſtrained activity. For, as <hi>Science,</hi> having for its <hi>object</hi> a thing <hi>Praeterite,</hi> doth infer no neceſſity upon that thing praeterite, that it ſhould have bin ſo and no otherwiſe effected: ſo doth <hi>Praeſcience,</hi> having for its object a thing <hi>Future,</hi> infer no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity upon its futurition; each being an <hi>Immanent Action</hi> in God, <hi>&amp; extra rem,</hi> or having no compulſive influence at all upon that particular thing, or its Cauſes: and <hi>Futurum eſſe</hi> imports no other thing, but an <hi>object</hi> of <hi>Praeſcience;</hi> nor <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritum eſſe,</hi> any thing but an <hi>object</hi> of <hi>Science,</hi> or <hi>Memorie.

                  <p>But wholly Antarctical to this, is that <hi>Praeſcience</hi> which is grounded upon <hi>Divine Praedeſtination,</hi> whereby not only the Term of every individuals life, together with the whole order and manner of its Futurition, is praefixt; but alſo all thoſe Cauſes, whoſe <hi>refractary</hi> or <hi>counter-activity</hi> might in any reſpect hinder the preciſe accompletion of that prefixt Term, are prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented or praedetermined to invalidity, leſt the Praeſcience become uncertain or dubious: whether that <hi>Praedetermination</hi> diſpoſe <hi>per modum Cauſae Efficientis,</hi> by a certain <hi>Phyſical</hi> and really

                  <p>The <hi>firſt Decree</hi> of God runs thus; I will, that <hi>Peter</hi> live till the expiration of the natural or temperamental leaſe of his life; conceive it to be till his glaſs hath run 50. 60. 70. or 80. year: but that <hi>John</hi> wither before hee's ripe, and fall in the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:49051:150"/>
June of his age; conceive it to be in the 20. 30. or 40. year from his birth.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second</hi> thus; I will praeſerve <hi>Peter</hi> from this or that ſickneſs, defend him from this or that knock of misfortune, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him in, or reſtore him from this or that dangerous diſeaſe; leſt he expire before the praeſtitute Term of his life: but for <hi>John,</hi> he ſhall be invaded by ſuch or ſuch a mortal diſeaſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch or ſuch a wound incurable, or periſh by this or that fatal Accident; ſo that he may verify my prognoſtick in dying at the hour appointed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Third</hi> thus; leſt <hi>Peter</hi> laps into ſuch or ſuch a mortal diſeaſe, I will that he be provided of an induſtrious and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Phyſician to preſcribe unto him rational, generous, and effectual prophylactical means; or, if ſurpriſed therewith, that he uſe convenient and victorious therapeutical medicaments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in order to the expulſion of the ſame; that ſo the number of his days be not ſhortned: but, on the contrary, that <hi>John</hi> ſhall fall into ſuch or ſuch a dangerous ſickneſs, and want Phyſicians, medicaments, and all other Conſervatives whatever; leſt he ſurvive beyond the moment praefixt.</p>

On the contrary, that <hi>John</hi> may not, by the right uſe of that Elective Liberty conferred upon his Will, and by a deſire of attaining to longaevity, endevour the conſervation of his health, by diaetetical or pharmaceutical obſervations; I will, that he want that ingenuity, that prudence, that advice, and thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts, conducible to the prolongation of his life, and finally that aſſiſtance of <hi>Divine Grace,</hi> without which it is not only probable, but neceſſary, that he ſhould reſign up the rains of his Will to Senſuality, and ſo either by the prodigal effuſion of his

                  <p>Or, in a higher key of Fatality, thus; though <hi>Peter,</hi> by the abuſe of his Will, raſhly expoſe himſelf to the fury of the moſt dangerous Enemies to life, and by gluttony, ebrioſity, vindictive anger, ſalacity, &amp;c. render himſelf both unfit, and unworthy longer to inſpire the common aer; I will notwithſtanding all this again repaire the breaches of his conſtitution, protect him from the malice of danger, and conſerve him till the moment predeſtined, nor ſhall he be taken off by any other means, but what my Will hath predetermined.

                  <p>The <hi>Third</hi> and laſt <hi>Abſurdity</hi> imports no leſs then the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion <note place="margin">Article 9.

The Eſſence of mans Liberty Elective, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent primarily in the <hi>Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency</hi> of the <hi>Intellect;</hi> and in the <hi>Will</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dependently.</note> is affirmed to poſſeſs a <hi>Free-Will,</hi> for this reaſon; that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many divers objects occurring to, and falling under the deliberation of the <hi>Cognoſcent Faculty,</hi> or <hi>Intellect,</hi> he is not obliged to make his election of any one more then the others, nor doth he ſo elect any one, as that it doth not ſtill remain in his power to refuſe that again and elect the contrary. <hi>This Liberty</hi> of election ſome men have founded only in the <hi>Will,</hi> and others in the <hi>Rational Faculty;</hi> to whoſe opinion reaſon adviſeth us to adhaere. For doubtleſs the <hi>Will,</hi> conſidered <hi>per ſe</hi> is a blind and undiſcerning <hi>Faculty,</hi> or <hi>Power,</hi> which can make no progreſs, nor find the way towards convenient objects without the manuduction of the <hi>Intellect,</hi> which as it were lights the torch unto, and as a knowing guide conducts the Will: ſo that ſince it is the proper office of the Intellect to informe and conduct the Will, and the proper office of the Will to follow the direction and guidance of the Intellect; it is not only mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that the Will cannot deflect from the right way, towards the amplectence and fruition of Good, unleſs by the miſtaking Intellect it be ſeduced into the devious paths of Evil; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that the <hi>Liberty</hi> of election is conſiſtent in the <hi>Intellect primarily,</hi> and in the <hi>Will</hi> onely at the <hi>ſecond hand,</hi> or by way of <hi>dependence.</hi> To ſpeak yet more expreſly, the nature of this Liberty Elective ſeems radically to conſiſt in that <hi>Indifferency,</hi> in reſpect whereof the Faculty called free, may or may not be carried on towards any particular object, which the School-men call the Liberty of <hi>Contradiction;</hi> or be ſo carried on towards one object, as that it may at pleaſure renege that Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and make a new one of the quite contrary, which they call the Liberty of <hi>Contrariety.</hi> Aſſuredly, ſince no man can
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:49051:158"/>
underſtand how there can be a Liberty, without a Faculty of Election; it is evident that the Election can be only there, where is the <hi>Indifferency:</hi> in regard that either where one ſingle object is propoſed, or the faculty reſtrained and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the election and proſecution of any one ſingle object: there can be no free election, ſince election praeſuppoſeth a varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of objects, and is nothing but the praeferring one to all the reſt, or, if there be but two, the choyce of one and the refuſal of the other.</p>
                  <p>Some there have bin, and thoſe no mean <hi>Clerks,</hi> who have <note place="margin">Article 2. An egregious Error of ſome Divines, that the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the Will doth conſummate ly conſiſt in its immoveable <hi>Fixation</hi> on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Good.</note> affirmed the Will to be then moſt free, when it is ſo determined to, and fixt upon one object grant it to be the <hi>Summum bonum</hi> or chiefeſt Good, that it cannot be deflected to its contrary Evil; and the reaſon they give is this; that ſince the Dilection, proſecution and fruition of that Good is highly <hi>Voluntary,</hi> it ought therefore to be accounted highly <hi>free.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we have juſt ground to doubt, that the Authors of this <note place="margin">Article 3. Their inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of the real Difference between a <hi>Spontaneous,</hi> &amp; <hi>Arbitrary</hi> acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Error.</note> Paradox did not either clearly underſtand, or at leaſt ſufficiently conſider tho real difference betwixt a <hi>Spontaneous</hi> and an <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> action; while they contended that becauſe either may be ſaid to be Voluntary, therfore they are one and the ſame originally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For indeed a Spontaneous action, though when men diſcourſe at randome and in the general, it may ſeem to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend an Arbitrary one, yet in praeciſe and diſtinct reaſoning, it ſounds no more then a certain blind impulſe of nature groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon no praecedent ratiocination; when an Arbitrary action properly ſo called, depends upon a praevious ratiocination, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, dijudication, and election.</p>
                  <p>That a Spontaneous action is no more then an indiſcreet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe <note place="margin">Article 4. That a <hi>Sponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous</hi> action, and an indeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate <hi>Impulſe</hi> of Nature, are homologous or identical.</note> of nature, devoid of all deliberation, is manifeſt from hence; that not onely Infants and Brutes (to neither of which a Philoſopher will allow either uſe of Reaſon, or Liberty of Will) may do many things ſpontaneouſly, but even Inanimates have their Spontaneous motions, as Fire aſcends ſpontaneouſly, and
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:49051:158"/>
all bodies endowed with gravity deſcend ſpontaneouſly: ſo that in truth, to act by the impulſe of nature, and to act ſpontaneouſly appear to be one and the ſame thing diverſly phraſed. And this makes it the leſs wonder, if ſince every appetite be <hi>ex ſuâ naturâ</hi> by the tendency of its own nature, carried on towards Good, it may be ſaid to be carried on towards Good of its own accord or ſpontaneouſly; and ſo indeed that as a ſtone becauſe by naturall tendency it falls downward, cannot again change that tendency and aſcend upward, ſo likewiſe the Appetite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is determined only to Good, wants an Indifferency of tending towards Evil: and as a ſtone by reaſon of its want of Indifferency to upward and downward, is ſaid to be moved downward Spontaneouſly, but not Arbitrarily, ſo the Appetite by reaſon of its defect of Indifferency to Good and Evil may be ſaid to tend towards Good in general Spontaneouſly, but not Arbitrarily. And hence comes it, that if you pleaſe to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Will to be determined to any one particular Good, grant it to be the <hi>Summum Bonum,</hi> ſo that it cannot relinquiſh that, and with aequal appetition proſecute any other Good, real, or only apparent, then indeed you may juſtly enough affirm the Will to tend towards that <hi>Summum Bonum ſpontaneouſly,</hi> ſince 'tis moſt natural to the Will to proſecute that which is the chiefeſt of Goods (for it would not proſecute the ſame above all others, if it were dimoved to the proſecution of leſs Good) but not <hi>Arbitrarily,</hi> ſince it wants an Indifferency of tending to another Good as well as that, or to ſpeak more plainly, ſince it is not in its power at pleaſure to deſert that chiefeſt Good, and addreſs it ſelf to the purſuit of a leſs Good.</p>
                  <p>Nor can this truth be ſtaggered by that objection, that this <note place="margin">Article 5. The Divines objection, that the Tendency of the Will is <hi>Volent,</hi> and therefore <hi>Free;</hi> praevented, by a diſtinction of <hi>Libency</hi> and <hi>Liberty.</hi>
                     </note> tendency of the Will is <hi>Volent,</hi> ſince that <hi>Volency</hi> (I ask leave to uſe that word untill I can find another more adaequate to my notion) imports not a Liberty but a meer <hi>Libency,</hi> that is a Complacency, or Collubeſcence, and ſo an excluſion of all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, violence, renitence, or impoſition: and from hence that the Dilection, Proſecution, and Fruition of ſuch a Good may be properly enough accounted Voluntary; no man can
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:49051:159"/>
rightly inferre that tis therefore highly <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> but only that tis highly <hi>Libent</hi> or Complacent; for there may be a <hi>Libency</hi> we confeſs, and yet no <hi>Liberty,</hi> becauſe no <hi>Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, whereas they have added, that the <hi>Perfection</hi> of the Liberty of the Will doth conſiſt in this, <hi>ſo to adhaere to Good as not to be capable of dimotion or diverſion from it;</hi> we may not <note place="margin">Article 6.

                     </note> unjuſtly ſuſpect them of inadvertency in that they did not diſcover this Perfection which they ſo much magnify to be not of the Liberty it ſelfe, but of the <hi>Will</hi> or <hi>Appetite,</hi> which being <hi>Imperfect</hi> only in this reſpect, that at pleaſure it may deſert and abandon real and true Good, and convert to the Affectation and proſecution of ſpecious and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit; muſt acquire its <hi>perfection</hi> from hence, that quitting that native Indifferency or Liberty, it ſo firmely and inſeparably adhaere to real and true Good, that nothing can divorce it from thence and alienate it to the proſecution of counterfeit. Beſides, we conceive ſuch a perfection of the Will to be above the ſober hopes of mortality, as being reſerved to make no ſmall part of the Souls Beatitude in her ſtate of Glorification, when ſhe ſhall have no other object but the real <hi>Summum Bonum,</hi> and no other Appetite but a fixt dilection thereof. For, had fleſh and blood bin capable of ſo great and divine an Excellency, as the deveſting the Will of that Indifferency to Good and Evil, and the conſtant determination of it only to real Good; doubtleſs <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul,</hi> a man of the moſt mortified affections to the ſpecious Goods of this life, and of the moſt fervent deſires towards the ſubſtantial and eternal of the next, had never with ſo many tears lamented his being ſubject to that inevitable and implacable <hi>Pſychomachy</hi> and civil war betwixt his Rational and Senſual Appetites, nor in the height of deſpaire to conquer thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious inclinations to evil, cried out, <gap reason="foreign">

But this miſtake hath proved of no ſmall advantage to the <note place="margin">Article 7. What kind of <hi>Indifferency</hi> that is, wherein the Liberty Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive is e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

In our praecedent lines we affirmed, that the <hi>Intellect</hi> is guide, and doth hold the torch, or give light to the Will; and manifeſt it is that this <hi>Light</hi> which the Intellect holds forth to the Will, is no other but that <hi>Judgement,</hi> which the Intellect delivers concerning the Good and evil of objects, <hi>i. e.</hi> that this object is good, and that evil; or among ſeveral different goods, that this is more, and that leſs good: ſo that when the Will is ſaid to be averted from one object and converted to another, that mutation proceeds from hence, that the Judgement of the Intellect is now for one thing and anon for another, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlexion of the Will is dependent on the inflexion of the Intellect. Since, therefore, the <hi>Flexility</hi> of the Will is ſubſequent and conform to the Flexility of the Intellect, which conſiſts in the mutability of its Judgements: we are upon that conſideration to obſerve, that the Intellect makes uſe of certain <hi>Notions,</hi> or as common Phyſiology calls them, <hi>Simple Apprehenſions</hi> of things, in order to its own information, and ſucceeding pronunciation of Judgement concerning their natures. For neceſſary it is, that the Mind have a <hi>Praenotion</hi> what the Sun is and what <hi>Light</hi> is, that ſo it may judge afterwards that Light is in the Sun, or that the Sun is a Lucid Body; as alſo what Hony and what Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is, that it may afterwards pronounce Hony to be Sweet. But in reſpect that in objects which fall under <hi>Speculation,</hi> the Intellect doth acquieſce in ſuch a ſimple Judgement, nor can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre anything further by neceſſity of conſequence: therefore in objects reducible to <hi>action,</hi> it hath a certain compound Notion
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:49051:160"/>
called a <hi>Propoſition</hi> or <hi>Enunciation,</hi> which by reaſon of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther common Notion congenial and implantate in the mind of every Man from its firſt exiſtence, is immediately annexed to the former ſimple notion, and ſuperadded thereunto as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, which is really that which we call <hi>Judicium Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> Practical Judgement. For inſtance, the Intellect having judged that the Sun is a Lucid Body, may therein acquieſce and proceed to no further inference; but ſo ſoon as it judgeth hony to be ſweet, becauſe it holds as implantate a ſecond complex no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that what is ſweet is to be taſted, therefore it inſtantly pronounceth this concluſion, that Hony is to be taſted. And becauſe practicable objects are not <hi>Vniverſals,</hi> but <hi>Singulars;</hi> and for inſtance, the Intellect doth not give judgement concerning Hony in general, but of this objected Hony that it is ſweet; therefore to this judgement, this Hony is ſweet, inſtantly coheres and is ſuperadded that ſecond judgement, this Hony is to be taſted. Nor that only, but ſuch is the nature of this judgement, that without any delay, if nothing countermand, ſucceeds the <hi>Execution</hi> thereof, as in this caſe the actual Deguſtation of Hony. And upon the conſideration of the immediate ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the Execution upon a practical judgement, was it that <hi>Ariſtotle (de Animalium motu cap.</hi> 7.) would allow no diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between an <hi>Action</hi> and a <hi>Concluſion,</hi> for ſaith he, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion which follows upon two propoſitions, is the very action it ſelf:</hi> which he moſt conveniently illuſtrateth by ſeveral <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,</hi> the praeſent omiſſion whereof we hope either the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or lecture of our competent Reader will ſupply. And this <note place="margin">Article 8. That to every <hi>Judgement</hi> of the <hi>Intellect,</hi> is immediately and neceſſarily conjoyned an <hi>Appetition</hi> or <hi>Averſation</hi> of the <hi>Will;</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective to the Good, or Evil nunciated.</note> juſtifies their knowledge, who firſt denominated ſuch a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which is the Action it ſelf (or to which at leaſt the Execution doth individually cohaere) a <hi>Practical Judgement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are moreover to obſerve, that ſince the action or Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Judgement cannot ſucceed, unleſs the function of the <hi>Appetite</hi> or <hi>Will</hi> intervene between the Judgement and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; therefore muſt every Judgement or Notion of Good have adjoyned unto it an <hi>Appetition</hi> of that Good, as every Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:49051:160"/>
of Evil hath adjoyned unto it an <hi>Averſion</hi> from that Evil: ſo that the Intellect cannot pronounce this judgement, that what is ſweet is to be taſted, but inſtantly riſeth up the <hi>Appetite</hi> and wills the taſting of the Sweet; nor (to deſcend to ſingulars) enunciate this ſweet is to be taſted, but immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately the Will is on edge to taſt this Sweet. And hence it comes, that no concluſion can be extracted, nor Execution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſucceed; but onely becauſe together with the Judgement the function of the Appetite hath praeceded. For the reaſon why the Concluſion of a <hi>Practical</hi> Syllogiſme hath always the Execution or action coherent to it, but the Concluſion of a <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative</hi> hath not; is no other then this, that the function of the Will or Appetite is always aſſociated to the praemiſes or judgements of the Intellect in one, and not in the other. And therefore ſo often as the Intellect gives Judgement of Good; which is the proper object of the Will; as often is the Will excited ſo neceſſarily, that its function or deſire of fruition fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows upon the heeles of the Judgement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as cloſely as a ſhadow attends a body in Sunſhine; ſo that if the Intellect judge any thing to be good, the Will immediately deſires that good; as on the contrary, if the Intellect judge any thing to be evil, the Will immediately abhors that evil.</p>
                  <p>This is an excellent Axiome, <hi>that one truth can never be clearely underſtood, but it leads on to the diſcovery of another;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Article 9. The <hi>Inſtability</hi> of the Will, in its <hi>Appetitions;</hi> neceſſarily cauſed by the <hi>Inſtability</hi> of the Intellect, in its <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                     </note> and here we have experience of it: for from the praemiſes it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults a perſpicuous verity, that becauſe the Intellect is for the moſt part fickle and inconſtant in its <hi>judgements;</hi> therefore muſt the Will be as wavering and unſtable in its <hi>Appetitions:</hi> and when the Intellect to day judges any object to be good, but to morrow judges it to be evil; then doth this Paedantique faculty the Will affect that object to day, and hate it again to morrow: and when the Intellect to day declares that ſuch an object is to be affected and proſecuted becauſe 'tis good, but to morrow faceth about to a ſecond object, and apprehending it to be better then the firſt, judges that to be proſecuted rather of the two; then is the Will to day carried on to the firſt object, and to morrow
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:49051:161"/>
averted from it to the Second. In a word, the <hi>Proſecution</hi> and <hi>Averſion</hi> of the Will is dependent on, and conforme to thoſe Notions and Judgements which the Intellect delivers concerning the more or leſs good, or good and evil of objects.</p>
                  <p>Further, in reſpect that amonſt good objects, one is <hi>really and truly good,</hi> another only <hi>apparent and counterfeit;</hi> and likewiſe <note place="margin">Article 10. The <hi>Deluſion</hi> of the Intellect, in its <hi>Judgements;</hi> neceſſitateth the <hi>Deluſion</hi> of the Will in its dependent <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions.</hi>
                     </note> among evil objects (for too frequently good is diſguiſed under the uncomely vizard of evil, and evil again guilded over with the ſpecious and alluring hatchment of Good, and then what is realy good ſeems either to be abſolute evil, or a leſs good compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and what is really evil ſeems either to be abſolute good, or a leſs evil comparatively) hence comes it we ſay, that as the Intellect is frequently <hi>deluded</hi> in its <hi>judgements,</hi> as being invited by the <hi>Apparence</hi> of Good, it judgeth a guilded evil to be a real good, or offended at the Apparence of evil, judgeth that diſguiſed good to be a real evil; ſo muſt the Will of neceſſity be <hi>deluded</hi> in its dependent <hi>Appetitions,</hi> and proſecuting an apparent good, obtain a real evil, and avoyding a ſeeming evil, be fruſtrated of a real good; or certainly as the Intellect enun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates a leſs good to be a greater, or a leſs evil to be a greater; ſo muſt the Will, proſecuting a greater good, obtain a leſs, and avoyding a leſs evil, fall upon a greater.</p>
                  <p>On the demonſtration of this grand-father Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Will is but the <hi>Needle,</hi> and the Intellect the <hi>Magnet,</hi> by <note place="margin">Article 11. That the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency</hi> of the Will, is but the ſhadow, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative of that Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency in the Intellect: and the <hi>Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of this, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitates the Determination of that.</note> whoſe verticity it is impregnated with an affectation of lying parallel to the point of good, real or apparent, (for evil as evil, <hi>i. e.</hi> preſented naked and without diſguiſe, is not the proper object of either) or, more conſimilar, that the Will is the <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> and the Intellect the <hi>Compaſs</hi> by which he ſteeres; depends alſo the diſcovery of another Abſtruſity, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency</hi> found in the Will is but the <hi>Counterfeit</hi> or <hi>Repreſentative</hi> of that Indifferency which is congenial to the Intellect, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, that the <hi>determination</hi> of that Indifferency in the <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> cauſeth the determination of the like Indifferency in the <hi>Handmayd,</hi> to this or that particular object. Now the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:49051:161"/>
Indifferency of the Intellect ſeems eſſentially to conſiſt in this, that it is not ſo adliged to adhaerence, to its own judgement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the good of any thing objected, as that it may not alter its judgement, and if the apparence of good ſeems greater in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther object, apoſtate from the firſt, and as vigorouſly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently convert to the ſecond. For the Intellect is not of the Number of thoſe faculties, which by theſe fundamental conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Eſſence are determined only to <hi>one</hi> certain motion, as Gravity in bodies devoid of animation, the Generative virtue in Animals, &amp;c. but is by nature ſo <hi>Flexile,</hi> that having truth or good for its object, it may one while judge this and another while that, and perhaps the quite contrary of one and the ſame, and now affect an object under the notion of true and good, and within an houre, nay poſſibly in a moment, revoke that judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and again diſlike it under the notion of falſe or evil, or at leaſt, of leſs true, or leſs good.</p>
                  <p>This conſtant Inconſtancy of the Intellect, the moſt happy Wit of <hi>Cicero</hi> deſcanting upon, moſt conveniently compares it <note place="margin">Article 12.

                     </note> Intellect ſhould thither convert, and there fix, where is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt <hi>ſemblance</hi> of <hi>good:</hi> and therefore its native <hi>Indifferency</hi> is not ſuch, as that abandoning an object, whoſe good is more perſpicuous, it can affect another, whoſe good is leſs perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; or, rejecting a judgement which appeares more true, court and embrace another which appeares leſs true: becauſe, as the beam of a balance, being depreſſed on one extreme by a greater weight impoſed, is never elevated by the impoſition of a leſs weight on the contrary extreme, but of a greater; ſo likewiſe can it not be, that that aſſent of the Intellect, which is cauſed by the perſpicuity of Experience, or ſome praevalent reaſon, ſhould be removed to another object, unleſs by the attraction of an Experience of greater moment, or a reaſon whoſe validity and importance is more perſpicuous. And, for the eviction of this natural conformity of the Intellect to the attraction of the more ponderous Veriſimility of its objects, we need no other argument but this; that many times we find our minds aequilibrated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two judgements, or wavering in ſuſpence between two ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects equally attractive; which <hi>Fluctuation</hi> or Doubting ariſeth of neceſſity from hence, that the moments of verity, or weights of reaſon are equal on either ſide, and ſo exactly counterpoiſe each other, that the mind can acquieſce in the election of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <note place="margin">Article 14. That the <hi>Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> of the Intellect to one or two objects, is cauſed either by the more ponderous Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity therein, or the minds greater <hi>Attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon apparent on that ſide, then to thoſe on the other.</note> as a paire of ſcales charged with two equal weights can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſwayd from an aequilibrium.</p>
                  <p>Again, that it ſeems during this Fluctuation, one while to incline to the one part, and inſtantly to be counter-inclined to the other, and then again to revert to the former, and ſo to be agitated by the inquietude of ſuſpence; hath no other reaſon but this, that one while it is more <hi>attentive</hi> to the perpenſion of reaſon in the firſt object, and anon more Attentive to that in the ſecond; and ſo long doth it remain inclined to the invite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the one, as it apprehends the good thereof more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent then of the other, and no longer; after the ſame manner as if when a paire of ſcales are aequilibrated by two aequal weights,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:49051:162"/>
you ſhall ſuperadd to either end of the balance but a few grains more, that end muſt be depreſſed, and upon the ſhifting of thoſe grains to the other end the former again elevated. So that when the Intellect doth at laſt deflect to one part, this <hi>Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> muſt proceed from hence; that either the Apparence of verity is ſomewhat more ponderous on that part, or at leaſt that the more conſtant <hi>Attention</hi> to the Veriſimility of that part, conjoyned to the minds <hi>impatience,</hi> (which too frequently helps to turn the Scales, and therefore ought to be allowed for) ſupplying the defect of weight, makes it ſeem ſo.</p>

For in him who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits a vicious Act, there always is excited ſome <hi>Paſſion,</hi> either of Pleaſure, or Anger, or Ambition, or Avarice, which raiſeth a tempeſt in his mind, and ſo perturbeth, perverteth, and drowneth that habitual Science; inſomuch, that what ever of good is in virtue, and what ever of evil is in vice, becomes thereby obnubilated, and darkened; and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, whatever of difficulty ſeems to be in virtue, and what ever of pleaſantneſs in vice, becomes thereby more conſpicuous and illuſtrated: <hi>i. e. Paſſion</hi> is a Perſpective, which repreſenteth as well the difficulty of virtue, as the complacence of vice, in magnified dimenſions; and on the contrary diminiſheth the good of the one, and the evil of the other. And hence comes it, that the real good of virtue attracteth the mind more weakly, and the ſeeming Good of vice more ſtrongly; and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the real evil of vice averteth or diſguſteth the mind more weakly, and the ſeeming evil of good more ſtrongly. So he that offends, may, we confeſs, with <hi>Ovid,</hi> ſay, <hi>Video meliora, probóque, deteriora ſequor,</hi> that he knows thoſe things which he rejecteth to be the better, and thoſe things which he ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth to be the worſe; but yet, this muſt be referred unto ſome other time, when he recognizes his habitual Science, and calls to mind, that once he had other judgements of thoſe things: for he cannot juſtly ſay ſo of that time wherein he offended, ſince then he judged thoſe things he purſued to be the better, and thoſe he deſerted to be the worſe.</p>
                  <p>Now as for that internal <hi>regret, contriſtation,</hi> and poenitence, which invades the mind of every Delinquent immediately after,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:49051:166"/>
and moſt frequently in the ſame moment of the perpetration of his offence; this proceeds from his animadverſion that he ſuffers ſome <hi>loſs of good.</hi> But ſince this his apprehenſion of the loſs of good, and that reluctancy of mind attendant thereupon is but dull and weak, in compariſon of that complacency he is affected withall by the ſeeming good or pleaſure of evil, which ſubdues his judgement to an approbation of it: hence it is manifeſt, that he conſiders and perpends the impendent omiſſion of Good, and the incurſion of evil, not <hi>ſeriouſly</hi> and <hi>profoundly</hi> as he ought, but only <hi>perfunctorily</hi> and <hi>ſlightly.</hi> For, were the puniſhment, ſorrow, ignominy, and other evils, which he only lightly and confuſedly apprehends, and fears, profoundly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and lookt into by him, not as abſent, not as future, not as uncertain, and avoidable, but as impendent, preſent, certain, and inevitable; without all doubt the ſmalleſt glimpſe of reaſon would be ſufficient to let him ſee thoſe forcible determents, nor could he be ſo mad as from the rock of knowledge to precipitate himſelf into the moſt horrid gulph of vice. And therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit an offender may ſay that he ſaw and approved the Good, but embraced the Evil, yet is that <hi>Inconſideration</hi> or <hi>Non-adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,</hi> by reaſon whereof he doth not ſufficiently diſcover all the qualities and circumſtances of the evil object, and what and how great miſchiefs muſt neceſſarily enſue upon his actual proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, a kind of Ignorance.

                  <p>To underſtand the nature of this <hi>Non-excuſing Ignorance</hi> the more diſtinctly, let us obſerve, that every Delinquent muſt in juſtice charge the Ignorance he praetends, upon one of theſe two Cauſes; either <hi>that himſelf was to himſelf the cauſe of his ignorance:</hi> or <hi>that he neglected the means and advantages of acquiring knowledge, i. e.</hi> that he did not imploy his <hi>Cognoſcent Faculty</hi> on the examination and conſideration of the real good or evil of his action, with that care, ſeriouſneſs, and ſedulity, which was requiſite.</p>
                  <p>To the <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe Cauſes belongs the ignorance of a <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard;</hi> for in being the Cauſe of his <hi>Ebriety,</hi> he is alſo the Cauſe of his <hi>Ignorance;</hi> and 'twas in his power to have praevented <hi>this,</hi> by the praecaution of <hi>that:</hi> and therefore his Ignorance is ſo far ſhort of extenuating, that it naturally aggravates his culpability; and he, if <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> may be judge, deſerves a double puniſhment, one for making himſelf drunk, another for the crime committed in his Drunkenneſs. Hither alſo we are to refer his Ignorance, who reſiſteth not the force of a <hi>Paſſion</hi> or perturbation of his mind in the firſt motion or beginning thereof,

while 'tis yet but weak, and to be ſuppreſt by a ſmall oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of reaſon; but permits it to acquire more violence, and gain upon him by degrees, till its impulſe grow impetuous, and more inoppugnable: as alſo his, who ſuffers a vicious <hi>Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which he might without any conſiderable difficulty have at firſt refracted and totally extinguiſhed, to grow into a ſetled <hi>Habit,</hi> which pleading praeſcription and poſſeſſion, is hardly ejected, but plays the obſolute Tyrant ore the mind, and holds the Scepter of both Underſtanding and Will by the ineluctable title of Conqueſt. Thus if a man, who having a rare Bird in his hand, willingly lets it ſly, ſhould complain that he cannot recover it again; tis not to be expected that any rational per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould pity him for his loſs, but rather deride his folly, in that he manumitted it when twas in his power to have kept it: and if a man contract ſome dangerous diſeaſe by intemperance, who can afford him half ſo much compaſſion, ſince twas in his power not to have bin intemperate, as if he had bin invaded by ſome impartial Epidemick Contagion, againſt which none the greateſt temperance is an infallible praeſervative?

Which that we may the more worthily performe, let us, with <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> concede two diſtinct ſpecies of Anger, (1) one cauſed in a moment, which invading with ſome violence, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be concealed; but diſcovers it ſelf for the moſt part by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring the face with a Vermilion, or Aurora tincture on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain; but performes little, and is eaſily and ſoon calmed. (2) Another, which invading with leſs violence, is not to be diſcovered, unleſs rarely by inducing paleneſs upon the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, by any ſignes in the beginning; but being of a leſs diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive condition, doth more corrode and gall the heart, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently produce more dangerous effects. To the firſt of theſe, they are moſt obnoxious, who have the moſt of Love, Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or ſweetneſs of diſpoſition habited in them. For it ariſeth not from any profound <hi>hatred,</hi> but from a ſuddain <hi>Averſation,</hi> repentinely ſurpriſing the Mind: and becauſe loving, good, and Heroick minds are always propenſe to imagine, that all things ought to proceed in that manner or courſe which they judge to be the beſt, therefore ſo ſoon as they diſcover any thing to be carried on in a contrary courſe to Good, they inſtantly make a ſtand in their thoughts, become offended at it, and grow angry; yea many times when the matter concerns not them in ſpecial; for ſince they love much, they take to heart, (as the vulgar phraſe it) reſent, and appropriate the Cauſe of them they love, as neerly as if it were their own, inſomuch as what would have bin no more then matter of <hi>Indignation</hi> to others, proves matter of <hi>Anger</hi> to them. And becauſe that Inclination, whereby they become poſſeſt with a conſtant propenſity to love, doth effect, that they have always much of heat, becauſe much of blood in and about their Heart; therefore that repentine Averſion, which ſuddainly ſurpriſeth them, cannot but propell ſome ſmall quantity of Choler (the Tinder whereon the ſparks of this Paſſion fix and foment) to the Heart; nor that little of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:49051:168"/>
Choler but be accended, and excite, in an inſtant, a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, and efferveſcence of the blood thither propelled. But this Commotion laſteth but a ſmall ſpace of time, becauſe the impulſe or force of the unexpected Averſation is of no continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and ſo ſoon as they deprehend the matter for which they were angry, to be of no moment, and ſuch as ought not to have commoved them to that height; they becalme themſelves, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure down their ſpirits, and become affected with a reluctancy againſt and a poenitence for that Paſſion, and ſo deſtroy it in the Embryo or ſhell. With the <hi>other,</hi> weak, abject, and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous minds are moſt tranſported. For though it ſeldome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it ſelf in the beginning, unleſs by ſome paleneſs in the face; yet is its force by degrees increaſed by reaſon of that agitation which the fervent deſire of Revenge exciteth in the blood, which being permixed with that Choler propelled to the heart from the inferior part of the Liver and Spleen, kindles therein a ſharp, pungent, and corroding Heat. And as thoſe minds are moſt generous, and noble, which are moſt inclined to <hi>Gratitude;</hi> ſo are thoſe the moſt proud, abject and baſe, which ſuffer themſelves the moſt to be tranſported with this kind of ignoble <hi>Anger.</hi> For by ſo much the greater do Injuries appear to be, by how much the greater value Pride makes a man put upon himſelf, and by how much the greater aeſtimation is ſet upon thoſe Goods which are taken away by that Injury: and by ſo much a higher rate are thoſe goods prized at, by how much the more weak, abject, and ignoble the mind of him is that aeſtimates them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in truth they are dependent upon others pleaſure; nor doth a well ordered mind loſe any part of its happineſs by being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of them. Now, having duly praeconſidered all things occurrent in this pregnant example, we may not only without difficulty underſtand what thoſe <hi>firſt motions</hi> or <hi>incitements</hi> are, which objects exciting in the mind thereby obtrude themſelves upon the Intellect, or rather compell the Intellect to apprehend them under that ſpecies in which they praeſent themſelves; but alſo that, though thoſe motions are not in our power, yet the <hi>Conſequents</hi> or <hi>Actions</hi> to which they provoke us, are ſubject to our <hi>Deliberation,</hi> Examination, and Arbitrary <hi>Election,</hi> or

                  <p>To conclude, we are ready to confeſs, that among thoſe many excuſes, which the Sophiſtry of the Advocates of vice hath <note place="margin">Article 8. <hi>Neceſsity,</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> conceded to be, in ſome meaſure, Excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: and what are the <hi>objects</hi> of Excuſing Fear.</note> alledged for the extenuation of its Culpability, the moſt weighty and conſiderable is the violence of <hi>Neceſsity</hi> and <hi>Fear.</hi> But, all <hi>violence</hi> muſt proceed from an <hi>external</hi> Principle, and is not admitted without ſome <hi>Renitency</hi> in the thing that ſuffers it; and that <hi>Neceſsity,</hi> whereby any man is coacted, muſt proceed from an <hi>external</hi> and <hi>preſent</hi> Cauſe; and <hi>fear</hi> is an internal Paſſion, though excited by an external Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Evill; and differeth from <hi>Cupidity</hi> in this, that this, though it be excited by an external cauſe alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> a future Good, yet

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nwillingneſs.</hi> Upon which conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was it, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> concluded him exceeding ſtupid and ridiculous, who, having vitiated his friends wife, ſhould for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe pretend, that he was conſtrained to that perfidious and immodeſt action by the violent temptation of <hi>pleaſure;</hi> bur holds him excuſable who is compelled to omit an office of friendſhip by the praevention of ſome more conſiderable incommodity impendent upon himſelf, ſince the Neceſſity of the one is more violent and urgent, then the obligation of the other. For the more eaſy deciſion of all diſputes concerning the more or leſs preſſure of theſe kinds of Neceſſity, <hi>Cicero</hi> puts this Caſe. <hi>Si conſtitueris te cuipiam advocatum in rem prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentem eſſe venturum; atque interim graviter aegrotare filius coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perit, non ſit contra officium non facere quod dixeris; magiſque ille cui promiſſum ſit, ab officio diſcedat ſi ſe deſtitutum queratur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This praemiſed, we may ſafely conclude, that a <hi>ſmall</hi> and <hi>light fear</hi> is not to be accounted ſufficient to excuſe a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; becauſe it cannot uſurp upon and countermand the Liberty of the Mind; nay nor a <hi>great and ſtrong fear</hi> (which is therefore allowed by ſome great Clerks for an excuſe, becauſe it may ſometimes invade and ſtagger a mind in other things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and generous) ſince it cannot ſo oppoſe the Liberty Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, as not to leave the mind poſſeſt with ſome <hi>Libency.</hi> And this is to be underſtood, not in reſpect to that Evil, which is ſuſtained or undergone in the praeſent, but to that far greater one, which is avoided, and in compariſon of which the leſs Evil hath indeed the reaſon of Good; becauſe it is as it were the <hi>means</hi> whereby the greater Evil is averted or prevented, as when Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants throw their treaſure overboard, for fear of drowning, and a Traveller delivers his purſe to Robbers for fear of having his throate cut. Now, how far this kind of fear, which ſeems to neceſſitate the commiſſion of a ſmall Evil for the probable prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of a greater, may be extended by way of Excuſation; as alſo of what ſorts thoſe evils muſt be which juſtify this fear; the exacteſt and profoundeſt of <hi>Moraliſts</hi> have found it no eaſy matter praeciſely to determine; chiefly becauſe according to the

variety of mens Temperaments, ages, ſexes, Educations, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits &amp;c. what is but a weak and light fear to one, may be great and potent to another; but all conſent that we are to underſtand it to be a fear of no leſs then Death, Mutilation, torment, ſervitude, long exile, taedious impriſonment, aeternal diſhonour or ignominy, privation of all, or the greateſt part of ones eſtate, or livelyhood (and in this particular, not in reſpect of a mans ſelf only, but alſo for thoſe who depend upon him for temporal ſubſiſtence, as wife, children, parents &amp;c.) as alſo that kind of fear which is a ſpecies of <hi>Reverence,</hi> and ſuch as may be in a ſubject, in reſpect of his Prince, in a child in reſpect of his Father, in a wife in reſpect of her husband &amp;c.

As for the full deſcription of her <hi>Nature,</hi> or more properly, what Kind of <hi>Activity</hi> the chiefeſt <hi>Philoſophers</hi> have allowed <note place="margin">Article 2. <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſt.</hi> their Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of fortune, examined, and illuſtrated: and 3 Concluſions inferred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</note> her, and to what order of <hi>Cauſes</hi> referred her; this we cannot ſo ſatisfactorily preſent by any other way, as by a ſhort Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration, and aequitable Collation of their ſeveral <hi>Deſinitions</hi> of her.</p>

To explain this, they <hi>exemplify</hi> in him, who digging in the earth, with no other deſigne, but to plant a tree, found a great Treaſure, of which he never thought: for (ſay they) the Invention of the Treaſure is an effect by Accident, i. e. evenient above the hopes and beſides the intention of him that digged; and ſo the Digger in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as he is <hi>Cauſa per ſe</hi> of the digging, is alſo <hi>Cauſa per accidens</hi> of the invention of the Treaſure.

               <p>However, we perceive (reflecting upon the former Example) ſince the Double Effect, viz. the digging of the earth, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the treaſure, had but one ſingle Cauſe, viz. the man that digged: that, for this reaſon, the Digger may juſtly enough be ſayd to be <hi>Cauſa per ſe,</hi> in reſpect of the one, and <hi>per accidens</hi> in reſpect of the other.

Thus if any man, who foreknowes, or at leaſt conjectures, that ſuch a Perſon will come and digg in ſuch a place, doth there hide treaſure, to the end that the other may find it: in this caſe, in reſpect to him that hid it, the Invention of the treaſure is not a Fortuitous Effect; but in reſpect to him, who unexpectedly finds it, it is.

And all the reſt of the Stoical Family, as well generally quoted by <hi>Diogenes Laertius,</hi> as <hi>Panaetius</hi> and <hi>Poſſidonius</hi> (at leaſt, if He be the true Father of that Book, <hi>de Mundo,</hi> vulgarly conſcribed to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> out of which the text is extracted) quoted by <hi>Stobae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us (Ecl.

For the <hi>Second,</hi> that <hi>Nature is its own Fate,</hi> or, more expreſly, that Nature being only a conſtitution of Cauſalities reſulting from Chance, or from a fortuitous diſpoſition and ſetlement of the Univerſal Matter, in that Figure the adſpectable World now bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth; doth neceſſitate her ſelf to the cauſation of all things: this He hath conceived inferrible from this proceſs of reaſon. Atoms (ſaith He, <hi>apud Magnenum)</hi> being the Catholique Principle, of which all things conſiſt, have an ingenite or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Motive Faculty eſſentially inhaerent; by the unceſſant activity whereof they are perpetually agitated or commoved: and all things, by coaleſcence compoſed of Atoms, cannot but conforme to the ſame motions, by which their principles are commoved. And ſithence ſome Atoms tending one way, are by the occurſe and juſtling of others diverted to another courſe; both the Diverting and Diverted from the direct line of their native tendency, cannot but obſerve, continue and purſue thoſe neceſſary motions. By the ſame reaſon, ſome bodies, compoſed of concreted Atoms, as they are praecipitated one way, by the impulſe of their own coeſſential Faculty, may, by the occurſation and arietation of others ſteering a different courſe, be deflected from the perpendicular of their motion congenial, to ſome other tranſverſe, oblique, rectilinear, &amp;c. ſo that both the Deflecting and Deflected cannot but obſerve, continue, and purſue thoſe compulſive motions. And this, in General, is that Fate, or <hi>Neceſsity,</hi> whereby <hi>Democritus</hi> would have all things effected, and by which the World was at firſt compoſed, in the ſame Figure, we ſpeculate at this day; for, as the Univerſal Principle, Atoms, concurring, crowding, rebounding reciprocally, in an infinite ſpace, by the agitation of their own inexiſtent Faculty, could not but convene, coaleſce, and cohaere into any other Forme, but what they did: ſo now having acquired that forme by Chance, can they not either change it, or not obſerve and execute thoſe motions begun, and by the mediation or interceſſion

reſponſible to what it now holds, &amp;c. For, He referred the Cauſation of all things to thoſe newly explicated congenial mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Atoms; and ſo conceived that even the <hi>Soul,</hi> or Mind of man (which He alſo fancied to be a certain <hi>Contexture of ſphaerical or orbicular Atoms)</hi> is variouſly agitated, not only by thoſe <hi>internal</hi> motions of its own inſenſible particles, which vary according to its individval Complexion <hi>(i. e.</hi> the Atoms compoſing the Soul of a Melancholy man, are of one ſort, at leaſt of one contexture; thoſe of a Cholerick, of another; thoſe of a Phlegmatick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of a third, &amp;c.) but alſo by thoſe <hi>Extradvenient</hi> motions cauſed by Objects; by whoſe <hi>Species,</hi> or Images incurrent (which Atoms alſo conſtitute) the Mind cannot but be <hi>Attracted,</hi> if they be conſentaneous and allective, or gratefull; nor not be <hi>Averted,</hi> if they be diſſentaneous and repulſive, or ingratefull. That, if the Mind be not alwaies allected by At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive Species; the reaſon is, becauſe at the ſame inſtant there occur unto it the more potent ſollicitations of their Contrary, <hi>Averting</hi> Species: and if it be not alwaies Averted by Repellent; the reaſon is equal, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant it is more ſtrongly ſollicited by their Contrary, <hi>Attractive</hi> Species. That therefore, the Mind cannot but be carried on toward Good, or that which is gratefull and allective, ſo long as it diſcovers no Evil admixt thereto: nor not be averted from Evil, or what is ingratefull and averſant, ſo long as it perceives no Good to be commixt therewith. That therefore, the Mind cannot, when two Goods are objected, but purſue the greater Good; as that which attracteth more potently: nor, when two Evils are objected, but avoyd the greater; as that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is averted more potently. That, when two objects, the one Good, the other Evil, at the ſame time praeſent their Species; it cannot but neglect the Good, ſo long as the Evil averts more potently then the Good attracts: nor not be carried towards the Good, while the Evil averts more weakly, and the Good attracts more ſtrongly. Finally, that ſince, by reaſon of the Ignorance, or Dimneſs of the Mind, it doth frequently not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Evil conſequent upon its proſecution of ſome Good; therefore is it ſubject to <hi>Deception</hi> in ſome caſes, and is often
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:49051:181"/>
carried on to that, from which it ought to have bin aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: nor perceive the Good that is conſequent upon its proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome Evil, and is therefore, as often averted from that object, to which it ought to have bin converted. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, inſomuch as all objects, by this and no other way, occur unto, and affect the Mind; ſtill it cannot but <hi>Neceſsarily</hi> be carried whither it is carried; nor but be averted from that, from which it is averted: and conſequently, that there remains to it only <hi>a Deſire of Truth, i. e.</hi> that no <hi>Counterfeit Species</hi> may occur, but that all objects may appear ſuch as in reality they are, nor Good be concealed under the diſguſting vizard of Evil, nor Evil gilded o're with the ſplendid ſemblance of Good. For this is the ſumme of what <hi>Empiricus</hi> (2. <hi>adverſ. Phyſic.)</hi> makes <hi>Democritus</hi> to have deſiderated, when He ſayd; <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:49051:181"/>
Praeſentations of Good, are aequilibrated, and reciprocally coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſe each other; the mind muſt of neceſſity be agitated by a kind of <hi>Fluctuation,</hi> and detained in the ſuſpence of <hi>Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency,</hi> or <hi>Indetermination,</hi> or <hi>Conſultation,</hi> untill it acquieſce in its <hi>Election</hi> of that Object, whoſe praeſentation of Vtility ſeems to praeponderate the others. Which, aequitably audited, amounts to no more then this; that <hi>Election</hi> is nothing but the proſecution of an Object which either really is, or at leſt ſeems more Good; and that a ſpontaneous one, without all coaction or renitency: in reſpect that man doth both ſpontaneouſly affect, and willingly proſecute Good. And that you may not admire this bold aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> that both the Occaſion and Conſultation, and free, or rather libent Election of Objects, are all links in the Chain of Fate, and ſo comprehended under this Natural Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, propugned by <hi>Democritus:</hi> the <hi>Stoicks</hi> intercept your wonder, by obtruding another as ſtrange, <hi>viz.</hi> that it depends on the ſame Concatenation of things, <hi>that you now read this our diſcourſe of Fate;</hi> as <hi>Manilius (lib.</hi> 2.) <hi>Hoc quoque fatale eſt, ſic ipſum expendere Fatum.</hi> And this, becauſe whatever Action of any man you ſhall ſuppoſe; it can be no difficulty, according to this Hypotheſis, to find out the proxime Cauſe exciting him thereunto, and to refer that Cauſe to the permotion of another remote one, and that third to the permotion of a fourth, that fourth, to the induction of a fifth, &amp;c. unravelling the ſeries of Cauſes, ſo that it muſt at length be inferred, that that ſuppoſed action could not but follow upon thoſe other actions ſubalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately praecedent, and conſequently, that it muſt be, as <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus</hi> would have it, <hi>Fatal,</hi> or <hi>Neceſsary.</hi> Which opinion <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ardently impugneth <hi>(in lib. de Interpre. cap.</hi> 8.) when diſcuſſing the verity and neceſſity of Propoſitions, He contends to evince; that though of two oppoſite ſingular propoſitions, which concern a thing either <hi>Praeterite,</hi> or <hi>Praeſent,</hi> one muſt be true, the other falſe: yet the Canon holds not in two Contrary ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular propoſitions, which concern a thing <hi>Future;</hi> the Verity of the one not neceſſitating the Falſity of the other.

Inſomuch as all things, which were to come to paſs, by reaſon of thoſe various motions of Arietation, Repuls, Declination &amp;c. by an eternal ſeries, and kind of ſubalternate Concatenation, are conſequent one upon the heels of another; and particularly that event of <hi>Cognition</hi> and <hi>Appetition,</hi> to which mans <hi>Liberty</hi> appertains; and ſo are brought to paſs by an equal <hi>Neceſsity.</hi> For, that the Mind of man may diſplay, or execute that <hi>Liberty Elective,</hi> whereby it affects and proſecutes any object, conceive it to be an <hi>Apple;</hi> neceſſary it is, that the <hi>Image</hi> or Species of that Apple be firſt emitted from it, and being tranſmitted through the mediatory organs of ſight, invade, percell, and commove the Mind to know, or apprehend it. Neceſſary to the Apple, before it can transfuſe its viſible Species to the eye, that it be put in ſome place convenient for adſpect, by him, who gathered it from the tree or received it elſewhere. Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that the Tree, which bore that apple, be firſt generated by a ſeed, and nouriſhed by the moiſture of the earth, concocted by the heat of the Sun. Neceſſary, that that Seed be derived from a former apple, and that from a former tree, planted in this or that determinate place, at this or that determinate time: and ſo by retrogreſſion to the beginning of the world, when both the Earth, and all its Vegetable ſeeds had their origination from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions and Complexions of Atoms; which could not (being agitated by the impulſe of their own inhaerent Faculty Motive) but convene and coaleſce, and acquieſce in thoſe Figures, thoſe ſituations, at that time. Again, if the <hi>Soul,</hi> or Mind be alſo a Contexture of orbicular Atoms; thoſe Atoms muſt have bin contained in the Sperm of the Parents; muſt have conſluxed thither from certain meats and drinks, as alſo from the Aer and

Becauſe from Eternity Cauſes have ſo cohaered to Cauſes, that the laſt cauſes could not but concurr; which being deduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to act, the Mind could not but know, and knowing affect, or deſire that particular object, <hi>viz.</hi> the Apple. And what is here ſaid of <hi>Cauſes,</hi> the ſame in all points is to be underſtood alſo of <hi>Atoms,</hi> which conſtitute thoſe cauſes, and from whoſe congenial motions the Cauſes derive thoſe their <hi>Motions,</hi> by which they attain to be Cauſes.</p>
                  <p>To this <hi>Exception,</hi> that we may compoſe ſome <hi>Reſponſe,</hi> ſuch <note place="margin">Article 6. The juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, by a <hi>Reſpons</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to the Phyſiology of <hi>Epicurus.</hi>
                     </note> as may ſeem Conſentaneous to the Doctrine of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and to contain ſomewhat of Probability, at leaſt; we muſt uſurp the liberty to aſſume: that ſuch is the Contexture of Atoms in the Soul, or Mind, its <hi>Declinant Atoms</hi> can break that <hi>Rigidity</hi> ariſing from other Atoms, and ſo make its nature <hi>Flexile</hi> to any part; in which <hi>Flexility,</hi> the root of <hi>Liberty</hi> doth conſiſt. And therefore, the mind, being allected by the Species of any object, is indeed carried towards that object; but ſo, that if another object ſhall inſtantly occurr, whoſe Attraction is aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, it may again be invited by, and carried towards that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject alſo: ſo that, deflecting from the firſt, it may become aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librated or indifferent to either part; which, doubtleſs, is to be Free, or Arbitrary. And that the Mind, being thus conſtituted <hi>Flexile</hi> and Indifferent, doth at length determine it ſelf rather to one then the other part; this ariſeth from hence: that the <hi>impreſsion</hi> of one <hi>Species</hi> is more violent then of the other; and conſequently that the <hi>Election</hi> ſucceeds, upon the <hi>Apprehenſion</hi> of that object, whoſe ſpecies appears either poſitively good, or comparatively more good. Finally, that the Mind, when it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecteth or willeth any object, is as it were the principal Machine, or main Spring, by whoſe motions all the Faculties, and the members deſtinate to execution are excited, and carried thither,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:49051:185"/>
whither the Mind tendeth: and this by mediation of the <hi>Spirits</hi> diſcurrent, or rather tranſmitted through all parts of the body. All which <hi>Lucretius</hi> fully expreſſeth in theſe Verſes:</p>
                  <q>

                  </q>
                  <p>Again, perhaps <hi>Epicurus</hi> will not gainſay, but that the motion of <hi>Declination</hi> is as much <hi>Natural</hi> as the motion of <hi>Gravity;</hi> But yet will He by no perſwaſions yeeld, that the Mind, being contemperate of Declinatory Atoms, is ſo affected and attracted by Neceſſity toward one object, that it cannot inſtantly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected to another. For, as a mixt Nature is made, ſo is the Mobility of its inſenſible parts varied: and from various Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral motions retuſed or refracted, ariſeth a Third Nature, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which its motions may be ſayd to be Voluntary and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural both; inſomuch as they proceed <hi>à Natura libera,</hi> from Nature free and uncoacted. Nor will He deny, ſuppoſing the Occurſation and Arietation of Atoms, that it is pure Neceſſity, that Percuſſions, Repulſes, and either Reflexions or Cohaeſions ſhould ſucceed among them: but yet may He refuſe to allow a Neceſſity of ſuch Occurſations, as if they could not be impeded, nor their Conſequents be diverted. Hence, concerning that eternal ſeries of the Cauſes of the Apple, and the Mind; <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus</hi> will grant, that when things are already effected, a kind of Neceſſity may be attributed thereunto, ſuch in reſpect whereof thoſe things cannot be uneffected; ſince, <hi>non datur jus in praeteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> there is no countermanding things Praeterite: but before thoſe things were peracted, there was no ſuch Neceſſity; ſince both Fortune, or Contingency, and the oppoſing Liberty of mans Will might have interrupted, inverted, and changed it. For few are ignorant of the wide diſparity between theſe two Aſſirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>viz.</hi> What is once done, cannot be not done: and what is done, might not have bin done. Since, in the <hi>Former,</hi> a thing is conſidered as already <hi>paſt;</hi> and in the <hi>Later,</hi> as yet <hi>to</hi>
                     <pb n="319" facs="tcp:49051:185"/>
                     <hi>come:</hi> and as according to the <hi>Former</hi> it is <hi>Neceſſary;</hi> ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Later,</hi> it, may be or <hi>Contingent,</hi> or <hi>Voluntary.</hi> By which reaſon, was it poſſible, that the <hi>Apple</hi> might not have bin praeſented to the eye; poſſible, that the Tree which bare it might firſt have withered; that the Seed, of which that tree was generated, might either have proved abortive and ſteril, or elſe have bin ſowed in ſome other place; that other of its Cauſes might have bin divers ways praepeded: which alſo may be affirmed of the Mind, and its Cauſes; and conſequently none of the many Cauſes, which did antecede the Appetition of the Apple, can be conceived to have bin Neceſſary, as they might if the Cauſes were of themſelves uncapable of Impediment, or if there were one Cauſe Paramont to all others in the Concate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which by an abſolute ſoveraignty, or deſpotique power, had directed and coacted them. Allbeit we concede, that the <hi>Appetition</hi> of the Apple by the mind, is the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of the Minds <hi>Cognition</hi> thereof, and that Cognition the conſequent of its <hi>Occurſation</hi> to the eye, and that the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of its <hi>Poſition</hi> in a place convenient for ſight, and that the conſequent of its <hi>Exiſtence,</hi> and ſo from link to link retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade up to eternity: yet notwithſtanding can no man juſtify this Inference, that therefore the <hi>Mind is Neceſsitated to that Appetition;</hi> becauſe ſtill there remains a <hi>Poſſe</hi> to the Mind of being <hi>Averted</hi> from the Affectation and Proſecution thereof, in caſe either the Species of a better object, or a ſuſpicion of poyſon therein concealed, ſhall intervene, or a refrigeration of the Stomach by the dyſpeptical and ſlatulent juice thereof be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or any other Cauſe of moment ſufficient to perſwade the mind to abſtain from the uſe thereof, ſhall be interpoſed,</p>
                  <p>Nor is this <hi>Rejoynder</hi> diſſwaſive; that, when the Mind is aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">Article 7.

                  <p>well as of thoſe, which <hi>Attract</hi> it to an object, to the eternal <hi>Series</hi> of <hi>Fate</hi> to overbalance <hi>Epicurus</hi> his defence of mans <hi>Liberty.</hi>

For, though the Mind be contemperate of ſuch a Contexture of Atoms, as that it may be <hi>Commoved</hi> by the irruent Species of external Objects; yet is the nature of its contexture ſuch alſo, as that it can derive from it ſelf ſome motions diſtinct from, nay contrary to thoſe motions excited by Extradvenient Images; which motions being inſtituted by no other Principle but it ſelf, are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly <hi>Spontaneous</hi> and <hi>Voluntary,</hi> and by which it is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd to reſiſt <hi>External</hi> motions, and therefore may not ſo be carried to one Object, as not to be, upon advantage, deflected to another. And hence we may <hi>Conclude,</hi> that the Mind is not obliged to a neceſſity of any one Object; but ſtands <hi>Free</hi> to refuſe that, and elect another: and that the Reaſon of a thing to <hi>come,</hi> is not a little different from that of a thing already <hi>paſt;</hi> ſince, in reſpect to a thing <hi>Future,</hi> there remains an <hi>Indifferency</hi> to the Mind of electing either of two Objects, but in reſpect to a thing <hi>Praeterite,</hi> there is a <hi>Neceſsity</hi> of its election of one. If this <hi>Solution</hi> be thought too light, we can ſuperadd another of weight ſufficient to counterpoyſe the Doubt; <hi>viz.</hi> that which <hi>Carneades</hi> in <hi>Cicero</hi> inſinuated, when he taught, that the <hi>Epicureans</hi> might have defended the Liberty of mans Mind, without their commentitious <hi>Declination</hi> of Atoms. For having once declared, that the Mind hath Voluntary motions of its own inſtitution, they needed no other Argument to confute <hi>Chryſippus:</hi> to whom when they had conceded, that no motion can be without a Cauſe <hi>Movent;</hi> there remained no reaſon why they ſhould have granted, that all Effects have their <hi>Antecedent</hi> Cauſes; ſince to the will of man no Cauſes are Antecedent, it being to it ſelf the <hi>Principium à quo</hi> of all its motions Voluntary.</p>
                  <p>And this is the faithfull Abridgement of <hi>Epicurus</hi> his Doctrin concerning Fate, as a Conſtitution meerly Natural, and capable of interruption, alteration, oppoſition, by either of the Two other in his Triumvirate, <hi>viz.

And hence comes it to be embraced amongſt the moſt judicious School-men, as a truth indiſputable; <hi>That</hi> Peter <hi>will deny, not becauſe God hath prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed and praedicted that he will deny:</hi> but that, <hi>becauſe</hi> Peter <hi>will deny, when he ſhall be examined, therefore and for no other reaſon doth God Foreſee and Foretell that he will deny.</hi> For, <hi>uti Scientia, praeteritam rem pro objecto habens, nullam rei praeteritae, ut ita &amp; non alitèr fieret, neceſsitatem infert: ita Praeſcientia, rem ſuturam pro ſuo objecto habens, rei futurae, ſive Futuritioni nullam poteſt inferre neceſsitatem: utraque enim eſt extra rem, &amp; in Deo actio Immanens; that</hi> as <hi>Science</hi> having for its object a thing <hi>Praeterite,</hi> doth induce no neceſſity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; that it ſhould have bin ſo, and no otherwiſe, ſo alſo doth <hi>Praeſcience,</hi> having for its object a thing <hi>Future,</hi> inferr no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity upon its <hi>Futerition,</hi> that it ſhall ſo and no otherwiſe come to paſs; for both <hi>Science</hi> and <hi>Praecience</hi> are diſtinct from,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:49051:194"/>
and alien to their Objects, and Actions <hi>Immanent</hi> in God, <hi>i. e.</hi> not at all effluxed to the object, to the deſtruction, or alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its Nature: this, we ſay, is a Verity which demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it ſelf, and which we have more praeciſely inſiſted upon, <hi>in the</hi> 4. <hi>Articl.</hi> 4. <hi>Sect. of our diſcourſe of the Mobility of the term of mans lifè.</hi> And that all <hi>Cognition</hi> is a thing really diſtinct from, and extraneous to its Object; and that a thing comes to be actually, what it is not from the Cognition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by an Idea in all points conſimilar, but from it ſelf, or its Efficient Cauſe: needs no other probation, but the conviction of this inſtance; that <hi>Snow</hi> is white, not becauſe tis known to be white, but contrary, that it is known to be white, becauſe really it is ſo. To ſpeak a profound truth plainly, in few words; herein conſiſts the <hi>Diſparity</hi> between <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Human</hi> Cognition, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Human</hi> can be extended only to <hi>Praeſent</hi> and <hi>Praeterite:</hi> but <hi>Divine</hi> doth extend it ſelf, with equal Certitude, to <hi>Future</hi> Contingents alſo. Now, inſomuch as <hi>Praeterite</hi> Contingents were ſometimes Future, and in the ſame condition with thoſe, which are yet Future; and again, thoſe which are yet <hi>Future</hi> may be underſtood to be praeterite in time to come, and in the ſame condition with thoſe, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready Praeterite: manifeſt it is, that as neither Divine, nor Human Cognition is the Cauſe, why Contingents already Praeterite, are praeterite; but, <hi>è contrà,</hi> they are known as Praeterite, becauſe really they are ſo: in like manner, that thoſe which are Future, are not therefore Future, becauſe God holds an exact praenotion of them, as Future; but, <hi>è contrà,</hi> becauſe they really are Future, therefore doth God hold an exact prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notion of their Futurition. And upon this Baſis was it, that many Schooolmen erected that <hi>Axiom, Praeviſionem Dei nihil influere in humanas actiones;</hi> that the Praeviſion of God hath no influence <hi>(coactive)</hi> upon the actions of man. Now, what hath bin argued for the Praeviſion and Praenotion of God, is alſo to be extended to his <hi>Praediction;</hi> eſpecially becauſe tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controvertible, that Praediction is poſterior or ſubſequent to the Praenotion of any Contingent, yet in the womb of Futurity: ſince what is not exactly <hi>foreknown,</hi> can never be certainly
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:49051:195"/>
                     <hi>foretold.</hi> For which reſpect, ſhall any urge upon us, that the Divine Praenotion and Praediction cannot be <hi>Fallacious;</hi> we ſhall moſt willingly concede their poſition, as moſt indubitate, becauſe nothing can be prognoſticate by God, as Future, which is not really Future: but, when it ſhall be thence inferred, that if <hi>Peter</hi> had once the abſolute power in his own hands to have not denyed, and rightly uſing that arbitrary power, had actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally not denyed; in that caſe, the praenotion and praediction of his denyal by God had proved Fallacious; we muſt reject the <hi>Illation,</hi> as illegal and abſurd, becauſe had not <hi>Peters</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall bin realy Future, God had neither praeviſed, nor praedicted the ſame. For, it is the <hi>Reality</hi> of its <hi>Futurition,</hi> that ſupports the <hi>Certitude</hi> of the <hi>Praediction</hi> of any future Contingent. And therefore, in caſe <hi>Peter</hi> had bin not to deny; God had as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly praedicted, that He would not deny: ſince ſo the <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi> had bin quite <hi>contrary, viz.</hi> that <hi>Peter,</hi> rightly uſing his Liberty of Election, would determine it, not to a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but <hi>Affirmation.</hi> Whereupon we may ſafely conclude (1) that <hi>Peters</hi> Abnegation was Future, and (2) that God both praeviſed and praedicted the ſame, upon no other Neceſſity but only this: that <hi>Peter,</hi> when it ſhould be in his own power to determine himſelf to either part, would then actually determine himſelf rather to <hi>Diſclaim</hi> and <hi>Abjure,</hi> then own and avow, his Maſter.

                  <p>The <hi>other</hi> thus. That God did as well praedeſtinate ſome men to Glory, from his praeviſion of their Good; as others to miſery, from his praeviſion of their Evil actions. Or thus. God, from Eternity, decreed to create the World, and therein a certain number of men, who ſhould be capable of deſerving well, or ill at the hands of his Mercy, or Juſtice, according to the right uſe, or abuſe of that Liberty of their Underſtanding and Will, which He was pleaſed to endow them withall. And, compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionating the Deceptibility of their Nature, He alſo decreed to diffuſe upon the ſouls of all men, that Supernatural Aſſiſtance, which Divines call <hi>Sufficient Grace;</hi> that ſo they, who ſhould, by the right uſe of their Elective Liberty, husband their ſtock or portion of ſufficient Grace, to empower them to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of Good Actions, ſhould be Elected to Glory: but they, who ſhould abuſe both their Liberty, and his Auxiliant Grace, to the doing of Evil Actions, ſhould be Reprobated to miſery. And <hi>finally,</hi> becauſe He foreſaw, that ſome would rightly uſe his Auxiliatory Grace, and conſtantly perſevere in that ſtate of Piety untill death; and that others would neglect, condemn, and abuſe it, and never repent perfectly, but die in that horrid ſtate of Impiety: therefore did He decree everlaſting Glory to <hi>thoſe,</hi> and as laſting miſery to <hi>theſe.</hi> And this we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

The <hi>Second</hi> Opinion, to a great part, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricated from the ſame La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth.</note> ſeemes capable of extrication from the forementioned Labyrinth, without much difficulty thus. <hi>I am</hi> (ſays <hi>Adraſtus,</hi> or the Fatiſt) <hi>either Elect to glory, or Reprobate to miſery, by an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Decree of God.</hi> This we grant to be moſt true; but with this additional qualification: <hi>that Himſelf is Now the Cauſe, why He was from eternity Elect, or Reprobate.</hi> For, He is now in that very ſtate, in which God foreſaw that he would be, when educed into exiſtence, endowed with reaſon, and aſſiſted with ſufficient Grace, for the clear diſcernment of Good from Evil; and it now depends upon the Liberty of his Will, that God hath praeviſed him operating good or evil: ſo that the Decree of his Election, or Reprobation, is ſubſequent or poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to the Divine Praeviſion of his future good, or evil Demerits. To ſpeak yet louder; God therfore <hi>Elected</hi> him to Glory, becauſe He Foreſaw that he would uſe both the Liberty of his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Will, and that Supernaturall Light, or Divine Grace, which the Compaſſion of God vouchſafed for his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as he ought, to enable him to lead an honeſt and pious life: and therefore <hi>Reprobated</hi> him to miſery, becauſe He Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw that he would Abuſe the Lights of Nature and Grace, in conſtantly and impenitently doing actions point-blank repugnant to their frequent and importune Adviſoes. This being inferred, the <hi>Fatiſt</hi> cannot but perceive, that it lyes on his part, now to doe well, and with all the nerves of his Mind to <hi>Cooperate</hi> to Divine Grace: that ſo God, from eternity foreſeeing that his Conformity to the dictates of his Grace, may have Elected him.
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:49051:199"/>
For if he ſhall counterinflect his Will to the Inclinations of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace, and purſue Evil: thoſe Evil works ſhall be very they, which God from eternity having reſpect unto, hath Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him for the Guilt of them, and impoenitence for them.</p>
                  <p>Nor can He elude this truth, by pleading; that God doth <note place="margin">Article 5. The <hi>Fatiſts</hi> Subterfuge, of the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of Divine Praenotion, praecluded.</note> from eternity <hi>Foreknow,</hi> whether He ſhall be Elect, or Reprobate: and that therefore of Neceſſity he <hi>ſhall</hi> be, what he <hi>Will</hi> be; ſince the Divine <hi>Science</hi> is uncapable of <hi>Eluſion,</hi> or <hi>Mutability.</hi> Becauſe, though God, indeed, had an infallible Praecognition, from Eternity, whether he would be Praedeſtinate, or Reprobate; yet is that Praecognition grounded upon his own eternal Decree, and that eternal Decree grounded upon his eternal Praeviſion of the Fatiſts Good or Evil life. So that the actual Determination of the Will of man to the conſtant proſecution of Good, is the <hi>Baſis,</hi> or firſt Degree in this myſterious <hi>Climax</hi> of <hi>Praedeſtination;</hi> the <hi>Praeviſion</hi> thereof by God, the <hi>ſecond;</hi> the reſpective <hi>Decree</hi> of God, the <hi>third;</hi> and his indeceptible <hi>Praeſcience</hi> the <hi>fourth</hi> and laſt. Not that theſe <hi>Anteceſſions</hi> and <hi>Conſecutions</hi> are <hi>Temporany, i. e.</hi> not that the Praeſcience of God is poſterior to his Decree; and his Decree poſterior to his Praeviſion (for thoſe 3. make but one ſimple and intire Act in the Divine Intellect and Will: and Eternity is but one permanent <hi>Now,</hi> incapable of Diviſion, becauſe of Ceſſation) really, but <hi>Anthropopathically: i. e.</hi> that narrow and remote Man, when he ſpeculates the nature of his own <hi>Free-Will,</hi> and that of <hi>Divine Juſtice,</hi> as integrally <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent;</hi> is neceſſitated, for comprehenſion ſake, to ſuppoſe ſome <hi>Momenta Rationis,</hi> or Priority and Poſteriority in <hi>Eternity,</hi> as we have ſingularly enunciated <hi>in the</hi> 2. <hi>Articl.</hi> 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. <hi>chap.</hi> praecedent. <note place="margin">Article 6.
