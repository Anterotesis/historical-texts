         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </gap>d; and calling to mind the treacherous and bloody plots, conſpiracies, attempts, and practiſes of the enemies of God, againſt a true Religion, and profeſſors thereof, in all places, especially in theſe three Kingdoms ever ſince the Reformation of Religion, and how much their rage, power, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption are of late, and at this time, excreaſed and exerciſed; whereof the deplorable eſtate of the Church and Kingdom of</hi> Ireland, <hi>the diſtreſſed estate of the Church and Kingdom of</hi> England, <hi>and the dangerous eſtate of the Church and Kingdom of</hi> Scotland, <hi>are preſent and publike Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; we have now at laſt, (after other means of Supplication, Remonſtrance, Proteſtations and Sufferings) for the preſervation of our ſelvs and our Religion from atter ruine and deſiruction, according to the commendable practice of theſe Kingdoms in former times and the example of Gods people in other Nations, after mature deliberation, reſolved and determined to enter into a mutuall and ſolemn League and Covenant, wherein we all ſubſcribe, and each one of us for himſelf, with our hands lifted up to the moſt high God, do ſwear:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That we ſhall ſincerely, really, and conſtantly, through the Grace of God, endeavour in our ſeveral places and callings, the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Reformed Religion in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline, and Government, againſt our Common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the Reformation of Religion in the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> according to the Word of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We ſhall with the ſame ſincerity, reality, and conſtancy, in our ſeveral Vocations, endeavour with our eſtates and Lives, mutually to preſerve the Rights and Priviledges of the Parliament, and defend the King's Majeſties Perſon ond Authority, that the World may bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our loyalty, and that we intend not to diminiſh his Majeſſie's juſt Power and Greatneſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We ſhall alſo with all faithfulneſs endeavour the diſcovery of all ſuch as have been, or ſhall be Incendiaries, Malignants, or evil In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, by hindring the Reformation of Religion, dividing the King from his People, or one of the Kingdoms from another, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any faction, or parties amongſt the People contrary to this League and Covenant, That they may be brought to publick trial, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive condigne puniſhment, as the degree of their offences ſhall require or deſerve, or the ſupream Judicatories of both Kingdoms re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively, or others having power from them for effect, ſhall judge convenient.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And whereas the happineſs of a bleſſed Peace between theſe Kingdoms, denyed in former times to our Progenitors, is by the good Providence of GOD granted unto us, and hath been lately concluded, and ſetled by both Parliaments; We ſhall each one of us, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our place and intereſt, endeavour that they may remain conjoyned in a firm Peace and Union to all Poſterity, And that Juſtice may be done upon the willful Oppreſſors thereof, in a manner expreſſed in the precedent Article.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We ſhall alſo according to our places and callings in this common Cauſe of Religion, Liberty, and Peace of the Kingdom, aſſiſt and defend all thoſe that enter in this League and Covenant, in the maintaining and purſuing thereof; And ſhall not ſuffer our ſelves directly or indirectly, by whatſoever combination, perſwaſion or terrour, to be divided and withdrawn from this bleſſed Union and Conjunction, whether to make defection to the contrary part, or to give our Selves to a deteſtable indifferency, or neutrality in this Cauſe, which ſo much concerneth the Glory of GOD, the Good of the Kingdoms, and Honour of the King; But ſhall Conſtantly continue therein, againſt all oppoſition whatſoever; And that We are not able to ſuppreſſe, we ſhall make known, that it may be timely prevented.</p>
            <p>And becauſe theſe Kingdoms are guilty of ſo many ſins, and approvocations againſt GOD, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt, as is too manifeſt by our preſent diſtreſſes and danger, the fruits thereof; We profeſſe and declare before GOD and the World our unfeigned deſire to be humbled for our own ſins, and for the ſins of theſe Kingdoms, eſpecially that we have not, as we ought, valued the ineſtimable benefit of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that we have not laboured for the purity and power thereof, and that we have not endeavoured to receive Chriſt in our hearts, nor to walk worthy of Him in our Lives, which are the Cauſes of other ſins and tranſgreſſions ſo much abounding amongſt Us; And our true and unfeigned purpoſe, deſire, and endeavour for our Selves, and all others under our Power and Charge, both in Publick and Private, in all Duties We owe to GOD and Man, to amend our Lives, and each one to go before another in the Example of a real Reformation, That the Lord may turn away his Wrath, and heavy Indignation, and Eſtabliſh theſe Churches and Kingdoms in Truth and Peace. And this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant We make in the preſence of Almighty GOD, the ſearcher of all hearts, with a true intention to perform the ſame, as We ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer at that great Day, when the ſecrets of all hearts ſhall be diſcloſed; Moſt humbly beſeeching the Lord to ſtrengthen Us by His Spirit, and encourage other Chriſtian Churches groaning under, or in danger of the yoke of Antichriſtian Tyranny, to joyn in the ſame, or like Aſſociation and Covenant, To the glory of GOD, and the enlargement of the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>We could wiſh this, or either of them might be Revived, and by <hi>Authority</hi> be made the <hi>Touchſtone</hi> or <hi>Shiboleth</hi> of every Perſon to be <hi>Elect.</hi> But juſtly deſpairing thereof we pray you, to agree with us, (who are many thouſands) as one man, in the Rule following; Namely, That you give not your ſuffrage for the <hi>Election</hi> of any into the aforeſaid great Truſts, Who have been of any Illegal <hi>High Courts of Juſtice,</hi> or who are, or have been of <hi>Committees</hi> for <hi>Sequeſtration, Farmers,</hi> or other <hi>Officers</hi> of <hi>Exciſe</hi> or <hi>Cuſtomes,</hi> Purchaſers of of any the Late <hi>Kings, Biſhops, Deans,</hi> or <hi>Chapter Lands,</hi> or <hi>Delinquents</hi> Eſtates: Nor of their Receivors General, or any of the Officers of the preſent <hi>Army.</hi> Since, that from theſe, and many ſuch others, whoſe buſineſs hath been, and will be, to ſecure themſelves (from that Danger of the <hi>Law</hi> and ſuch <hi>Estate</hi>) from a proper reverting the due ſettlement of the <hi>Nation,</hi> or juſt Foundation cannot by Us (not by any, who are not afrighted from their Reaſons) be expected, but much rather for the gratifying of the aforeſaid Corrupt ends, to ſee our preſent <hi>Bondage,</hi> tranſmitted to our Poſterity, or at leaſt to find our Selves in little time overwhelmed with them, on their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Ruine. <q>
