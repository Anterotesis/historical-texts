            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </hi> Am confident that you expect not I ſhould give you a ſpeedy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to this ſtrange and unexpected Declaration; And I am ſorry (in the Diſtraction of this Kingdom) you ſhould think this way of Addreſſe to be more convenient, then that propoſed by my Meſſage of the <hi>20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               </hi> of Ianuary laſt to both Houſes.</p>
            <p>As concerning the grounds of your Fears and Iealouſies, I will take time to anſwer particularly, and doubt not but I shall do it to the ſatisfaction of all the World. God, in his good time, will, I hope, diſcover the ſecrets and bottoms of all Plots and Treaſons; and then I ſhall ſtand right in the eyes of all my People. In the mean time, I must tell you, that I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expected a Vindication for the Imputation laid on me in Maſter <hi>Pims</hi> Speech, then that any more generall Rumours and Diſcourſes ſhould get credit with you.</p>
            <p>For my Fears and Doubts, I did not think they ſhould have been thought ſo groundleſſe or triviall, while ſo many Seditious Pamphlets and Sermons are looked upon, and ſo great Tumults are remembred, unpuniſhed, uninquired into: I ſtill confeſſe my Fears, and call God to Witnesse, That they are greater for true Proteſtant Profeſſion, my People and Laws, then for my own Rights or Safety; though I muſt tell you, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that none of theſe are free from danger.</p>
            <p>What would you have? Have I violated your Laws? Have I denied to paſſe any one Bill for the eaſe and ſecuritie of my Subjects? I do not ask you what you have done for Me.</p>
            <p>Have any of my People been tranſport with Fears and Apprehenſions? I have offered as free and generall a Pardon, as your ſelves can deviſe. All this conſidered, There is a Iudgement from Heaven upon this Nation, if theſe Diſtractions continue.</p>
            <p>God ſo deal with Me and Mine, as all my Thoughts and Intentions are upright for the maintenance of the true Proteſtant Profeſſion, and for the Obſervation and Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Laws of this Land: And, I hope, God will bleſſe and aſſiſt thoſe Laws for my Preſervation.</p>
            <p>As for the Additionall Declaration, you are to expect an Anſwer to it, when you ſhall receive the Anſwer to the Declaration it ſelf.</p>
