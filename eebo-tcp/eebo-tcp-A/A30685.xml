         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Translator of this
ingenious and most use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Piece not survi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to see it publish'd, upon
Perusal of the Copy, I found,
the excellent Performance and
Merit of the Work did not
only deserve just Care of the
Impression, but also some Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb facs="tcp:52279:3"/>
Person to Recommend its
Appearance in the World. I
embrac'd the Opportunity I had
often wish'd, of expressing in
some measure, my Respect and
Zeal for your Lordship; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I do but Comply with all Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers
of true Worth and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
Every Body will allow,
that a better Guardian could
not be Chosen for this posthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Offspring; and your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
will easily pardon my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring
your Protection of an
Orphan. The Historical Part
of this Treatise is so Iust and
Exact, and the Remarques in
it discover so much of Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:52279:3"/>
Experience and Iudgment,
that it seem'd a proper Offering
for your Lordship's Acceptance;
who are particularly happy in
a sensible and just manner of
Thinking. Nor has your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
Felicity Terminated in a
true Discerning of Things; you
have reduc'd your Sentiments
to Practice, and prov'd the Iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of your Notions, by a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
and constant Regularity
in your Life. You have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
brought an Accession of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
to the memory of your
Noble Ancestors, by preserving
each Virtue of theirs with its
utmost Lustre, even in a vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="tcp:52279:4"/>
Age. You continue to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the World, that Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and Conversation, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
and Liberality, are
consistent Virtues. Prudence,
Iustice and Charity have carry'd
an Ascendant in the whole
Course of your Actions. You
have not only been happy in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
early made Choice of a
good Principle to direct you;
but in a constant Adherence to
its Dictates. You were from
hence instructed to express, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all Occasions, a Hearty and
Noble Concern for your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
which is the true and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Test of <hi>English</hi> Worth;
<pb facs="tcp:52279:4"/>
and I must do our Country the
Right to say, they are highly
sensible of it; as appears by that
worthy and just Character which
is universally given of my Lord
<hi>Bolingbrooke.</hi> Your Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Friends have the next
share in your Kindness; and
among the latter, I may truly
Rank all Persons of Merit.
You have declin'd no Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Obliging any Man of
Desert, and through your whole
Life, have not given Occasion
to make so much as One Man
your Enemy. Wherefore I am
safe in what I have said of
your Lordship, and the World
<pb facs="tcp:52279:5"/>
will only forgive my saying so
little, in consideration of that
Modesty which is Conspicuous
amongst your Other Virtues.
Wherefore I shall only beg Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for surprising you with this
Address, and Permission to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
my self, among the rest
of your Admirers,</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>AS I promised you, at parting, to
give you a full Account of my
Journy to <hi>Constantinople;</hi> so, I
shall now make good my Word,
and, I hope, with Advantage too. For I
shall also acquaint you with my Adventures in
my Travel to <hi>Amasia,</hi> as well as That to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi>
the <hi>former</hi> being less used, and
consequently far less known, than the <hi>later.</hi>
My design herein, is, to allow you a part of
the Solace, of what happened pleasurable to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52279:6"/>
me; for so the ancient Friendship betwixt
us obliges me, to appropriate no Joy to my
self, but to communicate the same to you;
but, as for what happen'd incommodious to
me, (as, in so long and tedious a Journey,
some things must needs do,) those I take to my
self; neither would I have you concern'd in
them, at all; for, the Danger being now past,
the more grievous they were to suffer, the
more pleasant will they be, even to my self,
to remember and commit to Writing.</p>
               <p>You are not ignorant, that, when I return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from <hi>England,</hi> after the Solemnization of
the Marriage of King <hi>Philip</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi>
at which I was present, as an Attendant, in
the Train of his Excellency <hi>Don Pedro Lassus,</hi>
who, on that occasion, was sent thither, as an
honorary Embassador, by <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> King of
the <hi>Romans,</hi> my most gracious Lord; I say,
you are not ignorant, how the said King <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand,</hi>
by his Letters, summoned me to this
Journy. I received his Commands, by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
when I was at <hi>Lisle,</hi> on the <hi>3d</hi> of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
and I made no longer stay, than to visit
<hi>Busbec,</hi> only to take my leave of my Father and
Friends; but, taking <hi>Tornay</hi> in my way, I
hastned to <hi>Brussels,</hi> where I met the aforesaid
<hi>Don Lassus,</hi> who spurred me on to the Voyage,
shewing me the King's Letters to him too,
commanding him to press me forward: So
that I immediately took Horse, and made
what haste I could to <hi>Vienna.</hi> My Journy
thither was very troublesome, both by reason
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52279:6"/>
of my unaccustomedness to ride upon such
inconvenient Horses, as I could then get;
and also because the Season of the Year was not
fit for Travel, the Weather being tempestuous,
the Ways dirty, and the Days short; so that
I was forced to borrow a great part of the
Night, and to pass through uncouth, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
unfrequented, Ways, in the dark; not
without the great hazard of my Life.</p>
               <p>Assoon as ever I came to <hi>Vienna,</hi> I was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
into the Presence of King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> by
his Secretary of State, the Heer <hi>Iohn Vander
Aa:</hi> That Prince received me with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
he used to shew to those Persons, of
whose Probity and Faithfulness he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a great Opinion: He was pleased to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
me with a large Discourse, what Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
he had promised to himself from me,
and how much it concerned him that I should
undertake this Embassy, and that speedily
too; for he had solemnly promised the Bassa
of <hi>Buda,</hi> That the Envoy, he was to send,
should be in <hi>Buda,</hi> without fail, about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of <hi>December</hi> next; and, for his part,
he was unwilling the <hi>Turks</hi> should take any
advantage to break <hi>their</hi> Agreement, upon
pretence that he had failed in performing of
<hi>his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There were but 12 Days to the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,
a space little enough to prepare for a
short Journy, much less for so long and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
a one; and yet some of those ten Days
were to be cut off too, by a Journy, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52279:7"/>
the King commanded me to make to <hi>Comora,</hi>
to visit <hi>Iohn Maria Malvezius;</hi> for the King,
my Master, thought it very advisable for
me, who had then but little Acquaintance in
the <hi>Turkish</hi> Affairs, to consult that experienced
Person, and to be informed by him, <hi>ore tenus,</hi>
of the Manners and Disposition of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for <hi>Malvezius</hi> had been <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador,
for several Years, with <hi>Solyman</hi> the
<hi>Turkish</hi> Emperor at <hi>Constantinople;</hi> even from
that very time that the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> had,
for weighty Reasons of State, made a Truce
with the <hi>Turks,</hi> by his Embassador the Heer
<hi>Gerard Velduvickius;</hi> for at the same time
also, he made an 8 Years Truce with the said
<hi>Solyman,</hi> in the Name of King <hi>Ferdinand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At that time <hi>Malvezius</hi> was one of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
of <hi>Velduvickius;</hi> and, when he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
from thence, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> sent him back
again to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to reside there as his
Embassador in Ordinary; that so he might
prevent the Incursions of the <hi>Turks</hi> upon the
Kingdom of <hi>Hungary,</hi> as having an Agent
there, who might complain to the Grand
Seignior himself of the Injuries of his Bassa's
and Governors, and demand Satisfaction for
the same.</p>
               <p>But it happened, not long after, that an
occasion being offered of uniting <hi>Transilvania</hi>
with the rest of <hi>Hungary;</hi> and the <hi>Hungarians</hi>
themselves did very much desire that it should
be done, as judging it conducive to the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
and Dignity of that Kingdom; <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:52279:7"/>
was not willing to neglect so fair an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
and therefore he transacted the
Matter with the Widow, and Son, of <hi>Iohn</hi> the
<hi>Vayvod,</hi> (who was sometimes called King of
<hi>Hungary</hi>) that he might receive <hi>Transilvania</hi>
in exchange for other Provinces; and seeing
these Transactions could not be wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
from the <hi>Turks, Rustan</hi> the Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier
(<hi>Solyman</hi>'s Son in Law, and the Chief
of his Counsellors) used to send for <hi>Malve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zius,</hi>
and to demand of him, Whether those
things were true, which were commonly brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?
He stifly affirmed, That they were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
false, and offered to pawn his Head for
the Truth of what he spake. But when <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi>
was actually possessed of all <hi>Transilva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
so that the Matter could no longer be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled,
the Grand Seignior was very angry
with <hi>Rustan,</hi> for giving so much credit to
<hi>Malvezius;</hi> and <hi>Rustan</hi> was more enraged at
<hi>Malvezius,</hi> for putting so palpable a Cheat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him. To be short, <hi>Malvezius</hi> is cast into
Prison, his Estate, Goods and Family are
seized. He was kept close Prisoner almost
two Years, under strict Guards, whereby he
contracted a Distemper, <hi>viz. Difficulty of Vrine,</hi>
which afterward proved Mortal to him, in
regard they suffered no Medicine to be brought
unto him, for the Cure of his <hi>Dysuria;</hi> for,
the truth is, the <hi>Turks</hi> are always upon the
extreme, either over-fond, when they would
shew themselves Friends; or over-bitter,
when they are Angry. But seeing the state
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52279:8"/>
of their Affairs at that time, by reason of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick
Discords, was very unsettled, and
thereupon required rather Peace than War;
and besides, the Matter of reducing <hi>Transil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania,</hi>
by Arms, went but slowly and unsuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfully
on; they were easily persuaded to
lay aside the thoughts of War, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
the Matter by a Friendly Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Matters standing thus, the <hi>Turks</hi> insisted
upon the intire Restitution of <hi>Transilvania;</hi>
but <hi>Ferdinand</hi> would by no means quit his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
therein; neither would he vacat the
Agreement with the <hi>Vayvod,</hi> as being neither
obtained by Fraud, nor extorted by Force.
And to bring down the <hi>Turks</hi> to those Terms,
<hi>Anthony Wrantzius,</hi> a <hi>Dalmatian,</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Agria,</hi> and <hi>Francis Zay,</hi> Commander of those
Gallies or small Vessels, which the <hi>Hungari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
call <hi>Saicks,</hi> (both of them faithful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious
Persons, and therefore cull'd out by
<hi>Ferdinand</hi> for that Employment) were sent
Embassadors to <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon their Arrival, <hi>Malvezius</hi> was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out of Prison, and sent back to <hi>Ferdinand</hi>
with Letters from <hi>Solyman.</hi> In a small time
after his return, he was sent back by <hi>Ferdinand</hi>
to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> with his Answer to <hi>Solyman</hi>'s
Letters; and was designed to remain, as his
Embassador in Ordinary there, when once
Peace was established between them. Being
on his Journy, when he had reached as far
as <hi>Comora</hi> (a Castle seated on the Confluence
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52279:8"/>
of the <hi>Danow</hi> and the River <hi>Vaga,</hi> a Frontire
Garison against the <hi>Turks</hi>) the Disease,
which he had contracted in Prison, returned
with such Violence upon him, that he was
forced to make a stop, and despairing of his
Recovery, he wrote to the Emperor <hi>Ferdinand</hi>
beseeching him to appoint another Embassador
in his stead.</p>
               <p>Upon the receipt of his Letter, <hi>Ferdinand</hi>
was at a stand; he did not fully believe, nor
yet altogether disbelieve, him; he was incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to suspect, that the Memory of his <hi>former</hi>
Sufferings, and the fear of <hi>future ones,</hi> did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him from that Employment, rather than
the danger of his Disease; and yet, on the
other side, he did not think it creditable for
himself to employ a Man that had so well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
of him and of the Common-wealth, in
any Service against his Will. But the Death
of <hi>Malvezius,</hi> which followed a few Months
after, did sufficiently convince him, that his
Disease was not pretended, to decline the
Employment, but was really a Mortal one.</p>
               <p>Upon this, I was substituted in the Place
of <hi>Malvezius.</hi> But being unexperienced (as
I said before) in the Affairs and Manners of
the <hi>Turks,</hi> King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> thought it advise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for me to bestow a Visit upon <hi>Malvezius,</hi>
in his Sickness; that so, by his Directions
and Advice, I might be better cautioned and
arm'd against any Impositions of the captious
<hi>Turks.</hi> Two Days I staid with him, which
was as much as the straitness of my time
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52279:9"/>
would permit; and I husbanded them so well,
as to be informed, by him, what I was to
act and what to avoid, in my daily Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with the <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon I posted back to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and
began, with great application and diligence,
to prepare Necessaries for my Journy. But
such was the flush of Business, and so little the
time allowed to dispatch it, that, when the
Day fixt for my departure came, tho' the King
did earnestly press me forward, and I had been
toilsomly busy all the day in equipping my self,
and in causing Bag and Baggage to be pack'd
up, even from the fourth Watch; yet it was
the first Watch of the following Night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I could be quite ready; but then the
Gates of <hi>Vienna,</hi> which at that time of Night
us'd always to be shut, were opened on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
for me. The Emperor went abroad a
Hunting that Day, but he told his Followers,
That he did not doubt but that I would be
upon my Way, before he returned from his
Sport in the Evening, and it fell out accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly;
yet so, that I was but just gone before
he came home.</p>
               <p>At 11 a Clock at Night, we came to <hi>Fici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum,</hi>
a Town in <hi>Hungary,</hi> 4 Miles from
<hi>Vienna;</hi> there we Supp'd, for our haste was
so great that we came Supperless out of
Town; from thence we travelled towards
<hi>Comora.</hi> The Emperor, among the rest of
his Commands, had enjoyn'd me to take along
with me to <hi>Buda,</hi> one <hi>Paul Palinai</hi> from <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mora,</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:52279:9"/>
a Man well acquainted with the Rapins
and Depredations of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and so was
best able to assist me in my Expostulations
with the Bassa of <hi>Buda,</hi> and in my Demands
for satisfaction of Injuries received. But he,
not in the least suspecting that my departure
would have been so punctual at the Day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
had not yet stirred from his own
House, and there was no Body could tell, when
he would come; which uncertainty troubled
me very much. I acquainted King <hi>Ferdinand</hi>
therewith, by Letter, and all the next Day
stayed at <hi>Comora</hi> expecting his coming.</p>
               <p>But the third Day, I passed over the River
<hi>Vaga,</hi> and prosecuted my Journy towards
<hi>Gran,</hi> the first Garison of the <hi>Turks</hi> I came
to in <hi>Hungary.</hi> Col. <hi>Iohn Pax,</hi> Governor of
<hi>Comora</hi> had sent 16 Horse with me (of those
that the <hi>Hungarians</hi> call <hi>Hussars</hi>) to be my
Guard; and he had given them a Charge not
to leave me, till they came in sight of the
<hi>Turkish</hi> Convoy, for the Governor of <hi>Gran</hi>
had signified to me, that his Soldiers should
meet me half way. We travelled about three
Hours through a vast Plain, when, behold!
there appeared afar off 4 <hi>Turkish</hi> Horse; and
yet, notwithstanding, my <hi>Hungarian</hi> Guard
accompanied me still, till I desired them to
retire; for I was afraid that if they should
come up to the <hi>Turks,</hi> some troublesome
Bickering would have intervened betwixt
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:52279:10"/>As soon as the <hi>Turks</hi> saw me to draw near,
they rode up to me, and saluted me by my
Coach-side; thus we passed on a while toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
discoursing interchangeably one with
another, (for I had a little Youth for my Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter.)
I expected no other Convoy, but
when we descended into a low Valley, I saw
my self, on a sudden, surrounded with a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of about an 150 Horse. It was a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
Spectacle to a Man, unaccustomed to see
such Sights; for their Bucklers and Spears
were curiously painted, their Sword-handles
bedeck'd with Jewels, their Plumes of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
party-coloured, and the Coverings of
their Heads were twisted with round Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
as white as Snow; their Apparel was Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-coloured,
or at least a dark Blew; they
rode upon stately Praunsers, adorn'd with most
beautiful Trappings. Their Commanders
came up to me, and after Friendly Salutation
they bid me Welcome; and asked me, how
I had fared on my Journy? I answer'd them
as I thought fit; and thus they led me to
<hi>Gran,</hi> for so the Castle is called, situate on an
Hill, whose Foot is washed by the <hi>Danow,</hi>
with a Town adjoining, built in a Plain. I
retired into the Town, the Arch-bishop
whereof is Primate of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and for Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
Authority and Opulency, is inferior to
no Nobleman of that Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Here I was entertained, not after a Courtly,
but after a Military, manner; for instead of
Beds, they spread abroad course shaggy Rugs
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52279:10"/>
of Tapestry upon hard Boards; there were no
Bed-ticks nor Sheets: Here my Family had
the first taste of <hi>Turkish</hi> Delights (forsooth;)
as for my self, I fared better, for my Bed was
carried along with me, whithersoever I
went.</p>
               <p>The Day after my Arrival, the <hi>Sanziac</hi> of
the Place (for so the Turks call a Governor,
because a <hi>Sanziac (i. e.)</hi> a gilded brass Ball,
is carried before him on the top of a Spear,
as a Cornet to a Troop of Horse) was very
earnest to speak with me; and tho' I had no
Letter, nor any other Command to deliver
to him, yet such was his importunity, that
go I must. And when I came, I found he had
no Business with me, but only to see and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
me, and to ask me something of my Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand;
and thus, exhorting me to promote a
Peace, he wish'd me a happy Journy. In
my Passage, I admir'd to hear the croaking of
Frogs in such a cold Season of the Year as the
Month of <hi>December;</hi> the cause was, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
stagnant in those Places are made warm
by sulphureous Exhalations.</p>
               <p>Leaving <hi>Gran,</hi> I went towards <hi>Buda;</hi> but,
to be sure, I took my Breakfast before-hand,
which was likely to be my Dinner also; for
there was no Place to bait at, before I came to
<hi>Buda.</hi> The <hi>Sanziac,</hi> or Governor of the
Place, with all his Family, together with the
Horse which he commanded, came out of the
Town with me, to bring me on my Way:
I could by no means persuade him to omit
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52279:11"/>
this Office of Respect. The Horse, as soon
as they came out of the Gates, began to shew
me some sport, curvetting and discharging
one against another; they threw their Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
on the ground, and Galloping their
Horses with full speed, by them, they took
them up by the Points of their Spears; and
many such Ludicrous Pranks did they perform.
Amongst the rest of them, there was a <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi>
who had thick Bushy Hair hanging down
over his shoulders; they told me, that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
went Bare-Headed, and would never
have any other fence for his Head, either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Violence of the Weather, or the
Hazards of a Battle, but his own Hair. The
<hi>Sanziac,</hi> after he had accompanied me as far
as he pleased, returned home, but not before
we had taken our leaves one of another, and
he had left some Guides for my Journy, in my
Retinue.</p>
               <p>When I drew near to <hi>Buda,</hi> a few <hi>Turkish
Chiaux's</hi> met me on the way, (they are in the
nature of Pursuivants, or Sergeants at Arms,
to carry about the Commands of the Grand
Seignior, or his Bassa's, and are Officers of
great esteem in that Nation,) by them I was
brought to Lodg in the House of a Citizen,
who was an <hi>Hungarian,</hi> where my Baggage,
Coach and Horses, was better provided for,
than my self; for the <hi>Turks</hi> take special care,
that Horses, with their Equipage, be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated;
as for the Men, if they have
but an House over their Heads to shelter them
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52279:11"/>
from the Weather, they think they may shift
well enough for themselves. The Bassa of
<hi>Buda</hi> sent one to visit me, and to bid me wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
his Name was <hi>Tuigon,</hi> (which in <hi>Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi>
signifies a Stork,) by him he excused him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to me, that he could not admit me into
his Presence for some Days, because of a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
Disease he laboured under, but as soon
as ever he recover'd a little strength, he said,
he would wait upon me. This delay was the
occasion, that the aforemention'd absence of
<hi>Palinai</hi> was less prejudicial to me, than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it would have been, (to say no more,)
for he used great diligence to post after, lest
he might come too late, and accordingly he
overtook me a little while after.</p>
               <p>I was detained at <hi>Buda</hi> a long time, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Sickness of the Bassa; 'twas thought
his Disease was Grief, which he had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for the loss of a great Sum of Mony,
which was stoln from the place in which he
had hid it, for he was commonly reported to
be a Penurious and Sordid-Spirited Man.
When he heard, that I had brought the Heer
<hi>William Quacquelben</hi> with me, a great Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
and an excellent Physician too, he ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
intreated me, that he might give him a
Visit to administer some Physick to him, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to his Cure. I easily granted his Request,
but soon after was almost ready to repent of
my Facility: For the Bassa grew worse and
worse, and, 'twas thought, he would not
have recovered; so that I was afraid, if he
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52279:12"/>
had Died, the <hi>Turks</hi> would say, my Physician
had Kill'd him; and, by that means, the
good Man might have run a great Hazard,
and I my self also might have born part of
the Infamy, as being accessory thereunto;
but it pleased God to free me from this Anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
by restoring the <hi>Bassa</hi> to his Health.</p>
               <p>'Twas at <hi>Buda</hi> I got the first sight of the
<hi>Ianizaries,</hi> so the <hi>Turks</hi> call their Praetorian
Foot; their Number, when it is fullest, is
Twelve Thousand, and their Prince disperses
them all over his Dominions, either to Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
his Forts against an Enemy, or to be a
Safeguard to <hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>Iews,</hi> against the
injurious Rage of the Multitude; for there
is no well Inhabited Village, Town, or City,
wherein there are not some or other of these
<hi>Ianizaries</hi> to Protect <hi>Christians, Iews,</hi> and
other helpless Persons, from the Fury of the
Rabble. The Castle of <hi>Buda</hi> is always Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd
by them; their Habit is a long Garment
down to their Ankles; upon their Heads they
wear the Sleeve of a Coat, or Cloak, (for
from thence, as they say, the Pattern was
drawn,) their Head is put into part of it,
and part of it hangs down behind, flapping
upon their shoulders; in the Front, or Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
of it, there ariseth a Silver-Cone, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
long, guilt over with Gold, and
wrought with Jewels, but they were of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
sort. These <hi>Ianizaries</hi> usually came
to me by Couples; when they were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into my Dining-Room, they bowed down
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52279:12"/>
their Heads and made Obeysance, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
they ran hastily to me, and touched ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
my Garment, or my Hand, as if
they would have kiss'd it; and then
forc'd upon me a Bundle, or Nosegay, of <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acinths,</hi>
or <hi>Narcissus</hi>'s, and presently they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
backward, with equal speed, to the Door,
that so they might not turn their Backs upon
me, (for that is accounted undecent, by the
Rules of their Order,) when they came to
the Door, there they stood, with a great deal
of modesty and silence, with their Hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Breasts, and fixing their Eyes upon
the ground, so that they seemed liker <hi>our</hi>
Monks, than <hi>their</hi> Soldiers. But when I had
given them some Cash, (which was the only
thing they aimed at,) they bowed their
Heads again, and giving me thanks with a
loud Voice, they wished me all happiness, and
departed. The Truth is, unless I had been
told before, they were <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> I should
have thought them to have been a kind of
<hi>Turkish</hi> Monks, or Fellows of some College
or other amongst them. Yet these are the <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries</hi>
that carry such a 'Terror with them,
wheresoever they come.</p>
               <p>Some <hi>Turks</hi> supp'd with me often at <hi>Buda,</hi>
and were mightily taken with the delicious
sweetness of my Wine: It is a Liquor that
they have but little of in <hi>Turky,</hi> and therefore
they more greedily desire it, and drink it
more profusely, when once they come where it
is. They continued Carousing till late at
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52279:13"/>
Night, but afterwards I grew weary of the
sport, and therefore rose from Table, and
went to my Chamber; but as for Them, they
went away sad, because they had not their full
swing at the Goblet, but were able to stand
upon their Feet. As soon as I was gone, they
sent a Youth after me, desiring me to let them
have their Fill of Wine, and that I would
lend them my Silver-Cups to drink it in;
for they were willing, by my leave, to sit at
it all Night in some Corner or other of the
House. I granted their request, and ordered
so much Wine to be given them, as they desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
with Bowls to drink it in. Being thus
accommodated, they tippled it out so long,
till they were even Dead-drunk, and tumbling
down, lay fast asleep upon the ground. You
must know, that it is a great Crime in <hi>Turky</hi>
to drink Wine, especially for those who are
well stricken in Years; as for the Younger
sort, they think the Offence to be more Veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
and therefore more excusable in them.
But seeing they expect no less Punishment, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Death, for drinking a little Wine, than
if they drank never so much, when once they
have tasted of that Liquor, they go on to
drink more and more; for having once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd
the Penalty of their Law, now, they
think, they may sin <hi>gratis,</hi> and account Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness
as a matter of Gain. This Opinion,
and others mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e absurd than This, do the
<hi>Turks</hi> hold concerning Wine, of which I
will give you a remarkable Instance: I saw an
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52279:13"/>
Old Man at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> who, after he had
taken a Cup of Wine in his Hand to Drink,
us'd first to make an hideous Noise; I asked his
Friends, Why he did so? They answered me,
that, by this Outcry, he did as it were warn
his Soul to retire into some secret corner of
his Body, or else wholly to Emigrate, and
pass out of it, that she might not be guilty of
that Sin which he was about to commit, nor
be defiled with the Wine, that he was to guz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle
down.</p>
               <p>But to return to <hi>Buda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Twould be too tedious for me to give you
a large Description of this Place, and it were
a Task fitter for one that writes a Book, not
a Letter; yet not to be wholly silent, <hi>Buda</hi>
lies in a pleasant place, and in a very fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Country, it is extended all along the Brow
of an Hill, so that on one side it borders on a
rising ground, abounding with choice Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards,
and on the other side it is watred by
the River <hi>Danow,</hi> running by it; and beyond
the <hi>Danow,</hi> there is the Town of <hi>Pest,</hi> and a
large Campain adjoining, both which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
are in view of <hi>Buda,</hi> so that this Place
seems naturally designed for the Metropolis of
<hi>Hungary.</hi> It was anciently Adorned with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
stately Palaces, belonging to the Nobles of
<hi>Hungary,</hi> but those goodly Piles are now ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
quite fallen to the ground, or else have
many Props to support them from tumbling
down; they are Inhabited mostly by the
<hi>Turkish</hi> Soldiers, whose daily Pay being but
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52279:14"/>
enough to support them, they have no over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus
to lay out in Tyling, or Repairing, such
large Structures; and therefore they do not
much regard, whether it Rains thro' the
Roof, or whether the Walls be full of Clefts,
provided they have a dry place to set their
Horses, and their own Beds, in; the upper
part they think concerns them not, so that
they make a great part of the upper Stories
to be Inhabited by Weazels and Mice.</p>
               <p>Besides, 'tis a piece of Religion in <hi>Turky,</hi>
not to covet Magnificent Buildings; for,
(say they) 'tis a sign of a Proud, Lofty,
and Aspiring Mind, to covet Sumptuous
Houses, as if so frail a Creature as Man did
promise a kind of Immortality, and an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Habitation, to himself, in this Life;
when alas! we are but as Pilgrims here, and
therefore ought to use our Dwellings, as Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellors
do their Inns, wherein if they are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
from Thieves, from Cold, from Heat,
and from Rain, they seek not for any other
Conveniencies. So that all over <hi>Turky</hi> you
will hardly find a stately House, tho' the
Owner of it be never so great, or Rich, a
Man; the Commonalty of them live in Huts
and Cottages; the Nobles are for handsome
Orchards, Gardens, and Baths; but as for
their Houses, tho' the Numerousness of their
Families require large ones, yet they have no
handsome Gate-houses, or Porches, belonging
to them, nor Court-Yards, nor any thing else
Magnificent, or worthy of any Admiration.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52279:14"/>
Herein they resemble the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> for, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<hi>Buda,</hi> and (perhaps) <hi>Presburgh,</hi> there
is scarce any City in <hi>Hungary</hi> that you can call
well-built. This Custom, I suppose, they
derived from their Ancestors, for they being
a People given to Camp-discipline and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
trained, did not care a rush for building
great Houses, but looked upon their Towns
only as Temporary Habitations, which they
were about to leave.</p>
               <p>Moreover, whilst I was at <hi>Buda,</hi> I was very
much taken with the sight of a strange kind of
Fountain that is without the Gate of the
Town, in the way leading to <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
the Water whereof at top was boyling hot,
and yet in the bottom there were Fishes play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up and down; so that you would think,
they must needs be throughly boyled, before
you could take them out.</p>
               <p>'Twas the 7<hi>th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> before the Bassa
was so well recovered as to admit me to his
Presence; and then, after I had sweetned
him with some Presents. I made my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
to him of the Insolency and Ravagings
of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Soldiers; and demanded Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of what they had wrongfully taken
away, contrary to the express Articles of the
Truce made, and which he himself, in his
Letter to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> had promised him satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for, if he pleased to send an Envoy to
<hi>Buda.</hi> But he, like a cunning Gamester, made
as many Complaints of the Injuries and Los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
They had sustained by Our Soldiers: And as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52279:15"/>
for his Promise to restore the Places they had
wrongfully seized and taken away from the
Emperor; he eluded it, by sheltring himself
under this Dilemma, <hi>Either I made a Promise, or
I did not;</hi> if I made no Promise, then you can
demand nothing of me: If I did make a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
I know, Sir, you are a Person of that
Understanding as not to conceive, that I can
or will perform it; for I am sent hither by my
Master to enlarge, not to diminish, the Bounds
of his Empire, so that I must by no means
make his condition worse than it was; 'tis
my Master's Business, (Sir) not Mine; what
you have to say on this Head, pray propound
it to him, when you come to <hi>Constantinople:</hi>
To be short, Sir, you know I am but newly
recovered, and therefore am not in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to maintain any further Discourse.
When this course Complement was put upon
me, I thought 'twas time to be gone, neither
could I get any thing else from him, only a
Truce, till the Grand Seignior's mind was
known.</p>
               <p>I observed, that when I was introduced to
the Bassa, they observed the old <hi>Roman</hi> Custom
of crying aloud, <hi>Welcom, Welcom;</hi> and so
wishing an happy Issue to my Negotiation:
I observed also, that the <hi>Turks</hi> count the Left
Hand to be most Honourable in some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Cases; the reason they give, is, because
the Sword is worn on that side, and he that is
on the Right Hand has, as it were, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Sword of him that is at his Left,
whereas his Own is free,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:52279:15"/>Matters being thus composed at <hi>Buda,</hi> as
well as we could, my Companion <hi>Palinai</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to the Emperor, but I, for my part,
shipp'd my Horses, Coaches, and all my Family
on some Vessels, prepared for me on the
<hi>Danow,</hi> and so passed down the Stream to
<hi>Belgrade;</hi> this was a shorter Cut, and also
more secure; for my Journy by Land to
<hi>Belgrade</hi> would at that time have cost me at
least 12 Days, especially having such a deal of
heavy Baggage with me; and, besides, we had
been in danger to be Robb'd by the <hi>Heyduc's,</hi>
so the <hi>Hungarians</hi> call a sort of plundering
Thieves and Robbers: But upon the Water
there was no fear at all of them; and, besides,
we compassed our Journy in 5 Days. The
Vessel, in which I was, was drawn along by
a lesser Pinnace, in which there were 24 Oars;
the other Vessels had but two large Oars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece.
The Mariners rowed Night and Day
without any intermission, excepting only a
few Hours that the poor Souls borrow'd to
sleep and eat in. In my Passage down the
River, I could not but observe the venturous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
not to say temerity, of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who
were not afraid to sail on in the mistiest Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in the darkest Night, and when the Wind
blew very hard, too; and, besides, there were
many Water mills, with several Trunks and
Boughs of Trees hanging over the Banks,
which made our Passage very dangerous; so
that some times our Vessel, by the boisterous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Wind, was driven to the Bank,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52279:16"/>
and there dash'd against old stumps of Trees
hanging over, so that it was like to split;
this is certain, that she lost some Planks out
of her Hulk, which made a terrible crack and
noise when they were loosed therefrom. This
noise awak'd me; leaping out of my Bed I
advis'd the Mariners to be more cautio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s;
they lift up their Voices, and gave me no
other Answer than <hi>Alaure,</hi> i. e. <hi>God will help,</hi>
and so I might go to Bed again, if I would.
Tho' We sped pretty well, yet I am apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that, at one time or other, such dangerous
Sayling will be fatal to some Passengers. In
our Passage, I saw <hi>Tolna,</hi> a handsome Town
in <hi>Hungary;</hi> I cannot forbear to mention it,
because there we had very good White-wine,
and, besides, the Inhabitants were very cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
to us. Moreover, we passed in sight of
the Castle of <hi>Walpot,</hi> seated on an Hill, and
of other Castles and Towns besides; we saw
also where the River <hi>Drave,</hi> on the one side,
and the <hi>Tibiscus,</hi> or <hi>Taise,</hi> on the other, made
their Influx into the <hi>Danow.</hi> As for <hi>Belgrade</hi>
it self, it is seated at the confluence of the <hi>Save</hi>
and the <hi>Danow;</hi> the old City is built in the
extreme Angle of the Promontory, the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is old, it is fortified with many Towers
and a double Wall: Two parts of it are
wash'd by the <hi>Save</hi> and the <hi>Danow,</hi> but on
that part where it is joyned to the Land, it
hath a very strong Castle on high Ground,
consisting of many lofty Turrets made of
square Stone; before you come into the City,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52279:16"/>
there is a vast company of Buildings, and very
large Suburbs, wherein several Nations do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit,
<hi>viz. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>Turks, Greeks, Iews, Hungarians,
Dalmatians,</hi> and many others. For you must
know that ordinarily over all the <hi>Turkish</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
the Suburbs are larger than the
Towns, but take them both together, they
give the resemblance of large Cities: 'Twas
at this Town, that I first met with some anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Coins, wherein, as you know, I take a
great delight, and my Physician aforesaid,
Dr. <hi>Quacquelben</hi> fitted me to an Hair, as we
say, for he was as much addicted to those Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
as my self. I found a great many pieces,
which on one side represented a <hi>Roman</hi> Soldier,
plac'd between a <hi>Bull</hi> and a <hi>Horse,</hi> (for 'tis
known, that the Legions of upper <hi>Moesia</hi> did
anciently encamp hereabouts) with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
<hi>Taurunum.</hi> This City, in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of our Grandfathers, was twice vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
assaulted by the <hi>Turks,</hi> first, under
<hi>Amurath;</hi> next, under <hi>Mahomet</hi> who took
<hi>Constantinople;</hi> but the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> under the
Banner of the Cross, made such a vigorous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
that the <hi>Barbarians</hi> were beaten off
with a great deal of loss. But at last, in the
Year, 1520. <hi>Solyman,</hi> in the beginning of his
Reign, came before it with a vast Army, and
finding it, either by the neglect of young King
<hi>Ludovicus,</hi> or by the Discords of the factious
<hi>Hungarian</hi> Nobles, destitute of a Garison able
to defend it, he took that opportunity to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
it, and so easily became Master thereof.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52279:17"/>
And that Door being once opened, an <hi>Iliad</hi> of
Miseries broke in upon poor <hi>Hungary,</hi> of
which she is sadly sensible to this day; for
this Pass being gained, there followed the
Slaughter of King <hi>Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Neighbouring Nations, lest they also should
partake of the same Calamities: By which
Example, <hi>Christian</hi> Princes may take warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
never to think their Frontier Towns and
Castles to be strong enough, nor sufficiently

<hi>Turk.</hi> For the truth is, the <hi>Ottomans</hi> are
herein not unlike to great Rivers, whose swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Waves, if they break down any part
of the Bank or Jitty that keeps them in,
spread far and near, and do abundance of
mischief; so the <hi>Turks,</hi> but far more perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

having once broke through the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacles
that stopt them, make a vast spoil
where-ever they come. But to return to <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade,</hi>
that I may prosecute the rest of my
Journy to <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After I had provided my self in that City
of all things necessary for a Land-Journy, I
left <hi>Semandria,</hi> heretofore a Town or Castle of
the Despots of <hi>Servia</hi> on the left side of the
<hi>Danow;</hi> from whence we journied towards
<hi>Nissa.</hi> In our way thither, the <hi>Turks</hi> shewed
us, from the higher Grounds, the Mountains
of <hi>Transilvania,</hi> with snowy Tops, but at a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52279:17"/>
great distance from us; and, moreover, they
pointed with their Fingers, where the Ruins
of <hi>Trajans</hi> Bridge were: After we had past the
River called <hi>Morava,</hi> we came to a Town of
the <hi>Servians,</hi> named, <hi>Iagodna;</hi> there I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
the Funeral Rites of that Country,
which differ very much from ours; as you
may find by this Relation following.</p>
               <p>The dead Body was placed in a Temple,
with the Face uncovered; near it were laid
Victuals, as Bread, Flesh and a Flagon of
Wine: The Wife and Daughter of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased
stood by, in their best Apparel; the
Daughters Hat was made of Peacocks-fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
The last Boon that the Wife bestowed
on her dead Husband, was a purple Bonnet,
such as noble Virgins us'd to wear in that
Country. Then we heard their Funeral
Plaints, Mournings and Lamentations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they asked the dead Corps, How they came
to deserve so ill at his Hands? Wherein had
they been wanting in their Duty and Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
that he had left them in such a lonesom
and disconsolate Condition? And such like
Stuff. The Priests that ministred in this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
were of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church. In the
Church-yard, there were erected on Poles or
long Staves, several Pictures of Stags, Hinds
and such kind of Creatures, cut in Wood;
when I asked them the reason of this strange
Custom, they told us, That their Husbands
or Fathers did thereby signifie the celerity and
diligence of their Wives or Daughters in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52279:18"/>
managing their Houshold Affairs. Moreover
by some Sepulchres, there hung Bushes of
Hair, which Women or Maidens had placed
in testimony of their grief for the loss of
their Relations. We were also informed,
that it was the custom of that Country, after
Friends on both sides had accorded about the
Marriage of a young Couple, for the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
to snatch away his Bride, as it were by
force; for they do not think it handsome,
that a Maid should consent to her own Devir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
or first Nights Lodging with her
Husband.</p>
               <p>At a small distance from <hi>Iagodna,</hi> we met
with a little River which the neighbouring In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
called <hi>Nissus,</hi> and we kept it on our
right hand almost all the way till we came to
<hi>Nissa;</hi> yea, and beyond the Town, upon the
Bank thereof, (where there were some remains
of an old <hi>Roman</hi> Way) we saw a small Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Pillar, yet standing, wherein there were
some Latin Letters inscribed, but they were
so defaced, that they could not be read: As
for the Town of <hi>Nissa,</hi> for that Country, it
is a decent one, and full of Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>'Tis time now to acquaint you with the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
we met with at our Inns, for I
believe you long to know. When I came to
<hi>Nissa,</hi> I lodged in a publick Inn, the Turks
call them <hi>Caravasarai,</hi> of which there are a
great many in that Country; the Form of
them is this, it is a large Edifice, that has
more of length than breadth; in the midst
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52279:18"/>
of it there is a kind of Yard for the placing of
Carriages, Camels, Mules and Wagons. This
Yard is compassed about with a Wall about
3 Foot high, which joins, and is, as it were,
built in the outward Wall, that incloses the
whole Building; the top of this inner Wall
is plain and level, and is about 4 Foot broad.
Here the <hi>Turks</hi> lodge, here they sup, and
here is all the Kitchen which they have, (for in
the ambient Wall, before spoken of, there
are ever and anon some Hearths built) and here
are no Partitions between Camels, Horses
with other Cattel, and Men, but the space of
that inner Wall; and yet at the foot of that
Wall, they so tye their Horses that their
Heads and Necks are above it, or at least may
lean over it; and thus when their Masters are
warming themselves at the Fire, or else are at
Supper, they stand near them as Servants us'd
to do; and sometimes they will take a piece
of Bread or Apple, or whatsoever else is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
them, out of their Masters Hand. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the same Wall, the <hi>Turks</hi> make their Beds,
after this manner, first of all they spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
a piece of Tapestry, which is fitted as
a Saddle-cloth by day, for their Horses: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that they put their Cloaks; their Saddles
serve for a Pillow; and with the long Vests
they wear at day, they cover themselves at
night. And thus they take their rest, never
provoking Sleep by any other Allurement.
There is nothing done in secret, there all is
open, and every Body may see what another
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52279:19"/>
does, unless the darkness of the night do
hinder him. For my part, I did greatly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
this sort of Lodging, because the Eyes of
all the <hi>Turks</hi> were continually upon us, stare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and wondring at our carriage, according
to the Customs of our Country. And, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I always indeavoured to lodge at the
mean House of some poor Christian! but,
alas! their Cottages were so small, that many
times I had not room enough, in them, for
placing my Bed; so that sometimes I slept in
my Tent, sometimes in my Coach, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
again I turned into the <hi>Turkish</hi> Hospitals;
which, to give them their due, are very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
and not unhandsomly built, for they
have several distinct Apartments for Lodgings
in them. There is no Man forbid the use of
them, either <hi>Christian</hi> or <hi>Iew,</hi> Rich or Poor,
they are open equally to all. Even the <hi>Bassa's</hi>
and <hi>Sanziacs,</hi> when they travel, make use of
them. In these I thought my self lodg'd as
well as in the Palace of a Prince.</p>
               <p>The Custom of these Inns, like Hospitals, is
this: They allow Victuals to every particular
Man, that comes in as a Guest: So that when
Supper time came, there was a Servant that
brought in a great wooden Dish almost as big
as a Table; in the middle of it was a Platter full
of Barley boyled to a Jelly with a little piece
of Flesh, and about the Platter were some
small Loaves, and here and there a piece of an
Hony-comb. When I saw this, at first, out
of Modesty, I refused it, saying, that my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52279:19"/>
were preparing my own Supper for
me, and therefore advis'd them to give it to
the Poor: He took it amiss, and prest it upon
me, alledging, that I should not scorn their
slender Provision, that the Bassa's themselves
us'd to eat of it; it was the custom of their
Country so to do; they had enough left to
give to the Poor; and if I would not eat it
my self, I should give it to my Servants; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
I was enforced to take it, that I might
not be counted uncivil by them. Take it
then I did, and after I had tasted a little of it,
I gave him thanks. The relish of it pleas'd
me well, for that kind of Gruel, as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by <hi>Galen,</hi> so it is very wholesome,
and not unpleasing to the taste. Travellers
may be entertained with that kind of Diet for
3 days, but when that time is expired, they
must pack up and be gone. Here (as I told
you) I was well intertain'd, but I met not always
with such good Quarters. Sometimes, when
I could not light upon an House, I lodged in
a Stable; my People enquired after a large
and capacious one, in one part whereof was
an Hearth and a Chimney, and the other part
was design'd for the Herds of Cattle; for that
is the Make of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Stables, that the
Herd and the Herdsman do lodge under the
same Roof. I divided that part where the
Fire was from the rest, by the sides of my
Tent, and then I put my Table and my Bed
by the Fire-side, and liv'd like an Emperor:
As for my Family, they wallowed in a great
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52279:20"/>
deal of clean Straw, in the other part of the
Stable: But some of them fell asleep by the
Fire-side in the adjoining Orchard or Meadow
where Supper was a preparing; the heat of
the Fire was their guard against the coldness
of the night, and they had as great a care not
to let it go out, as the <hi>Vestal Virgins</hi> had of old
at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I suppose, you will ask me, how my Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
did relieve themselves against the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
of their bad Lodging; especially seeing
they could have little Wine in the middle of
<hi>Turky,</hi> which might have been some Remedy
for their ill Lodging at night. For the truth
is, there is little Wine to be had in several
of their Villages, especially if no <hi>Christians</hi>
dwell among them: For I must tell you, that
the <hi>Christians</hi> being wearied out with the Pride
and Insolency of the <hi>Turks,</hi> do many times
withdraw themselves from the common Road
into desert Places; which tho' they are less
fruitful yet are more secure; and so leave their
better Possessions to the domineering <hi>Turks.</hi>
And whenever we drew near to any such Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
where there was no Wine, the <hi>Turks</hi>
would very fairly tell us of it beforehand; so
that I sent my Steward the day before, with
a <hi>Turk</hi> to guide him, to procure some from
the next Villages of the Christians. And by
this means it was, that the Distresses of my
Family were something alleviated; 'tis true,
I could not get any soft Featherbeds or Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
for them, or other Blandishments for
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52279:20"/>
sleep; the Wine was instead of all: As for my
self, I had some Flagons of choice Wine in my
Chariot, so that I wanted none; thus I and
my Family were provided for, as to Wine.</p>
               <p>But there was one Inconvenience, which
troubled us more than the scarcity of Wine,
and that was, our sleep was miserably inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted;
for we being to rise betimes in the
Morning, and sometimes before day, that we
might come the sooner to our Inns at Night,
our <hi>Turkish</hi> Guides, being deceived by the
light of the Moon, would sometimes call us
up at or about Midnight, with a great deal of
noise and clamour. For the <hi>Turks</hi> have no
Clocks to distinguish Hours, nor Miles to
shew the distance of Places: Only they have
a sort of Ecclesiasticks, which they call <hi>Talis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi>
this sort of People use a kind of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurement
by Water, and when they
perceive thereby, that 'tis Morning, then
they cry aloud from an high Tower, built on
purpose, exhorting them to arise and worship
God. They make the same noise in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
between Sun-rise and Noon; and likewise,
between Noon and Sun-set; and, last of all,
when the Sun is set, they cry out, with a
very shrill Voice, which hath no unpleasant
Modulation, and which is heard farther than
any Body would think. Thus the <hi>Turks</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the day into four spaces, longer or
shorter, according to the Season of the Year:
But for the Night-time, they have no certain
Rule at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:52279:21"/>So then our <hi>Turkish</hi> Guides being deceived
by the brightness of the Night (as I told you
before) called us up before Sun-rising, and
we started out of our Beds in great haste, that
so they might not impute any unlucky Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
upon the way, to our slothfulness; in
the Morning, we pack'd up our Baggage, and
put my Bed and Tent in our Wagons, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed
our Horses, and were ready for our
Journy; only expected the word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
But (would you think it?) our
<hi>Turks,</hi> when they found their Mistake, fairly
went into their Nests again; and after we had
waited for them a great while, I sent to them,
to tell them, we were all ready; and now the
delay was on <hi>their</hi> side, my Messengers brought
me word, from them, that the Moon-light
had deceived them, and, therefore, they were
gone to sleep again; for it would be a great
while before it would be time to go; and they
persuaded us to try to sleep again too. And,
thus, we must either unpack all our things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
to our no small trouble; or else we must
endure a great part of the coldness of the
Night in the open Air.</p>
               <p>To prevent this Inconvenience for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
I charged the <hi>Turks</hi> not to be so trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
any more, as to rouse me out of my
sleep; for if they would but tell me over
Night, at what time they would rise in the
Morning, I would be sure to be ready at the
time appointed; for I had Watches, by me,
that I intended to make use of, which would
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52279:21"/>
not fail to acquaint me with the precise Hour
of the Morning; and if they over-slept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they should lay it to my charge; so
that they need not scruple to trust me with the
Hour of their rising. They seem'd to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
satisfied herewith, and yet did not lay
aside all their Solicitude neither; for in the
Morning betimes, they awaken'd my <hi>Valet de
Chambre,</hi> desiring him to go to me, and to
see how the Index of my Watches did point;
he did so; and returned Answer to them, as
well as he could, That 'twas much or little
to Sun-rising, according as he found it. When
they had thus tried him once or twice, and
found that he hit the Time right, they trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me for the future, and admir'd the Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of our Watches, that could so faithfully
declare the Time; so that ever after, we
slept out our sleep, without any Disturbances
from them.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Nissa</hi> we came to <hi>S. Sophia;</hi> the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thither, and the Weather, for that time
of the Year, was very tolerable. <hi>Sophia</hi> is a
Town big enough, and well inhabited both by
Citizens and Strangers: It was heretofore the
Royal Seat of the King of <hi>Bulgaria;</hi> and
afterwards (if I mistake not) of the <hi>Despots</hi>
of <hi>Servia,</hi> whilst that House stood, before it
was overthrown by the <hi>Turkish</hi> Arms.</p>
               <p>Afterward, we continued our Journy, for
many Days, through the pleasant, and not
unfruitful, Vally, of <hi>Bulgaria;</hi> all the time
we were in that Country, we had little other
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52279:22"/>
Bread, but only Cakes bak'd under Ashes upon
the Hearth; they call them <hi>Togatch.</hi> The
Women and Maids sell them, (for they have
no Bakers in those Parts;) and when they
perceive any Guests a coming, that are likely
to pay for what they have, presently they
knead a little Dough, with Water, without
any Leaven; and lay it (upon Tiles) under
the Ashes, and so bring it out piping hot, as
we say, and sell them for a very small Matter;
other Victuals is also very cheap there; a good
Weather-sheep may be bought for 35 Aspers;
a Chicken and a Hen will cost but an Asper;
a sort of Coin with them, of which 50 make
but a Crown.</p>
               <p>I must not omit to acquaint you with the
Habit of those <hi>Bulgarian</hi> Women. They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
wear nothing but a Smock or Shift,
made of no finer Linen-thread, than that we
make Sacks of. And yet these course Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were wrought, by them, with several
sorts of Strip'd-needle-work after a homely
fashion: With this loose party-coloured Habit
they mightily please themselves, so that when
they saw our Shifts, made of the finest Linen,
yet they wondred at our Modesty, that we
could be contented to wear them without va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Works of divers Colours wrought in
them.</p>
               <p>But that which I most of all admired in
them, was the Tower, (if I may so call it,)
which they wore on their Heads, for such was
the Form of their Hats. They were made of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52279:22"/>
Straw braided with Webs over them. The
Figure of them doth differ from the Hats
Women wear in our Country, for Ours hang
down on the shoulders, and the lowest part of
it is the broadest, and so it arises as it were
into a Pyramid, at Top; but Theirs is nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowest
below, and so rises up like a Top, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Nine Inches above the Head, but that
part of it that looks upwards, towards the
Sky, is both very capacious, and also open,
so that, it seems made to take in Rain, and
Showers, as ours are to shelter us against them;
but in that space interjacent between their up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and lower part, there hang pieces of
Coin, little Pictures or Images, small parcels
of painted Glass, or what-ever is resplendent,
tho never so mean, which are accounted very
ornamental among them.</p>
               <p>Those kind of Hats do make them look tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
and also more Matron-like, tho' they are
easily blown off their Heads, by a blast of
Wind, or by any light motion they fall off
themselves.</p>
               <p>When they appeared to us in this Dress,
methought, they resembled <hi>Clytemnestra</hi> or
some <hi>Hecuba</hi> or other, (in the flourishing time
of <hi>Troy</hi>) coming upon the Stage. This Sight
suggested to me some pious Meditations, <hi>viz.</hi>
How frail and mutable a thing that which is
called <hi>Nobleness of Birth, is;</hi> for when I ask'd
of some of these Lasses, they that seem'd to
be the handsomest among them, concerning
their Stock and Lineage, they told me, They
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52279:23"/>
were descended from the chief Nobles of
that Country; and some of them were of a
Royal Progeny, tho' now it was their Fate,
(as they said) to marry Herdsmen or Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds.
For Nobility is very little esteemed
in the <hi>Turkish</hi> Dominions. For I my self did
afterwards see, at <hi>Constantinople</hi> and other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
some Descendants from the Imperial Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
of the <hi>Catacuzeni</hi> and the <hi>Paloeologi,</hi> liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more contemptuously among the <hi>Turks,</hi>
than ever <hi>Dionysius</hi> did of old at <hi>Corinth;</hi> nay,
the <hi>Turks</hi> esteem no Men for their Birth, but
only for their own perform'd Accomplishments,
excepting only the <hi>Ottoman Family;</hi> for That
they have a high Veneration, upon account
of its Original.</p>
               <p>It is thought that these <hi>Bulgarians</hi> had their
Original from <hi>Seythia,</hi> near the River <hi>Volga,</hi>
and that they changed their Habitations and
came into these Parts, when other Nations,
either compelled by force or prompted by
choice, changed theirs; and that they were
called <hi>Bulgarians,</hi> i. e. <hi>Volgarians,</hi> from the
River <hi>Volga,</hi> aforesaid. Upon this transmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration
they fix'd their Habitation upon those
Parts of Mount <hi>Hoemus,</hi> that lie between <hi>Sophia</hi>
and <hi>Philippopolis,</hi> which are Places naturally
strong; where they, for a long time, baffled
all the Power of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperors, and
kill'd <hi>Baldwin</hi> the Elder, Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> then
Emperor of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> after they had
taken him in an hot Skirmish. Yet for all this
they were not able to resist the Power of the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52279:23"/>
                  <hi>Turks,</hi> but were overcome and miserably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slav'd
by them. They use the <hi>Illyrian</hi> or <hi>Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonian</hi>
Tongue, as the <hi>Servians</hi> and <hi>Rascians</hi>
also do.</p>
               <p>Before a Man descends into that Plain that
lies over against <hi>Philippopolis,</hi> he must go
through a Forest and a craggy Mountain,
which the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Capi Dervent,</hi> i. e. <hi>The
Gate of the strait or narrow Passage;</hi> but in the
Plain, before mentioned, we met with the
River <hi>Hebrus,</hi> having its Original from the
adjoining Mountain, <hi>Rhodope.</hi> Before we
could pass the said Straits, we saw the top of
Mount <hi>Rhodope</hi> all cover'd over with deep
Snow. The Inhabitants, as I remember, call
it <hi>Rulla.</hi> From hence flows the River <hi>Hebrus,</hi>
as <hi>Pliny</hi> says, and <hi>Ovid</hi> also affirms the same in
this Distick.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Qua patet umbrosum Rhodope glacialis ad Hoemum,</l>
                  <l>Et sacer amissas exigit Hebrus aquas.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Where Icy <hi>Rhodope</hi> ope's to shady <hi>Hoeme,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And sacred <hi>Hebrus</hi> wants part of her Stream.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>In which Verses, the Poet seems to intimate
the shallowness of that River for want of
Water. For tho' it be a great and famous Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
yet, in most Places, it is fordable: For,
I remember, in my return from <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
we forded over the same <hi>Hebrus,</hi> near <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popolis,</hi>
to an Island on the other side, where
we lay in our Tents all Night; but so it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52279:24"/>
that the Waters swelled that Night by
reason of Rain, so that the next Morning we
could not repass the River, to come into the
Road, without a great deal of trouble.</p>
               <p>The City of <hi>Philippopolis</hi> is situate on one of
the three little Hills, disjoyned, and, as it
were, rent from the rest of the Mountains,
and is as the grace of those little Hillocks.
While we were at <hi>Philippopolis,</hi> we saw Rice
growing, like Wheat, in the watry and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shy
Grounds. The whole Plain, about the
Town, is full of little round Hills of Earth,
which, the <hi>Turks</hi> say, were raised on purpose,
as Monuments of the frequent Battles fought
in those Fields, and the Graves of such as
were slain there. From hence, leaving the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Hebrus,</hi> something on the Right, and
Mount <hi>Hoemus,</hi> which runs forth into <hi>Pontus,</hi>
on the left, at last we passed over the <hi>Hebrus</hi>
on a famous Bridge, made by <hi>Mustapha,</hi> and
so came to <hi>Hadrianople,</hi> which the <hi>Turks</hi> call
<hi>Endrene.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This City was formerly called <hi>Orestia,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Emperor <hi>Hadrian</hi> inlarged it, and
called it by his own Name. It is seated at the
confluence of the River <hi>Mariza</hi> or <hi>Hebrus,</hi>
and the two small Currents of <hi>Thinsa</hi> and
<hi>Harda,</hi> which there meeting in a joint Stream
run into the <hi>Egean Sea.</hi> This City is not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
large within the Walls; but, if you take
in the Suburbs a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d the Buildings which the
<hi>Turks</hi> have added without, it is very capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:52279:24"/>We staid but one day at <hi>Hadrianople,</hi> and
then went forward on the last Stage of our
Journy towards <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to which we
drew nearer day by day. In my way thither,
there grew abundance of <hi>Narcissus's, Hyacinths,</hi>
and (as the <hi>Turks</hi> call them) <hi>Tulips,</hi> which we
beheld, not without admiration, that in the
midst of Winter, which is not favourable to
such Flowers in other Countries, the Ground
should be so garnished by them. As for <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissus's</hi>
and <hi>Hyacinths's,</hi> all <hi>Greece</hi> abound with
them; and they are so odoriferous, that, by
reason of their multitude, they are offensive
to those Heads that are unaccustomed to such
kind of Smels. But the <hi>Tulip</hi> hath little or
no Smell, but its gaudiness and party-colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
is its greatest commendation. The <hi>Turks</hi>
are great Admirers of Flowers, so that, tho'
they are parsimonious enough in other cases,
yet for a stately Flower, they will not scruple
to give some <hi>Aspers.</hi> And the truth is, these
kind of Flowers, tho' they were presented
to me as a Gift, yet they cost me a great deal
of Mony; for some <hi>Aspers</hi> were always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
in requital. Neither is there any other
way of treating with a <hi>Turk,</hi> but by opening
the Purse-strings, as soon as any <hi>Christian</hi>
comes among them; neither must he think to
shut them again, till he go out of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
While he is there, he must scatter his
Coin, and if he get no other advantage by it,
yet it makes them more tracta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> For the
<hi>Turks</hi> are so ill-natured, and such undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52279:25"/>
of all Nations, but their own, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this Open-handedness, there were no more
living among them, for Strangers, than in the
most desolate and uninhabited Places, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the excessiveness either of Cold or
Heat; but with the bait of Liberality, you
may catch a <hi>Turk</hi> at any time.</p>
               <p>About the mid-way between <hi>Hadrianople</hi>
and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> there is a little Town, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>Chiurli,</hi> memorable for the <hi>overthrow</hi>
which <hi>Selimus</hi> received in a Battel against his
Father <hi>Bajazet,</hi> out of which he escaped by
the swiftness of his Horse, called, <hi>Carabonluch,</hi>
(i. e.) a <hi>Black Cloud,</hi> and so fled to the <hi>Cham,</hi>
or the <hi>Precopeian Tartar,</hi> who was his Father-in-Law.</p>
               <p>Before we came to <hi>Selimbria,</hi> which is a
Town standing on the Sea-side in our way,
we saw the Ruins of an old Wall and Ditch,
which were made by the later Emperors of
<hi>Greece,</hi> which reached from that Sea to the
<hi>Danow,</hi> to secure all that was contain'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
that Fortification to the <hi>Constantinopolitans,</hi>
against the Incursions of the <hi>Barbarians;</hi> and
there goes a Story, that when that Wall was
a Building, a certain old Man delivered his
Opinion to his Wife, <hi>viz.</hi> That that Wall
would not so much secure what was within it,
from the hands of the Infidels, as it would
expose and subject it to their rage and fury, in
regard it would add Courage to the <hi>Barbarians</hi>
to assault it, and weaken the Courage of the
<hi>Grecians</hi> to defend it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:52279:25"/>At <hi>Selimbria</hi> we had a most pleasant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of a calm Sea; and 'twas very pleasant
to us to behold the smooth Water, and to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Cockles on the Shore; yea, to behold
Sholes of <hi>Dolphins</hi> sporting in the Water,
which, with the warmness of the Air, was
very delightful to us. It can hardly be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
how mild the Weather was in those
Parts, tho' sometimes it be a little more
boistrous at <hi>Chiurli;</hi> but here there is, as I may
call it, a <hi>Thracian Gale,</hi> and an incredible
sweetness of Air.</p>
               <p>When we came near to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> we
passed over two pleasant Arms of the Sea, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Bridge built over them. I may safely
say, That if those Places were cultivated by
Art, as they are naturally Pleasant, the Sun
never shone on a better Country; but, alas!
they seem to mourn for the neglect put upon
them, by the insulting <hi>Barbarian.</hi> Here we
had our fill of choice Sea-fishes, which were
even taken in our sight.</p>
               <p>When I lodged in those Inns, the <hi>Turks</hi> call
<hi>Imaret,</hi> I usually observed, that the cracks of
the Walls were all full of pieces of Paper;
and thinking something was the matter, but
not knowing what, I took out some of them,
and finding nothing writ therein of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
I was more earnest to know of the
<hi>Turks</hi> the reason of their so doing; especially,
seeing I had observed the same thing in other
Places of <hi>Turky,</hi> before. At first, they scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
to tell me, as thinking, perhaps, that I
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52279:26"/>
would not believe them; or else, not being
willing to impart so great a Mystery of things
to such an Alien as my self. This made me
the more inquisitive, till at last some of them,
with whom I became more familiar, told me,
That the <hi>Turks</hi> gave a great deal of deference
to Paper, because the name of God may be
written in it: And, therefore, they will not
suffer the least bit of Paper to lye upon the
Ground, but presently they take it up, and
thrust it into some chink or hold or other, that
so it may not be trampled under foot;
and hitherto, perhaps, their Superstition may
be tolerable, but mark what follows.</p>
               <p>In the day of Judgment, say they, when
<hi>Mahomet</hi> shall call up his Followers from their
<hi>Purgatory,</hi> (to which they were condemned
for their Sins) to Heaven, to be there made
Partakers of Eternal Blessedness; There will
no way be left for them to come to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
but over an huge red-hot Iron Grate,
which they must run over bare-foot, (how
painfully, you may guess, when you imagine
a Cock to skip thro' hot-burning Coals.) But at
that instant, (believe it if you can!) all those
Bundles of Paper, which they have preserv'd
from being trod upon, will immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
and put themselves under their Feet;
by which means, they will pass the Iron red-hot
Grate with less damage; so necessary do
they count the work of saving a little Paper.
And, to add to the Story, I remember that
my <hi>Turkish</hi> Guides were once very angry with
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52279:26"/>
my Servants, for making use of Paper to cleanse
their <hi>Posteriors,</hi> and thereupon made a griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Complaint to me of their horrid Offence,
therein; I had no way to put them off, but
by telling them, 'twas no wonder my Servants
did do such strange things, seeing they also
us'd to eat Swines Flesh, which the <hi>Turks</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor.
Thus I have given you a taste of the
<hi>Turkish</hi> Superstition; I shall add, That they
account it a damnable Sin, if any of their own
People chance (tho' unwillingly) to sit upon
the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> (which is a Book, containing the
Rites of their Religion;) and, if a <hi>Christian</hi>
do it, 'tis Death by their Law. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
they will not suffer <hi>Rose-leaves</hi> to lye
upon the Ground, because, as the Ancients
did fable, the Rose does spring out of the
Blood of <hi>Venus;</hi> so the <hi>Turks</hi> (forsooth) hold,
That it had its rise from the Sweat of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met:</hi>
But I cloy your Stomach with these
Trifles.</p>
               <p>I came to <hi>Constantinople</hi> on the 20<hi>th</hi> day of
<hi>Ianuary,</hi> and there found my Collegues above-mentioned,
<hi>Anthony Wrantzius</hi> and <hi>Francis Zay;</hi>
as for the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> himself, he was, at
that time, at the Head of his Army in <hi>Asia,</hi>
and had only left, at <hi>Constantinople, Ebrahim</hi> Bassa,
an <hi>Eunuch,</hi> as Governor of the City, and <hi>Rustan,</hi>
but deprived of his Visier-ship; however, I
gave him a Visit and made him Presents, as
being mindful of his former Dignity, and of
the fair Prospect there was of his speedy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
thereunto.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:52279:27"/>It may, perhaps, divertise you, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
it is not wholly foreign to my design, to
acquaint you how this <hi>Rustan</hi> came to be strip'd
of all his former Honours. Know then,
That <hi>Solyman</hi> begat a Son, called <hi>Mustapha,</hi> on
a Concubine of his, born by the <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> (if I
mistake not) this Youth was in the prime of
his Age, and in great favour among the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
But the same <hi>Solyman</hi> had several other
Children by <hi>Roxolana,</hi> whom he doted on so
much, that he made her his Wife, by appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her a Dowry; for that's the way of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and firming a Marriage among the <hi>Turks.</hi>
This <hi>Solyman</hi> did, contrary to the Custom of
former Emperors, none of which had ever
marry'd a Wife, since the days of <hi>Bajazet</hi> the
Elder; the reason was, because the said <hi>Baja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet,</hi>
being overthrown by <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> was, with
his Wife, taken Prisoner by him, where he
suffer'd many Indignities, but none affected
him more, than the Uncivilities and Reproaches
which he saw offer'd to his <hi>Sultaness,</hi> before his
Face. The memory of which Affronts made
such a deep Impression on all those that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<hi>Bajazet</hi> in the Empire, that, to this very
day, none of them will marry a Wife, that
so, whatever chance should happen, they
might never fall into the like Indignity; so
that, ever since, they beget Children on Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of a servile condition, in whose Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
they may be less concern'd, than if they
were their lawful Wives. And yet the Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,
begot on such Concubins, are as much
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52279:27"/>
esteem'd by the <hi>Turks,</hi> as if they were born in
lawful Wedlock, and they have as much right
to their Fathers Estates.</p>
               <p>So then, <hi>Mustapha,</hi> being of a promising
Ingenuity, and in the flower of his Age; and
besides, being the Darling of the Soldiers,
and the Common-People too, having so many
favourable Circumstances attending him, he,
after his Father's Death, who was now very
old, was by the Votes of all designed for his
Successor, in the Empire: On the other side,
his Stepmother, <hi>Roxalana,</hi> with might and
main, laboured to prevent it, and to secure the
Empire for the Children begotten on her own
Body, and thereupon presuming on her Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-Relation,
she ceased not to disparage
<hi>Mustapha,</hi> and to prefer a Younger Son of her
own before him. In this design <hi>Rustan</hi> was
both her Counsellor, and her Assistant too;
they drew both in one Yoke, for <hi>Rustan</hi> having
Married a Daughter of <hi>Solyman</hi>'s, by <hi>Roxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lana,</hi>
their Interests thereupon were conjoined,
and twisted one in another.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Rustan</hi> was the chief of the Bassa's,
and <hi>Solyman</hi>'s Prime Vizier, having the chief
Power and Authority with him: He was a
Man of a sharp and very capcacious Wit, and
a great Grace to <hi>Solyman</hi>'s Government. As
for his Original, he was the Son but of a
Shepherd, and yet he seemed worthy of that
Dignity, to which he was advanced, if his
fordid Avarice had not been a Blot in his Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutcheon.
And to speak truly, <hi>Solyman</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52279:28"/>
did observe this Vice in him, tho' upon
all other accounts, he was his choice and only
Favourite: And yet this Crime of his turn'd
to his Masters advantage, for being appointed
by <hi>Solyman</hi> to preside over his Treasury, or
Exchequer, which sometimes was very low,
he was so thrifty in the management of that
Office, that he did not spare to raise Mony,
even by the meanest and most contemptible
ways. For he laid a Tax on Herbs, Roses,
and Violets, which grew in great Men's Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens;
he caused the Armour, Coats of Male,
Warrior's Horses, of such as were taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners
in War, to be sold, and by such ways
as those he got together such a Mass of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
that <hi>Solyman</hi> was very secure on that part;
upon this occasion, I remember, that a great
Man among the <hi>Turks,</hi> who are usually vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
enough, that was a great Enemy to <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan,</hi>
yet (to my surprize,) told me, That
he would do <hi>Rustan</hi> no hurt, tho' it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so much in his power, because his Care
and Industry had advanced his Masters Treasury
to so prodigious a Sum. There is a Chamber in
the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> over which
there is this Inscription, <hi>This is the Cash ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the diligence of</hi> Rustan.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Rustan</hi> was Grand Visier, and had
the intire Administration of all things in his
hands, he was able to turn his Master's mind,
hither and thither, as he pleased, so that
'twas commonly reported among the <hi>Turks,</hi>
That partly by the Accusation of <hi>Rustan,</hi> and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52279:28"/>
partly by the Witchcraft of his Wife <hi>Roxola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
(for she was accounted little better than a
<hi>Sorceress</hi>) <hi>Solyman</hi> was so alienated from his
Son <hi>Mustapha,</hi> that he took Counsel to put
him to death. As to what some alledge, that
<hi>Mustapha</hi> being sensible of the Designs of
<hi>Rustan</hi> and his Step-mother <hi>Roxolana,</hi> against
his Life, did labour to preserve them, by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off his Father, and so seizing the Empire
by force; very few do believe that Story,
but look upon it as a <hi>Fiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On this Occasion, let me tell you, that the
Sons of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Emperors are the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest
Creatures in the World; for if any one
of them succeed his Father in the Empire, the
rest are inevitably put to death by him. For
the <hi>Turks</hi> cannot endure any Corrival in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
and, besides, they are egged on to
this severity by their <hi>Proetorian</hi> Bands (<hi>Iani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries</hi>
and <hi>Spahies)</hi> who, as long as there is any
one of the <hi>Grand Seigniors</hi> Brothers alive, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
cease craving of Largesses and Boons, and,
if the present Emperor refuses to grant them,
they presently cry out, <hi>God save your Brother,
God send your Brother a long Life;</hi> by which
words they more than intimate their Wishes,
that he were in the Throne: So that the
<hi>Turkish</hi> Emperors are, in a manner, compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to put their Brethren to death, and so do
begin their Reigns with Blood. But <hi>Mustapha</hi>
was afraid of such a fatal end; or else <hi>Roxola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
was willing to translate the said Destiny
from her own Children upon <hi>Mustapha:</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52279:29"/>
one or other of these Grounds, it was, that
<hi>Solyman</hi> entertain'd the thought of putting his
Son <hi>Mustapha</hi> to death. And the occasion
fell out opportunely, for he had War, at that
time, with <hi>Sagthama</hi> King of the <hi>Persians,</hi> thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Rustan</hi> was sent with a vast Army. When
he drew near to the Borders of <hi>Persia,</hi> upon
a suddain he made a stop, and wrote back
fearful Missives to <hi>Solyman;</hi> telling him, <hi>That
the whole Empire was in great hazard, there was
nothing but Treason studied in the Army, they all
cry'd out</hi> A Mustapha, A Mustapha; <hi>yea, the
Disease was grown to such an heighth, that 'twas
past his skill to cure it; and, therefore, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
himself must come, immediately, if he
would have the Crown sit safe on his Head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solyman</hi> was mightily disturb'd at the News,
and, therefore, posted away towards the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and sends Letters to <hi>Mustapha</hi> to come to
him, to purge himself from those Crimes,
whereof he was formerly suspected, but now
openly accused; if he could do it, he told
him, he need no fear to approach his Presence.
Upon the receipt of this Letter, <hi>Mustapha</hi> was
in a great streight; if he should go to his Father,
in such an angry mood, he ran upon his death;
if he refus'd, that would be interpreted, as a
plain Confession of the objected Crimes. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this Dilemma, he resolved upon that
course, which as it had more of Resolution in
it, so it was fullest of Danger. Away, then,
goes he from <hi>Amasia,</hi> of which he was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor,
to his Fathers Camp, which was
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52279:29"/>
pitch'd not far from the place. This he did,
either out of confidence of his own Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
or else presuming on the Assistance of
the Army, if any severity were meditated
against him; whatever was the motive of
his Journy, this is certain, that he ran una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably
upon his own destruction; For <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
ever since he was at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to put him to Death; and to make the
matter more plausible, he consulted the <hi>Muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
(so the <hi>Turks</hi> call the chief of their Priests,
as <hi>Romanists</hi> call theirs the Pope,) and that
he might not speak to him in favour of <hi>Musta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,</hi>
he propounded to him a feign'd Case,
thus, <q>There was a Wealthy Merchant at
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> who having occasion to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
a long Journy from home, left the care
of his Family, his Wife, and Children, and
all his Affairs, to a Slave of his, in whose
Fidelity he put a great deal of confidence;
now this Slave, immediately after his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
design'd to destroy his Masters Wife
and Children, committed to his Care, to
embezil his Estate, and to work against his
Masters own Life, in case he should ever get
him into his power; What may be lawfully
done, said he, to the <hi>Mufty,</hi> with such a
Slave?</q> 
                  <hi>He deserves,</hi> says the <hi>Mufty, to be
Racked to Death.</hi> Whether he spoke really as he
thought, or whether he did not do it to curry
favour with <hi>Rustan</hi> and <hi>Roxolana;</hi> This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that the Resolution of the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi>
was greatly confirm'd thereby to put his Son
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52279:30"/>
to Death, for he was of Opinion, <hi>Mustapha</hi>'s
offence against him, was as great, as that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
Slaves against his Master. However it
were, <hi>Mustapha</hi> came into his Fathers Camp,
the whole Army being very solicitous about
the event of their Congress.</p>
               <p>Soon after he was brought into his Fathers
Tent, where all things were hush; not a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
of the Guards to be seen, no Serjeant, no
Executioner, in view, nor nothing of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,
that was visible; but when he was
come into an inner Tent, Lo! upon a sudden,
there started up Four Mutes, strong and lusty
Fellows, to be his Executioners; they set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him with all their strength and might, and
endeavoured to cast a Cord about his Neck;
he defended himself stoutly for a while, (for
he was a Robust Young Man,) as if he had
contended not only for his Life, but for the
Empire, also; for without Question, if he
had escaped that danger, and had come in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> they either out of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to him, whom they dearly loved, or
else, moved with the Indignity of the Thing,
would not only have saved his Life, but have
gone near to have Proclaimed him Emperor;
And that was the very thing, which <hi>Solyman</hi>
fear'd of all things in the World, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
perceiving, as he stood behind a Linen
Vail in the Tent to behold the Tragedy, that
an unexpected stop was put to his Bloody De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
he peep'd out his Head, and gave the
Mutes such a sour and minacious Look, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52279:30"/>
of their remisness, that thereupon they
assaulted him with renew'd Force, and then
threw poor <hi>Mustapha</hi> down on the ground,
and strangled him; and after they had done,
they carried his Corps out of the Tent, and
laid it on a piece of Tapestry, that so the <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries</hi>
might behold their design'd Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</p>
               <p>As soon as the matter was divulged, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseration
and Grief seized on the whole
Camp, and there was scarce a Man of any
Consideration, in the whole Army, that did
not approach to behold so sad a Spectacle, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
the <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> whose Consternation
and Rage was such, that they would have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
to attempt any manner of mischief what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
if they had had a <hi>Leader.</hi> As for
him, whom they hop'd to be their Conductor,
he lay dead on the ground, and therefore now
there was no way but one, to take that pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
which was past all Remedy.</p>
               <p>Thus they silently departed with blubbered
Eyes, and sad Hearts, to their Tents, where
they both lamented and pitied the woful Fate
of an unhappy <hi>Mustapha,</hi> sometimes inveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against the Madness and Rage of his old
Doating Father, at other times exclaiming at
the Fraud and Cruelty of his Step-Mother,
and anon Cursing the Wickedness of <hi>Rustan,</hi>
with direful Imprecations for extinguishing so
great a Light of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family, so that all
that Day was a Fasting-Day to them, they did
not sip so much as a drop of Water; yea,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52279:31"/>
some of them continued their Abstinence for
many Days after. In short, there was such a
Face of Mourning over the whole Army,
which was not like to cease in many Days,
that <hi>Solyman</hi> in Policy, and in a seeming Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with the sentiments of his People, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
<hi>Rustan</hi> of his Office, (it was thought
by his own consent,) and Banished him, as a
private Person to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> substituting
<hi>Achmat</hi> Bassa to the <hi>Grand-Vizier-ship</hi> in his
room, a Man of more Courage than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>
               <p>Upon this alteration, the publick Grief
was somewhat abated, and the Soldiers Rage
pacified; for the Commonalty was made to
believe, (as you know the Vulgar are Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
enough,) That <hi>Solyman</hi> at last had found
out the Wickedness of <hi>Rustan,</hi> and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments
of his Wife; and that now, he
repented, tho' it were late, first, of his Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
to <hi>Mustapha,</hi> and thereupon had banish'd
<hi>Rustan</hi> from his presence, and that he would
not spare his Wife neither, as soon as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> As for <hi>Rustan,</hi> he
pretended great sorrow, and departed to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi>
without seeming to have the least
hope, ever to be restor'd to his former Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>But alas! <hi>Roxolana,</hi> was not content with
the destruction of <hi>Mustapha,</hi> as long as he had
an only Son, who was yet in his Minority,
alive; for she did not think her own, or her
Childrens security, to be sufficiently provided
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52279:31"/>
for, as long as any of <hi>Mustapha</hi>'s Race were
alive; but she wanted a fair pretence to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
her Design, nor was it long before
she found <hi>One.</hi> She represented to <hi>Solyman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
that as often as his Grandchild, <hi>Mustapha</hi>'s
Son, went abroad at <hi>Prusa,</hi> were he was
brought up, the Youth of that City were wont
to flock about him, to wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h him all Happiness,
and particularly to pray, <hi>That he might long
survive his Father:</hi> And whither (said she)
can this tend, but to prompt him to mount
the Throne, and revenge his Father's death?
and to be sure, the <hi>Ianizaries</hi> will take his part,
(added she;) and thus the death of <hi>Mustapha</hi>
alone will add little Security to the publick
Peace and Tranquillity. Religion (proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
she) is to be preferred before even the
Lives of our own Children; and seeing that of
the <hi>Musselmans,</hi> (for so they call their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as counting it the best) stands and falls
with the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family; if that House fail,
farewel Religion also. And how can that
House stand, if Domestick Discord under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
it? And therefore, Sir, if you will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the ruin of your House, your Empire
and your Religion, you must use all manner
of means; nay, you must not stick at Parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
it self, if homebred Disagreement and
Feud may be thereby prevented; for the
Safety of Religion will over-ballance the Loss,
even of a Man's own Children. As for <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stapha</hi>'s
Son, you have the less reason to
spare him, because his Father's Crime hath
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52279:32"/>
already infected him, and there is no doubt,
but, if he be suffered to live, he will soon
endeavour to Head a Party, to revenge his
Fathers death.</p>
               <p>By these Reasons, <hi>Solyman</hi> was induced to
yield to the Murder of his Grandchild, and
thereupon sent <hi>Ebrahim</hi> Bassa to <hi>Prusa,</hi> to
destroy the Innocent Youth. As soon as the
<hi>Bassa</hi> came thither, he made it his great Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to conceal his intended Design from the
Child's Mother; for, he thought, it would
be look'd upon as an inhuman thing in him,
to cut off a Youth, with the privity of his
Mother, and, as it were, before her Eyes.
And, besides, he was afraid, the People would
rise in Arms upon the perpetration of so cruel
a Fact; and therefore, at first, Fox-like, he
sets his Wits at work to deceive the Mother.
He pretended, that he was sent by <hi>Solyman</hi>
out of respect to her and her Son, to visit
them; that his Master saw his Error, in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Son to death, which he now, too late,
repented of; but that the crueller he had been
to the Father, the more indulgent he would
be to his Son; and many such colloguing
words he used, whereby he imposed upon the
too credulous Mother, who was the rather
induced to believe him, because of <hi>Rustan</hi>'s
Disgrace and Fall; and to crown his Flattery,
he presented them with many Gifts. This
past on for a day or two, and then some Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
was administred concerning their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abroad, out of the City, to enjoy the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52279:32"/>
fresh Air. And the <hi>Bassa,</hi> being an Eunuch,
persuaded her, the next day, to take a turn
in the Suburbs, she in her Coach, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
with her Son, would ride afore on
Horseback. The Matter seemed not to afford
any suspicion, and, therefore, she consented,
and a Chariot is prepared for her; but (mark
the Fraud!) the Axle-tree of the Coach was
so made, on purpose, that it must needs
break, when it came to be jogged in any
rough way. Thus she, in an unlucky time,
began her Journy out of the City. The
Eunuch and the Child rode a pretty way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as if they had occasion for some private
Discourse, and the Mother speeded after as
fast as she was able; but when the Coach came
to the design'd craggy Place, the Wheel vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
hit against the Rocks, and so the Axle-tree
broke. This the Mother looked upon
as an unlucky Omen, and, therefore, in a
great Fright, she could not long be restrain'd
from leaving her Coach, and with a few of
her Maids from following her Son on foot.
But, alas! 'twas too late; for the Eunuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come to the House, design'd for the
Slaughter, without any more ado, shew'd the
Child the Emperor's Mandate for his death.
He answered, according to the Principles of
their Religion, That he look'd upon that
Command as proceeding not from the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
but from God, which must necessarily be
obey'd, and so he yielded his Neck to the
Row-string.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:52279:33"/>Thus dyed this innocent and hopeful Youth.
When the Eunuch had perpetrated this
wicked Fact he stole out at a Back door, and
fled as fast as he could. The Mother, soon
after, beginning to smell out the Fraud,
knocks at the Door; when they thought fit,
they open'd it, and there she saw her Son
sprawling on the Ground, his Breath being
yet hardly out of his Body. Here let me draw
a Vail; for a Mothers Affection to a Son, in
such a lamentable juncture, may be better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
than expressed. Upon this dismal sight
she was hurried back to <hi>Prusa;</hi> where she
tore her Hair, rent her Garments, filled the
whole Town with Howlings, Moans and
Plaints. The <hi>Prusian</hi> Ladies, with their
Daughters and Waiting-maids, came in Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
to her, and were stark mad to hear of
so great a Butchery; and running in that rav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
manner out of the Gates, all the Cry was,
<hi>Where's the Eunuch? Where's the Eunuch? Let's
have him to tear him to pieces:</hi> But he, foresee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what would happen, and fearing, like
another <hi>Orphe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

those raging Furies, had cunningly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
himself, and was out of Gunshot, as
we say.</p>
               <p>But to return to my purpose. As soon as
I came to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> Letters were sent to
<hi>Solyman,</hi> then at <hi>Amasia,</hi> to acquaint him with
my Arrival; and, till his Answer was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd,
I had leisure to take a view of the
City of <hi>Constantinople;</hi> and, first, I had a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52279:33"/>
mind to visit the Temple of St. <hi>Sophia,</hi> which
I was not admitted to do, but by special fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
for the <hi>Turks</hi> think that their Temples
are prophaned, if a <hi>Christian</hi> do but put his
foot within them.</p>
               <p>That Church is a magnificent Pile, and a
worthy Structure to behold. It hath a great
Arch or Hemisphere in the middle, which
hath no light but only from the Sky: All the
<hi>Turkish Mosks</hi> are built after the Form of this.
Some say<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> That heretofore it was much larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and contained many Apartments, which
were all destroy'd by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and only the
<hi>Quire</hi> and <hi>Nave,</hi> in the middle of it, stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>As for the situation of the City it self, it
seemed, to me, to be naturally placed as fit to
be the Mistress of the World; it stands in
<hi>Europe,</hi> and hath <hi>Asia</hi> in view, and on its
right, had <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Africa;</hi> which though
Countries not adjacent to it, yet by reason of
frequent Entercourse and naval Commerce;
they seem, as it were, contiguous. On its
left Hand is the <hi>Euxin Sea,</hi> and the <hi>Palus
Maeotis,</hi> whose Banks are inhabited round
about by many Nations, and so many navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable
Rivers have their Influx into them, that
there is nothing grows in any of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
thereabouts, fit for Mans use, but there
is a great conveniency of transporting it by
Sea to <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the one side, it is wash'd with the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pontis;</hi>
on the other, the River makes an Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52279:34"/>
which <hi>Strabo</hi> calls, <hi>The Golden Horn</hi>
from the Similitude it hath to an Horn; on
the third side it is joyned to the rest of the
Continent, so that it almost resembles a
Peninsule; and with the continu'd back of a
Promontory, it runs out into the Sea and a
Bay, which is made there by the River and
the Sea. So that from the middle of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi>
there is a most pleasant Prospect
into the Sea, and even to the Mount <hi>Olympus,</hi>
in <hi>Asia,</hi> which bears a snowy Head all the
Year long. The Sea there, is wonderful full
of Fish, which sometimes swim down from
the <hi>Maeotis</hi> and the <hi>Euxine,</hi> through the <hi>Bos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus</hi>
and <hi>Propontis,</hi> into the <hi>Aegean</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean
Seas,</hi> and sometimes they swim
from thence into the <hi>Euxin,</hi> according to the
nature of the Fish; and that in Shoals so thick
and numerous, that you may catch them with
your Hands. So that here is excellent Fishing
for <hi>Mackrel, Tunny, Cod, Porpois</hi> and <hi>Sword-Fish.</hi>
But the <hi>Greeks</hi> fish more than the <hi>Turks,</hi>
though these later love, Fish well enough;
provided, they be of the number of those,
which they count <hi>clean;</hi> as for others, they
had rather eat Poyson than taste them, for,
(let me tell you by the by) a <hi>Turk</hi> had rather
his Tongue or his Teeth were pluck'd out of
his Head, than taste of any thing they think
to be <hi>unclean,</hi> as a <hi>Frog,</hi> a <hi>Snail</hi> or a <hi>Tortois.</hi>
And, herein, the <hi>Greeks</hi> are every jot as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
as they; of which I will give you
the Instance following.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:52279:34"/>I entertain'd, in my Family, a Youth of the
<hi>Greek</hi> Religion; I employ'd him as my Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard.
The rest of my Servants could never
persuade him to eat any <hi>Periwinkles</hi> or <hi>Cockles;</hi>
but, at last, they put a trick upon him; they
caus'd them to be so high-season'd and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd,
that he, mistaking them for another
sort of Fish, fed upon them most heartily.
Whereupon, my People set up a Laughter,
and threw down the Shells before him,
whereby he perceiv'd himself to be cozen'd:
Whereupon, 'tis incredible to relate how
much he was troubled. He went presently
to his Chamber, and there fell a Vomiting,
Weeping and Afflicting himself most griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
without any Intermission; insomuch,
that two Months Sallary was not sufficient to
expiate this Offence; for that's the Guise of
<hi>Greek</hi> Priests, according to the kind and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Offence, they lay a pecuniary
Mulct upon those who come to <hi>Confess,</hi> and
they never <hi>Absolve</hi> them till they pay it down
to a Penny. So much for my <hi>Greek.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the furthest Point of that Promontory
which I mentioned before, stands the Palace
(or <hi>Seraglio)</hi> of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Emperors: To
me it did not seem very magnificent, either
for Work or Workmanship, (for, you must
know, that, as yet, I had not made an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into it.) Under the Palace, in a low
Ground, and, as it were, upon the Sea-shoar,
are the Gardens of the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi>
where the greatest part of <hi>Old Byzantium</hi> is
thought to have stood.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:52279:35"/>I hope you do not expect to be informed,
by me, why the <hi>Chalcedonians,</hi> who built a
City over against <hi>Byzantium,</hi> (the Ruins of the
Place are yet to be seen) were Sirnam'd <hi>The
Blind;</hi> nor shall I tell you the nature of that
Sea, which always runs downward with a vast
Stream, but never recoils with any Tide;
nor will I spend time to speak of those <hi>Haut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos</hi>
which were brought to <hi>Constantinople</hi> from
the <hi>Palus Moeotis,</hi> such as the <hi>Italians</hi> call <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronella's,
Botargues</hi> and <hi>Caviare;</hi> the descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of all these Particulars would swell my
Epistle to too great a Bulk, (which I think
is big enough already) and, besides, it would
be needless; for both the <hi>Ancients,</hi> and also
<hi>Modern</hi> Writers, have given Information of
those Particulars at large.</p>
               <p>To return, then, to the site of <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
There is no Place, in the World, more
pleasantly seated to the Eye, nor more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for Trades. But, let me tell you,
that the Building therein (as in all other <hi>Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi>
Cities) are not magnificent, nor are
their Streets stately or large; nay, in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi>
they are so narrow, that they much
eclipse the Beauty of the Place; yet there are
in it some valuable Relicks of old Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to be seen, but not so many, as a Man
would imagin, considering how many <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantin</hi>
brought thither from <hi>Rome.</hi> It is not
my purpose to insist upon each of these Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
yet a word or two of the principal
ones.</p>

Pillars, <hi>One</hi> over against the <hi>Caravaserai,</hi>
where I lodged, and the <hi>Other</hi> in the <hi>Forum,</hi>

<hi>The Womans Court,</hi> wherein, from bottom to
top is engraven the History of a certain Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of one <hi>Arcadius,</hi> who built it, and
whose Statue, for a long time, stood a top
thereof. And yet it may rather be called a
<hi>Stair-Case</hi> than a <hi>Pillar,</hi> because it goes wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up like a pair of Stairs. I caused the
shape of this Pillar to be drawn, which I have
by me. But the other Pillar, over against the
House the <hi>German</hi> Embassadors use to lodge in,
the whole Structure, besides the Basis and the
Chapiter, consists of 8 solid Marble or Red
<hi>Porphyry</hi> Stones, so curiously joyned together,
that they seem, (as the Vulgar believes them
to be) but one continued Stone. For where
the Stones are jointed one into another, upon
that Commissure there is wrought a circular
Garland of Lawrels round about the Pillar,
which hides the jointing, so that they which
look upon it from the Ground, perceive no
jointing at all. That Pillar hath been so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
shaken by Earthquakes, and so battered
by Fires happening near it, that it is cleft in
many places, and they are forced to bind it
about with Iron-hoops, that it may not fall to
pieces.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:52279:36"/>They say, That the Statue of <hi>Apollo</hi> once
stood upon that Pillar, and that afterwards
the Statues of <hi>Constantine</hi> and of <hi>Theodosius</hi>
the Elder were erected there; but they are all
thrown down, either by the force of the
Winds, or by Earthquakes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> tell this Story concerning the

found, who undertook to raise it up to
its Place, but he demanded a vast Reward for
his Pains; after the price was agreed on, he
prepar'd abundance of Ropes, Pullies and
other Instruments, and by that means he
lift'd up that vast Stone within one Inch of
the Place where it was to stand; but his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<hi>Apparatus</hi> being able to raise it no higher,
the People, who in great numbers were his
Spectators, were of Opinion, that all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Cost and Pains was lost, and he must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
anew to try to do the Feat some-other
way, to his vast Expence and Charge. But
he himself was not discourag'd, but being
skilful in <hi>Mechanick Philosophy,</hi> he caused a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of Water to be brought up to him,
which, for many hours, he cast upon the
Ropes, at which the <hi>Obelisk</hi> hung; and those
Ropes being often wet and dry (according to
their Nature) shrunk a little, and by that
means lift'd up the weight to its design'd
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52279:36"/>
Station, to the great Admiration and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause
of the Vulgar.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Constantinople,</hi> I saw several sorts of
wild Beasts, such as <hi>Lynxes, Catta-Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
Panthers, Leopards</hi> and <hi>Lyons;</hi> but they
were so gentle and tame, that I saw one of
the Keepers pull a <hi>Sheep</hi> out of a <hi>Lions</hi> Mouth,
so that he only moistned his Jaws with the
Blood without devouring him. I saw also a
young <hi>Elephant,</hi> so wanton, that he could
dance and play at Ball. Sure you cannot
chuse but laugh, when I tell you of an <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant</hi>'s
dancing and playing at Ball; but if I
should say no more, why may you not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me as well as <hi>Seneca,</hi> who tells us of One
that could dance upon the Rope? Or as <hi>Pliny,</hi>
who speaks of Another, that understood
<hi>Greek?</hi> But that you may not think me an
egregious Forger, give me leave to explain
my self: When this <hi>Elephant</hi> was bid to dance,
he did so caper or quaver with his whole
Body, and interchangeably move his Feet,
that he seem'd to represent a kind of a Jig;
and as for playing at Ball, he very prettily
took up the Ball in his Trunk, and sent it
packing therewith, as we do with the Palm of
the Hand: And if this be not to dance and
play at Ball, I know not what is.</p>
               <p>Among those wild Beasts, there had been
a <hi>Camelopardalis,</hi> but she died a little before I
came to <hi>Constantinople;</hi> however, I caus'd her
Bones, which had been buried in the Earth, to
be digg'd up, that I might inspect the <hi>make</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:52279:37"/>
of this Creature: It is an Animal a great deal
taller in the forepart than in the hinder; and,
for that Reason it is unfit to carry a Man, or
any other Burthen. It hath an Head and a
Neck like a <hi>Camel,</hi> but a spotted Skin like a
<hi>Lizard,</hi> and therefore it is called by a Name
deriv'd from both <hi>(i. e.) Camelopardalis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It might have been imputed as a piece of
great neglect in me not to have visited the
<hi>Euxin,</hi> especially, having opportunity to sale
thither; seeing the Ancients us'd to account
it as great a piece of Curiosity to see <hi>Pontus,</hi>
as to visit <hi>Corinth.</hi> Thither, therefore, I
sail'd with a prosperous Gale, and had the
Privilege to be admitted into some of the
Pleasure-houses of the <hi>Grand Seignior.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Valves of one of them, I beheld the
famous Fight of <hi>Selimus</hi> with <hi>Ishmael</hi> King of
the <hi>Persians,</hi> excellently described in Checker-work.
I had also the view of many of the
Orchards and Groves of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Emperor,
which were seated in most pleasant Vallies;
this I may say of them, That they ow'd little
to Art, but almost all to Nature: So that I
could not chuse but entertain such <hi>Epiphone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's</hi>
as these in my Thoughts, O most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
Houses for Nymphs! O choice Seats for
the Muses! O Retirements fit for the Learned!
To deal plainly with you (as I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
they seem'd to me, as it were, sensibly
to bewail their present Posture, and to cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud
to <hi>Christians</hi> for their better cultivation;
and not they only, but much more, <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:52279:37"/>
it self, yea, and all <hi>Greece</hi> too; which
being, heretofore, the most flourishing Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
in the World, is now wofully inslaved by
<hi>Barbarians;</hi> heretofore, it was the Mother
and Nurse of all good Arts and liberal Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but, now, alas! it seems to call for that
Culture and Humanity, which once it deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
down to us; and, by way of requital,
claims the Redemption of our Common Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
from that <hi>Scythian Barbarism,</hi> under
which it groans; and call it may long enough,
for, with Grief may we speak it, <hi>Christian</hi>
Princes, now a days, are otherwise imploy'd;
so that the <hi>Turks</hi> do not more domineer over
the poor <hi>Greeks,</hi> than Vices, such as Luxury,
Gluttony, Sloth, Lust, Pride, Ambition,
Avarice, Hatred, Envy and Emulation, do
reign over <hi>Christians;</hi> which do so clog, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nervate
and depress our Minds, that we can
hardly look up Heaven-ward; nor can we
so unmanacle our selves, as to aspire to any
thing, that is truly Great or Excellent.</p>
               <p>Methinks, Duty and Piety should have been
sufficient Motives to us, to help our afflicted
Brethren; but if we had been proof against
those Incentives, so that neither brave nor
praise-worthy Actions could unthaw our fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
Courage; yet Profit and Advantage,
which are now the great Byas of the World,
might have set us a Gog to recover such opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and commodious Countries from Infidels,
and to possess them our selves: But, on the
contrary, forsooth! we plow the <hi>Ocean,</hi> even
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52279:38"/>
as far as the <hi>Indies,</hi> and the very <hi>Antipodes,</hi>
because, there, we get rich Prey and Spoil at
a cheap rate, even without Bloodshed, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
on the simple and uncrafty <hi>Indians.</hi> 'Tis
true, we pretend the Conversion of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi>
but, if we go to the Root of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
(to our shame be it spoken) 'tis their
Gold, not their Godliness, is the Gain we
seek for. Our Ancestors carried it quite and
clean at another rate, who did not, like Huck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string
Merchants, seek after those Places
where there was most Wealth, but where
there was greater opportunity for Noble and
Vertuous Atchievments. So that, it was not
Profit, but Honour, which put them upon
hazardous and remote Expeditions: And when
they came home, they were more laden with
Glory than with Plunder. I speak this in
your Ear, for others, perhaps, may think it
a piaculiar thing in me, to detract from the
manners of the present Age. But, let them
think what they will, I see that the Arrow is
drawn to the Head, to destroy us; and, I am
afraid, that we, who would not fight for
Glory, shall be forc'd to do it to save our Lives.
But to return to <hi>Pontus.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> call the <hi>Euxin, Caradenis</hi> (i. e.)
<hi>The Black Sea,</hi> it falls down through narrow
Straits into the <hi>Thracian Bosphorus,</hi> where its
Waters are toss'd up and down by many Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices,
Turnings and Windings, occasion'd by
several Promontories jutting out into it; and
thus, in one days Passage, it descends to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52279:38"/>
                  <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and from thence, almost by
the like straight Passage, it breaks out into

                     </gap>opontis.</hi> In the middle of the Bay,
where it makes its Influx into the <hi>Bosphorus,</hi>
there is a Rock with an erected Pillar, in the
Basis whereof is writ the Name of a certain
<hi>Roman,</hi> called <hi>Octavian,</hi> (if my Memory fail
not) in <hi>Latin</hi> Letters.</p>
               <p>On the <hi>European</hi> Shore there is a Tower,
called, <hi>Pharos,</hi> where they hang out Lights,
in the Night, to guide Sailers by: Not far
from this place, a River falls into the Sea, in
the Chanel whereof there are found Stones,
little inferior to <hi>Onyxes</hi> or <hi>Sardonyxes,</hi> and,
if they be polish'd, are as shining as they. A
few Miles from that Bay, which I lately spake
of, we may see those Straits over which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
waft'd his Army against the <hi>European
Scythians:</hi> And about the middle between the
two Mouths of the <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> there are two
Castles, whereof one's in <hi>Europe,</hi> and the
other on the opposite Shore, in <hi>Asia.</hi> This
later was possess'd by the <hi>Turks,</hi> long before
<hi>Mahomet</hi> took <hi>Constantinople.</hi> The <hi>other</hi> was
built by him some few Years after he became
Master of that City. The <hi>Turks</hi> make use of
it, at this day, as a Prison for the nobler sort
of their Captives. <hi>Lazarus,</hi> a Commander,
or Prince of the <hi>Epitots,</hi> not long ago was
taken Prisoner by the <hi>Turks,</hi> together with
some <hi>Spaniards</hi> at <hi>Castlenovo,</hi> and committed
to this Tower; from whence making his
escape, and being retaken, he was Impal'd,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52279:39"/>
(<hi>i. e.</hi>) put to a most cruel Death, by having a
Pole thrust thro' his Body from his Fundament
to his very Neck; yet he indur'd it with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
Patience.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you expect that I should here give
you an Account of those Floating Islands,
called, <hi>Cyaneae</hi> or <hi>Symplegades:</hi> But to deal
freely with you, those few Hours that I spent
on the <hi>Pontus,</hi> I saw no such Islands at all;
whether they had been carried to any other
Place, I know not: If you desire to have a
more particular Information concerning them,
you may consult <hi>Peter Gyllius,</hi> who was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
Inquirer into such Curiosities; for my
Part, I shall record only what I saw or know
to be true. Yet I think it is not fit for me to
conceal a Mistake that <hi>Polybius</hi> is guilty of; for
he propounds many Arguments to prove,
That in tract of time the <hi>Euxin</hi> will be choakt
up with Sand and other Trash, which by the
<hi>Danow,</hi> the <hi>Borysthenes,</hi> and other great Rivers
falling into it, that it would be made unfit for
Navigation; whereas, the contrary appear'd
to me, for that Sea is every jot as navigable,
at this day, as it was of old in the days of
<hi>Polybius.</hi> And tho' he seem'd to have some
Grounds for his Opinion, that to him were
<hi>Irrefragable;</hi> yet time hath shewed them to be
<hi>Weak.</hi> The like observation holds in other
Cases; for, of old, who would not believe
the Ancients, who affirmed, upon seemingly
imaginable Grounds, That the Torrid Zone
was Inhabitable; whereas, later Discoveries
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52279:39"/>
have fully convinced us, That those hot
Countries are as well inhabited as any other
part of the Terrestial Globe; nay, when the
Sun <hi>is at the</hi> highest with them, and darts
down its Rays perpendicularly upon them;
even at that very time the Ardency of the Heat
is so tempered and cooled by continued Rains,
that those Countries are rendred very fit for
Human Habitations. But to return.</p>
               <p>After the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> was informed, by
Letters, of my Arrival, (as I said before) he
sent to the Governor of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating
his Pleasure, that he should send us to
him into <hi>Asia,</hi> as far as the City of <hi>Amasia,</hi>
or (as 'tis writ in ancient Coins) <hi>Amazeia,</hi>
where he then was. Upon this Advice we
prepared all things for our Journy; and,
with our Guides, on the 9<hi>
                     <hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                  </hi> of <hi>March</hi> we
were wafted over into <hi>Natolia,</hi> (for so the
<hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Asia</hi> at this day:) That day we
went no further than <hi>Scutari,</hi> a Town on the
<hi>Asiatick</hi> Shore, opposite to Old <hi>Byzantium;</hi>
where, or very little above it, the noble City
of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> was formerly thought to stand.
The <hi>Turks</hi> were of Opinion, That when our
Horses, Coaches, Baggage and Train, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with our selves, were all got over the
<hi>Hellespont,</hi> 'twas enough for one days Journy;
especially, considering, that if we had forgot
any of the necessary Accoutrements for our
Journy, or had left them behind at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
(as it sometimes happened) we might
bethink our selves before we went any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52279:40"/>
and fetch them over. The next day
we continu'd our Journy from <hi>Scutari,</hi> over
Fragrant Fields, full of odoriferous Plants, and
especially <hi>Stoechas's,</hi> a sweet smelling Spike:
There we saw a vast number of <hi>Tortoises,</hi> stalk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over all the Field, without any fear at all;
we had certainly seized upon a great many of
them, as a Prey grateful to our Palates, had
it not been for our <hi>Turkish</hi> Guides, whom we
were afraid to disoblige; for if they had seen
any of them brought to our Table, much
more, if they had touched them, they would
have thought themselves so de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>led, that I
know not how many Washings would not
have cleansed their imagined Pollution. For,
as I told you before, the <hi>Turks,</hi> and the <hi>Greeks</hi>
too, are so superstitious, that they abhor ever
to touch of that Animal; so that it being no
hurtful Creature, and no Body endeavouring
to catch them, the whole Country abounds
with <hi>Tortoises.</hi> I kept one of them, by me,
a great while, which had two Heads, and it
would have lived much longer if I had been
as careful of it as I might. That days Journy
brought us to a Village, called, <hi>Cartaly,</hi>
which I mention, because I shall, for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
gratify you with the knowledge of the
several Stages of this Voyage. For tho' the
Journy from <hi>Vienna</hi> to <hi>Constantinople</hi> hath been
performed by many, yet this from <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi>
to <hi>Amasia,</hi> hath, as yet, been undergone
by no <hi>Christian</hi> that I know of. From <hi>Cartaly</hi>
we came to <hi>Gebise,</hi> a Town of <hi>Bitheynia,</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:52279:40"/>
which some think was anciently called <hi>Lybissa,</hi>
and is famous for the Sepulchre of <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
who was there interred. From thence there is
a most pleasant Prospect into the Sea, and into
the Bay of <hi>Nicomedia;</hi> here also grow <hi>Cyprus</hi>
Trees of a wonderful Bulk and Tall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>Our<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> days Journy from <hi>Constantinople</hi>
brought us to <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> a City, anciently,
of great Note; but we saw nothing remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in it, but the Ruins and Rubbish of old
Walls, with some broken pieces of Pillars
with their Chapiters, which were all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
of its ancient Splendor, except one
Castle on an Hill, which was somewhat more
intire. A little before we came to this Place,
some Workmen, that were digging under
Ground, discovered a long Wall made with
Marble, which (it may be) was part of the
ancient Palace of the Kings of <hi>Bythynia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> we passed over a Cliff or
Ridge of Mount <hi>Olympiu,</hi> and came to a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
called, <hi>Kasockly,</hi> and from thence to
<hi>Nice;</hi> but 'twas so late before we came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that the first Watch was set. Not far
from that Place, I heard a mighty noise, as if
it had been of Men that jeer'd and mock'd us.
I asked, what was the Matter? Whether any
of the Mariners, rowing on the Lake <hi>Ascanius,</hi>
(which was not far off) did deride us, for
Travelling at that unusual time of Night? I
was answered, No, but it was only the howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of certain Beasts, which the <hi>Turks</hi> call
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52279:41"/>
                  <hi>Ciacals</hi> or <hi>Iacals.</hi> They are a sort of Wolves
somewhat bigger than Foxes, but less than
common Wolves, but as greedy and devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as the most ravenous Wolves or Foxes of
all. They go in Flocks, and seldom or never
hurt either Man or Beast, but get their Food
by Craft and Stealth more than by open Force.
Thence it is, that the <hi>Turks</hi> call subtle and
crafty Persons, especially, the <hi>Asiaticks,</hi> by
the Metaphorical Name of <hi>Ciacals.</hi> Their
manner is to enter into the Tents or Houses
of the <hi>Turks,</hi> in the Night-time, and what
they can catch, that is eatable, that they
eat; and if they find nothing else to devour,
then they fall a gnawing of all kinds of Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, as Shooes, Boots, Girdles, Scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards
of Swords, and the like; and they are
as cunning as they are thievish, but in this they
are very ridiculous, that they discover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by the noise they make. For whilst
they are most busie in an House, devouring
their Prey, if any one of their Herd, that
stays without doors, chance to howl, they all
set up a howling likewise; and, thus, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
where they are, they raise up the People
of the House, who leap out of their Beds, and
cudgel them soundly.</p>
               <p>All the next day we staid at <hi>Nice;</hi> I believe
my Lodging was in the same House where the
Council of <hi>Nice</hi> was heretofore celebrated.
As for the Town it self, it is seated on the
Bank of the Lake <hi>Ascanius.</hi> The Walls of it
are almost intire, so are the Gates, which are
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52279:41"/>
but four, and may all be seen from the middle
of the Market-place; in each of them there
were old Inscriptions, in <hi>Latin,</hi> which shew,
That the Town was repaired by <hi>Antoninus,</hi>
which of them I do not well remember; but
sure it must be by <hi>Antoninus</hi> the Emperor.
There are also some remainders of his Baths,
and whilst the <hi>Turks</hi> were digging out Stones
from thence to build Houses at <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
they found the Statue of a Soldier in his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
curiously wrought, and almost intire;
but they quickly batter'd it with their Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
even in our view; and when we shew'd
our selves displeased at their rude Violence,
they paid us with a jeer, <hi>What,</hi> said the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers,
<hi>will you bow down to worship this Statue,
as you</hi> Christians <hi>use to do to yours?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From <hi>Nice</hi> we continued our Journy to a
place, called, <hi>Ienysar.</hi> From <hi>Ienysar</hi> to <hi>Ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byuck,</hi>
from <hi>Ackbyuck</hi> to <hi>Bazargyck,</hi> from <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zargyck</hi>
to <hi>Bosowick,</hi> otherwise called, <hi>Cassum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassa,</hi>
seated in the narrowest Straits of
Mount <hi>Olympus;</hi> for almost all our way from
<hi>Nice,</hi> thither, lay through the Cliff of that
Mountain. At <hi>Nice</hi> we lodged in a <hi>Turkish</hi>
Inn or Hospital, and just against it was a Rock
standing on high Ground, wherein there was
a square deep Trench cut, and from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
thereof there issued out a Canal, that
reached to the High-way. That Trench or
Ditch, the ancient Inhabitants of that Place
used, in the Winter time, to fill with Snow;
that so the melted Snow-water gentlydrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52279:42"/>
down into the Road, by the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned

Travellers. Such Works as these the
<hi>Turks</hi> count <hi>Eleemosynary</hi> ones; because they
are for the publick Benefit and Advantage of
Mankind.</p>
               <p>Not far from this Place, on the right Hand,
we saw a Town, called, <hi>Otmanlick,</hi> borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its Name (as I conceive) from <hi>Ottoman,</hi>
the Founder of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family, who lived
there.</p>
               <p>From those Straits we descended into an
open Campaign; and when we came thither,
we lay the first Night in our Tents, whereby
the Heat did not so much incommode us, as
otherwise it would have done; the Place was
called <hi>Chiausada.</hi> The most remarkable things
we saw here, was a Subterraneous House, that
had no Light, but only what stole in at the
Roof: We saw, also, that sort of <hi>Goats</hi> of
whose Hair, or Fleece, (if you had rather call
it so) they make the Shagreen or watred Stuff,
called, <hi>Camlet;</hi> if you would know the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of that Creature, I shall not entertain
you with a Flam, but give you the true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
thereof.</p>
               <p>The Hair of this Creature is very fine, and
extreamly white, and it hangs down from
their Bodies to the Ground. The <hi>Goat</hi>-Herds
do not Sheer but Kemb it off, and 'tis, almost,
as fine as Silk. These <hi>Goats</hi> are often wash'd,
in the Neighbouring Rivers, and feed upon
the Grass growing there, which is very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52279:42"/>
and dry; and that certainly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
much to the fineness of their Wool;
for if they are remov'd to another Place,
their Fleece changes with their Pasture, and
their <hi>Kids</hi> do so degenerate, that one would
hardly think them of the same Breed. The
Thread that is spun of that Hair, or Wool,
is carry'd, by the Women of that Country,
to <hi>Ancyra,</hi> a City of <hi>Galatia,</hi> where it is wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
into Cloth and dyed, as I shall tell you
anon.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the Sheep of those Countries
have very fat and weighty Tails, (their Sheep-Flocks
consist hardly of any other;) the
Tail of any one of them weighs sometimes
three or four Pound, and sometimes eight or
ten; yea, they grow so big in some old Sheep,
that they are forc'd to lay them upon a Plank
running on two little Wheels, that so they
may draw them after them, not being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
able to trail them along.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you will think I tell you a Romance,
but take it on my word, it is a certain Truth.
I grant, such bulky Tails may be of some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
because they are full of Fat; but the
Flesh of the Sheep seem'd more harsh and
rank to me, than our own Mutton. The
Shepherds that tend them, lye Day and Night
in the Fields, and carry their Wives and
Children about with them, in Wagons, which
serve them instead of Houses; only, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
they erect small Tents, to lie under.
They wander far and near, sometimes in the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52279:43"/>
open Campaign, sometimes over Hills, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
over Dales, as the Season of the Year,
and the necessity of Pasturage, doth require.</p>
               <p>I saw also, in those Countries, some sort of
Birds, unknown to us, and such as I never
saw before; among the rest, there is a kind of
<hi>Ducks,</hi> which gives a sound like Trumpeters,
or such as blow the Cornet; the noise they
make is almost like the sound of a Post-boys
Horn. It is a Bird, which though it hath
nothing wherewith to defend it self, yet is
very strong and daring.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> are verily persuaded, that the
Devils are afraid of them. This is certain,
they are so tenaciously sensible of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
that though they have been kept up
tame in a Coop, for three Years together, yet if
they can but get an opportunity to escape a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
they fly to their wonted Haunts, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
their Natural Seats before their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
Prisons, though they be cramm'd and
fatned there.</p>
               <p>We pass'd on from <hi>Chiausada</hi> to <hi>Karali;</hi>
from <hi>Karali</hi> to <hi>Hazdengri;</hi> from thence to
<hi>Mazothoy;</hi> from <hi>Mazothoy</hi> we passed over the
River <hi>Sangac,</hi> which runs into <hi>Pontus</hi> out of
<hi>Phrygia,</hi> and came to <hi>Mahathli;</hi> from thence
to <hi>Zugli,</hi> thence to <hi>Chilancych;</hi> from <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancych</hi>
to <hi>Ialancych;</hi> from thence to <hi>Portuguin;</hi>
and from <hi>Portuguin</hi> we reached to <hi>Ancyra,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
by the <hi>Turks, Angur.</hi> We staid one
whole day at <hi>Ancyra,</hi> partly, because the
<hi>Turks</hi> did not hasten us, for in regard the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:52279:43"/>
Embassador made an Halt, we were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to do so too, that we might make our
Entrances, both at one time. into <hi>Amasia.</hi> I
saw nothing remarkable in all the Villages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned,
save that sometimes, among
the <hi>Turkish</hi> Sepulchres, we light upon some
Pillars, or ancient Stones of curious Marble,
wherein there were some Remains of <hi>Latin</hi> or
<hi>Greek</hi> Inscriptions, but so defaced, that they
could not be read; which Occurrent did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
me very much, for all my delight was,
assoon as I came to my Inn, at Night, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after old Inscriptions, together with
<hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Coins; and sometimes for
rare kinds of Plants.</p>
               <p>As for the Sepulchres, or Graves, of the
<hi>Turks,</hi> their Custom is not to fill them with
Earth, but throw great Stones upon them,
for a covering; would you know the reason?
'Tis Superstititious enough. The <hi>Turks</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that when the Devil (God bless us) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
the deceased, and calls upon him to give
an Account how he spent his Life; then his
good Genius will defend him, and this Stone,
forsooth, is the Place upon which the Ghost
must sit, that he may plead his Cause with
more care; and this Grave-stone is huge and
bulky, that so Dogs, Wolves or other Rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Beasts, especially, the <hi>Hyaena,</hi> may not
injure his Corps, as it lies in the Earth.
For,</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hyaena</hi> is a Beast, common in those
Countries; she uses to dig up Graves, and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52279:44"/>
taking out the dead Bodies from thence, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
them to her Den; near which you shall
see a great heap of Bones of Men, Horses
and other Creatures; she is a little lower than
a Wolf, but quite as long; she hath a Skin
like a Wolf, only her Hair is rougher and full
of great black Spots; her Head is contiguous
to her <hi>Spina dorsi,</hi> without any <hi>ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ebrae</hi> at all;
so that when she looks backward, she must of
necessity turn her whole Body: Instead of a
row of Teeth, she hath but one continued
Bone, as Reports go of her. The <hi>Turks</hi> do
ascribe great Vertue to this Beast, in <hi>Philtres,</hi>
as did the Ancients; and, whereas, there
were two of them at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> when I
was there, I cheapned them; but their Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
were unwilling to sell them, because they
kept them for the <hi>Sultanness (i. e.)</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's
Wife, who was thought by amatory
Potions and Magick Art, to have engaged
thereby her Husband's Love to her. Here I
cannot chuse but take notice of a Mistake, in
<hi>Bellonius,</hi> who thinks the <hi>Hyaena</hi> to be the same
Creature with that we call the <hi>Zibeth</hi> or
<hi>Musk cat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But seeing I am about describing the <hi>Hyaena,</hi>
I will tell you a Tale, which I am sure will make
you laugh, if ever you have laughed in your
Life; it is this.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> have a Tradition, that the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aena,</hi>
(which in their Language they call <hi>Zittlian</hi>)
understands what Men say one to another;
yea, the Ancients affirm'd, that they could
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52279:44"/>
also imitate Man's Voice, and thereupon Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
catch them by this Wile; they find out
her Den, which they may easily do by the
heap of Bones, lying by it, (as I said before)
and then one of them goes in with a Rope,
leaving the other end of the Rope in the Hands
of his Fellows without, and when he is creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in, he cries, with a loud Voice, ever and
anon, <hi>Ioctur, Ioctur, Vcala</hi> (i. e.) <hi>She is
not here, She is not here,</hi> or, <hi>I cannot find her;</hi>
whereupon, the <hi>Hyaena,</hi> thinking she is not
discovered, lies close, and he ties one end of
the Rope about his Leg; and then he goes
forth, still crying, <hi>I cannot find her;</hi> but when
he is escap'd quite out of the Hole, he cries
out aloud, <hi>She is within, She is within;</hi> which
the <hi>Hyaena</hi> hearing, and understanding the
meaning of it, (as they say) leaps out, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to escape; but then they hold her back
by the Rope tyed to her Leg, that they either
kill her, or, if they use care and diligence,
take her alive, for she is a fierce Creature, and
defends her self desperately: But enough,
if not too much, of the <hi>Hyaena.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I found abundance of old Coins all up and
down this Country, especially of the later Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Constantines,</hi> the <hi>Constantius's</hi>
the <hi>Iustin's,</hi> the <hi>Valens's,</hi> the <hi>Valentine's,</hi> the
<hi>Numerians,</hi> the <hi>Probus's,</hi> the <hi>Tacitus's,</hi> and
such like; in many Places the <hi>Turks</hi> use them
for Weight, <hi>viz.</hi> of a Drachm or half a
Drachm, and they call it <hi>Giaur Manguri</hi> (i. e.)
the Mony of the <hi>Pagans</hi> or <hi>Infidels.</hi> The like
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52279:45"/>
Coins I found in the neighbouring Cities of <hi>Asia,</hi>
as at <hi>Amysus,</hi> at <hi>Synopis,</hi> at <hi>Cumonme,</hi> at <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris</hi>
and <hi>Amasia</hi> it self, whither we were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
There was a Brasier of that City which
grieved me very much; for demanding of him,
Whether he had any old Coins to sell? He
answered me, That a few days ago, he had
a large Room full of them, but now he had
melted them down to make Brass-kettles, as
thinking them of little value, and fit for no
other use; when I heard this Story, it troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
me much to lose so many choice Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Antiquity; but I paid him back in
his own Coin, as the Proverb is, by telling
him, That I would have given him a hundred
Guilders for them; so that my Revenge was
suited to his Injury, for I sent him away as
sorrowful, for losing so full a Morsel out of
his Mouth, as he did me for losing the
Coins.</p>
               <p>As for Plants, I saw very few in my Journy
in those Parts, which were unknown to us in
<hi>Europe;</hi> they were almost all of the same kind,
only they were more or less flourishing, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Richness or Poverty of the
Soil. The <hi>Amomum,</hi> which <hi>Dioscorides</hi> says
grows near <hi>Pontus,</hi> I very diligently sought
for, but in vain, so that I knew not whether
that Plant did not fail in that Country, or
else was transplanted into another.</p>
               <p>This Town of <hi>Ancyra</hi> was our <hi>9th</hi> Stage
from <hi>Constantinople;</hi> it is a Town of <hi>Galatia,</hi>
sometimes the Seat of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> called, by
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52279:45"/>
                  <hi>Pliny, Tectosagum;</hi> nor was it unknown to
<hi>Strabo.</hi> Tho' perhaps the present Town is
but part of the old Town, called, in the
Canons, <hi>Anguira.</hi> Here we saw a stately
Superscription, and a Sampler of those Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
wherein the Atchievments of <hi>Augustus,</hi>
were summarily comprehended. I caused as
much of it, as we could read, to be transcribed.
It is cut in the Marble Walls of that Structure,
which heretofore was the Town-hall, but is now
demolished, so that one part of it is visible
to those that enter on the right Hand, and
the other to those that enter upon the left.
The top Chapiters are almost entire; the
middle is full of Clefts, and the lowermost
part of it is so battered with Clubs and Hatches,
that it cannot be read; which Loss cannot be
sufficiently lamented by all Lovers of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and so much the more, because the
Commons of <hi>Asia,</hi> dedicated this City to
<hi>Augustus.</hi> Here also we were Eye-witnesses
of the dying of that Cloth, I spake of before,
made of Goats-wool, and how they Camlet
it, or give it its Water-colour, 'tis done thus.
They pour Water upon it, and by means
of a Cloth-press, cause it to receive that
Colour. That is counted the best, which
is most variegated in every part; and if in any
piece, the Water-colours do not deeply and
uniformly appear, that piece, tho' of the same
Colour and made of the same Wool, is valued
at some Gilders less than another, because
it is not so deeply tinctured. The better sort
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52279:46"/>
of <hi>Turks,</hi> in their old Age, are usually clothed
with this sort of Cloth, and <hi>Solyman</hi> himself
used to wear Vests of it; but Green is a Colour
disused much by <hi>Christians;</hi> and the rather,
because the <hi>Turks</hi> commend it upon a supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Account, as being worn by their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Mahomet</hi> in his older days.</p>
               <p>A black Colour is counted unfortunate, and
is dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ik'd by them; and when they see any
Man so clad, they look on it as an ill <hi>Omen;</hi> so
that when any of Ours did approach the <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa's,</hi>
in a black Habit, they look'd asquint on
us, and made sad Complaints; and the truth
is, none of their own appear in black, but
either one that is desperately poor, or else
so overwhelm'd with some great calamity,
that he regards not what Cloths he wears.
A Purple Colour is a creditable Colour with
them, only it is an Omen of much Bloodshed
in time of War: But the ordinary approved
Colours among them, are the <hi>White,</hi> the <hi>Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi>
the <hi>Sea-green,</hi> the <hi>Violet-colour</hi> and <hi>Mouse-colour,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> ascribe very much to <hi>Augury,</hi>
and <hi>Omens,</hi> Good or Bad, so that it hath been
known, that some <hi>Bassa's</hi> have been remov'd
from their Places and Offices, by reason of a
fall from their Horse, as if that were an <hi>Omen</hi>
of some ill luck, which is averted from the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
by falling on the Head of that private
and particular Person, who is thereupon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:52279:46"/>
From <hi>Ancyra,</hi> we came to a Village, called,
<hi>Balygazar;</hi> and from thence to <hi>Zarekneth;</hi> from
<hi>Zarckneth</hi> to <hi>Zetmetzii,</hi> and to the Bank of the
River <hi>Halys:</hi> As we past through a Village,
called, <hi>Algii,</hi> we saw, at some distance, the
neighbouring Mountains of <hi>Synopi,</hi> which were
red, like Vermillion, and from which red
Lead is called <hi>Synopi'.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Halys</hi> is the famous River, which was
heretofore the Boundary of the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
of the <hi>Medes,</hi> and <hi>Lydians,</hi> concerning
which there was an ancient Oracle, That when
<hi>Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sus</hi> pass'd it, to make War on the <hi>Persians,</hi>
he should overthrow a great Empire, which
fell out to be his <hi>Own,</hi> whereas he thought it
would have been the <hi>Persians:</hi> Near the Bank
of this River there was a Wood, which seem'd,
to us, to bear an unknown Shrub; but when
we drew near, we found it to be <hi>Liquorice,</hi>
and with the Juice of its Root, we refresh'd
our selves abundantly.</p>
               <p>Near that River we met with a Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and asking him, by an Interpreter,
Whether that River did abound with Fish?
And how they used to catch them? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
That there were Fishes enough, but no
Body could catch them. When he saw we
wondred at his Answer, he proceeded: For,
<hi>says he,</hi> if a Man strive to take them up in his
Hands, away presently they swim, and will
not stay to be catched. This Answer was the
less surprizing to me, because, when we had
lighted upon some unknown Birds, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52279:47"/>
of the Country-men, <hi>how we might take
them?</hi> One or other of them told us, That they
could not be taken; for if any Body endeavoured
to lay Hands on them, they would fly away.</p>
               <p>But one of my Collegues, <hi>Francis Hay,</hi>
having some Nets with him, caused them to
be cast for the catching of Fish; we took a
great Draught of them, and especially the
<hi>Silurus,</hi> or <hi>Shetefish,</hi> which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in the <hi>Danow.</hi> Besides, there is in that
River, good store of Sea-crabs, or else a sort
of Fish very like them. Whereupon the
<hi>Turks,</hi> who saw our Fishing, wondred at the
Industry and Ingenuity of <hi>Christians,</hi> who
would catch Fish at that rate. Hereupon,
perhaps, you will say, What, are there no
Fishermen in <hi>Turky?</hi> Which I grant there are,
but very few of them live in those Parts.
And, I remember, in another Place, when
the <hi>Turks</hi> saw us turn the Stream out of its
course to catch Gudgeons at the bottom, they
laughed us to pieces. <hi>What,</hi> said they, <hi>do you
catch such small guddling Fish? What are they
good for?</hi> This Ninny-Hammer did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that a great many of those Fishes
would make a dainty Dish, enough to suffice
many Guests. But the <hi>Turks</hi> are so parsimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious,
that they don't study their Bellies at
all; give them but Bread and Garlick, or an
Onion, with a sort of <hi>Bonniclabber,</hi> or four
Milk, known, in <hi>Galen</hi>'s time, by the name
of <hi>Syllabub,</hi> but called by them, <hi>Ingurthe,</hi>
they feed like Farmers, and desire nothing more.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:52279:47"/>
They make this Drink, thus; they dilute
this Milk with cold Water, and then cram
Bread into it; this they use in the hottest
Weather, and when they are more athirst;
and we ourselves found great Benefit by it,
in our greatest Droughts. It is a Repast very
grateful to the Palate and Stomach, and it is
of admirable Vertue in quenching the most
vehement Thirst. There is abundance of it
already made for Sale in all the <hi>Turkish</hi> Inns or
<hi>Caravasaras,</hi> as well as all other sorts of Soop.
As for hot Meat, or Flesh, the <hi>Turks</hi> don't
much use them in their Travels; their usual
Dyet, on the Road, are <hi>Syllabubs, Cheese,
dry'd Plums, Pears, Peaches, Quinces, Figs,
Raisins</hi> and <hi>Cornel-berries;</hi> all those are exposed
to Sale in great earthen Platters boyl'd in
clean Water; every one takes what he likes
best. Those Fruits, with Bread, is his Food; and
the Water, which remains, serves for Drink.
Thus their Meat and Drink stand them in
very little, so that I dare say, one <hi>Christian</hi>
spends more Mony; on his Belly, in one day,
than a <hi>Turk</hi> doth in twelve; yea, their most
solemn Feasts consist of <hi>Wafers, Cakes</hi> and such
like Junkets, together with several Dishes of
<hi>Rice,</hi> with some <hi>Mutton</hi> and <hi>Pullet;</hi> for <hi>Capons</hi>
are not yet known in <hi>Turky;</hi> but as for
<hi>Pheasants, Thrushes,</hi> and Birds called <hi>Figcaters,</hi>
they never so much as heard of their Names.
But if <hi>Hony</hi> and <hi>Sugar</hi> be mix'd with the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the Drink is like <hi>Ioves Nectar</hi> to them.
One sort of their Liquors I had almost forgot,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52279:48"/>
'tis this. They take <hi>Raisins</hi> of the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n,</hi> and
bruise or grind them in a Mill, and then put
them into a wooden Vessel, pouring a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
proportion of hot Water upon them.
This Mixture they stir about a little, and
then cover the Vessel close, and suffer it to
ferment a day or two; if it doth work well,
then they add Lees of Wine to quicken the
Operation. When it first begins to ferment,
if you taste it, 'tis over-sweet, and that
makes it more unrelishable; but afterwards
it acquires something of an Acid Tast, which,
mixt with the Sweet, is very grateful to the
Palate for about three or four days, especially,
if it be mixed with Snow, of which there is
plenty at <hi>Constantinople</hi> at all times. This
Drink they call <hi>Arabsorbet</hi> (i. e.) the <hi>Arabian
Potion,</hi> but it will not keep long, but grows
sour in a very little time. 'Twill fly up in
your Head, and make you reel as bad as any
Wine, if you drink too much of it; and,
therefore, the <hi>Turks,</hi> by the Rules of their
Religion, are for bidden to drink it. For my
part I liked it very well; yea, that sort of
Grapes were very acceptable and refreshing;
in many Places they keep them all Summer
long. The way of preserving them, they
told me, was this: They take large Bunches
of Grapes ston'd (as the hot Sun quickly ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
them in those Countries) these they put
in a Wooden or Earthen Vessel, in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
whereof they, first lay a line of groun'd
Mustard-seed, then they spread a line of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52279:48"/>
Grapes upon it; thus with a lay of Grapes,
and a lay of grinded Mustard-seed, they fill it
up to the top, and when the Vessel is full, then
they pour in new <hi>Must,</hi> as much as will fill
all the Interstice, then they shut it close, and so
let it stand till the hot time of the next Year,
when Men stand most in need of Drink. Then
these Vessels are broach'd, and the Grapes,
with its Liquor, are set to sale. The <hi>Turks</hi>
like the Liquor as well as the Grapes, but I
did not so well like the Tast of the Mustard-seed,
and, therefore I caused the Grapes to
be washed, and then when I was most thirsty,
they gave me great Relief. I hope you will
give me leave to commend a Food to you,
that did me so much good, seeing the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
(though preposterously) esteem'd their
Herbs and Plants, which were contributory to
their Health, as so many <hi>Deities.</hi> But 'tis
time for a Wanderer to return back into the
Way.</p>
               <p>From the Bank of the River <hi>Halys,</hi> which
(as I remember) the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Aitoczu,</hi> we
came to <hi>Gonknrthoy;</hi> from thence to <hi>Choron,</hi>
and from thence to <hi>Theche Theoi,</hi> where the
<hi>Turks</hi> have a stately Monastry for their <hi>Priests</hi>
and <hi>Monks,</hi> call'd, <hi>Dervises.</hi> These <hi>Dervises</hi>
told us a great Story of a certain Man, called,
<hi>Chederles,</hi> of an huge Stature, and Graveness
of Mind answerable thereto. They suppose it
was the same with our St. <hi>George,</hi> and ascribe
the same Exploits to him; as the saving of a
Virgin, by the Slaughter of a huge and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52279:49"/>
                  <hi>Dragon,</hi> To which they add many Fables
and Imaginations of idle Brains; as that he
Travelled over several Countries far and near,
and at last came to a River, whose Waters
made those that drank them, <hi>Immortal;</hi> but in
what part of the World this River is,
they cannot tell us; in some <hi>Vtopia</hi> doubtless!
They say, moreover, that it lies somewhere
in a great Cloud or Mist of Darkness, and
that never a Man saw it since <hi>Cherderles.</hi> As
for <hi>Cherderles</hi> himself, he was made Immortal,
and so was his Horse, or stately Prancer on
which he rides, by drinking the same Water,
who now, both, do invisibly travel over the
World, delighting in Wars, and appearing
therein to the most Valiant, or to those who
implore his Aid, of what Religion soever
they be: Such ridiculous Fancies do they please
themselves with. To which we may add
other things as absurd as those before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
That he was one of the Friends and
Companions of <hi>Alexander the Great.</hi> For the
truth is, the <hi>Turks</hi> keep no just Account either
of Times or Ages, but make a confus'd
Hodg-podg of all History. When they have
a mind to it, they scruple not to say, <hi>That</hi>
Job <hi>was Master of the Horse to King</hi> Solomon,
<hi>and that</hi> Alexander the Great <hi>was General of his
Army;</hi> with such-like Stuff.</p>
               <p>In that Monastry or <hi>Mosch,</hi> (for so the
<hi>Turks</hi> call their Temples and Churches) there
is a Fountain that bubbles forth very clear
and limpid Water, it is built about and clad
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52279:49"/>
with most excellent Marble, and they ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
would have people believe, that it had
its Original from <hi>Chederle</hi>'s Horse, which he
pissed in great plenty in that place. They
also told us many <hi>Rod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mantad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>'s</hi> concerning
the Companions of <hi>Chederles,</hi> concerning his
chief Groom, and also concerning his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
by his <hi>Sister;</hi> all which were buried near
at hand, and their Sepulchers there to be
seen, and when any <hi>Suppliants</hi> come to pay
their Devotions to them, they would have
persuaded us, that they received great Relief
thereby; yea, they superstitiously affirm,
That the Fragments of the Stones, and the
very Earth it self, on which <hi>Chederle</hi>'s Feet
stood, when he staid for the <hi>Dragon,</hi> if drank
in any Liquor, are very good against Fevers,
against the Head-ach, and against the Diseases
of the Eyes. All the Country, thereabouts,
is full of <hi>Dragons</hi> and <hi>Vipers,</hi> so that in the
hot Season of the Year, they are so thick,
basking themselves in the Sun, that the Ways
are almost unpassable for Travellers.</p>
               <p>I had almost forgot to tell you, that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
the <hi>Greeks</hi> do usually paint St. <hi>George</hi> on
Horse-back, in their Temples, with his
Squire behind him, holding out to him a Cup
of Wine as to his Master, he being (as they
believe) their <hi>Chederles;</hi> they laugh heartily
at that Spectacle.</p>
               <p>At this Place we were near our Journies
end, for now we had but one Stage more to
<hi>Amasia,</hi> and that was <hi>Baglison;</hi> from thence
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52279:50"/>
we reach'd <hi>Amasia, April</hi> 7; and thirty days
after we left <hi>Constantinople;</hi> as we were come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
some <hi>Turks</hi> met us, to gratulate our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival,
and to introduce us with Honour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amasia</hi> is, in a manner, the chief City of
<hi>Cappadocia,</hi> where the <hi>Turkish</hi> Governor of that
Province usually had his Residence, for the
administration of Justice, and where he usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
forms his Camp. But that Town, ever
since <hi>Bajazet's</hi> time, seem'd to be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky,
and of late the miserable case of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stapha,</hi>
hath confirm'd it to be an unfortunate
Seat. <hi>Strabo</hi> writes, that he was born there.
It lies on the side of two opposite Hills, the
River <hi>Ilis</hi> dividing the City in the midst,
running between them; so that from each
part you may look stoopingly into the River,
as from the Seats or Stairs of a Theatre; and
one side of it is conspicuous and open to the
view of the other. It is so encompassed with
Hills, that there is but one way to it either
for Coach or Wagon.</p>
               <p>The same Night we came thither, there
hapned a great Fire, which the <hi>Ianizaries</hi>
quenched, as their manner is, by plucking
down the Houses adjoyning. Upon occasion
of this Accident, give me leave to inform,
That the <hi>Turkish</hi> Soldiers are well-pleased
when a Fire happens; for, whereas, they
must be employed to quench it, and usually
doing it by the ruining the contiguous Houses,
they have thereby opportunity to rifle and
plunder both; so that they, themselves, do
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52279:50"/>
oftentimes privily set Houses on Fire, that so
they may pinch and steal what they can out
of them; as I remember once, when I was
at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> there were frequent Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grations
of Houses. 'Twas plain, they could
not happen casually, but must be set on fire a
purpose, and yet the Authors could not be
found; but the Fault was commonly cast on
some <hi>Persian</hi> Spyes that were in Town: At
last, upon a diligent search, 'twas found that
the Soldiers had stirr'd up their Fellows, that
were a Ship-board, to do the Feat; that so,
during the Fire, they might enrich themselves
with the Spoils.</p>
               <p>Upon an high Hill, that hangs over and
commands <hi>Amasia,</hi> there is a strong Castle,
wherein the <hi>Turks</hi> have a continual Garison,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>her to curb the <hi>Asiaticks,</hi> who are not very well
pleased with the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Yoke (as I shall shew
anon) or else to bridle the <hi>Persian,</hi> who many
times make large Excursions even as far as
this Town, tho' at such a vast distance from
them. In this Hill there are some ancient
Monuments, which, perhaps, were the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres
of the <hi>Cappadocian</hi> Kings.</p>
               <p>As for the Houses and Streets of <hi>Amasia,</hi>
there is little or no beauty in them. Their
Houses are built of Loom, as they are in
<hi>Spain,</hi> plain at top without any roof, and
what covering they have is of Loom or Clay
too. They have some old piece of a Pillar,
Cylinder or Rober, which they turn up and
down to stop any Chink or Crevice, made
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52279:51"/>
either by Rain or Wind. The Inhabitants;
in former times, lay down to sleep in the
open Air; as for Rains, they are not great
nor frequent in those Parts; but if at any
time a Shower falls, the Loomy Droppings
from the Eaves, do wofully dirty the Cloths
of those that pass under them. I saw there a
certain young noble Person, living not far
from me, at his Supper, after the old
<hi>Roman</hi> fashion, lying on a Bed. Assoon as
I came to <hi>Amasia,</hi> we were introduced to
complement the Supreme Vizier <hi>Achmet,</hi> and
the rest of the <hi>Bassa's,</hi> for their Emperor was
then gone abroad; we treated with them a
while concerning the Contents of our Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy;
and because they would not seem to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
us, they lent us a favourable Ear; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
referring all to the Will and Pleasure of
their Emperor. When he came home, we
were led into his Presence, for Audience;
but he entertain'd us (and the Reasons we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
in the Speech we made him, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Command of my Master) with a
sour and frowning Look. He sate upon a
low Throne, not above a Foot from the
Ground, but it was all covered over with
rich Tapestry, and with Cushions exquisitely
wrought. His Bow and Arrows lay by his
side, he himself (as I said) looked froward
upon us; and yet there was a certain Majesty,
mix'd with Severity, in his Countenance.
Each of us, as we entred the Room, were led
up towards him by some of his Bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-officers,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52279:51"/>
who held us by the Arm, (for so
they use to introduce Embassadors, ever since
a certain <hi>Croatian,</hi> desiring to speak with
<hi>Amurath,</hi> and drawing near to him so to do,
slew him in revenge of the death of his Master,
<hi>Mark,</hi> the <hi>Despot</hi> of <hi>Servia,</hi> who was killed
by the said <hi>Amurath):</hi> and afterwards, as if
we had kiss'd his Hand, we were led back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to the opposite part of the Room; for
the <hi>Turks</hi> count it an unmannerly thing to
turn any of ones Back parts to their Prince.
From thence I had liberty to declare our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's
Commands; but they suited not with
his lofty, imperious Spirit, who thought that
nothing ought to be denyed him, for they
were daring and high; so that he, as disdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, said nothing but <hi>Giusel, Ginsel;</hi>
(i. e.) <hi>Well, Well.</hi> And so we were dismissed
to our Lodgings.</p>
               <p>At our Audience there was a very full
Court, for a great many Governours of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
were there with their Presents; and,
besides, the Imperial Horse, <hi>Spahi's, Ianipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis</hi>
and <hi>Vlulags,</hi> there were also a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>Ianizaries.</hi> But among this vast num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Courtiers, there was not so much as
one more eminent for Birth or Parentage;
each one, by his Valour and adventrous At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements,
was the Carver out of his own
Fortune. Their Honour ariseth from their
Preferments, so that there is no dispute about
Precedency, but every Man's pre-eminces is
according to the Office which he bears. And
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:52279:52"/>
those Offices are distributed at the meer Will
and Pleasure of the Prince, who do's not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the empty Name of Nobility, nor value
a Rush the Favour of the Multitude, or of
any other particular Man, but considering on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Merits and Disposition of the Man, he
rewards him accordingly. And by that
means, Employments are bestowed upon such
Persons as are best able to manage them; and
every Man hath opportunity to be the Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merer
out of his own Honour and Preferment.
Those which at present are the greatest Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
under their Emperor, were mostly the
Sons of Shepherds or Neatherds; and they
are so far from being ashamed of the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their Original, that they glory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
among one another; and account it more
Praise-worthy to be the Advancers of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
than if they had Honour transmitted
down to them from their Ancestors.</p>
               <p>For thus they argue, Virtue is not propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from our Parents, but is partly the Gift
of God, and partly acquired by good Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
and by our own Labour and Industry;
so that as no Son hath his Fathers Skill in Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
Arithmetick or Geometry, derived to
him from his Birth, so neither can Fathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath
Virtue as an Inheritance to their Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren;
for the Soul (say they) is not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
with the Fathers Seed; so that a Son
must necessarily be born like qualified as his
Father was; but it is infus'd nto his Body
from the God of Heaven. Thus in that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52279:52"/>
Dignities, Honours, Offices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are
the Rewards of Vertue and Merit; as on the
other side, Improbity, Sloth, Idleness, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them the despicablest things in the
whole World. And by this means they
flourish, bear sway, and enlarge the Bounds
of their Empire every day more and more.
But we, <hi>Christians,</hi> to our shame be it spoken,
live at another manner of rate; Virtue is
little esteemed among us, but Nobleness of
Birth (forsooth) carries away all the Honour
and Preferment. But enough of this at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
more may be spoken on this Argument
hereafter; and what I have now spoken about
it, pray keep it to your self, for other Men
may not be able to bear my Freedom
herein.</p>
               <p>To return then to my Subject; I shall now
present you with a surprizing Spectacle, even a
Multitude of Persons with pick'd Turbants
on their Heads, made of pure white Linen
folded together in Plates; their other Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
was very costly of several sorts and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
all most radiantly shining with Gold,
Silver, Purple, Silk, Velvet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I am not
able to describe the Gaudiness of the <hi>Show;</hi>
in one word, 'twas the most glorious one I
ever saw in all my Life. And yet in all this
Splendor, there was a great deal of Simplicity
and Parsimony too. Those who were of one
Order had cloathing all of one sort; there
were no foolish Hems, Lacings, Fringes or
Borders, as among us, which cost a great
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52279:53"/>
deal of Mony, and yet wear out in a day or
two. The Silk and Velvet Suits, which many
of them wore, though mightily embroidered,
yet cost not above a Ducat the making and
embroidering. They did as much admire to
see the fashion of our Cloths, as we did that
of theirs. Their Vests are very long, almost
down to their Heels, which is more graceful,
and makes them seem taller than they are;
but our Apparel (forsooth) is so curtail'd and
short, that it hardly covers the Parts which
Nature would have to be concealed; on which
Account it is less decent. Besides, it seems to
take away some Inches from the talness of our
Stature, and look more <hi>Dwarf-like.</hi> And yet
among so great a Multitude, I took notice of
this most laudable Circumstance; 'twas all
<hi>hush,</hi> not so much as a word spoke among
them all, nor no humming noise, as among
a tumultuous Multitude; no justling one of
another, but every particular Man quietly
kept his own Station. The Heads of them,
which they call <hi>Aga's,</hi> had Seats to sit upon,
such as their <hi>Serasquiers,</hi> or <hi>Generals,</hi> their
<hi>Brigadiers, Colonels</hi> and <hi>Captains,</hi> but the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty
stood on their Feet: Among the rest,
I most admir'd the <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> though there
were some Thousands of them, yet they stood
at a distance one from another Stock-still, (as
we say) as if they had been Statues. So that
I who was at some distance from them,
thought verily they had been so, till being
advised to salute them, as the manner is, I saw
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52279:53"/>
them all bow their Heads, by way of Resalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
unto me. When we passed from this
Show, behold there was another pleasurable
one, which entertain'd us, and that was their
Horse-Guards, in their March to their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
they Rode upon gallant stately Prancers,
excellently well Trapp'd, Equipp'd, and
Shod. Thus we were dismissed, but with
little hopes of obtaining what we came for.</p>
               <p>On the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> the <hi>Persian</hi> Embassador
came to <hi>Amasia,</hi> and brought with him rich
and gallant Presents, as many choice sorts of
Hangings, <hi>Babylonian</hi>-Tents, curiously wrought
within with many sorts of Needle-work, gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
Horse-Trappings, and Saddles, Scymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
made at <hi>Damascus,</hi> whose Handles were
studded with Jewels, and Shields of curious
Workmanship; but that which exceeded them
all, was the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> so they call the Book
containing the Rites and Ceremonies of their
Religion, which they fancy <hi>Mahomet</hi> compos'd
by Divine Inspiration, and which is accounted
the most Noble Present of all. They quickly
accorded with him on Terms of Peace, so
that it concern'd us to be cautious, who were
to find greater obstruction in our Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with them. And to assure us that the
Peace was confirm'd betwixt them, they omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
no manner of extraordinary Respect to
their Embassador. For the guise of the <hi>Turks</hi>
is, (as I told you before,) to be excessive on
both sides, either in bestowing Honour on
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52279:54"/>
their Friends, or in heaping Reproaches on
their Enemies. <hi>Haly</hi> Bassa, Deputy to the
<hi>Grand Vizier,</hi> treated the <hi>Persian</hi> with a sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Dinner, which he made in his Garden,
a place far distant from us, and separated also
by the interposal of the River, yet we could
see the Manner of it well enough; for, I told
you, the place was seated so steep on both
sides the Hill, that the Eye might easily disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
what was done on each side. This <hi>Haly</hi>
is a <hi>Dalmatian</hi> by Birth, a Man of a good Wit,
and, which is strange in <hi>Turky,</hi> very courteous
to Strangers. The Table, at which the <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa</hi>
and the <hi>Persian</hi> Embassador sate, was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
over with a Canopy, and the Dishes
were served up after this manner: There
were One Hundred Youths, which attended,
like Waiters, all of them alike habited; first
of all, they entred one by one, at a small di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from one another, till the Train of
them reached up to the Table where the Guests
were a sitting; they had nothing at all in
their Hands, that so they might not be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
in saluting the Guests, which was done
in this manner; They laid their Hands on
their Thighs, and bowed their Heads down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to the ground; when this Ceremony
was perform'd, then he that stood next the
Kitchin, took a Dish and gave it to the next
Page immediately before him, he handed it to
a Third, and he to a Fourth, and so from one
to another till it came to him who stood next
the Table and he delivered it to the Hands
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52279:54"/>
of the Gentleman Sewer, who plac'd it on
the Table. And thus One Hundred Dishes,
or more, were serv'd up to the Table in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Order, without any Noise at all; and
when that was done, then those Waiters, or
Pages, saluted the Guests a second time, and
so returned in the same Order they came in;
only, of course, those that were last before
went out first, and those which were nearest
the Table brought up the Rear. Thus the
Second Course was also serv'd up, so that the
<hi>Turks</hi> are great Admirers of Order, even in
the smallest matters, which we <hi>Christians</hi> are
apt to neglect, even in things of greatest Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
At some distance from the Embassador
sate his Attendants with some <hi>Turks</hi> of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
with them.</p>
               <p>Peace being thus made with the <hi>Persians,</hi> as
I told you before, yet we could get no good
Terms of them at all, only we obtain'd an
Half-Years Truce, till I could send to my
Master, and know his Answer. I was sent to
be <hi>Leiger</hi> Embassador there, but in regard
there was no Peace settl'd betwixt both Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires,
the <hi>Bassa's</hi> thought it advisable for me
to return to my Master with Letters from <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman</hi>
their Emperor, and I was to return with
an Answer from his Imperial Majesty, if he
thought fit. Hereupon I was again intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
into <hi>Solyman</hi>'s Presence, and had Two
large Embroider'd Vests, reaching down to
my Ancles, clapt upon me; they were so hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
that I could hardly stand under them;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52279:55"/>
my Family also, that attended me, were all
Clad with Silk Garments of divers Colours;
in this posture I stalked along, like <hi>Agamem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
or some such piece of Gravity, in the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedian,</hi>
and so I took my leave of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
having first receiv'd Letters to my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
Seal'd and wrapt up in Cloth of Gold,
and the chiefest of my Attendants were also
admitted to take their Leaves; and thus after
we had taken our leaves of the <hi>Bassa</hi>'s, I and
my Collegues departed from <hi>Amasia, Iune</hi> the
<hi>2d.</hi> The Custom is, That Embassadors at
their departure have a Dinner provided for
them in the <hi>Divan,</hi> (so they call the place
where the <hi>Bassa</hi>'s sit to Administer Justice,)
but this is done only to their Friends; that
Complement was omitted to me, because Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
were not yet in an Amicable posture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them and us.</p>
               <p>If you Ask me, What manner of Man <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman</hi>
was? I'le tell you, He was an Ancient
Man, his Countenance, and the Mean of his
Body, was very Majestick, well becoming the
Dignity which he bore; he was Frugal and
Temperate, even from his Youth, tho' he
might have taken a greater liberty to himself
by the Rules of their own Religion. In his
Younger Days he was not given to Wine, nor
to Masculine Venery, which the <hi>Turks</hi> much
delight in, so that his very Enemies could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
nothing against him on those accounts;
but that he was too Uxurious, and his over-Indulgence
to his Wife made him give way to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52279:55"/>
the Death of his Son <hi>Mustapha,</hi> yet that Crime
was vulgarly imputed to that Ascendent she
had over him, by reason of her Inchantments
and Amatory Portions. This is certain, that
after he once took her for his lawful Wife, he
never had Carnal Knowledge of any other
Women, tho' their Laws did not forbid him.
He is a very strict Observer of the <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
Religion, and is as desirous to propagate
<hi>That,</hi> as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to enlarge the Bounds of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
               <p>He is now Sixty Years of Age; and, for a
Man of his Years, he enjoys a moderate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of Health, and yet his Countenance
doth discover, that he carries about him some
hidden Disease, 'tis thought a Gangrene, or
Ulcer, in the Thigh; yet at solemn Audien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Embassadors, he hath a <hi>Fucus</hi> to paint
his Cheeks, that he may appear sound and
healthy to them, and thereupon be more
dreaded by Foreign Princes, their Masters.
Methought I discovered some such thing at my
Dismission, for his Countenance was as foure
when I left him, as it was at my first Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>Having thus taken my leave, I began my
Journy in the Hot Month of <hi>june,</hi> and the
Heat thereof was so excessive, that it cast me
into a Fever; 'tis true, it was a remiss and
gentle one, yet it came every Day, to which
was added an Hoarsness, and Defluction of
Rheum from the Head, and it held me till I
came quite to <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:52279:56"/>
The <hi>Persian</hi> Embassador left <hi>Amasia</hi> the self-same
Day that I did, and we went both out
of the City the same way; for, (as I told
you before,) there is but one Passage into,
or out of, that Town, it is so shut in by the
circumjacent and unpassable Hills: But the
Way quickly doth divide into Two, one
to the <hi>East,</hi> which the <hi>Persians</hi> took; and
another to the <hi>West,</hi> which was our Road.
In the open Fields, about the Town, we saw
the <hi>Turkish</hi> Camp pitch'd, with abundance of
Tents. I shall not entertain you with the
Stages of my return, they being the same
with those of my Journy thither, only we
made a little more speed, and sometimes
Rode Two Days Journy in One. In fine,
we came to a <hi>Constantinople, Iune</hi> the 24<hi>th.</hi> You
must needs think I had a troublesome Journy
of it, having such a Companion with me, as
a <hi>Quotidian Ague,</hi> all the way; so that when
I came thither, I was almost nothing but Skin
and Bone: Yet, as Lean as I was, when I
came to rest, and, by the Advice of <hi>Quaquel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben,</hi>
my Physician, used warm Baths, I quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
recovered: One thing I observed in the
method of my Cure, that when I came out of
the warm Bath, he would sprinkle me over
with cold Water, which, tho' it were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
to me at the present, yet I found that
it did me much good.</p>
               <p>Whilst I staid at <hi>Constantinpole,</hi> there was a
certain Person, that came from the <hi>Turkish</hi>
Camp in <hi>Asia,</hi> who told me a Story, that I
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52279:56"/>
shall acquaint you with, because it shews, that
the <hi>Asiaticks</hi> are not very well pleased, either
with the Religion, or the Government, of
the <hi>Turks;</hi> 'twas this, <hi>Solyman,</hi> says he, as he
was returning Home, was forc'd to Lodg one
Night in the House of a certain <hi>Asiatick</hi> and
when he went away in the Morning, his Host
brought a great deal of Perfume, and us'd a
great deal of Ceremonies, to cleanse and
purge his House, as if it had been polluted
by such a Guest, as <hi>Solyman;</hi> when <hi>Solyman</hi>
heard of it, he caused the Man to be Slain,
and his House to be levelled with the ground.
This Punishment the poor Man underwent for
his Aversion from the <hi>Turks,</hi> and his Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
to favour the <hi>Persians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I staid about Fourteen Days at <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
to refresh my self, and then I entred on
my Journy back again to <hi>Vienna:</hi> But I was
entertain'd with an Inauspicious Omen, even
a very sad Spectacle; just as I was gone forth
of the Gates of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> I met whole
Waggon-Loads of Boys and Girls, which were
bringing out of <hi>Hungary</hi> to <hi>Constantinople</hi> to
be sold; no Merchandize is more frequent
amongst them, than that. For, as when we
leave <hi>Antwerp,</hi> we meet with all sorts of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantable
Commodities Importing into the
Town, so here, ever and anon, there passed
by us abundance of Poor Miserable <hi>Christian</hi>
Slaves, which were going to be sold in the
Markets to a perpetual Bondage; there was
no distinction of Age, Old and Young were
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52279:57"/>
driven in Herds, or Companies, or else were
tied in a long Chain, as we use to tail Horses
when we carry them to Fairs; when I beheld
this woful sight, I could not forbear weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and bemoaning the unhappy State of
poor <hi>Christendom.</hi> And if that Miserable
Spectacle were not Afflictive enough for a new
Traveller, take another bad and mortifying
Occurrence: My Collegues had commended
some of their Retinue to me, which were
weary of living in <hi>Turky,</hi> that they might be
of my Train, in returning to their own
Country: I granted their Request, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Travelled Two Days Journy, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
one that was Chief among them, (called
a <hi>Vaivode,</hi> from his Office,) was carried Sick
in a Coach; one of his Feet being bare, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Stockings, he would not suffer it to
be covered, for he had in it a Plague-sore,
which he found more easie to keep open. We
were much troubled at this sight, as fearing
that Infectious Disease would spread further;
but the poor Man liv'd but till we came to
<hi>Adrianople,</hi> and there departed this Life. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Death another Mischief did succeed;
as soon as the Breath was out of his Body, the
rest of the <hi>Hungarians</hi> ran in greedily to the
Prey, one caught up his Stockings, another
his Doublet, a Third his Shift, a Fourth his
other Linen; thus casting themselves, and
us too, into a great deal of danger. Nor was
there any way in the world from hindering
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:52279:57"/>
'Tis true, my Physician, like an honest
Man, ran in amongst them, and intreated
them, for God's sake, to throw them away,
because they would infect us all; but they
were deaf to his Advice. But the Day after
we left <hi>Adrianople,</hi> those self-same Persons
came to him, and complain'd of a Pain in
their Heads, with a Dejection of their Spirits,
and a Listnesness both of Body and Mind,
and desired his Advice; He, (suspecting
the Symptoms of the Plague in the case,) told
them, they were well enough serv'd, for not
harkning to his Counsel; yet he would do
them what good he could, only, being on his
Journy, he was unprovided of proper Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins.
The same Day I walked abroad into
the Field, as I us'd to do as soon as ever I
came to my Inn, to see if I could find any
thing worthy of my Notice in those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
where I met with an unknown Herb in
a Meadow, which smelt like <hi>Garlick.</hi> After I
had pluck'd some Leaves of it, I gave them
to my Physician to know his Judgment; he
looked wistly upon it, and told me, 'twas
<hi>Scordium,</hi> and lifting up his Hands to Heaven,
he gave God thanks for sending us so oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
a Remedy against the Plague; hereupon he
gathers a great quantity of it, and putting it
into a large Pot, boiled it over the Fire.
Then he bid the <hi>Hungarians</hi> take Heart, and
p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ted the Decoction amongst them, prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
the taking of it very hot, as they were
going to Bed, mixt with some <hi>Lemnian</hi> Earth,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52279:58"/>
and <hi>Diascordium,</hi> and that they should not
sleep till they had fallen into a great sweat.
Observing his Directions, the next Day after
they were much better, and desired the same
Potion again, and when they had drunk it,
they grew perfectly well. And thus, by
God's Blessing, we avoided that Infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>And yet, the residue of our Journy was
not without Peril. After we had passed the
Country of the <hi>Thracians</hi> and <hi>Bulgarians,</hi>
which reaches as far as <hi>Nissa,</hi> and came into
the <hi>Servians</hi> Country, reaching from <hi>Nissa</hi> to
<hi>Sema<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dria,</hi> where the <hi>Rascians</hi> Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins;
we came at last to <hi>Belgrade,</hi> the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
being excessively Hot and Parching, for
'twas the hottest time of the <hi>Dog-days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At <hi>Belgrade,</hi> upon one of our Fish-days,
we were presented with abundance of choice
Fish, and, amongst the rest, with large full-Bodied
<hi>Carps,</hi> taken in the <hi>Danube,</hi> whose
<hi>Carps</hi> are very much commended: My Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
did Eat very greedily of them, that was
either the cause, or the occasion, which cast
many of them into a Fever; yet all that quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Fish, which was enough to satisfie
Forty Men, cost but half a Dollar; and the
truth is, other things are as cheap. As for
Hay, 'tis little or nothing worth, the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
are so laden with it, that every Man
may take what he will, provided he pay for
the Mowing and Carriage; which made us to
admire the wisdom of the old <hi>Hungarians,</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:52279:58"/>
after they had passed the <hi>Save,</hi> who chose so
Fertile a Country, as <hi>Hungary,</hi> to dwell in;
where there were all manner of Conveniencies
for Human Life; we passed over a great Tract
of Land, both beyond and on this side the
<hi>Save,</hi> and we found the Grass, Barly, Oats
and Wheat, almost parch'd and withered with
drought; but as soon as we entred <hi>Hungary,</hi>
the Grass was so tall, that a Coach, that went
before, could hardly be seen by another that
came after; which is a great Argument of
the goodness of the Soil.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rascians,</hi> as I told you before, begin at
<hi>Semandria,</hi> and reach as far as the River
<hi>Drave;</hi> they are reputed to be a fudling sort
of People, and not very Faithful to Strangers.
Whence they had their Name and Original,
I do not certainly know; but truly they were
kind enough to us; we passed through some
Villages of theirs of less Note, and at last ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
at <hi>Esseck,</hi> which is almost inclosed with
Muddy Marshes, and is famous for the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Catzianerus,</hi> and the overthrow of the
<hi>Christians.</hi> Here I was taken with a <hi>Ter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ian
Ague,</hi> I was so parch'd with Heat, in Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the open Feilds of <hi>Hungary;</hi> and at <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seck</hi>
we passed the <hi>Drave,</hi> and came to <hi>Zasque,</hi>
where being weary with the Heat of my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and my Ague, I laid me down to rest,
where the chiefest of the place came to me to
bid be welcome; and presented me with large
Melons, with Pears and Plums of several
sorts, besides Wine, and other Provisions,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52279:59"/>
altogether very good, the Noted Country of
<hi>Campania</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> hardly bears better. In the
Room where I Lodged, there was a long Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
all furnished with these Viands: My
Servants desired the <hi>Hungarians</hi> to stay to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
excusing my absence, because of my
Sickness. As soon as I awoke, and saw such
a full-spread Table before my Eyes, I thought
verily I had been in a Dream, and Ask'd my
Physician, How that came about? He told
me plainly, That he himself had caused the
Table to be furnished, that so the very sight
of it might refresh me. But must not I tast
of it, said I? Yes, said he, but you must
only tast. And so I Eat a little of it, and
seem'd to be much the better for it. The Day
after the <hi>Hungarians</hi> came to me again to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
sent their Service, desiring me to represent
their Condition to the Emperor, in regard
of the Wrongs they received from some of
their Neighbours. From thence we came to
<hi>Mohatz,</hi> noted for the Overthrow and Death
of <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>Hungary;</hi> not far from
that Town I saw a River, whose Water was
deep, and its Banks very sleep; here that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Prince leapt in with his Horse, and
was drown'd, being for his Fall as much to be
lamented, as for his Imprudence, in ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
with a small and newly rais'd Army of
his Country-Men, to cope with the more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous,
Veteran, and well-disciplin'd Forces
of <hi>Solyman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:52279:59"/>
From <hi>Mohatz</hi> we Travelled on to <hi>Tul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a,</hi>
and from thence to <hi>Feldnar.</hi> There I passed
over the <hi>Danube</hi> into an Island, pretty large,
called <hi>Cophis,</hi> Inhabited by <hi>Rascians;</hi> and so
repassing the <hi>Danube,</hi> I arrived at <hi>Buda,</hi> (12
Days after I left <hi>Belgrade,) August</hi> the 4<hi>th,</hi>
having lost many of my Horses by the way,
who were Choaked with Eating new Barly,
and Drinking over-old Water. Besides, I
narrowly escaped Robbing, which these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
are much infested with, especially by
those they call <hi>Heydukes,</hi> some of which were
afterwards taken, and put to Death at <hi>Buda,</hi>
where they confessed to the <hi>Bassa</hi> thereof, that
they lay in wait for me, and my Train, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a broken Bridg we were to pass, that so
they might Assault us unawares. And the
truth is, a few may very easily circumvent
and destroy a great many Passengers on such
Bridges; for the Bridges are ill-built, and the
Planks are set so wide, and gaping one from
another, that you can scarce go over them
safe on Horse-back, without danger of falling,
if you are never so careful; and if some meet
you before, others fall on your Rear, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
start out from the Reeds and Sedges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
where they hide themselves, and so Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost
you in the Flank, and you can hardly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
your Horse for Self-Defence, by reason
of the Ilness of the Bridge; no doubt you may
be treated as the <hi>Romans</hi> were in the <hi>Caudine
Streights,</hi> be either taken or killed, at Pleasure.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52279:60"/>
I know not what it was that deterred them
from assaulting of us; whether it were our
Numbers, or the Sight of the <hi>Hungarians</hi> with
us, or because we were in a long Train, and
all were not on the Bridge at once, or what
ever else it was that withheld them, by God's
Blessing, we got safe to <hi>Buda.</hi> The <hi>Bassa</hi> of
the Town was not then at home, he was gone
over to <hi>Pest,</hi> on the other side the River, where
they had a Council of War, after the manner
of the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> they call them <hi>Rachi.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Sanziacks</hi> were already come thither, but
more were expected, for which Cause, when
I desired Audience, 'twas put off for Three
Days, that the <hi>Ianizaries</hi> and Military Persons
might make a greater Show. Then I was sent for
over, and conveyed to his Tent, where he made
Complaints to me of the Injuries that some
<hi>Hungarians</hi> had done to him; It is usual in those
Frontier Garrisons, both for <hi>Hungarians</hi> and
<hi>Turks,</hi> mutually to complain of one another,
yea, sometimes they that are most in Fault,
begin to complain, first. The <hi>Turkish</hi> Bassa
also added some Minatory Expressions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
it may be, he thought that the Sight
of his Army would terrify me; but he was
mistaken, for I answered him roundly, That
the <hi>Hungarians</hi> might rather find Fault with
the <hi>Turks,</hi> than on the contrary; for I my self,
in my Travels had seen some of his Soldiers
plunder some <hi>Hungarians,</hi> subjects of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial.
Majesty, and carry away their Goods.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:52279:60"/>
He answered me, That indeed he had put
some contumacious <hi>Christians</hi> under Military
Execution, but they were such as were under
his Master, not the Emperor. Thus, after a
mutual Altercation, I was dismissed, being in
very bad plight, for my Ague-Fit was sore up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me all that Day.</p>
               <p>The Day after, I went to <hi>Gran,</hi> having a
<hi>Turkish</hi> Guard of Horse along with me, I
had a Mind to be wafted over the <hi>Danube,</hi>
and for one Night to lodge in a Village over
against the Castle of <hi>Gran,</hi> that the Day after
I might come the sooner to <hi>Comorra,</hi> and
be better able to endure my Ague-Fit, which I
expected that Day; and therefore I entreated
that Favour of my Guide, that he would send
some Body over, to bring the Ferry-Boat, that
was on the other Side, that so our Passage
might be the easier. I found some Difficulty
in having my Request granted, yet, partly
to gratify me, and partly to acquaint the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziacks</hi>
with my arival there, he sent over two
Persons; when they were gone an Hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
they spyed Four Horsemen standing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Tree, a little from the High-way-side;
they judged them, by their Habits, to be
<hi>Turks,</hi> and therefore turned aside to accost
them; and as they drew near, they ask'd them,
What News? They answered not a Word,
but made at them with their drawn Swords,
and gave one of them such a Blow, athwart
his Face, that he made the greatest Part of his
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52279:61"/>
Nose to hang down over his Chin; and then
catching at his Horse, which he held by the
Bridle, he left his own Beast, and mounting
it, set Spurs, and away. The <hi>Turks</hi> presently
came back to us, especially he with a maim'd
Face, and with a woful Lamentation, bid us
prepare for the Combat, for we were Way-laid.
I, to encourage my Men, got presently
on Horse-back; but we came too late,
when the Scuffle was over, for they had more
mind to preserve the Prey they had got, than
to fight: And thereupon fled speedily to <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varin,</hi>
a Garrison of ours, to which they did
belong: The <hi>Turks</hi> shewed them to us as they
were scouring over the neighbouring Hills,
that led to <hi>Iavarin.</hi> Thus we came to <hi>Gran,</hi>
the <hi>Sanziack</hi> very friendly gave me a Visit,
and among other Discourse he put me in mind
of the Insolency of the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Soldiers,
who could not be kept from Thieving (said
he) Though you the Emperour's Embassador
were in company of those they robbed; and
therefore he desired me, That the Horse they
took away yesterday might be restored. In
the mean Time, The <hi>Turk,</hi> that was wounded
the Day before, stood without in the Entry,
with his Nose sewen together, through which
he made a lamentable Moan, desiring me to
pity his Condition: I told him I would give
him what was enough for his Cure, and so I
bestowed Two Duckets upon him; he would
have had more, but the <hi>Sanziac</hi> told him,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:52279:61"/>
'twas enough, his Misfortune was not to be
charged upon me.</p>
               <p>Being thus dismissed by the <hi>Sanziack,</hi> I came
the same Day to <hi>Comorra;</hi> where I expected
my Ague-Fit, but when the usual Period of it
drew near, I found it had left me, as if a
<hi>Fever</hi> got in <hi>Turky</hi> durst not accompany me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Christian</hi> Territories: Hereupon I gave
God Thanks, who had both freed me of my
Ague, and had also brought me safe to the end
of my long and tedious Journy.</p>
               <p>Two Days after, I came to <hi>Vienna,</hi> where
the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> my most Gracious
Master, was not at present, only I found
<hi>Maximilian,</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> there in his
Room; whose courteous Reception of me
made me almost forget the Toil of my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
But I must tell you, I was so emaciated
with my Sickness, and the Inconveniencies of
my Journy together, that many thought the
<hi>Turks</hi> had given me a poysonous Dose; for
truly, when I went lately to pay my Duty to
the Arch-Duke <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> he, being then there,
asked one of his Domesticks, who I was?
who answered, I was one that came lately
from <hi>Turky,</hi> and that it was no wonder I lookt
so ill, for they who returned from those Parts,
used so to do.</p>
               <p>Perhaps he was willing to have it believed,
that I had taken the Emperour <hi>Claudius</hi>'s Dose;
but, for my part, I know of no such thing;
neither do I question but that after I had rested
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52279:62"/>
a while, to recover the tediousness of my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
I shall look as well as ever I did, and I
find my self something mended already.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, I acquainted the Emperor
with my Return, by Letter, and of the half-Years
Truce I had obtained, and the sum of
all my whole Negotiation; and when he
came home from the Diet, I would inform him
of all Particulars more punctually and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly.</p>
               <p>One thing more I shall acquaint you with,
There were many Persons who refused to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
me to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> either for Fear,
or I know not what Motive besides, who
wished they had given me any Mony, to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with me, now they saw me return in Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
But what says he in <hi>Plautus? If you will
eat the Kernel, you must take the Pains to break
the Nut:</hi> He does himself Wrong, that thinks
to reap part of the Fruit, who took no part
of the Pains.</p>
               <p>Thus, Sir, I have given an account of my
Journy, both to <hi>Constantinople</hi> and also to
<hi>Amasia;</hi> I have not drest up my Narrative
with Flowers of <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> but have presented
you with it, just as I would have related it to
you by Word of Mouth. I know you will
bear with the Courseness of my Style, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
occasioned by my over-eager Desire to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
you; nor can you well expect Elegancy
from me now in my heat and throng of Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which I was never Master of in my great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:52279:62"/>
Retirements. This I assure you, both for
your Information and my own Content, that
I am not conscious to my self of any Falshood
in the whole Narration, which is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Ornament of such Relations as these.
Thus I bid you Farewel.</p>

               <p>I Receiv'd your Letter, wherein you acquaint
me, that you have receiv'd Information of
my second Voyage into <hi>Turky;</hi> on which Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
you express your wonderment, that I
would venture to visit that uncouth and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Country, once more. And, withal, you
desire to know the Issue of my Journy; How
I found Matters at my return to <hi>Constantinople;</hi>
What Entertainment I met with there; What
Proportion of Health I enjoy; Whether my
Life be pleasant to me, yea or no; and, in
fine, What hopes there may be of my speedy
return to <hi>Germany.</hi> To all which you oblige
me, upon the score of our ancient Friendship,
to give particular and express Answers; which,
to gratifie you, I shall accordingly do.</p>
               <p>Know then, in the first Place, That you
were not mis-informed as to my return into
<hi>Turky,</hi> the thing is most true; neither could I
avoid the Journy, as being oblig'd thereunto
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52279:63"/>
by Promise; and you know every honest Man
is as good as his Word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>My</hi> Case was this, The
Emperor <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> my most gracious Lord
and Master, designed me as his Lieger Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador
to <hi>Constantinople;</hi> but his Design was
grounded on this Supposition, that Peace
would be first setled betwixt the two Empires;
but Articles of Agreement being not yet fully
accorded, nor wholly rejected neither, there
was no reason I should slip my Neck out of
the Collar, till the Matter was brought to some
certain issue, either a firm Peace, or a perfect
Rupture. And, therefore, though I foresaw
what a Bushel of Troubles I should run my
self into, by my return, and had much rather
a fitter Person had been substituted for the
Employment; but no Body being willing to
accept the Charge, I was, in a manner, forced
to the Service; it being my duty to comply
with, and obey, the will and pleasure of my
gracious Master: For asson as ever he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
from the Imperial Diet to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and
was informed, by me, of my Transactions
with <hi>Solyman,</hi> the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperor, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
laid his Command upon me to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
my self to return, and to carry back his
Answer to <hi>Solyman</hi>'s Letters. 'Tis true,
'twas the depth of Winter, I was commanded
to return to <hi>Constantinople;</hi> and, besides, 'twas
a very Rainy, Cold and Tempestuous Season;
and, also, my Message was so severe, that I
was like to have no Thanks for my Labour.
Here, perhaps, you may twit me in the Teeth,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:52279:64"/>
What! twice to the same Pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e? To which
I answer, Twice and oftner, if there be need;
for commendable Enterprizes, the more ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous,
the more Praise-wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hy.</p>
               <p>'Twas in <hi>November</hi> when I left <hi>Vienna,</hi> to
undertake my second Voyage to unhospitable
<hi>Pontus;</hi> I will not grate your Ears with the
Relation of the Gests of my <hi>Second</hi> Journy.
I was too vexatious, I fear, in giving you an
Account of my <hi>First.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may suffice to tell you, that I went the
same Stages, in a manner, that I did at first.
So then, to <hi>Constantinople</hi> I came in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of <hi>Ianuary</hi> (having lost one of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
(who dyed of a Fever in the way.)
There I found my Collegues in good Health;
but a mighty Change was made in the <hi>Turkish</hi>
Affairs: <hi>Bajazet, Solyman</hi>'s youngest Son had
escap'd a great danger, and was reconcil'd to
his Father: <hi>Achmet Bassa,</hi> the <hi>Grand Vizier,</hi>
had been strangled, and <hi>Rustan,</hi> his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,
was restor'd to his Place of <hi>Grand Vizier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;</hi>
of whom more hereafter; but at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
I shall acquaint you what course Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
I met with from their <hi>Emperor,</hi> his
<hi>Bassa's</hi> and other great Men among them. For
their <hi>Bassa's</hi> (as manner is, before they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
an Embassador to their Prince) being
desirous to hear of me, in general, the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of my Message; assoon as they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
that my Master <hi>Caesar</hi> would not recede
a jot from his Right, but did punctually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
upon it as just and equal, that the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sactions
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52279:64"/>
with the Widow <hi>Iohn</hi> late <hi>Vaivod</hi> of
<hi>Transilvania</hi> and her Son, being made without
Fraud, Force or Covin, should be strictly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
they were in a mighty Chafe; for you
must know, that a long-Series of happy Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
hath so elevated the Minds of this People,
that they make their own Wills, forsooth, the
sole Rule of all Reason, Right or Wrong.
On which presumptuous Principle, they carried
it very haughtily towards us; and told us the
extream Danger we would run into, if we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to appear before their Prince with such
an imperious Message. When such menacing
Words could not deter us from demanding
Audience; they gave us to understand, That
they would have no Hand in our Admittance;
for d'e think, (said they) that we are such bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen-fac'd
Fellows as to bring you, with such
sawcy Answers, to our King? No, said they,
it will be as plain Mockery to him, which he
will never take well at your Hands: Do you
not know, proceeded they, that he is come
back from <hi>Persia</hi> with a victorious Army;
where, his Successes have so exalted him, that
he hath put his own Son to death as emulous of
the Empire? Whereby, you may guess at the
severity of his Passion. He longs for, and
courts, a fair occasion to send his handy and
well-disciplin'd Army into <hi>Hungary,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
them with the Spoils of that Country,
and to add the residue thereof to his Empire.
And, therefore, if you be wise, don't <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ouze
up a sleeping <hi>Lyon;</hi> for thereby you will but
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52279:65"/>
hasten your own Miseries, which are coming
on fast enough of themselves. Such were the
Harangues of the <hi>Bassa's</hi> to us, and the rest of
the <hi>Turks</hi> were of the same Mind. The mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Punishment they denounced against us,
was, That two of us would be cast into a
nasty Dungeon, and the third (which was to
be my share) would have his Nose and Ears
cut off, and so sent back to his Master.</p>
               <p>And to strike the greater Terror into us;
the <hi>Turks,</hi> who passed by our Lodgings, gave
us many a sour Look; which was an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that they intended some cruel Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
toward us. And the truth is, from that
day forward, they used us more coursely than
ever; they kept us up close as Prisoners rather
than Embassadors; they suffer'd no Body to
come to us, nor permitted any of us to go
forth; and the rest of their Carriage was as
intolerable. Thus have they treated us these
six Months past; and I know not how long
they will continue these Severities; but, come
what will, we submit to the Will of God.
Our Cause is Just and Honourable, and that
gives us relief against their vigorous Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.
But leaving the Narration of our own
Misfortunes, I shall answer your desire, in
giving you an Account of the Story of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet.</hi>
For the clearer Explication thereof, I
must acquaint you, that <hi>Solyman</hi> had 5 Sons;
the Eldest, begot by him on a Concubine,
near the <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> was called <hi>Mustapha,</hi> of
whose unhappy end you have heard before;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52279:65"/>
but by another Wife, named <hi>Roxolana,</hi> he had
four, <hi>Mahomet, Selymus, Bajazet</hi> and <hi>Gian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gir.
Mahomet</hi> liv'd till he was married, (for
the <hi>Turks</hi> call their Concubines, Wives) but
dy'd soon after; so that <hi>Selimus</hi> and <hi>Bajazet</hi>
of this later Venter only remain'd alive.
As for <hi>Giangir,</hi> he came thus to his end;
when News was brought to <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
that his half-Brother <hi>Mustapha</hi> was put to
death; the Youth being of a timorous Mind
and infirm Body (for he was Crook-back'd)
fell into a grievous Passion, upon the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
that the like Fate did hang over his
own Head; for he could promise safety
to himself no longer than his Father liv'd;
if his Head were once laid, he that was his
Successor would certainly kill all his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
as emulous of the Kingdom; not one
of them would be excepted, and himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
among the number must look for the
same Fate; which Thought struck him into
a Disease, even as if the Bow-string had been
already about his Neck, which cost him his
Life; so that now only <hi>Selymus</hi> and <hi>Bajazet</hi>
remained; <hi>Selymus</hi> was the Elder, and 'twas
known to all, that his Father design'd him for
the Empire; but <hi>Bajazet</hi> was most favoured
and doted upon by his Mother, whether i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
were out of Commiseration to prevent his
inevitable Ruin; or else out of Motherly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,
or whatever else the reason was;
this is certain, if her Vote could have carried
it, <hi>Bajazet</hi> had certainly succeeded in the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:52279:66"/>
Empire after his Fathers death. But she
must give way to his Fathers Will, who was
fully resolv'd, come what would, that <hi>Sely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
and none else, should succeed him. <hi>Bajazet</hi>
was not ignorant thereof, and therefore
he turned every Stone to stave off his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
Fate, and, if possible, to prevent his
Ruin by grasping at the Throne. And his
Hopes were encreased by the favour of his
Mother, and of <hi>Rustan</hi> the <hi>Grand Visier,</hi> who
was thought to have espoused his Interests.
Having two such Pillars to support him, he
thought with himself 'twas far more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to hazard his Life in contending with his
Brother for the Empire, than to die obscurely
by the Bow-string, as a Victim to his Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bajazet</hi> having this Project in his Head, began
to pick Quarrels with his Brother, and to
maintain a Faction against him; neither was
it long before a fitting Occasion offered it self
for him to begin his design'd Enterprize, of
rising in Arms upon the Account of <hi>Mustapha</hi>'s
death, and the disgust of many thereupon.
For the truth is, <hi>Mustapha</hi> was so well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd
in his Life-time, and so much lamented
at his Death, that those who had placed all
their hopes of advancement from him alone,
were almost unwilling to live after him; so
that they did but wait for an Opportunity to
revenge his Death, or to die as he did: Others,
who were conscious to themselves that they
had favoured his Party, and therefore were
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:52279:66"/>
obnoxious to the present Power, did not care
what Hurly-burlies they made; ready they
were for any Innovation, only they wanted a
Leader. In which case, they did not well
know what to do. As for <hi>Mustapha</hi> himself,
they knew he could not be recalled from the
Dead; yet it was in their power to suborn
and set up a feigned <hi>Mustapha</hi> in his stead, as
if the true one had been yet alive. This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
pleased <hi>Bajazet</hi> (who was the Contriver
of the Plot) best of all, as most conducible to
the accomplishment of his purpose. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by his Emissaries, he procures a mean
Fellow, but bold and ready-witted, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
himself to be <hi>Mustapha;</hi> and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
was more plausible, because his Stature,
Physiognomy and Meen of his Body did some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
resemble <hi>Mustapha</hi>'s. This Man begun,
first, to shew himself in that part of <hi>Thrace</hi>
which was above <hi>Constantinople,</hi> toward the
<hi>Danube, Moldavia</hi> and <hi>Valachia.</hi> This Place
he thought most opportune to raise a Party, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was full of Horse, which part of the
<hi>Turkish Militia</hi> did most favour <hi>Mustapha.</hi>
Here he starts up, as if he had fled in Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haste
from some remote Place, with a few in
his Company; which he pretended was for
his own Security: His Followers being asked
by the Country, Who he was? They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
at first, whisperingly, That it was
<hi>Mustapha.</hi> Hereupon they were more desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to know the Truth; and then he was
forced to declare himself, That he was <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stapha,</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:52279:67"/>
indeed. Having made this prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
beginning, he goes on to gratulate his
Safety among them, and to give God thanks.
<hi>First,</hi> he told them, <hi>That when he was sent for
by his angry Father, he durst not trust himself to
come into his Presence; but, by his Friends Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
suborned one, somewhat like him, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
his Person, that, by another Mans hazard
rather than his own, he might make Tryal of his
incensed Father's Inclination towards him. This
Man he hir'd with great Promises of Reward;
but assoon as he came to his Father he was strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
at his Tent-door, before he had any opportunity
to make his Defence; and his dead Body was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to the View of the Soldiery. At which time,</hi>
said he, <hi>there were some few that smelt out the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
but most part was deceived by the disguised
Lineaments of his deceased Body, and thought it
was he himself that was s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ain. Assoon as I heard
of this,</hi> said he, <hi>I saw there was no stay for me,
but I must consult my Safety by a speedy Flight;
I took but few in my Company, that I might be
the less taken notice of, and thus passing over</hi>
Pontus <hi>and the</hi> Bosphoran <hi>Country, I am,</hi> said
he, <hi>come hither; where I promise my self much
Aid from your Fidelity, and, therefore, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you lend me your helping hand; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I am oppress'd by a wretched Step-mother, be

were all ready to do in my Prosperity. For my
part, I am resolved to revenge my Wrong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o

other Course, pray, can I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ake? I owe my Life to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52279:67"/>
my Fathers mistake, who killed another Man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of me; so that I plainly see, what Fate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
me, if ever I come into his Power. The
miserable old Man is imposed on by the enchanting
Passions of a Step-mother, whom he doats upon, and
by the Ministry of</hi> Rustan, <hi>to whatsoever Attempt
they please. But, thanks be to God,</hi> said he, <hi>I
have got some Friends left to revenge my Wrongs,
and to punish my Enemies. And, besides, I am
not quite daunted, but have a great Stock yet of
Courage left; for I know that the</hi> Janizaries, <hi>yea,
and most of all my Fathers Court are on my side;
and, besides, upon hearing of my Name, I know
all those which lamented me when dead (as they
thought) will flock in to me, now they hear I am
alive; only be you pleased to vouchsafe me a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
Reception, and to protect me till sufficient
Aid come in to me.</hi> These were his private,
and also his publick, Harangues, where-ever
he came; and his instructed Followers eccho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
forth the same Report; yea, some Men of
Note, that <hi>Bajazet</hi> had suborned, sung Notes
to the same Tune. Thus a great Party of
Men, unknown to <hi>Bajazet,</hi> were brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Nooz. For the matter was carried so
cunningly, that those who knew <hi>Mustapha,</hi>
and saw him lie dead before his Father's Tent,
yet were afraid to believe their own Eyes,
but suffered themselves to be persuaded, that
this was the true <hi>Mustapha</hi> indeed; yea, some
of <hi>Mustapha</hi>'s Intimates, who knew this was
but a Cheat, yet were so overfond of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
that blinded either with Fear,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:52279:68"/>
Grief or Anger, they wers the first that li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ted
themselves under this Pseudo-<hi>Mustapha,</hi> as
being weary of their Lives without him;
which made others certainly think, that this
was the true <hi>Mustapha</hi> indeed, whom Report
had falsely related to be slain. And, besides,
the Impostor himself, by large Promises and
great Largesses, which he said were the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
of his former Acquists, (but indeed
were the Supplies that <hi>Bajazet</hi> had provided
under-hand) did not cease to cajole and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
his Followers. So that in a very few
days he got an handsome Body of Men toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
fit for a little Army, and they encreased
every day.</p>
               <p>When (lo!) <hi>Solyman</hi> was made acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Messages and Letters, which the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<hi>Sanziacks,</hi> had, in great trepidation,
sent him, what hazard he was in by reason of
the Resort of such Multitudes, to this Pseudo-<hi>Mustapha.</hi>
The cunning old Man knew one
of his Sons must needs be privy to the Plot,
and, therefore, he made haste to disappoint
it; chiding his <hi>Sanziacks,</hi> by Letter, that they
suffered the Matter to come to such an Head,
and had not rather crush'd the <hi>Cockatrice</hi> in
the Egg; but seeing they had been negligent
hitherto, he commanded them to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
for their former Remisness, and to
send him presently the Traitor and his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Prisoners, in Chains, to receive thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
condign Punishment; and to facilitate the
Matter, he would send Aid to them by one of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:52279:68"/>
his <hi>Visiers, Partan Bassa,</hi> who had married
the Widow of <hi>Mahomet</hi> aforesaid; howbeit,
he advised them, if they would purge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elves
of their Criminal Neglect, they
should quell the Insurrection before his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
came. <hi>Partan</hi> had but a few Troops
with him, but they were choice Men, eminent
for Courage and Faithfulness. <hi>Solyman</hi> took
care to cull out Colonels, Captains and other
Commanders of that <hi>Gizard</hi> for this Service,
as suspecting that others might have been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
or enticed to pass over to the Tents
of the Rebels; for, the Truth was, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
sort of <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> upon account of
<hi>Mustapha's</hi> Name, did not seem much averse
from the Party; and, therefore, did not care
what further Confusions might enhance the
Danger on that side</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sanziacks,</hi> assoon as ever they receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Solyman's</hi> minatory Dispatches, began to
bestir themselves, and to rouze up one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
so that happy was he, that could do
most Damage to the growing Party of the
Impostor; some of those that were going in
to him, they intercepted; those that had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
join'd him they laboured to discourage
by terrible Meances and Denunciations of the
danger they were in. In the mean time, the
Forces of <hi>Partan Bassa</hi> were marching on,
and being almost come up to the Place, the
Party of the Tumultuous, being not yet
fully setled, seeing so great Preparations made
against them, began to be discouraged, (as is
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:52279:69"/>
usual with Men in such Circumstances) and to
drop off one by one; and at last the whole
Body of 'em most shamefully left their Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and shifted for themselves, the best they
could. Their feigned <hi>Mustapha,</hi> with his
chief Partisans and Setters on, would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have done so too, but he was so watch'd by
the <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> that he was taken alive, and
sent Prisoner to <hi>Partan,</hi> who, with a strong
Guard, sent him to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> When he
came thither, <hi>Solyman</hi> put him on the Rack,
and by that means found out the whole Plot;
how his Son <hi>Bajazet</hi> was at the bottom of it,
and had resolved if they had not been so soon
dissipated, to have join'd them with a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Force, and so either to have marched
directly to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> or else (if Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
had served him) to have sought out
his Brother; but being slow in his Actings, his
Design was nipp'd in the very Bud. When
<hi>Solyman</hi> had thus ferretted out the Design to
the bottom, he caused him and his Abettors to
be thrown into the Sea at Midnight, not
thinking it convenient to have the Matter di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulg'd
among his own People, or that foreign
Princes should be acquainted with the Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
Differences of his own Family.</p>
               <p>As for his Son <hi>Bajazet,</hi> he was mightily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperated
against him for his foul Offence, and
was meditating in his Mind what grievous
Punishment he should inflict upon him. In the
mean time, his Wife being a prying Woman,
and therefore allowing him but little space for
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:52279:69"/>
his Anger to vent and cool it self, at last fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into Discourse with him of the Affair, she
began to excuse her Son, laying all the Fault
on his Youthful Imprudence; and that some of
his Ancestors also had been necessitated to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
the like Attempts. For (says she)
'tis a natural Instinct in all Men to do what
they can for themselves and their Friends, and
to save their Lives, if they can; especially
young Men, in the fervour of Youth, are apt
to be drawn aside by ill Counsellors to perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Attempts; and, therefore, it was but
reasonable that his first Fault should be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
because, if he repented thereupon, his
Father had gained a great Point in preserving
his Son; but if he relapsed again into the same
Crime, then the Father was at liberty to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
deserved Punishment on him for both Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
at one and the same time. But, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
she, if you will not pardon him for
his own sake, yet be pleased to do it for mine;
and spare our own common Flesh and Blood:
For how, think you, can I bear it, that of
two Sons which God hath yet left me, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>our Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
would rend one of them from me? And,
therefore, she intreated him to moderate his
Anger, and not to let loose the reins to Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
tho' you had never so just an Occasion-Almighty
God (said she) tho' most Powerful
and Just, yet doth not always exert his highest
Severities, but tempers them with Indulgence,
else Mankind w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uld be quickly destroyed.
And if Clemency be to be shew'd to any, to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:52279:70"/>
whom, pray, more properly than to a Man's
own Children? <hi>Bajazet,</hi> for the future, will
certainly keep within the bounds of his Duty,
and the fear, wherein he now is, will certainly
be turn'd into the highest Degree of filial O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
for the Future; if you please to spare
his Life, the Sense of your Indulgence will
work this; for nothing is so obliging to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Minds as Courtesies received. The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of his Pardon will restrain him from
running a second time into the like Offence;
yea, I my self will undertake for him, that
for the future he will carry it towards you,
as a most dutiful and obedient Son.</p>
               <p>To these Intreaties she added Tears and
Blandishments, so that the old Man, who was
Uxorious enough before, could no longer
withstand her Importunities, but changed his
Mind; and instead of Punishing, resolved to
Pardon his Son; but on this Condition, that
he was to come into his Presence and receive
his Commands. His Mother, being exceeding
glad at the good Success of her Interposal, was
not wanting to the Occasion; but presently
acquainted <hi>Bajazet</hi> by Letters, that when ever
he was sent for, he should not scruple in the
least to come to his Father, for she had wrought
a Reconciliation betwixt them, so that not the
least Spark of Discontent lay now covered in
his Mind against him. Upon the Receipt of this
good News, <hi>Bajazet</hi> resolves to trust his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
yet not without some Relicks of Fear;
he reflected ever and anon on his Brother <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stapha,</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:52279:70"/>
whose Example warned him of the
Danger he underwent. However, conquering
his Fear, come he did to the Place of Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
appointed by his Father, it was called
<hi>Carestrane,</hi> some few Miles distant from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For you must know, that now-a-days, 'tis
the Custom of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Emperors, never to
permit any one of their Sons, when once
they are grown up, to set their Foot within
the Gates of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> (whilst they are
alive) for fear they should ingratiate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with the Soldiery, and so set up for
themselves. As he was alighting from his
Horse, some of his Father's Servants were at
hand to take away his Sword and Dagger;
this struck his guilty Conscience into a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Fear, tho' it were accustomed to be done to
others, that they might come unarmed into
their Emperor's Presence: But his Mother,
who had placed her self on purpose near his
Passage, looked out at a Window, using these
Expressions, <hi>Chear up, chear up, my Son,</hi> by
which Antidote he was very much heartned and
relieved.</p>
               <p>As soon as ever he came into his Fathers Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
the old Man bid him sit down, and then
began to blame him very severely for his rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
in taking up Arms so causelessly. They
may be looked upon, said he, as taken up
against my self; but grant you took them up
only against your Brother, yet it takes off
little from your Offence, for if you had had
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:52279:71"/>
your Wish, the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Religion would have
been quite shaken, if not overthrown by the
Domestick Discords among our Family, (on
the Heirs whereof it doth depend) so that if
you be a true <hi>Mussulman,</hi> such a Crime ought
to have been far from your Thoughts: I might
aggravate your Crime (said he) by telling
you, That you aspired at the Government in
my Life-time, which is so contemptuous a
Thing, that your Offence is almost inexpiable:
Nevertheless, I am resolved to pardon you,
and to shew my self a loving Father rather
than a just Judge, that so for the future you
may leave all to God; for Kingdoms, and the
Governments of them are not disposed of by
Mans Pleasure, but by the Will of God;
if he hath decreed that you shall have the
Kingdom after me, no Man living will be able
to hinder it: But, if God had otherwise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
'twas a mad Thing in you to go
about to resist his Will, for that were to fight
against God; and therefore let me advise you
to be quiet, and not disturb your peaceable
Brother, nor interrupt the Quiet of my old
Age; for, I will assure you, if you commit a
second Offence, of this Nature, I will be so
far from pardoning you, that you shall have
the Severity of Justice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s Answer was very Submissive, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
his Fault, and promising Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
for the future. Whereupon <hi>Solyman</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for Drink, and caused it to be given to
his Son, (as the Custom is) which was a Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:52279:71"/>
made of Sugar and the Juice of certain
Fruit. <hi>Bajazet</hi> had rather have let it alone,
as fearing it might have been his last Draught,
but he could not handsomely refuse it, so he
drank a little, and his Father drank a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him, which freed him of his Fear. Thus
<hi>Bajazet</hi> was dismissed, and sent away to his
Government, his Congress with his Father
having been far more auspicious than his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Mustapha</hi>'s was.</p>
               <p>As for the Death of <hi>Achmet Bassa,</hi> another
of your Enquiries, I shall give this short Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Some say, he was put to Death for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too much affected to <hi>Mustapha,</hi> and for
favouring underhand the Counterfeit <hi>Musta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,</hi>
and encouraging <hi>Bajazet</hi> in his Designs.
Others say, That being a mere Robber or
Swashbuckler at first, but advanced for his
Audacity, Valour and Skill in Military Affairs,
to that high Dignity, the Punishment of his
former flagitious Life was only deferred
to the last Period of it. And some were of
Opinion, he was executed only to make Way
for <hi>Rustan;</hi> for <hi>Solyman</hi> having promised
<hi>Achmet</hi> never to take away the Seal from him,
as long as he lived; to make a collusive Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of his Word, he caused him to be
put to Death, before he did it. Some said,
That <hi>Solyman</hi> gave it out, 'Twas better to dye
once than a Thousand Times over; for the
Fear of the Loss of his <hi>Grand Viziership,</hi> and
much more his Survival thereupon, would have
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:52279:72"/>
been as a Thousand Deaths to him. Whatever
was the Cause, the Manner of it was this;
He came early in the Morning into the
Divan, (or Council-Chamber) being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of what was designed against him:
By and by comes a Messenger to him from
the <hi>Sultan,</hi> telling him, That he must die.
He was a Man of a great Spirit, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Message as undauntedly as if it
had nothing concerned him; only when
the Executioner drew near, to do his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
he pushed him away, as thinking it
dishonourable for a Man of his Dignity
to dye by the Hands of an ordinary Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner:
But casting his Eyes round about
the Company, he espied a creditable Person,
that was his Friend, him he desired to do
that last Office for him, and he should
take it as a great Kindness at his Hands;
his Friend, upon his iterated Request, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
it: Only <hi>Achmet</hi> advised, Not to
draw the Cord or Bow-string, so as to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatch
him at once, but when he had
strained it a little, then to remit it, that
he might breath a little, and afterwards
to pull it as hard as he could, until he
were dead; wherein his Desire was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.
Thus <hi>Achmet</hi> was willing (as it
were) to taste of Death, before he drank
his full Draught thereof. Upon his Decease
<hi>Rustan</hi> had the <hi>Grand-Viziership</hi> bestowed upon
him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:52279:72"/>As for my Return out of this Country,
which you desire to hear of, all I can say is,
<hi>Facilis descensus Averni;</hi> he that brought
me hither, will, when he sees good, bring
me back: In the Interim, I solace my
self in the Company of my old Friends, my
Books, which never fail to afford me Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
both Day and Night.</p>

               <p>THE Relations, you heard, was very true;
for it is most certain, that all my Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
are returned home, and poor I am left
behind, alone. And whereas you propound
several Questions to me, as, What Fate, or
what malevolent Star kept me back from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying
them in their Return? And why
I did not shake Hands with that barbarous
Country, to enjoy the wish'd for Comforts
of my own? And withal, you demand,
What memorable Matters I have seen or heard
of since I wrote last? promising to give credit
to whatever drops from my Pen, as if it were
as true as Gospel. And moreover, you desire
to know the Course of my Studies, and how I
relieve my self both in my Solitudes and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings?
And whether I go abroad or always
stay at home? All these Postulations put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
will engage me to write rather Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
or Diaries, than a single Letter,
especially since you are very earnest to know,
How <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s Matters stand, (concerning
which, you say, there are various Reports
with you.) You claim a Promise from me,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:52279:73"/>
and unless I perform it, you tell me you will
commence an Action against me, and have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
drawn your Breviat against me: Let me pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
your Metaphor, and perswade you to
stay a while, <hi>Leniter qui saeviunt sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

says the Old Adage, No haste to kill true Men:
But if you are so much given to Law, take
Use and Principal too, rather than I will answer
your Suit, for I am averse from <hi>Lawing.</hi> And
besides, the Distance of Place is so great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us, that if I should put in an Exception
to your <hi>Plea,</hi> yet your Writ would hardly
abate. However it be, I will rather satisfy your
Desires, than contend with you in the least:
When my Collegues (whose Names I gave you
in my last Letters) perceived, that our Three
Years abode in this Place had produced little
good hitherto, either to the making of a firm
Peace, or the continuing the Truce; and that
small Hopes of either did appear for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
they laboured with Might and Main to
be dismissed by this Court; and when, with
much ado. <hi>Solyman</hi>'s Consent was obtained
therein, (for 'tis no easy matter to get a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
from hence) then the only Question
was, Whether we should all go, or only those
of us that came first, and so had been longest
there? For cunning <hi>Solyman,</hi> that he might
not seem over-desirous of Peace, by retaining
one of us, remitted the Matter wholly to our
own Choice. In these Circumstances, my
Companions thought it very advisable, and
for our Master's Service, that one of us should
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:52279:74"/>
stay behind, and I my self was of the same
Mind; but we resolved to dissemble our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
and conceal them from the <hi>Turks,</hi> so
that as often as we had any Discourse with
them on that Subject, I always pretended, I
was utterly unwilling to stay behind. 'Tis
true, I told them I came thither to reside as
Embassador in Ordinary, but it was on Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
That Peace would be made between
both Empires; but That not being yet done, I
did not see how I could well stay, but to the
Damage and against the Will of my Master,
and therefore it was best that we should all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
together. Thus I reasoned before them,
that so I might stay on better Terms, rather
by their Entreaty than by my own voluntary
Offer. I knew well enough, that if we all
went away, it would not only open Door for
a War, but it would even quite shut out all
Hopes of Peace; which later was not despair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of, if I staid behind: For whilst Dispatches
were sent to and from both Princes, it would
spin out a great deal of Time, in which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval
something or other might fall out of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to our Cause; so that it was better
to do any thing, than to precipitate ourselves
into a fierce and cruel War; and yet I was
not ignorant, how prejudicial my stay would
be to my self, for thereby my fair and labour
would be doubled, in regard One was to do the
Work of Two or Three: Besides, many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
might occasionally arise, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if the Issue of my Transactions did termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52279:74"/>
in a War: And yet, I must tell you, he
that Undertakes the Office of a publick Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador,
must post-p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne all such private Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
and make light of them, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
of the Publick Good of his Prince and
Country. And I had a fair Opportunity to
manage this Affair by the Complaisance of
<hi>Rustan,</hi> who was very desirous of my Stay;
for that subtle <hi>Vizier</hi> easily foresaw, what a
shrewd Step towards a War it would be, if we
should all be gone and leave the Negotiation
for a Peace unfinished. The old Fox was averse
from War, upon this account principally, he
foresaw, That if <hi>Solyman</hi> made an Expedition
into <hi>Hungary,</hi> it was impossible to prevent the
Discords of his Children; for if <hi>Selymus</hi> were
willing to be quiet, yet <hi>Bajazet</hi> would attempt
Innovation, especially since he was favoured
by himself, his Wife and Mother-in-law; and
such Commotions, he knew, would be fatal to
him: And therefore, when we were once at
his House, he made a long Harangue to my
Colleagues, advising them what to say to
their Master at their Return, in order to a
Peace. As for me, he advised me by all means
to stay behind, and not to desert a Business so
well begun 'till it came to a desired Issue;
and there's no doubt, said he, but the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
your Master, who always shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
inclining to Peace, will approve well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough
of your Stay. Yet, nevertheless, I
continued Deaf to his Request, as far as with
Safety I could, and insisted on my Return;
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:52279:75"/>
which edg'd him on the more, to perswade
me to stay: What, says he, will you cut off
all Hopes of Peace for ever? Our Emperor
longs for nothing more than to send an Army
into <hi>Hungary,</hi> and he had long since done it,
if I had not made use of some Female In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
(under standing his Wife and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law)
to disswade him; yea, as it were
to pluck him back by the Sleeve; and therefore,
if you be wise, don't you rouze a sleeping
Lyon to destroy you. upon this I began to
yield a little, and was less peremptory in my
Refusal to stay, only I told them, my greatest
Remora was, I was afraid of their Crimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that if Matters succeeded not as they
would have them, the whole Blame would be
cast upon me (tho' it was not in my Power to
help it) and therefore they would make me
feel the Fruits of their Indignation. But <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan</hi>
bid me, Be of good chear, whatever the
Event were; if unsuccessful, it should not be
imputed to me; if I would but stay, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to have me to be under his immediate
Protection, and would treat me (to use his
own Word) as if I were his Natural Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
I told him, I would consider of it, and
so we parted for that Time.</p>
               <p>The next Day we were called into the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van,</hi>
(so they call their <hi>Council Chamber)</hi> then
the same Part was acted over again, only
<hi>Rustan</hi> carried it a little more covertly, and
reservedly, because of the Presence of other
<hi>Bassas,</hi> there, at last, I yielded to stay behind,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:52279:75"/>
only leaving a Memorial with them of this
Import, That I staid behind unknown to my
Master, and therefore I would leave all my
Concessions to his Arbitrement, to cancel or
confirm; as for my self, I would be respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for nothing, nor oblige my self by any
Promise, whatever issue God were pleased to
give of my Negotiation. This Memorial
did me a great Kindness after wards, in diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
Circumstances, so that the <hi>Bassas</hi> could
not for shame treat me so severely in their
Passions, as otherwise they would have done.</p>
               <p>Thus, Sir, you have an account of my
Stay behind my Fellows, with the Reason
thereof. They left <hi>Constantinople</hi> about the
later end of <hi>August</hi> 1557. The Winter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> went to <hi>Adrianople,</hi>
as his Custom was, both to strike a greater
Terror into <hi>Hungary,</hi> upon the bruit of his
nearer approach thither, and also for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
of his Hunting, for there the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are colder than at <hi>Constantinople</hi> both
which he thought conducive to his He 1th. The
Country thereabouts is full of Marshes and
Stagnant Waters, by reason of the vicinity of
many Rivers; so that there are abu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dance of
Water-foul, as wild Ducks, Geese, Herons,
Storks, Cranes, Bitturns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To catch them,
he makes use of Hawks, or a lesser sort of
Eagles, which are so used to the Sport, that
tho' the Foul fly up to the Clouds, they I fetch
him down from thence; but if they fly lower,
then they truss them, and with a mighty Force
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:52279:76"/>
strike them with their Bills to the Ground. I
am told, That some of his Falcons are so disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd
and expert, that they will venture on a
Crane, even in that part of the Body where the
Wing joyns it; and by this means the <hi>Cranes</hi> Bill
can do them no hurt, and so they tumble to the
Ground with their Prey: And yet sometimes
the Hawk pays dear for his Boldness for if
he do but miss his Gripe never so little, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
the Crane runs him through with his
Bill and down he tumbles dead to the Ground.</p>
               <p>For this Reason, the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
every Year, a little before Winter, goes to
<hi>Adrianople,</hi> and returns not again to <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi>
till the Frogs begin to be troublesome to
him by their croaking. Thither <hi>Rustan,</hi> a
while after, sent for me by Letter; he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
some Horse to guard me on the Way,
and Sixteen <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> whether as a Guard to
me, or upon me, I leave to you to judge: We
made long Journys, for he advised us to make
haste: On the Third Day my <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Foot, began to grumble, the Ways were
dirty, as is usual at that Time of the Year;
they complained, That they were forced to
march more Miles, often, in a Day, than they
used to do; and that, if their Emperour were
there, they could hardly endure it.</p>
               <p>Their Complaints troubled me not a little,
because I was loth to disoblige this sort of
People, and therefore I consulted with my
Servants, how I might allay their Discontents,
and make them willinger to travel. One of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:52279:76"/>
mine told me, he had observed that they were
much taken with a certain kind of Caudle,
Gruel or Pottage, which my Cook used to
make of Wine, Eggs, Sugar and Spices;
Perhaps (says he) if they have some of that
for their Break-fast, they will be plyable. This
seemed but a mean Expedient, yet we resolv'd
to try it, and the Success answered our Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation;
for after this sweet Soop, being also
further heated with a Glass or two of Wine,
away they trudged, as merrily as could be,
and told me, they would accompany me, on
the same Terms, to <hi>Buda,</hi> if I pleased.</p>
               <p>When I came to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> I was forced to
hear the Railings, rather than the Complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
of <hi>Rustan,</hi> concerning the Plundering-Excursions
of the <hi>Hungarians.</hi> And, by way
of Answer, I was as ready to complain to him
of the frequent Depredations and Mischiefs,
which the <hi>Turks</hi> did in <hi>Christian</hi> Countries.
No marvel, said I, if our retort like for like;
for I had just then received an Express from
<hi>Caesar,</hi> my Master, informing me, what Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and Contraventions the <hi>Turks</hi> had made
of that Truce, which at the Departure of
my Collegues was agreed upon: How they
vexed the poor Peasants with continual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodes,
robbing them of their Goods, and
made themselves, their Wives and Children,
Slaves.</p>
               <p>I must not forget-to-acquaint you, how that
the same Day, <hi>Caesar,</hi> my Master's, Messenger
came to me with an Express. There happen'd
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:52279:77"/>
an Earthquake at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> which gave him
occasion to tell me, That he perceived the
same (so he judge it) at <hi>Nissa, S. Sophia</hi> and
other Places through which he travelled, so
that the Air, included in the Bowels of the
Earth, did seem to have kept Pace with him, by
some subterraneous Passages or Caverns, and
to have travelled as far in a Day under Ground,
as he himself had done on the Surface of the
Earth; which conjecture afterward seemed to
be confirmed, upon the Relation we received
of an Earthquake that happen'd in <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi>
Four Days after, which seemed to be the
same imprisoned Air, that had made its way,
under Ground, even to that City also.</p>
               <p>I leave the Matter to your Judgment, but this
is certain, That Earthquakes are very frequent
at <hi>Constantinople;</hi> for once, when I was there,
about Mid-night, my Lodging did so shake, that
it was almost ready to fall: This Accident awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
me, though fast asl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ep, and, having a
Watch Light burning by me all Night, when
I saw here a Cup, there a Book, a Table,
Board and Stone all tumbled in an Heap toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
I was at first astonished at the Nov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lty
of the Spectacle, till I had recollected my self,
and judging it to be the effects of an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,
I then retired to that part of the
House which I thought most secure from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
The same Commotion of the Earth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
some Days, but not with like Violence.
Yea, over all that great City, and especially
in my Lodgings, and in the Temple of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:52279:77"/>
S. <hi>Sophia,</hi> you might see the Walls, though
very thick, to chink and gape by reason of
the Clefts made by such Earthquakes.</p>
               <p>Well, I staid about Three Months at <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anople,</hi>
where after I had made a Truce for
Seven Months, in <hi>March</hi> I was attended back
again to <hi>Constantinople:</hi> When I came thither
I was quite weary to be mew'd up in my old
Lodging, it was so close, and therefore I
dealt with my <hi>Chiaux,</hi> (a sort of Officers among
the Turks, which serve for divers Employments,
of which Attendance on Embassadors is one)
that I might have Liberty (as other Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
had before me) to hire an House at my
own Charge, where I may have the Benefits of
Gardens, Orchards, and a free Air, to breath
in. The <hi>Chiaux</hi> was not averse from my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal,
for he saw that the <hi>Grand Siegnior</hi>'s Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
was concerned therein, who was
wont to hire Houses for Embassadors, at the
yearly Rent of 400 Ducats; and now all
that Expence would be saved: Hereupon I
went to an House or Island rather, hired with
my own Mony, where there was a broad Field
adjoyning, where I resolved to make a Garden,
and to relieve my wearisom Embassy, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
and planting it: But, see the Spight
of it, when the <hi>Chiaux</hi> found by Experience
that he could not have as strict an Inspection
over me, in an open House that had many
Ways to it, with a large space of ground near
it, as he had in a <hi>Caravasa</hi> (which Word
you know the meaning of by my former Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters)
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:52279:78"/>
because this later was fenced with Cross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barr'd
Windows, and besides, had but one
Passage into it, he began to change his Mind,
and thereupon made his Address to the <hi>Bassas,</hi>
who by this time were returned from <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
that I might retire to my former Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
And I was to look upon This as a great
Courtesy too, for some of the <hi>Bashas,</hi> in a
Debate betwixt them, concerning my dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal,
were of Opinion, that now I was alone,
a less House would serve my turn, and so some
Charge might be saved; but the moderatest
Party carried it, That I should return to my
old Quarters.</p>
               <p>If you desire a Description of the House I
lodged in, take it thus. It is scituated on a
Rising Ground, in the most celebrated part of
<hi>Constantinople;</hi> in the Back-side thereof there is
a pleasant, but somewhat distant, Prospect
to the Sea, which yet is not so remote from
it, but that you may easily discern the Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins
skipping and playing therein: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
at a vast distance a Man may see Mount
<hi>Olympus</hi> in <hi>Asia,</hi> which wears a snowy-white
Cap all the Year! It lyes-open to the Wind
from every Quarter, which by ventilating the
Air, makes it more wholsom and healthy. But
the <hi>Turks</hi> are so envious to their <hi>Christian</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
that they would cut them off from as
many Conveniencies as they can, and therefore
they do not only set Iron Grates before their
Windows, but do also add Iron Boards and
Planks to hinder the Prospect, and the free
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:52279:78"/>
Passage of the Air; and by this means they
stop the Mouths of the Neighbouring <hi>Turks,</hi>
who are apt to complain, that they can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in their Houses but the Christians must
overlook them. The House is built in a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drangular
Form, with a large Square in the
midst, wherein there is a Well. The upper
Part of the House, which is all thereof that
is inhabited, is divided into Galleries,
which go round it, and into Lodging Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
The Galleries look down into the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drangle
within, and without are the Lodgings,
which have all a Passage into them; there are
a great many of them, but they are small and
uniform, as the Cells or Chambers of Monks
are with us. The Front stands over against
the High-Way, leading to the <hi>Seraglio;</hi> and
the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> every <hi>Friday</hi> (which is their
Sabbath, as the Lord's Day is with us) passes
by it to his Devotions, so that Embassadors
may easily see him out of their Windows.
And the Family, together with the <hi>Chiaux</hi>
and the <hi>Ianizaries</hi> do obeysance to him in the
Porch, or do re-salute him rather; for the
Fashion of the <hi>Turks</hi> is, that the Greater doth
first of all salute the Less, and therefore the
<hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> as he passes, first salutes the
People with a Nod of his Head; and then
they very officiously pay their Courts to him,
with Acclamations and Shouts.</p>
               <p>The lower Part of the House is designed
for the Stabling of Horses; and to preserve
it from Fire <hi>within,</hi> it is all built with
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:52279:79"/>
Vaults or arch'd Roofs, and <hi>without</hi> it is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with Lead. 'Tis true, such kind of
Building hath some Advantages, and it hath
as many Inconveniencies to ballance them:
For all things are made therein for necessary
use, but nothing for Delight and Pleasure;
there is nothing of Beauty or Novelty that
can entertain your Eye; there is no Garden
belonging to it, to divert a Man by walking;
there is neither Tree, Shrub nor green
Herb, to delight your Eye, you have only
many Wild Beasts as your troublesome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
and Companions; Snakes you have in
abundance, store of Weazils, Lizards and
Scorpions; so that, sometime, when you
would fetch your Hat in the Morning, from
the Place you left it the Night before, you
find it surrounded with a Snake, as with a
terrible Hat Band: And yet these Animal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
afforded me some kind of Divertisement in
my Solitude, (for you must give me leave to
tell you all my entertainments.) I once saw
a Weazil fiercely combating with a Snake
and though the whole Family look'd upon her,
yet she was not terrified therewith; but tho
her Adversary struggled, and made what De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
he could, yet she victoriously haled him
in to her Hole. Another Time I saw a Weaz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
carrying her Young Weasling from one Place
of the House to another, which, as she was<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
doing, she leapt down upon the middle of the
Table, where I and some of my Guests were
sitting after Dinner, having a young one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:52279:79"/>
her Mouth, which she very fairly left among
us on the Table, and skipt no farther than
the Door, (as if she had waited what Event
would be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ide her youngling) when we had
satisfied our selves with the Sight of that, yet
shapeless, Animal, we laid it down upon the
Ground, and then the Dam ran hastily, and
snatching it up, carried it to her desired
Place. Another time I saw either a Snake
or a Dragon, or a Serpent, trod to Pieces by
the Horses Feet, in the Stable; her Belly was
very big, and, after I had caused it to be
opened, I found Three huge Mice therein.
'Twas a Wonder to me, how such a slow and
creeping Animal could catch so swift and so
running an one; and after he had catch'd
him how he could swallow him down, by
reason of the narrowness of his Throat and
Jaws. But my Wonderment was soon abated
when I beheld another Snake seize upon a
mighty Toad, and after he had him in his
Mouth, he began at the hinder Part, and had
devoured a great deal thereof, and yet the
Toad was still alive, and did what he could
with his Fore-Feet to deliver himself from
his Enemy: 'Twas in this very Posture when
I saw it first, which made me to admire and
to be almost of the Opinion, that I saw a
Monster, an Animal with Two Feet and a
Tail, as long as a Serpent, but when I drew
nearer, and perceived what it was, as I hit
the Snake with my Staff, to make him let go
his Prey, which at last he endeavoured to do,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:52279:80"/>
that he might creep the nimbler away; but
whether he would or no, the Toad stuck in
his Throat; yet, at last, when with much-a-do,
he had shaken him out, he could not shut
his Mouth, but continued gaping, in an ugly
Posture, till we had killed him. Such a Staff,
if we may believe <hi>Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>y,</hi> hath a kind of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
Vertue to help Child-bearing-Women in
the Time of their Labour.</p>
               <p>But, for my Part, I was not content with
the native Animals of that Country, but fill'd
my House with Outlandish Ones too; and
my Family busied themselves, by my order,
to both our mutual Contents, in feeding
them, that we might the better bear the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
from our own Country: For seeing we
were debarred of Human Society, what bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Conversation could we have to drive Grief
out of our Minds, than among Wild Beasts?
otherwise Stones, Walls and Solitudes had
been but lamentable Divertisements for
us.</p>
               <p>Amongst these, Apes led the Van, which
making us good Sport, occasioned great Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
amongst us, and therefore you should sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
see them without a whole Ring of my
People about them, delighting to observe
their Antick Tricks and Gestures. I also bred
up some Wolves, some Bears, some broad-horned
Stags (miscalled vulgarly, Bucks) and
common Deer, also Hinds, Lynx's, Ichneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
or <hi>Indian</hi> Rats, Weasils of that sort
which you call Ferrets and Fairys: And if
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:52279:80"/>
you would know all, I kept also an Hog,
whose noysome Smell was wholsome for my
Horses, as my Grooms perswaded me: So
that in my Nomenclature of other Creatures,
'tis not fit I should omit my Hog, which made
my House to be mightily frequented by the <hi>Asiaticks:</hi>
They came thick and three-fold to see
that Creature, which is counted Unclean by
them, and by the Books of their Religion
they are forbid to eat it, so that it being a
prohibited Animal among them, they never
saw one before. Yea, all <hi>Turks</hi> are as much
afraid to touch an Hog, as Christians are to
come near to those who are infected with the
Plague. This Humour of theirs being known,
we put a pretty Trick upon them; when any
Body had a mind to send me a secret Message,
that he would not have my <hi>Chiaux</hi> know of,
he would include it in a little Bag, together
with a Roasting-Pig, and sending it by a
youth: When my <hi>Chiaux</hi> met him, he would
ask, What he had there? Then the Boy,
being instructed before, would whisper him
in the Ear, and say, That a Friend of mine
had sent me a Roasting-Pig, for a Present:
The <hi>Chiaux</hi> thereupon would punch the Bag
with his Stick, to see whether the Boy spake
Truth or no; and when he heard the Pig
grunt, he would run back as far as ever he
could, saying, <hi>Get thee in with thy nasty Present.</hi>
Then spitting on the Ground, and turning to
his Fellows, he would say; <hi>'Tis strange to see
how these Christians do dote on this filthy impure
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:52279:81"/>
Beast, they cannot forbear eating of it tho' their
Lives lay at stake.</hi> Thus he was handsomely
chouzed, and the Boy brought me what se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Message was sent me. I keep also a great
many sorts of Birds, as Eagles, Jack-daws,
Muscovy Ducks, Balearick Cranes, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges;
yea, my House is so full of them,
that if a Painter were to draw it, he may
take from thence the Copy for <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark.
Besides the Delight that I and my Family take
in these Creatures, to counterpoize our long
Absence from our own Country, I got also
this Advantage by them, That now I know,
by Experience, what I could hardly believe
when I read it in Books. You know a great
many Books are full of printed Stories, what
ardent Love some wild Beasts have to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:
I could never give Credit to such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
but looked upon them as Romances,
'till I saw with my Eyes, a Lynx, which I got
out of <hi>Assyria,</hi> so passionately affected towards
one of my Servants, though known to him but
a little while before, that for my part I could
not deny but he was in Love with him: For
whenever he was present, she would mightily
fawn upon him, and in a manner embrace him,
and almost kiss him; whenever he was about
to go away from him, he would gently lay his
Claws on his Cloaths, as labouring to retain
him; and when he was gone he would Eye
him; and whensoever he was in Sight, and
would hardly ever remove his Eye from that
Quarter; during the Time of his Absence he
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:52279:81"/>
was very sad, but upon his Return he would
skip and be jocund; he could not endure he
should be any Time absent, for one Time,
when he went with me beyond Sea, to the
<hi>Turkish</hi> Camp, the Lynx pined away by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
would not eat a bit, but at length
dyed.</p>
               <p>I was troubled for his Loss, for I had design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, with another choice Ichneumon (which
I had) as a Present for my Master <hi>Caesar,</hi> and
the rather, because of the exceeding Beauty
of his Skin, which made him look quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing from other Lynxes: The best of the
kind are bred in <hi>Assyria,</hi> from whence this
came, and their Skins are sold here for Fifteen
or Sixteen Crowns of Gold apiece. I questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
not, but these were the <hi>Babilonians</hi> Pells or
Skins, so much famed and valued amongst the
Ancients, of which mention is made in Law-Books;
in the Title of <hi>Publicans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you please to hear me, Ile tell you another
Story of a Bird: I have among my other Birds,
a <hi>Baleavic</hi> Crane, which differs from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
sort of Cranes by a white Plume of
Feathers, that grows hanging down from both
his Ears; and besides, all the fore-part of her
Neck-Feathers were black, and the <hi>Turks</hi>
adorn their Turbants with it; and there is
some difference in their Bigness. This <hi>Bale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avic</hi>
Bird was mightily affected with a <hi>Spanish</hi>
Soldier, whom I had redeemed out of his
Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns; when he walked abroad the Bird would
walk abroad with him, though for many
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:52279:82"/>
Hours together; when he stood still, so did the
Crane; when he sat down she would stand
by him, and suffer him to handle her, and
stroke down her Feathers, whereas she would
not suffer any Body else so much as to touch
her; whenever he was gone from Home, she
would come to his Chamber-door and knock
against it with her Beak; if any Body open<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d
It, she would look all-a-bout, to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he were in the Room; and not finding
him, she would traverse it about, making such
a shrill Din and Noise, that nothing living
could endure it; so that we were forced to
shut her up, that her Noise might not offend
us. But when he returned, as soon as ever
she fixed her Eyes on him, she would make to
him, clapping her Wings with such an Antick
Posture of her Body as Dancers in a Jig use
to do; or as if she had been to prepare her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for a Combat with a Pygmy. In fine, she
at last used to lye under his Bed at Night,
where she laid him an Egg. Thus I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the Story of the Loves of Brute Animals
towards Man, now prepare your Ears for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Story of a contrary import, <hi>viz.</hi> the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
and Ingratitude of another Bruit towards
Man. I had an Hart, that lived very quiet
and tame with me for many Months, but when
her rutting or coupling Time came, she grew
on a suddain so wild, that forgetting all our
respects, she flew upon every Body that she
met, as if she would have killed them with
her Horns, so that we were compelled, for
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:52279:82"/>
our own Security, to hamper her, and so
shut her up in a walled Place; but one Night,
she broke from her Prison, and run amongst
all the Horses, which, as I told you, in <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky,</hi>
use to stand all Night in the Yard, and
where she made such a Tumult amongst them,
that she forced the Grooms to drive her
to her Hold; she wounded many of them,
which set them into a Rage, so that at last they
drove her into a large Stable, and there I
gave them leave, with what Weapons came
next to hand, to destroy her: She defended
her self stoutly at first, but they being Forty
to one, at last felled her, and made her pay
for her Breach of Hospitality. When she was
dead I cut her in Pieces, and made a Feast for
the Embassadors that then resided at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople;</hi>
'twas a Hart or Stag, of a huge Bulk,
such as use to come in the beginning of <hi>Antumn,</hi>
out of <hi>Hungary</hi> into <hi>Austria,</hi> at Rutting Times;
I bought him of some Beggars, that made a
Gain of that Trade; they used to carry him
about, and where they ask'd Alms for God's
sake, at the Name of God they used to bow
their Heads, and the Stag by Custom had learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to do so too, so that the Vulgar did admire
the Beast, as if he had some Sense of a Deity,
and therefore he got a deal of Gain to his
Keepers: This Stag, by reason of his Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
I also designed as a Present for <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:52279:83"/>Having made mention of <hi>Turkish</hi> Beggars,
give me leave to acquaint you with the nature
of those kind of People in this Country.
There are fewer Beggars here than amongst us,
and they are commonly Pilgrims that travel
up and down, pretending some appearance of
Piety or religious Profession; some of them,
besides their Poverty, pretend Distraction and
Simplicity; and this sort is very much esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
among them, for the <hi>Turks</hi> count all Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Fools to be certainly designed for
Heaven; and therefore they look upon them
as Demi-Gods here on Earth. Some of those
Wanderers are <hi>Arabians,</hi> who carry Banners
before them, wherewith, as they say, their
Ancestors fought against the Christians, for
the Propagation of the <hi>Mussulman</hi> Religion:
They that are of this Rank are not ordinary
Beggars, neither do they ask Alms of all Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers,
but in the Evening they offer you a
Tallow Candle, a Lemon or a Pomegranate,
and force it upon you, but you must give
them double or treble the Worth; and by this
means they seem rather to sell than to receive
<hi>gratis.</hi> For the rest, they which beg amongst
Christians are set to do servile Offices amongst
the <hi>Turks;</hi> if a Slave become lame, yet his
Master is bound to maintain him, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riest
Cripple amongst them yet brings in his
Master some Profit. I remember, once I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
a <hi>Spanish</hi> Officer, bought by a <hi>Turk,</hi>
who was maimed in all his Limbs, by reason
of his Wounds, and yet his Master found
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:52279:83"/>
means how to make him get his Living; he
sent him over into <hi>Asia,</hi> to look to the Flocks
of Geese which he kept there; and by his
care in feeding them, he brought in sufficient
Gain to his Master.</p>
               <p>Now we talk of Slaves, give me leave to
digress a little, and to propound a <hi>Quaere,</hi>
Whether he did well or ill with <hi>Christendom,</hi>
who first abridged the use of Slaves among
them? I know there are many Inconveniencies
that attend the Condition of <hi>Slaves,</hi> but they
are over-balanced by the Advantages accruing
thereby; especially if a just and merciful
Slavery were allowed by some publick Law, as
was of old among the <hi>Romans;</hi> for then, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
we should not need so many Gallows's
and Gibbets as we have among us, to restrain
those, who set an high Price on their Life and
Liberty; to maintain which, their Poverty
prompts them to the most audacious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.
Liberty, without an Estate to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it, is none of the best Counsellors. All
Men are not able to bear Poverty and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
Mankind, in general, is not so form'd
by Nature, as to be able rightly to govern
himself; No, he stands in need of a better
and wiser Conduct than his own; otherwise,
there will be no end of this Transgressing;
for so some Beasts will always be terrible to
Men, unless their Fierceness be restrain'd by
Manacles and Bonds. But in this case of
Slavery, the weaker Mind of the Slave is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
and esteer'd by the Authority of his
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:52279:84"/>
Patron or Master; and, on the other side,
the Master is maintained by the labour of his
Slave. The truth is, both publickly and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately,
the <hi>Turks</hi> make a very great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of their Slaves; if any Houshold-work
be to be done, the Slave is ready to perform
it; and, therefore, they have a Proverb a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, <hi>He can never be Poor, that hath
but one Slave.</hi> But then for Works without
Door, if there be any Rubbish to be carried
out, or Preparation made for any great
Building, the assiduity of Slaves quickly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
what is enjoined them. This I take to
be one Reason, why our present Buildings do
not arrive to the magnificence of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents;
we want Hands (of Slaves) to carry
on the Work. I might instance also, that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
Hands and Heads have been great helps to
the Learned, to attain their so much celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Learning and Knowledge. What I have
hitherto discoursed about Slaves, you will look
upon as a Divertisement; and so, pray, take
it.</p>
               <p>This I can assure you of, That the <hi>Turks,</hi> in
their way, do make an huge Advantage of
Slaves; for if an ordinary <hi>Turk</hi> bring home
one or two Slaves, whom he hath taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
in War, he accounts he hath made a
good Campaign of it, and his Prize is worth
his Labour. An ordinary Slave is sold among
them for 40 or 50 Crowns; but if he be
young, beautiful, and have skill in some
Trade besides, then they rate him at twice as
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:52279:84"/>
much: By this you may know, how advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
the <hi>Turkish</hi> Depredations are to them,
when many times, from one Expedition, they
bring home five or six thousand Prisoners.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> of old were not ignorant of
this gainful Trade; which made them set an
high Rate on 20 or 30 thousand Persons,
which they sometimes took at the sacking of
Cities, as their Writings shew. But a <hi>Turk,</hi>
upon the like Sack, would make ten times
five hundred Crowns of his Prize, tho' by
the Rules of their Religion they are not to
make Slaves of any of their own Sect; nor to
disfranchize them, or set any Price on their
Heads.</p>
               <p>But to return from this large Digression.
I formerly acquainted you with my Sport in
<hi>Huming;</hi> it follows, in course, that I must
say something of my <hi>Fowling.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> are
favourable to all Beasts, as also to Birds;
and especially to Kites, because, they say,
they eat up the Carrion, and keep the Streets
clean and wholsome; and, therefore, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of these Birds fly up and down the
Town, as fearless of Gin or Snare, so that
they are almost tame; and when you whistle
to them, they come about you, throw them
up Meat in the Air, they'll catch it with their
Claws. Once I caused a <hi>Mutton</hi> to be killed,
and called the Kites to prey upon the Entrals;
I cut them in pieces, and threw them up into
the Air, by and by come ten or twelve or
twenty Kites, and a while after so many of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:52279:85"/>
them, that they almost shaded the House;
and they are so bold, withal, that if you hold
out a piece of Flesh, they will be ready to
snatch it out of your Hands. In the mean
time, I stand with my Cross-Bow behind the
Pillar, and sometimes when I shot, I made the
Tail or Feathers of one or other of them to
fly off, and sometimes I gave one or two a
mortal Wound, and made them tumble down;
but this I did privately, when the Doors were
shut, that so I might not provoke the <hi>Turks</hi>
to Indignation.</p>
               <p>I must tell you, I have <hi>Partridges</hi> too (to
acquaint you with my whole Stock of pleasur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Recreations.) You would wonder, as I
my self did at first, how tame they are. They
were brought from <hi>Chios</hi> with red Feet and
Beaks; they were so troublesome to me, by
standing at my Feet and picking out the Dust
out of my Velvet Pantofel, with their Beaks,
that they might dust themselves therewith,
that to be rid of the Molestation, I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to shut them up in a Chamber, where,
in a short time, they grew over-fat and dyed,
as my Servants told me; yet <hi>Pliny</hi> says, in a
certain Place, That <hi>Hares</hi> and <hi>Partridges</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
grow fat. You have yet but a small
ground for your Wonderment; but, pray,
prepare your Ears for what follows.</p>
               <p>The Isle of <hi>Chios</hi> is full of these Birds, and
they live with the Inhabitants in their
Houses; every Country-man, almost, keeps
more or less of them under his Roof, as their
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:52279:85"/>
Estates are, or their Minds serve them. A
publick Keeper whistles them out in a Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and they run to him into the High-way,
and follow him into the Field, (as Flocks of
Sheep do their Shepherds with us;) there
they stay all Day to feed and bask themselves,
and in the Evening he whistles for them again,
and then they covy together again, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to their old Lodgings. The Custom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose
from hence, as they say: Assoon as ever
the Partridges are hatch'd, the Country-men
take them up and put them in their Bosoms,
betwe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> their Skin and their Shirts; thus
they carry them about a day or two, ever
and annon moistning their Mouths with their
own Spittle. This Courtesy doth so oblige
the young Birds, (as Partridges, as well as
other Birds, are mindful of human Civilities,
if I may so speak) that they cannot forget
their Fosterers; and yet care is to be taken,
that they stay not out in the Field all Night,
if they do so two or three times, they quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forget human Hospitality, and return to
their own natural free Life in the open Field.
I have taken a great deal of Pains to procure
such a Fosterer of Partridges to send him
to <hi>Caesar,</hi> to teach Emperors that Aviary dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.
'Tis true, I never saw this done
with my own Eyes, yet so many creditable
Witnesses have affirm'd the Truth thereof,
that I believe it as well as if I had seen it.
And I give equal Credit to the Story, I am
now about to tell you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:52279:86"/>
It is so known a Truth in this Country, that

from <hi>Egypt,</hi> (as many do continually) do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it for certain, That Chicken are not
hatched, as with us, by an Hen sitting abrood
upon them, but there are some appointed
Officers, that in Spring time, gather all the
Eggs of the Neighbourhood and put them in
a certain kind of Oven, which they make of

not by Tale, for that would be too tedious,
but by Admeasurement. I mention this the
rather, because I read of such a Passage in
<hi>Vopiscus;</hi> where the Emperor <hi>Adrian,</hi> being
angry with the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> inveighs against
them with this Sarcasm; <hi>I wish them,</hi> says he,
<hi>no greater Curse, than they may always feed on

                     </gap>aam'd to tell.</hi> So that without Question,
this was an old Custom among the <hi>Egyptians,</hi>
and, therefore, <hi>Adrian</hi> upbraided them with
their Food, which he looked upon as obscene,
being begotten by Dung and Dirt. You may
think, perhaps, that I am mistaken, but I
leave the Matter with you, and shall now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
to acquaint you, with the rest of my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisements.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:52279:86"/>
Be pleased then to know, That I have also
a Breed of brave Horses; some from <hi>Syria,</hi>
others from <hi>Cilicia, Arabia, Cappadocia,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with divers Camels, Sumpture horses,
and all Utensils fit for a Journy. For I
would have the <hi>Turks</hi> believe, that I have now
executed all my Masters Commands, and wait
only for my dismission to return home, which
I press with great Importunity, knowing that
by reason of the present Discord among them,
and the War between the two Brothers, I
may obtain the better Conditions of Peace
from them.</p>
               <p>As I take Pleasure in my Horses an other
accounts, so especially when in an Evening
I behold them brought one by one, out of
their Stables, and placed in the Yard, that so
they might enjoy the Night-Air in Summer-time,
and rest more sweetly; they match out
so stately, and shaking their Mains on their
high Necks, as if they were proud to be seen;
they have Fetters on their Fore-feet, and one
of their hinder Feet is tyed with a Cord to a
Stake</p>
               <p>There is no Creature so gentle as a <hi>Turkish</hi>
Horse; nor more respectful to his Master, or
the Groom that dresses him. The reason is,
because they treat their Horses with great
Lenety. I my self saw, when I was in <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
passing through a part of <hi>Bithinia,</hi> called
<hi>Axilos,</hi> towards <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> how indulgent
the Country-men were to young Colts, and
how kindly they used them soon after they
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:52279:87"/>
were folded, they would stroke them, bring
them into their Parlors, and almost to their
Tables, and use them even like Children;
they hung something about their Necks, like
a Jewel, even a Garter which was full of Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
against Poyson, which they are most afraid
of; and the Grooms, that are to dress them,
are as indulgent as their Masters; they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
sleek them down with their Hands,
and never use any Cudgel to bang their
Sides, but in cases of great necessity. This
makes their Horses great Lovers of Mankind;
and they are so far from kicking, win<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing,
or growing untractable by this gentle usage,
that you shall hardly find such a masterless
Horse among them.</p>
               <p>But alas, our Christian-Grooms treat Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
at another-guess rate; they never think
them rightly curried, till they thunder at
them with their Voice, and let their Club or
Horse-whip, as it were, dwell on their Sides.
This makes some Horses even to tremble
when their Keepers come into the Stable, so
that they hate them and fear them too. But
the <hi>Turks</hi> love to have their Horses very gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
that at a word of Command they may
fall down on their Knees, and in this posture
receive their Riders.</p>
               <p>They will take up a Staff or Club upon the
Road, which their Rider hath let fall, with
their Teeth, and hold it up to him again;
and when they are perfect in this Lesson, then
for their Credit they have Rings of Silver
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:52279:87"/>
hung on their Nostrils, as a Badge of Honour
and good Discipline. I saw some Horses,
when their Master was fallen from the Saddle,
that would stand Stock-still, without wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
a Foot, till he got up again. Another
time I saw a Groom standing at a distance, in
the midst of a whole Ring of Horses about
him, and at a word of Command they would
either go round or stand still. Once upon a
time I saw some Horses, when their Master
was at Dinner with me in an upper-Room,
did prick up their Ears to hear his Voice;
and when they did so, they neighed for
Joy.</p>
               <p>And yet this is usual and common to all
<hi>Turkish</hi> Horse, that they run forward with a
stiff and stretch'd-out Neck, so that they cannot
easily be stopp'd or hinder'd in their Course,
but by fetching a large compass about; which,
in my Judgment, is the fault of the Bri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>les
they wear, which all over <hi>Turky</hi> are of one
Make, and not contrived harsher or tenderer,
according to the Neashiness of the Horses
Mouth. I must also acquaint you, That the
<hi>Turks</hi> do not Shooe their Horses as we <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
do; our Shooes are very open in the
middle, but theirs are broad-web'd Shooes,
that so their Feet may be less endangered in
Travelling. Their Horses do also live longer
than Ours.</p>
               <p>I have seen an Horse of theirs as lusty at
20 Years old, as ours are at eight; yea, they
say, in the Stables of their Emperor, there
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:52279:88"/>
are Horses of 50 Years old; and which, for
some great Merit, are exempt from Labour,
and feed daily at the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi>'s Charge.
The <hi>Turks,</hi> in Summer-nights, when the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is hot, do not keep their Horses in their
Stables, as we do; but do cover their Backs
with Horse-cloths, and so bring them forth
into the open Air (as I told you before;) and
for Litter, they have only dry'd Horse-dung,
which they save all the Year long, and spread
under them for their Bedding: As for Straw,
they make no use of it at all, either for Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering,
or Feeding them. Their usual Food
is a little Hay, and a small quantity of Barly;
with this Meat they grow not fat, for their
Masters love lean Horses, as being fitter for
Race, and Burden, than foul-bodied ones.
They cover them with Horse cloths, both in
the Winter and Summer, only they are thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in the <hi>One</hi> than in the <hi>Other.</hi> This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
much to the smoothness of their Hair,
and is also a good relief to their chilly Horses,
which cannot endure the Cold.</p>
               <p>In those Steeds, as I lately told you, I take
a great deal of Delight; when, about Sun-set,
they are brought out of their Stables, and
placed in a row in the Yard; where I call
each Horse by his usual Name, as <hi>Arahs,
Caramanian,</hi> &amp;c. whereupon they fall a
Neighing and give a Glance of their Eyes and
stare at me. Sometimes I go down among
them, and give to each of them a piece of
Melon-rind out of my Hand, which makes
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:52279:88"/>
them know me so well. Thus you see, what
Shifts I am put to, to drive away my Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.</p>
               <p>I have also six <hi>She-camels,</hi> which I keep by
me, ready to carry my Baggage, as I pretend
to the <hi>Turks;</hi> but my true Design is, to
bring them to my Master the Emperor; if
peradventure he, with other Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
may have a Fancy to them, to breed them
because of their great use.</p>
               <p>There are two things of which the <hi>Turks</hi>
make mighty Advantage of, which are <hi>Rice</hi>
among the Fruits of the Earth, and <hi>Camels</hi>
among the Beasts of the Field, both of them
very convenient in their several Kinds, for
long Expeditions; as for <hi>Rice,</hi> it is not easily
spoil'd; it affords very wholsome Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and a little of it will serve a great many
People. And for <hi>Camels,</hi> they'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> carry huge
Burdens; they will endure Hunger and Thirst
to admiration; and also they require little
Attendance; one Keeper will keep six or eight
of them, and no Creature in the World is
more obsequious to his Owner than the <hi>Camel;</hi>
and for currying of them, they do it not with
a Curry-Comb as we do, but with Brushes,
as we do our wearing Apparel; they rather
kneel than lie down, on the naked Ground;
and in this Posture they offer themselves to be
loaded; if you lay too much on their Backs
they'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> grumble, a little, and refuse to rise, for
their Backs will be easily broken under over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great
Burdens, especially in Ways that are
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:52279:89"/>
slippery and dirty. I was mightily taken to
see them stand all round in a Ring, and with
their join'd Heads, take Water or other Food,
out of the same Bason or other Vessel, with
such agreement among them; and when Fod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is scarce, they live upon tops of Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
or Thorns; and when their Chops are
bloodied in gathering them, then they eat
them down most sweetly.</p>
               <p>The <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>thians</hi> send a great many <hi>Camels</hi> to
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> but the most part come from
<hi>China</hi> and <hi>Alsyria:</hi> From those Countries,
there are whole Droves of them; and they
are so cheap, that a <hi>Mare</hi> of a good Breed is
worth an 100 <hi>Camels;</hi> wherein, perhaps,
they respect more the scarcity of <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es</hi> than
the cheapness of <hi>Camels;</hi> for good <hi>Mares</hi> are
so scarce in that Country, that he that gets but
one, of that sort, thinks himself a very
<hi>Croesus</hi> for Wealth. They try whether they
are good or no, if they can run down a steep
Hill, and not trip nor stumble. When the
<hi>Grand Seignior</hi> goes upon a military Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
into the Field, he carries above 40000 of
these <hi>Camels</hi> with him, and as many <hi>Mules</hi> for
Burden; and these he lades with all sorts of
Victuals, especially with <hi>Rice.</hi> They also
carry Tents, Arms, and other Utensils of
War, upon them, especially when he marches
into <hi>Persia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, you must know, that the Countries
over which the <hi>Sophi,</hi> or, as the <hi>Turks</hi> call
him, <hi>Chifibas</hi> of <hi>Persia</hi> reigns, are not so
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:52279:89"/>
fruitful of Provisions, as our <hi>European</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
are. The Reason is, because the Custom
of the Inhabitors is, upon the Approach of an
Enemy, to destroy all before them, that so Fire
and Famine might send him further off; so
that if the Invader, bring not great Store
of Provision with him, he will be in danger
of Starving; and if he once do approach his
Enemy, yet he doth not presently open his
Store of Provision, but reserve it for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat;
which, he knows, must be through those
Places already wasted by such a Multitude of
Men and Beasts, that, like Locusts, have
before pilled all the Country; then, indeed,
the <hi>Grand Seigniors</hi> Stores are opened, and
some small Allowance given out daily to the
<hi>Ianizaries</hi> and other Dependents of that
Prince, enough to keep them alive, and that
is all. As for others, it goes hard with them,
unless they have made some Provision for
themselves before-hand; and some of their
Soldiers, especially Horse, are so fore-sighted
that in Prospect of such Difficulties, they
carry a led Horse along with them, with Viands
and other things to support them, if need be.
Upon this Horse they usually carry some Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,
that they may spread abroad, as Tents,
to defend them from Sun and Rain; also some
other Cloaths to wear, and withal Two or
Three Wicker Baskets, full of the best Flower
they can get, with a small Pot for Butter,
some Spice and Salt; with these, in case of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
they kill their Hunger. They take out
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:52279:90"/>
a few Spoonfuls of their Meal or Flower, and
pour Water upon it; then they add a little
Butter, and so seasoning it with Spice and
Salt, they set it on the Fire, and when it boyls,
it swells so that it will fill a large Platter:
They eat hereof Twice or Thrice a Day, as
their Store holds out, but without eating
Bread with it, unless they have brought some
Biskets along with them: With this thin
Dyet, for want of a better, they can live a
Month or Two, till they come to richer Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
There are some of them who carry dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Beef, ground to Powder, in a kind of
Snap-sack, that's a more nutritive and a choice
Viand amongst them: And sometimes they eat
Horse Flesh, for in a vast Army a great many
Horses must needs dye, and if any of them
be more fleshy than others, that makes a great
Feast for hungry Stomachs. And they who
have thus lost their Horses, (for you must
know that too) when the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> or
<hi>Vizier</hi> removes his Camp, stand in a row be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him the Way he is to march, with their
Saddles on their Heads, signifying hereby the
loss of their Horses, and by that mute Sign
begging Relief towards buying a new one,
and their Prince gratifies them, at his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Turks</hi> surmount huge Difficulties
in War, with a great deal of Patience, Sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
and Parsimony, reserving themselves for
more favourable Circumstances. But our
<hi>Christian</hi> Soldiers carry it otherwise, they scorn
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:52279:90"/>
homely Fare in their Camps, they must have
dainty bits, forsooth, such as Thrushes,
Black-birds, and banquetting Stuff, if they
have not These they are ready to mutiny, as if
they were famished: And if they have them,
they are undone, their own Intemperance kills
them if their Enemy spare their Lives. When
I compare the Difference between <hi>their</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
and <hi>ours,</hi> I stand amazed to think What
will be the Event, for certainly <hi>their</hi> Soldiers
must needs conquer, and <hi>ours</hi> must needs be
vanquished, Both cannot stand prosperously to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
For on <hi>their</hi> side there is a mighty,
strong and wealthy Empire, great Armies, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
in War, a veterane Soldiery, a long se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of victories, Patience in Toil, Concord, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Discipline, Frugality and Vigilance. On <hi>our</hi>
side, there is public Want, private Luxury,
Strength weakned, Minds discouraged, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accustomedness
to Labour or Arms, Soldiers
refractory, Commanders covetous, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Discipline, Licentiousness, Rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Drunkenness, Gluttony, and that which
is worst of all, <hi>they</hi> use to conquer, <hi>we</hi> to be
conquered. Can any Man doubt, in this case,
what the Event will be? 'Tis only the <hi>Persian</hi>
stands between us and Ruin. The <hi>Turks</hi> would
fain be upon us, but <hi>he</hi> keeps him back; his
War with him affords us only a Respit, not a

with <hi>him,</hi> he will bring all the Power of the
East upon us, and how ready we are to receive

him, I am afraid to speak. But, to return from
whence I digressed.</p>
               <p>I told you before, That the <hi>Turks</hi> use to
carry their Arms and Tents on Horse-Back to
the War, but they are such as belong chiefly to
the <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> for the <hi>Turks</hi> are very careful
to have their Army healthy, and fenced against
the Weather, let him defend himself as well
as he can against the Enemy, that's to his own
Peril; but the Publick takes care for his
Health; hence it is, that a <hi>Turkish Army</hi> is
better cloathed than armed. They are afraid
of Cold, as of their greatest Enemy; and
therefore, even in <hi>Summer</hi>-time, they are

made of course Thread, which keeps then
very warm. And to defend them also against
the Cold and Showers, Tents are carried
about for them at the Public Charge; and
every <hi>Ianizary</hi> is allowed as much space in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that one Tent can hold Twenty five or Thirty
<hi>Ianizaries;</hi> and that thick Cloath, I spake of,
is also supplyed out of the publick Store.
When it is distributed among them, they take
this Course, to prevent Quarrels; the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

has no cause to complain. And, for the same
Reason, their Pay is weighed out, not told,
to them, lest any one should say, He was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to receive Light or Clipt Mony; nor do
they stay till the very Day of Pay, but receive
it the Day before. The Arms that are carried
are chiefly for the use of the Horse, called
<hi>Spahi's;</hi> for the <hi>Ianizaries</hi> do usually fight on
Foot with Musquets, at a distance, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when an Enemy is near, and a Battle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
the Armour is produced, but usually
such as is of an old make, and are part of the
Spoils obtained from former old Fights and
Victories: These are distributed among the
Horse; their other Armour is but a light
Buckler. You may easily think, how odly such
Armour will sit on a Man which is given out
so hastily; ones Brest-Plate is too narrow,
another Man's Helmet is too loose, another
Coat of Male is too heavy for him to bear,
every Piece hath some Fault or other, and yet
they must not complain, they count it coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so to do, for they resolve to fight, be their
Arms what they will, so great Confidence have
they in their Victories, and in the frequent use
of their Arms. Hence it is also, that they put
their old Foot on Horse-service, which they
were not used to before, for an experienced
Soldier (they say) will do valiantly, either
on Horse or Foot-service. In my Judgment,
the <hi>Old Romans</hi> were of the same Mind, and
especially <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> who was wont to say,
<hi>That his Soldiers would fight well, even though
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:52279:92"/>
they were perfumed;</hi> for when the horsed the
Ten Legions, upon a Conference he was to
have with <hi>Ariovistus,</hi> what was his Intent,
think we? but that they should fight on Horse-Back,
if there had been need, though they
were used to Foot-Service before; and we know
amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> their Foot-Service was
quite another thing from Horse-Service; but
if you say, <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Design was only to horse
his Men for Carriage, but to make use
of their Service on Foot, certainly he had
run a great Hazard thereby, if when
<hi>Ariovistus</hi>'s choice Horse were within a stone's
Cast of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and might have fallen
upon them, that then the Legion was to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
their Horses, to be disposed of, and
ranged into a <hi>Foot-Tertia,</hi> or Brigade, in an
instant: With us, this would seem very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd;
however it be, this is certain, That ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
Soldiers will manage a Fight after a
different order than we do, so the <hi>Romans</hi> did
of old, and so the <hi>Turks</hi> do at this day, with too
good Success; so much for that Subject.</p>
               <p>I return, farther to acquaint you, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent
the <hi>Turks</hi> are to all irrational Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals;
'tis true, a Dog is counted an obscene
and nasty Creature by them, and therefore
they will not harbour him in their Houses;
but they nourish a Cat as a chaster and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dester
Creature, in their Judgments: This
Custom they received from <hi>Mahomet,</hi> their
Law-giver, who was so much in love with a
Cat, that when one of them fell asleep upon
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:52279:92"/>
his Sleeve, as he was reading at a Table, and
the time of his Devotion drew near, he caused
his Sleeve to be cut off, that he might not
awake the Cat by his going to the Mosque.</p>
               <p>However, though the <hi>Turks</hi> have so ill
an Opinion of Dogs, that they wander up
and down the City of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and have
no certain Masters, so that they are Keepers
of Streets and Lanes, rather than of any certain
House, and they live upon the Off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l, which
is cast out of their Houses; yet if they see any
Bitch great with young, in their Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
they give it Bones, and some Relicks of
their Table: This they count an Office of
Pity amongst them. When, on this account,
I have blamed them for performing such Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to a <hi>Brute,</hi> which they would hardly do to
a <hi>Man,</hi> though a reasonable Creature, like
themselves, and to be sure, not to a <hi>Christian;</hi>
their answer was, That God had given Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to Man, as a Fence against all Peril, and
yet he did abuse it, so that if any Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
or Trouble hapned to him, it was his
own Fault, and therefore he deserved less
Pity: But God had bestowed no Boon on
Brutes, but some natural Notions and Appetites,
which of necessity they must obey; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were to be relieved by Man's Help
and Commiseration; and for this Reason
they take it very ill, if any Brute Creature be
put to Torment at his Death, or that Men
should take any Pleasure in tormenting them.
This had like to cost a <hi>Venetian</hi> Gold-Smith, that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:52279:93"/>
lived here, very dear, of late; the Story is worth
the Telling. This Goldsmith did de'ight in the
Art of Fowling, and among other Birds, he once
took one about the bigness of a Cuckow, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
of the same Colour; he had no great Beak,
but his Jaws were so wide and large, that, when
they were stretch'd a sunder, they did gape most
prodigiously; so that a Man's Fist might be
thrust into them; the Man wondring at this
strange kind of Bird, caus'd him to be fastned to
the upper Lintel of his Gate, with his Wings
spread abroad, and his Jaws so extended with
a Stick, that he gaped hideously: The <hi>Turks</hi>
came often by his Door, stood still, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon it, but when they saw the Bird did
move, and was alive, then taking Pity on it,
out they cryed, <hi>What an abominable thing is
this, that an harmless Bird should be so tormented?</hi>
whereupon, out they call the Man of
the House, and drew him presently, by
Head and Shoulders, to their Criminal Judge,
where Sentence was likely to be pronounced
upon him, to be soundly bastinadoed; but
the <hi>Bailo</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> (so they call their Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
or Residents there) hearing of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
sent presently one of his Servants to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the Man, and the <hi>Turkish Caddy</hi> was so
merciful as to let him go; but many of the
<hi>Turks</hi> grumbled at his Freedom. Thus the
poor Goldsmith scaped a Scouring: I laughed
heartily at the Story, for he told it me himself,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s coming often to my House, and in what a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>errible Fright he was in for the time; and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:52279:93"/>
to oblige me the more, he brought me the
Bird to look upon: 'Tis of the same Form, as
I lately described, it flies about in the Night,
and (as they say) will suck Milch Kine, so
that I am apt to believe 'tis the Goat-Sucker
of the Ancients. Such Commiseration do the
<hi>Turks</hi> use towards all sorts of Brute Animals,
especially toward the Winged kind.</p>
               <p>Over against my Lodging there is a tall
<hi>Plane tree,</hi> whose spreading Boughs make
a Delight some Shade; under that Tree
sometimes Fowlers sit with abundance of such
Birds to sell in Cages; you shall have the
<hi>Turks</hi> buy several of these Birds for a small
Matter; and when they have bought them,
they'll let them fly out of their Hands; the
Bird presently flys up to the Tree, and there
she picks her Feathers, and cleanseth them
from the Filth contracted in the Cage; she
spreads abroad her Wings and Chirps. The
<hi>Turks</hi> that bought them, say, Don't you hear
how glad this Bird is, and how he gives me
Thanks for his Liberty?</p>
               <p>If this be so, you'll say, What! are the
<hi>Turks</hi> such <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> that they count all
Brutes sacred, and will eat none of their Flesh?
I say not so, but on the contrary, they'll eat
any Flesh set before them, either boyl'd or
roasted, only they count Mutton the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Meat, because Sheep are made for the
Shambles, as they say; yet they would not
have Men to make a Sport at killing of them,
as if they rejoyced in their Torment. Some
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:52279:94"/>
of them will by no means be persuaded to
kill small Birds which sing in their Fields and
Woods; nay, they think it some Injury done
them, to restrain their Liberty by Caging
them up. But all <hi>Turks</hi> are not of that Mind;
some of them keep <hi>Nightingales</hi> in their
Houses, for the Melodiousness of their Tunes,
and in Spring-time they let them out to hire,
to sing. I knew some, that carried <hi>Linnets</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
so well instructed, that if a Man shew'd
them a piece of Mony out of his Chamber,
tho' it were at a great distance from them,
yet they would fly up to fetch it; and if the
Man would not let it go, they would sit upon
his Hand, and so accompany him from one
Room to another, still pulling at the Mony;
and when they had got it, as if they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
their Errand on which they were sent,
when their Master whistled to them in the
High-way, down they would fly to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
and as a Reward for the Mony in their
Bills, he would give them a little Hemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seed.
But I shall proceed no further in such
Stories as these, lest you should think me a
second <hi>Pliny,</hi> or an <hi>Aelian,</hi> and that I were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to write an History of Animals.</p>
               <p>I proceed then to other Matters, and shall
give you an Example of the Chastity of
<hi>Turkish</hi> Women. The <hi>Turks</hi> take more Pains
to have their Wives modest than any other
Nation; and, therefore, they ordinarily
keep them close up at home, and hardly suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them to see the Sun; but if any necessity
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:52279:94"/>
calls them abroad, they go so hooded and
veil'd, as if they were Hobgoblins or Ghosts.
'Tis true, they can see Men through their
Veils or Hoods, but no part of all their
Bodies is open to Mans view; for they have
this Tradition among them, that it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for a Man to look on a Woman, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if she be young and handsome, without
desiring to enjoy her; and by that desire the
Mind is excited, and therefore they keep them
all covered. Their own Brothers have liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to see them, but their Husbands Brothers
have not the same permission. The nobler
and richer sort, when they Marry, do it with
this Condition, that their Wives shall never
set a foot out of Door; and no Person living,
either Male or Female, be the Cause what it
will, shall ever have leave to see them; no,
not their nearest Alliance, in Blood, except
only the Father and Mother, who at <hi>Easter,</hi>
(their <hi>Bairam</hi>) are permitted to see their
Daughter; and in lieu of this Strictness, if
the Wife have Parents of the better sort, and
she bring her Husband a large Dowry, the
Husband, on his part promiseth, that he
will never have any Concubines, but will keep
to her alone.</p>
               <p>In other Cases, the <hi>Turks</hi> have as many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines
as they will, besides their lawful
Wives; and the Children of both are equally
respected, and have as much Privilege one as
the other. Their Concubines they either buy,
or take them in War; and when they are
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:52279:95"/>
weary of them, may sell them in the open
Market; only if they have Children by them,
then they obtain their Liberty. This made
<hi>Roxolan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> stand upon her Terms with <hi>Solyman,</hi>
in having brought him forth a Son, when she
was a Slave, and thereby obtain'd Manumissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Hereupon she refused to submit to his
Will any longer, unless he Married her, which
he, doting for Love, wou'd do, against the
Custom of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Princes.</p>
               <p>A lawful Wife, with them, differs from a
Concubine, only upon the account of her
Dowry, which a lawful Wife hath, but a
Concubine hath not. And when once her
Dowry is assigned her, then she is a Mistress,
Governess of the House, and all the other
Women under her. And yet the Husband
hath have to lye with which of them he
please at his Choice; and when he makes
known his Pleasure to his Wife, she bids the
Maid he desires prepare himself for his Bed;
and she obeys, perhaps, more joyfully than
her Mistress commands her. Only <hi>Friday</hi>
Night, which is their <hi>Sabbath,</hi> the Wife
claims as her due, and she thinks her self
wrong'd, if her Husband defraud her thereof;
other Nights he may lie with which of his
Slaves he please.</p>
               <p>Divorces are made among them for many
Causes, which Men easily pretend; and when
a Wife is divorced, her Dowry is restored,
unless she be put away on a dishonest Account;
but Women have but few; to instance
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:52279:95"/>
some among them few, this is one, if
their Husband do not allow them due Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance;
and if they offer to abuse them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Nature, (a Crime usual among them)
then the Wife goes to the Judge, and tells
him, She can no longer endure to live with
her Husband; when he asks the Cause, they
say nothing, but pull off their Shoo from
their Feet, and turn it up and down, which
is a Sign among them of the unlawful use of
Copulation. The greatest sort among them,
that have abundance of Women, set <hi>Eunuchs</hi>
to guard them, not such as have only their
Stones taken out, but such whose Yards are
also impaired; because otherwise they think,
such as lost their Stones only may desire the
use of a Woman, tho' not for Generation,
yet for Pleasure. The great Men also have
Baths at their own Houses, wherein they and
their Women do wash, but the meaner sort
use publick Baths.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Turk</hi> hates Bodily Filth and Nastiness,
worse than Soul-Defilement; and, therefore,
they wash very often, and they never ease
themselves, by going to Stool, but they carry
Water with them for their Posteriors. But
ordinarily the VVomen bathe by themselves,
Bond and Free together; so that you shall
many times see young Maids, exceeding beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
gathered from all Parts of the VVorld,
exposed Nacked to the view of other VVomen,
who thereupon fall in Love with them, as
young Men do with us, at the sight of Virgins.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:52279:96"/>
By this you may guess, what their strict
VVatch over Females comes to, and how 'tis
not enough to avoid the Company of an adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
Man, for the <hi>Females</hi> burn in Love
one towards another; and the Pandaresses to
such refined Loves are the Baths; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
some <hi>Turks</hi> will deny their VVives the
use of their publick Baths, but they cannot do
it altogether, because their Law allows them.
But these Offences happen among the Ordinary
sort; the richer sort of Persons have Baths
at home, as I told you before.</p>
               <p>It hapned one time, that at the publick
Womens Baths, an old Woman fell in Love
with a Girl, the Daughter of a poor Man a
Citizen of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and, when neither
by Wooing nor Flattering her, she could not
obtain that of her, which her mad Affection
aim'd at, she attempted to perform an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit
almost incredible; she feign'd her self
to be a Man, changed her Habit, hired an
House near the Maids Father, and pretended
he was one of the <hi>Chia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>xes</hi> of the <hi>Grand Sieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior;</hi>
and thus by reason of his Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
she insinuated her self into the Mans Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
and after some time, acquaints
him with the desire of his Daughter. In
short, he being such a Man in a prosperous
Condition, the Matter was agreed on, a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was setled, such as they were able to
give, and a day appointed for the Marriage;
when the Ceremonies were over, and this
doughty Bridegroom went into the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:52279:96"/>
to his Spouse; after some Discourse,
and plucking off her Head-geer, she was found
to be a Woman. Whereupon the Maid runs
out, and calls up her Parents, who soon
found that they had Married her, not to
a <hi>Man</hi> but a <hi>VVoman:</hi> Whereupon, they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
the supposed Man, the next day, to the
General of the <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> who, in the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> was Governor of
the City. When she was brought before him,
he chid her soundly for her beastly Love;
What, says he, are you not asham'd, an old
Beldam as you are, to attempt so notorious a
Bestiality, and so filthy a Fact?</p>
               <p>Away, Sir, says she, you do not know the
Force of Love, and God grant you never
may. At this absurd Reply, the Governour
could scarce forbear Laughter, but command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her, presently, to be pack'd away and
drown'd in the Deep; such was the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Issue of her wild Amours. For you must
know, that the <hi>Turks</hi> make no noise when <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret</hi>
Offences are committed by them, that
they may not open the Mouths of Scandal
and Reproach; but <hi>open</hi> and <hi>manifest</hi> ones
they punish most severely. I am afraid the
Relation of that dismal Example hath grated
your Ears. I shall, therefore, now indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to make you amends, by acquainting
you with a pleasant Story, which, I believe,
will go near to make you Smile. 'Tis this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:52279:97"/>
Upon the Account of the Troubles in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi>
there came lately a Messenger to me,
with an Express from my Master, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.
The <hi>Bassa's</hi> would not let him bring
his Letters directly to me, as they were wont
to be brought, but they carried him first into
the <hi>Divan.</hi> The reason of this their unusual
Procedure, was, because they would fain
know what <hi>Caesars</hi> Letters did contain, before
they were delivered, in regard they suspected
I dealt not faithfully with them, in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
my Masters Sense, but that I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
some of his Concessions. The Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
was cunning enough for them; for,
having some Inkling of the Matter before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
he hid <hi>Caesars</hi> Letters, and only shew'd
them those that were directed to me, from
some particular Friends. Their Interpreter,
<hi>Ebrahim,</hi> a <hi>Polander</hi> by Birth, had acquainted
them before, that the Letters, that brought any
secret Commands to me, were not written in
an ordinary Character, but in a new kind of
way, called <hi>Cyphers.</hi> As they were searching
all my Letters, at last they light upon One,
that was wrote to me by a Friend of mine, a
Secretary of <hi>Burgundy. Ebrahim</hi> saw, through
the thinness of the Paper wherein 'twas writ,
some shining Letters, which were not of an
ordinary sort. O, says he, to the rest, now
I have found <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, don't you meddle with any of
the rest of the Packet, for here's the Secresy
in this. Whereupon, the <hi>Bassa's</hi> commanded
him to open, Read and Interpret it to them,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:52279:97"/>
and they all stood listning to hear the News;
but <hi>Ebrahim</hi> told them plainly, that he could
not read one Letter thereof. That's strange,
says the <hi>Bassa's,</hi> what did you never learn the
<hi>Christian</hi> Alphabet, or have you forgot it?
Says <hi>Ebrahim,</hi> this sort of Character is only
known to those who are Secretaries to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
They did not well understand him; but
however, say they, if it be so; why do'st
thou not make haste to the Secretary of the
<hi>Bailo</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> or of <hi>Florence? Ebrahim</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
makes haste to them, and shews them
the Letters; (they were writ in such a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
that a Child of ten Years old might
have read them;) but both of those Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
when they saw the Letter was super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
to me, threw it back again before they
had scarce lookt upon it; alledging, in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse,
that such kind of Letters could be read
by none, unless by him who had another Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
to unfold them. This was all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<hi>Ebrahim</hi> could get of them. Upon his
return to the <hi>Bassa's</hi> therewith, they could
not tell what in the World to do: At last,
starts up one (I could not tell his Name) say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
there is a Patriarch in Town, an old
Man, and a <hi>Christian,</hi> and, besides, a great
Scholar; if any Man living can read these
Letters, it must be he. When they came to
the Patriarch, he told them, he could not
read a Title of them, for they were not writ
in <hi>Greek, Latin, Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Chalde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> Thus
they were disappointed there also. At last,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:52279:98"/>
                  <hi>Haly Bassa</hi> runs to <hi>Rustan</hi> (otherwise a Man
not ready to jest) and says to him <hi>Cardassi,</hi>
(Brother in <hi>Turkish.</hi>) I remember, I had once
a Servant, an <hi>Italian,</hi> who was skilled in all
Letters and Tongues, I do not question about
he could have read the Letter; but, alas! he
is lately dead. At last they being at a stand
what to do, thought it best to send the Letters,
which they could make no use of, to me: I
knew all the Matter by <hi>Ebrahim</hi> beforehand,
(neither could it be kept secret;) whereupon
I began to stamp and fret that they had inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
my Letters against the Law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and in contempt of <hi>Caesar</hi> who sent
them; and, withal, I bid <hi>Ebrahim</hi> stay, and
to Morrow he should see that Letter transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the <hi>Bassa's.</hi> The next day, when
<hi>Ebrahim</hi> appeared in the Divan, they asked
of him, Whether I could read those Letter?
Read them, says he! as easily as his own
Name; and thereupon he produced some of
them translated before them, <hi>viz.</hi> what I had
a mind to discover. Whereupon, says <hi>Rustan,</hi>
this Embassador is but a young Man, and yet
we see he can understand what the old Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch
could not so much as read; without
doubt, if he live to be old, he will prove a
very <hi>Nonsuch</hi> of a Man. For that reason it
was, or perhaps some other, that a while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
having Conference with <hi>Rustan</hi> about our
Affairs, he treated me more familiarly than he
used to do, (which was a rare thing in him)
and at last he ask'd me, Why I would not
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:52279:98"/>
turn to their Religion, and to the true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God? If I would do so, he promised
me great Honour and large Reward from
their Emperor <hi>Solyman.</hi> I told him, I was
resolved to continue in that Religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I was born, and which my Master <hi>Caesar</hi> did
profess. Be it so, replayed he, but what then
will become of your Soul? I subjoined, I hope
well, for that too; whereupon he, after a
little Pause, broke forth into these Words.
'Tis true, indeed, and I am almost of your
Mind, that they who live holy and modest
Lives in this present World, shall obtain
eternal Life in the next, be they of what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
they will. That's an Heresie, that
some of the <hi>Turks</hi> have taken up, neither is
<hi>Rustan</hi> thought to be a true <hi>Mussulman</hi> in all
Points. The <hi>Turks</hi> think it a Duty, and a
Work of Piety in them, to persuade a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
they have any good Opinion of, to their
Religion; for then they think, they shall
save a Soul from Destruction, and that they
count a great Honour to themselves, and
the greatest Charity they can do another Man,
to make him a <hi>Convert</hi> to their Religion.</p>
               <p>I shall now acquaint you with the Effects of
another Conference I had with <hi>Rustan,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
you may see, what daily Feuds are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> upon the account
of Religion. He ask'd me one time, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the War did continue between <hi>Spain</hi> and
<hi>France?</hi> I told him, It did. 'Tis strange,
says he, that they should fall out that are of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:52279:99"/>
one and the same Religion: I replyed, 'tis
no otherwise between those two Princes, than
'tis betwixt <hi>You</hi> and the <hi>Persians.</hi> The Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
is not about Religion, but about Civil
Right, Provinces, Cities and Kingdoms,
which both lay claim to. You are quite mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken,
says <hi>Rustan,</hi> we are not of the same
Religion with the <hi>Persians,</hi> but do count them
a more Profane and Heathenish sort of People
than you <hi>Christians</hi> are. But to return to the
Affairs of <hi>Hungary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since my last return to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in <hi>Hungary</hi> have received a very great Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration,
it would be too tedious to describe
them particularly; and, besides, it were not
conducive to my Design. <hi>Isabella,</hi> VVife to
King <hi>Iohn,</hi> is returned into <hi>Transilvania,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with her Son, having refused the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sactions
and broken the League made with the
Emperor <hi>Ferdinand;</hi> and the <hi>Transilvanians,</hi>
terrified by the <hi>Turkish</hi> Arms, have again sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
their Necks to the Old <hi>Ottoman</hi> Yoke.
Matters succeeding thus prosperously with
the <hi>Turks,</hi> they are not therewith contented,
but grasp at all <hi>Hungary</hi> too; and, besides
other Places, they resolved to besiege <hi>Sigeth,</hi>
which signifies in the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Language, an
<hi>Island,</hi> or Place naturally very strongly situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated.
And for this purpose they chose a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
who, upon the account of the Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his Arms in former times, created
great confidence in his own Men, and struck
as much terror into his Enemy: His Name
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:52279:99"/>
was <hi>Haly Bassa,</hi> an <hi>Epirot,</hi> who had had good
Success in <hi>Hungary</hi> before, and especially in
the Battel, wherein he overthrew <hi>Sfortia
Palavicin,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Five Churches.</hi>
He was sent for from the utmost Bounds of
the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire towards <hi>Persia,</hi> and came
with a great Expectation to <hi>Constantinople:</hi>
My Collegues were yet here with me, pressing
for a dismission. 'Twas the pleasure of the
<hi>Bassa's</hi> that we should see him, in regard
we counted him, as they thought, a very
Thunder-bolt of VVar. VVhen we came to
him, he received us courteously, and made a
great Harangue to this purpose: That we
should study Peace, and rather than suffer
<hi>Hungary</hi> to be wasted with Fire and Sword,
we should accept of those Conditions, which
the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> had offered us. VVe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
him, That we desired nothing more
than Peace; provided, it might be had upon
tolerable Conditions; but those which they
offered, were against the Honour and Dignity
of our Master. Thus we took our leaves,
after he had treated us with a Cup of VVater
diluted with Sugar. This <hi>Haly</hi> was an
Eunuch, but the Constitution of his Body
did seem to add to the vigour of his Mind:
He was low of Stature, bloted in his Body, of
a Bay-coloured Countenance, a sour Look,
frowning Eyes, broad Shoulders and sticking
up, between which stood his Head, as in a
Valley. Two Teeth were prominent in his
Mouth, like Boars Tusks, his Voice hoarse;
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:52279:100"/>
in a Word, he was the <hi>Fourth Fury.</hi> The Day
after he makes great Preparation for his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
into <hi>Hungary;</hi> where having spent
some Time to provide Materials, he at last
marches against <hi>Sigeth,</hi> and beats off those
which were repairing <hi>Dabock,</hi> a Castle of
<hi>Caesar</hi>'s; but <hi>Caesar,</hi> being acquainted long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with his Design, sends <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> one of
his Three Sons, a young Man, yet comparable,
for greatness of Mind, to any of the old Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
to oppose the Torrent of <hi>Haly Bassa</hi>'s
Force, and by his Valour to retrieve Affairs in
<hi>Hungary:</hi> He had no great Force with him,
but with a select Body of Horse he faces <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>'s
Army; the <hi>Turks</hi> that were present related
to me, That 'twas a goodly Sight to behold
the Splendor, Order and Boldness of those
Forces. <hi>Haly,</hi> being naturally of a fierce Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
and having a far greater Army, was
even mad, to think, that an handful of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
should dare to look him in the Face.</p>
               <p>There was a moorish Piece of Ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
both Armies, which could not be pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
without great Danger; <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had no
need to pass it, for his Design was only to
relieve <hi>Sigeth,</hi> and to raise the Siege: But
<hi>Haly Bassa</hi> was not in the same Circumstances,
for unless he would make a base and unhansom
Retreat (as the Event afterward shewed)
'twas altogether necessay for him to do it: So
that he, seeing to what Straits he was brought,
resolved to put all upon hazard, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
he bent his Bridle, to turn his Horse
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:52279:100"/>
towards that inconvenient Place; when, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
one of the <hi>Sanziacks,</hi> that was near him,
whose Name I remember not, taking notice of
the extream Danger he was running into, leapt
from his Horse, and taking the <hi>Bassa</hi>'s Horse
by the Bridle, <hi>Sultan,</hi> says he (for so the <hi>Turks</hi>
call the great Dignitaries among them) <hi>Here
you see into what a Ieopardy you were like to cast
both your self and your whole Army; you don't
consider what an incommodious Place this Marish
is: The</hi> Christians <hi>are ready on the other side with
Arms in Hand and Courage in their Heart, to
receive us, when we are half drowned and half
covered with Mud; and thus they in good Order,
will assault us, being disordered and out of our
Ranks, and will make use of all our Imprudence,
to obtain a most assured Victory over us: Nay, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
moderate your Anger, and return to your self,
and reserve so many brave Men, with your self,
for the Service of your Prince, and for better
Times.</hi> Upon this Speech, <hi>Haly,</hi> as if he had
remembred himself, drew back; and there
was not any <hi>Turk</hi> amongst them, but was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to confess, That the whole Army was sav'd
by the Advice of that <hi>Sanziack.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When this Matter was carried to <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
though the <hi>Vizier,</hi> and the Chief <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sas</hi>
could not deny the Thing, yet they thought
it dangerous to suffer the Example of so auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
a Fact in the <hi>Sanziack</hi> to pass unpunish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
'Tis true, they did mutteringly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
both his Fidelity and his Prudence, yet
to suffer Disobedience to a superior Officer to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:52279:101"/>
pass without a Punishment, they thought it a
dangerous Case in Military Discipline, so that
he was called back to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and there
was cashiered for a Time; and when this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
was sufficiently punished, as they thought,
then they bestowed upon him as good a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
so that every Body saw <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>is Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was inflicted rather for the preservation
of the Discipline of War, than for any due

               <p>But <hi>Haly,</hi> a whil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Soul.</p>
               <p>But Arck-duke <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> on the other side,
returned to <hi>Ferdinand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> his Father, with the
deserved Laurel of Victory, having perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an Exploit, not only of great Advantage
for the present, but of much greater Benefit
to future Ages, by the exemplarity thereof;
for hereby he made the <hi>Turks</hi> to know, that
if they proceeded on to press upon <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi>
that he wanted neither able Soldiers nor
expert Commanders to chastise their Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.</p>
               <p>Yet the <hi>Turks</hi> of those Borders did not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it with any great Modesty; for while <hi>Haly</hi>
was yet encamped at <hi>Sigeth,</hi> our Men had sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Walls of <hi>Gran,</hi> and taken the City,
having a Castle near it of the same Name,
where they got a great deal of Booty, and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:52279:101"/>
carried away the Inhabitants, being most Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Children.</p>
               <p>A Messenger was sent immediately to <hi>Haly,</hi>
to acquaint him with the Loss; who coming
into his Presence, by the very Consternation
of his Countenance portended some great
Mischief to have happned to them. The <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa</hi>
presently asked him, How things went?
and what was the Cause of his great Fear?
<hi>Sir,</hi> says he, <hi>the Enemy hath taken and plundered</hi>
Gran, <hi>which great Blow occasions my Grief. A
Blow, Fool,</hi> says the <hi>Bassa, tell me of a Blow,
when I have lost my Genitals</hi> (to which he point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with his Hand) <hi>that shew me to be a Man:</hi> Thus
did he scoff at the Consternation of the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger,
and undervalued the Loss of <hi>Gran,</hi>
which was easily recoverable; not without the
Laughter of the By-standers.</p>
               <p>Moreover, in <hi>Croatia</hi> and the adjoyning
Countries, several inroads were made by both
Parties, and each side did alternately suffer
for their over-boldness and supine Security,
Let me give you an Instance, which was joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to me, and I hope will not be unpleasant
to you to hear of, though it happened some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
before the before-mentioned Passage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> at
<hi>Sigeth;</hi> but in Writing an Epistle, I do strictly
observe the Order of Time.</p>
               <p>News was brought to <hi>Rustan,</hi> from those
Parts, That a certain Confident of his, whom
he highly esteemed, and called Cousin, had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
upon a Party of <hi>Christians,</hi> as they were
celebrating a Wedding, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d being at a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:52279:102"/>
Distance, as they thought, from the <hi>Turks,</hi>
counted themselves secure; when behold this
bold and unwelcome Guest, with armed For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
came in upon them, spoiled their Mirth,
slew some, took some Prisoners, among whom
was the unfortunate Bridegroom, with his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedded
Spouse: <hi>Rustan</hi> did much rejoyce at
this Exploit, and in all Company highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
the Stratagem of his Kinsman, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
it.</p>
               <p>A pitiful Case, you will say, rather to be
lamented than related: But these are the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
Sports of insolent Fortune; yet Revenge
followed him at the Heels, <hi>Rustan</hi>'s Laughter
was soon turned to sadness: For a little while
after one of the <hi>Belies</hi> or mad Sparks, a sort
of mad Horsemen among the <hi>Turks,</hi> so called
by their outragious Boldness, came post to
him out of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and told him, That a
parcel of <hi>Turks</hi> had made an Excursion into the
Enemies Country, and had got great Booty,
but setting no bounds to their Avarice, they,
at last were encountred with a Party of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
Dragoons</hi> or <hi>Musketeers,</hi> who wofully
routed them, slew many <hi>Sanziacks,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them his <hi>Achillean</hi> Cousin, lately so
much extolled by him. This sad News made
<hi>Rustan</hi> burst forth into Tears, so that his fit
of Laughter was justly requited: But hearken
to the close of the Story, which is not unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant;
When this <hi>Dalmatian</hi> Trooper, who
brought the News, was ask'd by the <hi>Bassa,</hi> in
the <hi>Divan,</hi> How many were there of you?
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:52279:102"/>
He answered, Above Two Thousand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred:
And how many of the <hi>Christians?</hi>
I think, said he, they were not above Five
Hundred, unless there were more of them in
ambush, as we suspected. Fy for Shame, said
the fretting <hi>Bassa's,</hi> what? a just Army of
<hi>Musulmans</hi> (so they call the Men of their own
Religion) to be beat by so small a handful of
<hi>Christians,</hi> you are goodly Warriours indeed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
fit for to eat the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Bread, are you not?
The blunt Fellow, nothing dismayed, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
You are quite beside the Cushion; did I not
tell you, that we were beaten by Musketeers?
'twas the Fire defeated us, not the valour of
our Enemies; we had come off Conquerors, if
we had contested by Valour only; but who
can fight against Fire, the fiercest of Elements?
and what Mortal can stand if the very Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
fight against him? This bold Answer
of his, being as saucily pronounced, made
the By-standers ready to burst out into a
Laughter, though on this sad occasion to
them.</p>
               <p>This Matter did mightily refresh my Spirits,
which were over-grieved at the Remembrance
of the former Mis-hap of the Marriage-Feast.
This Story informs us, That our Pistols and
Carbines, which are used on Horseback, are a
great Terror to the <hi>Turks,</hi> as I hear they are
to the <hi>Persians</hi> also; for once, upon a Time,
there was a Fellow that perswaded <hi>Rustan,</hi>
when he accompanied his Prince in a War
against <hi>Persia,</hi> to arm Two hundred Horse of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:52279:103"/>
his Domesticks with Pistols: For they, said
he, will be terrible to our Enemy, and will
also do great execution upon them. <hi>Rustan</hi>
hearkned to his Councel, and furnished out a
Party, as advised; but before they had march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
half way, their Carbines or Pistols were
ever and anon out of Order, one thing or
other was broke or lost, and scarce any Body
could mend them: Hereupon this Party was
useless, and the <hi>Turks</hi> were also against this
Armature, because it was sluttish (the <hi>Turks</hi>
being much for cleanliness in War) the Troo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
Hands were black and sooty, their Cloaths
full of Spots, and their Case-boxes that hung
by their Sides made them ridiculous to their
Fellow Soldiers, who therefore jeered them,
with the Title <hi>Medica Menturi,</hi> or <hi>Mountibank
Soldiers;</hi> hereupon they apply themselves to
<hi>Rustan,</hi> complaining of this ill-favoured, use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Armour, which could do no Service against
an Enemy, and entreating to be restored to
their usual Weapons, their Bows and Arrows,
which, at their Desire, was accordingly grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them.</p>
               <p>The mention I made a while ago of things
acted in the Confine of <hi>Hungary,</hi> gives me
occasion to tell you, what the <hi>Turks</hi> think of
Duels, which amongst <hi>Christians</hi> is accounted
a singular Badge of personal Valour: There
was one <hi>Arslambey,</hi> a <hi>Sanziack,</hi> that lived in
the Frontiers of <hi>Hungary,</hi> who was very much
famed for a Robust Person; he was expert at
the Bow, no Man brandished his Sword with
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:52279:103"/>
more Strength, none was more terrible to his
Enemy; not far from him there also dwelt
one <hi>Vlybey,</hi> a <hi>Sanziack</hi> also, who was emulous
of the same praise, and thus emulation (initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
perhaps by other occasions) at length
occasioned Hatred and many bloody Combats
between them. It happened thus, <hi>Vlibey</hi> was
sent for to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> upon what occasion
I know not; when he came thither, the <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa's</hi>
had asked many Questions of him, in the
<hi>Divan,</hi> concerning other Matters, at last they
demanded how he and <hi>Arslanbey</hi> (<hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sta</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
a Lion in <hi>Turky</hi>) came to fall out? Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he makes a long Narration of the
Grudges between them, with their Causes and
Progress; and to put a fair Paint on his own
Cause, That once <hi>Arslanbey</hi> had laid an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bush,
and wounded him treacherously; Which,
said he, he need not to have done, if he
would have shewed himself worthy the Name
he bears, seeing I have often challenged him
to fight Hand to Hand, and never shunned to
meet him in the Field. The <hi>Bassa,</hi> as being
offended, thus replyed, <hi>How durst thou chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
thy Fellow Soldier to a Duel? What, was
there never a</hi> Christian <hi>to fight with? Do both
of you eat your Emperours Bread? and yet, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth,
you must go about to take away one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Lives? What Precedent had you for this?
Don't you know, that whoever of the twain had
dyed, the Emperour had lost a Subject?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
by their Command, he was haled to
Prison, where he lay pining many Months<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:52279:104"/>
and was, at last, with Difficulty, released,
yet with the loss of his Reputation.</p>
               <p>'Tis quite otherwise with us <hi>Christians;</hi> ours
do many Times draw their Swords against one
another, before ever they come in sight of a
publick Enemy (the more's the Pity!) and
count it (forsooth) a brave and honourable
Thing: What shall a Man do in such a case?
when Vice Usurps the Seat of Vertue, and
that which is worthy of Punishment is counted
Noble and Glorious. But to return,</p>
               <p>I know you are inquisitive, and therefore
give me leave to acquaint you with the Publick
Entrance, which the King of <hi>Cholcos</hi> made into
this City. His Kingdom is by the River <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi>
in a Creek or Bay of the <hi>Euxine</hi>-Sea, not
far from Mount <hi>Caucasus;</hi> his Name is <hi>Dadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus,</hi>
a Man of a tall Stature and promising
Countenance, but of a rough-hewen Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as some say. He came with a great
Train, but very Thread-bare, and sorrily
garbed. The <hi>Italians,</hi> at this Day, call the
<hi>Colchians Mingrelians:</hi> They are some of that
People inhabiting between the <hi>Caspian Gates,</hi>
(called by the <hi>Turks, Demit capi</hi> (i.e.) <hi>IronGates)</hi>
and the <hi>Portic</hi> and <hi>Haircanian</hi> Seat: They are
at this Day called <hi>Georgians,</hi> whether from
that sort of Christian Religion, which they
profess, or whether that be their ancient
Name (which seems most probable,) is not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
determined. The <hi>Albanians</hi> and <hi>Iberians</hi>
are reckoned a part of them. The Cause of
his coming is uncertain, some say, he was sent
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:52279:104"/>
for by the <hi>Turk;</hi> for when he makes Wars
upon the <hi>Persian,</hi> if the <hi>Colchians</hi> and the
People of that Tract join with him, they may
give him notable Assistance. But the vulgar
and more credible Opinion was, That he came
to desire the Assistance of some Gallies against
his Neighbour, the <hi>Iberian,</hi> who had slain his
Father, which if he could obtain, then he
would become Tributary to the <hi>Sultan.</hi> For,
you must know, that there is an old and inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
Hatred between the <hi>Colchians</hi> and the
<hi>Iberians.</hi> Once there were some Overtures of
Accommodatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> between them, and a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
was had thereupon, between great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of both Nations; at this Meeting, they
began, first, to try who should be the greatest
Drinkers; in which Contest, the <hi>Colchians</hi>
were overcome, and fell fast asleep. The
treacherous <hi>Iberians</hi> made use of this Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
and hurried away honest <hi>Dadianus,</hi>
as yet Snoring, into a Chariot, and shut him
up Prisoner in an high Tower, as if he had
been lawful Prize taken in War. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
this Injury, and to recover their King,
the <hi>Colchians</hi> levied an Army of 30000 Men,
who were commanded by the VVife of the
Captive King; a Woman of great Spirit, and
not unskill'd in Horsemanship, nor handling
of Arms. The Commanders, in this Army,
wore huge and intractable Coats of Male,
and were also armed with Swords and Spears
pointed with Iron. They had also amongst
them, a Party of Musketeers, a strange Sight
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:52279:105"/>
in that Country. As for the common Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery,
they had no other Arms but Arrows, or
Stakes burnt at one end, or great VVooden
Clubs. Thus they rode on Horseback, without
Saddle or other Furniture.</p>
               <p>This rude and discomposed Multitude, drew
near to the Place where their King was in
Custody, but were soon terrified with the
Discharge of a few Guns, from the Castle, and
run back a full Mile; but then taking Heart,
on they came again, but were repulsed with
the like Noise as before. <hi>Dadianus</hi> perceiving
help so near, did cut his Bed-cloths into a kind
of Ropes, and so let himself down by Night,
through his VVindow, and fled to his own
People; which Stratagem of their King, and
the successful Issue thereof, is highly praised
by that People, even to this very day.</p>
               <p>The Country of <hi>Colchis</hi> abounds with all
sorts of Fruits, growing almost naturally, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
Bread-Corn, VVheat and Barly, and
these Grains would grow there also, if due
Tillage were used about them; but the People
are very idle, they only sow Millet at random,
which yields such an Encrease, that one Crop
serves them for two Years; their chief Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence
is thereon, neither desire they any
other Corn. Their Vines grow at the foot
of high Trees, and mounting up to their
Boughs, yield them much VVine, and pretty
good. These Vines last for many Years.
Their Bees<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> like themselves, live in their
Woods, and supply them with Wax and Hony;
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:52279:105"/>
all the Pains they take, is, to find them out.
The same Woods yield them plenty of Veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
as for Phesants and Partridges, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
all over the Country. A great proof
of the Fertility of their Land, are their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons,
which, besides their extraordinary sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
do oft grow three Foot long.</p>
               <p>As for Coin'd Silver, they have little or
none, and of Gold less; few of them know
what it is: So that they may seem a very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
People, who are without so great a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
to Mischief. And yet I think few of
us do envy them this Happiness, because none
can grow rich among them; yet they have that
value for Silver, that when they receive any
in Traffick, with Foreigners, as some of
them must needs do, they transfer it all to the
use of their Temples, for making Crucifixes,
Chalices and such like Ornaments, which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
their King, on pretence of publick ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
doth seize upon, and hurry all to his
own use.</p>
               <p>Their only way of Commerce among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
is by Exchange of Wares; if one have
over-much of a Commodity, he brings it into
the Market, and receives what he wants in-Exchange;
so that there is no need of Money,
their Commerce is by Bartering or Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</p>
               <p>They pay also their Tribute to their King
in the Products of the Earth; they supply him
with all Necessaries largly, both for Meat and
Drink, and Apparel, for maintaining of his
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:52279:106"/>
Houshold, and for rewarding the Deserving.
And, indeed, he hath an unexhausted Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
not only from Tythes, and other <hi>Regalia,</hi>
but from those Gifts which are daily bestowed
upon him; and yet he is as liberal in bestowing
them, as he is ready to receive them.</p>
               <p>His Palace is, as a publick Granary, stored
with all manner of Provisions; which are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to all that need out of his Royal Bounty,
especially if that Years Harvest hath disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
the Husbandman. The Custom is,
that if any Merchant come with his Ship thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he makes a Present to the King, either
small or great, nothing is refused, and the
King bestows a Banquet on them a Shore.
The manner's thus.</p>
               <p>There is a large Building, on both sides of
which are the King's Stables, where a long
Table is plac'd for the King; he himself sits
at the upper end, and, at a moderate distance,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it the rest. The Table is well furnished,
especially with Venison, and with Wine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;
the largest Drinkers are the welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Guests. The Queen, with her Female At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants,
hath a Table in the same Room, but
apart by themselves; and then they junket
freely without much regard of Modesty; they
carry themselves like Anticks, fleering, nod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
whickering like so many <hi>Medea's,</hi> if
there were <hi>Iason's</hi> ready for them.</p>
               <p>After Dinner, the King, with his Guests,
goes a Hunting; and, in VVoods, under the
Shadows of large Trees, the common People
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:52279:106"/>
do disport themselves, keeping Holy-day in
Drinking, Dancing and Singing. They hang
their Fiddles on long Poles or Borders, and then
striking them with a Stick, they sing the
Praise of their Mistresses, or of their valiant
Men at the Tune. Among their Hero's (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
I am misinformed) they oft mention one
<hi>Rowland;</hi> how he came into that Country I
know not, unless he passed thither with <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi>
of <hi>Bullogn.</hi> They tell many prodigious
Stories of this <hi>Rowland,</hi> as ridiculous and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
as any <hi>Romance</hi> among us.</p>
               <p>Whilst they are thus idle and sullied, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluteness
must needs follow; and, to speak
Truth, Chastity is a rare Vertue among them.
The Husband will offer his own Wife or his
Sister, to the Pleasure of a Stranger; and if
they can but thus please their Wives, they
care for little else. Neither are their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
kept under any stricter Discipline; 'tis
hard to find a Damsel unvitiated among them;
yea, some have born Children at ten Years
old; and if you scruple to believe it, because
of the smalness of their Bodies, at your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
they will produce you such a young In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant,
not much bigger than a large Frog.
Whereas, otherwise, they are a tall and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bodied People. But they are so devoid of all
Civility and courteous Entertainment, that
they think they grace one every much among
other Barbarities, when they meet you, they
make a certain sound in their Throats like
<hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:52279:107"/>In one thing they shew a great Dexterity of
Wit, and that is in Stealing. He that pilfers
most neatly, is counted a brave Fellow; but
he that does it bunglingly, is esteemed a
Dunce and Blockhead, not worthy to live;
and even his own Father or his Son, will sell
or exchange him for a small Matter to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-strangers,
to be carried away they care
not whither.</p>
               <p>An <hi>Italian</hi> Merchant who had been in these
Parts, told me, That a certain Priest of theirs,
stole away his Knife as he was in their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
he perceived the Theft, but dissembling
it, he gave him the Sheath also, that he might
put up his stoln Ware.</p>
               <p>When they go into their Temples, they
have a good esteem for the Images of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<hi>Mary,</hi> of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul;</hi> but above all,
they venerate the Image of St. <hi>George</hi> on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
they fall down prostrate before it, kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
every part of it, even his Horses Shooes.
They say, he was a valiant Man, a great
Warrier, that in a single Combat did openly
fight Hand to Hand with the <hi>Devil,</hi> and either
conquer'd, or, at least, foil'd him.</p>
               <p>I'll acquaint you with one Passage more,
which you cannot but stand amazed at. 'Tis
this.</p>
               <p>The Princes of the East are always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
with Gifts at any Audience. <hi>Dadianus,</hi>
in complyance with this Custom, brought
<hi>Solyman</hi> a Cup or Dish of Carbuncle, so bright
and shining, that in a dark Night a Man might
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:52279:107"/>
travel by the Light thereof, as well as at
Noon-day. I cannot believe it, you'll say:
Nor do I. Neither can I be angry with you
for suspending your Belief; but whatever you
and I do, let me tell you, there are enough
that do believe it. The most Judicious think
it to be a small Goblet of <hi>Onyx</hi> or Gravale,
which was lost in Shipwrack, when a certain
Prince of <hi>Persia</hi> was flying from his Father to
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> and driven, by a Tempest, to
the <hi>Colchian</hi> Shore, where it was taken up.
He brought also 20 white <hi>Hawks,</hi> called, <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,</hi>
there being Plenty of them in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of <hi>Colchis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is all I can inform you of, concerning
the <hi>Colchians</hi> and their Manners; let me now
proceed to answer your Demands concerning
my self, and my own way of Living. I sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
go abroad, unless I receive Letters from
my Master to be delivered at the Court; or,
unless I am commanded to expostulate with
the <hi>Bassa's</hi> concerning the Rapines and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties
of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Garisons, which is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
twice or thrice a Year. Perhaps, if I
would desire leave to ride about the City with
my Keeper, it would not be denyed me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
but I have no mind to be so much beholding to
them; for I would have them to think, that
the straitness of my Confinement or Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment
is not valued at all by me; and, to
speak Truth, what Comfort can I have to
ride up and down among a Parcel of <hi>Turks,</hi>
who will either slight or else jeer, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:52279:108"/>
me? No, I like the Country and the
Campaign better, rather than that City,
which is so full of Ruins, and which retains
nothing of its ancient Glory, besides its Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
'Tis true, 'twas once a Competitress
with <hi>Rome</hi> it self, but now, alas, it is wofully
inbondaged; Who would not pity to behold
it? Who so hard-hearted, as not to be affected
with the mutability of human Affairs? And
who knows how near we are to the same Fate?
I keep my self within my own Doors, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing
with my old Friends, I mean, my
Books, in which is all my delight. 'Tis true,
for my Health sake I have made a Bowling-Alley,
where, before Dinner, I use to play;
and, after Dinner, I practise the <hi>Turkish</hi>
Bow.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> are wondrous expert at Shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Bow; they accustom themselves to
bend them from 7 or 8, to 18 or 20 Years of
Age, and hereby their Arms grow stronger,
and their Skill so great, that they will hit the
smallest Mark with their Arrows. Their
Bows are not much stronger than ours, but for
their shortness much more tractable; they are
not made of single Wood, but of a String and
Ox's Horn, fastned together with much Glew
and Flax. These sort of Bows, tho' never so
strong, the <hi>Turks,</hi> who are used to the Sport,
can easily draw even to their very Ear; and
yet one that is not accustom'd thereto, tho'
never so strong a Man, cannot draw to that
heighth, so as to strike a piece of Mony, set
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:52279:108"/>
upright between the Bow and the String, in
the Angle where it is put into the Notch.</p>
               <p>They aim their Arrows so sure, that in a
Fight they will hit a Man's very Eye, or any
other part they design to strike. In the place
where they Exercise, you may see them direct,
by their stroke so artificially, that 5 or 6 of their
Arrows will stick round about the White in
the Butt, (which is usually less than a Dollar)
and yet not hurt or touch it. They stand not
above 30 Foot from the Butt: In the Thumb
of their right Hand, they use Rings of Bone,
on which the String lies, when they draw it;
and with the Thumb of their Left Hand,
they draw the Arrow by a knot of eminent
juncture; far otherwise than they do with us.
Their Butt is made of a Bank of sandy, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velly
Earth, raised about 4 Foot high from the
Ground, and firm'd with Boards round about.
But the <hi>Bassa's,</hi> and those that have great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
do train up their Servants in this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise,
at their own Houses, where the more
skilful do teach the unexperienced. Some of
these in their common <hi>Bayram,</hi> (for they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
have their <hi>Easter</hi>) gather themselves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a great Plain about <hi>Pera,</hi> where, sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
over against one another cross Legg'd, as
Taylor's do with us, (for that is the Mode
of their sitting) they begin with Prayer (so
the <hi>Turks</hi> begin all their Enterprizes) and then
they strive, who shall shoot an Arrow fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest.
The whole Contest is managed with a
great deal of Modesty and Silence, tho' the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:52279:109"/>
number of Spectators be very great. Their
Bows are very short for this Exercise, and the
shorter the better, so that they are hardly
bendable, but by well-practised Persons:
Their Arrows also are of a peculiar kind.
He that conquers hath a Linnen-Handkerchief,
such as we use to wipe off our Sweat, wrought
with embroidered Needle-work, for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
but his greatest Encouragement, is
the Commendation and Renown he gets. 'Tis
almost incredible how far they will shoot an
Arrow; they mark the place, with a Stone,
where the furthest Arrow, for that Year, was
pitch'd. There are many such Stones in the
Field, placed there time out of Mind, which
are further than they are able to shoot now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days,
they say. These were the Marks of
their Ancestors Archery, whose Skill and
Strength, in Shooting, they acknowledge
they cannot reach to. In divers Streets and
Cross-ways of the City <hi>Constantinople,</hi> there
are also such Sports, wherein not only Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
and young Men, but even the graver <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ort
do exercise themselves in. There is one that
takes care of the Butt, who waters it every
day, otherwise it would be so dry, that an
Arrow (the <hi>Turkish</hi> Arrows being always
blunt) would not stick therein. And he that
thus oversees the Mark is very diligent to
draw out and to cleanse the Arrows, and
throw them back to the Archers, and he hath
a Stipend from them sufficient to maintain
him. The Front of the Butt bears the Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:52279:109"/>
of a little Door, whence, perhaps, was
derived the <hi>Greek</hi> Proverb; that when a Man
miss'd the Mark, he is said to shoot <hi>Extr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
januam,</hi> besides the Door; for, I suppose,
the <hi>Greeks</hi> used this way of Butting, and that
the <hi>Turks</hi> borrowed it from them. I grant
the use of the Bow is very ancient among the
<hi>Turks;</hi> but that hinders not, but when they
conquered the <hi>Grecian</hi> Cities, they might still
retain their way of Butting and Bounding their
Arrows. For no Nation scruples to transfer
the profitable Inventions of other Nations to
themselves, as I might instance in <hi>Great Ord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi>
and in <hi>Muskets,</hi> and other things, which
tho' not our Inventions, yet the <hi>Turks</hi> borrow
their use from us.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, they could never yet be brought
to the Printing of Books, nor to the setting
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>locks publick; the Reasons are, That their
Scripture (<hi>i. e.</hi>) <hi>Alchoran,</hi> would no longer
be called Scripture, or Writing, if it were
Printed, (that's their Fancy;) and for Clocks,
they suppose, that the Authority of their
<hi>Emraim,</hi> and of their ancient Rites would be
diminished, if they should permit the use of
them. In other Cases, they ascribe much to
the ancient Institutions of other Nations,
even almost to the prejudice of their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
I speak of their Commonality.</p>
               <p>All Men know how averse they are from
the approving of <hi>Christian</hi> Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies;
and, yet, let me tell you, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the <hi>Greek</hi> Priests do use, at Spring time, a
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:52279:110"/>
certain way of Consecration to open the Sea
for Saylers; before which time, they will
hardly commit their Vessels to the Waters.
The <hi>Turks</hi> also observe the same Ceremony.
For when their Vessels are ready to sail, they
repair to the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and ask them, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they have consecrated the Sea? If they
say, <hi>No,</hi> they desist; if <hi>Yea,</hi> then they set
sail and away. 'Twas also a Custom of the
<hi>Greeks</hi> not to open the Pits, in the Isle <hi>Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos,</hi>
for the digging out of the Earth, called,
<hi>Agosphrogd,</hi> before the Feast of the Transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration
of our Lord, <hi>viz. August</hi> 6. The
<hi>Turks</hi> also observe the same Custom; and,
whereas, the <hi>Grecian</hi> Priests did anciently ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate
the Liturgy at that time, the <hi>Turks</hi> will
have them do so still; and they themselves
stand at a distance as Spectators only: And if
you ask them, why they do this? Their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
is, That there are useful Customs pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
of old, the Causes whereof are not
known. The Ancients, they say, saw and
knew more than we; and, therefore, we will
not violate their Customs, lest we do it to our
Loss. This Opinion hath so far prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
some of them, that I know some, who
in private will baptize their Children, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they believe there is some good in that
Rite, and that it was not instituted, at first,
without just Cause.</p>
               <p>Having acquainted you thus far with the
<hi>Turkish</hi> Exercises, let me add one more. They
have a Custom derived from the <hi>Parthians,</hi> that
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:52279:110"/>
they counterfeit flying away on Horseback,
and presently turn back and kill their unwary
Pursuers. The way they learn to do it, is
this: They erect an high Pole, almost in plain
Ground, with a Brass-globe atop of it; about
this they spur their Horses, and having got a
little beyond, the Horse still Galloping, they
presently turn about, and flying along, shoot
an Arrow into that Globe. The frequent use
hereof makes them to expect, that their Bow
being turn'd in their sight, their unwary
Enemy is shot through.</p>
               <p>'Tis time now, you'll say, that I return to
my Lodging, lest my Keeper be angry with
me. Well then, what time is left me from
beholding these Exercises, I bestow it all on
my Books, or in Conferences with my Friends
the Citizens of <hi>Pera,</hi> originally <hi>Genoeses,</hi> or
others, yet not without the leave of my <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auxes.</hi>
These Fellows are not always in the
same Humour, they have their lucid Intervals,
and, also, sometimes, are more tractable than
at others. When 'tis fair Weather with
them, the <hi>Ragusteans,</hi> the <hi>Florentines,</hi> the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians,</hi>
and sometimes the <hi>Greeks,</hi> with other
Nations, come to visit me, on one Account
or another; sometimes, also, I converse with
Men of more remote Countries, coming hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whose Conversation doth much delight
me.</p>
               <p>A few Months ago, there came thither a
Merchant from <hi>Dantzick,</hi> who had the sole
vending of Amber: He wondred what use the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:52279:111"/>
                  <hi>Turks</hi> put so great a quantity of it, as they
bought, to; or, whither they sent it: At
last, he was resolved, That they sent it into
<hi>Persia,</hi> where that kind of Juice or Bitumen
is highly esteemed; for they adorn Parlors
Studies and Temples therewith. He bestowed
upon me, a Wooden Vessel full of that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
they call <hi>Tuppeabier.</hi> It was most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Stuff. But I laughed extraordinarily
at my Guests<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> both <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> who,
not being accustomed to this Liquor, could
not tell what to call it. At length, because I
told them, 'twas good to preserve Health,
they thought it was some Medicinal Drug, and
called it a <hi>Syrup;</hi> but they sipp'd and syrupp'd
it out so long, that, at one Dinner, they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptyed
my Barrel.</p>
               <p>This liberty my <hi>Chiauxes</hi> (who are changed
ever and anon) do sometimes give me. They
are not only willing I should go abroad, but
also do invite me so to do: But I, as I told
you before, use to refuse them, that so they
may not think they can do me either good or
hurt; and the pretence I make use of is this,
That I have tarried so long at home, that now
I am grown to the Walls of the House, so
that if I go forth, it would fall. I will not,
therefore, stir abroad, say I, till I go for
good and all into my own Country.</p>
               <p>As for my Family, I am glad that they go
abroad sometimes, for thereby they learn to
bear the Absence from their own Country,
the better.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:52279:111"/>
But yet when they make use of this liberty,
the drunken <hi>Turks</hi> do oft meet and quarrel
with them in the Streets, especially, if no
<hi>Ianizaries</hi> be with them; and tho' they be,
yet sometimes there happen Blows on both
sides: And, therefore, it is troublesome to
me, to excuse my Domesticks, when they are
clamour'd against; yet, I confess, the surly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and vigilance of my <hi>Chiauxes,</hi> in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fast my Doors, do, in great part, ease me
of that troublesome Office. Let me relate to
you a late Example of this kind.</p>
               <p>There came lately to me a Messenger from
my Master, the Emperor, one <hi>Philip Baldus,</hi>
an <hi>Italian,</hi> he was 60 Years old, and riding
faster than his Age could bear, he fell into a
Fever. My Physician prescribed him a Clyster,
and the same being brought by the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary,
my <hi>Chiaux</hi> would not let him in, nor
suffer the Physick to be brought to the sick
Man: Inhumanely enough, you'll say, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
seeing the <hi>Chiaux</hi> had carried it cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously
to me a long time; but now he was
inraged on a suddain, that twas intollerable,
for he threatned to cudgel every Body that
came to me. After he had thus affronted me,
I thought of a way to let him know, how
little I valued all his Bug-bear Threats, which
was thus. I set one of my Servants to stand
within my Gate, and to bar it; commanding
him, to open to none, but at my Command.
The <hi>Chiaux</hi> comes in the Morning to unlock
the Gate, as his Custom was, but his Key a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:52279:112"/>
not, for 'twas bolted; on the in-side
he spyed my Man, through the Chinks, and
calls out to him to open it. Not I, says he;
hereupon the <hi>Chiaux</hi> began to be angry, to
fret and to prate. Prate, while you will, says
my Servant, neither they self nor any of thine
shall come in here: For why should I open to
thee, more than thou to me? Thou keepest
us shut in, and we'll keep thee shut out; do
thou shut the Door without, and to be sure
I'll shut it within. What, says he, did your
Master command you so to do? Yes, said I:
However, says the <hi>Chiaux,</hi> let me come in and
put my Horse in the Stable: Not a jot of
Stabling for your Horse here, said he. Let
me then have some Hay and Provender out for
him: Not a bit, says he; go and buy it in
the Neighbourhood, there's enough to be
sold. I was wont to make the <hi>Chiaux</hi> to sit
down at Meat with me, or else to send him
something from my Table; but now the Case
was altered, he stood fasting as he was, at my
Door, his Horse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> being tyed to a <hi>Plane-Tree,</hi>
over against it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bassa's,</hi> and other Grandees, using to
pass by that place in their return from Court,
and knowing, by its Trapping, that it was
the <hi>Chiaux</hi>'s Horse, gnawing of Hay under
the <hi>Plane-tree,</hi> they demanded the Reason,
why he was not shut up in the Stable, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore?
He up and told them all the Matter,
that as he shut up us, so he and his Horse were
shut out, so that the one could not get Food,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:52279:112"/>
or the other Provender. When the rest of
the <hi>Bassa's</hi> heard this Story, they laugh'd
heartily, and from that time held it fruitless
to go about to terrifie me with such frivolous
Vexations as the shutting of my Doors.</p>
               <p>But a while after that <hi>Chiaux</hi> was removed,
and then we had more Liberty. <hi>Rustan</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
was satisfied how vain his Menaces were
by this Story I shall now relate.</p>
               <p>There came a certain aged <hi>Sancto,</hi> of great
Esteem among them for his Piety, to pay his
Court to him; and, among other Discourse,
he told <hi>Rustan,</hi> That seeing the <hi>Sultans</hi> Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
were at Discord one with another, which
was likely to occasion great Troubles in their
Empire, why he did not make Peace with the
<hi>German</hi> Emperor, that <hi>Solyman</hi> may be secure
from Danger on that side? I desire nothing
more, says <hi>Rustan;</hi> but how can I bring it
about? His Demands I cannot yeild to, and
my Demands he will not accept, nor can I
compel him so to do; I have tryed all ways
to bring him to my Terms, I have kept him
in the nature of a Prisoner these many Years,
I have dealt coursely enough with him; but,
alas! he is but hardned the more thereby;
when I would shut him up as close Prisoner in
his own House, then he bars his Door on the
inside, that no Body can come at him; thus
all my Labour is in vain: If another Man had
been so hardly dealt with, to avoid the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
he would have turned to our Religion;
as for him, he cares not a Rush.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:52279:113"/>
This was <hi>Rustan</hi>'s Discourse, as some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
thereat informed me.</p>
               <p>The reason of their surly carriage, is this:
The <hi>Turks</hi> are very suspicious that the Agents
of Christian Princes have a great Latitude in
their Commissions; so that they have Power
to alter, as occasion serves; if they cannot at
first get favourable, then they may except of
harder Terms. To get out of them the full
of their Commissions, they vex their Persons,
shut them up close, threaten War, and abuse
them all manner of ways.</p>
               <p>Some think, that a certain <hi>Venetian</hi> Resident
did much encourage the <hi>Turks</hi> to these Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
for when the Dispute was between the
<hi>Venetian</hi> and <hi>Turk,</hi> about <hi>Napoli di Romania,</hi>
their Agent had a Charge to try all other
ways of Accommodation, without surrend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the City; but if no milder Terms would
do, then he had liberty to part with that City,
rather than to engage in War with the Port:
Some <hi>Venetian</hi> Traytor declared this part of
his Commission to the <hi>Turks,</hi> unknown to the
Resident himself; who rather denyed that he
had any other Commands, than what he had
then propounded, which were the gentlest
Terms. The <hi>Bassa's</hi> judging themselves to be
deluded, were very angry, and bid him have
a care what he said; their Master was not to
be mock'd, they knew well enough that he
had other Commands, and thereupon, they
recited to him the full of his Commission; so
that now, said they, if you do not tell us, we
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:52279:113"/>
shall look on you as a Liar and Impostor, and
then he would be punished as such; and his
Commonwealth would certainly be ruin'd,
if the implacable Anger of <hi>Solyman</hi> did once,
on this Occasion, stir him up to War against
them; and, therefore, speak now, or for ever
hereafter, hold your Peace: Our Master will
not use Entreaties, he hath Power enough,
God be thanked, to command Obedience.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetian</hi> Agent was so surprized at this
Discourse, which he did not so much as dream
of, that he up and told them all. For which
yet, he was very much blamed in his own
Country.</p>
               <p>Ever since that time, the <hi>Turks</hi> have indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
their Suspicions, That the Christian A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
do deal but partially with them; and,
therefore, they must humble them to tell all
the Truth; upon this they imprisoned <hi>Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalic,</hi>
the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi>'s Embassador, 18
Months, and my Collegues more than three
Year, and at last sent them away, without
doing any thing. As for my self, I know
not how long I shall be kept in this durance;
for my part, I see no end thereof.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Baldus,</hi> that ancient Man of whom
I spake before, came to me, they suspected
that he had brought me new Commands,
which allowed me to yield to harder Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Peace; and they feared that I would
conceal them, because I was well aware of
their intestine Discords; so that by dealing
harshly with me, they thought to extort the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:52279:114"/>
whole truth from me. Upon the same Design
<hi>Rustan</hi> once sent me a large Gourd, called by
the <hi>Germans Wasser-plutzer;</hi> they grow very
sweet at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> their Seeds are red
within, and they came originally from <hi>Rhodes.</hi>
By this Present, sent unto me by my Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
<hi>Rustan</hi> did jestingly insinuate the fear of
a War; it was brought me when the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was very hot, and the Juice is good to
cool inward Heat. He sent this Complement
with it, That I should make use of the Fruit
fitted for the time, it would refrigerate in this
hot Season; but I should know, withal, that
a great number of those Plants did grow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Buda</hi> and <hi>Belgrade,</hi> of a much larger size
than that which he sent me, meaning thereby
<hi>Canon-Bullets.</hi> I returned Thanks for my
Present, and told him, I should make use of
it; but for <hi>Buda</hi> and <hi>Belgrade,</hi> 'twas no great
wonder they grew there, seeing there was
Plenty of them, even of a larger size at <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna.</hi>
It pleased me to let <hi>Rustan</hi> know by
my Answer, that I could return Quibble for
Quibble.</p>
               <p>But to return to the Affairs of <hi>Bajazet,</hi>
which you desired to be further informed
in.</p>
               <p>You may remember that his Father dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him some Years ago, upon this Condition,
That he should never hereafter affront his
Brother, nor raise up new Tumults in the
Empire, but should live quietly and peaceably,
as a Brother ought to do. He should remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:52279:114"/>
his Promise made to himself, and not vex
him in his old Age, if he did, wo be to him.
These Threats had weight with <hi>Bajazet,</hi> as
long as his Mother liv'd; he kept his word
rather to retain her good Will and Indulgence
towards him, than that he had any Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
either for his Brothers love or Fathers
good Will. However, quiet he was for his
Mothers sake. But two Years after her death,
looking upon himself as desperate, he cut the
Cords of all filial Obedience, and began to
resume his former Designs against his Brother,
and to execute his Animosity with greater
spight: Sometimes he laid Ambushes for his
Life; at other times he attempted it by open
force, and now and then he sent Parties of
his Men into his Brothers Province, (their
Provinces being contiguous one to the other)
and if he could catch any of his Domesticks,
he used them ill for their Masters sake; in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ine,
he left no Stone unturned, to lessen his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Credit, seeing he was not able to reach
his Life.</p>
               <p>Besides, he had several Partisans at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi>
who endeavoured to draw over the
<hi>Grand Seignior</hi>'s Guard to his side, and he did
not doubt but as his Design ripen'd, to come
privately to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and there to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scond
among his Friends, till opportunity fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
his appearance in publick. <hi>Solyman</hi>
was made acquainted with all his Designs, by
Letters from his Son <hi>Selymus,</hi> and warned him
to take care of his Life; for if he did not look
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:52279:115"/>
upon these nefarious Attempts of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> as
pointed against himself, he was much mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:
For he did not care what he did either
against God or Man, provided he might gain
the Kingdom thereby. Your Life, Sir, said
he, is aimed at as well as mine, and he would
wound you through my sides; his Design was
contrived long ago, but now he only seeks op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to execute it; and therefore, pray,
prevent his Wickedness, before you irreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilessly
be circumvented by him: As for my self,
I can easily bear all his Injuries, but the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of your danger doth more nearly concern
me.</p>
               <p>These Informations from <hi>Selymus</hi> did more
and more incense <hi>Solyman</hi> against <hi>Bajazet;</hi> so
that he put him in mind of his Duty, by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
telling him what great Clemency he had
used towards him, and what Promises he had
reciprocally made to him: Call to mind, said
he, those ancient things, 'tis not so easie for
you to get a new Pardon. Leave off wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your Brother, and creating trouble to
me: I have but a little time to live; when I
am gone, God will shew which of you shall
reign; in the mean time, don't you disturb
the publick Peace, nor the Tranquility of my
grey Hairs.</p>
               <p>But these Expostulations wrought little
with <hi>Bajazet,</hi> who was fully determin'd to do
his utmost, than to yield his Neck tamely to
his Brothers Sword; for he saw plainly that
would be his Fate, if ever <hi>Selymus</hi> mounted
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:52279:115"/>
the Throne. However, he answered his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Letters submissively enough; but his
Words and his Deeds did not agree, neither
did he intermit the prosecution of his intended
Design.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Solyman</hi> saw this, he resolved to try
another Course, and to remove his two Sons
to a greater distance one from another; and,
therefore, he commands each of them, on a
prefix'd day, to leave his Province (<hi>Chiutna</hi>
was <hi>Bajazets,</hi> and <hi>Magnetia Selymus</hi>'s) and
<hi>Bajazet</hi> to go to <hi>Amasia,</hi> and <hi>Selymus</hi> to <hi>Ico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium.</hi>
This was done, not out of any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favour
to <hi>Selymus,</hi> but only to please <hi>Bajazet,</hi>
lest he should break out into Extremes, when
he was removed from his Government, and
not his Brother from his. Withal, he laid
his Command on them, the more they were
severed by distance of Place, the more they
should be united by Concord of Mind. For
(said he) vicinity of Habitation doth oft breed
Discord betwixt Brethren, and Servants on
both sides do ill Offices to enrage and exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the Minds of their Masters one against
another; and, therefore, obey my Commands;
he that refuses, I shall count him a contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Son. <hi>Selymus</hi> immediately left his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
as being confident of his Fathers Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
But <hi>Bajazet</hi> made many Tergiversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and when he was gone a little way he
stopt his Journy, complaining that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky
Province of <hi>Amasia</hi> was allotted, as a
bad Omen; because his Brother was slain there.
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:52279:116"/>
I should rather, said he, go to any other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
besides, than where the miserable exit
of my Relations will constantly come to my
Mind, and wound my very Soul; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
he desired his Father to suffer him to
Winter at least where he was, or else in his
Brothers Province. But <hi>Solyman</hi> would grant
neither of those Requests. By this time,
<hi>Selymus</hi> was marched with an Army which
was augmented with some Forces from his
Father <hi>Solyman,</hi> (for they were both afraid of
<hi>Bajazets</hi> Plots) against his Brother, who yet
made many Halts and Delays; when, behold!
on a suddain, he fetcht a compass about, and
appeared with his Army on the rear of his
Brother, going towards <hi>Pratias,</hi> a City of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinia</hi>
over against <hi>Constantinople</hi> in the <hi>Asiatic</hi>
Shore; his Father gave consent to his March,
as not well pleased with the cautation of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet.</hi>
For, they thought thus with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that if <hi>Bajazet</hi> could win over the
Guards to himself, and march to <hi>Pratias,</hi> or
even to <hi>Constantinople</hi> it self, their Matters as
to <hi>Solyman</hi> and <hi>Selymus,</hi> would be in great
hazard; and, therefore, out of a common
fear, 'twas thought most adviseable for <hi>Sely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
to stay there, where he might expect most
Aid in case of Necessity from the vicinity of
the Capital Cities. For <hi>Selymus</hi> had not yet
Force enough to encounter his Brother in open
Field, without hopes of Success.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:52279:116"/>
When <hi>Bajazet</hi> saw his Brothers Army in
his Rear, and that he got nothing by his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,
save the certain Knowledge, that <hi>Sely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
should reign if his Father dyed, as his
Fear added to his Sickness gave some Likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
thereof; hereupon, he wrote Letters to
his Father, wherein he laid grievous things to
the Charge of his Brother <hi>Selymus,</hi> as, that
his present March did plainly declare, what
a wicked Intent he had towards his Father,
who was come <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o near the Metropolis, that
he might treacherously compass the Empire,
and that he might have but a short Passage over
if his Father dyed. But if his Father's Life
should impede his desire, then he would sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orn
some Paricide or other to take it away;
and yet this is the Son, forsooth, said he, that
you have in your Bosom, as if he were a very
Nonsuch for filial Obedience; whereas I, said
he, who never entertain'd a bad Thought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
you in all my Life, but was always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servant
of your very Becks, am rejected and
cast out of Favour; and yet the sum of my
Demands is only this, that an unlucky Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
might not be design'd for his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
To his Words he added Entreaties,
humbly beseeching his Father to gratifie him
with any other Government, either that which
his Brother left, or any other more fortunate
one than that of <hi>Amasia;</hi> and, says he, I shall
expect an Answer in the Place where I now
abide, lest if any Request be granted, I be
forced to March a great way back; but if your
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:52279:117"/>
Ears be deaf to my Request, then I will
March to what Province you shall command
me.</p>
               <p>And the truth is, <hi>Bajazet</hi> had reason to be
averse from <hi>Amasia,</hi> for 'tis a Custom among
them to build much on Auguries and ill
Omens.</p>
               <p>But these Letters were otherwise under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by <hi>Solyman,</hi> who was well acquainted
with his Sons Fears, and knew that he affected
a Government not so remote, but nearer to
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> that thereby he might have the
better opportunity for Innovations.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Bajazet</hi> made one Excuse after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for his Delay, and seemed to retard his
Fathers Pleasure; he listed Soldiers, increased
his Army, rais'd Mony, and provided all
things necessary for his own defence, and the
Conquest of his Brother. <hi>Solyman</hi> looked upon
his Design against himself, yet the crafty old
Man dissembled it what he could. For he was
unwilling to make <hi>Bajazet</hi> quite and clean de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate.
He was now grieved that the Eyes
of all Nations were fix'd on that Dissention
between his Sons, and therefore he design'd to
use some Delay, that the Matter, if possible,
might be composed with as little noise as
might be. And, therefore, he answered <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet</hi>'s
Letters mildly, telling him. That as
for the change of Provinces, he was fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to be obey'd therein; and, therefore,
he and his Brother would do well immediately
to repair to their respective Armies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:52279:117"/>
As for other Concerns, he need not take
care of them, for he himself would so order
Matters, that neither his Brother nor he should
have any Cause to complain. <hi>Solyman</hi> chose
<hi>Perian,</hi> the Fourth Vizier <hi>Bassa,</hi> to carry those
Letters to <hi>Bajazet;</hi> and that he might seem
to deal impartially between them both, he
sent <hi>Mehemet,</hi> the Third Vizier <hi>Bassa,</hi> to <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lymus.</hi>
He also laid a Charge on both those
<hi>Bassa's,</hi> not to stir a jot from either of his
Sons, till they had both entred on their respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Governments; which was wisely done
by <hi>Solyman</hi> to leave such faithfull Monitors
with his Children, which would daily put them
in mind of their Duties.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, <hi>Selymus</hi> did willingly admit
his Fathers <hi>Bassa,</hi> but <hi>Bajazet,</hi> whose Mind was
wholly set upon imbroiling the State, could
not endure to have one of his Fathers Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors
obtruded upon him, to be a Witness of
his Designs, and to be a Tell tale to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And, therefore, he dismissed the <hi>Bassa,</hi>
who was willing to have staid, having first
courteously treated and presented him with
Gifts, according to his present Ability; and
he did it with this pretence, that he had none
else to represent his Cause impartially to his
Father, but only himself; and, if he would
do him so good Offices, he promised not to be
ungrateful to him. He wish'd him also to tell
his Father, that his Commands should always
be to him as a Law, but that he was forc'd to
do what he did, for fear of his Brother <hi>Sely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:52279:118"/>
whose Injuries and Affronts he could no
longer endure. By this Message of <hi>Pertan,
Solyman</hi> was assured of <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s Design, tho'
to colour the Matter, and to put a blind on
his Fathers Embassy, he pretended he would
hasten to <hi>Amasia.</hi> However, <hi>Solyman</hi> was
not slow in his Preparations against <hi>Bajazet,</hi>
for he commanded the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> of <hi>Asia,</hi> tho'
sick of the Gout, to assist his Son <hi>Selymus</hi> with
a Body of Horse, and he sent also the most
Faithful of his Guards to accompany <hi>Mehemet
Bassa,</hi> (who was also return'd from his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassies)
into <hi>Asia</hi> on the same Errand; and
he himself pretended he would gird on his
Sword and follow them. But, alas! the
Guards shew'd themselves very unwilling to
the Service; for they abominated the War
betwixt Brothers, as an impious thing. For
against whom should they draw their Sword?
Was not <hi>Bajazet</hi> Heir of the Crown too?
This unnecessary Discussion (said they) may
be compos'd without Blood, neither are we
to be forc'd to sheath our Swords in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Bowels: As for <hi>Bajazet,</hi> he is forced to
do what he doth, in a way of Self-preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>When these Rumours came to <hi>Solyman</hi>'s
Ears, he sent for the <hi>Mufti</hi> (the High Priest
of the <hi>Turks</hi>) from whom, as from an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
they expect Answers to their Doubts,
and propounds a Case to him in these
Terms.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:52279:118"/>
                  <q>How them Men ought to be dealt with,
who durst disturb the Peace of the Empire,
by taking of Towns, and raising both of
Men and Mony, while he was alive: As
also what he thought of those, who were
assistant to him in that Design, and fought
under his Ensigns; and, lastly, what was
to be done with those who refus'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
against him, but rather justified his
Practises?</q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Mufti</hi>'s Answer was, <q>That such a
Person with all his Followers were worthy
of Death; and they that refused to Fight
against him were to be abominated, as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
and Deserters of their Religion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Answer was divulged among the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty,
and by the Chief of the <hi>Chiauxes</hi>
was transmitted to <hi>Bajazet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A while after there came a <hi>Chiaux</hi> to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi>
who had been sent by <hi>Solyman</hi> to
<hi>Selymus,</hi> but had been intercepted by <hi>Bajazet;</hi>
by whom he sent a Message to their Father, to
this effect; That he would never fail in
expressing his Duty to his Father, and that he
never took up Arms against him, but was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to be obedient to him in all things.
The Dispute was only between his Brother
and himself, who sought his Life, so that he
must fall by his Brothers Sword, or his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ther by his. This difference might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided
in his Fathers Life, and, therefore, he
desired him not to interpose or assist his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but to carry himself in an exact Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality;
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:52279:119"/>
but if (said he) you pass over into
<hi>Asia,</hi> (as Report says you will) to assist <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lymus,</hi>
don't you think, I shall be speedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced;
for I know whither to retreat; and,
let me tell you, the first day you set foot in
<hi>Asia,</hi> I will destroy all by Fire and Sword,
and will make it as desolate, as ever <hi>Tamerlin</hi>
or the War of our Enemies ever did.</p>
               <p>When this Message was delivered to <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
it did much disturb him, especially when
word was brought to him, that the Town of
<hi>Arvar,</hi> which <hi>Selymus,</hi> his Son, was <hi>Sanziack</hi>
of, was taken by <hi>Bajazet;</hi> and after he had
exacted a great Sum of Mony from them, had
plundered and sack'd it notwithstanding.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Selymus,</hi> when he heard that his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
march'd towards <hi>Amasia,</hi> and was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
come as far as <hi>Hucyras,</hi> being now
freed form the suspicion of Treachery, which
he fear'd, march'd also himself towards <hi>Ico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi>
wherein he had put a Garrison till his
arrived.</p>
               <p>'Twas none of the least of <hi>Solyman</hi>'s cares,
which distracted his Mind, lest <hi>Bajazet</hi> should
seize on <hi>Iconium,</hi> and so march into <hi>Syria,</hi>
from whence there is a large Passage into
<hi>Egypt,</hi> a Province not fully setled in Subjection
to the <hi>Turks,</hi> and not forgetting the ancient
Governors of the <hi>Circassians</hi> or <hi>Marncasses,</hi>
longed for a change. And if <hi>Bajazet</hi> once
got thither, he foresaw it would be a very
hard Matter to beat him out, should the
neighbouring <hi>Arabians</hi> assist him; who, in
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:52279:119"/>
hopes of Booty, were ready to take any side.
And if with much ado, he could have been
driven out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> yet from thence he might
easily be wafted over into any of the <hi>Christian</hi>
Countries; whereupon <hi>Solyman,</hi> by all means,
sought to stop his March thither, (because he
thought it would be <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s last Shift) and
to that end he had written to most of the
Governors of lesser <hi>Asia,</hi> to be watchful and
to assist <hi>Selymus,</hi> when he called for their Aid.
And accordingly <hi>Solyman</hi>'s Army forced a Camp
before the Walls of <hi>Iconium.</hi> For he thought
it best to be slain there, than wait for the
Auxiliaries of his Father, and not to hazard
his <hi>All</hi> on the doubtful Issue of a Battel.</p>
               <p>On the other side, <hi>Bajazet</hi> knowing what a
hazardous Enterprize he had undertaken, was
as vigorous to support his Cause; he hired a
great Body of Horse, called <hi>Chiarts,</hi> perhaps
formerly <hi>Gordianes,</hi> Men noted for Valour,
in whom he put great Confidence.</p>
               <p>They, assoon as ever they came into his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
began the representation of a Battel on
Horseback, which had so much of Truth in
it, that many of them were slain, but more
wounded. His Camp was pitch'd in the plain
and open Fields of <hi>Aucyra,</hi> from which City
he was supplied with many Necessaries, and at
the Castle thereof he placed his Concubines
and Children. From those Merchants, that
were Rich, he borrowed Mony, upon Terms
of Re-payment with Interest, if God gave
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:52279:120"/>
him Success. Form thence, also, he was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with Arms for his Soldiers.</p>
               <p>Besides his own Family (consisting of very
many among the higher sort of <hi>Turks)</hi> and
the <hi>Chiauxes</hi> before mentioned, those that
were of his Mothers or his Sisters, and of
<hi>Rustan</hi>'s Faction, came in to him; so did very
many of <hi>Mustapha</hi>'s and <hi>Achmet</hi>'s Favourites,
fierce and skilful Warriers; for they grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the undeserved Death of their Master,
were resolved to revenge them with the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
of their Blood; some also came under his
Banner out of Commiseration of his depressed
Condition, as being necessiated to fly to Arms,
his last and only Refuge.</p>
               <p>A great many favoured <hi>Bajazet,</hi> because he
was so like his Father, whereas <hi>Selymus</hi> had
not one Feature in his Face resembling him.
'Tis true, he was very like his Mother, a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
hated while she was alive; he was a Big-bellied
Man, with swoln Cheeks, and his Face
of a deep and uncomly Redness; insomuch,
that the Soldiers would seemingly say, <hi>He
was cramm'd with Barly Pudding.</hi> Besides, he
liv'd a slothful, banquetting, idle Life; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was he courteous, or of easie Access, nor
did he oblige any Man by Largessee or Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
The Reason he gave, was, That he
would not offend his Father, by aiming at
popular Applause. Thus he became dear to
his Father only, but dis-respected of every
Body else; yea, those Persons did most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:52279:120"/>
him, who coveted a munificent and an
active Emperor. The same Soldiers that were
wont to call <hi>Bajazet, Softi</hi> (i. e.) a sedden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Man, and given to Ladies; when they
saw that he took up Arms, and ventured his
All to defend himself and his Children, now
extolled him to the Skies, as a Man of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Valour. Why (said they, reasoning
among themselves) should his Father abdicate
a Son, that is his express Image? Why should
he prefer his slothful, pot-bellied Brother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, that had nothing of his Fathers dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
in him? As for <hi>Bajazet's</hi> taking Arms,
Necessity enforced him thereunto, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
he was not to be blamed; for did not
<hi>Selymus,</hi> their Grandfather, do the same?
What greater President could there be? For
he did not only arm against his Brother, but
Necessity also compelled him to hasten his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
death; and yet by this Procedure he esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
the Kingdom to himself and his Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
Now if <hi>Solyman</hi> did rightfully possess
that Kingdom, so unjustly gotten, why should
his Son be denied to take the same Course?
Why should that Fact be vindicated so severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in him, which was accounted Lawful in his
Grandfather? And yet the Cause was much
different (said they); for <hi>Bajazet</hi> did not take
up Arms against his Father, but wishes him a
long Life; nay, he would not hurt and Hair
of his Brothers Head, if he could be sure of
his own Life, against him; but 'tis always
lawful to resist Force by Force, and, if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:52279:121"/>
to prevent ones own certain Ruin.
These Discourses caused many to fly unto <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet,</hi>
and his Army being now of a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
size, without any delay, he marches to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his Brother, putting his Life, Fortune
and the hope of the Empire, upon the Event
of the Battel; for thus thought he with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
my Valour (at least) will be commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if it be not prosperous; I will endeavour
if I can, to break my way into <hi>Syria,</hi> and if I
succeed therein, my Business is done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Selymus</hi> waited for him under the Walls of
<hi>Iconium,</hi> having a vast Army, encreased by
Forces sent him from his Father, and well
furnished with skilful Commanders; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
all other Necessaries, secured with great
Ordnance on every side. <hi>Bajazet</hi> was nothing
terrified at all those Disadvantages, but assoon
as he came in sight of his Brothers Army, he
exhorted his Own, tho' inferiour in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
in this sort.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>says he,</hi> the long wished for Hour is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ome, wherein you may shew your Valour; do you
act as Men, and let me alone to reward you. All
my Fortune is in your Hand; my Misfortunes have
been irksome some time, but now here is an open
Campaign, wherein I may change them for the
better, and forget all the Miseries of my former
Life. If you Conquer, you may expect from me
Honour, Dignity, and all kind of Rewards, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting
Men of Valour. One Victory will compleat
all our Hopes, tho' never so vast, and that you
may get by your superabounding Valour. As for
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:52279:121"/>
my Brothers Troops before your Eyes, they are a
Company of <hi>Buffoons</hi> under a slothful General;
you may easily make way through them with your
swords; what Force he hath with him of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
tho' they are his in Body, yet they are mine at
Heart. 'Tis <hi>Selymus</hi> alone that stands in the
way, both of my Vassals and of your Happiness too,
and therefore, let us both revenge our selves on a
common Enemy. And for their Multitude don't
fear them, Conquest is got by Valour, not by Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
God Almighty uses to assist the <hi>Rest,</hi> not the
<hi>Most;</hi> certainly, if you consider how the savage
Enemy thirsts after your blood, you will preserve
yours by shedding theirs. In fine, <hi>said he,</hi> I will
not only speak, but do; let me be your Pattern;
do you Fight but as valiantly for my safeguard,
as I shall do for your advancement, and I'll war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
you the battle is our own.</p>
               <p>Having finished his Oration, he made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Enemy with an undaunted Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
and in the Front of his Army shew'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
both a brave Soldier and a skilful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
so that he was Renowned also by
his very Enemies. The Battle was bloody,
and many fell on both sides, and Victory
seem'd to hover in the doubtful Wings; but
at last she inclin'd to that side, where was
more Force, a juster Cause, and better Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel;
just in the nick, there arose such a Wind
that it carried the smoak of the Ordinance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the very Faces of <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s Army, so
that they fought blindfold, as it were; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Bajazet,</hi> after much blood-shed on both
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:52279:122"/>
sides, was forced to sound a Retreat; but he
made it with so little of Trepidation, and so
leisurely, that he seemed a Conqueror rather
than a Conquered; neither did <hi>Selymus</hi> make
out of his Camp to pursue him, being well
contented to see his Enemy turn their Backs.</p>
               <p>After this, <hi>Bajazet</hi> considering he had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed
his Father's Commands, by indulging
his own Humour, and being cut off from hi
March into <hi>Syria,</hi> which he had design'd, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to move in good earnest towards <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solyman</hi> had presently a Messenger sent him
of this Victory, and immediately he posted
over into <hi>Asia.</hi> His <hi>Bassa's</hi> would not let
him go before; <hi>But now</hi> (said they) <hi>you must
make haste to press upon</hi> Bajazet <hi>in his Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
and to prevent his Recruit; for if his secret
Favourites should declare for him, they might cut
them out further Work. The Report of your Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
over, will both discourage your Son and terrifie
all his Followers; and, therefore, make haste lest
he serve you as sometimes your Father did, who
was more formidable after he was Conquered than
before, so that his very Overthrow was the Cause,
why at last he prevailed.</hi> Neither did they thus
speak without Cause; for 'tis incredible how
much that Fight, tho' unfortunate, had added
to <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s Renown. That he was so hardily
Valorous, as with a small handful, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison,
to set upon the well disciplin'd Army
of his Brother, strengthened too with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Force; that he was not daunted with the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:52279:122"/>
disadvantage of the Place, nor the roaring of
the great Ordnance, and that he carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the very Battle not as a raw General,
but an expert Commander. 'Tis true, said
they, his Success was not answerable, but
his Valour was not Inferiour; and, therefore,
let <hi>Selymus</hi> boast never so much of his Victory
to his Father, this we are sure of, that of the
Two, <hi>Bajazet</hi> deserved to be Conqueror;
neither did his Brether prevail against him by
true Force, but through Strength. These
Discourses concerning <hi>Bajazet,</hi> shew'd him to
be Popular, and thereupon they double his
Fathers trouble, and his desire to ruin him;
resolved he was none but <hi>Selymus</hi> should suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
him in the Empire; for besides that he
was his eldest Son, he had been always faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and obedient to him; but <hi>Bajazet</hi> had been
contumacious, and gaped after the Throne in
his Life time; and he feared him the more,
because he was esteem'd a very valiant Prince,
and because also he had openly assaulted <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
against him.</p>
               <p>For these Reasons he pass'd the Sea into
<hi>Asia,</hi> but with a Resolution not to stir from
the Shore, but to assist his Son <hi>Selymus</hi>'s Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
only at a distance. For why, thought
he, should I run any hazard to bring my own
Force nearer, lest my Army not fully setled
in their Obedience, should be reapted to a
Revolt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:52279:123"/>
I my self saw <hi>Solyman</hi> march out of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi>
in the Year, 1559, <hi>Iune 5th.</hi> tho'
against the Will of my <hi>Chiaux.</hi> Let me here
present you with a Scheme of Mirth, and like
a Braggadotio-soldier, tell you of two Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
I had at once; for why, I have leisure
enough (unless you count my Cares my study)
and the larger I am in my Scribling, the more
time do I borrow from my Troubles. Hear
then my Contests.</p>
               <p>When I was certainly inform'd that the
<hi>Sultan</hi> was ready to pass over into <hi>Asia,</hi> and
that the day was fix'd for his Departure, I
told my <hi>Chiaux</hi> that I had a mind to see him
march out, and therefore he should come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in the Morning and open the Doors,
for he used to carry the Keys of my Doors
home with him at Night; he promised me
courteously, he would do so. Then I took
order with my <hi>Ianizaries</hi> and my Interpreters,
that they would take me an upper Room in
the Way the Emperor was to pass, conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for my View. They obeyed my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
when the day was come, I rose be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'twas light, and expected that my <hi>Chiaux</hi>
had opened my Doors, but finding them shut,
I sent several Messengers to him, to come and
let me out, both my <hi>Ianizaries</hi> that waited
within Doors and <hi>Druggermen</hi> that waited to
come in; this I did, through the Chinks of
the Gate, which was very old; but the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux</hi>
still spun out Delays, pretending he
would come presently: Thus I spent some
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:52279:123"/>
time, till I heard the noise of the Guns, which
the <hi>Ianizaries</hi> use to shoot off, when their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
takes Horse, then I began to fret and
fume, seeing my self so deluded; my just In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
did affect the <hi>Ianizaries</hi> themselves,
they told me, that if my People would thrust
hard with them, they without would so press
upon the Valves, which were loose and old,
that the Bars would fall out; I took their
Counsel, and the Doors flew open according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and out we went, hying to the Room I
had hired.</p>
               <p>My <hi>Chiaux</hi> had a mind to frustrate my
Desire, and yet he was no bad Man neither;
for having communicated my Request to the
<hi>Bassa's,</hi> that he was not willing that any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
should behold their Prince marching with
so small Force against his own Son, and,
therefore, said they to him, do you promise
him fair, but be sure to delay him tell the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
is a Shipboard; then you may devise some
Excuse or other for your Compurgation:
But he was catch'd in his own Craft.</p>
               <p>When I came to the House where a Room
was hired for me, behold it was shut, so that
I could no more enter into that, than I could
go forth of my own; when I knock'd, no Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
answered; hereupon the <hi>Ianizaries</hi> again
told me, that if I commanded them they
would break open the Doors, or else would
go in at Window and open them. I told
them they should not break open any thing,
but if they would go up to the Windows they
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:52279:124"/>
might; they presently did so, and opened the
Door. When I went up Stairs, I found the
House full of <hi>Iews,</hi> a whole <hi>Synagogue</hi> of
them; they looked upon it, as a Miracle,
that I should enter, when the Doors were
shut; but being informed of the Truth, an old
grave Matron, in comly Habit, profer'd her
self, and complain'd to me in <hi>Spanish</hi> of the
Violence I had offered to the House; I told
her, she had done me wrong, in not keeping
her Word, and that I was not a Man to be
thus deluded; she seem'd unsatisfied, and the
time would not admit further Discourse. In
short, I was allowed one Window, which on
the back side looked out into the Street, and
from thence, with a great deal of Pleasure,
I beheld the whole Proceeding as they pass'd
out of the City.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Gulupagi</hi> and the <hi>Vlupagi</hi> march'd two

a vast number of the Domesticks of the
Prime <hi>Visier,</hi> and of other <hi>Bassa's.</hi> The <hi>Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi>
Horsemen yield a gallant Shew; the best
Breed of Horse is from <hi>Cappadocia</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi>
and the adjacent Countries; he is trapp'd with
Silver Trappings, studded with Gold and
Jewels. His Rider's clad with a Coat or Vest
made of Silk Velvet, or other fine Cloth of
Scarlet, Purple or dark Blue Colour, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed
with Gold and Silver. He hath two
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:52279:124"/>
Cases hanging by his sides, one holds his Bow,
the other his Arrows, both of neat <hi>Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Workmanship, and so is his Buckler held
in his left Arm, strong enough to resist Blows
made by Arrows or Clubs: In his right Hand,
unless he desire to have it free, he carries a
light Spear, for the most part painted with
Green; his Scimitar is studded with Jewels,
and made of Steel, and it hangs down from
his Saddle. What need so much Armour, say
you? I'll tell you. They use them all; and
that dexterously too, you'll reply. How can
he use that Spear and the Bow too? What!
will he take up his Spear when he hath broke,
or thrown away his Bow? Not so neither,
For he keeps his Spear as long as he can; but
when he hath occasion to use his Bow, the
Spear being light and easily manag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it between his Saddle and his Thigh; so that
the Point thereof sticks out backward; and
thus he presses it down with his Knee, as long
as he pleases. But if he fight only with the
Spear, then he puts up his Bow into his Case,
or else with his left Hand places it behind his
Shield. But it is not my present Design to
acquaint you with the <hi>Turks</hi> expertness at
Arms; they have obtain'd it by long Use and
Experience in War. Their Heads are cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with very fine White Cotten-Linnen, in
the midst whereof stands up a Tust made of
Purple Silk, divided chamferingly; some of
them wear black Feathers a-top.</p>

                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:52279:125"/>
After the Horse, a large Body of <hi>Ianiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
followd, being Foot, and seldom taking
any other Arms than Muskets. The Form
and Colour of their Cloths is almost one and
the same, so that you would judge them all to
be the Servants of one Man's Family. They
have no prodigious Habit among them, nor
any thing rent or torn; their Cloaths will
wear not soon enough, they say, without their
tearing of them; yet in their Feathers, Crests,
and such-like military Ornaments, they are
over-curious, or rather proud, especially, the
<hi>Veterans</hi> in the Rear, you would think a whole
Wood of walking Feathers were in their
Fire-stars and Frontals; after them their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and Commanders follow on Horseback,
distinguished each by his proper Ensign. In
the last Place marches their <hi>Aga,</hi> or General.
Then succeed the chief Courtiers, amongst
whom are the <hi>Bassa's;</hi> then the Foot of their
Prince's Life-Guard in a peculiar Habit,
carrying their Bows bent in their Hands, for
they are all Archers; next the Princes Led-Horses,
all with curious Trappings. He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
rode on a stately Prauncer, looking sour
with his Brows bent, as if he had been angry;
behind him came three Youths, one carrying
a Flagon of Water, another his Cloak, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Bow. Then followed some Eunuchs
of the Bed-Chamber; and, at last, a Troop
of about Two Hundred Horse closed the
Proceeding.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:52279:125"/>
After I had the satisfaction of viewing all
this, my only care was now to appease my
Hostess, she that at my entrance spake to me
in <hi>Spanish,</hi> for I heard she was very familiar
with <hi>Rustan</hi>'s Wife, and therefore I was afraid
she would represent things unhandsomly against
me; to prevent which, I sent for her, and told
her she should have remembred her Bargain, and
not have shut her Door against me who had
hired a Room; but though, said I, you don't
remember your Promise, I'le perform mine;
yea I will be better than my word: I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
you but 7 Pistriots, but here's 10 for
you, that so you may not repent your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance
of me into your House. When the
Woman thus unexpectedly saw her Hand fill'd
with Gold, she was presently melted down
into a Compliance, and the whole Synagogue
of them fell to blandishments and giving me
thanks, and the Woman that was Chrony to
<hi>Rustan</hi>'s Wife, made one in the Consort, for
she always in my Landladies name gave me
great Thanks: They brought forth <hi>Grecian</hi>
Wine and a Banquet, but I refused to eat,
but with the great Acclamations of all the <hi>Iews,</hi>
made hast to be gone, that I might manage a
new Combat with my <hi>Chiaux,</hi> for keeping
my Doors fasten'd, when I should have come
forth.</p>
               <p>I found him sitting mournfully in my Porch,
where he began a long Complaint, that I
ought not to have gone abroad without his
Consent, nor to have broke open the Door:
that I had violated the Law of Nations thereby,
and such like stuff. I replyed in short, That
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:52279:126"/>
if he had come betimes in the Morning as he
promised, he had prevented all this; his
breach of Promise had occasioned it, for his
intent was only to delude. I demanded also
of him, whether he lookt upon me as an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador,
or a Prisoner? For an Ambassador,
says he; if for a Prisoner, said I, then I am
not an Instrument to make a Peace, for a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
is not his own man; but if an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador,
as you confess, then why am I not
a Free-man? Why can't I go abroad when I
will? <hi>Captives</hi> use to be shut up, not <hi>Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors;</hi>
Liberty is granted such in all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they may claim it as their publick due:
He ought to know, that he was not appointed
to be my Serjeant or Keeper, but to assist me,
(as he himself used to say) with his good
Offices, that so no other man might do any
injury to me or mine.</p>
               <p>Hereupon he turns to the <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> and
quarrels with them, for giving me advice to
break open the Doors, and for being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
with my Servants therein. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
I had need of their advice: I commanded
them to open them, and they obey'd; there
was no great ado about it, the Doors were
old, and flew open presently; there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
either lost or broken. Thus the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux</hi>
was forced with me to hold his peace,
and I never heard any more of the matter.</p>
               <p>A while after I had also leave to pass over
the Sea, for the <hi>Turks</hi> judged it conducing
to their Affairs, to Treat me kindly in their
Camp, as the Ambassador of a Prince in Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance
with them; and to that end, I had a
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:52279:126"/>
handsom Lodging provided for me near their
Camp, where I had all the Conveniences ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable:
I lived there three Months, and had
the opportunity to view the Camp of the
<hi>Turks,</hi> which was extended all over the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Fields, and to discover some parts
of their Discipline: You will not find fault
with me, if I acquaint you with something
thereof. Know then, that I cloathed my self
as <hi>Christians</hi> do in that Country, and with
one or two Attendants walked up and down
their Camp <hi>incognito.</hi> The first thing I saw
was the Soldiers of each Body quartered with
great Order in their several Ranks, and that
with a great deal of silence, ('tis far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in <hi>Christian</hi> Camps) all hush, not a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
breath, or noise amongst them in their
Jollities. Besides, they are wonderfully clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
no beastliness, no noisom smell to offend
Eye or Ear; all their Ordure they bury un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ground, or throw it far enough off.
When they have occasion to ease Nature, they
dig a Pit with a Spade, and there bury their
Excrements; so that there is no ill smell at
all. Besides, there are no Drinking-matches
amongst them, no playing with Cards or
Dice, (the Bane of the <hi>Christian Army:</hi>) I
only heard one common Soldier playing a
doleful Ditty on an Harp ill tuned, and his
Fellows were howling rather than singing;
it was a Soldier's farewel Word in the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and he canted out the last
words of his Fellow-Soldier, who died of
his Wounds on the Grass bank of the <hi>Danow;</hi>
he abjured that River, because the Streams
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:52279:127"/>
thereof were to glide to his own Country,
that it should commend him to his Friends
there, and tell them that he died no ignoble
nor unrevenged Death for the glory of their
Nation, and encrease of their Religion. His
Fellows groaned out, <hi>Thrice happy he, O that
our Case was like his.</hi> For you must know, the
<hi>Turks</hi> are of this opinion, That no Souls go
more directly to Heaven than those of valiant
Men, who lost their lives in the Field; and
that Virgins do pour out daily Prayers to
God for their safety.</p>
               <p>I had a mind to pass through their Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
that I might see what Flesh was sold
there; I saw only four or Five Weathers at
most hung up dress'd; it was the Shambles
of the <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> who were at least 4000: I
wondred so little Flesh could suffice so many;
and was answered, They used but little flesh,
but a great part of their Diet was brought
from <hi>Constantinople:</hi> When I demanded, <hi>what
that was,</hi> they shewed me a <hi>Ianizary</hi> neer at
hand, who was lying down, and was boiling
Turnips, Leeks, Garlick, Parsnips, and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbers,
seasoning them with Salt and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar;
and Hunger being his best Sauce, eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them as heartily, as if they had been Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge
or Phesant.</p>
               <p>Their Drink was that which was common
to all Animals, <hi>viz. Water;</hi> by this frugality
they consult the Health of their Bodies, and
also the saving of their Money. And the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
time wherein they did this, caused me to
admire the more; it was their Fast, (or as
we call it, <hi>Lent)</hi> at which time among <hi>Christians</hi>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:52279:127"/>
even in well govern'd Cities, as well as in
Camps, there is nothing but Sporting, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
Singing, Revelling, Drunkenness, and
such like Madness; insomuch that a <hi>Turkish
Envoy</hi> coming once at that time of the year,
reported at his return, That the <hi>Christians</hi>
at certain times grew mad and raging, but
sprinkling themselves with a sort of Ashes in
their Temples, they recovered their Wits
again, so that they did not seem the same
Men; thereby denoting <hi>Ash-Wednesday,</hi> and
its Eve. The <hi>Turks</hi> fearing this, were struck
with a great Amazement, because they have
many Medicines amongst them which cause
Madness, but very few that procure a speedy
recovery therefrom.</p>
               <p>For the Days immediately preceding their
Fasts, they do not alter their private way of
living in their Worshiping; rather on the
contrary, they abridge themselves of some of
their daily Commons, that they may provide for
their Fasts, lest a sudden abstinence might be
prejudicial to their Healths.</p>
               <p>The time of their Fast is so appointed, that
every Year it comes fifteen Days sooner than
the former; the reason is, because they fill
not the 12 yearly spaces of the <hi>Moon:</hi> Hence
it comes to pass, that their Fast kept in the
early Spring after six Years, happens at the
beginning of Summer; for they measure their
Fasts by the course of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and there
are none more irksom to them, than those
which fall out in the long Summer-days; for
while they fast, not a bit, nor so much as a drop
of water goes down (neither dare they so much
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:52279:128"/>
as wash their Mouths therewith) before the
Star appear in the Evening, the longest Day
of Abstinence, being hot, and daily too, must
needs be very tedious, especially to the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
sort, who live by their dusty labour: yet
before Sun-rise (though not after) while yet
the Stars shine in the Firmament, it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for them to eat; and therefore they bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
endure their Winter Fasts. And that
they may not be deceived by the darkness of
the Weather, their Priests hang out Lights
in Paper-Lanthorns from the top of their
<hi>Moschs,</hi> (from whence they are wont, by
sound of Voice to call them to Prayers, as
we do by Bells:) And this shews that their
Eating-time is come, whereupon entring
presently into their Temples, and worshiping
God in their way, they return to Supper.</p>
               <p>In the close of their Summer-Fasts, I once
saw a great many of them to go into a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
over against my Lodging (where Ice was
always to be sold coming from Mount <hi>Olympus</hi>
in <hi>Asia</hi>) and there they askt for Icy-water,
which they drank jetting strangely backward;
for the <hi>Turks</hi> count it profane either to Eat,
Drink, or Piss, in a standing posture, unless
in case of necessity; but they do it bending
their Bodies; as Women do with us when
they make Water. And whereas in the dusk
of the Evening I could not well discern the
meaning of that Posture, I was told that most
of them drank a draught of cold Water, to
make way for their Meat, for otherwise it
would stick to their Jaws and they could not
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:52279:128"/>
swallow it; and besides, this moisture of their
Palate did quicken their Appetites.</p>
               <p>In their Diet they are not choice, and after
their Fasts they may eat any Meat, which was
lawful for them to do at other times. If they
fall sick, they omit their Fasts, but with this
condition, that when they recover they must
fast so many Days over, as they neglected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
But when they are near an Enemy, and
ready to fight, lest fasting should weaken
their Bodies, they are allowed to eat; and if a
blind Superstition detains some of them, then
their Emperour, at Noon, in the sight of his
whole Army cuts his Dinner, and by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
they are encouraged to do the same.</p>
               <p>They use Wine at no time of the Year, they
count it profane and irreligious so to do, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
they abhor it on their Fasts, then no
man is so much as to smell to it, much less
to tast it.</p>
               <p>I often askt why <hi>Mahomet</hi> was so strict, as
to forbid his Followers the use of Wine; In
answer to my demand, they told me this
Story, That <hi>Mahomet</hi> making a Journey to
his Friend, at Noon entred into a House
where there was a Marriage-Feast, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
down with the Guests, he observed them
to be very merry and jovial, kissing and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
one another, which was attributed
to the chearfulness of their Spirits raised by
the Wine; so that he blessed it as a sacred
Thing, as being an Instrument of much Love
amongst Men: But returning to the same
House the next Day, he beheld another face
of Things; as gore blood on the ground, an
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:52279:129"/>
Hand cut off, an Arm, Foot, and other Limbs
dismember'd, which he was told was the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of the Brawls and Fightings occasioned
by the Wine, which made them mad, and
destroy one another: Whereupon he changed
his Mind, turning his former <hi>Blessing</hi> into a
<hi>Curse,</hi> and forbidding it, as an Abomination,
to all his Disciples.</p>
               <p>For this reason all was quiet in the Camp,
and the greatest composure imaginable, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
at their Feast-time; so much did Camp-Discipline
and a strictness received from their
Ancestors prevail upon them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> punish all flagitious Disorders
very severely; their Punishments are, loss of
their Places, sale of their Goods, basting with
Clubs, Death; but Club-basting is most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
from which the <hi>Ianizaries</hi> themselves are
not free, tho' they may not as such be put to
death; their lighter Offences are chastised
by the Club, their more hainous by casher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or degrading, which they count worse
than death, because commonly they are put
to death afterwards; for being stript of the
Ensigns of <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> they are banisht to the
farthest Garison of the Empire, where they
live contemptible and inglorious, till up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any light occasion they are put to death,
yet not as <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> but as common Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
only.</p>
               <p>And here let me acquaint you with the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
of the <hi>Turk</hi> in receiving that <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
they'l receive sometimes an hundred
blows on their Legs, their Feet and Buttocks,
with wonderful patience; so that divers Clubs
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:52279:129"/>
are broke, and the Executioner cries out,
<hi>Give me another:</hi> yea, sometimes the Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is so severe, that several parcels of torn
flesh are cut off from the wounded parts, in
order to their ease; yet for all this, they
must go to their Officer, who commanded
them to be punisht, they must kiss his Hand,
and give him Thanks; nay, they must also
give the Executioner a Reward for beating
them: the Club they are beaten with, they
count <hi>sacred,</hi> and that it fell down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
as the <hi>Romans</hi> counted their <hi>Praise</hi> to
do, and as some Relief to their Misery; they
count those parts wounded with the Rod or
Club, to be free from any Purgations, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piations
after this life.</p>
               <p>When I told you, that the <hi>Turk's</hi> Camp
were free from Broyls and Tumults, I must
except One, which was made by my own
Men: The Occasion was this, Some of my
Servants had a mind to walk out of the Camp,
without any <hi>Ianizaries</hi> to attend them; only
taking some <hi>Italian</hi> Renegado's that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
the <hi>Turks Religion.</hi> Let me tell you by
the way, that these <hi>Italians</hi> are of good use
in that Country, especially in redeeming of
Captives, for they come to their Masters,
and pretend they are either their Kinsmen, or
their Countrymen, and therefore out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
to them, they desire to buy them as
their Pastrons, for a Price agreed, and
so they set them free: But if a <hi>Christian</hi>
should make the same profer to them, they
would either refuse him, or hold him to a far
greater Rate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:52279:130"/>But to return; Some of my People as I
told you, gadding abroad, they light upon
some <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> who came from Swimming
and Washing themselves in the Sea, without
the Badges of their Order on their Heads,
only some Linnen being very slighlty wrapped
about them. These <hi>Ianizaries</hi> revil'd my
People, knowing them to be <hi>Christians;</hi> for
that's the guise of the <hi>Turks,</hi> to reproach <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;</hi>
'tis a Principle of their Religion, they
think thereby to incline them to exchange
it for a better, as they count theirs to
be: My Folks being thus provoked, return
Jeer for Jeer; from Words they came to
Blows, the <hi>Italians</hi> assisting my Men, the
cause of the Scuffle was, that one of the <hi>Iani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries</hi>
lost the Linen Covering off his Head,
which was thrown I know not whither:
Hereupon the <hi>Ianizaries</hi> hye to their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
complaining of their Wrongs and loss
received by my Servants, for they watch'd
them, and found them return'd to my House:
Their General presently sent for my Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter,
who was present at the Conflict; He
was seiz'd upon sitting at my Door, and they
were pulling of him away. I beheld it from
a Gallery above, and was much concern'd,
that any of my Family should be taken forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
from me without my Consent, to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to the <hi>Bastinado,</hi> (for I understood
something of the Matter before) for I could
not imagine he would be return'd to me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being well beaten, he being one of the
<hi>Turk's</hi> Subjects. Whereupon I ran down,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:52279:130"/>
and laid hold on him, commanding him to
let him go; they did so grumblingly, but
hasted presently with far more grievous
Complaints to their General; who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more of their Company to go and seize
those <hi>Italians</hi> who of <hi>Christians</hi> are said to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>Turks;</hi> yet he charged them to offer
no Violence to me at the House where I
lodged. They came back presently, and
with a great Noise and many Threats, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
those <hi>Italians;</hi> but they foreseeing
what would come to pass, had sailed back to
<hi>Constantinople:</hi> Much Clamour there was on
both sides, at last my <hi>Chiaux</hi> which at that
time was an old decrepid Man, out of jeer
thrust some Pistols into their Hands un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to me, to buy a new Bonnet in the
room of that which was lost, and thus the
Dispute ended.</p>
               <p>I have been the more punctual in relating
this Story, because on this occasion, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
from <hi>Rustan</hi>'s own Mouth, what Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
the <hi>Sultan</hi> had of the <hi>Ianizaries:</hi> For he
hearing of this Scuffle, sent a Messenger to
me, to desire me to cut off all occasion of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
with the <hi>Ianizaries</hi> as the worst of Men:
You know, said he, 'tis a time of War,
wherein they may be said to reign, rather than
the <hi>Sultan,</hi> who stands in fear of them himself
This he spake as being well acquainted with
the Sentiments of <hi>Solyman,</hi> who always sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cted
some Men of their own to lye in wait
against their <hi>Militia,</hi> which would break forth
when he had no Opportunities to prevent it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:52279:131"/>
And the truth is, though there may be
some use of a standing Guard and <hi>Mil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tia,</hi>
yet there are also many Inconveniences at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
it, of which this is the chief, their
Emperor is very fearful of them, lest having the
Sword in their Hands, they should alter the
Government as they pleas'd, of which there
had been many Presidents, yet there are ways
also, wereby this may be prevented.</p>
               <p>While I was in their Camp, there came
<hi>Albertus de Vbiis,</hi> a worthy and learned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as I think born at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> as an
Envoy from my Master <hi>Caesar;</hi> He brought
with him some Presents for their <hi>Sultan,</hi> as
some Goblets gilt with Gold, with a Clock
neatly made, and carried like a Tower on
an Elephants Back; as also some Mony to
be distributed amongst the <hi>Bassa's: Solyman</hi>
would have me deliver these Presents in the
Camp, that the Amity betwixt Him and my
Master might be more publickly known, and
so no Danger at all to be feared from the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
Arms.</p>
               <p>But to return to <hi>Bajazet,</hi> after the Fight
at <hi>Iconium,</hi> who retired to his Government of
<hi>Amasia,</hi> pretending to live quietly there, if
his Father would permit him so to do. For
why? He had sown his wild Oats, and for
the future seem'd plyable to obey his Fathers
Will; and for this he employed sundry Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to carry submissive Letters to his Father,
begging his Pardon: Neither did <hi>Solyman</hi>
pretend that he was averse from Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with his Son, and therefore he admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his Messengers into his Presence; he read
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:52279:131"/>
his Letters, and answered them mildly. So that
the Report was spread over all the Army
what an Agreement was like to be between
Father and Son; what he had done amiss, was
to be imputed to the hot Blood of his Youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Age, provided he would shew himself
Obsequious the residue of his Life. This <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman</hi>
did by the Advice of his <hi>Bassa's,</hi>
for the cunning old Man would not declare
himself, till he had brought <hi>Bajazet</hi> into the
Nooz of his own Power. He was terribly
afraid, lest out of Desperation he should march
furiously into <hi>Persia</hi> (his only Place of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge)
with so great Post-haste, that all his
<hi>Sanziacks</hi> should not be able to prevent them.
To prevent which Mistakes, he sent many
Letters to all the Governours upon the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
to watch <hi>Bajazet,</hi> and not to suffer him
to escape, if he attempted it.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, he put all those of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet</hi>'s
Party that he could light upon, to the
Rack; and when he had got out of them what
he could, he put them privately to death;
amongst which were some that <hi>Bajazet</hi> had
sent to be his Companions to his Father.</p>
               <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Persia</hi> at that time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
all the Countries between the <hi>Caspian</hi>
Sea, and the Seas of <hi>Persia,</hi> with some part
of <hi>Armenia</hi> the Greater, (though <hi>Solyman</hi>
by taking of <hi>Babylon, Mesopotamia,</hi> and part
of <hi>Media</hi> had abridged their Empire very
much) and other far Countries even to the
Empire of the <hi>Homaium Patisach,</hi> as the <hi>Turks</hi>
call him, and over that last part of Land
<hi>Sagathmas</hi> was King: The Father had been
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:52279:132"/>
formerly over-thrown by <hi>Selymus</hi> in a great
Fight in the Field of <hi>Chalderon;</hi> and from that
time the <hi>Persian</hi> Affairs began to decline, for
<hi>Solyman</hi> a fierce Enginier press'd upon the
very Face; and <hi>Thamas</hi> being much inferiour
to his Father's Courage, made but a weak De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence:
For he was wholly given to Sloth and
Idleness, and would sit in his Palace amongst
a Croud of Harlots, amorously pleasing his
Humour; and sometimes consulting Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
concerning future Events: He had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Care of Administring publick Justice to
his People. This Neglect of his opened the
Door to all Injustice and Oppression in every
part of his Empire: For the Strong oppressed
the Weaker, and Innocence could find no
Justice or Defence in his Court.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding this malevolous Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
yet the <hi>Persians</hi> have so sacred an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of their Prince, that they believe him
happy, that can but kiss the Door of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace;
and the Water wherein he washes
his Hands, they use in order to the Cure of
several Diseases. He hath many Children,
but the most promising is <hi>Ismael,</hi> like his
Grandfather both in Name and Nature; a
beautiful Prince, and a Capital Enemy to the
Race of the <hi>Ottomans.</hi> 'Tis reported that he
was brought forth into the World with his
Fist all bloody, whence 'twas vulgarly said,
That he would be a Warlike Person; and
when he was but young he confirmed that
Report, by obtaining a great Victory over the
<hi>Turks.</hi> But when his Father made Peace with
<hi>Solyman,</hi> 'twas agreed betwixt them, that
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:52279:132"/>
                  <hi>Ismael</hi> should be sent Prisoner into the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
of his Kingdom, that he might be no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle
to the intended Agreement: And yet
as ill us'd as he is after his Fathers death, 'tis
thought he would succeed in the Empire.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Solyman</hi> fearing that <hi>Sagathamas,</hi> (or as
we call him, the <hi>Sophi</hi>) would be more mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of old Grudges, than of the late Peace
to which he was in a manner compell'd, and
that if his Son went thither, he should have
much ado to get him thence, and perhaps it
might occasion a long War between the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires,
did use his utmost endeavour to stop
or take him, before he could come thither.
The old Man had not forgot that a few Years
before <hi>Helcas, Thamas</hi>'s Brother had fled to
him, and had been supported by him, and it
cost his Brother dear to recover him, and
therefore he feared that <hi>Thamas</hi> would serve
him the same sauce, and perhaps recover by
the Sword all the Countries he had taken
from him. The Design of <hi>Solyman</hi> was kept
very secret, yet <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s Friends smelt it out,
and therefore advised him by no means to
trust his Father, but to consult his Safety, by
avoiding his Misery, what way soever he
could. And <hi>Bajazet</hi> was perswaded so to do
upon a small occasion, (as oft great Matters
turn into little Injuries.) There was a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
of <hi>Bajazet</hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s taken in <hi>Solyman</hi>'s Camp,
and hang'd up as a Spy, because that <hi>Bajazet</hi>
had listed him, after his Father had given him
strict charge to list no more Souldiers. This
was warning enough to <hi>Bajazet</hi> to pack up
and be gone. Now <hi>Solyman</hi> thought himself
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:52279:133"/>
sure of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> and to deceive him the more,
he caused his Army to begin their March the
Day after <hi>Easter,</hi> back to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> But
<hi>Bajazet,</hi> after Prayer, upon <hi>Easter-Day,</hi>
summon'd all his Relicks, and began his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Voyage towards <hi>Persia;</hi> he knew
well enough that he went to the old Enemy
of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> House, but he was resolv'd to
try the mercy of any body, rather than fall
into his Fathers Hands. There marched out
with him all that were able to bear Arms,
none were left behind but weak Persons,
Women and Children, that were not able to
bear the Toil of so long a Journey; amongst
which was a young Child of his own, with
his Mother, whose Innocency he thought
would protect them from his Fathers Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and therefore he thought it best to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them to his Clemency, rather than make
them Companions of his woful and miserable
Fight; and the truth is, <hi>Solyman</hi> as yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
what would become of the Father, spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Life of his Infant Son at present, and
sent him to be Educated at <hi>Prusia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would have return'd to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the
Day before <hi>Easter,</hi> but had a great mind to
see, how the <hi>Turks</hi> did observe that Festival;
and I was not sure that ever I should have so
fair an Opportunity again. They were to
Celebrate it in the open Field, before the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's
own Tent. I therefore caused my
Servants to take a Room in the Tent of a
<hi>Turkish</hi> Souldier, that stood on a rising ground,
and look'd down on <hi>Solyman</hi>'s Tent, which
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:52279:133"/>
was over against it: Thither go I at Sun-rise,
where in an open Plain, I beheld a vast Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Turbanted Heads silently stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but repeating the last words of their
Priest. Every Rank was ranged orderly,
and standing, that in the open Field
they seemed to be a Wall one to another:
The most Honourable had their Station next
the Emperor's Train, uppermost in the Camp,
and their Turbants as white as Snow: Such
diversity of Colours did affect me with a great
deal of Pleasure, and the rather, because they
stood unmovable, as if they had grown upon
the Place; not a Cough, Schriek nor Word
to be heard; no, nor the least moving of the
Head to look backward, or about them: At
the Name of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> they all as one Man,
bowed their Heads, even to the Knee; but
when the Name of God was pronounced, they
all fell Prostrate on their Faces, and Kissed the
Ground.</p>
               <p>And the truth is, the <hi>Turks</hi> are very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and ceremonious in the acts of their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
for if a Man doth but scratch his Head
when he Prays, they think his Prayer is lost.
For thus say they, If a Man composes his Body
so reverently even when he speaks but to a <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa,</hi>
how much more fitting is it we should do
it to God, who is infinitely greater than the
greatest of Men?</p>
               <p>After Prayer, the whole Knot of them was
broke asunder, and they ran up and down
ranging over the Fields: Anon the Emperor's
Dinner is served up, which the <hi>Ianisaries</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
away Dish by Dish, and eat it with a
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:52279:134"/>
gret deal of Jollity and Mirth: T'is an allowed
Custom for them so to do, on that day, their Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
being provided of a Dinner elsewhere. When
I had beheld their Shew, I returned with a great
deal of pleasure to <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The remainder of my Task, is to acquaint you
what became of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> and then I shall ease you
of the trouble of Reading, and my self of Writing.
He, as I told you, with his Invincible Band, March'd
out of <hi>Amasia</hi> with such speed, that his coming pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
the Report thereof; and those <hi>Bassa</hi>'s who
designed to observe his Motion, he came upon them
unawars. He put a notable Cheat upon the <hi>Bassa</hi>
of <hi>Constantinople;</hi> for whereas, there were ways in
his Province by which he might March, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
had beset the chiefest of them; he sent some
before him pretended to be Runaways, to inform
him, that he was gone the furthest way about; which
he giving Credit to, removed his Troops thither to
prevent him, and so left him a free passage.</p>
               <p>He put the like Trick upon the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Erze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumen,</hi>
for knowing that the Passage through the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
would be very hazardous, he sent some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him with a counterfeit Message, to Salute him,
and tell him, that his Misfortunes had reduced him
to the top of all miseries, and therefore he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
him that he might rest a day or two in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
at least to procure his Horses to be relieved
and new Shod.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bassa</hi> granted his request, whereas, it was
not a commiserating his Case, or that he favoured
his Side, but perhaps that he might amaze him a
little till he had got all his Troops together to ensnare
him; for they were scattered, as not dreaming he
would be so soon upon him. However <hi>Bajazet</hi>
March'd continually on, allowing his men no rest
by day, and very little at Night. The <hi>Bassa</hi> of
<hi>Erzerumen</hi> seeing himself Deceived, made haste to
joyn himself with the other <hi>Bassa</hi>'s in his Flight.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:52279:134"/>
For you must know, as soon as <hi>Solyman</hi> heard
his Son was gone from <hi>Amazia,</hi> he commanded
a great many <hi>Sanziacks</hi> and <hi>Bassa</hi>'s to follow, and
upon pain of Death to bring him either Alive or
Dead; but all in vain, for <hi>Bajazet</hi> Fled faster
than they could Persue: The <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Casgan,</hi>
afore-mentioned, paid dear enough for letting
him escape, for <hi>Solyman</hi> put him out of his
Place, but <hi>Selymus</hi> put him to Death, together with
his two Boys, tho' not before they had been most
inhumanly Butchered. <hi>Selymus</hi> and <hi>Mehemet Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa,</hi>
and <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> persued <hi>Bajazet</hi> a
far longer distance. <hi>Solyman</hi> was much troubled
when he heard of his Escape, as being wel assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
he would make towards <hi>Persia;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he was about to gather all his Force both
Horse and Foot together, and so March away to
declare War against <hi>Persia:</hi> But his greater Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors
stopped his March, alledging the hazard
he would run amongst an ingrateful Soldiery:
And besides, say they, what if <hi>Bajazet</hi> out of his
temerity and rashness should send a Company a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Pontus</hi> and the <hi>Palus Moeotis,</hi> and so march
back to <hi>Constantinople</hi> in the Emperor's Absence,
where he might by promising Liberty to Captives,
and to the <hi>Agiomaglans,</hi> get upon the Throne, now
empty of a Prince? These Advices restrained <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
from his Intention.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bajazet</hi> all along his March, caused Labels to be
fixed to the Doors of the Houses, that he would give
double Pay to all the Soldiers that would Revolt to
him; which made <hi>Solyman</hi>'s Soldiers suspected by
their Officers, and the rather, because the Common
Soldiers suffered many Speeches in favour of <hi>Baja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet.</hi>
After much ado, <hi>Bajazet</hi> escaped to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Araxes,</hi> which is the Bounds betwixt the two
Empires of <hi>Turkey</hi> and <hi>Persia;</hi> and after he had
pass'd this River, he scarce thought himself secure,
but appointed some of his own Soldiers to Guard
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:52279:135"/>
the Banks, that so the pursuing <hi>Sanziacks</hi> might not
pass over: But they being but few, were easily
discomfited e'er the <hi>Turkish</hi> Commanders pass'd far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into <hi>Persia,</hi> till at last they met with a great
Body of <hi>Persian</hi> Horse, whose Commanders de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of them, why they Invaded another Prince's
Territories? Their Answer was, they were to fetch
the Fugitive Son of their own Prince. The <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
told 'em, 'twas contrary to the League to come
Armed into their Dominions; there was Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Sagathma</hi> and <hi>Solyman,</hi> which they ought
not to Violate: As for <hi>Bajazet,</hi> their Prince would
do what was fitting; in the mean time they should
retreat to their own Country: With this Reprimand
they direct their March backward. In the mean time
immediately Messengers are sent from <hi>Persia,</hi> to
<hi>Bajazet</hi> to bid him return, and to know the cause
of his coming, and also to spy what Force he had
brought with him. <hi>Bajazet</hi> Answers, that his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Insolency and Father's Displeasure, had dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him out of his own Country, and he was come
to <hi>Persia,</hi> as the only Altar for an oppressed Prince;
and therefore in confideration of the uncertainty of
future Affairs, he hoped he would afford him Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
being destitute of all things. The <hi>Persian</hi>
Answered, He was not well advised to repair to
him who had made Peace with his Father; upon
this condition, they were both to Serve the same
Friend and Enemy, which League he could not Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate;
nevertheless, since he was come, he bid him
Wellcome, he would do his utmost to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
him to his Father. Thus his first Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>Persia</hi> was Promising enough; nought but
Gratulations, Feastings, friendly Entertainments,
and Merry-makings, by which subtil Men disguise
their Meanings; yea, mention was made of an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity
also, that <hi>Orchanes, Bajazet</hi>'s Son should
Marry one of the <hi>Sophi</hi>'s Daughters; yea, they
gave him hopes, that the <hi>Sophi</hi> would never be at
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:52279:135"/>
quiet, till <hi>Solyman</hi> had bestowed upon him the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> or <hi>Babylon,</hi> or <hi>Arzerum,</hi>
for there, say they, you may live Commodiously
withour fear, as being at a great distance both from
your Brother and your Father too; and if either of
them should deal hardly with you, you will have a
Father-in-Law to fly too, which will afford you
Sanctuary: Such Discourses were received among the
Vulgar, whereby <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s thoughts might be diverted
from the apprehension of present danger. The <hi>Sophi</hi> sent
many Embassadors to <hi>Solyman</hi> on this Errand, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he dealt sincerely with <hi>Bajazet</hi> to reconcile him
to his Father, yea, or no, might be a great question,
seeing in the mean time, he contrived all ways to
Destroy him; for <hi>Sagathmas</hi> was in a mighty fear,
lest he should nourish a Serpent in his Bosom, and
which encreased his rancour, was the wicked design
of some who perswaded <hi>Bajazet</hi> to attempt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
of <hi>Sagathmas;</hi> for one of <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
was heard to say, <hi>Why do we not Kill this
Heretick, and Possess his Kingdoms? For without
doubt, he will one day be the ruin of us all.</hi> These
wild Discourses coming to <hi>Sagathmas</hi>'s Ears, put
him upon a Project more necessary than plausible;
for <hi>Bajazet</hi> had not many Forces, but very war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
ones; and there were many Valiant Men among
them that were ready to attempt any Invasion, and
therfore he had reason to fear. He was conscious
also that he had added new Kingdoms to his own, as
being Conquer'd on pretence of Religion; and who
would secure such sickly Subjects, who were wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of their present State and coveted a Change?
To these nothing could be more Oppressive, than
the coming of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> tho' he is more in my Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
than I am in his, and therefore I were best im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the Opportunity, and treat him no longer as
a Guest, but as an Enemy to be Chained up. To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
which, no method was more advisable than to
sever him from his Forces, for then he may be more
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:52279:136"/>
easily Trapp'd; by open Force 'tis hard to Seize
him, his Soldiers being well Train'd and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd,
but mine slothful, unaccustomed to Arms,
and besides at a great Distance one from another.
Hereupon <hi>Bajazet</hi> was desired to separate his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
it being allowed it was Commodious so to do.
He could not withstand the Proposal, tho' intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Men foresaw the danger thereof: But, alas, he
that was under another Man's Roof, must now be
at their Beck who Maintained him, especially since
it would breed a suspicion if he entertained so much
as the report of Perfidiousness in his Host that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
him. Hereupon his Men were divided,
never to see one another again, and Quartered where
the <hi>Persians</hi> pleased; and being put here, very
shortly after Slain by the more numerous <hi>Persians,</hi>
their Arms, Horses, and all else they had, fell a
Prey to the Conqueror. At the same time <hi>Bajazet</hi>
was clapp'd up in Prison, with his Children; and
to encrease the indignity of the thing, he was haled
even from a Feast, to a Dungeon.</p>
               <p>Thus have I here satisfied your desire, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting
you with the stay of <hi>Bajazet:</hi> 'Tis time
now to consider what will become of him for
the future: Some think he will will Retreat to
<hi>Babylon,</hi> or such-like Province, on the Borders of
each Empire, to be <hi>Sanziack</hi> thereof. Others think
it a desperate Case, and that there is no hope of
his Life either from <hi>Solyman</hi> or <hi>Sagathmas;</hi> but that
he will either be sent back hither to be put to Death,
or Strangled in Prison there.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Persian</hi> weighed every thing in his
Thoughts, when he put <hi>Bajazet</hi> in Prison; he knew
he was of an aspiring and couragious Spirit, far su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
to his Brother; and if he should Succeed his
Father in the Empire, it might do <hi>Persia</hi> much
more mischief than ever <hi>Solymus</hi> could, for
he was but a slothful Prince, and not at all for War,
and therefore some thought he would never escape
out of his hands; for to besure he can never be his
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:52279:136"/>
Friend, because he hath injured him so much. Some
think one thing, and some think another: For my
part, I think it will be an intricate Business.
For, as <hi>Bajazet</hi> is in Troubles, and the issue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determin'd,
they will not easily make War on <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom</hi>
in this Juncture. They labour to obtrude on
me certain Conditions of Peace, having some Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that will please my Master, but they allow me
no Copy of them, as heretofore they were wont to
do, so that I suspect Fraud in the case, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
do peremptorily refuse to send those Letters to
<hi>Cesar,</hi> unless first I know their Contents; and if
they deceive me by a false Copy, then the blame
lyes at their door, not at mine; so that by this
means I shall free my Master from answering their
Captious Letters; for I am sure he will accept of
no Conditions of Peace but such as are Honourable
ones. But you'll say, if you refuse to accept of
their Conditions of Peace, 'tis one step towards a
War. Let it be as it will, I judge it more advisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to leave all free to the events of future Ages.
But the not sending their Letters, if that be a Crime,
I shall take it on my self, and I shall easily clear
my self, if the issue of <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s Affairs do not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
their Expectation; seeing it is yet very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult,
tho' not impossible, for the <hi>Turks</hi> are not ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable
to those Embassadors who study to
do their Master the best service they can amongst
them; and besides, the declining Age of my Prince
will be some advantage to me, who is fitter for
rest and quiet, than for the News of an unnecessary
War; for their Bassas think as men. 'Tis true,
my Pains will be lessened hereby, but I count them
best bestow'd if they succeed at last.</p>
               <p>Thus Sir, I have written you a Book rather than
a Letter; whereas if I have offended you, the fault
is yours rather than mine; what I did was at your
request, and readiness to please a Friend, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
been counted a Vertue in Friendship. Yet
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:52279:137"/>
I hope these things will be as pleasant for you to
read, as they were delightful for me to write; for
let me tell you, as soon as I put Pen to Paper, I
love to be prolix, that so I may as it were deceive
my Confinement; that I may wander abroad in my
Mind, and be Conversant with you as in Presence.
VVhat things seem frivolous and needless, you must
take them as proceeding by word of Mouth in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
Conferences amongst Friends. Men may be
allow'd to tittle tattle in a Letter as well as
in common Discourse; if I were to write Inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for Churches and Temples, to be seen of all
Men, Circumspection and care must be used, but
not when I write to you and a few priv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

I aim not at Fame; if my Lines please you, I have
enough. You will say perhaps I might have writ
better Latin; I grant it, but what if it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
my Ability; it was not for want of any good
will; and yet let me tell you, what good Latin
can come out of uncouth <hi>Greece</hi> or barbarous
<hi>Turky?</hi> If you take my Lines in good part, I shall

               </opener>
               <p>I Acknowledge your Kindness and antient
Respect, in congratulating my Return;
and whereas you require an Account of
the residue of my Embassy, and what Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
have happen'd since my last to you, I
will remember my Promise to you, and I shall
not disoblige so choice a Friend; take them
all in a Medly together, what comes next to
Hand, as my Memory suggests the things
more, and things less serious. My beginning is
with the Mournful; it is this. I was scarce
settled in my Spirit which was troubled for
<hi>Bajazet</hi>'s Misfortune and Death, when lo, I
was struck with another Message as sorrowful
as that. We were all in a great expectation
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:52279:138"/>
of the Success of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Fleet, which sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
towards the Isle of <hi>Meniage,</hi> (now called
<hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rse,</hi>) upon News that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
there. For <hi>Solyman</hi> (being advertised
that <hi>Bland</hi> was taken by the <hi>Christians,</hi> and
that they had added new Fortifications to the
old Castle therein, in which they had yet a
very strong Garrison,) could not endure to
be thus check'd in the midst of all the Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perities
of his flourishing Empire. Hereupon
he equipp'd a Navy with Auxiliaries to relieve
those that were <hi>Mahumetans</hi> like himself; and
made <hi>Bana</hi> Commander of his Fleet. He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
his Ships with a Select Company of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and yet was doubtful of the Event; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Voyage was long, and they were to
engage with an Enemy redoubled for Valour.
For you may please to be inform'd, that the
<hi>Turks</hi> for a long time have had a great Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Valour of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that they have waged great Wars, and
came off with good Success. They had heard
of the Emperor <hi>Charles,</hi> and of his Son <hi>Philip</hi>
the Heir of his Valour as well as his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.
The report of this Power made the
<hi>Turks</hi> very solicitous; so that those that went
the Voyage, made their last Wills, as if they
should never return to <hi>Constantinople</hi> again.
Thus the whole City, both those that went,
and those that staid at Home, was filled with
anxiety. But alas, their Fleet sailed with a
prosperous Gale, and came upon the <hi>Christians</hi>
unawares; which strook such a terror into
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:52279:138"/>
them, that they knew not how to Fight or
Fly: Some nimble Vessels made their Escape;
the rest were either taken by the Enemy, or
split or dash'd in pieces on the Sands. The
Duke of <hi>Medina</hi> the General, and <hi>Iohn An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
Donna</hi> the Admiral, fled to the castle,
from whence they escap'd in a dark Night
undiscovered through the Enemies Fleet to
<hi>Sicily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pitual</hi> sent hither a Galley to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of this Victory, and as a Testimony
thereof, he caused a Bannet, wherein was the
Image of our Saviour Christ upon the Cross,
to be pulled along the Sea, at the poop of the
Vessel. As soon as it arrived in the Haven, the
Loss of the <hi>Christians</hi> was presently divulged,
and the <hi>Turks</hi> congratulated one another for
their Victory. They came thick and three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
to my Door, and asked my Servants in
a Jeer, whether they had any Brother or
other Friend in the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet: if you had,
said they, you may shortly have the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of seeing their Faces here.</p>
               <p>Besides, they highly extoll'd their own Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and blam'd the Cowardise of the <hi>Christians.</hi>
Who, say they, shall now be able to
stand before us, seeing we have Conquered
the <hi>Spaniards?</hi> My People were forced to hear
this sad News to their great Grief; but Gods
Will must be done: Our only hope was, that
the Castle in which was a strong Garrison,
might hold out against the <hi>Turks</hi> till Winter,
or some other Accident had rais'd the Siege.
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:52279:139"/>
And yet our Hopes were mix'd with Fears,
that the Conqueror would take that too;
and so it fell out, for the Besieged wanted all
things, especially Water; so than <hi>Don Alveras
de Sande,</hi> the Governour thereof, a Stout Man,
Couragious Person, and an Old Soldier, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
that it was no longer recoverable, with
a <hi>Iew</hi> in his Company, got a Boat, and made
his Escape towards <hi>Sicily,</hi> that so he might
not behold the Surrender of so important a
Place, which he thought would be look'd upon
as a Blot in his Escutcheon, though the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamest
necessity had compelled it. When he
was gone, the Soldiers opened the Gates, and
let in the <hi>Turks,</hi> hoping to find them the
more merciful, because of their easie admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
But <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Castile</hi> would by no
means leave the Fort which he commanded,
but he (and his Brother) valiantly repulsing
the Enemy, was at last wounded and taken.
The Castle was stoutly defended by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
for Three Months space, though they
wanted many Necessaries, and which was the
worst of all, had no prospect of Relief.
The Weather was hot, and they almost parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Thirst. They had but one Cistern
to hold Water in, which was not big enough
to serve them all; so that they were compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to weigh out their Water by Measure,
only enough for a single Man to keep Life
and Soul together. This Cistern Water was
increased with a mixture of Sea-Water, and
by some curious Art made fresh. This Secret
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:52279:139"/>
was told them by a certain Alchymist:
But all had not that faculty or opportunity;
for you should see some lye parching on the
Ground, ready to give up the Ghost for very
Thirst, saying as well as they could speak,
<hi>Water, Water;</hi> and if a little was brought,
they were relieved for the present, but when
that Moysture was spent, then they relapsed
to their former Drought, and dyed thereof.
Thus many perished, besides the Wounded,
who could have no help of Chyrurgery to
cure them in that desolate place.</p>
               <p>In the Month of <hi>September,</hi> the Victorious
Navy of the <hi>Turks</hi> returned to <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
bringing the <hi>Christians</hi> Captives, with their
Gallies along with them; a joyful Spectacle
to the <hi>Turks,</hi> but a sad one to the <hi>Christians</hi>
that lived amongst them. That Night it lay
at Anchor near the Rocks over against <hi>By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zantium,</hi>
that so they might enter the Port
the next Day in greater Pomp and Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour.
<hi>Solyman</hi> came down into an Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in his Gardens near the Sea-side, that
from thence he might see the Prisoners en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
in. <hi>Don Alveras de Sande</hi> was in the
Poop of his Admiral Galley, and with him
<hi>Don Sanctius de Leydia,</hi> and <hi>Don Belliger de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quemus,</hi>
one Commander of the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys,
the other of the <hi>Neopolitan.</hi> The Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys
of the <hi>Christians</hi> were despoiled of their
Ornaments, as Streamers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and hall'd in
Barques, that they might appear base and
contemptible in the sight of the <hi>Turks.</hi> They
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:52279:140"/>
who observ'd <hi>Solyman</hi>'s Countenance that time
say, that they perceived no sign of Insolent
Mirth therein. This is certain, that when I
saw him going to his Devotion the next day,
his Countenance was not altered from its u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
hue, as if that Victory had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
him at all; so well was this cunning
old Man able to bear the breath of his smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Fortune, that he was unmov'd under
it.</p>
               <p>The Prisoners were afterwards brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> but so miserably hunger-starv'd
before, that some could not stand on their
Legs, others fell down in a Swoon for very
feebleness; others had Arms in a Jeer put upon
them, in which posture they died; the <hi>Turks</hi>
insulting over them on every hand, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
to themselves the Empire of the whole
World; for who now shall be able to stand
before us, (said they,) seeing we have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the <hi>Spaniards?</hi> There was a Commander
in the <hi>Turkish</hi> Fleet, with whom I had some
Acquaintance, who had taken the great Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> Galleys, being Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Eagles embracing one another; being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
that he was about to present it to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman,</hi>
I thought good to prevent him; and
sending him Two Silver Tasters, I obtained
the Banner, that so the Ensign of <hi>Charles</hi> the
Fifth might not remain in the Hands of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,
to the eternal Infamy of the Christian
Name.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:52279:140"/>
There were amongst the Prisoners, besides
those above mentioned, these Two Eminent
Persons, <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Cordona,</hi> the Son in
Law of <hi>Don Bellinger,</hi> and <hi>Don Gasto,</hi> the Son
of the Duke of <hi>Medina,</hi> who though but a Youth,
yet had a noble employment in his Fathers
Army. <hi>Don Iohn</hi> promised to give a great
Sum of Money to be left Prisoner at <hi>Chios,</hi>
(which was inhabited by old <hi>Genoeses,</hi>) which
was accordingly done. As for <hi>Don Gasto,</hi> he
was hid by <hi>Pihulius,</hi> in hopes to have a large
Price for his Redemption; which design of
his had almost proved his overthrow: For
<hi>Solyman</hi> by some means or other smelt out the
Cheat, and was grievously vex'd that <hi>Pihulius</hi>
should serve him such a Trick; so that at the
Instigation also of <hi>Rustan Gasto,</hi> he was sought
after, that so <hi>Pihulius</hi> might be punished;
but <hi>Gasto</hi> died in the Search, some say of the
Plague, others by the procurement of <hi>Pihu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
himself, that he might tell no Tales. This
is certain, upon the most diligent search, he
could not be found. However <hi>Pihulius</hi> was
afraid to come to <hi>Constantinople</hi> to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his angry Master, lest he might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned
there; but he hovered with a few
Galleys about several Islands of the <hi>Aegaean</hi>
Sea, pretending divers Excuses for so doing.
But at last <hi>Solyman</hi> by the perswasion of the
chief Eunuch of his Son <hi>Selymus,</hi> gave him his
Pardon in these Words, <hi>I for my part forgive
him his great Offence, but God Almighty the just
Revenger of all Wickedness, inflict just Punishment
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:52279:141"/>
on him in the Life to come:</hi> So strongly are the
<hi>Turks</hi> perswaded, that no evil Fact should
pass unpunished.</p>
               <p>But for <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Cardona,</hi> he fared bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
for by the care of <hi>Adam</hi> a <hi>Dissicksleim,</hi>
Baron of <hi>Austria,</hi> who Married his Sister, and
by my sponsion for him, he returned safe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Spain.</hi> As for <hi>Don Sanders,</hi> he was brought
into the <hi>Divan,</hi> and there <hi>Rustan</hi> demanded
of him, what his Master meant by invading
other Mens Rights, when he could not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his own. <hi>Sanders</hi> answered, The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
belonged not to him to answer, 'twas
his part only to execute his Masters Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
as faithfully as he could, wherein For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
had been against him. However he beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the Bassa upon his Knees, in regard he
had a Wife and Children at Home, that they
would speak a good Word for him. So <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman
Rustan</hi> answered, that their Emperor
was of a Merciful Disposition, and that they
would intercede for him. Thus was he sent
Prisoner to the Castle called <hi>Caradenis:</hi> He
was not gone far, but he was sent for back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
because the chief of the Bed-Chamber
had not seen him; a Man of a greater Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
with his Prince. Upon this Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
some say, that though otherwise Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant,
he was a little faint-hearted, as fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he was brought back to his End; but it
proved otherwise. As for the other prisoners,
the chief of them, as <hi>Sauchims de Leyva</hi> with
his Two Natural Sons, and <hi>Don Bellinger</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:52279:141"/>
were sent into the Castle of <hi>Pera,</hi> or <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lata.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As soon as I was made acquainted with
their Condition, and in what want of all
things they were, I thought it my Duty to do
my best to relieve them; and thereupon I
sent some to comfort them, and to promise
them all good Offices that lay in my power.
And from that Day forward, my House was
a common Receptacle for all the Prisoners;
and I did them all the Kindness I could. For
you must know, that the <hi>Turks</hi> think their
Prisoners well enough provided for, if they
allow them Bread and Water; they have no
regard to any Mans Age or Condition, or to
the time of the Year, whether they be Sick
or Well, Healthy or Crazy, Old or Young,
'tis all one to them, they are all treated af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
one and the same manner. Hereupon, I
was forced to provide several sorts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefs,
for several necessities, different Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases
requiring different Cures. There lay
a great Company of Sick Persons in a certain
Temple of <hi>Pera,</hi> a Town over against <hi>Byzan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi>
whom the <hi>Turks</hi> cast out as Abjects; and
many of them perished for want of conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
Pottage to relieve their Sick Stomachs,
and recover their lost Strength; when I was
told thereof, I dealt with a Friend of mine,
a Citizen of <hi>Pera,</hi> desiring him to buy some
Weather Sheep every day, and boiling of
them at his own House, to distribute the Flesh
to some, and the Broth to others, as their
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:52279:142"/>
Stomachs could bear; which was a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
to abundance of them. But those which
were in Health, required another sort of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief;
my House was full from Morning to
Night with several Complaints; some were
used to good Diet, and a piece of brown
Bread which was their daily Allowance, would
not go down so well with them; some that
used to drink Wine, could not bear the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
use of Water only; some wanted
Blankets to cover them, as being never used
to lye on the bare Ground; some wanted
Coats, others Shooes; but the most part de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ome Footing to gratifie their Keepers,
that they might deal the more Mercifully with
them. Money was the only Remedy for these
Mischiefs, so that every day some Guilders
were expended by me on these accounts. But
these Expences were tolerable, compared with
greater Sums which were desired of me; or
else they prayed me to be their Surety for
payment of their Ransom Money; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
every one was very forward with his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences;
one alledged Nobleness of Birth; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
that he had great Friends and Alliances;
a Third, that he was a Commander in the
Army, and had much Pay due to him; a
Fourth, that he had Cash enough at Home,
and was able to make repayment. Some boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of their Valour in the Fight; every one
had something to say for himself. When I
demanded of them whether they would be
sure to repay me? God forbid said they,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:52279:142"/>
for what more unjust, than to defraud a
Man who hath restored us to our Liberty,
even out of the Jaws of Death?</p>
               <p>And the truth is, it was very grievous to
me, to hear a Man come and tell me, unless
I can lay down 200 Guilders for my Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I am undone for ever; I shall be sent
over into <hi>Asia</hi> to be made a Galley-Slave, to
tug at the Oar, without any hope to see my
own Country again: There is a Merchant
Sir, that will deposite Wares amounting to that
value, provided you will promise repayment.
This was the Allegation of almost all of
them; which could not but affect me, as
knowing it to be most true, That if they
were not relieved, many of them must needs
perish; and none could better do it, nor could
they more justly expect it from any Man than
my self. But, you will say, 'tis not good
trusting any Body living; to which I answer,
Can any Man be so prodigiously ungrateful,
as not to repay what was laid out to save his
Life; and grant that One or Two may not
have ability to reimburse me, what's that to
the purpose. 'Tis not lost, that which is laid
out to relieve the Oppressed. But sure the
greater part of them will perform their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.
For these Reasons I was induced to pass
my word for 1000 Ducats, which hath made
me so much in Debt, that I know not how to
get out; but I fear have freed them from Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and clap'd them on my own Legs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:52279:143"/>
I am the larger on this Subject, both to
purge my self from too much facility, which
I know some will accuse me of, in being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to believe every body; and also in some
measure to blame my self for the slackness of
some in their repayments whom I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken.
For I foresee I shall be a great
Loser by the Business; for I must necessarily
make Payment on the Day, when my Word
was once passed: And besides, I heard that
some whom I had Released, had Laughed at
my Craziness, in believing what they said
to be true; so that my case is but bad, if
I should judge of the rest by them. But be
it as it will, I thank my God, that I have
been able to do so many good Offices to so
many distressed Persons; I do not repent it,
for Vertue is a sufficient Reward to it self. I
covet not that any Honours should be confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
on me, nor any Statue erected for my
Beneficence; my utmost ambition is, that they
would be so grateful, as to pay me what I
laid out of Purse, to save their lives; of
which I despair not from so cordial a Nation
as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are. For my part, I rejoyce
not only that I did them a good turn, but
that thereby I gave an Example and Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-to
others to do the same.</p>
               <p>There live many Merchants in <hi>Pera, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi>
by Stock, who are very assistant in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Christian-Prisoners; but one of them
deserves to be particularly mentioned by me,
for the absurdity of his Opinion, differing
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:52279:143"/>
from all the rest. He was an <hi>Italian Greek,
(i e.)</hi> one that resembles both those Nations
in his Birth and Manners. When his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
Men were mercifully busied in relieving
Prisoners, he could never be perswaded to
give one Farthing towards so pious a Work;
and being blamed for it, his Answer was,
(which he uttered in a barbarous and blunt
<hi>Italian</hi> Style, the <hi>Greek</hi> being more familiar
to him,) I know not, says he, what these
Men are; but this I know, that the just Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God hath brought them into this
miserable Condition; for my part, I will not
oppose the Will of God, let them abide in
that place God hath set them; you who do
boldly withstand what God hath decreed,
may pity them if you please: But I will not
spare a Doit to release them, though you use
never so many Arguments to perswade me.
But enough of this vain and foolish Opiniator.
This Loss at Sea, together with the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> struck a great Terror into
me, that the <hi>Turks</hi> made more insolent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
would hearken to almost no Conditions
of Peace. This publick Calamity was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded
by a private one; the Plague had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
my House; one of my Faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
died thereof, and the rest were terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
afraid of the Infection.</p>
               <p>But before I speak of that, there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
case surprised me, arising on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:52279:144"/>
                  <hi>Solyman</hi> grows every day more Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
than other in the Rites of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
he was wont to delight himself in Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
and in the chanting of Young Singers,
but all this was laid aside, by means of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
old Sybil, noted for Sanctity, who told
him, that if he left not off that sport, he
would be severely punished after his Death.
He was so moved herewith, that he cast his
Musical Instruments, though richly studded
with Gold and Jewels, into the Fire and burnt
them. And whereas he formerly eat his Meat
out of Silver Dishes, now he was perswaded
to use none but Earthen Platters; he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
over-perswaded by her to abridge the use
of Wine, wherein he was told a great liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was used, which his Prophet would be
angry at, if he suffer'd it. Hereupon an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
was published, that for the future no Wine
should be imported into <hi>Constantinople,</hi> either
to Christians or <hi>Iews</hi> either.</p>
               <p>This Edict did much concern me and mine,
who were never wont to drink Water; and
what other Liquor could we have, if Wine
were forbid. Our long absence from our
Country, and the uncertain issue of Embassy,
were a sufficient Mortification to us, without
this other Inconvenience of change of Diet,
which must needs indanger our Health. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I desired my Interpreters to intercede
for me in the <hi>Divan,</hi> that I might retain my
antient Right. The Bassa's Men were of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Opinions in the case; some alledged,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:52279:144"/>
we ought to be content with Water as well
as they; for what would the Neighbourhood
say, if <hi>Christians</hi> may drink Wine, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
be severely forbid the use of it. If
<hi>Christians</hi> in the midst of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> might
ingurgate what Wine they please, the stink
thereof will spread far and near, and profane
all; yea, the Mussul-men themselves, when
they came to us, would return belching out
the smell of Wine.</p>
               <p>Hereupon we were likely to be cast in our
Case; but at last a more favourable Opinion,
<hi>viz.</hi> Of those who plead that the sudden
change would be insufferable for us, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
many Diseases, if not Death it self.
Whereupon we were allowed the Freedom of
one Night, to get in what Wine we could,
which was brought to the nearest Landing-place,
from whence we were furnished with
Horsed Carriage to convey it to my Lodging
with as little Observation as might be, all
being done in the Night. Thus I stor'd my
self, and kept my Priviledge.</p>
               <p>Some of the <hi>Grecians</hi> played a pretty prank
with the Sultan on this account, when they
knew that he was to pass through a Road
full of Vineyards on both sides, they set a
great many Labourers at work to root out
the Vines; some of them they lay in the
High-way; others they loaded on Carts. The
Emperor passing by, and demanding the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for so doing, they answered, That seeing
by his Edict they were forbid the use of
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:52279:145"/>
Wine, they were cutting down their Vines to
make Fuel for the Fire. For shame, says <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman</hi>
forbear, you do not understand my
Command aright; though I forbid the use of
Wine, yet I allow the eating of Grapes, as
one of the best Fruits that God hath allotted
to Mankind; only you are not to express and
adulterate their Juice, nor tun it up in Hogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,
and so make it quite another thing.
What will you cut down Apple-trees also, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they bear not Wine? Get you gone you
Buzards, and spare your Vines. Thus the
<hi>Greeks</hi> were fool'd in their Project.</p>
               <p>But to return to the Story of the Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
which was within the Walls of my
House; whereupon I went to <hi>Rustan</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
leave for me and my Family to remove,
and to go into a less contagious Air; this I
desired not with any great confidence of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
my Request, (for I knew the Rigid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Opinion,) but only shewing care
for the Health of my Family. He answered
the Messenger, he would acquaint <hi>Solyman</hi> with
my Desire, and if I came the next day, I
should have his Answer. Accordingly I sent
and received this Answer from him; the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
wondered what I meant, in desiring to
move my Habitation; is not the Pestilence
God's Arrow, which will always hit his Mark?
If God would visit me herewith, how could
I avoid it? Is not the Plague said he, in my
own Palace, and yet I do not think of remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving?
And therefore he wish'd me to abide;
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:52279:145"/>
where I was forced to stay in a Pestilential
and Infected House.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Rustan</hi> dying of a Dropsie soon after,
and <hi>Haly,</hi> then Second Vizier of the Bench
succeeded him, a Prudent and Courteous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
as any was amongst the <hi>Turks,</hi> I sent him a
Present, a large Garment of Silk, in way of
Congratulating his new Dignity. He returned
me this Courteous Answer, That he would
always be my Friend, and upon any occasion
I should not scruple to make my Address to
him. And I found him as good as his Word,
for when my House a while after was re-vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited
with the Plague, which swept away
many of my Servants, and amongst others,
my chief Physitian: I sent the same Message
to <hi>Haly</hi> which I had done to <hi>Rustan</hi> before;
who answered me, for his part he was very
willing I should remove my Habitation, but
that it were better for me to ask leave of
the Sultan himself, least said he, if he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
light upon any of your Servants walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at random up and down, he should take
it in great disdain that so much liberty was
granted them without his knowledge: And
yet, proceeded he, I shall propound the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
so cautiously to the Prince, that I do not
doubt of his Assent. And accordingly soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I received a Message from him, that I
might remove whither I pleased. Whereupon
I chose an Island called <hi>Principo,</hi> for my Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
about Four Hours sail from <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi>
It was the pleasantest of all the little
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:52279:146"/>
Isles contiguous to that City, for the rest
have no Village at all in them, or but one
at most, but this has Two.</p>
               <p>The Physician I lately told you of, died at
my House of a Plague, it was my old Friend
Dr. <hi>Williams,</hi> the choice Companion of my
long and tedious Pilgrimage: The occasion
of the Sickness was this, It seems amongst
the rest of the Prisoners I had redeemed one,
as the Event declared, who was Sick of the
Plague. My Physitian did assiduously attend
him, till he got the Infection himself; for he
was guilty of that singularity of Opinion,
that there was more Fear than Danger; for
at the same time, said he, there are wont to
arise other Diseases, which Men are apt to
think is the Pestilence; so that Pestilential
Remedies are usually applied to every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Sore or Boyl; thus he flattered himself
though he was deeply infected; yet he did
not suspect it to be the Plague till it was past
Remedy, and he was ready to dye under the
Hands of his Attendance. The Day before
he died, he sent me word he was better; and
desired to see me, if I pleased to bestow a
Visit upon him: I did so, and sat a great while
by his Bed-side; he related to me how ill he
had been, and that his Sight as well as his
other Senses had been so weakened, that he
knew no Body; but now said he, my Senses
are restored, and if I could be freed from
my Distillation that hinders my Breath, I
should be presently well; and at my Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:52279:146"/>
I told him that I heard that he had a
rising in his Breast; I have so, says he, and
thereupon he threw aside his Blanket, and
shewed me his Breast; but there is no danger
says he, in it, for it came from buttoning my
Doublet which I put on too strait. Towards
the Evening according to custom, I sent Two
of my Servants to watch with him, who while
they were putting on him a clean Shirt, he
himself espied a Purple Spot in his Breast,
which they told him was but a Flea-bite;
and by and by he discovered more and greater
ones. No, said he, These are not Flea-bites,
but Tokens of approaching Death; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us spend this Night in Prayer and
holy Conference preparatory to my latter end,
which he did, and in the Morning with full
assurance of God's Mercy, he departed this
Life.</p>
               <p>Thus was I bereaved of my special Bosom
Friend, and the common Wealth of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
had also a great loss of him; for he had
made Observations in his Travels which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to publish, and would have been very
useful to the World, if Death had not prevented
his laudable Design. His Skill and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
was so much prized by me, that if the
times had suffered me to return, I knew none
fitter to leave in my place at <hi>Constantinople</hi>
than himself, had he out-lived me.</p>
               <p>After his Death, my Cares seemed to be
doubled, nay, if I should have left them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
I had returned but half my self as it
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:52279:147"/>
were. Well, his Soul is at rest, and I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
a Monument, as a due testimony to
his Vertue. But to return to our Island.</p>
               <p>I lived there very pleasantly for Three
Months. It was a private Place, without any
trouble or noise; there were only a few <hi>Greeks,</hi>
with whom I diverted my self; but never
a <hi>Turk</hi> to interrupt my Mirth. As for the
<hi>Turks</hi> of my Houshold, they created no trouble
to me, I might go whither I would, and pass
from one of these Islands to another at my
pleasure, without any molestation from them.
There grew there several sorts of Plants, as
Lavender, Sharp-pointed Myrtle, Cotton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weed,
and abundance more. The Sea full of
divers sorts of Fishes, which I took sometimes
with Net, sometimes with Hook and Line.
Several <hi>Grecian</hi> Fishers with their Boats at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
me, and where we had hopes of the
greatest sport, thither we sailed, and cast our
Nets. Sometimes we played above board,
and when we saw a Crab or a Lobster at the
bottom, where the Sea was very clear, we
would run him through with a Fish-spear,
and so hale him up into a Vessel. But our
best and most profitable sport, was with a
drag Net, where we thought most Fish were,
there we cast it in a round; it took up a
great compass, with the long Ropes tied to
ends thereof, which were to draw it to Land.
To those Ropes the Seamen tied green Boughs
very thick, that so the Fish might be Fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and not seek to Escape. Thus we brought
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:52279:147"/>
great Sholes of trembling Fishes near the
Shore. And yet in this danger they were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
instigated how to save themselves;
some would leap over the Net, others would
cover themselves in the Sand that they might
not be taken; others strove to bite the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes
of the Net, though made of course
Flax or Hemp, of which kind were the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodontes,</hi>
Fish armed with strong Teeth, and
if one made way for himself, all would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him, and so the whole Draught would
escape, and not a Fish left for the Fisher.
To remedy this inconvenience, (for I was
aware thereof,) I stood with a Pole in my
Hand, beating the Water, that I might keep
the Fish from biting the Net. At which
my Attendants could not choose but laugh,
yet for all this many of them escaped. So
sagacious are Fishes where they are in extream
danger. Yet notwithstanding the Fugitives, we
brought a great many Fishes ashore, a Sea-Bream,
Scorpion-Fishes, Dragon-Fishes, Scare-Fish,
Jule-Fish, Chane or Ruff-Fishes, whose
variety did delight my Eye, and the enquiry
into their Nature, did hugely please my Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:
So that at Night I came with my trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
Vessel laden with Prey. The next day
I presented <hi>Hali</hi> Bassa, and his chief Steward,
with part of my Acquests, who took it very
kindly at my Hands.</p>
               <p>Sometimes I took delight with an Iron Spear
made on purpose to catch Shrimps or Cramps,
which are there so thick, as if they grew in

                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:52279:149"/>
that Sea: Where I observed the Master-Shrimps
lying Two by Two, the Male and
the Female, and sometimes more of them, of
which <hi>Cicero, Plini</hi> and <hi>Athenaeus</hi> speak so much<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
I confess, I think some of these Relations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them are rather Fabulous than true:
For they say, that this Shell-Fish doth gape
in order to catch other small Fishes, and when
she hath got them, yet she shuts not her Shell
till the <hi>Pinnophylax</hi> bite it, and by this warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
she closes her Shell, and with her Mouth
the <hi>Pinnophylax</hi> divided her Prey. The
Figure of these <hi>Pinnae</hi> you have in <hi>Bellonius.</hi>
The sharp part of it sticks in the bottom of
the Sea, as if it grew there; and by these
sticking Fibres, she draws in her Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as appears by this, that when she is
loosed from her hold, she dies for want of
Sustenance, as Herbs and Plants do. And it
is probable, that the <hi>Pinnophylax</hi> chose this
sort, as a Defence against other ravenous
Fishes, where it may lye quiet even in stormy
Weather, and go in and out at her pleasure.
Yet I speak not this, to detract from the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of those worthy Authors I mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
but only to leave the matter to more
curious Enquirers. We quickly laded our
Boat with these <hi>Pinnae,</hi> they are but a course
Fare, like Muscles, of which you would be
soon weary; but the Fishermen advised me
to keep the <hi>Pinnophylaxes</hi> apart, for they would
make a goodly, wholsom, and graceful Dish.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:52279:149"/>
Amongst the rest of the Islands, there is
one untilled and uninhabited, whither all
sorts of Monsters do resort, Star-Fish, Saw-Fish,
Grape-Fish, Sea-Horses, Prodigious
Cockles, a round yellow Fish like an Orange;
no ordinary Fish there, but Thornback, and
a certain Fork-Fish, with a terrible Prickle.
I remember we took one of them, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
at us, run her self through.</p>
               <p>When tempestuous Weather hindered me
to see the Sea, then I delighted my self to find
out strange and unusual Plants at Land. I
would sometimes go afoot all over the Island,
having a young <hi>Franciscan</hi> Monk in my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
a Jolly Fellow, but very Fat, and not
used to travel on Foot; I took him out of
a Monastry of <hi>Pera</hi> to be my Partner in my
Walks; he was so corpulent and pursy, that
when I went on pace to catch my self an
Heat, he would follow me at a distance pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and blowing, with these Words in his
Mouth, What need all this haste? Whom do
we run from, or whom do we pursue? What
are we Carriers or Posts that must make speed
to deliver some important Letters? Thus he
mutter'd, till the very Sweat pierced through
all his Cloaths. In fine, when we came back
to our Lodging, he threw himself upon his
Bed, wofully complaining, and crying out,
he was undone: What Injury have I done,
said he, that you thus go about to destroy me?
And in this fretting Posture we had much ado
to perswade him to eat a bit for his Dinner.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:52279:150"/>
Now and then some Friends visited me from
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> and from <hi>Pera;</hi> yea, and some
<hi>Germans</hi> also of <hi>Haly</hi>'s own Family; of whom
when I asked whether the Plague was abated?
Mightily, said they? How many then die in
a day? Almost Five Hundred, said they. Good
God, quoth I, call you that to abate, when
then doth it rage? They replied, when about
a Thousand or Twelve Hundred die in a Day.
The <hi>Turks</hi> entertain this Opinion concerning
the Pestilence, that every Man's Destiny is
writ by God in his Forehead; so that 'tis a
foolish thing in them, to think to decline or
avoid it. This Opinion makes them fearless
of the Plague, but not secure from it. So
that as soon as ever any Man dies of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence,
they will take off his Cloaths yet
sweaty, and Linnen, and rub their Faces with
them. If it be the Will of God, say they,
that I shall dye this way, it will most certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
come to pass, if not, it will not hurt me.
Thus a large Field is open for Infection; so
that whole Families are sometimes swept away
by that Disease. Whilst I abode in these
Islands, I got acquaintance with one <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes,</hi>
a <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> who presided over a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastry
in <hi>Chalcis,</hi> one of those Islands; he
was a Learned and a Vertuous Man, very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
of agreement between the <hi>Latine</hi> and
the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches; so that he differed from
the Humour of the rest of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who
esteem the <hi>Latins</hi> as Men of an impure and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
Sect; so much doth every Man abound in
his own Sense.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:52279:150"/>
When I had lived about two Months in
those Islands, some of the Bassa's began to
suspect my long Absence, and told <hi>Haly,</hi> that
perhaps I might make my escape, for I had
Ships ready at my command, and other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
might easily be procured; and
therefore it was more advisable I should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into the City. He answered them, He
had that Confidence in my Word, that he
believed I designed no such thing. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
he sent a <hi>Chiaux</hi> to me to advertise
me thereof: The <hi>Chiaux</hi> very cunningly pried
about to see if he could discover the least
Preparation for an Escape, but finding none,
after I had presented him, he returned to his
Master with his Message from me, That he
might rest secure, for I never intended to
break my Word. Thus I continued three
Months in my Retirement, and returned of
my own accord into the City without any
Compulsion.</p>
               <p>Form that time forward I had a great
Familiarity with <hi>Haly,</hi> and our Discourse
was still of Peace: He is a <hi>Dalmatian</hi> by Birth,
and the only Courteous Man I found in that
Barbarous Country: His Nature Mild and
Gentle; his Person of easie Access; he is of
a deep Understanding, capable of managing
the greatest Affairs, having much Skill in
<hi>Military</hi> as well as <hi>Political Matters,</hi> for he is
an old Man, and hath passed through the
greatest Offices of that Common-wealth. His
Stature is Tall, and his Countenance filled
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:52279:151"/>
with a lovely Gravity: He hath a mighty
Love for his Master, and consults by all
means imaginable his Repose in his Old and
Sickly Age. What <hi>Rustan</hi> thought to do
by Austerity, Severeness and Minatory Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
that <hi>Haly</hi> endeavours to compass
by Mildness, Moderation and Friendship.
<hi>Rustan</hi> was always Severe, Fierce, Self-will'd,
his Word must pass for a Law: 'Tis true,
he knew well enough his own Circumstances,
and what the Times did exact of him, and
what the Old Age of his Prince required; but
he was afraid, that if he carried himself com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyingly,
either in Word or Deed, the Vogue
would be, he did it out of Covetousness, of
which he was vulgarly suspected: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
though he was desirous of a Peace, yet
he would abate nothing of his wonted Stiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
but if Propositions were offered to him,
not pleasing to his Fancy, he would almost
thrust a Man out of Doors; so that I scarce
ever parted from him but in an angry Mood.
One time when I was treating with him of
Peace, if I had nothing else to say, he bid me
<hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e gone:</hi> I presently rose up and went my
way, only telling him, <hi>That I could propose
no other Conditions than what my Master allowed
me to do.</hi> Which words I pronouncing with
more Fervour and Passion than I was wont to
do, he called back my Interpreter and asked
him, Whether I were Angry? He answered,
<hi>No. What,</hi> said he, <hi>if I should obtain what he
desires of the</hi> Sultan, <hi>dost thou think he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:52279:151"/>
his Word to me, in presenting me with the
Sum he promised me? No question,</hi> said the
<hi>Drugger-man, but he will be as good as his
Word to a Tittle. Then,</hi> says <hi>Rustan, go home
and ask him.</hi> I had then 5000 Ducats, which
make 6000 Crowns, lying by me for any
sudden Emergency; I loaded my Interpreter
with them, and bid him carry that to <hi>Rustan,</hi>
and tell him, That this Sum was but the
Earnest of what I had promised him, but the
rest would follow, if my Negotiation were
brought to an Happy Issue, for by no means
would I be worse than my Word. He seem'd
to be pleased with the sight of the Mony, but
returned it again to me, bidding my <hi>Drugger-man</hi>
to tell me, That he no ways doubted of
my Faithfulness, but the Matter of the Peace
stood yet on Ambiguous Terms; neither could
he certainly promise a good Issue, for he did
not fully know his Master's Mind. <hi>But let
the Embassador,</hi> said he, <hi>keep it for me, as my
Treasurer, till he sees the Event.</hi> Thus was the
Mony brought me back again; and <hi>Rustan</hi>
died a while after.</p>
               <p>Here give me leave to acquaint you with
the Bounty of my Master, the best of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors;
for that Mony lying dead by me, I
acquainted his Imperial Majesty, That I would
lay it out for one Years Expence (which
amounted to just as much) in my Embassy.
But I repented afterwards of this my Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
especially considering what Pains I had
taken in my Imployment for so many Years
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:52279:152"/>
together; my Mind gave me I was Deficient
to my self, in not desiring that Sum for my
own use, seeing I knew I served a Liberal
Master, who put a just Value upon every
Man's Service, and rewarded him accordingly;
and therefore I might have desired that Mony
(which was snatch'd, as it were, out of the
Fire) for my own use; for I knew some
Courtiers would have asked greater Sums for
less Merit and Service. Upon second Thoughts
I put my Master in mind of my over-sight,
and desired his Favour, that the said Sum
might be returned intire to me: He was
graciously pleased to grant my Request, and
commanded so many Ducats to be told out
for me out of his own Exchequer: Which
Badge of his Favour, if I should be unmindful
of, I were unworthy to breath in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Air: But to return from whence I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Haly</hi> and <hi>Rustan</hi> were of quite different
Humours and Dispositions: <hi>Haly</hi> lived a
blameless Life, free from Sordidness, and
never feared that his Courteons Deportment
would procure him the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Ill-will; but
<hi>Rustan</hi> on the contrary, was a Mony-monger,
Avaricious, and his Conscience hing'd at his
Purse-strings: <hi>Rustan</hi>'s Conferences with me
were very short and Concise; but <hi>Haly</hi> would
spin out time on purpose; and that he might
entertain me the longer, he would season his
Discourse with a great deal of Facetiousness;
insomuch that the <hi>Turks,</hi> who attended on the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:52279:152"/>
account of Business or otherways, would mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
and grumble that he spent so much time
with me, that thereby they had not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
Opportunity to transact their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
with him. And the truth is, there was
somewhat of Mortification to my self in it
too, for I usually was sent for to him in the
Afternoon, and I went Fasting, that I might
be readier to deal with so acute a Man: In
our Conferences he pressed this as a Principal
Point, That each of us would propound that
which we thought most conducive to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of our Masters respectively: His Master
desired Repose in his Old Age, which was
seated with Success and Victory; and he
thought my Master also desired Peace and
Quietness; and therefore if he studied the
Tranquility of his Realm, he should by no
means rouse a sleeping Lyon. <hi>The Minds of
Princes,</hi> says he, <hi>are like Looking-glasses having
no innate shape, yet the shape of all things objected
to them pass through them; so Princes Souls, free
of themselves, are impress'd by the Images of all
things as they are represented; and therefore we
must lay nothing before them, but what is profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for their Affairs: For as good Cooks temper
their Sauces, not to this or that Man's Palate,
but for the Gust of all the Guests; so we, in
Proposition of Peace, must weigh Circumstances
on either side.</hi> This and much more did he
friendly communicate to me; yea, at all
times he shewed himself Courteous, and when
I requited his Courtesie with any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:52279:153"/>
piece of Respect, he thought himself
doubly oblig'd. Once as he was returning
from the <hi>Divan,</hi> and came to a cross way
where he was wont to salute his Fellow
<hi>Bassa</hi>'s at parting, turning his Horse too nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
and leaning on his Neck, both Horse
and Man fell to the Ground: When I heard
of his Mischance, I sent to know whether he
had got any Hurt by his Fall? He returned
me Thanks, and told me, He got no Hurt,
but 'twas usual for an Old Soldier to be apt
to Stumble and Fall. Then turning to the
By-stander: <hi>This Christian Agent,</hi> says he, <hi>has,
I thank him, a mighty Love for my Person.</hi>
Sometimes in Discourse he would tell me,
That he had got Wealth and Honour enough,
so that now he studied only to leave a Savoury
Memory behind him, by doing good to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity.</p>
               <p>When our Treaty of Peace had proceeded
on fairly a long time, and I was in good hopes
of an happy Conclusion, an unlucky Accident
hapned, which might have embarrassed the
whole Affair: A certain <hi>Greek Despot,</hi> by the
help of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Soldiers which guarded the
Frontiers of <hi>Hungary,</hi> had broke into <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davia,</hi>
and driven out the <hi>Vaivod</hi> thereof,
possessing it for himself. This Business gave
a great Alarm to the <hi>Turks,</hi> as not knowing
but such beginnings might end in greater
Mischief; and indeed the Danger was consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
though the <hi>Turks</hi> thought it Prudence
to dissemble their Forces. <hi>Haly</hi> intended to
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:52279:153"/>
speak with me about it, as I understood by
one of his Domesticks; and accordingly he
sent for me a few hours after: I confess I
was somewhat troubled at the Message; I was
afraid, that my Negociation being in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
way to a good Issue, this Matter would
spoil all. When I came, he entertain'd me
with his wonted Courtesie, and after much
Discourse tending to the concluding of the
Peace, he shew'd no sign of Discontent at all
in his Countenance, till I was just about to
take my leave of him and go away, then he
bid me sit down again, for something was
come to his Memory which he had forgot:
<hi>Don't you hear,</hi> said he, <hi>that your</hi> Germans
<hi>have made an Inroad into</hi> Moldavia? <hi>No,</hi> said
I, <hi>neither do I believe it; for how should the</hi>
Germans <hi>come to a place so remote from them as</hi>
Moldavia? <hi>'Tis most certainly true,</hi> said he, <hi>I
have it by several Expresses, and I will send one
of your own Country</hi> Germans <hi>to convince you of
the Truth thereof.</hi> This Onset gave me occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to tell him, That if any of this were
true, I was sure it was not done by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
or Command of my Master <hi>Caesar. The</hi>
Germans, said I, <hi>are a Free People, and used
to serve other Nations in their War; and perhaps
some of them had taken Pay under Forreigners:
But, in my Iudgment, the Cause of these Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
arise from the</hi> Hungarian <hi>Nobles of that
Neighbourhood, who being provoked by the daily
Injuries of the</hi> Turks, <hi>labour to cry Quiet with
them. And to speak the Truth, I think they are
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:52279:154"/>
not much to be blamed, if upon so great Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
they labour to revenge themselves; do not
your Soldiers do so on the Borders of</hi> Hungary?
<hi>What Plunderings and Devastations do they
make in the Emperor's Territories there? Here
we talk of Peace, there is nothing but War and
Bloodshed: And for my own part, I am held as
a Prisoner, neither do my Friends know whether I
am alive or dead? And truly they that have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
so much Damage from you, are worthy rather
of Praise than Blame, if they take any Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Revenge. Let them retaliate,</hi> said <hi>Haly,
provided it be within</hi> Hungary, <hi>and the Borders
of</hi> Hungary, <hi>but 'tis intolerable they should Range
as far as</hi> Moldavia, <hi>which is but ten days Iourny
from</hi> Adrianople. To which I replied, <hi>That
Men of the Sword did not much study Points of
the Law or Civility, but used to take the first
Opportunity to revenge themselves where-ever it
was offered.</hi> Thus I departed from him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did he seem at all to be Angry, nor was
a jot more Morose in my after-Addresses to
him.</p>
               <p>During these Transactions with the Visier,
the French Embassador did me a great Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie;
there were thirteen young Gentlemen,
some <hi>Germans,</hi> some <hi>Hollanders,</hi> in Prison at
<hi>Constantinople</hi> upon this remarkable occasion;
they took Ship at <hi>Venice,</hi> in a Vessel that every
Year carried Pilgrims to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and their
<hi>Charta-part</hi> was to that purpose; some of
them travelled on the account of Religion,
others to see Forreign Countries, but they
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:52279:154"/>
all met with an unlucky Omen, for just at
the time that they landed in <hi>Syria,</hi> the <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teese</hi>
had landed some Soldiers and plunder'd
the Sea-Coast of <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> carrying away
some of the Inhabitants Prisoners: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
those <hi>Syrians</hi> who had lost Parents,
Children and Friends, having no other visible
way of Satisfaction, seiz'd on these Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in the <hi>Venetian</hi> Vessel, pretending they
were some of the Pyrates; and if they did
not procure their Friends to be released, they
should be kept in Slavery themselves: And
though they were shewed the Privilege from
the Government of <hi>Venice,</hi> and were put in
mind of the Publick Faith, and the League
betwixt them, yet all was one, away they
must be sent Prisoners to <hi>Constantinople:</hi> And
their Youth was a great Prejudice to them,
for the <hi>Bassa</hi>'s thought such young Simplings
would never undertake so long a Voyage on
the account of Religion, for the <hi>Turks</hi> never
begin their Pilgrimages till they be Ancient.</p>
               <p>When I heard of this Disaster, I did what
I could to release them, but all to no purpose.
The <hi>Bailo</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> was applied to, because
under the Protection of that Republick they
fell into this Danger: He granted 'twas all
the reason in the World they should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased;
<hi>But what Iustice,</hi> said he, <hi>can we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
among such an Inhumane and Barbarous
People?</hi> In the mean time I applied all the
Relief I was able to their distressed Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
But one day, far beyond my Expectation,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:52279:155"/>
they all came to my House, and told me,
That they were sent as a Present to me by
the French Embassador, who had obtained
their Liberty. I was mighty glad of their
Releasement, and sent great Thanks to the
Embassador, whose Name was <hi>La Vigne.</hi> The
manner was thus, when he was about to take
his leave of the Sultan, and to Kiss his Hand, as
the Custom is, he thrust a Schedule into
it, wherein he desired that the Gentlemen
might be released in Favour to his Prince,
because their Voyage was occasioned upon the
account of a Pilgrimage for Religion. <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
granted his Request, and released them
presently: Whereupon I supplied them with
Accommodations for their Voyage, and sent
them first to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and then home into their
own Country.</p>
               <p>This <hi>La Vigne</hi> at first was mighty strict
and cross to me, and used all his Arts to bring
me into the Bassa's Dislike without any
Fault of mine: He told them, I was a Subject
to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> born in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi>
and that I served the <hi>Spaniards</hi> more than the
Emperor; and that I acquainted him with
every thing that was done at <hi>Constantinople;</hi>
and that I had Emissaries in Pay, who related
to me the very Secrets of that Empire, amongst
whom was <hi>Ebrahim</hi> the chief <hi>Druggerman</hi> of
<hi>Turkey.</hi> This he did before the Peace was made
between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> but when those two
Princes were agreed, on the first opportunity
he did retract what he had spoken.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:52279:155"/>
                  <hi>La Vigne</hi> was a Man of a prodigious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to speak; he would tell all he knew,
let it be taken how it would. This made
<hi>Rustan</hi> himself to avoid his Company;
whilst at the same time others were back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to converse with <hi>Rustan,</hi> because
of the soureness of his Humour. He sent
once to <hi>Rustan</hi> to desire Audience: He told
the Messengers, his Interpreters, That he might
send his Errand by them, for his Business might
be as well done in his Absence as Presence.
Yet <hi>La Vigne</hi> would needs come himself,
where he spoke that which grated <hi>Rustan</hi>'s
Ears. <hi>What do you think,</hi> says he, <hi>that you
have got</hi> Buda, Gran, Alba Regalis, <hi>and other</hi>
Hungarian <hi>Towns, from the Christians by
Force? No, I deny it utterly, 'tis our Dissention
that gave you Opportunity to take them: If there
had not been continual Wars between the Kings
of</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Spain, <hi>you wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ld have been so
far from possessing those Towns, that</hi> Charles V.
<hi>would hardly have suffered you to live quiet at</hi>
Constantinople <hi>it self.</hi> At which Speech
<hi>Rustan</hi> was so provoked, that he told him,
<hi>What dost thou tell me of the Kings of</hi> Spain
<hi>and</hi> France; <hi>if all the Christian Princes joyn
their Arms together against my Master, he cares
not a Rush, he will easily conquer them all.</hi> And
thereupon he withdrew himself into his Bed-chamber,
and bid the Embassador be gone.
I must needs acquaint you in this place, with
the Relations I have heard concerning that
People which inhabit the <hi>Tauric-Chers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ners,</hi>
                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:52279:156"/>
who are reported to have been originally
<hi>Germans,</hi> as their Speech, Manners and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances
seem to declare; I had a great desire
to meet with any body of that Nation, from
whom I might procure some Tracts written
in that Language, but I could not obtain it;
yet at last I met with an Accident which in
part satisfied my Desires: There came two
Envoys from that Nation to the Sultan, to
make some Complaints or other; and my
Interpreters lighting upon them, did (as I
had desired them, if ever they had Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity)
invite them to Dinner to my House.
One was a tall Man, carrying an ingenious
Simplicity in his Countenance, so that he
seemed either a <hi>Flemming</hi> or a <hi>Batavian:</hi> The
other was shorter of a well-set Body, and
browner colour, a <hi>Greek</hi> by Birth, but by
frequent Commerce with that People, he had
got much of their Language, and seemed to
forget his own: Being asked concerning the
Nature and Manners of that People, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
very pertinently, That they were a
Warlike Nation, that inhabited many Towns
thereabouts, from whence the Cham of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi>
when he pleased, used to draw forth
800 Musketeers, the chief Prop of his Army.
Their chief Cities were two, one called <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eup</hi>
the other <hi>Scivarin.</hi> He added much more
concerning the <hi>Tartars</hi> and their Barbarity,
yet he confessed that there was some very
ingenious Men amongst them: If you asked
of the highest Affairs, they would answer
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:52279:156"/>
briefly yet very oppositely; insomuch that
the <hi>Turks</hi> said ordinarily of them, That
<hi>other Nations had their Learning in their Books,
but the</hi> Tartars <hi>had eaten their Books, and had
their Wisdom in their Breasts, from whence they
could draw it out as they had occasion, as Divine
Oracles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are Slovenly in their Deportment,
for if you set any Soop before them, they
eat it not with a Spoon, but with the hollow
of their Hands. Their Meat is Horse-flesh,
not roasted but heated under the Saddles of
their Horses, to which Hunger was their best
Sauce.</p>
               <p>Their Prince is served in Siver, his first
and last Dish being a Horses Head, as Butter
uses to be served up first and last with us.
He repeated many <hi>German</hi> Words, amongst
others, which were unintelligible to us, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
his Memory fail'd him, so that he mix'd
home-bred and Forreign Words together; to

When he was desired to number, he said thus,

<hi>German-like,</hi> do highly value your selves, and
undervalue us, as if we pronounced <hi>Seven</hi>
more coursly: He went on reckoning <hi>Athe,
nyne, thiine, thiinita, thiinetua, thiinetria,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Twenty</hi> he called <hi>Stega,</hi> Thirty <hi>Treithyen,</hi> Forty
<hi>Furdeithien,</hi> an Hundren <hi>Sada,</hi> a Thousand
<hi>Hazer.</hi> He also sung us a Song in that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
which began thus:

               </p>
               <p>Whether these People be <hi>Goths</hi> or <hi>Saxons,</hi>
I cannot tell; If <hi>Saxons,</hi> then, I suppose,
they were transplanted thither in the time of
<hi>Charles</hi> the Great, who dispersed that Nation
into many remote Countries, as appears by
the Cities of <hi>Transilvania,</hi> which to this day
are inhabited by <hi>Saxons;</hi> and possibly he
might transplant the rest of the Nation as
far as <hi>Taurick Chersoness,</hi> where they still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Christian Religion, though surrounded
with the Enemies thereof: But if they are
<hi>Goths,</hi> then I judge they chose their Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
there next to the <hi>Getis,</hi> and perhaps
most of that Tract of Land between the
<hi>Gothick</hi> Isle and <hi>Procopia,</hi> (as now 'tis called)
was heretofore inhabited by <hi>Goths.</hi> Hence

over-run the World with their Victory, and
were the great Seminary of Multitudes of
Barbarians. This is all I could hear of these
<hi>Procopensians</hi> concerning the <hi>Taurick Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonese.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let me now tell you something of the City
and Country <hi>Cathay,</hi> which I learned of
a certain <hi>Turkish</hi> Pilgrim, who use to Travel
over the World on account of Religion, and
to worship God on high Mountains and desert
places. He had travelled over a great part
of the East-Country, where he was acquainted
with the <hi>Portuguese;</hi> but having a desire to
visit <hi>Cathay</hi> also, he joyned himself to some
Merchants, who in great Numbers used to
Travel to this Country: 'Tis a Journy that
not many will undertake, it being so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
and the way thither so full of strange
Nations, who use to plunder Travellers in
their passage: When he left <hi>Persia</hi> behind
him, he came to <hi>Samarehand,</hi> to <hi>Borchar,</hi> and
to <hi>Taschan,</hi> and other Towns inhabited by
the Successors of <hi>Tamerlain:</hi> When he had
passed by these places there were mighty
Deserts, and some Countries inhabited by
Wild, and others by a more civilized, People;
yet the Country was generally Poor, so that
they were forced to carry their Victuals along
with them on a Drove of Camels: This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
they call <hi>Caravans.</hi> After some Months
travel they came to the <hi>Streights,</hi> entring into
<hi>Cathay,</hi> (for you must know, that a great part
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:52279:158"/>
of that Country is <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> and encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
by such huge Mountains and Rocks,
that it is accessible but in a very few Passages,
where their King hath his Guards and <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons:</hi>)
When the Merchants come thither,
they are asked What they bring? Whence
they come? and How many they are? When
the Guard is informed of the Truth, they
make a Smoak by day, or else kindle a Beacon
by night, which gives warning to the next
Beacon, and so from one to another till they
come to <hi>Cathay.</hi> This Advice cost them but
some Hours, which otherwise would take up
many Days, the way is so long: When
News is brought to the King, he sends back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
by the same way of Conveyance what
his Pleasure is, whether they shall <hi>all</hi> be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to enter, or only <hi>some,</hi> the rest being
either excluded, or made to stay longer:
When they are admitted, they are guarded
all along to their several Inns or Lodging-places,
where they may have all things for
their Mony, till they come to the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Here every one brings forth his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
Ware, and presents the King, whose
Privilege it is, to buy what Ware he pleaseth
in the first place; and then they sell the rest
to the best Chapman. This they must do
within certain limits of time, within which
they must return; for the <hi>Catharians</hi> cannot
endure that Strangers should live long amongst
them, for fear they should infect their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
Manners. Thus is the <hi>Caravan</hi> dismissed
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:52279:159"/>
very friendly, and returns by the same Stages
they went.</p>
               <p>This Traveller told me, That they were
a very Wise People, and lived in good Order
and Government, having a distinct Religion
of their own, differing from the <hi>Christian,
Iewish</hi> or <hi>Mahometans,</hi> but nearest to the
<hi>Iewish,</hi> except their Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>Printing hath been in use among them for
many Ages, as appears by their several Printed
Books: For Paper they use the Cases of <hi>Silk-worms,</hi>
it is so thin that it will bear Printing
on one side only, the other is blank: In this
City, he said, there were a great many Shops
full of Musk, which was the fresh Foame of
a certain Beast as big as a Kid. A Lyon is
highly prized amongst them, there are none
of them in that Country, and therefore they
value it at a great Rate, and they will give
most for it. This is what I could learn of
this Wanderer concerning <hi>Cathay,</hi> believe it
as you please: I asked him farther, Whether
he had brought back any rare Root, Fruit
or Stone, out of that Country: He told me,
he had brought nothing but a little Root for
his own use, which he would bite and eat
a little of when he was Faint or Cold, and
it would presently heat and relieve him; and
thereupon he parted it, and gave some to me,
telling me I must use it very sparingly: I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
Dr. <hi>Williams,</hi> my Physician, then alive, to
tast of it, who by its biting and inflaming tast,
judged it to be a Tree <hi>Wolf-leaf.</hi>

Let me now tell you another wondrous
<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tory of a certain Wandering <hi>Turkish</hi> Monk,
<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e wore a Cap and White Cloak down to his
Heels, with long Hair, such as Painters draw
the <hi>Apostles</hi> with: He had a promising Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
but was a meer Impostor, yet the
<hi>Turks</hi> admired him as a Miraculous Man; my
Interpreters were perswaded to bring him to
me, that I might see him; he dined with me
soberly and modestly enough; afterwards he
goes down into the Yard, and upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
he takes up a huge Stone, and struck it
divers times on his naked Breast, as many
blows as would have felled an Oxe: Then
he took a piece of Iron, that was heated in
the Fire on purpose, and thrust it into his
Mouth, where he stirred it up and down so
that his Spittle hiss'd again; 'twas a long
piece of Iron, thick and quadrangular in that
part which he thrust into his Mouth, and it
was red-hot as a live Coal: Then he put the
Iron into the Fire again, and after I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
a Largess on him, he saluted me and
departed. My Domesticks wondred at the
Prank, all but one, which pretended he knew
more than all the rest; <hi>O,</hi> says he, <hi>he is but
a meer Cheat;</hi> and thereupon he takes hold
of the stronger part of the Iron, pretending
he could do as much as the Juggler; but he
had no sooner grasped it in his hands, but he
threw it away, and his Fingers were well
burnt for his Audaciousness, so that they
were many days a curing. This Accident
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:52279:160"/>
caused his Fellows to Laugh, and jearingly
to ask, Whether the Iron were hot enough
yet, and whether he would touch it again
or not?</p>
               <p>The same <hi>Turk,</hi> while he was at Dinner,
told me, That the Prior of their Monastery
was a Man Famous for Sanctimony and Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
for he would spread his Cloak over a
Lake near adjoyning, and sitting on it, would
row up and down whither he pleased: And
that he would strip himself naked, and be
tied to a Sheep newly kill'd, tying Arms to
Arms, and Leg to Leg, and so would be
thrown into the hot Oven till the Sheep were
bak'd fit to be eaten, then he himself would
be taken out without any harm at all: You
will not believe it, neither do I, only I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
what he told me; but that part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
an hot Iron I saw with my Eyes.</p>
               <p>And yet I must tell you, the matter is not
so much to be admired, for without doubt,
the Fellow, when he went down into the
Yard to fetch a Stone, had fortified his
Mouth with some Medicines against the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the Fire, such Medicines being suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
as you know; for I remember once at
the Coast of <hi>Venice,</hi> I saw a Juggler melt Lead
in the Fire, and wash his Hands therewith,
as if it had been common Water: But enough
of this.</p>
               <p>I told you before, that I had a little more
Freedom some time before <hi>Rustan</hi>'s Death,
which was grateful Love on one account,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:52279:160"/>
because it gave me Opportunity to converse
with Strangers and others which frequented
my House, whose Acquaintance might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to me; and yet this Liberty was not
ballanced without Inconvenience, it gave my
Servants opportunity to Straggle abroad, and
sometimes without the <hi>Iannizaries,</hi> and so
they met with many Affront, which cost me
some trouble: I'll tell you of one, by which
you may judge of the rest.</p>
               <p>Two of my Servants passed over in a Boat
to <hi>Pera,</hi> they went alone, either because the
<hi>Iannizaries</hi> were not at home, or else they
thought it needless to take them; one was
my Apothecary, the other Master of my
Wine-Cellar; when they had done what they
went for, they hired a Boat to carry them
back to <hi>Constantinople;</hi> they were scarce set
down in the Boat, but there came a Youth
from the <hi>Caddy</hi> or Judge of that Place, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
them to come forth, for the <hi>Caddy</hi>
must be wasted over in that Boat: My Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
told him, There were Boats enough to
carry over the <hi>Caddy,</hi> besides that which they
had hired, and therefore they would not
come forth: Hereupon he endeavoured to
force them; so that from Words they came
to Blows. This being done in the sight of
the <hi>Caddy,</hi> who was coming down to the Boat,
it made him run to help his Boy, (who was
thought to be his <hi>Ganymede</hi>) but the Steps
towards the Sea being slippery, by reason of
Ice, (for it was Winter) he fell head-long
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:52279:161"/>
into the Sea, and had been drown'd if his
Companions had not relieved him: Here upon
a Clamour was raised all over <hi>Pera,</hi> and the
Vogue went among the <hi>Turks,</hi> that my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
had laid Violent Hands on the Judge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
and had almost drown'd him: My Servants
were seized and carried before the Judge of
Capital Case: They fetch forth Clubs, and
Stocks to put their Feet in, that they might
beat them, as their manner is, on the Soles of
them: In the interim, one of my Servants, an
<hi>Italian,</hi> in a petting Chuff, cried out, <hi>Beat,
strike, Dogs, strike; we are wronged, we are
Innocent, we are Servants to</hi> Cesar<hi>'s Embassador,
and doubtless when your own Emperor shall know
how we are abused, he will make you smart for it.</hi>
One of the <hi>Turks,</hi> hearing him cry out so
boldly: <hi>D'ye think,</hi> said he, <hi>that one-ey'd thing
is a Man? No, for certain he is an One-ey'd</hi>
Cacodaemon, (for he had a Blemish in one
of his Eyes.) The <hi>Waywade</hi> also, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) the
Judge in their Language, perceiving the Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Man, was in a stand what to do,
but thought it best to send them to <hi>Rustan</hi> for
to punish them: Thither went the whole
Rout, with a pack of False-Witnesses, ready
to give false Testimonies against the Innocent;
for the <hi>Turks</hi> count it Meritorious to give in
Evidence against a <hi>Christian;</hi> you need not
Summon them to appear, they came of their
own accords, as it hapned in this Case: They
all cried out before the <hi>Grand Visier,</hi> That
those Rogues had beaten their Judge, and if
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:52279:161"/>
they had not been seized, would have drown'd
him: My Servants denied the Crime objected,
alledging that they were falsly accused, and
that they were my menial Servants. By this
time <hi>Rustan</hi> understood, that there was more
Noise than Right on his Country-mens side;
yet to still the Fury of the inraged Multitude,
he told them, He would punish them severely,
and sent them to Prison. The Prison was a
Safe-guard to them against the Fury of the
Multititude; then the examined Witnesses,
the most Credible amongst them, and found
that my Servants were Guiltless, all the Fault
lay at the <hi>Caddy</hi>'s door. In the mean time
I sent my Interpreters to demand my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
but <hi>Rustan</hi> thought fit to refer the
Matter to the <hi>Divan,</hi> lest, if the <hi>Sultan</hi> should
hear of it, he might suspect, that in the
<hi>Caddy</hi>'s Case he had been brib'd, and so his
Injury neglected. I had at this time some
intimate Acquaintance with <hi>Haly,</hi> to whom
I sent my <hi>Druggerman</hi> with a grievous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
that I might not suffer Wrong to
the end of the Chapter; <hi>Haly</hi> undertook my
Cause, and bid me rest confident that my
Business would soon end to my Satisfaction.
But <hi>Rustan</hi> came not off so handsomly, he
fear'd that it might be thought that Mony
had made him more execrable, and therefore
he had rather the Business had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
with the <hi>Caddy,</hi> and wish'd me to
offer him a few Ducats to appease him, 25
were enough. I gave him Thanks for his
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:52279:162"/>
Advice, but returned answer, That if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
me to throw so many Ducats into the
Sea, I would willingly do it for his sake, but
'twas not Mony in this case would do, but
Example: <hi>For,</hi> said I, <hi>if this be the Case, that
he that did my Servants an Injury, must be paid
for his Labour, a larger Fund than mine would
not suffice; for if a Man tear his Clothes, if
he intended to do my People an Injury, he knew
where to have Mony to buy new ones, which was
an unworthy thing, and by no means to be indured
by me.</hi> Thus were my Servants, by the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
of <hi>Haly,</hi> sent home to me. When the
<hi>Bailo</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> heard of their release, he sent
for one of my Servants present, and desired
to know of him, what that Business had cost
me? <hi>Not a Doit,</hi> said he. Then said the <hi>Bailo,
If it had been mine, it would have cost me</hi> 200
<hi>Ducats before I could have come off.</hi> But the
sorry Judge suffered most of all; for he was
put out of his Office, the <hi>Turks</hi> accounting
it an absurd an hainous thing to be beaten
by a <hi>Christian,</hi> as he confessed he had been.</p>
               <p>As for the Release of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
it was obtained by my Mediation,
they were these, <hi>Sandaeus</hi> Commander of the
Land-Forces, and <hi>Leva,</hi> and <hi>Requisenaeus,</hi> the
one Admiral of the <hi>Neapolitan,</hi> the other the
<hi>Silician</hi> Gallies. In short, I'll tell you how
I compassed their release: The Peace made
between the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> did
much trouble the <hi>Turks,</hi> as being Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
for their Affairs, especially considering
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:52279:162"/>
that they were not comprehended in it, as at
first they thought they should, yet they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
the matter at present, but sought
for an Opportunity to shew their dislike
thereof. <hi>Solyman</hi> had writ to the King of
<hi>France,</hi> that he agreed to the Peace, yet
would have him remember, <hi>That old Friends
are not easily made Enemies,</hi> nor <hi>Old Enemies
Friends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Disgust of the <hi>Turks</hi> did much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
my Affairs: To which <hi>Haly</hi> Bassa's
Kindness did contribute very much, and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahim</hi>'s
great desire to serve me, and to be
thankful to me.</p>
               <p>You may remember I told you before,
that when <hi>La Vigne</hi> did accuse me to the
<hi>Bassa,</hi> at the same time he forgot not <hi>Ebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,</hi>
b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t told them, that he discovered all the
secret Counsels of the <hi>Turks</hi> to me. This <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahim</hi>
was the chief <hi>Drogerman, (i. e.)</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter
of <hi>Solyman,</hi> a <hi>Polander</hi> by Nation, and
therefore more hated by <hi>La Vigne,</hi> because in
a deadly Fewd that was between <hi>Codognatus</hi>
a former Ambassador of the same King; and
in jest he seem'd to take <hi>Codognatus</hi> his part.
I shall not trouble you with the Contest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, it being alien to my purpose:
This is certain, that <hi>La Vigne</hi> was mindful of
the Affront, and could never endure <hi>Ebrahim,</hi>
but when he had Access to the <hi>Bassa</hi> every
third Ward was against him; neither did he
desist from complaining till <hi>Ebrahim</hi> was
thrown out of his Place: For my part, I was
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:52279:163"/>
not much concern'd for <hi>Ebrahim</hi>'s Disgrace;
I had never such an extraordinary kindness for
him, so as to lament his Loss, for I found him
many times cross to my Affairs; only it
troubled me, that 'twas noised abroad, he
lost his Place for my sake. Hereupon I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
him in his Privacy what I could; for I
knew it troubled him, to be thrown out of
Office, and therefore I us'd him as an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter
or Messenger, betwixt me and the
<hi>Bassa</hi> in the Transacting about the Peace.
And <hi>Haly</hi> admitted him out of Respect to
me, because he was Degraded without any
just Cause. <hi>In fine,</hi> I never left till I got him
settled into his Place again; which Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie
did so oblige him, that in Gratitude
he shew'd me all the good Offices he could, in
all Company and on all Occasions: And he
had the greater Opportunity so to do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the Offence the <hi>Turks</hi> had taken of
the <hi>French,</hi> for the making Peace with the
<hi>Spaniard.</hi> On which account, when the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Salvatus</hi> was sent by the most <hi>Christian
King,</hi> to procure the Liberty of <hi>Sandaeus,</hi> he
was wholly and absolutely refus'd. <hi>Sandaeus</hi>
was in mighty expectation of that Embassie,
believing he should never be released, if that
Negotiation had not effected it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was at great Expence to buy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
for the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> and other great
Men upon his Release. All which signified
nothing, for <hi>Salvatus</hi> went away without
effecting any thing: When he was gone, the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:52279:163"/>
Servants and Solicitor of <hi>Sandaeus</hi> came to
me in a great Fright; and told me, they
durst not acquaint their Master with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>successful
News of <hi>Salvatus</hi>'s Intercession for
his Liberty; for all his Hopes depending
thereon, they were afraid the Transaction
would either make him desperate, or cast
him into some fatal Disease; and therefore
they desired me to acquaint him first by Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
I refused, alledging, That I had not
<hi>common Places</hi> enough to draw Comfort from,
for a Man in so deep a Distress. For <hi>Sandaeus</hi>
was a Man of a great Spirit, full of Hope,
and without any Fear; and Men of such
Dispositions, as they hope for what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
so if they are disappointed of their
Hopes, they are so cast down, that 'tis hard
to raise them to any tolerable frame of
Spirit.</p>
               <p>Whilst Matters stood thus at a stand, in
comes <hi>Ebrahim</hi> my Interpreter, very oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely;
and falling into discourse about
these <hi>Spanish Prisoners;</hi> he told me plainly,
That if I did but demand their Liberty, I
should certainly obtain it; and what he
spake was upon good grounds. He had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
given me some blind Hopes, that I
might procure their Release if I set my self
about it; but I gave but little heed to his
Suggestion: For not being certain to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
Peace, how could I attempt such a
Thing. Besides I was afraid, lest my Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
might hinder the Success of <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>'s
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:52279:164"/>
Negotiation: But he was gone, and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahim</hi>
whom I had so much obliged, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
in the same Opinion. I began to
hearken to him; yet telling him, he should
have a care he did not engage me who was
his Friend, in a ridiculous Business; or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt I should be laught at if I succeeded
not therein, the Matter being thought diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to be compassed in common Opinion, and
<hi>Salviatus</hi> having attempted it in vain; yet he
advised me to proceed therein, and amused
me with good Success.</p>
               <p>Upon this Encouragement, I wrote to <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeus,</hi>
how fruitless <hi>Salviatus</hi>'s Embassie had
been, yet I wisht him not to despair; for if
any Credit at all were to be given to a <hi>Turk,</hi>
there was good hope of his Affairs; and then
I related what <hi>Ebrahim</hi> had told me.</p>
               <p>Having laid this Foundation, I advis'd
with some Friends who were well skill'd in
<hi>Turkish Affairs;</hi> they wisht me all good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
but were very doubtful of them, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
seeing the King of <hi>Frances</hi>'s Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
had been denyed, and the issue of Peace
was yet undetermined; and moreover, the
<hi>Turks</hi> are hardly ever induced to release great
Men; yet I wrote to my Master the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
to let him know what Hopes I had, and
desired that I might in his Name beg the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease
of those Prisoners. To be short, upon
great Gifts and more Promises made to the
<hi>Bussa's,</hi> for their Favour in the Case; the Day
before St. <hi>Laurence</hi>'s Day, all the Prisoners
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:52279:164"/>
were released and sent to my Lodgings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sandaeus</hi> and <hi>Leyva</hi> were at great odds one
with another, so that they would not eat
together, but I was forced to spread their
Tables apart; <hi>Requisena</hi> did eat with <hi>Leyva,</hi>
and <hi>Sandaeus</hi> with me: So we went to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
The <hi>French Ambassador's</hi> Steward came
to me, bringing me some Letters; <hi>Sandaeus</hi>
askt of him, If he knew him? Yes Sir, said he,
I think you are <hi>Don Alvarez:</hi> I am so, said he;
Pray remember me to your Master, and tell
him, that I have obtain'd my Liberty by
means of the Emperor's Ambassador, and
that you have seen me abroad with your
Eyes: I see you indeed, Sir, said he, but so,
that I can scarce believe my own Eyes. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeus</hi>
did thus Accost him, because his Master
the <hi>French Agent,</hi> would never believe that
<hi>Solyman</hi> would release those great Men at the
Emperor's instance: And the truth is, before
they could obtain their Liberty, their <hi>Mufty</hi>
which is as an <hi>Archbishop</hi> amongst the <hi>Turks,</hi>
was consulted, Whether a great many <hi>Turks</hi>
might not be released for a few <hi>Christians;</hi>
for I had promis'd, that about Forty <hi>Turks</hi>
of an ordinary Rank, who were Prisoners
with us, should be released for them. The
<hi>Mufty</hi> answered, That there were two Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
on the Case; one <hi>Pro,</hi> t'other <hi>Con;</hi>
but he was for the Affirmative.</p>
               <p>It now remains that I acquaint you with
the last End of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> who I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
was put in Prison by the <hi>Persians:</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:52279:165"/>
Messages had passed between those two
Princes on that Occasion; and an Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
came once from <hi>Persia</hi> with Presents, a
Tent curiously wrought, <hi>Assyrian</hi> and <hi>Persian</hi>
Tapistry, with the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and some Beasts
of an unusual sort; as an <hi>Indian</hi> Ant, as big
as any ordinary Dog; a fierce and biting
Present. The Cause of the Embassie was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be, the Reconciliation of <hi>Bajazet</hi>
with his Father; they were received very
Honourably, entertain'd with rich Banquets,
of which <hi>Haly</hi> sent me a part, eight huge mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
Dishes full of Sweetmeats. 'Twas the
Custom of the <hi>Romans</hi> to send Dishes from
their Feasts to their Friends; the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
do it to this Day; and the <hi>Turks</hi> from their
great Feasts carry home something, especially
if they have Wives and Children; they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times carried home whole Napkins full of
good eatable Bits from my Table; and tho'
they pretend to Cleanliness, yet they would
sometimes daub their Silk-cloaths with some
Collation-drops.</p>
               <p>Let me tell you a Story to this purpose,
which I know will make you laugh heartily,
as it did me at first hearing thereof: For we
are not such <hi>Cato's,</hi> but yet sometimes we
may season our Care with moderate Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which shews that we are <hi>Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis the Custom of the <hi>Turkish Bassa's,</hi> some
Days before their Fast, (which we call <hi>Lent)</hi>
to make a publick Feast or Entertainment
for all Comers, none are excluded; yet
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:52279:165"/>
generally none but Servants, Friends, and
Relations come: There is a Napkin made
of Leather spread over a long Tapistry on
the Ground, full of Dishes; the Table will
hold abundance of Guests; the <hi>Bassa</hi> himself
sits at the upper end, and the choicest Guests
next to him, and then the ordinary Guests
in Ranks till the Table be full. It will not
hold all at once, but some stand by till others
have Din'd, which they do in great Modesty
and Silence; and then they drinking a
draught of Honey diluted with Water, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
their Landlord, and away they go;
when they are gone, others sit down in their
places, and a third Class after them; the
Servants still taking off the old Dishes and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>etting on new. A certain <hi>Bassa</hi> making
such a Feast, invited a <hi>Singiack</hi> to sit next to
him; an old Man of the Sect which the <hi>Turks</hi>
call <hi>Hayges, (i. e.)</hi> Learned Men, sat next to
him: This <hi>Haggie</hi> seeing such a plenty of
Victuals before him, had a mind to carry
home some to his Wife after he had filled
his own Belly; but looking for his Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief
to fill it with Victuals, he found he
had left it at home; being then in a straight,
he bethought himself, and resolv'd to fill his
Sleeve that hang'd on on his Back; but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staking
the <hi>Singiack</hi>'s for his own, he stuft
it full of Dainties, and stops it in with a piece
of Bread that nothing might fall out; he was
not to touch his Sleeve till he had laid his
Hands on his Breast or Thigh, and so Saluted
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:52279:166"/>
his Entertainer as their Custom is; when he
had done that, he took up his own Sleeve and
finds it empty, at which he was much amaz'd,
and return'd home very sad: A while after
the <hi>Singiack</hi> also rose from the Table, and
having Saluted the <hi>Bassa,</hi> at every step his
Sleeve cast out the Dainties it was replenished
with, unknown to him; and seeing a Train
of Junkets behind him, he blusht for shame:
The Company fell a laughing, but the <hi>Bassa</hi>
imagining how it came to pass, desired him
to sit down again, and so he sent for the
<hi>Haggai;</hi> when he came, he accosted him thus:
<hi>I wonder that you being an old Friend, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a Wife and Children at home, did carry
home nothing to them, seeing my Table was so
well Furnished.</hi> Truly, Sir, said he, <hi>'Twas no
Fault of mine, but I think my</hi> Genius <hi>was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
with me; for I stuft my Sleeve with Viands,
and yet when I came forth I found it empty.</hi>
Thus the <hi>Singiack</hi> was cheated, and the
Frustration of the <hi>Haggai,</hi> together with the
Novelty of the Case, occasioned no small
Laughter amongst all the Company. But to
return to <hi>Bajazet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Case was desperate, between an <hi>angry
Father</hi> that required to have him given up,
and a <hi>false Friend,</hi> who pretended to detain
him: Sometimes <hi>Solyman</hi> dealt mildly with
the <hi>Persian,</hi> putting him in mind of the
League between them, that they were to have
the same Enemies and Friends: Sometimes
he taxed him with War, if <hi>Bajazet</hi> was not
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:52279:166"/>
surrendred; and thereupon he placed strong
Garrisons on all the Confines of <hi>Persia,</hi> he
filled <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> and the Banks of <hi>Euphrates</hi>
with Soldiers, especially the Veteran ones,
whom he had employed against <hi>Bajazet,</hi> over
whom <hi>Mahomet</hi> the third of the Viziers <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa's,</hi>
and <hi>Beglerbey</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> was made Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
for <hi>Solyman</hi> was returned home: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
he sollicited the <hi>Georgians</hi> dwelling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Hircan</hi>-Sea and <hi>Pontus,</hi> bordering
on <hi>Persia</hi> to Aid him against them: They
answered couragiously, That they were not
strong enough themselves to Cope with the
<hi>Persian;</hi> but if he himself came upon the
Place with an Army, they would then shew
themselves Men of Courage against the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi>
as their common Enemy. The <hi>Hirca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
also and the Posterity of <hi>Tamerlan</hi> were
sollicitous to joyn Arms: <hi>Solyman</hi> himself
gave forth, that he would go to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> (a
City of <hi>Syria,</hi> seated on the Banks of <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes)</hi>
that from thence he might make War
on the <hi>Persian:</hi> Nor was the <hi>Persian</hi> himself
without Fear, for he had often experienced
the Dint of <hi>Solyman</hi>'s Sword. But the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the <hi>Turks</hi> were averse from the War,
and lookt on it as a wicked and detestable one,
and this cooled the <hi>Sultan.</hi> A great many
Soldiers, especially Horse, forsook their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
and return'd to <hi>Constantinople</hi> without
leave of Officers; and being commanded im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to return, they did so; but so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:52279:167"/>
that <hi>Solyman</hi> plainly saw their Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
from the Service.</p>
               <p>Whereupon <hi>Solyman,</hi> seeing he could
not get <hi>Bajazet</hi> alive out of the <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s
Hands, (who feared his Revenge if
ever he came off clear,) descended to the
next thing, which was, to have him strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
there, and he hop'd to obtain his end
this way; because the <hi>Persian</hi> had lately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
him by Letter, that he had been
very remiss in so great an Affair. I have
sent divers Ambassadors to you, said he, but
you send nothing to me but empty Letters,
or Messengers; and therefore to convince me
that you are real in the Business: Send some
considerable Ambassadors of your prime Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
with whom I may Transact, according
to the greatness of the Affair. As for himself,
<hi>Bajazet</hi> had been a great Charge to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he could be taken, and therefore 'twas
fit an Account should be had of those Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
<hi>Solyman</hi> thereby saw that Money was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd,
and therefore by the Advice of his
<hi>Bassa,</hi> he resolved to take any other course,
rather than to involve himself in an unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
War with the <hi>Persians.</hi> Hereupon
<hi>Hassan Aga,</hi> together with an old <hi>Bassa,</hi> one
of the Bed-Chamber, was sent by <hi>Solyman</hi>
into <hi>Persia:</hi> They departed with ample
Commission in the midst of the Winter; they
made great haste, insomuch that they lost se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of their Retinue in the way: At last
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:52279:167"/>
they came to <hi>Casbia</hi> to the <hi>Sophi,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to see <hi>Bajazet;</hi> they found him in a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>asty filthy Prison, his Beard and Hair so
long, that till he was shav'd he could hardly
be known; but then <hi>Hanan</hi> knew him by
the lineaments of his Face, having been
brought up with him from a Child, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was chosen as the fittest Person for
this Embassie. They agreed that the <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
should be repaid what he had laid out,
and should have many rich Presents besides,
provided they would destroy <hi>Bajazet;</hi> The
<hi>Hassan</hi> returns &amp; gives an account to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
who thereupon sent the Expence by him,
with the Gifts, who were guarded by the <hi>Turks</hi>
to the Confines of <hi>Persia.</hi> Thus <hi>Hassan</hi> again
returned to be the Executioner of <hi>Bajazet</hi>
with his own Hand, for so <hi>Solyman</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded:
When the Bow-string was about
his Neck, he desired but one thing before his
Death, which was, to see his Children, and
to take his last leave of them by a Final Kiss,
but that was deny'd. This was the end of
<hi>Bajazet</hi> and his unfortunate Designs; the
way he took to save himself was his Ruine;
his four Children under-went the same Fate;
the new-born Infant which he left at <hi>Amusia,</hi>
whom his Grandfather had removed to <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi>
to be Educated there, when his Father was
dead, a trusty <hi>Eunuch</hi> was sent to <hi>Persia</hi> to
destroy him too; but the <hi>Eunuch</hi> being ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hearted,
procured a certain Porter, a
hard-hearted Fellow, who car'd not what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:52279:168"/>
Pranks he play'd, to joyn with him
to help dispatch the Child. This Fellow
went into the Room, and as he was fitting
the String to the Infant's Neck, the poor
Child lifted up its self as well as he could,
and embracing him in his Arms, offered to
kiss him, which did so mollifie his wretched
Heart, that he fell down in a Swoon. The
<hi>Eunuch</hi> stood at the Door, and wondering at
the Delay, went in and found the Fellow
sprawling on the Ground, whereupon he was
forced to execute the Charge himself, and so
strangled the poor Child. By this Passage it
appears, that <hi>Solyman</hi> spar'd his Nephew hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto,
not out of any Principle of Mercy, but
out of an Opinion the <hi>Turks</hi> have, that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
if they succeed well, are pleasing to God;
and therefore as long as 'twas uncertain what
the Aim of <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s Designs would be, he
would not imbrue his Hands in his Childs
Blood, lest if <hi>Bajazet</hi> had succeeded, he might
seem to have resisted the Will of God: But
when <hi>Bajazet</hi> was slain, then he thought God
had determined the Controversie, and that
his Son also might not be spared, lest the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb
should be verified, <hi>Of an ill Crow, an evil
Egg.</hi> I had a long Discourse with my <hi>Chiaux</hi>
upon this Subject when I was in the Island (as
above-said) and had liberty to Sail from
one to the other. It hapned once, that as
we were returning in our Skiff, the Wind
being against us, we could not double a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montary
that reach'd pretty far into the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:52279:168"/>
Sea, that we were forced to Land and take
our Dinner a-shoar; for I always carried
some Provant along with me in the Vessel for
fear of the worst; and their <hi>Turks</hi> were also
forced to Land upon the same Stress of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
Our Table was spread in a great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
my <hi>Chiaux</hi> and my Interpreter sate at
Table with me; mention being occasionally
made of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> the <hi>Chiaux</hi> began to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh
bitterly against him for taking up
Arms against his Brother. I pleaded for him,
and said, he was worthy of Pity, who was
forced to do what he did: There was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable
necessity upon him, either to submit
himself to a certain Death, or to save his
Life by taking Arms. However the <hi>Chiaux</hi>
persisted still to execrate his Undertaking,
whereupon I pleaded thus; You accuse <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet</hi>
as Guilty of an horrid Offence, but you
acquit <hi>Solyman</hi> the Father of your present Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
who took up Arms against his Father.
We do so, said the <hi>Chiaux,</hi> and we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for it, for the Event shew'd, that what he
did was by God's Approbation, and was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinated
in Heaven. If you argue from Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
said I, then the wickedest Fact, if
it prosper, may be reputed to God as the
Author, and then he may be made the Author
of Sin, if <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> must be interpreted
only by Events. We dwelt awhile on this
Discourse, and were very eager upon it,
whilst either of us defended his own Opinion;
we alledg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d many Places of Scripture; <hi>Can
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:52279:169"/>
the Vessel say to the Potter, Why hast thou made
me thus? I will harden</hi> Pharaoh<hi>'s Heart.</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob
<hi>have I loved,</hi> Esau <hi>have I hated:</hi> and
others of like Import.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> that were not far from us, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd
at what we Contested so earnestly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout;
and after we rose from the Table, my
<hi>Chiaux</hi> went to them; they gathered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in a Ring about him, and I saw them
hearkning to the Discourse he made, with
great Attention; and at last, at Noon, they
were all silent, and Worshipped God accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Custom. I thought long till my
<hi>Chiaux</hi> returned to me again, that I might
know why he prated so amongst his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades;
I was afraid, tho' he was a fair Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition'd
man, yet that he might Represent
what I had spoken to him, to my prejudice:
At last when the Wind ceased, we went A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board
again and followed our Course. The
first thing that I did, was to ask of my
<hi>Chiaux,</hi> What serious Discourse he held with
his Country-men? He smil'd, and made me
this Answer: <hi>We were disputing about</hi> Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination,
<hi>and I told them what you had alledg'd</hi>
Con <hi>and</hi> Pro; <hi>bywhich it was plain, that you had
read our Books, and was well read in the</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<hi>so that there was nothing wanting to your
Happiness, but to turn to our</hi> Religion, <hi>which
in the Prayers you saw us make, we desired of God.</hi>
When News was brought to <hi>Constantinople</hi>
that <hi>Bajazet</hi> was dispatched, I was afraid
that our Affairs, which were in an hopeful
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:52279:169"/>
way of Conclusion, would now meet with a
Rub at last; the Misfortune of <hi>Bajazet</hi> might
overturn all, make the <hi>Turks</hi> more Insolent,
to undo what was done, and to propose har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Conditions. I had passed over some Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties;
as the Loss of <hi>Gerba,</hi> and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment
of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> and the <hi>Vaivoods</hi> expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
out of <hi>Moldavia;</hi> but there were two ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
ones, at <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s Death, and he hired an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
that I'll speak of by and by.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Haly</hi> sent one of his Domesticks to me, to
tell me that <hi>Bajazet</hi> was dead for certain,
that therefore I should not defer the Peace, in
hopes of his Success: I should remember,
that Princes of the same Religion are more
easily Reconcil'd than those of contrary ones
are; and therefore I should use no more Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giversation,
nor seek Knots in a Bulrush, as the
Proverb is.</p>
               <p>This Message troubled me much, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I thought that the Relater might be
partial, I sent up and down the Town a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
my Friends, to know what certainty
they had of <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s Death; They all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
me answer: <hi>That he was most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
dispatch'd.</hi> Whereupon I resolved to
pluck in my Sails; there was no hopes for me
to obtain better Conditions; it was well if I
could maintain my Ground, and stick to my
former without any change: The Emperor
of the <hi>Turks</hi> had seen them, and was not
much averse from them; some small Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were made; something I wished I
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:52279:170"/>
could have added, other Things were du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biously
expressed, which a malign Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
might raise Scruples about. I did my
endeavour that these might be taken out, or
rendred and made more favourable on our
side. My Master <hi>Caesar</hi> had seen and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
those Conditions, yet still I could not
satisfie my self, till something more favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
was added; whilst I was doing this, I
was accosted with <hi>Haly</hi>'s Message as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said.</p>
               <p>I met also with another grievous Rub;
some Noblemen of <hi>Hungary</hi> had Revolted
from the <hi>Vaivoodans</hi> of <hi>Transilvania</hi> to the
Emperor, (<hi>i. e)</hi> to speak the truth had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to that Duty, and the Garrisons also
which they commanded yielded to <hi>Cesar.</hi> This
new Accident might have disturbed all, for
the <hi>Turks</hi> had a specious pretence to alledge,
That while Conditions of Peace were on
foot once, such Alteration ought to have
been made; if Peace were cordially desired,
all Things were to be return'd to their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine
State: but let Revolters speed as
they pleased, what they had possessed ought
to be return'd to the <hi>Vayvode,</hi> their Client
and Vassal. But <hi>Haly</hi> was so far from pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
this, that one express Condition was,
that those Things should be ratified, which
he willingly assented to. But the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
who came lately from the <hi>Vayvode,</hi>
were very much troubled at it, they rub'd
upon the gall'd place, and filled the whole
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:52279:170"/>
Court with their Clamours, that their mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Master was deserted, the Law of Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
broken, and Enemies preferred before
ancient Friends. All the rest of the <hi>Bassa's</hi>
were moved with their Complaints, only
<hi>Haly</hi> stood firm to me, so that the Articles
of the Peace were not altered at all. For
my part, though I knew that the Terms
would be allowed by my Master <hi>Cesar,</hi> yet
because there want not Sicophants in Prince's
Courts, who go about to obscure the best
Services of their Ministers, especially if Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
I therefore thought it fit to leave all to
the Pleasure of my Master: I told <hi>Haly,</hi> that
though the proposed Condition did not fully
answer the Expectation of my Master, yet I
hoped he would Acquiesce therein, if an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
of theirs were sent along with me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
the Things that were obscure, upon
which any Controversie might arise; and
that <hi>Ebrahim</hi> seem'd to be the fittest Man for
this purpose, by whom <hi>Cesar</hi> might write
back his full Mind concerning the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
this was easily assented to. Thus an
end was put to this long and tedious Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness.</p>
               <p>'Tis a Custom, that when Ambassadors up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
fair Terms depart from <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
the Bassa's do entertain them with a Feast in
the <hi>Divan;</hi> but I was willing to wave that
Badge of esteem, because I would have all left
in suspence, and referr'd to the good Will
and Pleasure of my Master.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:52279:171"/>I had a mind before my departure, to buy
some gallant Horses, and therefore order'd
my Servants to go often to the Markets, to
see if they could find any such. <hi>Haly</hi> being
inform'd thereof, had some of his own brave
Horses to the Fair to be sold; My Servants
had their Eye presently on 'em, and asking
the Price, they told them 120 Duckets, they
offered 80, not knowing whose they were;
which was refused to be taken: A Day or
two after, the same Horse with two more
near as good, were sent me by <hi>Haly</hi> for a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
one was an <hi>Arabian</hi> ambling Nag, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
well shap'd: When I gave him
Thanks for my noble Present, he askt me,
Whether I did not think that Horse which
my Servants offered 80 Duckets for, was not
more worth? Much more, said I, only they
had a Command from me not to exceed that
Price, till perhaps some sudden Defect might
afterwards shew that I had bought Horses too
dear. He advis'd me also how to Manage
their <hi>Turkish</hi> Horses; as that I should give
them but little Meat; that I should make but
short Journeys at first, till they were us'd to
the Roads; and that I should make nine or
ten Days Journey to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> which us'd to
be compassed in five: He gave me also a
choice Vest wrought with Gold, and a Box
full of <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Treacle, the best in the
World; and a Glass full of Balsom, which he
highly prized, Complementing me thus:
<hi>Any other Present,</hi> said he, <hi>are such as Money
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:52279:171"/>
can procure; but this is such a rare Gift, that my
Master cannot send a choicer to the best Friend
or Allies he hath; I got it,</hi> said he, <hi>when I was
Governour of</hi> Egypt, <hi>which Place I held some
Years: there are two sorts of that juicy sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
one which is drawn from the Oil of the
decocted Leaves of the Shrub on which they grow
which yet is black and not much worth; the other
doth distil from the Bark of the Tree when it is
cut, which is yellow and genuine, and mine was
of that sort.</hi> He desired likewise, that I would
send him some Presents, as a Coat of Mail
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itted to his large and full Body, and a strong
Horse that was sure footed; for he was so
big and pursie, that no Horse could be easily
found fit to carry him; and with all kind
of Varnishing matter coming from the <hi>Maple,</hi>
or some other Tree, wherewith our Artists
use to Inlay their Tables. As for <hi>Solyman,</hi> he
gave me no Gifts but common ones, such as
other Ambassadors have had at their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and such as I received from him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
at my Audience of leave; only he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed
against the <hi>Heydukes,</hi> and the Insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Garrison of <hi>Syeth:</hi> To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
is it, <hi>said he,</hi> to make Peace here, if they
continue the War thus. <hi>I told him,</hi> I would
acquaint my Master, and that I did not doubt
but he would afford a Remedy thereto, and
thus by good Fortune about the end of
<hi>August,</hi> I entred upon my desired Journey,
carrying with me a Truce of Eight Years, as
the Fruits of my Eight Years Aboad there,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:52279:172"/>
which may be continued for a longer time,
unless some considerable Change do happen.
When we came to <hi>Sophia</hi> where the Way
parts, one to <hi>Rhagusa,</hi> the other to <hi>Belgrade,
Leyva,</hi> and <hi>Requisena,</hi> desiring of me to part
Company, and to go to <hi>Rhagusa,</hi> that so they
might more easily pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s to <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi>
and procure those Gifts which they promised
to send to the Bassa's, and repay the Money
they had borrowed at <hi>Constantinople;</hi> and
that they would send Letters of Thanks by
me to <hi>Cesar,</hi> to give him due Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for their Release: Which Service they
would willingly have performed in Person,
if their other Occasions had not hindred. I
easily assented to their Requests, and I was
the better pleased, because <hi>Requisena</hi> being
a very old Man died before he came to <hi>Rha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusa:</hi>
If I should have denied their Request,
it might have been thought my Refusal had
contributed to his Disease.</p>
               <p>So that <hi>Sandaeus</hi> and my self passed the rest
of our Journey without any great Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience;
for the truth is, he is a very jest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Man, and if he be troubled with grief,
yet he knows how to cover it, and to pretend
mirth outwardly. In our way many Pleasura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Things offered themselves; sometimes
we would alight and try which of us could
run fastest; I being lean could easily out-run
him who was fat and pursie, as being newly
come out of Prison. As we came near to any
Village, <hi>Ebrahim</hi> would ride up to us, (for
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:52279:172"/>
he with his <hi>Turks</hi> followed greatly on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back)
and beseeched us by all that was dear
to us, not to be seen on foot by the Villages,
for it would be accounted a disgraceful thing
for us amongst the <hi>Turks.</hi> Upon whose Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
sometimes we would go again into our
Chariot, but sometimes we did walk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot
still.</p>
               <p>One of <hi>Sandaeus</hi>'s Facetious sayings, I shall
not pretermit; when we came from <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi>
the Weather was very hot, and so it
continued upon the Way, so that it palled
my Appetite from Food, a very little served
my Turn; but <hi>Sandaeus</hi> being a robust healthy
Person did eat like an Horse, and would ever
and anon tell me that I must follow his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
and eat like a Man of mettle; yet all
his Advice was to no purpose, till about the
beginning of <hi>October</hi> I drew near to the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of <hi>Austria;</hi> and there partly on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Country, and partly of the
Season of the Year, I began to be more
healthy, and to take a larger proportion of
Food.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Sandaeus</hi> observed that I had a
better Stomach than formerly, he began to
vapour over me exceedingly, pretending that
'twas by his Advice and Example that I had
learned to eat my Meat, and that I who was
so many years old had need of him as a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitor
to advice me to take due Sustenance for
my Body; so that if he were obliged to me
for his Release, I was as much beholding to
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:52279:173"/>
him for teaching me to take my necessary
Food. In these Ludicrous Repartees we came
to <hi>Tulna</hi> where we were accosted with some
Trouble. <hi>Sandaeus</hi> u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed to lye in the same
House, if it were capacious enough to hold
us both, if not, then he took his Lodgings at
some Neighbouring House, that he might not
incommode or straighten me: He was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to do so at <hi>Tulna,</hi> and therefore he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that the <hi>Ianizaries</hi> whom I brought with
me from <hi>Constantinople</hi> to <hi>Buda,</hi> to be my
Harbingers on the Way, to find out a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
Lodging for him: One of my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
and a Doctor of Physick, a <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
whom <hi>Sandaeus</hi> had released at <hi>Constantinople</hi>
at his own Charge, went along with the <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizary.</hi>
It happened that they lighted on
the House of another <hi>Ianizary</hi> hard by, who
was appointed as Governor of the Place to
guard Passengers; for the <hi>Turks</hi> use to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
one or two <hi>Ianizaries</hi> in every noted
Town to protect <hi>Christian</hi> Passengers from
Violence; by which Office they get no small
Profit: But this Man had committed some
Offence or other, was put out of his Office,
and therefore was of a very surly &amp; untoward
Humour. My People viewed all his House,
and not finding it for their turn, were going
away; the <hi>Ianizary</hi> first, my Servant next,
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d the Physician last of all. In the <hi>Interim,</hi>
the <hi>Ianizary,</hi> Master of the House, being
walking in his Garden, was told, that some
<hi>Christian</hi> Passengers were seeking for a Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:52279:173"/>
at his House: Whereupon he threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into a Rage, with a Club like <hi>Hercules</hi>
in his Hand, and without speaking a word,
strikes the Physician a great Blow on the
Shoulders as hard as ever he was able; the
Physician to avoid the second Blow, ran out
of the House: My Servant looking back, saw
him lifting up his Club to strike him also, but
he having a thing like an Hatchet in his Hand,
held it cross-ways over his Head, and so kept
off many a lusty Blow, till at last the Handle
of the Hatchet by his often striking began to
break; Then my Servant was enforced to
close in with the <hi>Ianizary,</hi> and was about to
cleave his Skull with his Weapon; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the <hi>Ianizary</hi> fled, and my Servant not
being able to overtake him, threw the Hatchet
after him, which cut him in the Hams, and
fell'd him to the Ground; by which Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
my People escaped: But the Physician
cryed out, that he was a dead Man, and that
all his Bones were broke in pieces. <hi>Sandaeus</hi>
heard his Complaint, and though he were
vext, yet he could not choose but smile, as
thinking that the Doctor was more afraid
than hurt: But that which grievously vexed
and tormented him, was, left on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
he should be carried back to <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople:</hi>
He was of Opinion that the <hi>Bassa's</hi> had
not dealt sincerely in his Case, but had made
only a pretence of Releasement to gratifie
me, but did really seek an occasion to hall
him back again there to Rot in Prison. And
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:52279:174"/>
for the same cause he was much offended with
that Servant of mine who had wounded the
<hi>Ianizary,</hi> especially for saying, <hi>That he was
very sorry that he had not killed him out-right
upon the Spot.</hi> His Words to him were these:
<hi>Honest</hi> Henry, <hi>(for that was my Man's Name)
Prithee be not so Passionate, 'tis no Time nor
Place to shew thy Valour here; we must bear Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
patiently without any just Imputation of
Cowardise; will we, nill we, we are in their Power:
This unseasonable Passion may bring great Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
to us; perhaps it may occasion us to be
brought back to</hi> Constantinople, <hi>and there our
whole Negotiation may be Reversed, or at least
hazarded so to be. Thus new Troubles may arise,
and a new Race of tiresom-labour to be run. I
beseech thee therefore, as for other Reasons, so for
my sake among the rest, restrain thy Passion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> Henry <hi>turned the deaf Ear to all his
Perswasions; for the truth is, he was a self-will'd
inflexible Fellow; and when he was
angry, not capable to hear Reason.</hi> What
care I, <hi>replyed he,</hi> if I had klll'd him. What!
Did he not design to kill me? If but one of his
many Blows had not missed, he had knock'd me
down like an Ox; were I to be blamed if I slew
him, who would have slain me first? I am sorry
withal my Heart, I did not give him his Deaths
Wound: But for the future <hi>(Take my Word
for it)</hi> I'll spare never a <hi>Turk</hi> of them all; but
if he Assaults me, I'll give him as good as he
brings, though it cost me my Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:52279:174"/>
                  <hi>Sandaeus</hi> did not like this surly answer: But
the <hi>Ianizary</hi> who had received the Wound,
aggravated the Matter; upon whose Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
two <hi>Iews</hi> that could speak <hi>Spanish,</hi>
came to me, and told me, that he was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously
hurt, and if he did not give him Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
the matter would not so soon be
passed over, but would create great Trouble
to me. I answered them as I thought fit;
but because I knew the Calumnies and Guise
of the <hi>Turks,</hi> I thought it best speedily to
prevent them; and therefore sent present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one of the Youths to <hi>Ebrahim,</hi> desiring
him to let one of his Servants to be a Guide
to one of mine to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> a sudden E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergency
had necessitated this Journey. <hi>Ebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi>
wondred what the matter was, and came
presently to me to know; I told him I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
a better Convoy from <hi>Hali</hi> Bassa, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
I was out of Hopes ever to reach home,
for two of my Servants were like to be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
and then I told him the whole Story
with the Circumstances thereof: <hi>Ebrahim</hi>
soon perceived how much his own Freehold
was concerned therein, and therefore desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
me to have a little patience till he spoke
with the <hi>Ianizary;</hi> to whom he presently
hyed, and found him in Bed; he chid him
grievously for being so abusive to us, and
told him, that I had made Peace with the
<hi>Port;</hi> and was in great Favour with <hi>Solyman,</hi>
and all the <hi>Bassa's,</hi> that they had denied none
of my Requests, but had granted me several
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:52279:175"/>
Concessions for my own sake, and that he
himself was sent back to Convey me safe into
my own Country, and to take Care that I
might be Honourably Entreated by the way:
That he was the first Man that offered me the
least Affront; and that I was sending back
one to <hi>Constantinople</hi> to Complain thereof;
which, if I did, it may cost him his Head.
This took down my <hi>Ianizary</hi>'s Crest, and
put him into a terrible Fear besides.</p>
               <p>The next Day we continued our Journey
to <hi>Buda;</hi> and the Physician notwithstanding
his great Bruise, was as well able to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
as any of us: When we came in sight of
<hi>Buda,</hi> the Bassa thereof sent some of his
own Family, with several <hi>Chiauxes</hi> to meet
us; and amongst the rest, there was a Troop
of young Men on Horseback, which drew
our Eyes after them in respect of the Novelty
of their Garb; their Heads were uncovered,
and shaven upon their Crowns; there was a
long Line cut with a Knife, and in the Wound
they stuck Feathers of several sorts; and
though Drops of Blood distilled down from
their Wounds, yet they dissembled their
Pain, and rode merrily on as if they Ailed
nothing at all: Just before me there walked
some Footmen, of which, one had his naked
Arms a-keenbow, and both of them had a
Knife, (such as we call <hi>Oragensian</hi>) run
through their Arms above their Elbow; the
one was naked all the upper-parts to his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,
the Skin of his Loyns being so cut in two
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:52279:175"/>
places both above and below, that a Club
being run through them, hung down from
thence as from a Girdle; another had a
Horseshoe nailed to the Crown of his Head,
and it was so old, that the Shoe and the
Skin grew together.</p>
               <p>In this Posture we entred <hi>Buda,</hi> and were
Introduced to the <hi>Bassa,</hi> with whom in the
Presence of <hi>Sandaeus,</hi> I had a long Discourse
concerning the Validity of the Truce I had
made. In the Passage to him there stood
those hardy Youngsters who so much under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued
their Pain; casting my Eye upon
them, the <hi>Bassa</hi> demanded, what I thought
of them? I think, said I, that they are brave
Fellows; only they do that to their Skins,
which I would not do to my Cloaths for I
had rather have them whole than slash'd.
Whereupon the <hi>Bassa</hi> laughed, and dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
us.</p>
               <p>The Day after we came to <hi>Granand,</hi> from
thence to <hi>Gomarra,</hi> the Frontier Garrison of
the Empire, situated on the River <hi>Wage;</hi> on
both sides its Banks the Garrison of the
Place with the Seamen, called their <hi>Nassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dists</hi>
waited for us. Before I passed over the
River, <hi>Sandaeus</hi> came to me, and embracing
me in his Arms, gave me Thanks for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating
his Liberty: He told me plainly, he
thought the <hi>Turks</hi> had but dissembled with
him, and therefore he was in perpetual fear,
lest he should be hauled back to <hi>Constantinople</hi>
to dye in Prison; but now being in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:52279:176"/>
Territories, he acknowledged himself
to be eternally obliged to me.</p>
               <p>A few Days more brought us to <hi>Vienna;
Ferdinand</hi> the Emperor was then at the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Dyet, with his Son <hi>Maximilian,</hi> about
Inaugurating him <hi>King of the Romans.</hi> I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<hi>Cesar</hi> with my Return, and with
<hi>Ebrahim</hi>'s coming, and desired to receive his
Commands concerning him; for he had a
great Desire to wait upon the Emperor at
<hi>Frankford:</hi> His Highness's first Answer was,
That 'twas best for the <hi>Turks</hi> to stay at <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna</hi>
till his Return, for it was not advise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to carry an Enemy through the very
heart of the Country, so long a way as 'twas
from <hi>Vienna</hi> to <hi>Frankford.</hi> And on the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
Delays were dangerous, and might cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Suspicion in the <hi>Turks</hi> for some unfair
dealing. As for <hi>Ebrahim</hi> and his Retinue,
there was no danger in suffering them to
pass thorow the most flourishing part of the
Empire; yea it was desirable rather, that
thereby they might take an Estimate of the
Strength and Greatness thereof, especially
having so great an Opportunity at present, to
take notice at <hi>Frankford</hi> with how great Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity
of all the Electoral Princes <hi>Maximilian</hi>
was chosen and designed Successor to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
his Father: When I wrote back to the
Emperor according to the Purport aforesaid,
he assented that <hi>Ebrahim</hi> and his Retinue
shou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="341" facs="tcp:52279:176"/>
Journey thither by the way of <hi>Prague, Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi>
and <hi>Wirtzburg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ebrahim</hi> passing thorow <hi>Bohemia</hi> was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to perform his Court to Arch-Duke
<hi>Ferdinand,</hi> but the Arch-Duke would have it
<hi>Incognito.</hi> When we were a few Days Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
from <hi>Frankford,</hi> I thought good to Ride
a Day or two's Journey before, to acquaint
the Emperor with some Things relating to
my Embassy; which I did, and came to <hi>Franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
that Day Seven Years but one, wherein
I took my Journey from <hi>Vienna</hi> to <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi>
I was then receiv'd by my Master with
all imaginable Kindness, not that I deserv'd
it, but 'twas his innate Goodness and Custom
so to do. You may imagine with your self,
how joyous a thing it was to me, after so
may Years to be returned safe to the Presence
of my glorious Master, who was pleas'd
kindly to accept of the Fruits of my Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassie;
and told me, that I had done all
Things well, and that I should find the Effects
of his Favour. He came to <hi>Franckford</hi> the
Day before the Inauguration, late in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
when the Gates were shut, and all the
following Day they were not to be opened by
ancient Custom: But his Imperial Majesty
gave express Command that they should be
open'd for the <hi>Turks.</hi> They had a Place as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
them, from whence they might behold
<hi>Cesar</hi> Elect to pass by with great Pomp and
Splendour; it appeared to them a Glorious
and Magnificent Spectacle, for so indeed it
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:52279:177"/>
was<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to behold amongst others of <hi>Cesar</hi>'s
honourable Train; three Dukes or Princes,
each of which could raise a great Army in
his own Territories; to wit, the <hi>Saxon, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia</hi>
and <hi>Brandenburg:</hi> They saw also many
other Monuments of the Dignity and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of The Emperor. A few Days after <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahim</hi>
was introduc'd into his Presence, where
he declar'd his Errands, and presented the
noble Gifts that the <hi>Sultan</hi> had sent him. the
Emperor had confirm'd the Peace, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
him amply, and sent him back with
large Presents to <hi>Soliman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am very willing to leave the Court, as
not being pleas'd with that kind of life, but
some private Businesses doth as yet detain me.
I know the tediousness of Court-Attendance;
much Mischief lyes under an appearance of
Splendor, much of Disguise, but little of
Candor is there; all Courts are subject to
Envy; as faithful Friendship is hard to be
found, where change of Mind may occasion
a Man's sudden Ruine: For Princes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are but Men: I have seen a Man enter
into the Court with a thousand Attendants,
but his Princes Displeasure sent him packing
away scarce one in his Company. A Court
does not know that which is truly good, till
'tis too late; it is altogether lead by Shows,
Shadows, Fallacies, and Popular Mistakes:
As those are fortunate Men who can lead such
a Life in safety; so give me leave to live to
the Muses and my self, and to grow old in a
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:52279:177"/>
Country Cottage, but with some few and
trusty Friends; if any life be desirable in this
earthly Pilgrimage, 'tis this, or none at all.
Look upon the Court, and you will find there
a debauch'd Noble preferr'd before a good
Man. So that he that would represent a
good Man amongst Courtiers, must paint
as Ass amongst Apes. I speak of common
Courts, for I know that our Court, as well
as some others, are illustrated with many
Excellent and Noble Personages. However<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Solitude and Quiet affording Vacation to
Study, is preferr'd by me before the Croud
and Noise of Courts. But I am afraid, lest
the best of Princes should stop my Retreats.
'Tis true, he gave me leave to depart, but
upon this Condition, that I should return
when call'd upon. If he commands me to
Court again, (for who am I that can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the Desire of so Gracious a Prince:)
This one truly Comfort will be left me, that
I shall behold every Day the Face of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutest
of all Emperors; (or to Phrase it
otherwise) to Contemplate the living Image
of true Vertue. For assure your self, that
the Sun never Beautify'd a better Prince then
this, nor one who carries and weilds the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
more justly. Though it be true, that the
Majesty of Empire is a Glorious Thing, yet
to desire Empire, and to carry ones self wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of it, is more Glorious. I speak not of
his Birth, nor the Nobleness of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
he needs not such forreign Helps; his
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:52279:178"/>
own Vertue is prop enough. Many Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
have been, though unworthy, rais'd to
the Throne; but his own Vertue raised him
thereunto.</p>
               <p>Again, Some have manag'd the beginning
of their Reign innocently and justly, but
soon after they have degenerated into licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of Life, and corrupt Manners of all
sorts: Forgetting themselves to be Men,
they would be esteem'd as Gods, and ador'd
as such, endeavouring to be plac'd among
the Gods; whereas they were unworthy to be
reckon'd in the number of Men. All Men's
Necks cannot bear the Burden of an high
Estate, to which if they are advanc'd, they
forget themselves. 'Tis an hard thing to
be able to compass all that a Man desires, and
and yet tis as hard to desire nothing but that
which is good. But as for our Prince his Eyes
are not dazled by Greatness; no Man retains
Vertue more constantly than he, nor takes
greater heed that his pure Mind be not
defiled by the hate of his Fortune. He was
always of this Opinion, That as Majestick
Robes do affect the Eyes of Spectators, so the
Sanctity of Manners should much more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
their Minds. Whereupon he highly
studies Piety, is a holy Worshipper and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorer
of God, and lives always as in his Sight
and Presence; he squares all his Actions
throughout the whole course of his Life by a
Divine Rule an Prescript: Whatever happens
either Prosperous or Adverse, he looks upon
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:52279:178"/>
God as the Author, and receives it gratefully
as proceeding from his Hand. Thus he lives
an Heavenly Life even upon the Earth; he is
not ignorant, whose Image he bears, and
therefore all his Words and Deeds are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
for the Public Good, for which he
thinks he was Born, and therefore Prefers
it before his Private Advantages; He is so
Intent herein, that some blame him for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over-much addicted to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
and neglecting his own Children and
Family: He is extreamly Courteous to all
his Subjects, as if they were under his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Care, and Himself the Father of so vast
a Family. What poor Man hath ever desired
his help in vain? Who is there that hath not
experienced his Liberality? He thinks that
Day lost wherein he hath not done some
Good to some body. As he is Beneficent to
all, so he is singular kind to his Domesticks:
not a Man of them can say, that ever he was
neglected by them. He knows their way of
Life, the Deserts, yea and the very Names
even of the meanest of them: Tho' he be so
great a Prince, yet he counts it not below
himself, at convenient Opportunity to warn
the Negligent, and put them in mind of their
Duty; and if they mend their Manners, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
them accordingly: So that they depart
from him, rather as from a Father than a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
'Tis also his Guise, his Custom, when
he hath been angry with his Servants for some
Days, when upon his Amendment he hath
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:52279:179"/>
pardon'd him, the memory of the Injury is
quite forgotten, he esteems them as much as
he did before. He Administers Justice with
great Equity, and that to himself as well
as others, for he thinks it unreasonable to
prescribe Laws to others, and break them
himself; or to punish them in others, which
he allows in himself. His passions are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
and confin'd within the Rule of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
his Life is free from Hate, he knows
not how to be Angry, nor to reproach others;
there is no Man living that ever heard him
Backbite, though they were none of his
Friends: He never speaks rudely of any Man,
and his Speech is alway honourable concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them in their absence; Probity is safe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Guardianship; but malice, force, fraud,
Evil, and bad Manners are exterminated, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
and wickednesses duly punish'd. The
old <hi>Romans</hi> had Censors of Manners impos'd
upon them, to retain the People in their
Duty; but here ther is no need of any Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,
the Life of the Prince is Censors e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;
he is an Example to all, what they
should fly and what they should follow. Good
and learned Men which may profit the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
he highly esteems, with these he
is Conversant, and laying aside His Majesty,
Treats them Friendly as his Equals; yea, He
Emulates their Vertues without respect, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were Paternal and Hereditary, or
gotten by their own Industry. With these
he spends the little time he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eft from
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:52279:179"/>
Publick Business: These are the Persons
highly Esteem'd by him, as judging it a
Publick Benefit to restore due Honour unto
Vertue. He himself being curious by Nature,
and desirous to know something worthy of a
Man, has always some Questions to propound
the Learned, and sometimes he interposes
some witty Querks of his own to the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his Hearers. Thus he hath got a
considerable Stock of Learning, so that you
can hardly question him in any thing, but he
can give you some account thereof. He is
skilful in many Tongues; first, in the <hi>Spanish</hi>
which is his <hi>Mother's Tongue,</hi> next in the
<hi>French, German, Latin,</hi> and <hi>Italian;</hi> He can
Express himself pretty handsomly in the
<hi>Latin,</hi> yet not so, but that sometimes he
breaks <hi>Priscian</hi>'s Head, a Fault blame-worthy
in a <hi>Grammarian,</hi> but allowable in an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.</p>
               <p>What I have said of him, all Men living
know to be true, but perhaps some impute
this as a Defect, that he is not so much given
to Alms, nor is not a Military Person: For,
say they, the <hi>Turks</hi> carry all in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and
we don't Help nor Relieve them as we ought;
we should have Fought them, not Languages,
and joyn'd Armies in the Field; that it might
be known whom Providence would have to
bear Rule: I confess this Objection savours of
Darkness, more than of Prudence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let me fetch the Matter a little higher.
I am of this Opinion, That the <hi>Genius</hi> of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:52279:180"/>
is to be judg'd of rather by their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
than by their Fortunes or Events, and
that by those Councils, the Times, our own
Strength, the Nature and Power of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
is to be Regulated. If a Common E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
well known to us, and Famous for no
Victory, should Invade our Borders, 'twere
Cowardice not to oppose them if we have
Force enough. But if the Enemy be such
who seem sent as a Scourge from God, (such
was <hi>Atala</hi> of old, <hi>Tamarlane</hi> in the Days of
our Forefathers, and the <hi>Ottoman Princes</hi> in
our Age) Whom nothing can withstand, who
lays all waste before him, to Oppose such an
Enemy with small and new levied Forces,
would not be only Rash, but even Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
it self. <hi>Solyman</hi> comes terrible, I say,
by his own and his Ancestor's Successes: He
Invades <hi>Hungary</hi> with 20000 Horse, he
draws near to <hi>Austria,</hi> and threatens the
rest of <hi>Germany;</hi> his Troops are fetch'd from
the very Confines of <hi>Persia;</hi> his Army is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
with many Nations, each of the Three
known Parts of the World Conspire
therein for our Destruction: He like Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
strikes down all before him with his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
Army, of the Terror of his Name, he
roars and Hovers in our Borders, striving to
break in sometimes here, sometimes there.
Some Nations of old when they have been
threatned with such and such Potent Enemies,
have left their Native Country, and have
sought out other Habitations. To be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:52279:180"/>
in small Dangers, is but a mean kind
of Praise; but not to be Terrify'd by the
coming of so great an Enemy, who has laid
Waste so many bordering Kingdoms, seems
to me an <hi>Herodian</hi> kind of Constancy. Amidst
these Dangers <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Heroically abides
in the same Place, he deserts not his Station;
but being of an unconquer'd Spirit, abides in
the same Seat and State: He could wish his
Forces were sufficient to put all to the hazard
of a Battel, and that nothing of Madness
were imputable to him upon that account;
but Prudence doth moderate his generous
Efforts: He sees with what a great Hazard
of his Faithful Subjects, and the Ruine of all
Christendom, and unsuccessful Battel will be
fought, and that the Publick should pay for
his Rashness, is very unwilling; he considers
how unequal the Combat would be between
25 or 30000 Foot, with a small number of
Horse, and 200000, supported with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
Body of Foot, what Hopes there may
be of Success in that Case, the Example of
former Times, and the Blood-shed at <hi>Nica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi>
and at <hi>Varna,</hi> and the Fields of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hach,</hi>
as yet white with the Bones of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
slain there, do sufficiently inform us.
'Tis the part of a foolish Commander with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
duly weighing his own and the Enemies
Strength to rush into Battel, where his Loss
can be only excus'd with an unwise, <hi>I had
not thought.</hi> 'Tis all in all what the Enemy
is with whom we are to cope, wherein if you
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:52279:181"/>
will not believe, yet you may believe the
gravest Author that ever wrote of Military
Affairs; such was <hi>Cesar,</hi> he counted it a Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
to <hi>Lucull<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> and to <hi>Pompey,</hi> that they
had to do with a sloathful Enemy, over
whom they got Victories without Dust or
Sweat; and when he himself had obtained
such an easie Victory over <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> he was
wont in jest to say, <hi>I came, I saw, I overcame:</hi>
But if he had had to do with the People of
those Countries, then Esseminated by Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but now hardned by Want, Frugality,
Hunger, Cold, and Severity of Discipline,
unto all Patience and Audacity, he would
have told us another story. Hence it is, that
<hi>Livy</hi> reasons upon good grounds, that <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
the <hi>Macedonian</hi> would not have had the
same Success against the <hi>Roman Enemy,</hi> as
against the <hi>Persian</hi> or Womanish <hi>Indian:</hi>
There is a great deal of difference between a
Warlike and a Luxurious People, and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
to Arms. 'Tis true, the Multitude
of <hi>Persians,</hi> struck an Admiration, <hi>That there
was more Toil in Killing, than in Overcoming
them.</hi> And in my Judgment, <hi>Hannibal's</hi> Three
Victories at <hi>Trebia</hi> at <hi>Thrasymine,</hi> and at
<hi>Cannae,</hi> did far Exceed all the Exploits of
<hi>Alexander:</hi> For why? the one overcame Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
Warriors, the other had to do with
the sloathful People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fabius maximus</hi> had as much Courage, as
<hi>Titus, Sempronius, Caius, Flaminius,</hi> or <hi>Varro;</hi>
but he had more Judgment: That great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:52279:181"/>
knew that he had to do with an
Enemy educated in the Camp, always vers'd
in Arms, skilful in Military Discipline, who
by a singular Fate or Felicity, had obtained
many Trophies; and therefore he was not
rashly to Venture all, but to use Delay to
weary him out; that was the only Hope left
against so great an Enemy to evade his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults,
and to drill on the Combat till an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
was afforded for a Remedy. In the
mean time, he was to be watch'd, restrain'd,
and as it were, nibbl'd at; wherein he was
so happy, that <hi>Fabius,</hi> one as much Renown'd
as <hi>Scipio</hi> himself, who ended the War against
<hi>Hannibal;</hi> for who knows whether <hi>Scipio</hi>
would have ever overcome him, if <hi>Fabius</hi> had
not first stopt the Course of his Victories; to
overcome by Prudence is as highly to be
priz'd, as to overcome by Force. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
have nothing common with Beasts, but
Force has.</p>
               <p>The Emperor <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had the same De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
with <hi>Fabius maximus,</hi> if his and <hi>Solyman</hi>'s
Forces had been equal; his first Work would
have been, to put all to the hazard of a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel;
but the inequality consider'd, his next
Design was, to stop an over-flowing Flood in
Walls and Banks, and herein employ'd his
utmost Endeavour. 'Tis about Forty Years
since <hi>Solyman</hi> in the beginning of his Reign
took <hi>Belgrade,</hi> slew <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi>
and thereby promis'd himself the possession
of that and other Countries; in hope where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:52279:182"/>
he Besieg'd <hi>Vienna,</hi> and renewing the War,
he reduc'd <hi>Ghnitzium</hi> again, threaten'd <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
at a distance. But what did he get by this
great Preparation of Arms, his vast and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
Forces? He was forc'd to stick in
that part of <hi>Hungary</hi> which he had already
taken. He that was wont to Conquer vast
Kingdoms by one Expedition, did now sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
only some weak Castles and small Towns,
which cost him dear: 'Tis true, he saw <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna</hi>
once, but never after: 'Tis said, that
<hi>Solyman</hi> wish'd his Life to be prolonged, to see
three Things finish'd; <hi>viz.</hi> The Structure of
his Temple, a sumptuous and magnificent
Work; the repairing of the old Aquaeducts
to bring Water enough into <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
and the Conquest of <hi>Vienna;</hi> the two first he
hath accomplish'd, but at the third he sticks,
and I hope ever will; so that he always calls
<hi>Vienna,</hi> his <hi>Ignominy</hi> and <hi>Disgrace.</hi> But to
return.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Emperor</hi> Ferdinand <hi>may doubtless be
Register'd among the famousest Captains, for
though he had far less Aid than the Danger
requir'd; yet he was Master of himself, and
principally by his Courage, he hath endured
so great an Impression of a Powerful Enemy
for so many Years together: So that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
a greater Praise for the preserving a
great part of</hi> Hungary <hi>for better Times, than
many Warriors do, who with multitude of
Military Preparations, and favourable Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
have got many Victories over
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:52279:182"/>
Kings and their Armies, The less Assistance
he hath had in a necessary Time, by so much
the more, the Valour of his Mind hath more
Eminently appear'd: Whosoever doth not
put all upon one Event and the height of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
not considering the Power of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
and the seasonableness of Assaulting
him, must needs conclude,</hi> That 'tis next
to a <hi>PRODIGY,</hi> that the kingdom of
<hi>Hungary,</hi> distracted with long Discord, was
able to be defended so long, and that all of it
is not already brought under the Yoak of so pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
an Enemy: 'Tis God's great Mercy, and
our Princes infinite Care that hath prevented it,
whilst he is Combating with one Difficulty, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
arises in view, greater than the former. The
Enemy is in sight, Friends afar off, the Auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of his Brother <hi>Charles</hi> too far off <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi>
though next to the Fire, yet weary in send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Aid; the hereditary Countries exhausted
by Contribution, and the Ears of many Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Princes deaf when Aid is desir'd of them;
would rather do any thing, than that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
upon them; upon that he is forced to sustain
the Enemy only with his own Arms, with the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of some <hi>Hungarians, Austrians,</hi> and
<hi>Bohemians,</hi> and sometimes by hiring some <hi>Italian</hi>
or <hi>Spanish</hi> Soldiers at a vast Expence; he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
the Confines of <hi>Hungary</hi> with Garrisons
fifteen Days Iourney long; so that he had always
Soldiers in Pay, even in time of Truce: A Truce
is sometimes necessary, and when the coming of a
Tyrant is fear'd, and the Time affords not the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:52279:183"/>
Opportunity of Resistance, 'tis seasonable to send
Embassies, and to mitigate him at present, that
so great a Calamity may be averted from misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Hungary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilst our <hi>Prince</hi> is exercised with these
Fears, he can hardly sleep a whole Night
together, he watches for the Good of the
Common-wealth; so great a Matter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
a perpetual Vigilance and constant
Care: And do not you think I slatter him?
what I write is as true as History. He hath
but few Assistants in his Government, but
very good Men; the Chief of whom, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to you be Name, are, <hi>Iohanes Trane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
Rudolphus Harva,</hi> both Eminent for their
Faithfulness and Prudence.</p>
               <p>I shall dismiss you after I have acquainted
you with our Prince's private Deportment,
he rises every Day at Five a Clock in the
Morning, even in the coldest Winter Months;
and first, he performs his Prayers to God,
then he goes to the Council to Treat of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
pertaining to the Publick Good, till
Dinner-time; he follows the same course in
the Afternoon, till Supper-time: I mean his
Counsellors Supper, not his own; for he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
never Sups, eating but once a Day, and
that sparingly too; and he is as abstainous
in Drinking; only he closes his Dinner with
a double Glass of Wine; he passes the Night
chastly ever since the loss of his Royal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort:
He can't endure Toys nor Trifles, which
others are taken with; He will have nothing
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:52279:183"/>
to do with Jesters, Fools, Parasites, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Delights, and yet Plagues of Courts:
He hates Idleness, he is a very great Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
of his Time, if he has any to spare from
publick Business, which is but rare; he spends
it in Conference with good and learned Men,
who are his great Delight, and do ordinarily
attend him while he is at Dinner, mingling
Discourses concerning several Things. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that several of the Commons would
not change their Life for his, 'tis so strict
and severe: What Man is there that does
not set apart some part of his Time to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
his own <hi>Genius?</hi> Who would willingly
deprive himself of all Delights? To whom
would it not seem irksom to grow old in
perpetual Care and Business. This seems
like a Servitude, not a Domination: But
our Prince is of another mind; neither doth
he dissemble it in his ordinary Discourse: He
says, He was Advanc'd to so great an Office
by God, not for his own sake, that the
Reins of Government were not put into his
Hands to wallow in Pleasures and Delights:
The case of Succession in Kingdoms and
Empires, differs from the condition of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Inheritances; in these latter no Man is
deny'd to indulge himself in the Convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of his Patrimony. But so many Nations
are intrusted to him by God, that he might
have the Care and Labour, and they the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of his Care, so that they should obtain
Rest and Quiet by his Sweat.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:52279:184"/>
In Hunting alone he spends a little time,
not so much for Delights-sake, as for Health;
as when he finds his Body to decay, and his
Mind to sink, by continual sitting many Days
together, he chooses one Day to refresh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with the freer Air in the open Field;
and that Day early in the Morning, and in
Winter some Hours before Sun-rising, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Weather soever it be, he goes abroad
to Hunting, and sometimes he does it in the
Afternoon; for I remember when I attended
him at Dinner, I heard him say; <hi>I have done
my Duty this Day;</hi> I have dispatch'd all Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesses
that are on the File, I will spend the
rest of the Day on the Care of my Body.
Thus he returns late at Night with the
slaughter of a Boar, Stag, or Bear, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
his wearied Limbs to rest, without Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Drinking. Let no Man then upbraid
with the want of <hi>Trajans, Veruces,</hi> and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius</hi>'s;
those Miracles of the Ancients in
our Days: I dare take my Oath, that there
is more true Vertue in our Emperor, than
there was in all of them put together. But
the Admiration of so great a Man transports
me; 'Tis not my Design to speak of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
they require a Volume not an Epistle;
besides they require an Ingenuity far exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mine; and therefore my end was only to
put you in mind of these Things, <hi>that you
may know what Master I serv'd.</hi> I close all with
this publick Prayer, <hi>That he may return late
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:52279:184"/>
to Heaven, whose Vertuous and Sanctimonious
Presence, alleviates the Miseries of our Age.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the <hi>Greek-Books</hi> which you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after, and the Rarities, and the wild
Beasts of an unusual kind, which you hear I
have brought back; they are hardly worth
the mentioning: Amongst them, there is
one <hi>Iohneumon</hi> very gentle, which is known
for its cruel hate with the <hi>Crocodile</hi> and <hi>Asps;</hi>
I had also a <hi>Weazle</hi> of that kind, as they
call <hi>Musk-Cats,</hi> very beautiful; but I lost
that on the way: I have many brave Horses,
such as no Man ever brought from thence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and six She-Camels: I brought back no
Shrubs nor Herbs, but in Picture, which I
left in the Care of <hi>Mathiolus,</hi> with some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ngs, many years ago. I sent him
Tapestry and Linnen after the <hi>Babylonian</hi>
fashion, with Swords, Bows, and other Trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
I have also many other Things made of
Horse-Hides, curiously wrought after the
<hi>Turkish</hi> fashion; 'twas better to say, I had
them; for in so great an Assembly of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Men and Women at <hi>Francfort,</hi> one ask'd
one Thing, and another another; so that I
have but a small matter left: the rest of my
Gift was well bestow'd; but I was sorry that I
was prodigal of one Balsom, Because Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
call the truth of it into question, as not
answering all the Marks that <hi>Pliny</hi> gives of
it: Whether it be that the force of those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Plants from whence it flows, be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by age, or from any other cause; this I
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:52279:185"/>
know for certain, that it flows from Shrubs
In the <hi>Mattarcan Gardens</hi> near <hi>Cairo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I left <hi>Constantinople,</hi> I sent one <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercarus</hi>
a <hi>Spanish Physician</hi> into <hi>Lemnos,</hi> on
the Sixth Day of <hi>August,</hi> to be present at
the digging out that noble Earth, desiring
him to write me the certainty concerning its
Place, Origin, manner of Extracting and
Use, which I know he will do, if he be not
hinder'd: I had a mind to go thither my
self to be an Eye-witness thereof; but the
<hi>Turks</hi> not giving me leave, I deputed him in
my stead: I bring back also abundance of
old Coins, the chief of which I shall present
my Master with. Besides, I have whole
Waggon-loads, if not Ship-loads of <hi>Greek
Manuscripts,</hi> and about 240 Books, which I
sent by Sea to <hi>Venice,</hi> from thence to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to <hi>Vienna:</hi> I design them for <hi>Cesar's</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary;
there are many of them common, but
some choice; I rumag'd every Corner to
procure such kind of Merchandize as my
last gleaning.</p>
               <p>I left one behind at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> all very
well written in great Letters; it was <hi>Diasco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides,</hi>
with the Figures of Plants, wherein
there were some few Things of <hi>Cretiva,</hi> and
the Book of Birds; 'tis in the possession of a
<hi>Iew,</hi> the Son of <hi>Hammon,</hi> who in his Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
was <hi>Solyman</hi>'s Physician: I desir'd to
buy it, but the Price frighted me, he rated
it at 100 Duckats; a Price fit for <hi>Cesar</hi>'s
Purse, not mine; however I will not cease to
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:52279:185"/>
press <hi>Cesar</hi> to redeem so Famous an Author
from that Bondage: 'tis very much injur'd
by Time, and so eaten with Worms on the
out-side, that a Man will harrdly take it up
if it lay in the Streets.</p>
               <p>But enough of Letters, you may expect my
self very shortly; I shall reserve what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
till we meet: In the mean time, do
you take Care to provide some good and
learned Men, by whose Conversation and
Discourse, I may wipe-away all that tedious
Irksomness remaining in my Mind, from my
long abode among the <hi>Turks.</hi>

            <p>WHen the City <hi>Sardis</hi> was taken
by <hi>Caius</hi> King of the <hi>Persians,</hi>
his Soldiers were ransacking it, &amp;
Slaughtering the Inhabitants in every Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
It is Recorded, That one of <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
broke into <hi>Cresus</hi>'s Bed-Chamber, the
King of <hi>Lydia;</hi> and not knowing who he
was, drew his Sword, and would have ran
him through: At which Accident <hi>Cresus</hi>'s
Son was very much moved, but till
that time was Dumb and could not Speak.
But behold the Strings of his Tongue were
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:52279:186"/>
suddenly loosed, crying out, he spake some
words, which deterred the Soldier from slay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King. Thus filial Piety, and the
Groans of his Father's Danger, made him
able to speak, whom Nature had made
Speechless till that very time: The like Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
though on a different Occasion, hath
happened to me, whom Love to my Country
will not suffer me to be any longer mute, no
though I am but a rude and unskilful Orator,
and who never yet offered any thing to Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Cry: But the extream Hazard of my
Country compels me now to roar and cry
out; not that I think that I can thereby daunt
the Enemy from cutting our Throats: (For
his Savageness is such, that he will not be
frightned hereby;) but that I may warn
<hi>Christian Princes</hi> to take heed to themselves,
and that I may warn my Country-men, that
whilst Time lasts they would Aid one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and consult their Safety: For (O Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens!)
what mischievous Unhappiness is
this, and what a Womb of Miseries, that
barbarous Enemy the <hi>Turk</hi> having Conquered
Nations almost without number, by the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
and Destruction of so many Kings and
Kingdoms, hath opened his way to us also,
and points his Sword at the very Throat of
our Country; yet truly we are not concern'd,
nor stir not at all to Aid distressed <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:</hi>
If Fire break out in the City where
we live, every body leaves the Care of his
private affairs and useth endeavours to quench

it: But we, alas, that would be accounted
Lovers of our Country, yet in this her Jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardy,
we do shew our selves only Idle and
Sluggish Spectators; her beauteous Love
which the Enemy will soon spoil, our Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and Religion, which he will soon make
us to abjure, and the silent Supplication of
our Wives and Children, that we would not
suffer them to be hauled into the basest of
Slaveries, do no way affect us. The sloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest
of all Animals when they find their
Young to be in danger, will not be restrained
by any force, but will run through Fire and
Water to help them. And shall we on the
contrary, though valiant Men, betray our
Posterity, and expose them to the Injuries
and Abuses of such cruel Enemies for want
of our Assistance to Relieve them. For pray
tell me what other Hopes can you have?
what<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Defence? what Safeguards? Can you
place any Hope in the Goodness and Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
of that Enemy, who since he publickly
shewed himself upon the Stage of the World,
hath caused Rivers of Humane Blood conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
to flow? Or can you put any Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in his Equity and Moderation? Alas,
he values not Peace nor Leagues, not a Straw,
no Common Laws of other Nations are a
jot regarded by him, no Modesty, nor no
Consideration of that which is Honest does
keep him within his Bounds: He will violate
his Faith, his Oath made to any man that is a
Christian, when it is for his own Advantage;
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:52279:188"/>
he thinks it so far from being a Sin, that he
counts it a pious and a sacred Thing. Beside,
his profane Religion stirs him up against us;
the Emulation of his Ancestors, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of inlarging his Empire, puts Arms into
his Hands; and that cursed and insatiable
Thirst after all our Estates hurries him on
upon us. For we are quite beside the Cushi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
if we imagine that either our Conscience,
or our Forgetfulness of Injury received, will
contribute at all to our Security; no, the
modester we are, and the more observant of
Peace and of Leagues, and of that which is
just and right, we shew our selves to be, by
so much the more we shall provoke the Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of this Enemy aginst us; for we owe
not these things to our Valour or Goodness,
but to our Fear, Sluggishness, and despair of
our own Affairs. And the truth is, we have
no reason to put any Trust in our Enemy, if
we have none in our selves; and in this case,
what remains but we do as Men that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Sentence of Death, quietly to
prepare our selves for our last Stroke, with
blinded Eyes to receive the Blow. And if
you should imagine that either his Force or
his Fortune should fail him, we may answer
our selves, by considering that from an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
Original his Victories obtained both
by Land and Sea, and that in a very short
space of Time have made him Famous all the
World over? The Fire began by him, from
such beginnings he hath almost consumed the
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:52279:189"/>
greatest part of the World. The Eastern
People being wearied by him do dread his
Arms; as the <hi>Assyrians, Barbarians,</hi> and <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans,</hi>
the Edge of whose Sword even the
<hi>Sythians</hi> themselves now also have often felt,
and the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> too in another part of the
World, who were formerly secured by the
Heat of the Country, I need say nothing of
<hi>Europe,</hi> for we have seen <hi>Belgrade</hi> taken, <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna</hi>
Besieged, and Preys driven even from
the Gates of <hi>Lintz;</hi> Such towards our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
hath <hi>Solyman</hi> alone been able to
make, besides his other Victories: But alas,
'tis the Guise of our Christian Kings to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
Peace among themselves from Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to Generation, though it be but for a
Spot of Land, whereas every single Emperor
of the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> (I speak it with as much
Grief as Truth) have heaped up KING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOMS
upon KINGDOMS by their
Victorious Success: So that as many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
as those once flourishing Nations, the
<hi>Assyrians,</hi> the <hi>Persians,</hi> the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and
the <hi>Romans,</hi> so Comprehended within the
Bounds of their Empires; the <hi>Turks</hi> alone
now seem to possess. And will not all this
make us to see our Danger? What Sea is
there? what Mountains? what Desarts? What
remnant of People between them and us, from
whom we can expect any Relief against their
Injuries? No, all is lost and spoiled. Alas,
their Swords are at our very Throats, who
should have struck a Terrour to us at a far
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:52279:189"/>
greater distance; so that now the very Blood
of our Country, and our own last Breath, is
like a Sanguinary Quinsie, and we have not
this crum of Comfort left us, which is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
found even in the greatest Calamities,
that we can have any solid ground of hope,
that these our Miseries be not long lived.
Other Barbarous Nations have oftentimes
brought grievous Calamities on many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Provinces by sudden Tempest; thus
the <hi>Goths, Vandals, Huns</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi>
have over-run many Countries, and brought
great Havock upon them; which Miseries
seemed the more tolerable, because there was
hopes that they would not be perpetual:
And therefore after the Storm was over,
those Places which were Weather-beaten and
almost destroy'd, did again recover their
former Splendor. But this Enemy is so
watchful, and observes that strict Discipline
and Course, in preserving the Places that he
hath gotten, that when he Rules and Reigns,
and hath once set his Foot, he suffers not
himself to be removed from thence: So that
to speak by way of Allusion, That Corn can
never ripen again, whom once his Horses
heels hath trodden to the Ground. So that
it is hard to discern, whether he be more
happy in acquiring, or more resolute in
maintaining his Conquests.</p>
            <p>Seeing then we are surrounded with so
great Dangers, Why do we not lay our
Heads together? Why do we not try all
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:52279:190"/>
ways, and turn every Stone? Why doth
the ingenious Necessity which would ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
admirable Works, lie stupid and
dormant in us? The wildest of Beasts may
be our Authors in this place, apprehending
themselves in the greatest danger; how
strongly will they strive for their own liberty,
who in a case of Life and Death, will vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly
set up and attempt any thing for their
liberty; they will try all means, that so
they may find a way to escape: In fine,
They will lose their Life rather than their
Liberty.</p>
            <p>But perhaps some may make this Objection,
What then do you advise to secure the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
State of Affairs, against the Dangers
and Mischiefs that hang over our Heads?
It is easie for any body to do: But what
Remedy is there for it? This is the Question
we ask of you; speak something to this Head
if you can say any thing.</p>
            <p>I answer, I will take you at your word, and
will declare my mind, and that in short: First
is to be used Arms; Arms must be opposed to
Arms; nothing can well be done without
Arms; the Safety of our Country is to be
maintained by Sword and Buckler, or we must
all Perish, every Man: This is as true as the
Gospel, but God forbid that it should be; let
us rather fly to our Arms, which are not hid
under Ground; and if they were, yet we
were with great Diligence to pluck them out;
neither are they to be far fetch'd from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:52279:190"/>
Countries, but they are near us, they
are ready, and, if we will our selves, we have
them in our hands. There are gallant Men
enough bred up amongst us; we have a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Youth fit for War, who are ready
to spend the last drop of their Blood for
their Country and for their Religion: We
want neither Horses, nor Iron, nor Gold,
nor Forces, nor Engines, nor great Guns,
nor other Utensils for War; the Divine
Bounty hath largely supplied us with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
hand, with all things necessary to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
and perfect great Designs, provided
always that we do not refuse to make use of
them. I say, we want only Will, and force
of Hands, which we ought seasonably to apply,
while a competency of Strength remains, and
before all things run to rack irreconcilably;
for otherwise we may look back upon neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
Advice, when it is in vain and to no
purpose; and then we shall be served as those
Sick Men, who whilst it was seasonable, and
their Strength entire, did even kick at the
mention of Physick; and could by no manner
of means be perswaded to make use of Health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Potions in season; but when the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
is pass'd, and the Disease is come to
the heighth, that their weakned Bodies can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bear Physick, then they seek for the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
and his Remedy to no purpose. Their
Example ought to forewarn us before the
Enemy hath wounded us all over, and whilst
no Wounds are Mortal, and whilst we have
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:52279:191"/>
yet some Blood left in our Veins; to apply a
Remedy in time; that is, to hasten to our
Arms: to prepare our selves vigorously for
our Defence.</p>
            <p>If we do thus, then we may make our
Supplications to God, and may fairly hope
that he will not turn his Back to us; but
if we pretend Piety as a Cloak for our
Sloathfulness, think to take a shorter cut,
which is, to implore the Divine Aid against
the Mischiefs that hang over our Heads by
Prayer, without our own Pains, Labour and
Study, certainly God will turn the Deaf Ear
to so unjust a Petition. No, we ought in the
first place to do our own Duty, and to fill up
the Measure of Diligence, Stoutness and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
which God hath given us principally
for this end and purpose. We should imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the Husband-man, who doth in vain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a plentiful Harvest from God, unless he
first Plow, Sow and Reap. God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
a sure and fixed Order in these Sublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Things, which by no means ought to be
slighted or neglected; hath propounded many
Rewards to Pains-taking, Diligence, Assiduity,
Cunning, and to Virtue; which he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
to Sloathfulness. Would you be a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
would you understand Musick, Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,
or the Mathematicks, you must first
take pains to learn them, and that with
might and main? Heaven will not Inspire you
with these things if you be Idle; no, you
must take Pains to attain them in that way,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:52279:191"/>
and by those designs which God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
he hath given you means to attain them,
provided you be not wanting to your self;
make use of them in the first place, and then
God will give you his Blessing and Increase.
In the like manner, would you defend your
Country, would you conquer your Enemy,
and would you enjoy Victory, you will never
be able to do it by sitting Idly and Sloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
at home; no, you must up and be doing,
take Arms in hand, and exercise diligently
therein; you must confine your self to Toil,
to Heat, to Drouth, to Hunger.</p>
            <p>Being thus accoutred you may implore the
Divine Aid; thus you may go hopefully on
into the Field, for you have done that Duty,
and you have duly used the Means which
God hath vouchsafed you; you have observed
his Order, and have not despised the Laws
which he hath fixed; and in this posture we
may commend the Issue of the thing, by our
devout Praise, and Integrity of Life, to his Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
and Goodness. For Victory is not in
our Power, but it is God's Privilege alone to
bestow it; and yet sometimes we see that
those are made Partakers thereof, who do not
lawfully and in due order seek it of him: And
if it happen otherwise sometimes (which it
seldom does) it is next to a Miracle; for we
ought not to tempt God, nor to undertake
any thing rashly. And in my Judgment <hi>Cato</hi>
spoke very pertinently, when he exhorted
the Senate to take Arms against <hi>Catiline,</hi> in
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:52279:192"/>
these words, <hi>It is true, the matter is dangerous,
but you do not fear it, though you ought greatly
so to do: But such is your Sloathfulness and
Effeminacy, that you dally with it, looking one
upon another, as if you trusted in Mortal Gods
for your Safety, who have oftentimes preserved
this Common-wealth in the greatest of Dangers.
I must tell you, that the Aid of God is obtained,
not by bear Wishes and womanish Complaints:
No. But if we be Vigilant, if we be Active,
if we take Advice, then all things will succeed
prosperously: But if thou give up thy self only to
Wishings and Wandrings, it is in vain to ask
help of the Gods; they are angry, and will s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it in
thy Face. Let us therefore do what belongeth to
us, let us stand armed in our Camp ready for the
Work and Onset, and then we may lawfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
God's Aid and Assistance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here some Good and Thinking Men
lay a Block in my way, alledging, That this
Method to heal our publick Calamities, hath
been oftentimes tried, but never succeeded:
And that Christians, as often as they have
joyned Battle with the Turks, have been
worsted by them.</p>
            <p>I own the Objection, and acknowledge that
there is great weight in it; and the Truth is,
my chief Design in writing this Monitory, was
to give a full answer thereunto. You say
that we have hitherto prevailed by Force of
Arms little against the Turks; grant that it
is so: But pray tell me what Arms we have
used? It is worth our while to dwell a little
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:52279:192"/>
upon this Point. When publick Fame had
informed us, that the Turk, with a numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Army, was infesting our Borders, and
drawing near towards us; it is true indeed,
we endeavoured to gather Forces also; but
what Forces were they, or what manner of
Soldiers did we List; Were they Victorious?
Were they such whose Valour had been proved
in former Battels, and which had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
to Conquer? By no means, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Men of quite another Gizard: Drums
were beaten up all over the Country, and at
their Sound there came in Men higly pigly
for hope of Gain; perhaps three to one of
them had hardly wore a Helmet before, or
ever looked an Enemy in the Face: And the
rest were the Scum of the Country, as Thieves,
Debauchees, Gamesters, Men over Head and
Ears in Debt, and such-like.</p>
            <p>Excepting only a very few, who were not
at all influenced by the Justness of their Cause,
nor by their Love to Religion, nor desire to
exercise their Valour, but by a Licentious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity
for Drinking, Diceing, Plundering,
Whoring, and committing Sacrilege; and in
a word, whom all manner of Flagitious Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
brought together. With such a Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-rout,
or rather with the Horridest or worst
of Mortals, hateful both to God and Man, do
we begin this Sacred War against so great
an Enemy. Hence it is, that our Camps do
seem rather a Riotous Wake, than a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of Soldiers; for amongst them Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:52279:193"/>
Corruption, Lust, Impurity, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Tumults, Brauling, and Blood-shed,
turn all things up-side down. And yet this
is the goodly Soldiery (forsooth) that we are
to raise at great Charge, and also to fetch
from far with much loss of time, when the
matter requires the greatest speed imaginable.
The Luxuries of <hi>Campania</hi> broke the Army
of <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s, which before was hardy and
accustomed to Toil: But as for us we have
need of no <hi>Campania</hi> to debauch us, for our
Soldiers do bring Effeminateness and Feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
enough into the Army when they are first
Listed. And therefore if they meet with no
Enemy to fight with, yet in the space of a
Month, either the Heat of the Dog-days, or
the first pinching Winter Colds, do destroy
our Troops, though never so great. And can
we wonder, if with such Soldiers as these, we
can obtain no Success against such a Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disciplined
Enemy? Alas! If any of us have
a private Grudge one against another, or if
we are to travel through a place infested by
Robbers, we do not go hand over head as
they say, but we commit the guard of our
Persons to such Spectators as will stick by
us: Besides if any Business happen of more
than ordinary weight, we use not to commit
the Management thereof to any, but Men of
great Experience and Skill. But in this grand
Affair, where the Safety of all is at Stake, we
are so careless, that either we send forth an
unsuitable Soldiery, or else such as is almost
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:52279:193"/>
conquered before it looks an Enemy in the
Face; and this heartens an Enemy whom so
many Victories have already made Famous.
I return to what I spoke in the beginning,
that we must defend the Publick Safety by a
choice and fitting Soldiery, or else we can
have no hopes but to be utterly destroy'd.</p>
            <p>But you will say, What kind of Soldiers
would you have? I answer, Those of our
own Country, and chosen out of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood;
for seeing haste is very available
in Military Affairs, and that it is especially
necessary against so nimble an Enemy as the
<hi>Turks,</hi> we need an Army which is not to be
far fetch'd nor long staid for, but such a one
as is ready at hand, and as it were always at
our call. And we are not to take every one
that comes, or that we light upon by chance;
but having taken enough, all which are able
to take Arms, we are with great Judgment to
cull out the best of them: In which choice we
must take especial care, that we pitch not
upon a Man who hath been daintily bred, and
highly fed; or whom a depraved Education
hath infected with Vice, and Idleness hath
not corrupted; that no Hair-brain'd, Mad,
Contumacious, Turbulent or Seditious Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
be listed; but such only as are not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
but fit to endure Toil; and such as
having a good habit of Body, do in their very
Countenances hold for it a certain Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
Probity, and greatness of Mind. On
which account I had rather fix upon one that
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:52279:194"/>
was accustomed to a Stirring and Laborious,
than to a Sedentary Trade; upon a Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
rather than a Citizen; upon one born
upon a Mountain, rather than in a Valley;
upon a mean Man, rather than a rich Grub.
When you have made this good Choice, then
I would have you instruct the Soldiers in
Military Precepts, and the Knowledge of
Arms; I would have him accustom himself
in his Armour, to handle and brandish his
Pike, with Skill to use his Sword and Pistol,
to keep his Rank, and to march swiftly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Armour; to write true Prose; to
hate Wickedness more than Death; to love
Piety; and in his common Discourse, not to
speak a word reproachfully against God:
The same Person must be obedient to his
Commander, and patiently endure his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
let him be as Furious as he will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his Enemy, but Gentle and Tractable
amongst his Fellow-Soldiers: His Diet should
be sparing, not at all inclinable to Gluttony
or Drunkenness. And in the last place, He
must be content with his Pay, and abstain
from all Plunder, but when his Commander
gives him leave.</p>
            <p>Thus, I say, ought the Soldiers to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplin'd,
who must look so great an Enemy
in the Face: And yet I would not have this
Man to be presently brought into the Army,
he being as yet raw, to joyn him with the
Victorious to fight for all, but rather should
be placed in some Posts or Garrisons, that so
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:52279:194"/>
by Excursions and lighter Combats, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
he arrives to be accustomed to Wars:
And by this means he may be accustomed to
bear Wounds, to endure the sight of an
Enemy, and by degrees to cast off the Fear
which all Novelty is wont to introduce.
When the Soldier is thus disciplined and
train'd, I dare assure you he hath laid a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
for hope of good Success: So that the
chiefest of our Pains and Labour, is, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
to be imploy'd herein, that we may get
Men skillful in Arms, and experienced in
Military Discipline, by whom those Fresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water
Soldiers which I spoke of, may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
in the true and genuine Precepts of
the Art Military: I would have such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
set over these Men, which are full of
Valour, Continence and Sobriety, not at all
tainted with the foul guilt of Avarice; that
so they may not only make this young Fry,
the growing hopes of our common Safety,
skillful at their Weapons; but also by the
Example and Integrity of their Lives, may
shew them the way to all Virtue; that so this
Army may be trusted with our common
Safety, when Opportunity shall be offer'd to
fight an Enemy. And if we have such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
as these, there will be no fear of
false Musters to cheat the common Treasury;
by which Abuse of ordinary Commanders,
we see, by daily Experience, that the King's
Exchequer, though never so full, is hardly
able to pay his Army any long time; and in
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:52279:195"/>
Battel they run a great risk, when Generals,
being deceived by the relation of their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
do believe that their Army consists of
more Men effectually than it really doth.</p>
            <p>But before I proceed, an Opportunity is
here offered to me, to give an Answer to the
Opinions of some good Men, all whose know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
being circumscribed within the Bounds
of that Age and Country wherein they were
born; and having never travelled any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
do highly wonder at what I speak; and
do regret it as a meer unusual and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>npracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
thing; for thus they argue, Our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
did many Famous Exploits in War,
with such kind of Soldiers, and in the same
way of Military Discipline which we use at
this day.</p>
            <p>I confess, by way of Answer, that they did
so, but it was when they coped with Enemies
who were guilty of the same Vices and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
as themselves: As the Army was unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced,
hastily listed, forreign, weak, and
without Discipline on the one side, it was so
on the other; and their Force amongst them
equally guilty, one was as good as the other;
sometimes a Battel was fought with no great
loss on either side: As if two maimed Men,
two blind Men, or two lame Men should fight,
the Match is equal on both sides; but if you
set a Maimed Man to fight with a Sound, a
blind Man with one that sees, a lusty Man
with one that's Lame, you will quickly find a
difference. If we were to fight among our
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:52279:195"/>
selves, with our Neighbours and Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
we might then commit such Errors;
for they being as bad as we, there would be
not great difference between us. But now the
case is alter'd, for we have to do with the
Turks, a Vigilant, Industrious, Sober and
Experienced Enemy, used to Hardships, very
Skillful in, and Observant of Military Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.
But what are they the better for that
you will say? I will tell you, By this means
they have overcome all the Countries from
the very Borders of <hi>Persia,</hi> even to the Walls
of <hi>Vienna.</hi> How our Arms are able to cope
with his, I wish that we were ignorant of, and
that our daily Overthrows were not too dear
a Document to instruct us. And do we as yet
stand in doubt, whether we should defend
our Faults rather than amend them? But you
will farther say, These are new and unusual
things which you propose. I answer, The
reason is, because we have a new and strange
Enemy, whose Power and Skill is such, that
it requires a more than ordinary Diligence to
cope with him.</p>
            <p>The Diseases called the <hi>Sweat</hi> and <hi>French-Pox,</hi>
were heretofore strange and unknown;
and when Physicians, with all their Art, were
not able to Conquer them by common and
ordinary Remedies, at last they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,
by the Deaths of many Patients, to
seek for new Remedies against new Diseases;
and their Diligence herein was so Prosperous,
that both those Diseases, which were uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:52279:196"/>
before, did yield to their Remedies.
This Design of Physicians, we ought to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
in our Wars against the Turks; it is in
vain to use the ordinary Method of Fighting
at this time of day; we must rather take
another course, and apply new Remedies to
new Mischiefs. Though the Truth is, this
Method is not new but most Ancient, by
which the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> to their great
Praise, did heretofore Conquer the whole
World: And it is so far from being unused
in our Age, that the Enemy, of which we
speak, hath used no other means, both to
endanger our Safety, and also in a manner to
equal his Empire with the Roman.</p>
            <p>I shall speak more largely of this hereafter,
when I have answered the Difficulty which
these very Objectors have pre-conceived in
their Minds: For such is the guise of this
Effeminate Age, that if a thing be never so
Excellent and Beneficial, if it hath any thing
of Difficulty in the Execution thereof, is put
by as if it never could be effected. The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of whom I speak, being tainted with
this Imbecility of Mind, having experienced
that they could not prevail in an ordinary
course of Arms; and being deterred from
trying my Method by the Difficulty thereof;
they fall at last to this Opinion, That we
can no way prevent our Destruction, but by
making Peace, or a Truce, with the Turks,
by any means whatsoever: And this their
Opinion they so much hug, as if it were
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:52279:196"/>
               <hi>Iupiter</hi>'s Altar, or the Statue of the Emperor.
And therefore they think that we must turn
every Stone, either by Prayer, or by Price,
or by any unworthy way whatsoever, to make
him our Friend: But they do not consider,
that amongst all Difficulties this is the greatest,
and which we can least of all hope to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.
For can we imagine that such a
Capital Enemy, after that he hath marched
over so many Countries, and taken so much
Pains to come to us, when he sees himself
almost Master of his Wish, and having so
great a subject of Praise, such an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Booty, and such an Occasion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging
his Empire and Religion, that he
should suddenly stop, as if he were Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struck,
and proceed no farther? But grant
there were any hopes of Peace, who is so mad
as to fight with an Enemy so powerful, if he
can help it? Or who is so blind as not to
foresee, that sure Peace is to be preferred
before the doubtful Hazards of War? But
let me tell you, that you quite mistake the
case; for neither Peace nor Truce is in our
Power: We have lost all hopes of Peace,
and therefore are compelled to a War; there
is no room for any Advice or Deliberation of
our own; for we are hurried on by a fatal
Necessity, as unwillingly as we are pushed
on violently to a War, which of necessity we
must manage and go through. Why do we
fruitlesly draw back? Why do we cast about
for delays? Why do we Chouse our selves
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:52279:197"/>
with the vain Dreams of Pacifications? We
vainly fancy to our selves Safety in the midst
of the Flame; and by our Delay we nourish
the Mischief which we might remedy if we
were watchful; and for want of foresight, we
render our Wound uncurable.</p>
            <p>But you will say, It is very good to keep off
the Miseries of a War as long as one can.</p>
            <p>I grant it, unless the Delay tend to heighten
our Miseries soon after, and ingage us to our
certain Ruin: As if a Physician do flatter his
Patient, and defer necessary Remedies, till
the Disease comes to that height, that Death
must inevitably follow. So we see that our
Affairs do sensibly decline; and on the other
side, the Enemy groweth stronger every day;
and as he catches from us to add to his own,
so thereby he doth fairly take his way and
passage to us, and make all things ready to
hasten our Destruction; that so all Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
being removed, he may give us an
Alarum whenever he pleases, and when we
least think of it: With a well-provided Army
he might destroy us as it were fast a-sleep,
and unprovided of all things: All his Designs
tend to this, this is the only thing in his
Eye; at which time, though too late, we shall
think our selves induced to those Straights,
that no hope being left, we must certainly
Perish: And this will be the Issue of our
Delay, and our unseasonable Backwardness;
and therefore I admonish you again and
again, while time is, and the matter will
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:52279:197"/>
bear, that we suffer not our selves to be
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>linded with false Hopes, and so sit still and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o nothing; in which we may remember
how great Overthrows we have received;
and also we may forsee the last Ruin of our
Common-wealth approaching; therefore we
must make use of a quick-sighted Judgment
in the case, least by our mistake in so great
a Matter. We apply false Remedies instead
of true ones, to our dangerous Miseries; and
when we have cast up all our Accounts, and
find upon what Hinge our remaining Hope
turns, foregoing all other Methods, we must
very diligently apply our selves to that alone,
wherein neither Labour, nor Difficulty, nor
Novelty, nor any other Pull-backs to Sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and Feeble Minds, should in the least
make us to slacken our Pace; no, our carriages
must be as high as the Matter is great; so
sublime a Matter requires no low or abject
Frame; rather Necessity requires that we
should be lifted up even above the Capacity of
our Age; and that in part at least, we should
imitate the Valour of those Heroes, who out of
their great Fortitude and Constancy, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the greatest Difficulties; who never
thought any thing more base and unworthy
of themselves, than to be deterred by the
Greatness of any Difficulty or Let, from
bringing the Design to a happy Issue, which
in their thou h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s was conjoyned with the
Dignity and Advantage of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
wherein they lived.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="382" facs="tcp:52279:198"/>
I shall give you an Instance only in one o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
them; and that is, <hi>Lycurgus</hi> the Law-give<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> who having a Design
amongst the rest of his Institutions (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he would commend the best constituted
Commonwealth of the <hi>Persians</hi> to be to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity)
to introduce an Equality of Goods
amongst the Citizens, and equally to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the Estate and Possessions of all, that
what was taken from the Rich might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the Poor; so that no distinction was
to be between the Citizens but what Vertue
made.</p>
            <p>In this Design he met with a great many
Adversaries, especially those which had great
Wealth and personal Estates, and were well
Monied besides. For they took it in great
Disdain, that the Possessions either left them
by their Ancestors, or else got by their own
Industry, should be rent away from them,
and transferred to strange Owners. This
Matter seeming to them both unjust, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
absurd; the great Difficulty of enacting
such a Law, was objected to <hi>Lycurgus.</hi> But
he still persisting in his Purpose, and being
resolved to finish what he thought was right
and wholsom for the Commonwealth, there
arose thereupon daily bro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lings and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Hurly Burlies, in which Scuffles <hi>Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>
lost one of his Eyes: That Accident
might have sufficiently warned the good
Man, how difficult an Enterprize he had
undertaken, and consequently might have
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:52279:198"/>
deterr'd him from persisting in his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize;
but might rather have engaged him
to lay aside his Design of accomplishing a
Thing so successfully attempted, and which
had cost him one of his Eyes. But it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
quite contrary; for this Heroe was
so far from desisting upon the account of his
loss, that it rather added Spurs to him to
prosecute the same Cause the more eagerly.
Neither did he give over, till the Law he had
propounded concerning the eqality of Goods,
was enacted <hi>Nemine contradicente.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being the Foundation of those of his
famous institutions, he established such a
Commonwealth, that the Race will never
have the like, and his Name with a high Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of his Vertue, is Celebrated even
to this very Day. Yet this he did when he
was in fear of no <hi>Turk,</hi> nor of any other
Enemy that threatned Ruine and Destruction
to him: And shall we at this time of Day
withdraw our Soldiers from any Burden,
wherein the stress of our Safety lyeth? For
shame let us shake off this sloathful Temper,
unworthy both of us and the Christian Name;
and leaving off all other vain and fallacious
Thoughts, let us run to our Arms as our
onely Refuge under God. The <hi>Romans</hi>
did so when any great Misery threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
their Commonwealth, they went and
betook themselves to their Arms; they stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
all Law Suits, and the Senate enjoyned
the Consuls to take care that the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth

received no damage. We ought to
do the same much more, for we are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
not only of some common Loss, but even
of the universal Ruine of the <hi>Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</hi>
We must run I say to our Snap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacks,
we must catch up and handle our Arms,
and think of nothing else. Our Military
Discipline which is much depraved, is to be
united, and the old way of fighting is to be
recalled and perfected; we are as it were to
proclaim a Vacation, to shut up Shop, and
set by other Things, to act and perform this
one Thing with our most earnest Endeavours:
This we must do if we would have our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
our Selves, our Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
or lastly, our Religion and Liberties
preserved entirely unto us. For if the <hi>Turks</hi>
prevail, they will not leave us a jot even of
common Honesty, much less any Dignity,
Liberty, or Religion; no Nation in the
World can lose so much as we. Take my
word for it, it is the worst of Mischiefs to be
overcome by the <hi>Turk:</hi> If he Conquer us,
(and I wish he had not a fair Prospect so to
do,) He will make Havock of all, he will
drive, carry away, dissipate, burn, profane,
and tread all Things under foot. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
which Spectacle and Suffering, let us
high to our Weapons, to our Arms, and as
(<hi>Probus</hi>) let us Fight it out. When he was
declared Emperor, the Commonwealth had
received many Losses, which proceeded from
the Corruption of their Military Discipline;
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:52279:200"/>
and therefore his chief Design was to amend
that; and this was the reason that he gave that
first <hi>Motto</hi> to his Soldiers, and his Deeds were
agreeable to the <hi>Motto;</hi> for in a little time
he so advanced and restored what was quite
decayed before, that the common Name
which lay under a Reproach among the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
was again restored to its former Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
and Greatness. Let us follow his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
and use the same Method in Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
let us furbish up our old blunt and rusty
Arms, and make them as good, and shine as
bright as ever. And from which Endeavours,
no Labour and Difficulty ought to avert us,
As I said before; so the Charge and Expence
ought to be the least Difficulty of all. For
when can we lay out our own Money bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
than when our Life it self may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
expended? Or how can we spend
part of our Estates upon more advantagious
Terms, than thereby to preserve the whole?
Herein we do but imitate good Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who spare no cost to inclose, to hedge
about, and to strengthen the Bounds of this
Land, provided they may establish their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
and Possessions in safety thereby; for
they know that an Estate is but a ticklish and
slippery Thing, as long as it is subject to
sudden Casualties, or to the Assaults of
Robbers. Besides, Mariners in a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Tempest use to throw out their most
precious Lading into the Sea, rather than to
endanger the loss of their Ship and of their
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:52279:201"/>
Lives to boot; and Physicians make no scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to cut off one part of Man's Body, if
thereby they provide for the rest of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and of the total remainder. For as long
as such an Enemy is near us, who can promise
to himself any firm or lasting possession of
what he hath; seeing that he may expect eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Day that this wicked Neighbour will take
all from them, and transfer it into his own
Exchequer? To what purpose is it then to
sow, or to reap, to carry home, and to lay up
in Garners, seeing the Enemy counts all thine,
as much his own as what he now possesses,
being formerly taken from the <hi>Asiaticks,</hi>
From the <hi>Grecians,</hi> from the <hi>Thrasians,</hi> from
the <hi>Bulgarians,</hi> from the <hi>Illyrians,</hi> and from
the <hi>Hungarians;</hi> to say nothing of other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?
Our Estates and Possessions are by us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to his Avarice, without a due Guard of
such Soldiers as I have spoken of, as a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Goods, or of rich Houshold stuff cast
out into the Street, without any Repair, and
under no Lock and Key, is open to Thieves.
But if we are so mad as to pretend Want, and
to counterfeit Poverty for our Excuse; let
us take heed left our Enemy, being made
Rich by our Spoils, do not convince us of
a Lye, by our Destruction, and to our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Infamy.</p>
            <p>And yet let me tell you, we need not spend
all that we have, for they require not the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of all that we have, but out of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
we should be very Frugal, and in time
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:52279:201"/>
of War our Expences should be moderate?
and far more easie to be born, than the Cost
which was expended in raising a common
and tumultuary Soldiary. By which means
we shall obtain two Conveniencies; one, that
the Money may not be transported out of
the Bounds of our own Country; the other,
that Officers and Commanders may not have
opportunity unlawfully to enrich themselves;
for now a-days he is counted a brave Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that by such kinds of Stratagems can
cheat and couzen the Commonwealth. But
these things belong to another Place, for at
present I did not design to speak of every
thing particularly, but in general, to give
the Sentiment of the whole Matter.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore imitate the Prudence of
the <hi>Romans,</hi> in providing for the Safety of
their State and Commonwealth, who alway
chose Souldiers of their own to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
for otherwise they had never been
able to repel the fierce Inrodes of the <hi>Gauls,</hi>
or to have coped with the Stubbornness of the
<hi>Italians,</hi> who ever and anon Revolted from
them; nor could they have preferred their
Empire entire against the Force of <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
nor would they ever have triumphed over
<hi>Philip</hi> and over <hi>Antiochus,</hi> unless they
had had Soldiers of their own to fight their Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels,
unless they had followed the Method
which I have spoken of in Training up their
Soldery: 'Tis then seasonable for me at this
time to enlarge upon this Subject, that it
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:52279:202"/>
may plainly appear, that I introduce no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty,
but propound an old Example which
we are to follow. All that have written of
the Affairs of <hi>Rome</hi> do agree in this, as you
may see in their Book. The <hi>Romans</hi> took a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
extraordinary Care in Choosing, in Discipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and in Exercising their young Soldiery.
I shall not tire your patience in citing many
Authorities, but in brief I shall urge only
the Testimony of one grave Author, well
skill'd in the ancient Military Discipline;
and that is <hi>Vegetius,</hi> who in divers places of
his Book, containing the Institutions of the
<hi>Roman Militia,</hi> Dedicated to the Emperor
<hi>Valentinian,</hi> hath these Words; <hi>In every Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
it is not so much the multitude of Soldiers and
unskilful Valour, as Art and Exercise which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the Victory.</hi> For we see that the <hi>Romans</hi>
Conquer'd the whole World, by no other
Method, but by the Exercise of their Arms,
by the Discipline of their Camps, and by
their accustomedness to War; for how else
could the <hi>Romans</hi> being few, have born up
against the numerous Army of the <hi>Gauls?</hi>
How could their low statured Soldiery look
the tall <hi>Germans</hi> in the Face? As for the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
it is a clear case that they exceeded
us not only in their Number, but in the
Strength of their Bodies? The <hi>Africans</hi> were
always Superior to us both in Stratagems
and in Wealth; and it is beyond all doubt,
but that the <hi>Greeks</hi> are Superior to us in
Acts and in Prudence: But a Remedy to all
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:52279:202"/>
these Inconveniencies, was a new Soldiery
discreetly chosen, whom they taught the use
of Arms, whom they taught the Law of Arms,
and strengthned their Discipline by daily
Exercise; they meditated before-hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Events which were wont to happen in
Fights and Battels, and were severe Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Negligent and Sloathful. <hi>For
Skill in Military Affairs doth nourish a Boldness
to Fight. No Man fears to do that which he
believes that he thinks he hath rightly learned to
do: For in a fight, a few Men well Exercised
are likeliest to obtain the Victory; whereas a
rude Rabble of Soldiers is more exposed to the
Slaughter.</hi> Whosoever therefore thinks to
overcome the <hi>Turks</hi> in a publick Fight, by
the Assistance of God, and the Conduct of an
unconquered Empire, let him earnestly desire
to compleat his Troops out of such li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
Soldiers. And he will find in a short
time that such Juniors diligently chosen and
well-trained both in the Morning and in the
Afternoon too, will in handling of their
Arms soon equal those Veterans who Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
the whole World. Neither should
your Imperial Majesty be concerned, because
the Custom is changed which obtained here
before; for your Highness is of that Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
and Felicity, that for the Safety of the
Commonwealth, you can both devise New
Methods, and also restore the Old; every
Design seems difficult before you enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it. To be sure, if knowing, and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:52279:203"/>
Persons be appointed to make the Levies,
a number of Men fit for War, may be easily
Listed and carefully Trained; for Diligence,
Conquers all. 'Tis not length of Age, or
number of Arms which maketh the Art Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
but continual exercise of Arms: An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disciplined
Soldier is alway a craving, though
he hath been Listed never so long, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is
past all doubt, that Rusticks who live in the
open Air, are the fittest to bear Arms; they
are able to endure heat, they care not for
refreshing Shades, they are ignorant of the
use of Baths and other Delights; they are
plain-hearted, contented with a little, and
their Limbs are hardned to endure all Toil;
they learn from their Country Labour, to
deal with Iron, to Plow the Land, and to
bear Burdens. And I know not by what
Fate he is least afraid of Death, who is least
acquainted with the Delights of Life.</p>
            <p>Let us now enquire at what Age Soldiers
ought to be Listed; if we observe the ancient
Custom, none but young Striplings are to
be Listed: For what we learn from ones
Childhood, we imbibe that not only more
speedily, but more perfectly too. Besides
the Skipping and nimble Alacrity is to be
practised before the Body grows stiff with
Age; for it is nimbleness grounded upon
Exercise, that makes a stout Warrior. And
therefore we should List none but young
Men, as <hi>Salust</hi> speaketh, <hi>That as soon as Youth
was able to endure War, it learned the Art Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:52279:203"/>
in their Camps by daily Practice.</hi> For it
is much better, that a Disciplined Youth
should complain, that his Age is not yet fit
for Battel, than that he should grieve that
he has past his sighting-time. And by this
means he may have time enough to learn all;
for the Art-Military is not easily to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
whether you endeavour to teach Horse
or Foot, the use of the Bow; or whether you
would teach a Man in his Armor, all the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures
and Modes of the Art-military; as
that he should not leave his File, nor disturb
his Ranks; and how he should cast his Jave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin
with a good Aim and a strong Arm; as
also how to cast up a Trench, and to fix Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisadoes
knowingly; how to handle his Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
and by side-blows to escape the flying,
Darts; how wishly to avoid a Blow, and
boldly to strike. If a young Soldier be thus
Instructed, he will be so far from Fear, that
it will be a Pleasure to him to meet the stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Enemy in the Field. And therefore
let him that is to List Soldiers, take spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Care that by their Countenances, by
their Eyes, and by the make of all their
Limbs, he choose those that are likely to
make good soldiers, for Stoutness, may be
fore-seen in Men, by many Indications, as
well as in Horses and Dogs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Youth which is designed for Martial
Imployment, be of watchful Eyes, holding
his Head upright, broad Chested, brauny
Shoulders, strong Finger'd, with long Arms,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:52279:204"/>
a thin Belly, with slender Thighs, the Calf
of his Leg and Feet not superfluously big,
but compacted with hardned Nerves. When
you shall find these Marks in a new listed
Soldier, you need not much care whether
he be Tall or no; for it is beter to have Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
Valiant, than high Statured.</p>
            <p>It follows in the next place, that we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of what Trades the Soldiers we choose
or refuse are on: Fishers, Fowlers, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioners,
Whitsters; and all those who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to Female Imployments, are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected:
But Black-smiths, Coach-makers,
Butchers, and such as hunt the Stag and wild
Boar, are fit to make Soldiers of: And to
speak the truth, the Safety of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
turns upon this very Hinge, <hi>viz.</hi> The
Listing of young Sodiers that Excel in
Mind as well as in Body; for the Strength
fa Kingd om, and the Foundation of the
<hi>Roman Name,</hi> do consist in the first choosing
of the Soldiery. Nor are we to think, that
the Impressing of Soldiers is a mean Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that ordinary Persons may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
with. No, <hi>Sertorius</hi> of Old, amongst
the rest of his laudable Qualities, was of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
mind; for the Youth to whom the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the Provinces, and the Stress of the
War is to be committed, ought to be well
born, if such can be had; and also to be of
credible Conversations; for Generosity makes
a man fit to be a Soldier, and he that is
ashamed to run away, becomes thereby a
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:52279:204"/>
Conqueror: What Benefit is it to Discipline
a sluggish Fellow, and to be at vast Expence
to entertain him in a Camp? That Army never
did Conquer in a Battel, where the Press-masters
were negligent in listing their young Soldiery.
We find it by dear and costly Experience,
that our Enemies give us many Overthrows,
because that in a long time of Peace, we are
negligent and careless in calling out our
Soldiery.</p>
            <p>For whilst Gentlemen follow Civil Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
and raw Soldiers are chosen by
Favour and Dissimulation, such Persons take
Arms, as their Masters disdain to imploy
any other ways. Hence it followeth, that
great Men should use great Diligence in chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
out a young Fry of Soldiery: But alas
our long Security has shut this care quite out
of doors: Where can you find a Man that
can teach others any thing but what he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
hath learn'd before? The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi>
were the first who collecting, Experiments of
Fights from Events, induced the Art Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
which is thought to be maintained
either in Valour or in happy Success, to a
Formulary Art, Discipline and Skill; it was
them that first of all commanded the Officers
at Arms to teach their young Soldiery, their
Method and various manner of Fighting.
O Men to be highly praised and admired!
Who were willing to learn that Art princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally,
without which other Arts are to no
purpose: The <hi>Romans</hi> also following their
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:52279:205"/>
Methods, have attained the Precepts of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Discipline, and have written whole Books
concerning it.</p>
            <p>How much the Discipline of the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi>
did prevail in Fight, is sufficiently
declared by the Example of <hi>Xantippus</hi> (to
omit others) who with his <hi>Carthaginians</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<hi>Attillius Regulus</hi> and his conquering
Roman Army, not by Valour, but in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
by Art alone, and took him Prisoner;
and thus by one Combat he triumphantly
made an end of the War. In the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<hi>Hannibal,</hi> when he was about to march
into <hi>Italy,</hi> provided himself of a <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
Doctor of Arms, by whose Advice he
destroyed so many Consuls, and such vast
Legions, that he himself was inferior to them
in Number and in Force. <hi>He therefore that
designs peace, let him prepare himself for War:
He that covets Victory, let him Discipline his
Soldiery diligently before-hand: He that desires
good Successes, must fight by Art not by Thought;
for no body will dare to challenge or provoke that
Enemy whom he knows will conquer him if he joyn
Battel with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was their Custom in Winter-time to
provide Tiles and Slates, and for want of
them Flags and Straw, they covered cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Sheds for the Horse, and certain
Hovels for the Foot, wherein in stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
or windy Weather, their Army was disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd
dry over head; and in other Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days,
when it did neither Rain nor Snow,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:52279:205"/>
then they were trained in the open Field.
This they did constantly, least by intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Custom, the Minds and Bodies of
their Soldiers might be Infeebled. It is also
very convenient for Soldiers, very often to
cut down Woods, to carry Burthens, to leap
over Ditches, to swim in the Sea, or in Rivers,
to march with full speed, or to run in their
Armour, or with their Snap-sacks on their
Backs; for daily labour in the time of Peace,
makes Toil more easie in War. Whether
therefore that Army consists of their own
Legions or of Auxiliaries, be sure to exercise
them every day. <hi>For as a well-exercised Soldier
desires to fight, so an undisciplined one is afraid
of a Battel. Lastly, We must know that in a
Fight, Skill avails more than Strength, for
without Skill at Arms, a Boor is as good as a
Soldier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same <hi>Vegetius</hi> acquaints us with many
excellent things in several places of his Book
relating to the same purpose, which for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
sake I omit, as how young Soldiers ought
to be exercised for a March, to run a Ring,
and to Swimming; besides they are to learn
how to Prick rather than to Cut; and how
to level their Darts or Stones aright; to be
Skillful at the use of the Bow, to carry heavy
Burthens, to keep Rank in an Army, and
carefully to fortifie their Camps. All which
things he that hath a mind may read in him.
I shall only add for a close that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="396" facs="tcp:52279:206"/>He that would use Diligence in the Chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and Exercising of young Soldiers, may
easily raise an Army, able to imitate the
valour of the Ancients; for Martial Hearts
are not degenerated in Men, neither are those
Lands Barren, which brought forth the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians,</hi>
the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and the <hi>Marsians</hi> of
old. No, it is only the taste of Peace which
hath wrought our Men partly to delight in
Idleness, and partly to betake themselves to
Civil Imployments; and by this means the
care of Military Exercises began first to be
neglected, and after that to be di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>used, and
last of all quite forgot. And it is no wonder
that this should happen in our Age, when
after the <hi>Carthagnian</hi> War, for four and
twenty Years or more, Peace, Idleness, and
disuse of Arms, had so enervated those <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
who always used to conquer before that,
in the second <hi>Carthagenian</hi> War <hi>Hannibal</hi> was
too hard for them. Neither could they arrive
at the Haven of Victory, till by the loss of
so many Consuls, of so many Commanders,
and so many Armies, they had again relearn'd
the intermitted Use and Increase of Arms.
<hi>Vpon the whole it follows, the Iuniors are always
to be listed and exercised; for it is cheaper to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
our own Men, than to hire Strangers for
Pay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By these Sayings of <hi>Vegetius</hi> alone, to which
all Historians give their Consent, it is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
manifested for what was the old Warlike
Discipline amongst the <hi>Romans:</hi> Neither was
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:52279:206"/>
it observed by the <hi>Romans</hi> alone, but by the
<hi>Persians</hi> before them, and in some sort by
the <hi>Macedonians</hi> also; and by all other People
who have left a Glorious Name unto Posterity.
As you may see in <hi>Xenophon,</hi> a very skillful
Warrier, who writing of the Method that <hi>Cyrus</hi>
the Great, took in Listing and Exercising his
Soldiers, makes it to be not much different
from the usage of the <hi>Romans</hi> which I have
spoken of. And with an Army thus prepared,
he in a very short time added the Empire of
all the East to his Dominions. I might add
also the Testimony of <hi>Arrianus,</hi> no mean
Writer, who brings in <hi>Alexander</hi> declaiming
against the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and accusing them
as unmindful of Courtesies received from
him, in these words, Philip <hi>my Father,</hi> says
he, <hi>received you into his Care and Protection,
when you were a sort of wandering and vagabond
People, destitute of all things, and many of you
but Shepherds cloathed with Skins; for which also
you are forced continually to fight with the</hi> Illy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
<hi>the</hi> Triballes, <hi>and with the</hi> Thracians
<hi>your Neighbours; he brought you down from the
craggy Mountains into Plains and well-tilled
Vallies; instead of skins he cloathed you with
stately Raiments, he instructed you in Arms, he
taught you Military Discipline, so that now your
Arms and Valour were able to defend you against
your Neighbours, as well as the Situation of your
fortified places,</hi> &amp;c. By which words it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
on what Foundations the much cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
Military Discipline of the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
               <pb n="398" facs="tcp:52279:207"/>
was built, to wit, of Rustick Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers,
and of Shepherds.</p>
            <p>Diodorus Siculus <hi>delivers also what is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the things before spoken:</hi> Philip, <hi>says
he,</hi> when he bent his Mind to recreate their Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Discipline, took special care that his Soldiers
should be well furnished with decent Armour, and
that they should be trained up in Warlike Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises.
<hi>Moreover he found out the Order of
the</hi> Phalangis, <hi>which was proper to the</hi> Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians,
<hi>the Pattern whereof he took from
those Heroes in the</hi> Trojan <hi>War, who joyned
Buckler to Buckler. The same</hi> Diodorus
<hi>speaking of</hi> Alexander<hi>'s taking the City</hi> Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnassus,
<hi>with these valiant Soldiers, now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come</hi>
Veterans, <hi>hath these words,</hi> The <hi>Veteran
Macedons,</hi> who during their whole Lives were
always conversant in Difficulties and Dangers,
and under the Pay of <hi>Philip</hi> often obtained the
Victory, did thus arrive at the highest pitch of
Valour: They excelled others in Prudence, and in
the Knowledge of the Art Military, whilst they
bitterly upbraided the Cowardise of the Fresh-water
Soldiers that refused to fight; they themselves in
the mean time gathering into a Ring, and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Bucklers together, received their Enemy, who
even thought themselves Conquerors before, and
having slain <hi>Ephialtis,</hi> and many others, they
compelled the rest to fly into the City, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great did owe the Conquest
of the East, and the large Extent of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
to the Valour of those Soldiers; but
perhaps the Persons above-mentioned may
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:52279:207"/>
object, That our Times differ from theirs,
those things have been long out of Date, and
that it is a Childish thing to raise them as it
were out of their Graves, and to bring them
into use again: We ought therefore to be
contented with the Wisdom of our own
Age.</p>
            <p>To which I reply. That what was useful in
those Days, is as fit to be used in our Times:
Yet I will not urge Reason to those who will
not willingly hearken thereunto, but I will
lead them to the very Fountain of Experience.
Let me then ask these Objectors, why they
are so over-wise to detract from other Mens
Counsels, and can bring forth no better of
their own. What, will they deny that the
<hi>Turks</hi> are good Soldiers? Perhaps out of
Obstinacy they will not grant them to be such.
I will therefore answer for them, That he
who hath struck such a Terror into the whole
World, and laid all waste before him, upon
the account of his Victories, may well be
reckoned a good Soldier. I ask them again,
How is this Soldier listed, and how is he
train'd up? If they say they know not, I will
tell them what I my self have seen to my own
Cost: A Turkish Soldier is a Man so born,
so listed, so train'd and exercised, as the
<hi>Romans</hi> were of old, and as ours ought to be:
Yea, he is in a worse Condition; for as to
those Soldiers who offer themselves to be
listed, when the <hi>Turk</hi> goes in any Military
Expedition, which they call <hi>Alcangi,</hi> they are
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:52279:208"/>
little esteemed among the <hi>Turks;</hi> that Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
is the only Man, who is continually un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Emperor's Pay, and by Judgment
and good Reason, is at length advanced into
the Sultan's Guards. This Soldiery is thus
chosen, The Sultan sends some Men every
Year into several Provinces, who take away
the third or fourth Child from Christian
Families. When the Drove of these Youths
arrive at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> they who have the
most ingenious Aspect, are chosen out for the
Domestick Uses of the Sultan himself, or of
the Bassa's, or other Nobles; the rest are
brought into a certain place, where abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Country-men meet, and they desire
such or such a Youth from the Overseer of
the Business; he receives from him a piece of
Gold, and delivers him the Youth he desires,
having first taken notice of the Youth's Name,
Country and Condition, with his Age, and
other Marks, whereby he may be known all
his Life-long. All these being recorded, it
is lawful for him, whether he be a Citizen
or a Country-man, to carry the Youth into
<hi>Asia,</hi> or what part of the World soever he
lives in, and there he uses him as his Slave in
continual Toil and Labour: His Food is
Bread and Water, and sometimes a little
Pottage with Fruits or Herbs: His Apparel
is sufficient only to defend him against the
Weather. Besides, he is instructed in the
Mahometan Religion. In this Ignorance of
Delights, far from the Blandishment of his
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:52279:208"/>
own Relations, he grows up into a robust and
sturdy Fellow. This Man is again demanded
of his Fiduciary Master and transferred to the
Wars; and from this Seminary, the Legions
of the Janizaries, when they are defective,
are made up: When he comes to be listed
among the Janizaries, his Pay at first is
about one Ducat and a Half <hi>per mensem,</hi> for
that they think is enough for a Fresh-water
Soldier. And yet that he may not want Food,
he hath his Meat <hi>gratis</hi> with that Company,
into whose Chamber he is admitted; but upon
this Condition, that he serves them in the
Kitchen and other necessary Offices. The
Skillfulness of that Chamber instructs him in
the use of Arms, and fits him for Service;
and when this Tyro hath gotten a little Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in Military Affairs, though not equal
with his Fellows, is only hoped to mount
higher by his Valour; and if he carries him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
bravely in any Service, then his Pay is
increas'd, and is reckon'd a compleat Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zary.
This hope does excite such Youngsters
to many valiant Attempts, so that they equal
the very <hi>Veterans</hi> in Valour, and obtain the full
Pay of Janizaries, which at the highest is but
eight Ducats a Month; and yet if his Valour
or Desert call him up to a higher Place, either
he is made a Commander amongst the Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries,
or is listed among the Pretorian Horse
called <hi>Spahies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The rest of the Youths before spoken of,
are imploy'd in several Works at <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
               <pb n="402" facs="tcp:52279:209"/>
sometimes two or three hundred of
them Cleanse the Court-Yards, removes
Rubbish, carry Stones, Timber, and other
Burdens: not One of them is idle, but must
Earn the Bread he eats. These Youths also
when they are grown up to Transfer to
Land or Sea-Service, and those of them that
are Chosen for the Court, do many times
mount to great Dignities: For the General
of the <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> Admirals of Fleets, <hi>Beglar
Begs,</hi> and the <hi>Viziers Bassa's</hi> themselves are
Elected out of these; yea, the Daughters
of <hi>Sultans</hi> are given in Marriage to them.</p>
            <p>Thus have I given you a Plain Account,
what is the Rise, Choice, Discipline, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation
of the <hi>Turkish Soldiery,</hi> so formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
all the World Over: I deny not, but
there are other ways of Military Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
amonst them, but this is the most
usual; sometimes they make Soldiers of those
Youths whom they have taken in War, or
by frequent Incursions into <hi>Christian Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi>
after they have detain'd them for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
years in the <hi>Seraglio:</hi> and when they
have lost all Memory and Sence of their own
Country, and the Religion thereof, and
have been Instructed in <hi>Arabick,</hi> and in the
<hi>Turkish</hi> way of Arms, by their <hi>Eunuch-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi>
then they send them abroad to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the Military Service they are most fit
for. Moreover the Slaves of the <hi>Bassa's,</hi> and
other Nobles got by War, or otherwise, are
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:52279:209"/>
many times listed Soldiers; but not rashly,
or hand over head; but having first tryed
their Strength and Valour both of Body and
Mind, to obtain the Station they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
for. And the truth is, I have often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
admir'd the Force of the <hi>Turkish Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi>
in this case, when I saw seemingly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
and contemptible Persons in a few years,
to have made that Advance, as not only to
be able to perform the Duty of a common
Soldier, But even of a Commander also, fit
to Teach and Instruct others.</p>
            <p>Sometimes when for my own Refreshment,
I look'd out at my Windows, the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<hi>Turks</hi> shewed me some Officers that
were Teaching the young Fry the Use of
Arms: I demanded of what Country they
were? I verily thought, they must be either
<hi>Parthians, Bactrians,</hi> or <hi>Massagets;</hi> but when
I was told that one was an <hi>Hungarian,</hi> the
other a <hi>Croat,</hi> a third a <hi>German;</hi> I was struck
with Admiration; But supposing they had
obtain'd their Skill at Arms, from the Use of
them amongst <hi>Christians,</hi> and supposing them
to be Noble Persons and Gentilely Bred; I
proceeded to demand, Whether they knew
what kind of Life they lived amongst <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians?</hi>
After a little Recollection, they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
me, <hi>That one had told them his Father
was a</hi> Cook, <hi>another was intimated a</hi> Monk,
<hi>and the third was Servant to a</hi> Victualler; <hi>but
being taken in a time of War of Truce, with other
Booty, they were brought to</hi> Constantinople,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:52279:210"/>
               <hi>and admitted into the Family of this or that</hi> Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa.
Here I was struck again with Wonder!
And demanding, How such kind of Fellows
could come to be so great Warriors? They
told me, <hi>The Masters they served, had certain
Men at their Houses well skill'd in Arms, to
whose Discipline (if they were thought Tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
they were Consign'd over, where they so
much profited in a little Time, that they Surpassed
their Equals, and had performed so bravely in
succeeding Wars, that they obtained Praise from
all, and Dignity from their Prince, as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of their Valour.</hi> When I heard this, I
was much aggrieved that our Manners should
so differ from the <hi>Turks;</hi> for if they have got
a Man that promises any thing, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in him, as a precious Treasure, and
spare no Pains or Cost in his Cultivation,
especially if he be fit for the War. But alas,
'tis quite contrary among us; if we have but
a good Dog, a Hawk, or a Horse, we are
over-joyed, and spare no Pains to bring him
to Perfection in his kind: But if we have
got an Ingenious Man into our Hands, we
don't take so much Pains in his Institution:
For our parts we take delight in well Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd
Dogs and Hawks; but the <hi>Turks</hi> take
a greater in the Culture of Man, who is
more Excellent in his Nature than a Beast.</p>
            <p>From what hath been spoken, it is Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
That 'tis no new thing to List Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
Judiciously the way that I contend for;
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:52279:210"/>
'twas used both by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and by both
Conquering Nations: Neither is it so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solete
or so remote from the Custom of our
Age, as it may not be again call'd back into
Use: For we find by daily Experience, how
the <hi>Turkish Arms</hi> so Cultivated do prevail.
Let it not therefore seem i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ksom to us to
borrow this necessary Part from them who
have borrow'd so many useful Things from
Us: If we thus do, we shall quickly find a
good Discipline will avail as much for our
Safety, as a bad hath hitherto contributed
to our Ruine. This is the only Anchor
left in a dangerous Tempest, to preserve
the floating Ship of our <hi>Commonwealth;</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Thing is establish'd and preserv'd by that
which rais'd it at first; as Kingdoms and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires
have been obtain'd by Military Valour,
and well-appointed Armies, by the same
way they must be preserv'd. Take away
Arms, remove Soldiers, neglect Discipline,
and a Kingdom will either fall of it self, or
be a Prey to the Conqueror. The Diadem
and Scepter doth not preserve the Majesty
of a Kingdom, as the Sword; in vain you
wear the one upon your Head, or carry the
other in your Hand, unless your Sword be
girt by your Side: That Empire is but Weak
and Maim'd, that is not supported by Arms:
When I speak of Arms, I mean not shadowy
glittering Ones, but true solid and viceless
Ones.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="406" facs="tcp:52279:211"/>That which is Corrupted and Degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from its Perfection, doth more hurt
than good: As long as the <hi>Romans</hi> kept up
their strict Military Discipline, their Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
Conquer'd the remotest Parts of the
World; but after Discipline came to be
Corrupted, and their Valour Effeminated,
by neglecting old Institutions; they not only
lost the greatest part of the Empire, but
<hi>Rome</hi> it self was not free from Plunder with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
its own Walls; So that the City <hi>Erst,</hi> the
Head and Prince of all Nations, was now
expos'd as a Prey and Laughing-stock to them
all, who pluck'd away their Spoils from her,
as the rest of the Birds did their Feathers
from <hi>Aesop</hi>'s Chough.</p>
            <p>But our Circumstances are the more pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
because the deadly Wound doth threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
our own almost naked Bowels; and there
is no way but this left to secure our Lives.
Sometimes Rulers when new Dangers threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
them, are fain to apply Remedies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
to the <hi>Genius</hi> of their Subjects, and
thereupon to warp sometimes from the
Rule of Right: But our Straits are such,
that when the Ruine of our Country is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Eyes, we must immediately use
those Means which may prevent our Ruine;
if our Enemy were afar off, then we may
send for raw Soldiers from far Countries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from Enemies; but we who are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
cast of Dart, and ready to Fight Hand to
Hand, must commit our Safety to no Arms
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:52279:211"/>
but those that are tryed and approved
Ones.</p>
            <p>But some may o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ject, That this our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Preparation will be too slender to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Torrent of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Force.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I answer;</hi> I here only shew, how the solid
Foundation of a constant Army may be laid,
the rest of the Building will follow of course,
and Auxiliaries being added, will soon make
up a great Army; and such Auxiliaries will
speedily come in, when it shall be reported,
that we have already a Body of an Army to
which they may resort; for Nature it self
will prompt them to assist those who are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to undergo all Dangers with themselves:
And on the other Hand, it doth alienate
from those who are unarm'd and unfit to
resist offer'd Wrongs.</p>
            <p>Hence <hi>Zenophon</hi> says very excellently, <hi>That
those who are ready with Arms in their Hands,
have many Friends, and no Enemies; for all
will fly to their Aid in doubtful Times, as to a
Castle of Refuge, and none will oppose him, when
he knows he has power enough to hurt his Enemy
when he please.</hi> Hence it comes to pass that
whilst we loiter and slacken our Endeavours,
as despairing of our Safety, and depend only
upon our Hope and Aid from Others; even
our very Friends and Relations will despise
them, and forsake them, and will rather
joyn with the bold daring Enemy, though
of another Religion. So great is the force
of expeditious Arms. In the Name there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:52279:212"/>
of God Almighty, let us buckle on the
Helmet, and with Arms in our Hand, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
so great an Enemy. We our selves
should be first Initiated in the Religion of
Armed <hi>Palas,</hi> we should devote our selves
to her Studies; put our Hands first to the
P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow, and do our Duty; God will supply
all the rest, and Aid will not be wanting to
those who are Voic'd not to be wanting to
themselves. Let us not rest till we have got
at least Twelve Thousand Foot together;
(of the Horse, I will speak in another place)
besides ordinary Garrisons, and those Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
out of our own Country, well Trained
and Exercised. When this our Practice
shall be made known, not our Friends only,
but even Strangers will send us in; on Hope
for Aid: And if those Hopes should fail, yet
our own small force being in Garrison in
Summer-time, may suppress the Force of
the Enemy; and in Winter we may make
such Inroads upon their Borders, that they
would repent their provoking of us: And
by this means they would be forced to seek
for Truce from us, which we can hardly
now by Petition obtain from them; and they
will also observe the Conditions more strictly,
than now they do; but as our present Case
stands, we are tossed with every VVind: If
our Garrisons be in danger, and some sudden
Assault requires speedy Aid, we have no
Force at all, either to help our Own, or to
stop the Current of our Enemies Successes;
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:52279:212"/>
I grant that these things require our singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ar
Care and Study; neither can we place
our Thoughts and our Delights on a fitter
Subject; no Field of Praise lyes more open
to us than that wherein we Exercise our
Troops every Day, and advance them for
Military Exploits. Let others please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with Gilded Houses, and some with
Pleasant Cardens; Others with Ornamental
and Gaudy Houshould-stuff, as Pictures, and
the like, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but let all our delight be in these
VVarlike Preparations, even in time of Peace:
Let us value our Selves to our Friends upon
this account only; for what can be more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teful
to any Guest of ours, than to see a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Choice Youths shining in their Arms;
of strong and nimble Bodies, Exercising
themselves with Guns, Spears, or Swords;
nimbly turning their Bodies at the Beck of
their Commanders, and by the Chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their Countenance woing an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to Fight withal. Such sorts of Youth
<hi>videlicet,</hi> The <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> the <hi>Turkish Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors</hi>
call their Sons, as the Hope and
Foundation of their <hi>Empire. Philopemen</hi> the
last <hi>Emperor</hi> of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> when he saw the
VVarlike Glory of his Country to decline,
and to be ready to give up the Ghost out of
Cowardise and Neglect of Military Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline;
and as a Lover of his Country, being
willing to prevent its Ruine, he got a brave
Train of <hi>Grecian Noble Youths</hi> about him,
which he Instructed in the Art of VVar; and
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:52279:213"/>
coming once with this Train in his Military
Habit, into a Theatre of <hi>Greece,</hi> full of Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators,
he was mightily H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>zza'd and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by the whole Assembly; for they
were sensible of the Merit of such a Citizen
who was willing to Retrieve the Glory of
his Country, and to Excite the Youth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to valiant Feats of Arms. And why may
not we <hi>Christians</hi> get the same Applause, and
do that which is acceptable both to God and
Man, if we undertake the declining Cause
of our common Safety, and vindicate our
Military Praise to its ancient Dignity.</p>
            <p>But I shall put an end to this Discourse,
when I shall have told you the Grounds
thereof; when I have Admonish'd and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
<hi>Christians</hi> to shake off that drousie Fit
under which they lye, and so run in to the
Help of a decaying <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> The Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
is as great as ever was; let us then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stir
our selves to maintain those Seats with
that Credit which our Ancestors have got for
us, and deliver them down to our Posterity;
and the only way so to do, is this, To Repel
Force with Force, to run to our Arms, and
that not fortuitous, tumultuous, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Ones, but our own Country Ones, List<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Trained up with great Judgment, and
choice Reasons. We should herein imitate
valiant Soldiers, who when they are Besieged
in a weak Fort, and are ready to fall into
the Hands of a cruel Enemy, they stir up all
their Strength, and do their very utmost to
preserve themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="411" facs="tcp:52279:213"/>But if we be otherwse minded, and
through Cowardise or mistake, be wanting
to the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> or our selves, there
are but these two ways left, either we must
leave our own Country and Hereditary Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions,
as a Prey to the Conqueror, or else
we must dye, or be made Slaves; (Of the
Two, if we be so degenerate) let us rather
leave our Habitatations, our Lands, Goods,
and Houses, than suffer our very Blood to
be suck'd, the Chastity of our Wives and
Children to be expos'd, or those Indignities
suffer'd with so many People of <hi>Asia, Africa,</hi>
and <hi>Europe,</hi> from the furthest <hi>Eastern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi>
even to our Borders do undergo: If we
walk in their Steps, we may, fear the same
Ruine.</p>
            <p>But why, pray, should we Transplant our
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ves, let's rather Fight it out, and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
buckle to those ways of Defence which
God has mercifully supply'd us with. To our
Arms, to our Arms, with Valor and Courage,
our only Hope under God. This becomes
the <hi>Christian Name,</hi> and the greatness of the
Danger we are in, and this may prevent our
impending Ruine.</p>

and establish'd by <hi>Imperial Oaths,</hi> and by these
<hi>Letters of Credence,</hi> as if we Our Selves had
been present. And therefore I send these <hi>Letters
of Peace</hi> to you, that your <hi>Commanders</hi> and <hi>Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers</hi>
may be bound to Observe them, as long as they
shall not Act contrary thereunto; so long these <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Peace</hi> be Confirm'd between us. <hi>In Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
whereof,</hi> I Swear by the True and
Living <hi>Creator</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth;</hi> by the
true Signs of our Great and Venerable <hi>Prophet,</hi> by
my <hi>Imperial Power,</hi> and by my <hi>True Faith,</hi> that
none of my <hi>Captains, Commanders, &amp;c.</hi> shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume,
or attempt to do any thing in Breach of this
Eight Years Truce; Commanding also all the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats
of our <hi>Potent Emperor,</hi> the <hi>Rulers</hi> of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lakia</hi>
and <hi>Moldavia,</hi> and <hi>King Stephen</hi> himself,
with other <hi>Commanders</hi> on our Borders, that they
observe these <hi>Conditions</hi> towards your <hi>People,
Cities, &amp;c.</hi> as I my self will do: Nor that they
commit the least Breach, to the Prejudice of
any of your <hi>Subjects.</hi> In short, I shall Ascribe
great Reverence and Authority to this Great and
Potent <hi>Friendship;</hi> so that I will not vary a jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Release all the <hi>Turks</hi> that are Prisoners with you.
