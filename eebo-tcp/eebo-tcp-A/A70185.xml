            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may perhaps ſeem to ſome incongruous, that my <hi>Reply</hi> is not written in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the <hi>Objections;</hi> and I ſhould have thought ſo too, had the <hi>Objections</hi> ſpoke the Language of my <hi>Diſcourſe.</hi> But ſince my Aſſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant takes the Liberty to recede from <hi>my</hi> Style, I know no reaſon obligeth me to humour <hi>his.</hi> And 'tis leſs improper for a Book to differ in faſhion from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that oppoſeth it; than from <hi>that</hi> of which 'tis a part and vindication. And this Anſwer were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the ſeeming <hi>impropriety:</hi> But yet I have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons more conſiderable to excuſe it. I muſt confeſs then, that by that time <hi>Sciri</hi> was extant, I was grown ſo indifferent to thoſe matters, that I had
<pb facs="tcp:49777:3"/>
much ado to perſwade my ſelf to a Review of what I had written; and could have ben content to have left <hi>it</hi> without any other <hi>vindication,</hi> then what it could it ſelf obtain from the <hi>good nature</hi> and <hi>ingenuity,</hi> of <hi>impartial</hi> peruſers. And in this coldneſs of humor had without doubt deſerved <hi>it,</hi> but that my Bookſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler importun'd me for another <hi>Edition:</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of his having conſented to, I ſaw my ſelf under a neceſſity of <hi>decorum</hi> to return ſomething on an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, in which <hi>ſilence</hi> perhaps might have been <hi>ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manners</hi> to an ingenious and learned Adverſary. But though the conſtraint of theſe circumſtances over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came my averſneſs to writing any more on a ſubject, with which I thought I had done for ever; yet could it not prevail againſt the humour I had of troubling my ſelf no more then needs in a buſineſs, to which I was <hi>driven,</hi> rather then <hi>inclined</hi> or <hi>perſwaded.</hi> So that after I had reſolv'd an <hi>Anſwer;</hi> it had been more difficult to have drawn my ſelf to put it into any other <hi>drſs,</hi> then what is moſt <hi>eaſie</hi> and <hi>familiar.</hi> Which yet was not the effect only of the <hi>indiſpoſition</hi> and <hi>lazineſs</hi> of my humour; but a dictate of my diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For the truth is, I foreſaw the occaſion would not engage me in any thing, that I could think worthy of the <hi>univerſal Language;</hi> except I ſhould have written a <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> and not an <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Beſides which, had I uſed another <hi>ſtyle</hi> I muſt have been more diffuſe in reiterating what I had ſaid in the

Yet even in that, when I would look deep, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern objections which perhaps will very difficulty be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied: And which ſpeak thoſe ingenious offers to be but <hi>attempts,</hi> no abſolute <hi>performances.</hi> And if this acute Philoſopher think the <hi>impulſe</hi> of the <hi>external Winds</hi> a ſufficient cauſe of the <hi>Flux</hi> and <hi>Reflux;</hi> I ſhall not go about to diſturbe him in his ſatisfactions. <hi>That will eaſe one Man's mind, that will leave an others reſtleſs.</hi> Only I cannot well apprehend how ſo <hi>conſtant</hi> and <hi>regular</hi> an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as the <hi>motion</hi> of the <hi>Sea,</hi> ſhould depend upon ſo <hi>uncertain</hi> and <hi>proverbially inconſtant</hi> a cauſe as the winds are. Or, if there were no difficulty in <hi>that,</hi> yet the learned Author may pleaſe to conſider, that this is but the next cauſe of the <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> the cauſe of which, perhaps, is more hardly aſſigneable then the other. And the nature and original of the winds, is, it may be, as abſtruſe a Theory as any in Philoſophy. For in aſſigning Cauſes, in the <hi>ſecond</hi> or <hi>third,</hi> commonly we are loſt and non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſt, which is no inconſiderable evidence of humane <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> and <hi>Deficiency.</hi>

And I need no teſtimonies in ſo clear a buſineſs.

               <p n="5">(5) Then, That noble and celebrated friend of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, affirmes in his <hi>Immortality</hi> [that the <hi>ſoul is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and a ſubſtance beſides the body.]</hi> Yea, almoſt all that diſcourſe of his leans upon that ſuppoſal. Yea</p>
               <p n="6">(6) Our Philoſopher himſelf in his <hi>Peripatetical Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,</hi> affirms as much as ever I ſuppoſed. For he ſaith that ['Tis moſt evident that the <hi>mind</hi> is ſomething of an other kind from <hi>Quantity</hi> and <hi>Matter,</hi> that 'tis noble and wholy oppoſite to the nature of <hi>Quantity,</hi> that 'tis a <hi>ſubſtantial Principle</hi> of Man, and no <hi>mode</hi> or <hi>determination</hi> of <hi>diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi> and that there is nothing common to <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Spirit.]</hi> Beſides which, in the Fifth Book of the ſame <hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> he diſcourſes of the Souls <hi>ſeparation</hi> from the <hi>body,</hi> and aſſerts it to be evident, that it periſheth not with it; becauſe it hath actions that belong not to a <hi>body,</hi> but hath of it ſelf the vertue of a <hi>being.</hi> And that it's power of exiſtence is not taken away when the body fails, the ſoul being apart from
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49777:14"/>
and beſides it. And that <hi>matter</hi> is not neceſſary to the <hi>Souls exiſtence.</hi> Many other expreſſions there are in that diſcourſe to like purpoſe, which ſeem to ſpeak the <hi>Souls real diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the Body</hi> in as great variety of phraſe as <hi>diverſity</hi> and <hi>diſtinction</hi> can be ſpoken. So that how ſuch paſſages conſiſt with the doctrine of it's <hi>Identity</hi> with the <hi>body,</hi> I confeſs I am not <hi>Metaphyſical</hi> enough to comprehend. And I believe very few elſe can perceive the conſiſtency beſides this Philoſopher; whoſe <hi>Metaphyſicks</hi> of <hi>whole</hi> and <hi>part,</hi> have yet been entertain'd by none that I know of; and therefore though this ſhould be acknowledged a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, yet 'tis an Argument of the weakneſs of humane un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that it hath not yet comprehended it.</p>
               <p>I think by this time 'tis clear then, that the ſuppoſition of my procedure, the <hi>Souls diſtinction from the Body,</hi> is not peccant; except all the world, both <hi>Antient</hi> and <hi>Modern,</hi> hath been miſtaken, and our Author alſo: which if it be granted, 'tis an inſtance of what I plead for. If not, my ſuppoſition is good, and the emergent doubt unanſwer'd. And if our learned Author yet thinks it plain, that <hi>either Man is no being,</hi> or that the <hi>ſoul and body are not two,</hi> I muſt acknowledge ſuch <hi>Palams</hi> to be the <hi>Dogmatizing</hi> I ſuppoſe. And I am willing to put it upon the iſſue, whether it be ſo to any body elſe but this Philoſopher.</p>
               <p>But (2) beſides all this, it ſeems to me very clear from the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>Things</hi> themſelves abſtracting from <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;</hi> That the <hi>Soul</hi> is <hi>a ſubſtance diſtinct from the body.</hi> For I think,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) 'Tis ſtrongly concluded by the common Arguments that prove it <hi>immaterial;</hi> for <hi>perception,</hi> perception of <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals, univerſals</hi> and other <hi>abſtracts</hi> from ſenſe, as <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical lines, points, ſuperficies, congenit notions, Logical, Metaphyſical,</hi> and <hi>Moral<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſelf-reflection, Freedom, indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> and <hi>univerſality</hi> of <hi>action:</hi> theſe, I ſay, are properties not at all competible to <hi>body</hi> or <hi>matter,</hi> though of never ſo pure
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49777:14"/>
a mixture. Nor is it conceiveable how any of theſe ſhould ariſe from <hi>modificaiions</hi> of <hi>quantity</hi> being of a diverſe kind from all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of <hi>motion</hi> But</p>
               <p n="2">(2) If the ſoul be not a diſtinct ſubſtance from the body, 'tis then a certain <hi>diſpoſition</hi> and <hi>modification</hi> of <hi>it;</hi> which this Gentteman in the 10 Leſſon of his <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> ſeems to intimate, ſaying, <hi>[That ſince the ſoul is a certain affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>—which is introduced and expell'd by corporeal acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on—] he thence inferrs ſome thing that is not to our purpoſe to relate. And if ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſince all <hi>diverſities</hi> in <hi>matter</hi> ariſe from <hi>motion</hi> and <hi>poſition</hi> of <hi>parts,</hi> every different preception will require a different <hi>order</hi> and <hi>poſition</hi> of the parts of the <hi>matter perceiving,</hi> which muſt be obtained by motion. I demand then, when we paſs from one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to another, is the motion, the cauſe of this diverſity, meerly <hi>caſual;</hi> or directed by ſome act of knowledge? The former, I ſuppoſe, no Man in his wits will affirm; ſince then all our conceptions will be non-ſenſe and confuſion; <hi>chance</hi> being the cauſe of nothing that is <hi>orderly</hi> and <hi>regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</hi> If therefore there be a knowledge in us that directs the motions that form every diſtinct conception: I demand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that <hi>knowledge,</hi> Whether it be in like manner di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by ſome other, or is it the effect of meer <hi>caſual</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? If the former, we muſt run up in <hi>infinitum</hi> in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry: and the latter admits the alledged abſurdities. There is no way then of defending the aſſertion of the ſouls being <hi>matter,</hi> or any <hi>modification</hi> of it: but by affirming with Maſter <hi>Hobbs</hi> a <hi>certain connexion</hi> between all our <hi>thoughts,</hi> and a neceſſary <hi>fate</hi> in all things: which who ever affirmes, will find difficulties enough in his aſſertion to bring him to mine, That there's a <hi>Vanity</hi> in <hi>Dogmatizing,</hi> and <hi>Confidence</hi> is unreaſonable.</p>
               <p>But of this I have had occaſion to diſcourſe more in an other Treatiſe, and I ſhall not repeat what I have there written, or what others have ſaid on the ſubject. Eſpecially
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49777:15"/>
ſince perhaps this learned Gentleman will not think himſelf concern'd in the Proof of this Concluſion, he having in his writings aſſerted it. But whether he have not unſaid it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in <hi>this,</hi> I appeal to any equal Decerner. And that the <hi>ſoul</hi> ſhould be a <hi>ſubſtance of another kind from mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> that <hi>hath nothing common with it; a ſubſtance ſeparable from all body, to which matter is not neceſſary, and actually in the other ſtate divided from it:</hi> (all which and more to like purpoſe our Author hath in ſome of his Books af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed;) and yet not be a <hi>diſtinct ſubſtance,</hi> but <hi>really</hi> the ſame with the <hi>body</hi> to which it is united; which he <hi>aſſerts</hi> in <hi>this;</hi> I ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how theſe ſo oppoſite affirmations can be reconciled, I have either not wit, or not charity enough to help me to imagine. I know this Authors doctrine is, that there are no parts before <hi>ſeparation</hi> and <hi>diviſion,</hi> and therefore no <hi>real diſtinction.</hi> But whether things in their natures ſo <hi>divers</hi> as <hi>body</hi> and <hi>ſpirit,</hi> which almoſt in nothing, even according to this Philoſophy, communicate; are not <hi>eſſentially</hi> divided, though not <hi>locally</hi> diſtant, I am willing to leave to the Readers judgment. And I would fain know whereupon the <hi>ſeparability</hi> of the <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>body</hi> is founded, if not upon the <hi>real diſtinction</hi> of their natures: ſo that though this notion may be leſs obnoxious when it relates only to <hi>ſubſtances</hi> of the ſame <hi>kind,</hi> and quality; yet when it concerns thoſe that are ſo <hi>eſſentially</hi> diſtinct, as <hi>body</hi> and <hi>ſpirit,</hi> it ſeems moſt ſtrangely lyable. Yea though it ſhould be ſuppoſed a Truth, yet it muſt be acknowledged unconceiveable; which ſufficeth to ſatisfie my Concluſion.</p>

For either by <hi>Homo quatenus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectivus,</hi> our Author means ſomething that is the <hi>ſame</hi> with the body; or really <hi>diſtinct</hi> and diverſe. If the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, he hath not ſatisfied the Authority of the <hi>Church,</hi> which affirms, the Soul as a <hi>diſtinct</hi> ſubſtance, to be the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſubject of <hi>Creation;</hi> founded upon that clear diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the inſpired writings [The body to the duſt, and the Soul to God that gave it.] But if he mean the latter, he hath not provided for his own aſſertion and <hi>hypotheſis.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides (2.)

And the latter overthrows all our Author's Anſwers, with the Propoſition upon which they are erected. For if there be ſome thing in man which is the ſubject of <hi>divine power</hi> and <hi>action;</hi> and ſome other thing that is the ſubject of <hi>natural production</hi> and <hi>generation;</hi> it ſeems to me appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that theſe muſt be two things really diſtinguiſh't.

power: whereas all <hi>generation,</hi> according to truth and the ſame Hypotheſis, at leaſt ſuppoſeth one of them, and is perform'd by natural agents. And I think the caſe is plain enough when 'tis brought to this, Whether the ſame thing can be produced of <hi>ſomething</hi> and <hi>nothing,</hi> with created aſſiſtance, and without it? Since the <hi>Actions</hi> then are ſo <hi>infinitely diverſe,</hi> I think I ſhall not be reprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <hi>Dogmatical,</hi> in affirming the terms <hi>diſtinct.</hi> What the Gentleman ſays more, ſeems to be involv'd, and looks like a deſigned evaſion. And if <hi>[one action</hi> produceth a man, a Creature equivalent to a <hi>Beaſt</hi> and <hi>Angel]</hi> I demand, Whether this one action be <hi>divine</hi> or <hi>natural,</hi> from <hi>God</hi> or the <hi>generant?</hi> If the former, every <hi>man</hi> is as <hi>immediately created</hi> as the <hi>firſt.</hi> And the latter quite excludes <hi>crea ion,</hi> and ſuppoſeth God no otherwiſe to <hi>act</hi> in giving being to our Souls, then in each common production. 'Tis neceſſary therefore that the terms produced be <hi>diſtinct,</hi> when the Actions whereby they are produced are ſo vaſtly <hi>diverſe;</hi> and that the Soul have an Origination different from the <hi>Formation</hi> of the <hi>body,</hi> of which 'tis more <hi>pertinent</hi> to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,</hi> then <hi>eaſie</hi> to return an <hi>Anſwer.</hi>

To this I rejoyn briefly, (1) what the Gentleman himſelf ſuggeſts, were <hi>anſwer</hi> ſufficient, that the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of difficulty doth not ſolve <hi>it:</hi> For ſuppoſing the <hi>direction</hi> of the <hi>corpuſcles</hi> of <hi>light,</hi> and thoſe mention'd <hi>Effluvia,</hi> to be of a difficult apprehenſion, as the <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance</hi> and <hi>regularity</hi> of thoſe <hi>images</hi> in the Brain: yet this only argues another <hi>defect</hi> in our <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and ſo is a new evidence of the <hi>truth</hi> of my General <hi>Concluſion.</hi> But (2) the propoſed Inſtances are far more accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then <hi>this</hi> before us. For, as to what concerns the <hi>light,</hi> ſuppoſing with <hi>Des Cartes</hi> (as is moſt probable) that the action of <hi>Light</hi> conſiſts in nothing but the <hi>conamen</hi> of the <hi>Aethereal matter,</hi> receding from the <hi>centre</hi> of its <hi>motion:</hi> The <hi>direct tendency</hi> of it to the Eye, is no difficulty worth conſidering, but as <hi>clear</hi> as the <hi>Light</hi> it ſelf the ſubject of the enquiry; or, if the <hi>rays</hi> be <hi>Atomical ſtreams,</hi> and <hi>effluxes</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> there is no more difficulty in this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> neither, then in the direct <hi>ſpouting</hi> of <hi>water</hi> out of a <hi>Pipe;</hi> yea no more, then in the beating of the <hi>waves</hi> againſt the ſides of a <hi>Ship,</hi> when it ſwims in the <hi>Ocean.</hi> For there's an whole <hi>Sea</hi> of <hi>Atomes</hi> which derive from the <hi>Fountain illuminant,</hi> whoſe courſe can no more be diverted, by thoſe little bodies that ſwim up and down in the air; then that of the <hi>Ocean</hi> can by thoſe <hi>Sands, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Fiſhes,</hi> and <hi>Rocks,</hi> that are mingled with the waters. And as for the other Inſtances of <hi>corporeal Emiſſions,</hi> it would require to be prov'd that they perform all thoſe

feats that are aſcrib'd to them: whereas perhaps it is more likely, that thoſe ſtrange operations are not <hi>Mechanical</hi> but <hi>Magical,</hi> being effected by the <hi>continuity</hi> of the great <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> which runs through all things: or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to ſuppoſe this act of the <hi>Memory</hi> to be as clear as <hi>Magnetiſme</hi> and <hi>Sympathies,</hi> will be no great advantage to the belief of its <hi>certain Intelligibility.</hi>

                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:49777:25"/>
For the firſt then, That there are <hi>Actual parts</hi> in <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,</hi> I evince it by theſe conſiderations. (1.) The formal nature of <hi>Quantity</hi> is <hi>Extenſion</hi> in the notion of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Schools; and <hi>Diviſibility</hi> in the <hi>Philoſophy</hi> of Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby,</hi> and our <hi>Authour;</hi> Both which ſuppoſe <hi>parts,</hi> and <hi>parts actual:</hi> for to be <hi>extended,</hi> in the <hi>School phraſe,</hi> is to have <hi>partes extrapartes;</hi> and if the <hi>extenſion</hi> be <hi>actual,</hi> the <hi>parts</hi> muſt be <hi>ſo:</hi> for it is not conceiveable how a thing can be <hi>extended,</hi> but by <hi>parts</hi> which are <hi>really diſtinct</hi> one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, though not <hi>ſeparate:</hi> which ſeems to me ſo evident, that nothing can be ſpoken plainer; and I appeal in this matter to the common ſenſe of all men. Nor can a thing be <hi>divided,</hi> except we ſuppoſe the <hi>parts praeexiſtent</hi> in the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible:</hi> for <hi>diviſibility</hi> is founded upon <hi>real diſtinction,</hi> and 'tis impoſſible to <hi>divide</hi> what is <hi>one</hi> without <hi>diverſity.</hi> (2.) Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept there are <hi>parts</hi> in <hi>quantity</hi> before <hi>diviſion,</hi> there are <hi>none</hi> at all: for after they are divided they are no <hi>parts,</hi> but have a <hi>compleatneſs</hi> and <hi>integrality</hi> of their own, eſpecially if the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject were <hi>homogeneous.</hi> (3.) Except there are <hi>parts actually</hi> in <hi>quantity, contradictions</hi> may be verified <hi>de eodem,</hi> with all the other circumſtances, which the <hi>Metaphyſicks</hi> teach <hi>impoſsible.</hi> For the ſame body may be <hi>black</hi> and <hi>white, cold</hi> and <hi>hot, ſeen</hi> and not <hi>ſeen,</hi> and partake of all other moſt contrary qualities. Which contradictions, and inconſiſtences cannot be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated in the ſame ſubject, without ſuppoſal of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended-for <hi>diverſity.</hi> Nor will the anſwer, which Sir <hi>K. Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> has provided for ſuch <hi>Objections</hi> help the <hi>Hypotheſis, viz.</hi> [that it is not <hi>one part</hi> of the thing that ſhews it ſelf, and <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> that doth not, one that is <hi>hot,</hi> and another <hi>cold,</hi> &amp;c. But it is the ſame thing, ſhewing it ſelf according to one <hi>poſsibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of <hi>diviſion,</hi> and not another.] For firſt, theſe <hi>diſtinct poſsibilities</hi> are founded upon <hi>diſtinct actualities,</hi> which are the parts I would have acknowledged. And ſuch a capacity of receiving things ſo different, cannot be in the ſame ſubject, without the ſuppoſal of <hi>parts actually diſtinct</hi> and <hi>divers.</hi>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:49777:25"/>
(2.) The <hi>ſubjects</hi> of theſe <hi>contrary</hi> qualities are things <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al:</hi> whereas <hi>poſsibilities</hi> are but <hi>Metaphyſical notions.</hi> And theſe ſubjects are <hi>diſtinct,</hi> or <hi>contradictions</hi> will be reconcil'd <hi>de eodem;</hi> from which the inference ſeems neceſſary, that <hi>quantity</hi> hath <hi>parts,</hi> and <hi>parts actual,</hi> and <hi>diſtinct poſsibilities</hi> will not ſalve the buſineſs. And (3.) why muſt the common ſpeech of all mankinde be alter'd, and what all the world cals <hi>parts,</hi> be call'd <hi>poſsibilities</hi> of <hi>diviſion?</hi> which yet if our Philoſopher will needs name <hi>ſo,</hi> they being acknowledg'd <hi>diſtinct,</hi> and prov'd <hi>actual,</hi> or at leaſt founded immediately upon things that are <hi>ſo;</hi> my queſtion will as well proceed this way as in the common one, <hi>viz.</hi> How the things that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to theſe <hi>diſtinct poſsibilities</hi> are <hi>united,</hi> and of what <hi>compounded?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is another Anſwer which I find in our Authors <hi>Peripatetical Inſtitutions,</hi> the ſum of which is, [That the <hi>contradictions</hi> have only a <hi>notional</hi> repugnance in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as 'tis in our underſtandings: and ſince the parts have a diſtinct being in our underſtanding, from thence 'tis that they are capable to ſuſtain contradictions] which Anſwer, if I underſtand, I have reaſon to wonder at: for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Subject</hi> ſuſtains the <hi>Contradictories</hi> as it is in <hi>re.</hi> And, I never heard of a notion <hi>black</hi> or <hi>white,</hi> but in a Metaphor; 'tis the <hi>real</hi> ſubſtance is the ſubject of theſe <hi>contrarieties;</hi> which were impoſſible, if it had not <hi>divers realities</hi> anſwering to the <hi>qualities</hi> ſo <hi>denominating.</hi> And therefore 'tis not the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> that makes the <hi>divers ſubjects</hi> of theſe <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,</hi> as our Author ſuggeſts: but there <hi>being ſuch</hi> is the ground that we <hi>ſo</hi> apprehend them. I hope I need ſay no more then to eſtabliſh the ſuppoſal of the difficulty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration, That there are <hi>parts actually</hi> in <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity:</hi> only I am obliged by my propoſed method to add further,</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) That the grounds of the excellent Sir <hi>K. Digby,</hi> and our Author, on which they built their aſſerted <hi>Paradox,</hi>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:49777:26"/>
ſeem to me very inſufficient to ſuſtain ſo great a weight as leans upon them. The Reaſons are (1.) <hi>Quantity</hi> is <hi>Diviſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> (2.) <hi>Diviſibility</hi> is <hi>capacity</hi> of <hi>Diviſion.</hi> (3) What is only <hi>capable</hi> of <hi>diviſion,</hi> is not <hi>actually divided.</hi> (4.) Quantity is not <hi>actually divided,</hi> and therefore hath no <hi>parts actually,</hi> To which in ſhort,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) That <hi>Quantity</hi> is <hi>Diviſibility,</hi> is <hi>preſumed;</hi> but <hi>extenſion</hi> is before it, in <hi>nature,</hi> and our <hi>conception,</hi> and is the received notion, though perhaps <hi>Impenetrability</hi> is the trueſt. However (2.) even <hi>this</hi> ſuppoſeth <hi>parts,</hi> and thoſe <hi>actual:</hi> For <hi>Diviſion</hi> is but <hi>Solution</hi> of <hi>Union.</hi> And <hi>Union</hi> ſuppoſeth <hi>Parts</hi> to be <hi>united.</hi> (3.) What is only capable of diviſion in a <hi>Phyſiological</hi> and <hi>Mechanical</hi> lenſe; may, yea and ought, to be <hi>divided</hi> in a <hi>Metaphyſical.</hi> That is, they ought to be <hi>divers</hi> in their <hi>being,</hi> before they can be <hi>ſeparate</hi> and <hi>diſtinct</hi> in their <hi>material</hi> bulk and quantity. For <hi>ſeparabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> muſt preſuppoſe <hi>diverſity.</hi> (4.) Though <hi>Quantity</hi> be not <hi>actually divided</hi> in one ſenſe, 'tis in another: Every part having a diſtinct place and being of its own, though it doth not yet enjoy it <hi>ſeparately</hi> and <hi>apart</hi> from others.</p>
                  <p>But (2.) it is pleaded againſt <hi>actual parts</hi> in <hi>Quantity,</hi> that if we admit them, we cannot ſtop till we come down to <hi>Indiviſibles;</hi> of which to ſuppoſe <hi>Quantity compoſed,</hi> is ſaid to be abſurd and impoſſible. In return to which, I grant the Inference, and have acknowledged the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of <hi>Indiviſibles</hi> to be full of ſeeming inconſiſtencies; as is the other alſo: And therefore reckon both among the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiveables;</hi> of which there can be no greater Argument then their having driven ſo great and ſagacious wits upon ſuch an Aſſertion, (to which out of reverence to theſe ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated perſons, I ſhall not affix an <hi>Epithete)</hi> againſt the evidence of our <hi>Senſes,</hi> and the apprehenſion of all the world: <hi>That there are no parts in quantity.</hi> But (2.) 'tis no good method of reaſoning, to deny what is <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>obvious,</hi> becauſe we cannot conceive what is <hi>abſtruſe</hi> and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49777:26"/>
                     <hi>difficult.</hi> And I think the Aſſertor cannot anſwer it to his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer faculties, who affirms, there are no <hi>parts actually in quantity,</hi> againſt all his <hi>Senſes</hi> and the <hi>univerſal ſuffrage</hi> of <hi>Mankinde;</hi> becauſe he cannot untie the difficulties that emerge from the ſuppoſal, that <hi>Bodies are compounded of Indiviſibles;</hi> a nice and in tricate <hi>Theory.</hi> Yea how will our Author anſwer for the Aſſertion to his Maſter <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle?</hi> who ſaith <gap reason="foreign">

to whom Sir <hi>K.

And I believe our Author will not reckon, him among the ſlight and talkative Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers; which is ſo far from being true, that ſuch as love only to skim things, and have not the patience to keep their minds to a deep and cloſe attention, cannot with any face as much as <hi>pretend</hi> acquaintance with <hi>his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;</hi> the comprehenſion of which, will require the moſt ſevere meditation, and fix't engagement of the mind, of any <hi>Philoſophy</hi> that is <hi>intelligible.</hi> Not, that this excellent perſon affects <hi>obſcurity</hi> either in <hi>Matter, Style,</hi> or <hi>Method,</hi> being indeed very perſpicuous in all of them: but becauſe, his way is unuſual, and his <hi>Principles</hi> ſo <hi>coherent</hi> and cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pack't together, that the letting fall any <hi>link</hi> of connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will ſpoil the <hi>dependance,</hi> and hinder the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſequel.

Philoſophers 'twill not a little detract from the credit of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>'s <hi>Intellectuals,</hi> if his <hi>Morals</hi> are acknowledg'd, or can be prov'd <hi>obnoxious.</hi> Whither the charge be <hi>juſt</hi> or not, our Philoſopher makes no enquiry, which ſeems a tacite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the <hi>truth</hi> of the accuſation; and then I think he hath no reaſon to object the <hi>impropriety.</hi> After this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark he deſcends (2.) to ſome particular inſtances of <hi>Gaſſendus</hi>'s <hi>charge,</hi> to as many of which, as I am concern'd in, I make this brief rejoynder: (1.) Then <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly makes God an <hi>Animal</hi> in theſe words <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) That <hi>God acts by neceſſity, Ariſtotle</hi> clearly enough inſinuates in that concluſion of his <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which is teſtimony ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient of the truth of my charge; if <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed him of more, 'tis like he was able to make it good.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) That <hi>Ariſtotle made the world eternal,</hi> our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor allows me. But that hereby he prov'd himſelf the chief of all the <hi>Ethnick</hi> Philoſophers, I cannot grant him ſo eaſily. For (1.) <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was not the firſt in this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, but had it from <hi>Ocellus Lucanus;</hi> from whom alſo he tranſcrib'd the Arguments he made uſe of to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force it: Which yet (2.) are not ſuch, as do ſo highly commend his <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> and faculty of arguing. He proves the <hi>World eternal</hi> then, becauſe the <hi>Heavens</hi> are <hi>ſo;</hi> the Aſſertion of which he attempts by five Arguments: <hi>(viz.)</hi> (1.) From the Etymology of <hi>aether, viz. ab</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. (2.) From the <hi>ſilence</hi> of <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of any change or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration they have undergone. (3.) From the <hi>Opinion</hi> of the <hi>Antients.</hi> (4.) From the freedom of the <hi>Heavens</hi> from <hi>contrarieties.</hi> And (5.) from the <hi>eternity</hi> of the <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial motions,</hi> which he proves with the <hi>eternity of time</hi>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:49777:31"/>
by reaſons borrow'd from <hi>Ocellus,</hi> who was the Author of the main Argument. Now whoever affirms that ſuch arguings as theſe ſet <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſo much above all the more <hi>antient</hi> Philoſophers, expreſſes more <hi>fondneſs</hi> towards <hi>him,</hi> then <hi>juſtice</hi> to his <hi>betters.</hi> Nor can the comparative ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his wit be any more reaſonably concluded from his allowing the <hi>natural inference</hi> of that acknowledg'd <hi>Principle, Ex nihilo nihil;</hi> which doubtleſs the Antients never meant in the <hi>general notion;</hi> but in a ſenſe which reſtrain'd it to <hi>natural productions;</hi> elſe their Aſſertion of the <hi>Worlds beginning</hi> had been <hi>nonſenſe</hi> and a <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) The learned Gentleman admires that we ſhould charge <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> with the <hi>denyal</hi> of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the dead; which though he acknowledges <hi>truly</hi> to be <hi>alledg'd;</hi> yet he thinks it <hi>unreaſonably objected,</hi> ſince he ſuppoſes this doctrine only to be diſcoverable by <hi>ſupernatural light</hi> and <hi>revelation.</hi> To which briefly, (1.) Though the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi> in the <hi>particular circumſtances,</hi> in which <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity</hi> hath cloathed it, be not known by our unaſſiſted faculties: Yet that the <hi>Soul</hi> ſhall <hi>live,</hi> and <hi>live united</hi> to a <hi>Body</hi> in the <hi>other State,</hi> I think deducible from the meer <hi>principles</hi> of Nature: For the <hi>Philoſophy</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi> informs us, that <hi>it</hi> uſes <hi>matter</hi> in its <hi>higheſt</hi> operations, which is fair ground of conjecture, that it is alwayes united to ſome <hi>body.</hi> Beſides which, it may be argued from the analogy of <hi>Nature,</hi> which uſeth not in other things, to leap from one <hi>extream</hi> unto another; And therefore 'tis not likely that the Soul ſhould paſs <hi>immediately,</hi> from the ſtate of ſo deep an <hi>immerſion</hi> into the <hi>groſs matter,</hi> to a condition of <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>abſolute immateriality.</hi> To which may be further added, that, even according to the <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> there can be no <hi>Knowledge</hi> without <hi>Senſe,</hi> nor <hi>Senſe</hi> without <hi>corporeal Motion,</hi> which cannot well be <hi>perceiv'd</hi> by a being that is perfectly disjoyn'd
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49777:32"/>
from <hi>matter.</hi> Thus the principles of meer reaſon ſuggeſt, that the <hi>Soul</hi> is joyn'd to <hi>another Body</hi> after its diſcharge from the <hi>preſent.</hi> And (2.) others of the <hi>Greek</hi> Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, by the meer conduct of their natural <hi>light,</hi> believ'd it. The <hi>Academicks</hi> generally aſſign'd <hi>Bodies</hi> to thoſe in the other ſtate, and ſuch as were ſuitable to the regions of the World they reſided in; and therefore <hi>Plato</hi> calls ſome of them <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. And to others of more inferior conditon he attributes <hi>Aerial</hi> bodies; yea, generally the <hi>Greeks</hi> appointed <hi>corporeal</hi> puniſhments for the wicked in their <hi>Acheron,</hi> and <hi>Cocytus,</hi> as <hi>Theocritus,</hi>

But the buſineſs is ſo well known that it needs no teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; and from hence 'tis ſufficiently evident, that they believ'd the <hi>corporeal</hi> ſtate of the Soul after its <hi>ſeparation</hi> from this <hi>Terreſtrial</hi> body: So that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Aſſertion herein, is contrary both to the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>thing;</hi> and the belief of moſt of his <hi>contemporaries;</hi> nay, and the moſt venerable wiſdom that was before him.

                     </gap>.

                  </p>
                  <p>As to the ſecond Inſtance, the learned Gentleman hath miſtaken the words of my charge. For if he pleaſeth to look again into my Book, he will find, that I object no ſuch conſequence to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> as, That if there were more worlds then one, the <hi>Moon</hi> would fall to the <hi>Earth.</hi> But on the contrary, that the Earth would fall to that other
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49777:36"/>
World. So that our Authors juſtification of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, <hi>viz. That he fixt the Centre of the World in the Earth,</hi> is a ſtrange one, and concludes the quite contrary to what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> would inferre. And why the <hi>Moon</hi> ſhould <hi>fall,</hi> upon the ſuppoſitions, that the <hi>Earth</hi> is the <hi>Centre,</hi> and that there are other Worlds, (as our Author ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts) rather then as things are at preſent, I cannot conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.</p>
                  <p>My Third Inſtance of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s <hi>trifling,</hi> and <hi>inconſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent arguings,</hi> was; That he inferrs the <hi>Heavens</hi> to move towards the <hi>Weſt,</hi> becauſe they move towards the more <hi>Honourable,</hi> and <hi>before</hi> is more honourable then <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Which is clearly his conſequence in the 5. Chapter of his ſecond <hi>De Coelo:</hi> For thus he argues, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Nature doth alwayes what is beſt.</hi> Now ſaith he, as the motion which is upwards is more excellent then that which is downward, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; <hi>ſo in like manner is that which is</hi> forward <hi>more excellent then that which is</hi> back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Thence he concludes this the reaſon why the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens move <hi>antrorſum.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. So that this ſeems the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Inference; The <hi>Heavens</hi> move by a motion that is <hi>natural, Nature</hi> doth what is <hi>beſt, before</hi> is <hi>better</hi> then <hi>behind,</hi> and conſequently that way the Heavens <hi>move.</hi> The weakneſs of which argumentation conſiſts in ſuppoſing, that thoſe variable reſpects of <hi>before,</hi> and <hi>after,</hi> are <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities</hi> in <hi>Nature,</hi> which is a <hi>poor</hi> vulgar conceit, ariſing from the meere <hi>prejudice</hi> of <hi>miſapplyed Senſations,</hi> and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unbecomming a Philoſopher. And that this was the ſuppoſal of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Argument, is confirmed by the margin of <hi>Pacius</hi>'s Edition, in which he hath given this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the contents of this period, <hi>Coelum movetur ad anteriorem partem, quia hujuſmodi motus eſt praeſtantior quam motus ad partem poſteriorem.</hi> Yea, when our Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49777:41"/>
expreſſing of which our words are defective: We ſee then, how this pretended <hi>Metaphyſical impoſsibility</hi> may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; For though ſuppoſing a <hi>Vacuum</hi> there be <hi>nihil cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris</hi> between the bodies diſtant, yet is there <hi>aliquid ſpatii,</hi> which is ſufficient to avoid the <hi>contradiction;</hi> ſo that there may be a <hi>vacuum,</hi> notwithſtanding our Author's <hi>Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks:</hi> Yea, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf aſſerted it, though I know he has oppoſed it alſo, is affirmed by <hi>Aetius</hi> in theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>; and there ſeems a ſtrong neceſſity that there ſhould be one, ſince it looks like an impoſſibility that there ſhould be <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in <hi>pleno,</hi> or at leaſt that any thing ſhould be moved, but that all the World muſt be moved with it; which I alledge only to ſhew, that <hi>Metaphyſicks</hi> may both ways be urged almoſt for any thing, and that all matters of noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are double-handed. And if we muſt determine nothing in <hi>Phyſiology</hi> till <hi>Metaphyſicks</hi> have concluded it; for ought I know we ſhall be at an eternal loſs, and never fix on any thing. And by this method of mingling <hi>Metaphyſicks</hi> with <hi>Natural Philoſophy,</hi> we ſhall fill plain Theories with infinite intricacy and diſpute. Indeed, the impatient mind of Man, as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> obſerves, is too apt to fly to <hi>general concluſions;</hi> and more averſe to the way of <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment</hi> and <hi>induction,</hi> which he thought the only method for the eſtabliſhing of a ſolid and grounded Theory: In which there is none has more happily ſucceeded then the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi> whoſe Philoſophy is not a <hi>preſcribed form how things ſhould be made,</hi> as our Author injuriouſly ſuggeſts, but profeſſes it ſelf only an <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> how they <hi>may be,</hi> and how by ſuch Principles the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> may be ſalved: And the <hi>Mechanicks</hi> of <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> are much more likely methods for the expounding Nature, then the <hi>Metaphyſicks</hi> of <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> Which his own Sectators have confeſt a meer <hi>rhapſody</hi> and confuſed ramble of they knew

To the <hi>Fourth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity</hi> of Dogmatizing, our Philoſopher alſo gives a kind reception; and it ſeems can be content with a <hi>Confidence</hi> that accuſeth all the World of <hi>Ignorance.</hi> But whether be the more <hi>modeſt,</hi> the <hi>Dogmatiſt</hi> that chargeth all that are not of his mind as <hi>Ignorants;</hi> or the <hi>Sceptick</hi> that involves himſelf alſo in the common reproach, let them diſpute it out when they will, I have nothing to do with their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel. In the <hi>laſt</hi> I'me agreed with our Author in the <hi>Truth</hi> of his aſſertion, That <hi>Science inlargeth Mens mindes;</hi> but cannot acknowledge the <hi>pertinency.</hi> For he could ſcarce have named things more oppoſite then <hi>Confidence</hi> and <hi>Science. Science</hi> indeed <hi>inlargeth:</hi> But there's a <hi>Knowledge</hi> that only <hi>puffeth up.</hi> And I'me of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Opinion, That 'tis the <hi>Fool that rageth and is confident.</hi> Our Author concludes as he began, in the ſuppoſition that I am a <hi>Sceptick,</hi> and in this I'me <hi>certain</hi> he is miſtaken; <hi>And</hi> will be <hi>Dogmatical</hi> in affirming, that I am <hi>none.</hi>

THus have I concluded my <hi>Reply</hi> with a <hi>Brevity,</hi> that ſhews I am not fond of an occaſion of <hi>Diſputing;</hi> and a <hi>Careleſneſs,</hi> that will witneſs the little delight I have in matters that are not of very <hi>material ſpeculation.</hi> The truth is, I dropt theſe <hi>Reflections</hi> with ſuch a <hi>dulneſs</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>activity</hi> of humor: That when my pen had traced <hi>one peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od,</hi> it was <hi>indifferent</hi> whether it began <hi>another.</hi> And I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not an <hi>heat</hi> in the whole performance. For I felt no concernment to defend a Diſcourſe, which perhaps I had leſs kindneſs for then one, who hath profeſſedly oppoſed it. Not to mention the other reaſons of my <hi>coldneſs</hi> and <hi>indifference</hi> in this Action. And though I have ſtill a quick reſentment of the <hi>Vanity</hi> of <hi>confiding</hi> in <hi>Opinions,</hi> and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly could with an humor brisk enough have reaſſailed the ſpirit of <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>unreaſonable preſumption;</hi> Yet I hitherto ſee no neceſſity of adding more to what I have ſaid on the Subject: And the Reflections that engaged my Pen, have made me but few new occaſions. So that looking on my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned Diſcourſe as too <hi>inconſiderable</hi> for a Subject of <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Vindication,</hi> and meeting but little opportunity for <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> and <hi>diſcurſive notion</hi> in <hi>that</hi> which oppoſed it; I was, I profeſs, ſometimes more inclined to have throwne away <hi>theſe ſheets</hi> among the <hi>rubbiſh</hi> of my Papers, then to permit them thus to ſhew themſelves to the <hi>Publique.</hi> But my <hi>Civility</hi> to this Learned Man obliged me to ſome <hi>Anſwer,</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I apprehend of it otherwiſe, my <hi>lazineſs</hi> or my <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> made me think <hi>this</hi> ſufficient for that ſervice. What others will judge of it I am <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>careleſs,</hi> and am ſufficiently ſatisfied with this, that I think it <hi>pertinent,</hi> and that I have <hi>finiſh't</hi> it.</p>

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49777:45"/>
from that <hi>black night</hi> of <hi>Ignorance</hi> which had with it's <hi>rude Conquerours</hi> invaded it; <hi>Averroes</hi> and ſome others of the <hi>Arabian Interpreters</hi> chanced to light upon the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains</hi> of this <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> which they tranſlated into the language of the <hi>Moors,</hi> and as 'tis uſual for Men to dignifie what they have beſtowed pains upon, eſpecially if it be <hi>rare</hi> and <hi>new;</hi> theſe <hi>firſt Interpreters</hi> would not fail to celebrate the <hi>Author,</hi> that they might reconcile credit to <hi>their</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings upon him, and recommend their own <hi>elucubrations.</hi> And therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſhall be the <hi>prime</hi> of <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> that they may be <hi>next</hi> him. Inſomuch that his <hi>Redeemer A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verroes</hi> arriv'd to that <hi>Vanity</hi> in <hi>Commendation</hi> as to affirm, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> invented <hi>Logick, Divinity</hi> and <hi>Phyſiology;</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpoke any thing without ſtrong reaſon, and that there was nothing <hi>defective</hi> or <hi>ſuperfluous</hi> in his <hi>Writings,</hi> but all things in the moſt full and perfect order; and that no er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had been found in his Compoſures: which <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations</hi> coming down to the <hi>Latines,</hi> with the Books they celebrated, and <hi>they</hi> having no other <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle,</hi> nor <hi>Interpreter,</hi> but his <hi>Idolater Averroes,</hi> greedily ſwallowed both the <hi>Books</hi> and the <hi>Character</hi> together, making <hi>ſacred Text</hi> of the <hi>Writings</hi> of the Author, and <hi>Axioms</hi> of the <hi>Commendations</hi> of the Interpreter. For the <hi>mighty cry</hi> of the firſt <hi>admirers,</hi> aſſiſted by the <hi>Ignorance</hi> of thoſe times, and the natural temper that is in Men to revere the firſt Author that pleaſes them, bore down others to an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to thoſe applauſes; and being at laſt by the <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> mingled with <hi>Divinity,</hi> and by others adopted into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faculties, grew in a manner <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Univerſal. Ariſtotle</hi> became an <hi>Oracle,</hi> his <hi>placits</hi> were enacted <hi>Laws,</hi> and his <hi>dixit</hi> an <hi>unqueſtionable argument;</hi> and thus was the <hi>reaſoning</hi> World deſpoil'd of that <hi>freedom</hi> which is the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of Humane Nature, and ſubjected to a <hi>forreign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> that could lay no reaſonable claim to their reſpect or obſervance. So that the eſteem of the <hi>Ariſtotelean Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy</hi>

having been ſo <hi>ſmall</hi> in the <hi>beſt</hi> and <hi>wiſeſt</hi> times, and having ſprung up to this bulk by <hi>accidental occaſions</hi> in the latter and <hi>leſs cultivated</hi> ages, I cannot yet think it ſo <hi>pia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> to queſtion the dueneſs of thoſe <hi>ſuperlative</hi> praiſes are beſtowed upon him in <hi>theſe,</hi> wherein Mankind ſeems awaken'd to enquire into the <hi>World</hi> of <hi>things,</hi> not of <hi>Words,</hi> and is reſolv'd no longer to court <hi>Names,</hi> but <hi>Nature.</hi> And you'le ſee leſs reaſon for your diſpleaſure againſt that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of mine, when I ſhall have told you</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That 'tis very <hi>doubtful</hi> whether thoſe Writings that go under his <hi>Name,</hi> are <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s or <hi>not.</hi> For beſides that the antient <hi>Greek Interpreters</hi> have alwayes made this <hi>Quaery</hi> in the beginning of their <hi>Expoſitions, Whether the Books they were about to expound were</hi> Ariſtotle<hi>'s;</hi> beſides this ſuſpicion I ſay, ſeveral very learned men have profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly undertook to prove the <hi>uncertainty</hi> of all his Writings, among whom are <hi>Picus, Patricius,</hi> and <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> and from theſe Author's I'le give you a brief account of this matter. (Firſt) then <hi>Theophraſtus, Ariſtotle</hi>'s Scholar, wrote ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things that had the ſame title with thoſe we preſume are <hi>his:</hi> And who then can tell whether they were wrote by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or <hi>Theophraſtus?</hi> to ſay <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Works are diſcoverable by their <hi>ſtyle,</hi> is to preſume the queſtion, <hi>That ſome are known to be his:</hi> which being ſuppoſed, the enquirer may notwithſtanding be deceived in his judgment, ſince learned Men in the ſame age are often delighted with the ſame mode of writing, eſpecially the <hi>Scholars</hi> of any great <hi>Author</hi> uſe to imitate the <hi>Way</hi> and <hi>Method</hi> of their <hi>Maſters;</hi> yea and <hi>diverſity</hi> of <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Matter</hi> make's them ſometimes differ more in their <hi>Styles</hi> from <hi>themſelves,</hi> than others do from <hi>them.</hi> At leaſt (Secondly) <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> had great advantages of <hi>adding, altering,</hi> and <hi>mingling Ariſtotle</hi>'s Works as he pleaſed: He himſelf putting forth few Books while he lived, but leaving them in the hands of this his great Scholar and Sectator. And 'tis the obſervation of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49777:46"/>
                     <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> that the firſt <hi>Peripateticks</hi> had few or none of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Writings among them; upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count impoſtures and forgeries might be more ſecurely practiced. Beſides which, (Thirdly) <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> himſelf did not <hi>publiſh</hi> theſe <hi>Writings,</hi> but left them in the hands of <hi>Neleus,</hi> as is teſtified by <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Athenaeus.</hi> Now this <hi>Neleus</hi> of two Copies which he kept of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, ſold <hi>one</hi> to <hi>Ptolomy</hi> for the famous <hi>Library</hi> at <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria;</hi> the other he kept himſelf and left with his Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; who, as <hi>Strabo</hi> teſtifies, diligent ſearch being made by the <hi>Attalick</hi> Kings after Books to furniſh the <hi>Library</hi> at <hi>Pergamus,</hi> hid them in a pit underground about 160. years till they were almoſt ſpoil'd with <hi>moths</hi> and <hi>rotteneſs,</hi> and after ſold them to <hi>Apellicon Tejus</hi> an <hi>Athenian,</hi> who got them tranſcribed and ſupplyed in thoſe places in which they had been impair'd by their concealment, but as <hi>Strabo</hi> ſays <hi>arbitrarily,</hi> and at a venture; inſomuch that the Tranſcripts were full of errour and incurable defects. At length <hi>Sylla</hi> taking <hi>Athens,</hi> this Library of <hi>Apellicon,</hi> in which were the Writings of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> was tranſported to <hi>Rome,</hi> as is teſtified by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and <hi>there</hi> fell into the hands of <hi>Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio Grammaticus</hi> under whom they contracted new and worſe errors. From him they paſs to <hi>Andronicus Rhodius</hi> who diſtributed them into the order we now find them in, <hi>adding</hi> and <hi>altering</hi> as he pleaſed. After him, <hi>Picus</hi> ſays the contending <hi>Peripateticks</hi> ſtill <hi>mended</hi> what they <hi>underſtood</hi> not; and every man as he fancyed. All which circumſtances are more than ſuſpicions of much <hi>forgery</hi> and <hi>corruption</hi> in <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>'s Compoſures. Yea, if that be true which <hi>Marius Nizolius</hi> aſſerts, and largely endeavours to prove, that moſt of the Books of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> that are extant are but <hi>Epitomes</hi> and <hi>Compendiums</hi> drawn up by <hi>Nicomachus</hi> of his Father's wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, 'twill be another evidence againſt their Authority. To which I add (4.) What has been obſerved by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Learned Men, that <hi>Diogenes Laertius,</hi> who lived when
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49777:46"/>
moſt of the <hi>Antient Authors</hi> might be ſeen, who was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry induſtrious in the ſearch of <hi>Antiquities,</hi> and who peruſed above two hundred Authors in order to the compiling of his <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> forty of which had profeſſedly wrote the <hi>lives</hi> of <hi>Philoſophers;</hi> yet this <hi>Diogenes</hi> hath omitted all we have now extant of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s works except <hi>nine, viz. duo de Plantis, Phyſiogn. Categoriae, de Interpret. Mechan. Contra Xenophanem; Contra Gorgiam &amp; Zenonem.</hi> Yea and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricius</hi> gives ſufficient reaſon why all theſe but the four laſt ſhould be ſuſpected alſo. Now why ſo many forged pieces were aſcribed to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> three reaſons are given by <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monius. viz.</hi> (1.) Becauſe there were ſeveral others of his name <hi>(Diogenes Laertius</hi> ſayes eight) by reaſon of which 'twas an eaſie matter to ſhelter the mean and contemptible products of others under his name and authority. (2.) Becauſe ſeveral of his <hi>Diſciples</hi> wrote Books on the ſame Subjects, and with the ſame Titles with their <hi>Maſter.</hi> (3.) There being great rewards propos'd by <hi>Ptolomy</hi> to thoſe that brought in any conſiderable Author's to his <hi>Library,</hi> ſeveral out of a covetous deſign to enrich themſelves by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, inſcribed other Writings by the Name of <hi>this Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher,</hi> to render them more <hi>currant</hi> and <hi>vendible.</hi> So that there were 40. Books of <hi>Analyticks</hi> aſcribed to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> in <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s <hi>Library,</hi> when as he wrote but four; and two <hi>de Categoriis,</hi> when he wrote but <hi>one.</hi> It appears then that the Books of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> are of very <hi>uncertain</hi> and <hi>ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous authority.</hi> Yea, and though his Writings were never ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpect and certain in the main, yet no man can be aſſur'd in particular what is <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s in them and what not, they having met with ſuch hard uſage as we mention'd. Yea, the Books themſelves give notorious evidence of thoſe abuſes in the <hi>confuſions, inverſions, contradictions, tautologies, defects, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptneſs,</hi> and other groſs <hi>imperfections</hi> they abound with. Upon the account of which <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> ſayes, he thought <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> a greater Man than to be the Author of ſuch <hi>mean</hi>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:49777:47"/>
and <hi>obnoxious</hi> writings. But however, whether theſe are <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine</hi> or not, they contain the <hi>Ariſtotelianiſm</hi> of the preſent <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Schools, and if thoſe works are none of his, there's leſs reaſon why we ſhould fall down before the ΕΦΗ of an <hi>uncertain Authority.</hi> Beſides which, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs</p>

Plato</hi> own's <hi>God</hi> under the <hi>notion</hi> of the <hi>Father;</hi> which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> no where acknowledges. <hi>Plato,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>Supreme Wiſdom; Ariſtotle,</hi> that he is <hi>ignorant</hi> of <hi>particulars. Plato,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>Omnipotent; Ariſtotle,</hi> that he can <hi>do</hi> nothing, but <hi>move</hi> the <hi>Heavens. Plato,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> made the <hi>World; Ariſtotle,</hi> that the <hi>World</hi> is <hi>uncreated,</hi> and <hi>eternal. Plato,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> made the <hi>World</hi> of <hi>nothing; Ariſtotle,</hi> that <hi>of nothing is made nothing. Plato</hi> that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>free</hi> from all <hi>body; Ariſtotle,</hi> that he's <hi>tyed</hi> to the <hi>firſt Orb. Plato,</hi> that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> is over all things; <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that 'tis <hi>confin'd</hi> to the <hi>Heavens. Plato,</hi> that <hi>God governs</hi> the <hi>Univerſe; Ariſtotle,</hi> not <hi>God,</hi> but <hi>Nature, Chance,</hi> and <hi>Fortune. Plato,</hi> that <hi>God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> the <hi>Soul; Ariſtotle,</hi> that 'tis the <hi>Act of the body. Plato,</hi> that the <hi>happineſs</hi> of a Man is in his <hi>likeneſs</hi> to <hi>God; Ariſtotle,</hi> that a Man is <hi>happy</hi> in the <hi>goods</hi> of <hi>Fortune. Plato,</hi> there will come one that ſhall teach us to <hi>pray,</hi> a <hi>prophecy</hi> of our <hi>Saviour. Ariſtotle, prayers</hi> are in <hi>vain,</hi> becauſe <hi>God knows not particulars. Plato,</hi> that after death <hi>good</hi> Men ſhall enjoy <hi>God. Ariſtotle,</hi> no <hi>pleaſure</hi> after this <hi>life. Plato,</hi> the Souls of the wicked ſhall be puniſh't after death; <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> they ſhall <hi>periſh</hi> with the <hi>body,</hi> and ſuffer nothing. <hi>Plato,</hi> the <hi>dead</hi> ſhall <hi>riſe.

But to conclude theſe ungrateful remarques, <hi>Plutarch</hi> makes him a <hi>Traytor</hi> to <hi>Alexander;</hi> and <hi>Euſebius</hi> to his <hi>Countrey.</hi> And being at laſt baniſht for his <hi>impiety,</hi> He made himſelf away by poyſon, according to the Teſtimony of <hi>Laertius.</hi> Thus then you ſee an ill <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle's manners</hi> from <hi>diſintereſſed</hi> Authorities; on conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which, 'tis to me matter of ſome wonder, that the <hi>memory</hi> of the <hi>Vitious</hi> ſhould be ſo <hi>bleſſed,</hi> and his <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> ſo irreproveable.

And I think you aſcribe more to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> then is his due when you call him the <hi>INVENTOUR</hi> of <hi>SCIENCES;</hi> for we owe that honour to others of the <hi>Antients;</hi> particularly to <hi>Zeno</hi> the Invention of <hi>Logick,</hi> and of <hi>Rhetorick</hi> to <hi>Empedocles,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own Teſtimony in <hi>Laertius,</hi>
