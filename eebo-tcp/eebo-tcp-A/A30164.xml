         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
AUTHOR
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Courteous Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS I was considering with my self, what
I had written concerning the <hi>Progress</hi>
of the <hi>Pilgrim</hi> from this World to
Glory; and how it had been acceptable to
many in this Nation: It came again into my
mind to write, as then, of him that was going
to Heaven, so now, of the Life and Death
of the Vngodly, and of their travel from this
world to <hi>Hell.</hi> The which in this I have done,
and have put it, as thou seest, under the Name
and Title of Mr. <hi>Badman,</hi> a Name very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for such a Subject: I have also put it into
the form of a Dialogue, that I might with
more ease to my self, and pleasure to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
perform the work.</p>
            <p>And although, as I said, I have put it forth


<pb facs="tcp:48337:3"/>
in this method, yet have I as little as may be,
gone out of the road of mine own observation of
things. Yea, I think I may truly say, that to
the best of my remembrance, all the things that
here I discourse of, I mean as to matter of fact,
have been acted upon the stage of this World,
even many times before mine eyes.</p>
            <p>Here therefore, courteous Reader, I present
thee with the Life and Death of Mr. <hi>Badman</hi>
indeed: Yea, I do trace him in his Life, from
his Childhood to his Death; that thou mayest,
as in a Glass, behold with thine own eyes, the
steps that take hold of Hell; and also discern,
while thou art reading of Mr. <hi>Badmans</hi> Death,
whether thou thy self art treading in his path
thereto.</p>
            <p>And let me entreat thee to forbear Quirking
and Mocking, for that I say Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> is
dead; but rather gravely enquire concerning
thy self by the Word, whether thou art one of
his Linage or no: For Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> has left
many of his Relations behind him; yea, the
very World is overspread with his Kindred.
True, some of his Relations, as he, are gone to
their place, and long home, but thousands of
thousands are left behind; as Brothers, Sisters,
Cousens, Nephews, besides innumerable of his
Friends and Associates.</p>
            <p>I may say, and yet speak nothing but too
much truth in so saying, that there is scarce


<pb facs="tcp:48337:3"/>
a Fellowship, a Community, or Fraternity of
men in the World, but some of Mr. <hi>Badmans</hi>
Relations are there: yea rarely can we find a
Family or Houshold in a Town, where he has
not left behind him either Brother, Nephew or
Friend.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Butt</hi> therefore, that at this time I shoot
at, is wide; and 'twill be as impossible for this
Book to go into several Families, and not to
arrest some, as for the Kings Messenger to rush
into an house full of Traitors, and find none
but honest men there.</p>
            <p>I cannot but think that this shot will light
upon many, since our fields are so full of <hi>this</hi>
Game; but how many it will <hi>kill</hi> to Mr. <hi>Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
course, and make <hi>alive</hi> to the <hi>Pilgrims
Progress,</hi> that is not in me to determine; this
secret is with the Lord our God only, and he
alone knows to whom he will bless it to so good
and so blessed and end. However, I have put
fire to the Pan, and doubt not but the report
will quickly be heard.</p>
            <p>I told you before, that Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> had
left many of his Friends and Relations behind
him, but if I survive them (as that's a great
question to me) I may also write of their lives:
However, whether my life be longer or shorter,
this is my Prayer at present, that God will stir
up Witnesses against them, that may either
convert or confound them; for wherever they


<pb facs="tcp:48337:4"/>
live, and roll in their wickedness, they are the
Pest and Plague of that Countrey.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> shakes and totters already, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the burden that Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> and his
Friends have wickedly laid upon it: Yea, our
Earth reels and staggereth to and fro like a
Drunkard, the transgression thereof is heavy
upon it.</p>
            <p>Courteous Reader, I will treat thee now, even
at the Door and Threshold of this house, but
only with this Intelligence, that Mr. <hi>Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
lies dead within. Be pleased therefore
(if thy leisure will serve thee) to enter in, and
behold the state in which he is laid, betwixt
his Death-bed and the Grave. He is not buried
as yet, nor doth he stink, as is designed he shall,
before he lies down in oblivion.</p>
            <p>Now as others have had their Funerals
solemnized, according to their Greatness and
Grandure in the world, so likewise Mr. <hi>Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
(forasmuch as he deserveth not to go
down to his grave with silence) has his Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
state according to his deserts.</p>
            <p>Four things are usual at great mens Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
which we will take leave, and I hope
without offence, to allude to, in the Funeral of
Mr. <hi>Badman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, They are sometimes, when dead, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to their Friends, by their compleatly
wrought Images, as lively as by cunning mens


<pb facs="tcp:48337:4"/>
hands they can be; that the remembrance of
them may be renewed to their survivors, the
remembrance of them and their deeds: And
this I have endeavoured to answer in my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of Mr. <hi>Badman;</hi> and therefore I have
drawn him forth in his featours and actions
from his Childhood to his Gray hairs. Here
therefore thou hast him lively set forth as in
<hi>Cutts;</hi> both as to the minority, flower, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niority
of his Age, together with those actions
of his life, that he was most capable of doing,
in, and under those present circumstances of
time, place, strength; and the opportunities
that did attend him in <hi>these.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, There is also usual at great mens
Funerals, those Badges and Scutcheons of their
honour, that they have received from their
Ancestors, or have been thought worthy of
for the deeds and exploits they have done in
their life: And here Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> has his,
but such as vary from all men of worth, but
so much the more agreeing with the merit of
his doings: They all have descended in state,
he only as an abominable branch. His deserts
are the deserts of sin, and therefore the
Scutcheons of honour that he has, are only that
he died without Honour, and at his end be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a fool. <hi>Thou shalt not be joyned with
them in burial.—The seed of evil doers
shall never be renowned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48337:5"/>
The Funeral pomp therefore of Mr. <hi>Badman,</hi>
is to wear upon his Hearse the Badges of a disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
and wicked life; since his bones are
full of the sins of his Youth, which shall lye down,
as <hi>Job</hi> sayes, in the dust with him: nor is it fit
that any should be his Attendants, now at his
death, but such as with him conspired against
their own souls in their life; persons whose
transgressions have made them infamous to all
2that have or shall know what they have done.</p>
            <p>Some notice therefore I have also here in
this little discourse given the Reader, of them
who were his Confederates in his life, and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants
at his death; with a hint, either of
some high Villany committed by them, as also
of those Judgments that have overtaken and
fallen upon them from the just and revenging
hand of God. All which are things either fully
known by me, as being eye and car-witness
thereto, or that I have received from such
hands, whose relation as to this, I am bound
to believe. And that the Reader may know
them from other things and passages herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
I have pointed at them in the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rgent,
as with a finger thus: ☞</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Funerals of persons of Quality
have been solemnized with some suitable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
at the time and place of their Burial; but
that I am not come to as yet, having got no
further than to Mr. <hi>Badmans</hi> death: but for


<pb facs="tcp:48337:5"/>
as much as he must be buried, after he hath
stunk out his time before his beholders, I doubt
not but some such that we read are appointed
to be at the burial of <hi>Gog,</hi> will do this work
in my stead; such as shall leave him neither
skin nor bone above ground, but shall set a sign
by it till the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Badman</hi> differs from others; his Familiars
cannot lament his departure, for they have not
sence of his damnable state; they rather ring
him, and sing him to Hell in the sleep of death,
in which he goes thither. Good men count him
no loss to the world, his place can well be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him, his loss is only his own, and 'tis too
late for him to recover that dammage or loss
by a Sea of bloody tears, could he shed them.
Yea, God has said, he will laugh at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
who then shall lament for him, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Ah! my brother. He was but a stinking
Weed in his life; nor was he better at all in
his death: such may well be thrown over the
wall without sorrow, when once God has plucked
them up by the roots in his wrath.</p>

of Mail,</hi> and with the Staffe of a Spear, for
that his surviving friends will know what he
doth: but I have adventured to do it, and to
play, at this time, at the hole of these Asps; if
they bite, they bite; if they sting, they sting.
Christ sends his <hi>Lambs</hi> in the midst of <hi>Wolves,</hi>
not to do like them, but to suffer by them for
bearing plain testimony against their bad deeds:
But had one not need to walk with a Guard,
and to have a Sentinel stand at ones door for
this? Verily, the flesh would be glad of such
help; yea, a spiritual man, could he tell how
to get it. <hi>Acts</hi> 23. But I am stript naked of
these, and yet am commanded to be faithful
in my servicce for Christ. Well then, I have
spoken what I have spoken, and now come on
me what will, <hi>Job</hi> 13. 13. True, the Text
sayes, <hi>Rebuke a scorner, and he will hate
thee;</hi> and that, <hi>He that reproveth a wicked
man, getteth himself a Blot and Shame;</hi> but
what then? <hi>Open rebuke is better than se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
love;</hi> and he that receives it, shall find
it so afterwards.</p>
            <p>So then, whether Mr. <hi>Badmans</hi> friends shall
rage or laugh at what I have writ, I know
that the better end of the staffe is mine. My
endeavour is to stop an hellish Course of Life,
and to save a soul from death, (<hi>Jam.</hi> 5.)
and if for so doing, I meet with envy from


<pb facs="tcp:48337:7"/>
them, from whom in reason I should have
thanks, I must remember the man in the dream,
that cut his way through his armed enemies,
and so got into the beauteous Palace; I must,
I say, remember him, and do my self likewise.</p>
            <p>Yet four things I will propound to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of Mr. <hi>Badmans</hi> friends, before I
turn my back upon them.</p>
            <p>1. Suppose that there be an Hell in very
deed, not that I do question it, any more than
I do whether there be a Sun to shine; but I
suppose it for argument sake, with Mr. <hi>Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
friends; I say, suppose there be an Hell,
and that too, such an one as the Scripture
speaks of, one at the remotest distance from
God and Life eternall, one where the Worm
of a guilty Conscience never dyes, and where the
fire of the Wrath of God is not quenched.</p>
            <p>Suppose, I say, that there is such an Hell,
prepared of God (as there is indeed) for the
body and soul of the ungodly World after this
life, to be tormented in: I say, do but with thy
self suppose it, and then tell me, Is it not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for thee, thou being a wicked man?
Let thy conscience speak, I say, is it not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for thee, thou being an ungodly man?
And dost thou think, wast thou there now, that
thou art able to wrestle with the judgment of
God? Why then do the fallen Angels tremble
there? thy <hi>hands</hi> cannot be <hi>strong,</hi> nor <hi>can


<pb facs="tcp:48337:7"/>
thy heart endure,</hi> in <hi>that day</hi> when <hi>God</hi> shall
<hi>deal with thee:</hi> Ezek. 22. 14.</p>
            <p>2. Suppose that some one that is now a soul
in Hell for sin, was permitted to come hither
again to dwelt; and that they had a grant
also, that upon amendment of life, next time
they dye, to change that place for Heaven and
Glory; what sayest thou, O wicked man? would
such an one (thinkest thou) run again into
the same course of life as before, and venture
the damnation that for sin he had already been
in? Would he choose again to lead that cursed
life that afresh would kindle the flames of
Hell upon him, and that would bind him up
under the heavy wrath of God? O! he would
not, he would not; the sixteenth of <hi>Luke</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuates
it: yea Reason it self, awake, would
abhorr it, and tremble at such a thought.</p>
            <p>2. Suppose again, that thou that livest
and rollest in thy sin, and that as yet hast
known nothing but the pleasure thereof, shouldst
be by an Angel conveyed to some place where
with convenience, from thence thou mightest
have a view of Heaven and Hell; of the
Joyes of the one, and the torments of the other;
I say, suppose that from thence thou mightest
have such a view thereof, as would convince
thy reason, that both Heaven and Hell, are
such realities as by the Word they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to be; wouldest thou (thinkest thou)


<pb facs="tcp:48337:8"/>
when brought to thy home again, chuse to thy
self thy former life, to wit, to return to thy
folly again? No; if belief of what thou sawest,
remained with thee, thou wouldest eat. Fire and
Brimstone first.</p>
            <p>4. I will propound again. Suppose that
there was amongst us such a Law, (and such
a Magistrate to inflict the penalty,) That for
every open wickedness committed by thee, so
much of thy flesh should with burning Pinoers be
plucked from thy Bones: Wouldest thou then go
on in thy open way of Lying, Swearing, Drinking
and Whoring, as thou with delight doest now?
Surely, surely, No: The fear of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would make thee forbear; yea, would
make thee tremble, even then when thy lusts
were powerfull, to think what a punishment
thou wast sure to sustain, so soon as the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
was over. But Oh! the folly, the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the desperate madness that is in the
hearts of Mr. <hi>Badmans</hi> friends, who in despite
of the threatnings of an holy and sin revenging
God, and of the outcries and warnings of all
good men; yea, that will in despite of the
groans and torments of those that are now in
Hell for sin, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 24. 28.) go on in
a sinfull course of life; yea, though every sin
is also a step of descent, down to that infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Cave. O how true is that saying of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
The heart of the sons of men is full of


<pb facs="tcp:48337:8"/>
evil, and madness is in their heart while they
live, and after that they go to the dead,</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.
9. 3. To the <hi>dead!</hi> that is, to the dead
in Hell, to the damned dead; the place to
which those that have dyed <hi>Bad men</hi> are gone,
and that those that live <hi>Bad men</hi> are like to
go to, when a little more sin, like stollen waters,
hath been imbibed by their sinful souls.</p>
            <p>That which has made me publish this Book is,</p>
            <p>1. For that wickedness like a flood is like
to drown our English world: it begins already
to be above the tops of mountains; it has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
swallowed up all; our Youth, our Middle
age, Old age, and all, are almost carried away
of this flood. O Debauchery, Debauchery,
what hast thou done in <hi>England!</hi> Thou hast
corrupted our Young men, and hast made our
Old men beasts; thou hast deflowered our Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,
and hast made Matrons Bawds. Thou
hast made our earth to reel to and fro like a
<hi>drunkard;</hi> 'tis in danger to be removed like a
Cottage, yea, it is, because transgression is so
heavy upon it, like to <hi>fall and rise no more,
Isa.</hi> 24. 20.</p>
            <p>O! that I could mourn for <hi>England,</hi> and
for the sins that are committed therein, even
while I see that without repentance, the men
of Gods wrath are about to deal with us, each
having his slaughtering weapon in his hand:
(<hi>Ezek</hi> 9. 1, 2.) Well, I have <hi>written,</hi> and


<pb facs="tcp:48337:9"/>
by Gods assistance shall <hi>pray,</hi> that this flood
may abate in <hi>England:</hi> and could I but see
the tops of the Mountains above it, I should
think that these waters were abating.</p>
            <p>2. It is the duty of those that can, to cry
out against this deadly plague, yea, to <hi>lift up
their voice as with a Trumpet</hi> against it;
that men may be awakened about it, slye from
it, as from that which is the greatest of evils.
Sin pull'd Angels out of Heaven, pulls men
down to Hell, and overthroweth Kingdoms.
Who, that sees an house on fire, will not give
the Allarum to them that dwell therein? who
that sees the Land invaded, will not set the
Beacons on a flame? Who, that sees the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
as roaring Lyons continually devouring
souls, will not make an Out-cry? But above
all, when we see <hi>sin,</hi> sinful <hi>sin,</hi> a swallowing
up a Nation, sinking of a Nation, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its Inhabitants to temporal, spiritual, and
eternal ruine, shall we not cry out, and cry,
They are drunk, but not with Wine; they
stagger, but not with strong drink; they are
intoxicated with the deadly poyson of sin, which
will, if its malignity be not by wholsom means
allayed, bring Soul and Body, and Estate, and
Countrey, and all, to ruin and destruction?</p>
            <p>3. In and by this my Out-cry, I shall deliver
my self from the ruins of them that perish: for
a man can do no more in this matter, I mean a


<pb facs="tcp:48337:9"/>
man in my capacity, than to detect and condemn
the wickedness, warn the evil doer of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and fly therefrom my self. But Oh! that
I might not only deliver my self! Oh that many
would hear, and turn at this my cry, from sin!
that they may be secured from the death and
Judgment that attend it.</p>
            <p>Why I have handled the matter in this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
is best known to my self: and why I have
concealed most of the Names of the persons whose
sins or punishments I here and there in this Book
make relation of, is,</p>
            <p>1. For that neither the sins nor Judgments
were all alike open; the sins of some, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
and the Judgments executed for them
only in a corner. Not to say that I could not
learn some of their names; for could I, I should
not have made them publick, for this reason.</p>
            <p>2. Because I would not provoke those of their
Relations that survive them; I would not justly
provoke them, and yet, as I think, I should, should
I have intailed their <hi>punishment</hi> to their <hi>sins,</hi>
and <hi>both</hi> to their <hi>names,</hi> and so have turned
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hem into the world.</p>
            <p>3. Nor would I lay them under disgrace and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ontempt, which would, as I think, unavoidably
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ave happened unto them had I withall insert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>d
their Names.</p>
            <p>As for those whose Names I mention, their

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rimes or Judgments were manifest; publick al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most


<pb facs="tcp:48337:10"/>
as any thing of that nature that happeneth
to mortal men. Such therefore have published
<hi>their own-shame</hi> by their sin, and God, <hi>his
anger,</hi> by taking of open vengeance.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Job</hi> sayes, <hi>God has strook them as wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

Mr. BADMAN,

               <speaker>Wiseman.</speaker>
               <p>GOOD morrow my good
Neighbour, Mr. <hi>Attentive;</hi>
whither are you walking
so early this morning? methinks
you look as if you were concerned
about something more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.
Have you lost any of your
Cattel, or what is the matter?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Attentive.</speaker>
               <p>Good Sir, Good morrow
to you, I have not as yet lost ought,
but yet you give a right ghess of me,
for I am, as you say, concerned in my
heart, but 'tis because of the <hi>badness</hi> of
the times. And Sir, you, as all our


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48337:15"/>
Neighbours know, are a very observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
man, pray therefore what do you
think of them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>Why? I think, as you
say, to wit, that they are <hi>bad times,</hi>
and <hi>bad</hi> they will be, untill <hi>men</hi> are
better: for they are <hi>bad men</hi> that
make <hi>bad times;</hi> if men therefore
would mend, so would the times.
'Tis a folly to look for good dayes,
so long as sin is so high, and those
that study its nourishment so many.
God bring it down, and those that
nourish it to Repentance, and then
my good Neighbour, you will be
concerned, not as you are now:
Now you are concerned because
times are so <hi>bad;</hi> but then you will
be so, cause times are so <hi>good:</hi>
Now you are concerned so as to be
perplexed, but then you will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
so as to lift up your voice
with shouting; for I dare say, could
you see such dayes they would make
you shout.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>Ai, so they would, such
times I have prayed for, such times
I have longed for: but I fear they'l
be worse before they be better.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>Make no Conclusions, man:


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48337:15"/>
for he that hath the hearts of men
in his hand, can change them from
worse to better, and so bad times
into good. God give long life to
them that are good, and especially
to those of them that are capable of
doing him service in the world. The
Ornament and Beauty of this lower
World, next to God and his Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
are the men that spangle and
shine in godliness.</p>
               <p>Now as Mr. <hi>Wiseman</hi> said this,
he gave a <hi>great sigh.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>Amen. Amen. But why,
good Sir, do you sigh so deeply? is it
for ought else than that for the which
as you have perceived, I my self am
concerned?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>I am concerned with you,
for the badness of the times; but
that was not the cause of that sigh,
of the which, as I see, you take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.
I sighed at the remembrance
of the death of that man for whom
the Bell tolled at our Town yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>Why? I trow, Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
your Neighbour is not dead. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
I did hear that he had been sick.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>No, no, it is not he. Had


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48337:16"/>
it been he, I could not but have
been concerned, but yet not as I
am concerned now. If he had died,
I should only have been concerned
for that the world had lost a Light:
but the man that I am concerned for
now, was oue that never was good,
therefore such an one who is not
dead only, but damned. He died
that he might die, he went from
Life to Death, and then from Death
to Death, from Death Natural to
death Eternal. And as he spake this,
the water stood in his eyes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed, to goe from a
death-bed to Hell is a fearful thing
to think on. But good Neighbour
<hi>Wiseman,</hi> he pleased to tell me who
this man was, and why you conclude
him so miserable in his death?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>Well, if you can stay, I
will tell you who he was, and why
I conclude thus concerning him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>My leisure will admit me
to stay, and I am willing to hear you
out. And I pray God your discourse
may take hold on my heart, that I may
be bettered thereby. So they agreed
to sit down under a tree: <hi>Then Mr.</hi>
Wiseman <hi>proceeded as followeth.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:48337:16"/>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>The man that I mean, is
one Mr. <hi>Badman;</hi> he has lived in
our Town a great while, and now,
as I said, he is dead. But the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of my being so concerned at
his death, is, not for that he was at
all related to me, or for that any
good conditions died with him, for
he was far from them, but for that,
as I greatly fear, he hath, as was
hinted before, died two deaths at
once.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>I perceive what you mean
by two deaths at once; and to speak
truth, 'tis a fearfull thing thus to
have ground to think of any: for
although the death of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ungodly
and sinners is laid to heart but of
few, yet to die in such a state, is
more dreadful and fearful than any
man can imagine. Indeed if a man
had no Soul, if his state was not
truely Immortal, the matter would
not be so much; but for a man to be
so disposed of by his Maker, as to be
appointed a sensible being for ever,
and for him too to fall into the hands
of revenging Justice, that will be
always, to the utmost extremity that
his sin deserveth, punisbing of him


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48337:17"/>
in the dismal dungeon of Hell, this
must needs be unutterably sad, and
lamentable.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>There is no man, I think,
that is sensible of the worth of one
Soul, but must, when he hears of
the death of unconverted men, he
stricken with sorrow and grief: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
as you said well, that mans
state is such, that he has a sensible
being for ever. For 'tis <hi>sense</hi> that
makes punishment heavy. But yet
<hi>sense</hi> is not all that the Damned have,
they have <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>reason</hi> too; so
then, as Sense receiveth punishment
with sorrow because it feels, and
bleeds under the same, so by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and the exercise thereof, in the
midst of torment, all present Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
is aggravated, and that three
manner of wayes:</p>
               <p>1. Reason will consider thus with
himself; For what am I thus tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented?
and will easily find 'tis for
nothing but that base and filthy
thing, Sin; and now will Vexation
be mixed with Punishment, and
that will greatly heighten the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</p>
               <p>2. Reason will consider thus with


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48337:17"/>
himself. How long must this be my
state? And will soon return to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
this Answer: This must be my
state for ever and ever. Now this
will greatly increase the torment.</p>
               <p>3. Reason will consider thus with
himself; What have I lost more
than present ease and quiet by my
sins that I have committed? And
will quickly return himself this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer:
I have lost Communion with
God, Christ, Saints and Angels,
and a share in Heaven and eternal
Life: And this also must needs grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the misery of poor damned
souls. And this is the case of Mr.
<hi>Badman.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>I feel my heart even shake
at the thoughts of coming into such a
state. Hell! who knows that is yet
alive, what the torments of Hell are?
This word Hell gives a very dreadful
sound.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>

                  </gap>, so it does in the ears of
him that has a tender Conscience.
But if, as you say, and that truly,
the very <hi>Name</hi> of Hell, is so dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
what is the Place it self, and
what are the Punishments that are
there inflicted, and that without the


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48337:18"/>
least intermission, upon the Souls of
damned men, for ever and ever.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but passing this; my
leisure will admit me to stay, and
therefore pray tell me what it is that
makes you think that Mr. <hi>Badman</hi>
is gone to Hell.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>

               <p>I will endeavour to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
your desires, and first, I will
tell you, that from a Child he was
very <hi>bad:</hi> his very beginning was


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48337:19"/>
                  <hi>ominous,</hi> and presaged that no good
end, was, in likelyhood, to follow
thereupon. There were several sins
that he was given to, when but a
little one, that manifested him to
be notoriously infected with Orgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
corruption; for I dare say he
learned none of them of his Father
or Mother; nor was he admitted
to go much abroad among other
Children, that were vile, to learn
to sin of them: Nay, contrariwise,
if at any time he did get abroad
amongst others, he would be as the
Inventer of bad words, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
in bad actions. To them all
he used to be, as we say, the Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leader,
and Master-sinner from a
Childe.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>This was a bad Beginning
indeed, and did demonstrate that he
was, as you say, polluted, very much
polluted with Original Corruption.
For to speak my mind freely, I do
confess, that it is mine opinion, that
Children come polluted with sin into
the World, and that oft-times the
sins of their youth,<note place="margin">Original sin is the root of Actual transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> especially while
they are very young, are rather by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of Indwelling sin, than by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48337:19"/>
that are set before them by others.
Not but that they learn to sin by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
too, but Example is not the
root, but rather the Temptation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
wickedness. The root is sin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;<note place="margin">Mark. 7.</note>

               <p>I am glad to hear that you
are of this opinion, and to confirm
what you have said by a few hints
from the Word.<note place="margin">Job. 11. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

came upon all; and renders this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

is that Objection worth a rush, That

Original Sin. First, Because it is
Scriptureless. Secondly, Because it

other things might be added, but
between persons so well agreed as

               <p>The want of good Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
as you have intimated, is
many times a cause why Children
doe so easily, so soon, become bad;
especially when there is not only a
want of that, but bad Examples

there is in many Families; by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue

trained up in Sin, and nursed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

was otherwise with Mr. <hi>Badman,</hi>
for to my knowledge, this his way
of Lying, was a great grief to his
Parents, for their hearts were much
dejected at this beginning of their
Son; nor did there want Counsel

if that would have made him better,

one old <hi>Tod,</hi> that was hanged
about Twenty years agoe, or more,

Thief from a Child: When I was but
a little one, I gave my self to rob
Orchards, and to do other such like
wicked things, and I have continued
a Thief ever since. My Lord, there
has not been a Robbery committed
thus many years, within so many

been at it, or privy to it.</p>
               <p>The Judge thought the fellow

               <p>It is not only remarkable,
but pat to our purpose. This Thief,


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48337:26"/>
like Mr. <hi>Badman,</hi> began his Trade
betimes; he began too where Mr.
<hi>Badman</hi> began, even at robbing of
Orchards, and other such things,
which brought him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as you may
perceive, from sin to sin, till at last
it brought him to the publick shame
of sin, which is the Gallows.</p>
               <p>As for the truth of this Story,
the Relator told me that he was at
the same time himself in the Court,
and stood within less than two yards
of old <hi>Tod,</hi> when he heard him aloud

               <p>Why what other sins was

            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>You need not ask, to what
other sins was he, but to what other
sins was he not addicted, that is,
of such as suited with his Age: for
a man may safely say, that nothing
that was vile came amiss to him; if
he was but capable to do it. Indeed
some sins there be that Childhood
knows not how to be tampering
with; but I speak of sins that he was
capable of committing, of which I
will nominate two or three more.
And,</p>
               <p>First, He could not endure the

of that Day was to him as if
he was going to Prison, (except he
could get out from his Father and
Mother, and lurk in by-holes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his Companions, untill holy
Duties were over.) Reading the
Scriptures, hearing Sermons, godly
Conference, repeating of Sermons,

could not away with; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if his Father on such days

(as often he did, though sometimes
notwithstanding his diligence, he
would be sure to give him the slip)
did keep him strictly to the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation

shew by all carriages that he was
highly discontent therewith: he
would sleep at Duties, would talk

               <p>It cannot be any thing that
is good, you may be sure; because
the thing it self is abominable:
<note n="*" place="margin">Six Causes of vain Swearing.</note> 1. Therefore it must be from the
promptings of the spirit of the Devil
within them. 2. Also it flows some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
from hellish Rage, when the

the whole course of nature.<note place="margin">Jam. 3. 6, 7, 8, 9.</note> 3. But
commonly Swearing flows from that
daring Boldness that biddeth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
to the Law that forbids it.
4. Swearers think also that by their
belching of their blasphemous Oaths
out of their black and polluted
mouths, they shew themselves the
more valiant men: 5. And imagine
also, that by these outrageous kind


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48337:33"/>
of villianies, they shall conquer those
that at such a time they have to do
with, and make them believe their
lyes to be true: 6. They also swear
frequently to get Gain thereby,
and when they meet with fools, they
overcome them this way. But if
I might give advice in this matter,
no Buyer should lay out one farthing
with him that is a common Swearer
in his Calling; especially with such
an Oath-master that endeavoureth to

immediately to do with the Name of
God, and it calls upon him to be
witness to the truth of what is said:
That is, if they that swear, swear
by him. Some indeed swear by
Idols, as by the <hi>Mass,</hi> by our <hi>Lady,</hi>


                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:48337:33"/>
by <hi>Saints, Beasts, Birds,</hi> and other
creatures; but the usual way of our
profane ones in <hi>England,</hi> is to swear
by God, Christ, Faith, and the like:
But however, or by whatever they
swear, Cursing is distinguished from
Swearing thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Of Cursing, what it is.</note> To Curse, to Curse profanely, it is
to sentence another or our self, for,
or to evil: or to wish that some evil
might happen to the person or thing
under the Curse, unjustly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is to sentence for, or to evil,
(that is, without a cause): Thus</hi>
Shimei <hi>cursed</hi> David: <hi>He sentenced
him for and to evil unjustly, when he
said to him,</hi> Come out,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 16. 6, 7, 8.</note> come out thou
bloody man, and thou man of Belial.
The Lord hath returned upon thee all
the blood of the house of <hi>Saul,</hi> in whose
stead thou hast reigned, and the Lord
hath delivered the kingdom into the
hand of <hi>Absalom</hi> thy son: and behold
thou art taken in thy mischief, because
thou art a bloody man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This</hi> David <hi>calls a grievous Curse.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 King. 2. 8.</note>
And behold, <hi>saith he to</hi> Solomon <hi>his

which cursed me with a grievous
curse in the day when I went to <hi>Maha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naim.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:48337:34"/>
But what was this Curse? Why,
Eirst, It was a wrong sentence past
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pon <hi>David; Shimei</hi> called him
Bloody man, man of <hi>Belial,</hi> when
he was not. Secondly, He senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him to the evil that at present
was upon him, for being a bloody
man, (that is, against the house of
<hi>Saul,</hi>) when that present evil over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
<hi>David,</hi> for quite another
thing.</p>
               <p>And we may thus apply it to the
<note n="*" place="margin">How the profane ones of our times Curse.</note> profane ones of our times, who
in their rage and envy, have little
else in their mouths but a sentence
against their Neighbour for, and to
evil unjustly. How common is it
with many, when they are but a little
offended with one, to cry, <hi>Hang
him, Damn him, Rogue!</hi> This is both
a sentencing of him for, and to
evil, and is in it self a grievous
Curse.</p>
               <p>2. The other kind of Cursing, is
to wish that some evil might happen
to, and overtake this or that person
or thing: And this kind of Cursing,
<hi>Job</hi> counted a grievous sin. <hi>I have
not suffered</hi> (says he) <hi>my mouth to sin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 30. 31.</note>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48337:34"/>
to Body or Estate. This
then is a wicked cursing, to wish
that evil might either befall another
or our selves: And this kind of cursing
young <hi>Badman</hi> accustomed himself
unto.</p>
               <p>1. He would wish that evil might
befall others;<note place="margin">Badmans way of Cursing.</note> he would wish their

was upon them, and the like: All
which is a devilish kind of cursing,
and is become one of the common
sins of our age.</p>
               <p>2. He would also as often wish a
Curse to himself, saying, Would I
might be hanged, or burned, or that
the Devil might fetch me, if it be
not so, or the like. We count
the<note n="*" place="margin">The Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me Blade.</note>

curse than swear; yea, curse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and that with a Wish that

which wish and Curse of
theirs, in a little time, they will see

She also used the same wicked

The thing is this; About a bow-sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

from where I once dwelt, there was
a blind Ale-house, and the man that
kept it had a Son whose name was
<hi>Edward.</hi> This <hi>Edward</hi> was, as it
were, an <hi>half-fool,</hi> both in his words,
and manner of behaviour. To this
blind Ale-house certain jovi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
would once or twice a week come,
and this <hi>Ned,</hi> (for so they called
him his Father would entertain his


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48337:38"/>
guests withall; to wit, by calling for
him to make them sport by his foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
words and gestures. So when
these boon blades came to this mans
house, the Father would call for <hi>Ned:
Ned</hi> therefore would come forth; and
the villain was devilishly addicted to
cursing, yea to cursing his Father and
Mother, and any one else that did cross
him. And because (though he was
an half-fool) he saw that his practice
was pleasing, he would do it with the
more audaciousness.</p>
               <p>Well, when these brave fellows did
come at their times to this Tippling-house
(as they call it) to fuddle and
make merry, then must <hi>Ned</hi> be called
out; and because his Father was best
acquainted with <hi>Ned,</hi> and best knew
how to provoke him, therefore <hi>He</hi>
would usually ask him such questions,
or command him such business, as
would be sure to provoke him indeed.
Then would be (after his foolish man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner)
Curse his Father most bitterly;
at which the old man would laugh,
(and so would the rest of the guests,
as at that which pleased them best)
still continuing to ask, that <hi>Ned</hi> still
might be provoked to curse, that they


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48337:39"/>
might still be provoked to laugh. This
was the mirth with which the old man
did use to entertain his guests.</p>
               <p>The curses wherewith this <hi>Ned</hi> did
use to curse his father, and at which
the old man would laugh, were these,
and such like: <hi>The Devil take you;
The Devil fetch you:</hi> He would also
wish him Plagues and Destructions
many. Well, so it came to pass, through
the righteous Judgement of God, that
<hi>Neds</hi> Wishes and Curses were in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
time fulfilled upon his Father; for
not many months passed between them
after this manner, but the <hi>Devil</hi> did
indeed take him, possess him, and also
in few days carried him out of this
world by death; I say, Satan did take
him and possess him: I mean, so it was
judged by those that knew him, and
had to do with him in that his lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table-condition.
He could feel him
like a live thing goe up and down in his
body, but when tormenting time was
come (as he had often tormenting
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

mean, <hi>I</hi> saw it so,) and so would rent
and tare him, and make him roar til
he died away.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:48337:39"/>
I told you before, that I was an ear
and eye witness of what <hi>I</hi> here say;
and so I was. I have heard <hi>Ned</hi> in
his Roguery, cursing his Father, and
his Father laughing thereat most hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ily;
still provoking of <hi>Ned</hi> to curse,
that his mirth might be encreased. I
saw his Father also, when he was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed,
<hi>I</hi> saw him in one of his fits,
and saw his flesh (as 'twas thought) by
the Devil, gathered up on an heap,
about the bigness of half an Egge; to
the unutterable torture and afflicton
of the old man. There was also one
<hi>Freeman,</hi> (who was more than an

attempted to do it: The manner where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

yet that Lad may be ruined many

circumspect in all things that respect

his Apprentice.</p>

Yea, many Children that have been

that if a man have any respect either

the truth is, where this sin gets the

For, (as I told you before) as he
learned of these three Villains to be
a Beastly Drunkard; so he learned
of them to pilfer and steal from his
Master. Sometimes he would fell
off his Masters Goods, but keep the
Money, that is when he could; also
sometimes he would beguile his
Master by taking out of his Cash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>box:
and when he could do neither of
these, he would convey away of his
Masters wares, what he thought
would be least missed, and send or
carry them to such and such houses,

up to his use, and then appoint set

               <p>Then it seems you think

               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>I have thought so indeed,
and that for this reason: We see
that this Disease is entailed as I
may say, to this most beastly sin,
nor is there any disease so entailed
to any other sin, as this to this.
That this is the sin to which the
strange Punishment is entailed, you
will easily perceive when you read
the Text. <hi>I made a covenant with
mine eyes,</hi> said Job, <hi>why should I
think upon a Maid? For what por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is there</hi> (for that sin) <hi>from above,
and what Inheritance of the Almighty
from on high?</hi> And then he answers
himself; <hi>Is not destruction to the
wicked, and a strange punishment to
the workers of iniquity?</hi> This strange
Punishment is the <hi>Pox.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Also I think that this foul Disease
is that which <hi>Solomon</hi> intends, when
he saith, (speaking of this unclean
and beastly creature)<note place="margin">Prov. 6. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>A wound and

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48337:58"/>
and Dishonour, <hi>Solomon</hi> calls it; and
they both do set it as a Remark
upon this sin; <hi>Job</hi> calling it a
<hi>strange punishment,</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> a
<hi>reproach that shall not be turned away</hi>
from them that are common in it.</p>

               <p>Why, often-times it is

               <p>☞ I will tell you another story. An
ancient man, one of mine acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
a man of good credit in our
Countrey, had a Mother that was a
Midwise: who was mostly imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in laying great persons. To this
womans house, upon a time, comes
a brave young Gallant on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
to fetch her to lay a young
Lady. So she addresses herself to
go with him; wherefore, he takes
her up behind him, and away they


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48337:58"/>
ride in the night. Now they had
not rid far, but the Gentleman litt
off his horse, and taking the old
Midwife in his arms from the horse,
turned round with her several times,
and then set her up again; then he
got up, and away they went till
they came at a stately house, into
which he had her, and so into a
Chamber where the young Lady
was in her pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s: He then bid the
Midwife do her Office, and she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
help, but he drew out his
Sword and told her, if she did not
make speed to do her Office with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
she must look for nothing but
death. Well, to be short, this old
Midwife laid the young Lady, and
a fine sweet. Babe she had; Now
there was made in a Room hard by,
a very great Fire: so the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
took up the Babe, went and
drew the coals from the stock, cast
the Child in, and covered it up, and
there was an end of that. So when
the Midwife had done her work, he
paid her well for her pains, but shut
her up in a dark room all day, and
when night came, took her up behind
him again, and carried her away,


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48337:59"/>
till she came almost at home; then
he turned her round, and round, as
he did before, aud had her to her
house, set her down, bid her Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,
and away he went: And she
could never tell who it was.</p>
               <p>This Story the Midwifes son, who
was a Minister, told me; and also
protested that his mother told it him

               <p>Murder doth often follow
indeed, as that which is the fruit of
this sin: but sometimes God brings
even these Adulterers, and Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resses
to shameful ends. I heard of
<note place="margin">☞</note> one (I think, a Doctor of Physick)
and his Whore, who had had three
or four Bastards betwixt them, and
had murdered them all, but at last
themselves were hanged for it, in or
near to <hi>Colchester.</hi> It came out after
this manner: The Whore was so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
in her conscience about it, that
she could not be quiet untill she had
made it known: Thus God many times
makes the actors of wickedness their
own accusers, and brings them by
their own tongues to condigne punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for their own sins.</p>

I was once in the presence of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
a married woman, that lay
sick of the sickness whereof she

for the sin of Uncleanness,
which she had often committed with

               <p>Verily so they doe. But
yet that which makes the whole
more dreadful, is, That men are
given up to this sin, because they
are abhorred of God, and because
abhorred, therefore they shall fall
into the commission of it; and shall
live there. <hi>The mouth</hi> (that is, the

               <p>True. But suppose, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of all these Judgments, this sin
had attending of it all the felicities
of this life, and no bitterness, shame,
or disgrace mixed with it, yet one
hour in Hell will spoil all. O!
this Hell, Hell-fire, Damnation in
Hell, it is such an inconceivable pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
that were it but throughly
believed, it would nip this sin, with
others, in the head. But here is the
mischief, those that give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to these things, do so harden
themselves in Unbelief and Atheism
about the things, the punishments that
God hath threatned to inflict upon
the committers of them, that at last
they arrive to, almost, an absolute
and firm belief that there is no Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to come hereafter: Else they
would not, they could not, no not
attempt to commit this sin, by such
abominable language as some do.</p>
               <p>I heard of one that should say to
his Miss, when he tempted her to
the committing of this sin, <hi>If thou</hi> ☜

                  <hi>I will venture

say, when he was tempting of
a Maid to commit uncleanness with


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48337:61"/>
him, (it was in <hi>Olivers</hi> dayes) That
if she did prove with Child, he
would tell her how she might escape
punishment, (and that was then
somewhat severe,) Say (saith he)
when you come before the Judge,
☜ <hi>That you are with Child by the Holy
Ghost.</hi> I heard him say thus, and
it greatly afflicted me; I had a
mind to have accused him for it
before some Magistrate; but he
was a great man, and I was poor,
and young: so I let it alone, but it
troubled me very much.</p>

There was none of the men of the

               <p>5. <hi>Joseph</hi> was a young man, full

says thus to such an one:</hi>
Thou wicked one, thou lovest not me,

               <p>It is one of the saddest to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens

such kind of persons: And that for
several reasons.</p>
               <p>1. Such an one, by this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is put out out of the way, and
from under the means which ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
are made use of to do good to
the soul.<note place="margin">Gen. 18. 18, 19.</note> For a Family where God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
is professed, and practised, is


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48337:64"/>
Gods Ordinance, the place which he
has appointed to teach young ones
the way and fear of God. Now to
be put out of such a Family into a
bad, a wicked one, as Mr. <hi>Badman</hi>
was, must needs be in Judgment,
and a sign of the anger of God. For
in ungodly Families men learn to
forget God, to hate goodness, and
to estrange themselves from the
wayes of those that are good.</p>
               <p>2. In Bad Families, they have
continually fresh Examples, and also
incitements to evil, and fresh encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
to it too. Yea moreover,
in such places evil is commended,
praised, well-spoken of, and they
that do it, are applauded; and this,
to be sure, is a drowning Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>3. Such places are the very haunts
and Walks of the infernal Spirits,
who are continually poysoning the
Cogitations and Minds of one or
other in such Families, that they may
be able to poyson others. Therefore
observe it, usually in wicked Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
some one, or two, are more
arch for wickedness then are any
other that are there. Now such


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48337:65"/>
are Satans Conduit-pipes; for by
them he conveighs of the spawn of
Hell, through their being crafty
in wickedness, into the Ears and
Souls of their Companions. Yea,
and when they have once conceived
wickedness, they travel with it, as
doth a woman with Child, till they
have brought it forth; <hi>Behold, he
travelleth with iniquity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 7. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>and hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
mischief, and brought forth

the Devil, who is the Father, and

               <p>I will assure you, 'tis as I say.
For you must know, that <hi>Badmans</hi>

gains. Could he have done as the
Damsel that we read of <hi>Acts</hi> 16.<note place="margin">* Acts 16. 16</note>
did, to wit, fill his Masters Purse
with his badness, he had certainly
been his <hi>White-boy,</hi> but it was not

though his Master and he did
suit well enough in the main, yet
in <hi>this</hi> and that <hi>point</hi> they differed.
<note n="†" place="margin">Reasons of their disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing.</note> Young <hi>Badman</hi> was for neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his Masters business, for going
to the Whore-house, for beguiling

his Daughters, and the like:
No marvel then if they disagreed
in these points. Not so much for
that his Master had an antipathy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the fact it self, for he could

do so when he was an Apprentice;
but for that his servant by his sin
made spoil of his Commodities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and so damnified his Master.</p>
               <p>Had (as I said before) young

tendency to his Masters advantage;
as could he have sworn, lied, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sened,
cheated, and defrauded custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers

that that Maids master would have

No, I'le warrant you; she might

he had known better how to

perhaps, have better considered with

we are at taking good counsel our

suppose that Mr. <hi>Badmans</hi> Father

what had he bettered either himself

               <p>That's true, but it doth not

as you suppose.<note place="margin">This is to be considered.</note> But if he had done as

               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>He had done bad enough,

that young <hi>Badman</hi> had taken a

gone beyond Sea, and his Father


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48337:70"/>
had neither seen him, nor heard of
him more. Or suppose that of a mad
and headstrong stomach he had gone
to the High-way for money, and so
had brought himself to the Gallows,
and his Father and Family to great
contempt, or if by so doing he had
not brought himself to that end, yet
he had added to all his wickedness,
such and such evils besides: And
what comfort could his Father have
had in this?</p>
               <p>Besides, when his Father had done
for him what he could, with desire
to make him an honest man, he
would then, whether his son had

down his head with far more peace,

for a bad Child, and that Child shall
prove never the better, he will lie
down with far more peace, than if
through severity, he had driven him
to inconveniencies.</p>
               <p>I remember that I have heard of a
good woman, that had (as this old
man) a bad and ungodly<note n="*" place="margin">A good woman and her bad son.</note> son, and
she prayed for him, counselled him,
and carried it Motherly to him for
several years together; but still he
remained bad. At last, upon a
time, after she had been at prayer,
as she was wont, for his conversion,
she comes to him, and thus, or to
this effect, begins again to admonish
him. <hi>Son,</hi> said she, <hi>Thou hast been
and art a wicked Child, thou hast cost
me many a prayer and tear, and yet
thou remainest wicked. Well, I have
done my duty, I have done what I
can to save thee; now I am satisfied,
that if I shall see thee damned at the
day of Judgment, I shall be so far off
from being grieved for thee, that I
shall rejoyce to hear the sentence of thy
damnation at that day:</hi> And it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted

               <p>I tell you, that if Parents carry it

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48337:71"/>
mixing their Mercies with loving
Rebukes, and their loving Rebukes
with Fatherly and Motherly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passions,
they are more likely to
save their Children, than by being
churlish and severe toward them:
but if they do not save them, if
their mercy doth them no good, yet
it will greatly ease them at the day
of death, to consider; I have done
by love as much as I could, to save
and deliver my child from Hell.</p>

God will bring him to Judgment;<note place="margin">Eccle. 11, 9.</note>

you must think, most like himself

They would be borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

drew away that little that his father

The thing was this: A Wife he
wanted, or rather Money; for as
for a woman, he could have Whores
enow at his whistle. But, as I said,
he wanted Money, and that must
be got by a Wife,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Badman</hi> has a godly Maid in his eye.</note> or no way; nor
could he so easily get a Wife nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
except he became an Artist
at the way of dissembling; nor
would dissembling do among that
people that could dissemble as well
as he.<note place="margin">He seeks to get her, why, and how.</note> But there dwelt a Maid not
far from him, that was both godly,
and one that had a good Portion,
but how to get her, there lay all the
craft. Well,<note place="margin">He calls his Companions together, and they advise him how to get her.</note> he calls a Council of
some of his most trusty and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Companions, and breaks his
mind to them; to wit, that he had
a mind to marry: and he also told
them to whom; But, said he, how
shall I accomplish my end, she is
Religious, and I am not? Then
one of them made reply, saying,
Since she is Religious, you must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to be so likewise, and that for
some time before you go to her:
Mark therefore whither she goes
daily to hear, and do you go thither
also; but there you must be sure to


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48337:74"/>
behave your self soberly, and make
as if you liked the Word wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
well; stand also where she may
see you, and when you come home,
be sure that you walk the street very
soberly, and go within sight of her:
This done for a while, then go to
her, and first talk of how sorry
you are for your sins, and shew great
love to the Religion that she is of;
still speaking well of her Preachers
and of her godly acquaintance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing
your hard hap, that it was
not your lot to be acquainted with
her and her fellow-Professors sooner;
and this is the way to get her. Also
you must write down Sermons, talk
of Scriptures, and protest that you
came a wooing to her, only because
she is Godly, and because you should
count it your greatest happiness if
you might but have such an one:
As for her Money, slight it, it will
be never the further off, that's the
way to come soonest at it, for she
will be jealous at first that you come
for her Money; you know what
she has, but make not a word about
it. Do this, and you shall see if you
do not intangle the Lass.</p>

                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:48337:74"/>
Thus was the snare laid for this

as if he had been for Honesty and

observed all his points, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the advice of his Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
and quickly obtained her too;
for natural parts he had, he was tall,
and fair, and had plain, but very
good Cloaths on his back; and his
Religion was the more easily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained;
for he had seen something
in the house of his Father, and first
Master, and so could the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
put himself into the Form and
Shew thereof.</p>
               <p>So he appointed his day,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Badmans</hi> comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his lying com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement.</note> and went
to her, as that he might easily do, for
she had neither father nor mother to
oppose. Well, when he was come,
and had given her a civil Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to let her understand why he
was come, then he began and told


<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48337:75"/>
her, That he had found in his heart
a great deal of love to her Person;
and that, of all the Damosels in the
world he had pitched upon her, if she
thought fit, to make her his beloved
wife. The reasons, as he told her,
why he had pitched upon her were,
her Religious and personal Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
and therefore intreated her to
take his condition into her tender
and loving consideration. As for the
world, quoth he, I have a very good
trade, and can maintain my self and
Family well, while my wife sits still
on her seat; I have got thus, and thus
much already, and feel money come
in every day, but that is not the thing
that I aim at, 'tis an honest and godly
Wife. Then he would present her
with a good Book or two, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how much good he had got by
them himself. He would also be
often speaking well of godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
especially of those that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
she liked, and loved most. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
he would be often telling of
her, what a godly Father he had, and
what a new man he was also become
himself; and thus did this treacherous
Dealer, deal with this honest and


<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48337:75"/>
good Girl, to her great grief and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,

               <p>Her Father and Mother

was but the beginning of badness,
for other evils came on apace; as
for instance: it was but a little while
after he was married, but he hangs
his Religion upon the hedge, or
rather dealt with it as men deal
with their old Cloths, who cast
them off, or leave them to others
to wear, for his part he would be
Religions no longer.</p>
               <p>Now therefore he had pulled off
his Vizzard, and began to shew
himself in his old shape, a base, wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
debauched fellow, (and now
the poor woman saw that she was
betrayed indeed;) now also his old


<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48337:78"/>
Companions begin to flock about
him, and to haunt his house and
Shop as formerly: And who with
them but Mr. <hi>Badman?</hi> and who
with him again but they?</p>
               <p>Now those good people that used
to company with his Wife,<note place="margin">He drives good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany from his wife.</note> began
to be amated and discouraged; also
he would frown and gloat upon
them, as if he abhorred the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of them: so that in little
time he drove all good company
from her, and made her s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t solitary
by her self.<note place="margin">He goes to his Whores.</note> He also began now to
go out a nights to those Drabs
who were his Familiars before, with
whom he would stay somtimes till
midnight, and sometimes till almost
morning, and then would come home
as drunk as a Swine; and this was
the course of Mr. <hi>Badman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, when he came home in
this case, if his wife did but speak
a word to him, about where he
had been, and why he had so abused
himself,<note place="margin">He rails at his wife.</note> though her words were spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in never so much meekness and
love, then she was Whore, and
Bitch, and Jade; and 'twas well if
she miss'd his fingers and heels.


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48337:79"/>
Sometimes also he would bring his
Puncks home to his house, and wo
be to his wife when they were gone,
if she did not entertain them with
all varieties possible, and also carry
it lovingly to them.</p>
               <p>Thus this good woman was made
by <hi>Badman</hi> her Husband, to possess
nothing but disappointments as to
all that he had promised her, or that
she hoped to have at his hands.</p>
               <p>But that that added pressing
weight to all her sorrow,<note place="margin">He seeks to force his wife from her Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> was, that,
as he had cast away all Religion
himself, so he attempted, if possible,
to make her do so too. He would
not suffer her to go out to the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Word of Christ, nor to
the rest of his Appointments, for the
health and salvation of her Soul: he
would now taunt at,<note place="margin">He mocks at her Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> and reflecting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
speak of her Preachers; and
would receive, yea raise scandals
of them, to her very great grief and
affliction.</p>
               <p>Now she scarce durst go to an
honest Neighbours house, or have
a good Book in her hand; specially
when he had his companions in his
house, or had got a little drink in


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48337:79"/>
his head. He would also, when he
perceived that she was dejected,
speak tauntingly,<note place="margin">He mocks his wife in her dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> and mockingly to
her in the presence of his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
calling of her his Religious
Wife, his demure Dame, and the
like; also he would make a sport
of her among his wanton ones a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>
               <p>If she did ask him (as sometimes
she would) to let her go out to a
Sermon,<note place="margin">He refuses to let her go out to good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</note> he would in a currish man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
reply, <hi>Keep at home, keep at

If she still urged that he would let
her goe, then he would say to her,
<hi>Goe if you dare.</hi> He would also
charge her with giving of what he
had to her Ministers, when, vile
wretch, he had spent it on his vain
Companions before.</p>
               <p>This was the life that Mr. <hi>Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>

               <p>Yes: There is the Law of
God, that forbiddeth marriage with
unbelievers. These kind of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
also are condemned even by
<hi>irrational</hi> creatures. 1. It is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
by the Law of God both in the
Old Testament and in the New.
1. In the Old.<note place="margin">Deut. 7. 4, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou shalt not make
Marriages with them; Thy daughter
thou shalt not give unto his son, nor
his daughter shalt thou take unto thy
son,</hi> Deut. 7. 4, 5. 2. In the New
Testament it is forbidden.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>Be not

               </p>
               <p>Here now is a prohibition, plainly
forbidding the Believer to marry
with the Unbeliever, therefore they
should not do it. Again, these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
Marriages, are, as I
may so say, condemned by <hi>irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
creatures, who will not couple
but with their own sort: Will the


<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48337:83"/>
                  <hi>Sheep</hi> couple with a <hi>Dog,</hi> the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge</hi>
with a <hi>Crow,</hi> or the <hi>Feasant</hi>
with an <hi>Owl?</hi> No, they will strictly
tye up themselves to those of their
own sort only: Yea, it sets all the
world a wondring, when they see
or hear the contrary. Man only is
most subject to wink at, and allow
of these unlawful mixtures of men
and women; Because man only is
a sinful Beast, a sinful Bird, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he, above all, will take upon
him by rebellious actions to answer,
or rather to oppose and violate the
Law of his God and Creator; nor
shall these, or other Interogatories,
[<hi>What fellowship? what concord?
what agreement? what communion</hi>
can there be in such Marriages?]
be counted of weight, or thought
worth the answering by him.</p>
               <p>But further.<note place="margin">If you love your Sou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s take heed.</note> The dangers that
such do commonly run themselves
into, should be to others a disswasive
argument to stop them from doing
the like: for besides the distresses of
Mr. <hi>Badmans</hi> wife, many that have
had very hopefull beginnings for
heaven, have by vertue of the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
that have attended these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull


<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48337:84"/>
marriages, miserably and
fearfully miscarried. Soon after such
marriages, Conviction (the first step
toward heaven) hath ceased; Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
(the next step toward Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven)
hath ceased; Hungrings and
thirstings after salvation (another
step towards the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven)
have ceased. In a word, such
marriages have estranged them from
the Word, from their godly and
faithful Friends, and have brought
them again into carnal company,
among carnal Friends, and also into
carnal Delights, where, and with
whom they have in conclusion both
sinfully abode, and miserably pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished.</p>
               <p>And this is one reason why God

harken to her voice. Now that
Child she had the opportunity to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
in the Principles of Christian
Religion, and it became a very
gracious child. But that child Mr.
<hi>Badman</hi> could not abide, he would
seldom afford it a pleasant word,
but would scowl and frown upon it,
speak churlishly and doggedly to it,
and though as to Nature it was the
most feeble of the seven, yet it
oftenest felt the weight of its Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
fingers. Three of his Children


<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48337:85"/>
did directly follow his steps, and
began to be as vile as (in his youth)
he was himself. The other that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
became a kind of mungrel
Professors, not so <hi>bad</hi> as their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
nor so <hi>good</hi> as their Mother,
but were betwixt them both. They
had their Mothers <hi>Notions,</hi> and their
Fathers <hi>Actions,</hi> and were much like
those that you read of in the Book
of <hi>Nehemiah;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nehem. 13. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>These children spake

               <p>What you say in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
is observable, and if I take not
my mark amiss, it often happeneth
after this manner where such unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Marriages are contracted.</p>

            <sp>

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe strive for the Children that God doth give them.</note> and
the reason, with respect to their
Parents, is this: Where the one of
the Parents is godly, and the other
ungodly and vile, (though they can
agree in begetting of Children, yet)
they strive for their Children when
they are born. The godly Parent
strives for the child, and by Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Counsel and good Examples,


<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48337:85"/>
labours to make it holy in body and
soul, and so fit for the Kingdom of
Heaven; but the 'ungodly would
have it like himself, wicked and
base and sinful; and so they both
give instructions accordingly: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
did I say? yea, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
too, according to their minds.
Thus the godly, as <hi>Hannah,</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
her <hi>Samuel</hi> unto the Lord:
but the ungodly, like them that
went before them, are for offering
their Children to <hi>Moloch,</hi> to an Idol,
to sin, to the Devil, and to Hell.
Thus one harkeneth to the Law of
their Mother, and is preserved from
destruction, but as for the other,
as their Fathers did, so do they.
Thus did Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> and his wife
part some of their Children betwixt
them; but as for the other three
that were as 'twere Mungrels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
both, they were like unto
those that you read of in <hi>Kings,
They feared the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 King. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>but served
their own Idols.</hi> They had, as I said,
their Mothers Notions, and I will
adde, Profession too; but their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Lusts, and something of his
Life. Now their Father did not like


<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48337:86"/>
them, because they had their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
tongue; and the Mother did
not like them because they had still
their Fathers heart and life; nor
were they indeed fit company for
good or bad. The Good would
not trust them because they were
<hi>bad,</hi> the Bad would not trust them
because they were <hi>good, viz.</hi> The
good would not trust them because
they were bad in their Lives, and
the bad would not trust them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were good in their
Words: So they were forced with
<hi>Esau</hi> to joyn in affinity with <hi>Ish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mad;</hi>
to wit, to look out a people
that were Hypocrites like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and with them they matcht,
and lived and died.</p>

               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>We may not by any
means object against God: yet we
may talk of the advantages, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages
that Children have by
having for their Parents such as are
either Godly, or the contary.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>You say right, we may so,
and pray now, since we are about it,
speak something in brief unto it, that
is, unto this; What advantage those
Children have above others, that have
for their Parents such as indeed are
Godly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>So I will,<note place="margin">The advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages that Children have, whose Parents are both godly.</note> only I must first
premise these two or three things.</p>
               <p>1. They have not the advantage
of <hi>Election</hi> for their fathers sakes.</p>
               <p>2. They are born, as others, the
<hi>children of wrath,</hi> though they come
of Godly Parents.</p>
               <p>3. Grace comes not unto them
as an Inheritance, because they have
Godly Parents. These things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
I shall now proceed.</p>
               <p>1. The children of Godly Parents
are the children of many Prayers:
they are prayed for before, and
Prayed for after they are born, and
the Prayer of a godly Father and
godly Mother doth much.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:48337:87"/>
2. They have the advantage of
what restraint is possible, from
what evils their Parents see them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable
to, and that is a second mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
               <p>3. They have the advantage of
Godly instruction, and of being told
which be, and which be not the right
ways of the Lord.</p>
               <p>4. They have also those ways
commended unto them, and spoken
well of in their hearing, that are
good.</p>
               <p>5. Such are also, what may be,
kept out of evil company, from evil
Books, and from being taught the
way of Swearing, Lying, and the
like, as Sabbath-breaking, and moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
at good men, and good things,
and this is a very great mercy.</p>
               <p>6. They have also the benefit of a
godly life set before them doctrinal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by their Parents, and that doctrine
backt with a godly and holy exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
and all these are very great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages.</p>
               <p>Now all these advantages,<note place="margin">The disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that the Children of ungodly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent have.</note> the
children of ungodly Parents want;
and so are more in danger of being
carried away with the error of the


<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48337:87"/>
wicked. For ungodly Parents nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Pray for their Children, nor do,
nor can they heartily instruct them;
they do not after a godly manner
restrain them from evil, nor do
they keep them from evil company.
They are not grieved at, nor yet do
they forewarn their children to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of such evil actions that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination
to God, and to all good
men. They let their children break
the Sabbath, swear, lye, be wicked
and vain. They commend not to
their children an holy life, nor set a
good example before their eyes.
No, they do in all things contrary:
Estranging of their children what
they can, from the love of God and
all good men, so soon as they are
born. Therefore it is a very great
Judgment of God upon children to
be the Offspring of base and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men.<note place="margin">Job. 30. 8.</note>

               <p>Well, but before we leave
Mr. <hi>Badmans</hi> wife and children, I
have a mind, if you please, to enquire
a little more after one thing, the
which I am sure you can satisfie me
in.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>What is that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:48337:88"/>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>You said a while ago, that
this Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> would not suffer
his wife to go out to hear such godly
Ministers as she liked, but said if she
did, she had as good never come home
any more. Did he often carry it thus
to her?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>He did say so, he did often
say so. This I told you then, and
had also then told you more, but
that other things put me out.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>Well said, pray therefore
now go on.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>So I will. Upon a time,
she was on a Lords day for going to
hear a Sermon, and Mr. <hi>Badman</hi>
was unwilling she should: but she
at that time, as it seems, did put on
more courage than she was wont;
and therefore, after she had spent
upon him, a great many fair words
and entreaties,<note place="margin">A contest betwixt Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> and his wife.</note> if perhaps she might
have prevailed by them, but all to
no purpose at all: At last she said
she would go, and rendred this
reason for it; I have an Husband,
but also a God; my God has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me, and that upon pain of
damnation, to be a continual Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipper
of him, and that in the way


<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48337:88"/>
of his own Apppointments: I have
an Husband, but also a Soul, and my
Soul ought to be more unto me, than
all the world besides. This soul of
mine I will look after, care for, and
(if I can) provide it an Heaven for
its habitation. You are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to love me,<note place="margin">Ephes. 5. 28.</note> as you love your own
body, and so do I love you; but I tell
you true, I preferr my Soul before
all the world, and its Salvation I will
seek.</p>
               <p>At this,<note place="margin">With what weapons <hi>Badman</hi> did deal with his wife.</note> first, he gave her an ugly
wish, and then fell into a fearfull
rage, and sware moreover that if she
did go, he would make both her, and
all her damnable Brotherhood (for
so he was pleased to call them) to
repent their coming thither.</p>

by that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>You may easily guess what
he meant: he meant, he would
turn Informer, and so either weary
out those that she loved, from meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together to Worship God; or
make them pay dearly for their so
doing; the which if he did, he knew
it would vex every vein of her ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
heart.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:48337:89"/>

               <p>But do you think Mr. <hi>Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
would have been so base?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>Truly he had malice, and
enmity enough in his heart to do it,
onely he was a Tradesman; also he
knew that he must live by his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and so he had that little wit
in his anger, that he refrained him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and did it not. But, as I said,
he had malice and envy enough in
his heart to have made him to do it,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> heart discovered as to its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity against the friends of his wife.</note>
only he thought it would worst him
in his trade: yet these three things
he would be doing.</p>
               <p>1. He would be putting of others
on to molest and abuse her friends.</p>
               <p>2. He would be glad when he
heard that any mischief befell them.</p>
               <p>3. And would laught at her, when
he saw her troubled for them. And
now I have told you Mr. <hi>Badmans</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>But was he not afraid of

            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>He regarded not the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <p>In our Town there was one
<hi>W. S.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark.</note> a man of a very wicked life;<note place="margin">☜</note>
and he, when there seemed to be
countenance given to it, would needs
turn Informer. Well, so he did,
and was as diligent in his business as
most of them could be; he would
watch a nights, climb Trees, and
range the Woods a days, if possible,
to find out the Meeters, for then they
were forced to meet in the Fields:
yea, he would curse them bitterly,
and swear most fearfully what he
would do to them when he found


<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48337:90"/>
them. Well, after he had gone on
like a Bedlam in his course a while,
and had done some mischiefs to the
people, he was stricken by the hand
of God, and that in this manner.</p>
               <p>1. Although he had his tongue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
at will, now he was taken
with a faultering in his speech, and
could not for weeks together speak
otherwise, than just like a man that
was drunk.</p>
               <p>2. Then he was taken with a
drauling, or slabbering at his mouth,
which slabber sometimes would hang
at his mouth well nigh half way
down to the ground.</p>
               <p>3. Then he had such a weakness
in the back sinews of his Neck, that
oft times he could not look up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, unless he clapped his
hand hard upon his forehead, and
held up his head that way, by
strength of hand.</p>
               <p>4. After this his speech went quite
away, and he could speak no more
than a Swine or a Bear. Therefore,
like one of them, he would gruntle
and make an ugly noyse, according
as he was offended, or pleased, or
would have any thing done, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:48337:90"/>
In this posture he continued for the
space of half a year, or thereabouts,
all the while otherwise well, and
could go about his business, save
once that he had a fall from the Bell
as it hangs in our Steeple, which
'twas a wonder it did not kill him:
But after that he also walked about,
till God had made him a sufficient
spectacle of his Judgment for his sin,
and then on a sudden he was stricken
and dyed miserably: and so there
was an end of him and his doings.</p>

an Informer he was, and did much
distress some people, and had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
his Informations so effectually
against some, that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
further to do, but for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stables
to make distress on the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that he might have the Money
or Goods; and as I heard, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened
them much to do it. Now
while he was in the heat of his work,
as he stood one day by the Fire-side,
he had (it should seem) a mind to a


<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48337:91"/>
Sop in the Pan, (for the Spit was
then at the fire,) so he went to make
him one; but behold, a Dog (some
say his own Dog) took distaste at
something, and bit his Master by
the Leg; the which bite, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all the means that was used
to cure him, turned (as was said)
to a Gangrene; however, that
wound was his death, and that a
dreadful one too: for my Relator
said, that he lay in such a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by this bite, (as the beginning)
till his flesh rotted from off him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he went out of the world.
But what need I instance in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
persons, when the Judgement
of God against this kind of people
was made manifest, I think I may
say, if not in all, yet in most of the
Counties in <hi>England</hi> where such
poor Creatures were. But I would,
if it had been the will of God, that
neither I nor any body else, could
tell you more of these Stories: True
stories, that are neither <hi>Lye,</hi> nor
<hi>Romance.</hi>

               <p>Well, I also heard of both
these my self, and of more too, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
in their kind as these, if


<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48337:91"/>
I had any list to tell them; but let
us leave those that are behind to
others, or to the coming of Christ,
who then will justifie or condemn them
as the merit of their work shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire;
or if they repented, and found
mercy, I shall be glad when I know
it, for I wish not a curse to the Soul
of mine Enemy.</p>

               <p>There can be no pleasure

to hear of them may do us a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
They may put us in mind that
there is a God that judgeth in the
earth, and that doth not alwayes
forget nor deferre to hear the Crye
of the destitute; They also carry
along with them both Caution and
Counsel to those that are the survi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of such. Let us tremble at the
Judgements of God, and be afraid
of sinning against him, and it shall
be our protection. It shall go well
with them that fear God, that fear
before him.</p>

               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>Well Sir, as you have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated,
so I think we have in this
place spoken enough about these kind
of men; if you please, let us return
again to Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> himself, if


<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48337:92"/>
you have any more to say of him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>More! we have yet scarce
throughly begun with <hi>Any thing</hi>
that we have said. All the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
are in themselves so full of bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that we have rather only look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in them, than indeed said any
thing to them: but we will pass
them, and proceed. You have heard
of the sins of his Youth, of his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentiship,
and how he set up, and
married, and what a life he hath
led his wife; and now I will tell
you some more of his pranks.<note place="margin">New dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of Mr. <hi>Badman.</hi>
                  </note> He
had the very knack of Knavery;
had he, as I said before, been bound
to serve an Apprentiship to all these
things, he could not have been
more cunning, he could not have
been more artificial at it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>Nor perhaps so artificially
neither. For as none can teach Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
like to God himself, so concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sin and Knavery, none can teach
a man it like the Devil, to whom, as
I perceive, Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> went to
School from his Childhood to the end
of his life. But pray Sir, make a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>Well so I will. You may


<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48337:92"/>
remember that I told you what a
condition he was in for Money be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he did marry, and how he got
a rich Wife, with whose Money he
paid his debts: Now when he had
paid his debts, he having some
Moneys left, he sets up again as
briskly as ever, keeps a great Shop,
drives a great Trade, and runs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
a great way into debt;<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> plays a new prank.</note> but
now not into the debt of one or
two, but into the debt of many, so
that at last he came to owe some
thousands; and thus he went on a
good while. And to pursue his ends
the better, he began now to study
to please all men, and to suit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to any company; he could now
<hi>be</hi> as they, <hi>say</hi> as they, that is, if
he listed; and then he <hi>would</hi> list,
when he perceived that by so doing,
he might either make them his
Customers or Creditors for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.
If he dealt with honest
men, (as with some honest men he
did) then he would be as they;
talk as they, seem to be sober as
they, talk of Justice and Religion
as they, and against Debauchery as
they; yea, and would too seem to


<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48337:93"/>
shew a dislike of them that said,
did, or were otherwise than honest.</p>
               <p>Again, when he did light among
those that were <hi>bad,</hi> then he would
be as they, but yet more close and
cautiously, except he were sure of
his company: Then he would carry
it openly, be as they; say, <hi>Damn 'em</hi>
and <hi>Sink 'em,</hi> as they. If they rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on Good men, so could he; if
they railed on Religion, so could
he:<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</note> if they talked beastly, vainly,
idlely, so would he; if they were
for drinking, swearing, whoring,
or any the like Villanies, so was he.
This was now the path he trod in,
and could do all artificially, as any
man alive. And now he thought
himself a perfect man, he thought
he was always a Boy till now.
What think you now of Mr. <hi>Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man?</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>Think! why, I think he
was an Atheist: For no man but an
Atheist can do this. I say, it cannot
be, but that the man that is such as
this Mr. <hi>Badman,</hi> must be a rank and
stinking Atheist; for he that believes
that there is either God or Devil,
Heaven or Hell, or Death, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment


<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48337:93"/>
after, cannot doe as Mr. <hi>Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
did; I mean, if he could do these
things without reluctancy and check
of Conscience; yea, if he had not sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and remorse for such abominable
sins as these.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, he was so far off from
reluctancies and remorse of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
for these things, that he count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them the excellency of his Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the quintessence of his Wit,
his rare and singular vertues, such
as but few besides himself could be
the Masters of. Therefore, as for
those that made boggle and stop
at things, and that could not in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and for fear of Death and
Judgement, do such things as he;
he would call them Fools and Nod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and charge them for being
frighted with the talk of unseen Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears;
and would encourage them,
if they would be men indeed, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
after the attainment of this his
excellent art. He would often-times
please himself with the thoughts of
what he could do in this matter,
saying within himself;<note place="margin">How Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> came to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy himself.</note> I can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,

and speak against swearing; I can

and not be troubled for it:
Now I enjoy my self, and am Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of mine own wayes, and not

with much study, great care, and

I believe that at times God
did let down fire from Heaven into

his Conscience. True, I believe he
would quickly put it out again, and
grow more desperate and wicked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward,
but this also turned to his
destruction, as afterward you may
hear.</p>
               <p>But I am not of your mind, to
think that there are but few such in
the world; except you mean as to
the Degree of wickedness unto
which he had attained. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
no doubt,<note n="*" place="margin">There are abundance like Mr. <hi>Badman.</hi>
                  </note> there is abundance
of such as he: men of the same mind,
of the same principles, and of the

into practice. Yea, I believe that
there are many that are endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to attain to the same pitch of
wickedness; and all them are such
as he, in the Judgment of the Law;
nor will their want of hellish wit
to attain thereto, excuse them at
the day of Judgment. You know
that in all Science, some are more
arch than some; and so it is in the
art, as well as in the practice of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness:
some are two fold, and some
seven-fold more the children of Hell
than others, (and yet all the children
of Hell,) else they would all be <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi>


                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:48337:95"/>
and none <hi>scholars</hi> in the school
of wickedness. But there must be
Masters, and there must be Learners;
Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> was a master in this art,

be an arch and chief one in that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.</p>

               <p>You are in the right, for I
perceive that some men, though they
desire it, cannot be so arch in the
practice thereof as others, but are (as I
suppose they call them) fools and dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to the rest, their heads and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities
will not serve them to act and
do so wickedly. But Mr. <hi>Badman</hi>
wanted not a wicked head to contrive,
as well as a wicked heart to do his
wickedness.</p>

life, and keep up his Trade and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
(such as he had) in the world;
but by the new Engine of <hi>Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
Wherefore, upon a time, he
gives a great, and sudden<note n="†" place="margin">How he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged things in order to his breaking.</note> rush
into several mens debts, to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of about four or five thousand
pound, driving at the same time
a very great trade, by selling many
things for less than they cost him,
to get him custom, therewith to blind
his Creditors eyes. His Creditors
therefore seeing that he had a great
employ, and dreaming that it must
needs at length turn to a very good
account to them, trusted him freely
without mistrust, and so did others
too, to the value of what was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
before. Well, when Mr. <hi>Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
had well feathered his Nest with
other mens goods and money, after
a little time<note n="†" place="margin">He breaks.</note> 
                  <hi>he breaks.</hi> And by
and by it is noysed abroad that Mr.
<hi>Badman</hi> had shut up Shop, was gone,


<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48337:98"/>
and could trade no longer. Now,
by that time his breaking was come
to his Creditors ears, he had by Craft
and Knavery made so sure of what
he had, that his Creditors could not
touch a penny. Well, when he
had done, he sends his mournfull su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered
letters to his Creditors, to let
them understand what had happened
unto him, and desired them not to
be severe with him;<note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> suger words to his Creditors.</note> for he bore
towards all men an honest mind, and
would pay so far as he was able.
Now he sends his letters by a man
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Badmans</hi> friend.</note> confederate with him, who could
make both the worst, and best of
Mr. <hi>Badmans</hi> case: The best for Mr.
<hi>Badman,</hi> and the worst for his Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.
So when he comes to them,
he both bemoans them, and condoles
Mr. <hi>Badmans</hi> condition: Telling
of them, that without a speedy bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of things to a conclusion, Mr.
<hi>Badman</hi> would be able to make
them no satisfaction, but at present
he both could, and would, and that
to the utmost of his power: and to
that end, he desired that they would
come over to him. Well, his Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
appoint him a time, and come


<pb n="167" facs="tcp:48337:98"/>
over; and he, mean while, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizes
another to treat with them,
but will not be seen himself, unless
it was on a <hi>Sunday,</hi> lest they should
snap him with a Writ. So his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
friend treats with them about
their concern with Mr. <hi>Badman,</hi> first
telling them of the great care that
Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> took to satisfie them
and all men for whatsoever he ought,
as far as in him lay, and, how little
he thought a while since to be in
this low condition. He pleaded also
the greatness of his Charge, the
greatness of Taxes, the Badness
of the times, and the great Losses
that he had by many of his custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
some of which died in his
debt, others were run away, and
for many that were alive, he never
expected a farthing from them. Yet
nevertheless he would shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
an honest man, and would pay
as far as he was able; and if they
were willing to come to terms, he
would make a composition with
them, (for he was not able to pay
them all.)<note place="margin">What Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> propounds to his Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</note> The Creditors asked what
he would give? 'Twas replyed, <hi>Half

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48337:99"/>
began to <hi>huff,</hi> and he to renew his
complaint and entreaty; but the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
would not hear, and so for that
time their meeting without success
broke up. But after his Creditors
were in cool blood, and admitting of
second thoughts, and fearing lest
delays should make them lose all,
they admit of a second debate, come
together again, and by many words,
and great ado,<note place="margin">They at last agree, and Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> gains by breaking,</note> they obtained <hi>five
shillings i'th' pound.</hi> So the money
was produced, Releases and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges
drawn, signed, and sealed,
Books crossed, and all things confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;
and then Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> can
put his head out a dores again, and
be a better man than when he shut
up Shop, by several thousands of
pounds.</p>

               </p>
               <p>1. What do you find in the Word

of Mr. <hi>Badmans</hi> is?</p>
               <p>2. What would you have a man

               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>I will answer you as well
as I can. And first to the first of your
questions: To wit,<note place="margin">1. Qestion,</note> 
                  <hi>What I find
in the Word of God against such a
practice, as this of Mr.</hi> Badmans
<hi>is.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Answ.</speaker>
               <p>The Word of God doth
forbid this wickedness; and to make
it the more odious in our eyes, it
joyns it with Theft and Robbery:
<hi>Thou shalt not,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Levit. 19. 13.</note> says God, <hi>defraud thy
neighbour, nor rob him.</hi> Thou shalt
not <hi>defraud,</hi> that is, <hi>deceive</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile.
Now thus to <hi>break,</hi> is to
<hi>defraud,</hi> deceive and beguile; which
is, as you see, forbidden by the God
of Heaven: <hi>Thou shalt not defraud thy
neighbour, nor rob him.</hi> It is a kind
of theft and robbery, thus to defraud,
and beguile. It is a wilely robbing
of his shop,<note place="margin">The hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nousnes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of this sin.</note> and picking of his poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket:
a thing odious to Reason and
Conscience, and contrary to the
Law of nature. It is a designed piece
of wickedness, and therefore a
double sin. A man cannot do this
great wickedness on a sudden, and


<pb n="172" facs="tcp:48337:101"/>
through a violent assault of Satan.
He that will commit this sin, must
have time to <hi>deliberate,</hi> that by <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention</hi>
he may make it <hi>formidable,</hi>
and that with <hi>lies</hi> and high <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulations.</hi>
He that commits this
wickedness, must first <hi>hatch</hi> it
upon his bed, beat his head about it,
and lay his plot strong: So that to
the compleating of such a wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
there must be adjoyned many
sins, and they too, must go hand
in hand untill it be compleated. But
what saith the Scripture?<note place="margin">1. Thess. 4. 6.</note>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">fair war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> 
                  <hi>Let no
man go beyond, and defraud his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in any, matter, because the Lord
is the avenger of all such.</hi> But this
kind of Breaking is a going beyond
my Brother; This is a compassing
of him about that I may catch him
in my net; and as I said, an art to
rob my Brother, and to pick his
pocket, and that with his consent.
Which doth not therefore mitigate,
but so much the more greaten and
make odious the offence. For men
that are thus wilily abused cannot
help themselves, they are taken in
a deceitfull net. But God will here
concern himself, he will be the aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,


<pb n="173" facs="tcp:48337:101"/>
he will be the avenger of all such
either here or in another world.</p>
               <p>And this, the Apostle testifies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
where he saith;<note place="margin">Colos. 3. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>But he that
doth wrong, shall recieve for the wrong
that he hath done,</hi>

                     </gap> Fair war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning again.</note> 
                  <hi>and there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of persons.</hi> That is, there is no
man, be he what he will, if he will
be guilty of this sin, of going beyond,
of beguiling of, and doing wrong to
his Brother, but God will call him
to an account for it, and will pay
him with vengeance for it too; for
there is no respect for persons.</p>
               <p>I might add, that this sin of wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
of going beyond, and defrand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of my Neighbour, it is like
that first prank that the Devil plaid
with our first Parents, (as the Altar
that <hi>Vriah</hi> built for <hi>Ahaz,</hi> was taken
from the fashion of that that stood at
<hi>Damascus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signedly commits this sin is like the Devil.</note> to be the very pattern
of it.) The Serpent beguiled me, says
<hi>Eve;</hi> Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> beguiles his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors.
The Serpent beguiled <hi>Eve</hi>
with lying promises of gain; and so
did Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> beguile his Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.
The Serpent said one thing
and meant another, when he begui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Eve;</hi> and so did Mr. <hi>Badman</hi>


                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:48337:102"/>
when he beguiled his Creditors.</p>
               <p>That man therefore that doth thus
deceive and beguile his neighbour,
imitateth the Devil; he taketh his
examples from him, and not from
God, the Word, or good men: and
this did Mr. <hi>Badman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And now to your second question:
To wit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Question.</note> What I would have a man
do, that is in his Creditors debt, and
that can neither pay him, nor go on in
a trade any longer?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Answ.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>First of all:</hi> If this be
his case, and he knows it, let him
not run one penny further in his
Creditors debt. For that cannot
be done with good conscience. <hi>He
that knowes he cannot pay, and yet
will run into debt;</hi> does knowingly
wrong and defraud his neighbour,
and falls under that sentence of the
Word of God,<note place="margin">How those that are B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>The wicked borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and payeth not again.</hi> Yea worse,
he borrows though at the very same
time he knows that he cannot pay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
He doth also craftily take away
what is his Neighbours. That is
therefore the first thing that I would
propound to such: <hi>Let him not run
any further into his Creditors debt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:48337:102"/>
Secondly,<note place="margin">Good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</note> After this, let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
how, and by what means he
was brought into such a condition,
that he could not pay his just debts.
To wit, whether it was by his own
remisness in his Calling, by living
too high in Dyet or Apparel, by lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too lavishingly that which was
none of his own, to his loss; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the immediate hand and
Judgment of God.</p>
               <p>If by searching, he findes, that
this is come upon him through re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misness
in his Calling, Extravagancies
in his Family, or the like; let him
labour for a sence of his sin and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness,
for he has sinned against
the Lord: First, in his being <hi>sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in business,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 11. 1 Tim. 5. 8.</note> and in <hi>not providing,</hi>
to wit, of his own, by the sweat of
his brows, or other honest ways,
for those of his own house. And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
in being lavishing in Dyet
and Apparel in the Family, or in
lending to others that which was
none of his own. This cannot be
done with good conscience: it is
both against reason and nature, and
therefore must be a sin against God.
I say therefore, if thus this debtor


<pb n="176" facs="tcp:48337:103"/>
hath done, if ever he would live
quietly in conscience, and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
in his condition for the future,
let him humble himself before God,
and repent of this his wickedness.
For <hi>he that is slothfull in his work,</hi>

                  <hi>is
brother to him that is a great waster.</hi>
To be slothfull and a waster too, is
to be as it were a double sinner.</p>
               <p>But again, as this man should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into these things, so he should
also into this. How came I into this
way of dealing in which I have now
miscarried? is it a way that my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
brought me up in, put me Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice
to, or that by providence
I was first thrust into? or is it a way
into which I have twisted my self,
as not being contented with my
first lot, that by God and my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
I was cast into? This ought
duly to be considered.<note n="*" place="margin">Good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

upon search, a man shall find that
he is out of the place and Calling
into which he was put by his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
or the Providence of God,
and has miscarried in a new way,
that through pride and dislike of
his first state he has chose rather
to embrace; his miscarriage is his


<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48337:103"/>
sin, the fruit of his Pride, and a token
of the Judgment of God upon him
for his leaving of his first state. And
for this he ought, as for the former,
to be humble and penitent before the
Lord.</p>
               <p>But if by search, he finds,<note place="margin">How to find that thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay came by the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, or by thy mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage.</note> that
his poverty came by none of these;

and can say with good conscience,
<hi>I went not out of my place and state
in which God by his providence had
put me; but have abode with God in
the calling wherein I was called, and
have wrought hard, and fared meanly,
been civilly apparelled, and have not
directly, nor indirectly made away
with my Creditors goods:</hi> Then has
his fall come upon him by the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
hand of God, whether by visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or invisible wayes. For some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it comes by <hi>visible</hi> wayes, to
wit, by Fire, by Thieves, by loss of
Cattel, or the wickedness of sinful
dealers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And sometimes by
means <hi>invisible,</hi> and then no man
knows how; we only see things are
going, but cannot see by what way
they go. Well, Now suppose that
a man, by an immediate hand of


<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48337:104"/>
God is brought to <hi>a morsel of Bread,

               </p>
               <p>I answer: His surest way is still
to think, that this is the fruit
of some sin, though possibly not sin in
the management of his calling, yet
of some other sin. <hi>God casteth away
the substance of the wicked.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 10. 3.</note> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

glory, and I did not to his glory
improve, as I should, that his good

lived in full and fat pasture, I did
there lift up the heel:<note place="margin">Deut. 32. 15.</note> Therefore he
will now turn me into hard Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
that with leanness, and hunger,

spend the rest of my days. But let

repining; let him do it in a godly
manner, submitting himself to the
Judgment of God.<note place="margin">James 1. 9<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>1. This is right lying down under

in Gods time: when God would

also that attend a low condition,
more than all the world are aware


<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48337:105"/>
of. A poor condition has preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

poor, because they are poor, are
not capable of sinning against God as

hath not God chosen the poor of this
world, rich in Faith, and heirs of a
Kingdom which God hath promised
to them that love him?</p>
               <p>I am perswaded, if men upon
whom this hand of God is, would
thus quietly lye down, and humble
themselves under it, they would
find more peace, yea, more blessing
of God attending them in it, than
the most of men are aware of. But
this is an hard Chapter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I do not expect that many
should either read it with pleasure,
or desire to take my counsel.</p>
               <p>Having thus spoken to the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
man, with reference to his own


<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48337:105"/>
self; I will now speak to him as he
stands related to his Creditors.</p>
               <p>In the next place therefore, let
him fall upon the most<note n="†" place="margin">Honest dealing with Creditors.</note> honest way
of dealing with his Creditors, and
that I think must be this.</p>
               <p>First, Let him timely make them
acquainted with his condition, and
also do to them these three things.</p>
               <p>1. Let him heartily, and unfeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ask them forgiveness for the
wrong that he has done them.</p>
               <p>2. Let him proffer them <hi>all,</hi> and
the whole <hi>all</hi> that ever he has in the
world; let him hide nothing, let
him strip himself to his raiment for
them; let him not keep a Ring, a
Spoon, or any thing from them.</p>
               <p>3. If none of these two will sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
them, let him proffer them his
Body, to be at their dispose, to wit,
either to abide imprisonment their
pleasure, or to be at their service, till
by labour and travel he hath made
them such amends as they in reason
think fit, (only reserving something
for the succour of his poor and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
Family out of his labour,
which in Reason, and Conscience,
and Nature, he is bound also to take


<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48337:106"/>
care of:) Thus shall he make them
what amends he is able, for the
Wrong that he hath done them
in wasting and spending of their
Estates.</p>
               <p>By thus doing, he submits him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to Gods rod, commits himself to
the dispose of his Providence; yea,
by thus doing, he casteth the lot of
his present and future condition
into the lap of his Creditors, and
leaves the whole dispose thereof to
the Lord,<note place="margin">Pro. 16. 33.</note> even as he shall order and
incline their hearrs to do with him.
And let that be either to forgive
him; or to take that which he hath
for satisfaction; or to lay his body
under affliction, this way or that,
according to Law; can he, I say,
thus leave the whole dispose to God,
let the issue be what it will, that
man shall have peace in his mind
afterward. And the comforts of
that state, (which will be comforts
that attend Equity, Justice, and
Duty,) will be more unto him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
more according to Godliness,
than can be the comforts that are
the fruits of Injustice, Fraudulency,
and Deceit. Besides, this is the


<pb n="183" facs="tcp:48337:106"/>
way to engage God to favour him
by the sentence of his Creditors;
(for <hi>He</hi> can intreat them to use him
kindly,)<note place="margin">Jer. 15. 10, 11.</note> and he will do it when his
ways are pleasing in his sight: <hi>When
a mans ways please the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 16. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
shall be at peace with him;</hi> And
surely, for a man to seek to make
restitution for wrongs done, to the
utmost of his power, by what he is,
has, and enjoys in this world, is the
best way, in that capacity, and
with reference to that thing, that
a man can at this time be found
active in.</p>
               <p>But he that doth otherwise, abides
in his sin, refuses to be disposed of
by the Providence of God, chuseth
an high Estate, though not attained
in Gods way; when Gods Will is,
that he should descend into a low
one: yea, he desperately saith in
his heart and actions, I will be
mine own chooser, and that in
mine own way, whatever happens
or follows thereupon.</p>

               <p>You have said well, in my
mind. But suppose now, that Mr.
<hi>Badman</hi> was here, could he not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
as to what you have said, saying,


<pb n="184" facs="tcp:48337:107"/>
Go and teach your Brethren, that are
Professors, this lesson, for they, as I
am, are guilty of Breaking; yea I am
apt to think, of that which you call
my Knavish way of breaking;<note place="margin">A heavy blot upon Religion.</note> to wit,
of breaking before they have need to
break. But if not so, yet they are
guilty of neglect in their Calling, of
living higher, both in Fare and
Apparrel, than their Trade or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
will maintain. Besides, that
they do break, all the world very well
knowes, and that they have the
art to plead for a composition, is very
well known to men; and that it is
usual with them, to bide their Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,
their Plate, their Jewels, and
('tis to be thought, sometimes Money
and Goods besides,) is as common as
four eggs a penny. And thus they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile
men, debauch their consciencies,
sin against their Profession, and make,
'tis to be feared, their lusts in all this,
and the fulfilling of them, their end,
I say, if Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> was here to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
thus unto you, what would be your
reply?</p>

            <sp>

God, regardeth the credit

               <p>Professors, such perhaps there

Well, to this foolish objection, let us

little conscience, if any at all that
is good, that thus objecteth against
the Text: but let us look into the
New Testament, and there we shall
see how Christ confirmeth the same:
Where he commandeth that men
make to others good measure, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
also that they make good
weight; telling such that doe thus, or
those that do it not, that they may be

shew his indignation against the false

false man to the Oppressor, and the
Extortioner shall catch from him, as

saith, <hi>When thou shalt cease to

I say, 'tis no matter how men
esteem of things, let us adhere to
the Judgment of God. And the
rather, because when we our selves
have done weighing and measuring

those that use this naughty

must confess Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> was not
so arch at the first;<note place="margin">How Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> did cheat, and hide his cheating.</note> that is, to do it
by shew of Religion; for now he
began to grow threadbare, (though
some of his brethren are arch enough

a great many of them, and never

            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>Not at all. There lay the
depth of his deceit: For if any at
any time found fault, that he used
them hardly, and that they wanted


<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48337:116"/>
their weight of things; he would
reply:<note place="margin">Good Weights and a bad Ballance a deep piece of Knavery.</note> Why did you not see them
weighed? will you not believe your
own eyes: If you question my
<hi>weights,</hi> pray carry them whether
you will, I will maintain them to be
good and just. The same he would
say of his <hi>scales.</hi> So he blinded, all,
by his <hi>Ballance.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>This is cunning indeed:
but as you say, there must be also some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
done or said, to blind therewith,
and this I perceive Mr. <hi>Badman</hi>
had.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>Yes. He had many ways
to blind, but he was never clever
at it, by making a shew of Religion,
(though he cheated his wife there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with:)
for he was, especially by
those that dwelt near him, too well
known to do that, though he would
bungle at it as well as he could.
But there are some that are arch vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains
this way; they shall to view live
a whole life Religiously, and yet
shall be guilty of these most horrible

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:48337:118"/>
but this is not considered by those
thus minded. For if they can get it,
though they get, as we say, <hi>the
Devil and all,</hi> by their getting,
yet they are content, and count
that their getting is much.</p>
               <p>Little good! Why do you think
they consider that? No: no more
than they consider what they shall
doe in the Judgment, at the day of

of what they get, and that is
just nothing at all.</p>
               <p>But to give you a more direct
answer. This kind of getting, is
so far off from doing them <hi>little</hi>
good, that it doth them <hi>no</hi> good at
all; because thereby they lose their
own souls;<note place="margin">Mar. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>What shall it profit a man
if he shall gain the whole world, and
lose his own soul?</hi> He loseth then,
he loseth greatly that getteth after
this fashion. This is the man that
is <hi>penny-wise and pound-foolish;</hi> this
is he <hi>that loseth his good Sheep for a
half pennyworth of tarr;</hi> that loseth
a soul for a little of the world. And
then what doth he get thereby, but
loss and dammage? Thus he get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
or rather loseth about the world


<pb n="207" facs="tcp:48337:118"/>
to come: But what doth he get in
this world,<note place="margin">Prov. 10. 3.</note> more than travel and
sorrow,<note place="margin">Jer. 15. 13.</note> vexation of spirit,<note place="margin">Chap. 17. 3.</note> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment?
Men aim at blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in getting, I mean, at temporal
blessedness; but the man that thus
getteth, shall not have that. For
though an Inheritance after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
may be hastily gotten at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
yet the end thereof shall
not be blessed. They gather it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and think to keep it too, but
what says <hi>Solomon?</hi> God casteth it
away. <hi>The Lord will not suffer the
soul of the righteous to famish, but he
casteth away the substance of the
wicked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The time, as I said, that they
do enjoy it, it shall doe them no
good at all; but long to be sure they
must not have it. For God will
either take it away in their life time,
or else in the generation following,
according to that of <hi>Job: He,</hi> the
wicked, <hi>may prepare it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 27. 17.</note>

getteth Sin and Wrath, Hell and

much he doth get.</p>
               <p>This, I say, is his getting; so that
as <hi>David</hi> says, we may be bold to
say too: <hi>I beheld the wicked in great
prosperity, and presently I cursed his
habitation:</hi> for it cannot prosper with
him. Fluster and huff, and make
a doe for a while he may, but God
hath determined that both <hi>he</hi> and <hi>it</hi>
shall melt like grease, and any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving

the unrighteous man in a way of

himself with thick Clay, but

count these <hi>all</hi> his bad tricks to
get money: For he had more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.</p>
               <p>If his customers were in his Books
(as it should goe hard but he would
have them there; at least, if he
thought he could make any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of them,) then, then would he
be sure to impose upon them his
worst, even very bad Comodity,
yet set down for it the price that the
best was sold at: like those that sold
the Refuse Wheat, or the worst of
the wheat; making the Sheckle great,<note place="margin">Amos 8.</note>
yet hoisting up the price: This was
Mr. <hi>Badmans</hi> way.<note n="*" place="margin">Another art to cheat withall.</note> He would sell
goods that cost him not the best
price by far, for as much as he sold
his best of all for. He had also a
trick to mingle his comodity, that
that which was bad might goe off
with the less mistrust.</p>
               <p>Besides, if his customers at any
time paid him money, let them
look to themselves, and to their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitances,
for he would usually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt


<pb n="210" facs="tcp:48337:120"/>
to call for that payment again,
specially if he thought that there was
hopes of making a prize thereby,
and then to be sure if they could not
produce good and sufficient ground
of the payment, a hundred to one
but they payed it again. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the honest Chapman would
appeal to his servants for proof of
the payment of money, but they
were trained up by him to say after
his mind, right or wrong: so
that, relief that way, he could get
none.</p>

               <p>It is a bad, yea an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable

servants. For by such means a poor

how to help himself. Alas! if the

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>Extortion is a screwing from
men more than by the Law of God
or men is right;<note place="margin">Of Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and it is committed
sometimes by them in Office, about

'tis most commonly committed by
men of Trade, who without all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
when they have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
will make a prey of their

<hi>Badman</hi> an Extortioner; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he did not exact, and force
away, as <hi>Bailiss</hi> and <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and such cruelty to make
use of them, that he would often,
in his way, be Extorting, and forcing

a prey of his advantage upon his

him more than in reason and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
according to the present

               <p>Thus you have often said
before. But now we are in discourse
of this, give me leave a little to goe
on. We have a great many people
in the Countrey too that live all their
dayes in the practice, and so under
the guilt of Extortion: people, alas!
that think scorn to be so accounted.</p>
               <p>As for Example:<note place="margin">Who are Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ioners.</note> There is a poor
body that dwells, we will suppose,
so many miles from the Market;
and this man wants a Bushel of
Grist, a pound of Butter, or a Cheese
for himself, his wife and poor chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:


<pb n="213" facs="tcp:48337:121"/>
But dwelling so far from the
Market, if he goes thither, he shall
lose his dayes work, which will be
eight pence or ten pence dammage
to him, and that is something to a
poor man. So he goeth to one of
his Masters or Dames for what he
wanteth, and asks them to help
him with such a thing: Yes, say
they, you may have it; but withall
they will give him a gripe, perhaps
make him pay as much (or more)
for it at home, as they can get
when they have carryed it five
miles to a Market, yea and that
too for the Refuse of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity.
But in this the Women
are especially faulty, in the sale of
their Butter and Cheese, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now
this is a <hi>kind</hi> of Extortion, it is a
making a prey of the necessity
of the poor, it is a grinding of
their faces, a buying and selling of
them.</p>
               <p>But above all, your <hi>Hucksters,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Hucksters.</note>
that buy up the poor mans Victuals
by whole-sale, and sell it to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
for unreasonable gains, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tale,
and as we call it, by piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal;
they are got into a way,


<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48337:122"/>
after a stingeing rate, to play their
game upon such by Extortion: I mean
such who buy up Butter, Cheese,
Eggs, Bacon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by whole sale, and
sell it again (as they call it) by
penny worths, two penny worths,
a half penny worth, or the like, to
the poor, all the week after the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
is past.</p>
               <p>These, though I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
them all, do, many of them,
<hi>bite</hi> and <hi>pinch</hi> the poor by this kind
of evil dealing.<note place="margin">Pro. 22. 16, 22.</note> These destroy the
poor because he is poor, and
that is a grievious sin. <hi>He that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
the poor to increase his riches,
and that giveth to the rich, shall sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
come to want.</hi> Therefore he
saith again, <hi>Rob not the poor because
he is poor, neither oppress the afflicted
in the gate; for the Lord will plead
their cause, and spoil the soul of them
that spoile them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh that he that gripeth and grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the face of the poor, would take
notice of these two Scriptures!
Here is threatned the destruction
of the Estate, yea and of the Soul
too, of them that oppress the poor.
Their Soul we shall better see where,


<pb n="215" facs="tcp:48337:122"/>
and in what condition that is in,
when the day of Doom is come;
but for the Estates of such, they
usually quickly moulter; and that
sometimes all men, and sometimes
no man knows how.</p>
               <p>Besides,<note place="margin">Deut. 23. 19.</note> these are Usurers, yea
they take usury for <hi>victuals, which
thing the Lord has forbidden.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they cannot so well do it on
the Market-day, therefore they do
it, as I said, when the market is
over; for then the poor falls into their
mouths, and are necessitated to have,
as they can, for their need, and they
are resolved they shall pay soundly
for it. Perhaps some will find fault
for my medling <hi>thus</hi> with other
folks matters, and for my thus pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the secrets of their iniquity.
But to such I would say, since such
actions are evil, 'tis time they were
hissed out of the world. For all that
doe such things, offend against God,
wrong their neighbour, and like Mr.
<hi>Badman</hi> doe provoke God to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

and all the rest of that Gang: but
that I never shall doe, for the Word

               <p>First, If it be lawful for me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

or for as much as I can, then 'tis law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for me to lay aside in my deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

that a man must lay it aside that will

                  <note place="margin">Gen. 23. 8, 9,</note> Gen. 23.
8, 9. He would not have it under
foot, he scorned it, he abhored it:
It stood not with his Religion, Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
nor Conscience. So also when
<hi>David,</hi> would buy a field of <hi>Ornon</hi>
the <hi>Jebusite:</hi> Thus he said unto him:
<hi>Grant me the place of the threshing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floor,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Crhon. 21, 22. 24.</note>
                  <hi>that I may build an Altar there
unto the Lord. Thou shalt give it me
for the full price.</hi> He also, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>


                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:48337:125"/>
made conscience of this kind
of dealing: he would not lie at catch
to go beyond, no not the <hi>Jebusite,</hi>
but will give him his full price for
his field. For he knew that there
was wickedness, as in selling too dear
so in buying too cheap, therefore he
would not do it.</p>
               <p>There ought therefore to be good
conscience used, as in selling, so in
buying; for 'tis also unlawful for a
man to goe beyond or to defraud
his neighbour in buying; yea 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
to doe it in <hi>any matter,</hi> and
God will plentifully avenge that
wrong: as I also before have fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned
and testified. See also the
<note n="*" place="margin">Levit. 25. 14.</note> text in the margent. But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, if it be lawful for me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to sell my commodity as dear,<note place="margin">Charity must be used in our deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note>
or for as much as I can, then it is
lawful for me to deal with my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
without the use of * charity:
but it is not lawful for me to <hi>lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,</hi>
or to deal with my neighbour
<hi>without</hi> the use of charity, therefore it
is not lawful for me always to sell my
commodity to my neighbour for as
much as I can. A man in dealing
should as really design his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours


<pb n="221" facs="tcp:48337:125"/>
good, profit, and advantage,
as his own: For this is to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
Charity in his dealing.</p>
               <p>That I should thus use, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
charity towards my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in my buying and selling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
with him, is evident from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
command: [<hi>Let all your things
be done in charity:</hi>]<note place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 14.</note> But that a man
cannot live in the exercise of chatity,
that selleth, as afore, as dear, or that
buyeth as cheap as he can, is evident
by these reasons.</p>
               <p>1. He that sells his commodity as
dear, or for as much money (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways)
as he can, seeks himself,
and himself only; (<hi>but charity seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
nor her own,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>nor her own only:</hi>)
So then, he that seeks himself, and
himself onely, as he that sells (as
afore) as dear as he can, does;
maketh not use of, nor doth he
exercise charity, in his so deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>2. He that selleth his commodity
(always) for as much as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> get,
hardeneth his heart against all reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
entreaties of the buyer. But
he that doth so, cannot exercise
charity in his dealing; therefore it is


<pb n="222" facs="tcp:48337:126"/>
not lawful for a man to sell his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity,
as afore, as dear as he can.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If it be lawful for me to
sell my commodity, as afore, as dear
as I can, then there can be no sin in
my Trading,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 25.</note> how unreasonably so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I manage my calling, whether
by Lying,<note place="margin">There may be and is sin in trading.</note> Swearing, Cursing, Cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
for all this is but to sell my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
as dear as I can: but that
there is sin in these, is evident,
therefore I may not sell my commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
always as dear as I can.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He that sells, as afore, as
dear as he can, offereth violence to
the law of Nature: for that saith,
<hi>Doe unto all men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 7. 12.</note>

               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">We must not abuse the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

as dear as he can, makes use of that
instruction, that God hath not given
to <hi>others,</hi> but sealed up in <hi>his</hi> hand,
to abuse his Law, and to wrong his
neighbour withall: which indeed is


<pb n="223" facs="tcp:48337:126"/>
contrary to God. God hath given
thee more skill, more knowledge
and understanding in thy commodity
than he hath given to him that would
buy of thee. But what! canst thou
think, that God has given thee this,
that thou mightest thereby make a
prey of thy neighbour? that thou
mightest thereby goe beyond and
beguile thy neighbour? No, verily;
but he hath given thee it, for <hi>his</hi>
help; that thou mightest in <hi>this,
be eyes to the blind,</hi> and save thy
neighbour from that dammage, that
his <hi>ignorance,</hi> or <hi>necessity,</hi> or <hi>fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
would betray him into the

               <p>Sixthly, In all that a man does,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of God, but that he cannot have that

               <p>Seventhly, All that a man does,
he should doe in the Name of the
Lord Jesus Christ; that is, as being
commanded,<note place="margin">Colo. 3. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

it by him: but he that selleth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
as dear as he can, cannot so
much as pretend to this, without


<pb n="224" facs="tcp:48337:127"/>
horrid blaspheming of that Name,
because commanded by him to doe
otherwise.</p>
               <p>Eightly, and lastly, In all that a
man does, he should have an eye to
the day of Judgment, and to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of how his actions will be
esteemed of in that day.<note place="margin">Acts. 24. 15, 16.</note> Therefore
there is not any man can or ought
to sell always as dear as he can: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he will, yea he must say, in so
doing, I will run the hazard of the
tryal of that day,</p>
               <p>If thou sell ought unto thy neighbour,<note place="margin">Levit. 25. 14.</note>
or buyest ought of thy neighbour,
ye shall not oppress one another.</p>

               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>But why doe you put in
those cautionary words? They must
not sell [always] as dear, nor buy
[always] as cheap as they can: doe
you not thereby intimate that a man
may sometimes do so?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>I doe indeed intimate that
somtimes the seller may sell as dear,
and the buyer buy as cheap as he
can; but this is allowable only in
these cases: When he that sells is a
Knave, and lays aside all good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
in selling; or when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>

is a Knave, and layes aside all good


<pb n="225" facs="tcp:48337:127"/>
conscience in buying. If the buyer
therefore lights of a Knave, or if the
seller lights of a Knave, then let them
look to themselves: but yet so, as
not to lay aside conscience, because
he that thou dealest with doth so:
but how vile or base soever the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is, do thou keep thy commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
at a reasonable price: or if thou
buyest, offer reaso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>able gain for the
thing thou wouldest have: and if
this will not do with the buyer or
seller, then seek thee a more honest
chapman: If thou objectest, But I
have not skil to know when a penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth
is before me: Get some that
have more skill than thy self in that
affair, and let them in that matter
dispose of thy money. But if there
were no Knaves in the world, these
objections need not be made.</p>
               <p>And thus, my very good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
have I given you a few of
my reasons, why a man that hath
it, should not always sell too dear,
nor buy as cheap as he can: but
should use good Conscience to God,
and Charity to his Neighbour in
both:</p>

to be frivolous by all that are of Mr.
<hi>Badmans</hi> way; 'tis also difficult in
it self: yet I will endeavour to shape
you an Answer, and that first to the
matter of the question; to wit, <hi>How
a Tradesman should, in Trading,
keep a good conscience;</hi> (A buyer or
seller either.) Secondly, <hi>How he should
prepare himself to this work, and live
in the practice of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the first:<note n="*" place="margin">Preparati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons to be a good dealer.</note> He must observe
what hath been said before, to wit,
he must have conscience to God,
charity to his neighbour; and I will
add, much moderation in dealing.
Let him therefore keep within the
bounds of the affirmative of those
eight reasons that before were urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to prove, that men ought not in
their Dealing, but to do Justly and
mercifully 'twixt man and, man; and
then there will be no great fear of
wronging the seller, buyer, or himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:48337:129"/>
But particularly to prepare, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
a man to this work:</p>
               <p>1. Let the Tradesman or others
consider, that there is not that in
great Gettings, and in abundance,
which the most of men do suppose:
For all that a man has over and
above what serves for his present
necessity and supply, serves only to
seed the lusts of the eye.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>For what

                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 7, 8, 9.</note> Men also, many times, in
getting of riches, get therewith a
snare to their soul: But few get
good by getting of them. But this
consideration, Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> could
not abide.</p>
               <p>2. Consider, that the getting of
wealth dishonestly (as he does, that
getteth it without good conscience
and charity to his neighbour,) is a
great offender against God. Hence
he says,<note place="margin">Ezek. 2. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>I have smitten mine hands

that thou knowest not the day
of thy death. Remember also, that
when death comes, God will give
<hi>thy</hi> substance, for the which <hi>thou</hi>
hast laboured, and for the which
perhaps thou hast hazarded thy
soul, to <hi>one,</hi> thou knowest not who,
nor whether he shall be a wise man
or a fool. And then,<note place="margin">Eccles. 5. 13, 14, 15.</note> 
                  <hi>what profit hath
he that laboureth for the wind?</hi>

               <p>Besides, thou shalt have nothing

These things duly considered, and

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:48337:130"/>
do things grow dear? use no cunning
or deceitful language to pull them
down: for that cannot be done but
wickedly too. What then shall we
do? will you say. Why I answer:
Leave things to the providence of
God, and do thou with moderation
submit to his hand. But since, when
they are growing dear, the hand
that upholds the price, is, for the
time, more strong than that which
would pull it down; That being the
hand of the seller, who loveth to have
it dear, specially if it shall rise in his
hand: therefore I say, do thou take
heed, and have not a hand in it.
The which thou mayest have to thine
own and thy neighbours hurt, these
three ways:</p>
               <p>1. By crying out <hi>scaroity, scarcity,</hi>
beyond the truth and state of things:
especially take heed of doing of
this by way of a prognostick for time
to come. I was for<note n="*" place="margin">A Judgment of God. 2 King. 7.</note> this for which he
was trodden to death in the gate of
<hi>Samaria,</hi> that you read of in the book
of <hi>Kings.</hi> This sin has a double evil
in it. 1. It belieth the present
blessing of God amongst us: and,
2. It undervalueth the riches of his


<pb n="232" facs="tcp:48337:131"/>
goodness, which can make all good
things to abound towards us.</p>
               <p>2. This wicked thing may be
done by hoa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ding up, when the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and Necessity of the poor calls
for it. Now that God may shew
his dislike against this, he doth, as
it were, license the people to curse

                  <hi>He that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth

but blessing shall be upon the head of
him that selleth it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. But if things will rise, do thou
be grieved; Be also moderate in all
thy sellings, and be sure let the poor
have a pennyworth, and sell thy
Corn to those in necessity: Which
then thou wilt do, when thou shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
mercy to the poor in thy selling
to him, and when thou for his sake,
because he is poor, undersellest the
market. This is to buy and sell
with good conscience; thy buyer
thou wrongest not, thy Conscience
thou wrongest not,<note place="margin">Isa. 58. 6, 7, 8.</note> thy self thou
wrongest not, for God will surely
recompense thee.</p>

proceed: This Mr. <hi>Badman,</hi> added
to all his wickedness this, <hi>He was

He was exceeding proud and haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in mind; He looked, that what
he said, ought not, must not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted
or opposed. He counted
himself as wise as the wisest in
the Countrey, as good as the best,
and as beautiful as he that had most
of it. He took great delight in
praising of himself, and as much
in the praises that others gave him.
He could not abide that any should
think themselves above him, or that
their wit or personage should by


<pb n="234" facs="tcp:48337:132"/>
others be set before his.<note place="margin">Of pride in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

scarce a fellowly carriage for his
equals. But for those that were of
an inferior ranck, he would look
over them in great contempt. And
if at any time he had any remote oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of having to do with them,
he would shew great height, and a
very domineering spirit. So that in
this it may be said that <hi>Solomon</hi> gave
a characteristical note of him, when
he said:<note place="margin">Pro. 21. 24.</note>

               <p>This Pride, is a sin that
sticks as close to nature I think, as
most sins. There is Vncleanness and
Pride, I know not of any two gross sins
that stick closer to men then they.
They have, as I may call it, an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in Nature; it likes them because
they most suit its lusts and fancies:
and therefore no marvel though Mr.
<hi>Badman</hi> was tainted with pride, since
he had so wickedly given up himself
to work all iniquity with greediness.</p>

               <p>You say right; <hi>Pride,</hi> is

even in Childhood, even in little
children, <hi>Pride</hi> will first of all shew
it self; it is a hasty, an early appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the sin of the soul. It, as I may
say, is that corruption that strives
for predominancy in the heart, and
therefore usually comes out first.
But though children are so incident
to it, yet methinks those of more
years, should be ashamed thereof.
I might at the first have begun with
Mr. <hi>Badmans Pride,</hi> only I think it
is not the <hi>Pride</hi> in Infancy, that
begins to make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
one and another, as did, and
do those wherewith I began my
relation of his life: therefore I passed
it over, but now, since he had no
more consideration of himself, and
of his vile and sinful state, but to be
proud when come to years; I have
taken the occasion in this place to
make mention of his pride.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>

I the rather desire this, because that


<pb n="236" facs="tcp:48337:133"/>
pride is now a reigning sin, and I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
sometimes to fall into the company
of them that in my conscience are proud,
very much, and I have a mind also to
tell them of their sin; now when I tell
them of it, unless I bring Gods word too,
I doubt they will laugh me to scorn.</p>

when you have said what you can,
they will tell you they are not proud,

               <p>But I have been told, that
when some have been rebuked for their
pride, they have turned it again
upon the brotherhood of those by whom
they have been rebuked: saying,
Physician heal thy Friends, look at
home, among your Brotherhood, even
among the wisest of you, and see if you
your selves be clear, even you profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors:
for who is prouder than you
professors? searcesly the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>

because there is too much
cause for it. This very Answer
would Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> give his wife,
when she (as she would some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times)
reproved him for his pride:


<pb n="243" facs="tcp:48337:136"/>
We shall have, says he, great amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in living now, <hi>for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil

no sin reigneth more in the world,
quoth he, than pride among pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors.
And who can contradict
him? <hi>let us give the Devil his due,</hi>
the thing is too apparent for any man
to deny.</p>
               <p>And I doubt not but the same
answer is ready in the mouths of
Mr. <hi>Badmans</hi> friends; for they may
and do see <hi>pride</hi> display it self in the
Apparel and carriages of professors;
one may say, almost as much, as
among any people in the Land, the
more is the pity. Ay, and I fear that
even their Extravagancies in this,
hath hardened the heart of many a
one, as I perceive it did somewhat
the heart of Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> himself.</p>
               <p>For mine own part, I have seen
many my self, and those Church-members
too, so deckt and bedaub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with their Fangles and Toyes,
and that when they have been at the
solemn Appointments of God, in the
way of his Worship, that I have
wondred with what face such paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
persons could sit in the place


<pb n="244" facs="tcp:48337:137"/>
where they were without swound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
But certainly the holiness of
God, and also the pollution of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by sin, must needs be very
far out of the minds of such peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
what profession soever they
make.</p>

               <p>Sir, you seem to be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>I know not what they have

                     </gap>ors a shame and stumbling-block to the world.</note>
And I will add, it is a shame, it is a
reproach, it is a stumbling-block to
the blind; for though men be as
blind as Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> himself, yet
they can see the foolish lightness
that must needs be the bottom of
all these apish and wanton extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies.
But many have their
excuses ready; to wit, their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi>
their <hi>Husbands,</hi> and their
<hi>breeding</hi> calls for it, and the like:
yea, the examples of good people
prompt them to it: but all these
will be but the Spiders webb, when
the thunder of the Word of the

against them, as it will at Death or

it before. But alas! these <hi>excuses</hi>
are but <hi>bare</hi> pretences, these proud


<pb n="246" facs="tcp:48337:138"/>
ones <hi>love to have it so.</hi> I once
talked with a Maid, by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,

               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>Now you are speaking of the
cause of pride,<note place="margin">Why pride is in such request.</note> pray shew me yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
why pride is now so much in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>I will shew you what I
think are the reasons of it.<note place="margin">1 Reason.</note>
               </p>
               <p>1. The first is, Because such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<hi>are led by their own hearts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 7. 22, 23.</note> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than by the Word of God.
I told you before, that the original
fountain of <hi>pride</hi> is the heart. For
out of the heart comes pride; it is
therefore because they are led by
their hearts,<note place="margin">Obad. 3.</note> which naturally tends
to lift them up in <hi>pride.</hi> This <hi>pride</hi> of
heart, tempts them, and by its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
overcometh them; yea it doth
put a bewitching vertue into their


<pb n="247" facs="tcp:48337:138"/>
Peacocks feathers, and then they
are swallowed up with the vanity of
them.</p>
               <p>2. Another reason why professors
are <hi>so proud,</hi> (for those we are talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of now) is because they are more
apt to take example by those that
are of the World, than they are to
take example of those that are Saints
indeed. <hi>Pride</hi> is of the world. <hi>For
all that is of the world,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>the lusts of the
slesh, the lust of the eyes, and the
pride of life, are not of the Father
but of the world.</hi> Of the world there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Professors learn to be proud.
But they should not take them for
example. It will be objected, No,
nor your saints neither, for you are as
proud as others: Well, let them take
shame that are guilty. But when I
say, professors should take example
for their life by those that are saints
indeed, I mean as <hi>Peter</hi> says: They
should take example of those that
were in <hi>old time,</hi> the saints; for
saints of old time were the best,
therefore to these he directeth us
for our patrern.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 1, 3, 4, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Let the wives con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
be chast, and also coupled
with fear. Whose adorning,</hi> saith Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,


<pb n="248" facs="tcp:48337:139"/>
                  <hi>let it not be that outward adorning,
of pleating the hair, and of wearing of
gold, or of putting on of Apparel:
but let it be the hidden man of the
heart, in that which is not corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
even the ornament of a meek and
quiet spirit, which is in the sight of
God of great price. For after this
manner, in the old time, the holy
women also who trusted in God, adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves, being in subjection to
their own husband.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3 Reason.</note>
               </p>
               <p>3. Another reason is, Because
they have forgotten the pollution of
their Nature. For the remembrance
of that, must needs keep us humble,
and being kept humble, we shall
be at a distance from pride. The
proud and the humble are set in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position;
(God resisteth the proud,
but giveth grace to the humble.)
And can it be imagined, that a sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Christian should be a proud one;
sence of baseness tends to lay us low,
not to list us up with pride; not
with pride of Heart, nor pride of
Life: But when a man begins to
forget what he is, then he, if ever,
begins to be proud.</p>
               <p>Methinks it is one of the most


<pb n="249" facs="tcp:48337:139"/>
senceless and ridiculous things in
the world, that a man should be
proud of that which is given him on
purpose to cover the shame of his
nakedness with.</p>
               <p>4. Persons that are proud,<note place="margin">4 Reason.</note> have
gotten God and his Holiness out of
their sight. If God was before them,
as he is behind their back; And if
they saw him in his holiness, as he
sees them in their sins and shame,
they would take but little pleasure
in their apisn Knacks. The Holiness
of God makes the Angels cover
their faces,<note place="margin">Isa. 6.</note> crumbles Christians,
when they behold it, into dust and
ashes: and as his Majesty is, such is
his Word; Therefore they abuse
it, that bring it to countenance
pride.</p>
               <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">5 Reason.</note> But what can be the end
of those that are proud, in the deck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of themselves after their antick
manner? why are they for going
with their Bulls-foretops, with their
naked shoulders, and Paps hanging
out like a Cows bag? why are they
for painting their faces, for stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out their necks, and for putting
of themselves into all the Formalities


<pb n="250" facs="tcp:48337:140"/>
which proud Fancy leads them to?
Is it because they would honour
God? because they would adorn
the Gospel? because they would
beautifie Religion, and make sinners
to fall in love with their own salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
No, no. It is rather to please
their lusts, to satisfie their wild and
extravagant fancies; and I wish
none doth it to stir up lust in others,
to the end they may commit unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with them. I believe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is their end, this is one of the
great designes of the Devil: and I
believe also, that Satan has drawn
more into the sin of uncleanness, by
the spangling shew of fine cloaths,
than he could possibly have drawn
unto it, without them. I wonder
what it was, that of old was called
the Attire of an Harlot: certainly it
could not be more bewitching and
tempting than are the garments
of many professors this day.</p>

The Angels when they became De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 6.</note>

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:48337:142"/>
upon the unthankful and unholy,)
he would ascribe the glory to other
causes. If they were Mercies, he
would ascribe them (if the open
face of the providence did not give
him the lye) to his own wit, labour,
care, industry, cunning, or the
like: if they were Crosses, he would
ascribe them, or count them the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring
of Fortune, ill Luck, Chance,
the ill mannagement of matters, the
ill will of neighbours, or to his wifes
being Religious, and spending, as he
called it, too much time in Reading,

sayes,<note place="margin">Psal. 29. 5.</note> he would not see the works
of God, nor regard the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his hands either in mercies or
in Judgments. But further, when


<pb n="255" facs="tcp:48337:142"/>
by Providence he has been cast un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the best Means for his soul, (for,
as was shewed before, he having

Saying, How do you know them to

another: As he came home drunk
from such an Ale-house, said a
third; A Judgment of God upon
him, said a fourth. This his sin, his
shame, and punishment, are all made
conspicuous to all that are about
him. I will here tell you another
story or two.</p>
               <p>I have read in Mr. <hi>Clark'</hi>s <hi>Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glass</hi>
                  <note place="margin">pag. 41.</note>
                  <hi>for Sinners;</hi> That upon a
time, a certain drunken fellow boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his Cups, that there was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Heaven nor Hell; also he said,
He believed, that man had no Soul,
and that for his own part, <hi>he would
sell his soul to any that would buy it.</hi>
Then did one of his companions buy
it of him for a cup of Wine; and
presently the Devil in mans shape
bought it of that man again at the
the same price; and so in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of them all laid hold on this
Soul-seller, and carried him away
through the Air, so that he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
more heard of.</p>
               <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 148. he tells us also: That
there was one at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> in the
midst of his health drinking and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousing
in a Tavern; and he drank
a health to the Devil, saying, That


<pb n="269" facs="tcp:48337:149"/>
if the Devil would not come and
pledge him, he would not believe
that there was either God or Devil.
Whereupon his companions stricken
with fear, hastened out of the room:
and presently after, hearing a hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
noise, and smelling a stinking
savour, the Vintner ran up into
the chamber; and coming in, he
missed his Guest, and found the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
broken, the Iron barr in it
bowed, and all bloody: But the
man was never heard of after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>Again, in <hi>pag.</hi> 149. he tells us
of a Bailiff of <hi>Hedly:</hi> Who upon a
Lords Day being drunk at <hi>Melford,</hi>
got upon his horse, to ride through
the streets, saying, <hi>That his horse
would carry him to the Devil:</hi> and
presently his hor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

broke his neck. These things are
worse than the breaking of Mr.
<hi>Badmans</hi> Leg, and should be a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to all of his friends that are
living, lest they also fall by their
sin into these sad Judgements of
God.</p>
               <p>But, as I said, Mr. <hi>Badman</hi>
quickly forgot all, his conscience


<pb n="270" facs="tcp:48337:150"/>
was choaked, before his legg was
healed. And therefore, before he
was well of the fruit of one sin, he
tempts God to send another Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to seize upon him: And so he
did quickly after. For not many
months after his legg was well, he
had a very dangerous fit of sickness,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> fallen sick.</note>
insomuch that now he began to
think he must dye in very deed.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>He thought he must go

not forbear but say so. To my

out all one night for fear, and at
times he would so tremble, that he
would make the very bed shake
under him.<note n="*" place="margin">He cryes out in his sickness.</note> But, Oh! how the
thoughts of Death, of Hell-fire, and
of eternal Judgment, did then wrack
his conscience. Fear might be seen
in his face, and in his tossings to
and fro: It might also be heard in
his words, and be understood by
his heavy groans. He would often
cry, I am undone, I am undone; my
vile life has undone me.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>Then his former atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal


<pb n="271" facs="tcp:48337:150"/>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>Aie! they were too weak
indeed. They may serve to stifle
conscience, when a man is in the
midst of his prosperity, and to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
the heart against all good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
when a man is left of God, and
given up to his reprobate mind:
<note n="*" place="margin">His A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism will not help him now.</note> But alas, atheistical thoughts, Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Opinions, must shrink and
melt away, when God sends, yea
comes with sickness to visit the soul
of such a sinner for his sin. There
was a man dwelt abour 12 miles off
from us, that had so trained up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in his atheistical Notions, that at
last he attempted to write a book
against Jesus Christ, and against the
divine Authority of the Scriptures.
(But I think it was not printed:)
Well, after many days God struck
him with sickness, whereof he dyed.
So, being sick, and musing upon
his former doings, the Book that
he had written came into his mind,
and with it such a sence of his evil
in writing of it, that it tore his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
as a Lyon would tare a Kid.


<pb n="272" facs="tcp:48337:151"/>
He lay therefore upon his death-bed
in sad case,<note place="margin">A dreadful example of Gods anger.</note> and much affliction of
conscience: some of my friends also
went to see him; and as they were
in his chamber one day, he hastily
called for Pen Ink and Paper, which
when it was given him, he took it
and writ to this purpose. <hi>I, such
an one, in such a Town, must goe to

Jesus Christ, and against the Holy
Scriptures:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> And would also have
leaped out of the window of his
house to have killed himself, but
was by them prevented of that:
so he dyed in his bed, such a death

               <p>Well, you have told me
what were Mr. <hi>Badmans</hi> thoughts


<pb n="273" facs="tcp:48337:151"/>
(now, being sick) of his condition;
pray tell me also what he then did
when he was sick?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>Did! he did many things,
which I am sure he never thought
to have done, and which, to be
sure, was not looked for of his wife
and children.</p>
               <p>In this fit of sickness,<note place="margin">What Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> did more when he was sick.</note> his Thoughts
were quite altered about his wife;
I say his Thoughts, so far as could be
judged by his words and carriages to
her. For now she was his <hi>good</hi>
wife, his <hi>godly</hi> wife, his <hi>honest</hi>
wife, his <hi>duck,</hi> and <hi>dear,</hi> and all.
Now he told her, that she had the
best of it, she having a good Life to
stand by her, while his debaucheries
and ungodly Life did always stare
him in the face. Now he told her,
the counsel that she often gave him,
was <hi>good;</hi> though he was so <hi>bad</hi> as
not to take it.</p>
               <p>Now he would hear her talk to
him,<note place="margin">Great alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration made in Mr. <hi>Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
                  </note> and he would lie sighing by
her while she so did. Now he would
bid her pray for him, that he might
be delivered from Hell.</p>
               <p>He would also now consent, that
some of her good Ministers might


<pb n="274" facs="tcp:48337:152"/>
come to him to comfort him; and
he would seem to shew them kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
when they came, for he would
treat them kindly with words, and
hearken diligently to what they
said, only he did not care that they
should talk much of his ill spent life,
because his conscience was clogged
with that already; he cared not now
to see his old companions, the
thoughts of them was a torment to
him: and now he would speak kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to that child of his that took after
its mothers steps, though he could
not at all abide it before.</p>
               <p>He also desired the prayers of
good people, that God of his mercy
would spare him a little longer,
promising that if God would but
let him recover this once, what a
new, what a penitent man he would
be toward God, and what a loving
husband he would be to his wife:
what liberty he would give her, yea
how he would goe with her him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to hear her Ministers, and how
they should go hand in hand in the
way to heaven together.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>Here was a fine shew of
things; I'le warrant you, his wife was
glad for this.</p>

            <sp>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:48337:152"/>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>His wife! Aie,<note place="margin">The Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talk of Mr. <hi>Badmans</hi> change.</note> and a many
good people besides: it was noysed all
over the Town, what a great change
there was wrought upon Mr. <hi>Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi>
how sorry he was for his sins,
how he began to love his wife, how
he desired good men should pray to
God to spare him; and what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
he now made to God in his
sickness, that if ever he should raise
him from his sick bed to health
again, what a new penitent man
he would be towards God, and
what a loving husband to his good
wife.</p>
               <p>Well, ministers prayed, and good
people rejoyced, thinking verily
that they now had gotten a man
from the Devil; nay, some of the
weaker sort did not stick to say that
God had began a work of Grace in
his heart;<note place="margin">His wife is comforted.</note> and his wife, poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
you cannot think how apt she
was to believe it so; she rejoyced,
and she hoped as she would have
it. But, alas! alas! in little time
things all proved otherwise.</p>
               <p>After he had kept his Bed a
while,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> recovers and returns to his old course.</note> his distemper began to abate,
and he to feel himself better, so


<pb n="276" facs="tcp:48337:153"/>
he in little time was so finely mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that he could walk about the
house, and also obtained a very fine
stomach to his food: and now did
his wife and her good friends stand
gaping, to see Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> fulfill
his promise of becoming new to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, and loving to his wife:
but the contrary only shewed it
self. For so soon as ever he had hopes
of mending, and found that his
strength began to renew, his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
began to goe off his heart, and
he grew as great a stranger to his
frights and fears, as if he had never
had them.</p>
               <p>But verily, I am apt to think,
that one reason of his no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding,
or remembring of his
sick-bed fears, and of being no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for them, was, some words that
the Doctor that supplied him with
Physick said to him when he was
mending. For as soon as Mr. <hi>Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
began to mend, the Doctor
comes and sits him down by him in
his house, and there fell into dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
with him about the nature of
his disease; and among other things
they talked of <hi>Badmans</hi> trouble,


<pb n="277" facs="tcp:48337:153"/>
and how he would cry out, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and express his fears of going
to Hell when his sickness lay pretty
hard upon him. To which the
Doctor replyed:<note place="margin">Ignorant physicians kill souls while they cure bodyes.</note> 
                  <hi>That those fears
and Out-cries did arise from the
height of his distemper, for that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
was often attended with lightness
of the head, by reason the sick party
could not sleep, and for that the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
disturbed the brain: But you
see Sir, quoth he, that so soon as you
got sleep and betook your self to rest,
you quickly mended, and your head
settled, and so those frenzies left
you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And was it so indeed, thought
Mr. <hi>Badman;</hi> was my troubles, only
the effects of my distemper, and
because ill vapours got up into my
brain? Then surely, since my Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
was my Saviour, my Lust again
shall be my God. So he never
minded Religion more, but betook
him again to the world, his lusts and
wicked companions: And there was
an end of Mr. <hi>Badmans</hi> Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>I thought, (as you told me
of him) that this would be the result of


<pb n="278" facs="tcp:48337:154"/>
the whole; for I discerned by your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
of things, that the true sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms
of conversion were wanting in
him, and that those that appeared to
be any thing like them, were only such

               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>You say right, for there
wanted in him, when he was most

were, to be delivered from going
to Hell, (and who would willingly?)
and that his life might be lengthened
in this world. We find not by all that
he said or did, that Jesus Christ the
Saviour was desired by him, from a
sence of his need of his Righteousness
to cloath him, and of his Spirit to
sanctifie him.</p>
               <p>His own strength was whole in
him, he saw nothing of the treachery
of his own heart; for had he, he would
never have been so free to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
to God of amendment. He
would rather have been afraid, that


<pb n="279" facs="tcp:48337:154"/>
if he had mended, he should have
turned with the dog to his vomit, and
have begged prayers of Saints, and
assistance from heaven upon <hi>that</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that he might have been kept

'twas rather from conviction that

again to health till they mend;

the thoughts of the Grave, but

               <p>He did what he could to
divert her talk,<note place="margin">He diverts her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</note> by throwing in
other things; he also shewed some
kind of pity to her now, and would
ask her, What she would have? and
with various kind of words put her
out of her talk; for when she see
that she was not regarded, she fetcht
a deep sigh, and lay still. So he
went down, and then she called
for her Children, and began to talk
to them.<note place="margin">Her speech to her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that were rude.</note> And first she spake to
those that were rude, and told them
the danger of dying before they
had grace in their hearts. She told
them also, that Death might be
nearer them than they were aware
of; and bid them look, when they
went through the Church-yard
again, if there was not little graves
there. And, ah children, said she,
will it not be dreadful to you, if
we only shall meet at the day of
Judgment, and then part again,
and never see each other more?
And with that she wept, the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
(also) wept; so she held on
her discourse: Children, said she,


<pb n="288" facs="tcp:48337:159"/>
I am going from you,<note place="margin">Rev. 7. 16.</note> I am going
to Jesus Christ, and with him there
is neither sorrow,<note place="margin">Chap. 21. 3, 4.</note> nor sighing, nor
pain, nor tears, nor death. Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would I have you go also, but
I can neither carry you, nor fetch
you thither; but if you shall turn
from your sins to God, and shall
beg mercy at his hands by Jesus
Christ, you shall follow me, and
shall, when you dye, come to the
place where I am going, that
blessed place of Rest: and then we
shall be for ever together, beholding
the face of our Redeemer, to our
mutual and eternal joy. So she
bid them remember the words of a
dying mother when she was <hi>cold</hi> in
her <hi>grave,</hi> and themselves were <hi>hot</hi>
in their <hi>sins,</hi> if perhaps her words
might put check to their vice, and
that they might remember and turn
to God.</p>
               <p>Then they all went down; but

                  <hi>if thou shalt hold
the beginning of thy confidence stedfast

thou still remember my words, love
thy Bible, follow my Ministers,
deny ungodliness still, and if trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blous
times shall come, set an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
price upon Christ, his Word and
Wayes, and the testimony of a
good conscience, than upon all the
world besides. Carry it kindly and
dutifully to thy Father, but choose
none of his ways. If thou mayest,
goe to service, choose that, rather
than to stay at home; but then be
sure to choose a service where thou
mayest be helped forwards in the
way to heaven; and that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
have such a service, speak to
my Minister, he will help thee, if
possible, to such an one.</p>
               <p>I would have thee also, my dear
child, to love thy Brothers and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
but learn none of their naughty
tricks.<note place="margin">Ephes. 5. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Have no fellowship with the

Grace, they have none: do thou
therefore beautifie the way of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
before their eyes, by a
godly life and conformable conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
to the revealed will of God,
that thy Brothers and Sisters may
see and be the more pleased with the
good wayes of the Lord.</p>
               <p>If thou shalt live to marry, take
heed of being served as I was; that
is, of being beguiled with fair
words, and the flatteries of a lying
tongue. But first be sure of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Yea, as sure as it is possible
for one to be in this world: trust
not thine own eyes, nor thine own
Judgment; I mean as to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
godliness that thou art invited
to marry. Ask counsel of good
men, and do nothing therein, if he
lives, without my Ministers advice. I
have also my self desired him to
look after thee. Thus she talked
to her children, and gave them
counsel, and after she had talked to
this a little longer, she kiss'd it, and
bid it go down.</p>
               <p>Well, in short, her time drew
on, and the day that she must die.
So she<note n="*" place="margin">Her death</note> died with a soul full of


<pb n="291" facs="tcp:48337:160"/>
Grace, an heart full of comfort,
and by her death ended a life full
of trouble. Her husband made a
Funerall for her, perhaps because
he was glad he was rid of her, but
we will leave that to be manifest at
Judgment.</p>

the sickness whereof he died. And
as he lay drawing on, the woman that

ever she heard in her life, which also
continued untill he gave up the Ghost:
now when his soul departed from him,<note place="margin">☜</note>

in person, and carried her up into the
Air, with most horrible outcries and
roarings: And in that sort carried


<pb n="296" facs="tcp:48337:163"/>
her round about the Town, that the
Inhabitants were ready to dye for
fear: And by and by he tore her in
four pieces, leaving her four quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in four several high-wayes; and
then brought her Bowels to the
Marriage-feast, and threw them
upon the Table before the Maior of
the Town, saying, <hi>Behold, these
dishes of meat belong to thee, whom
the like destruction waiteth for, if
thou dost not amend thy wicked
life.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>Though God forbears to
deal thus with all men that thus rend
and tare his Name, and that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Judgments do not overtake them;
yet he makes their lives by other
Judgments bitter to them, does he
not?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, yes. And for proof,
I need goe no further than to this
<hi>Badman</hi> and his wife; for their rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and cursing, and swearing ended
not in words: They would fight
and fly at each other, and that like
Cats and Dogs. But it must be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon as the hand and Judgment
of God upon him for his villany;
he had an honest woman before, but


<pb n="297" facs="tcp:48337:163"/>
she would not serve his turn, and
therefore God took her away, and
gave him one as bad as himself.
Thus <hi>that</hi> measure that he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to his first wife, this last did
mete to him again. And this is a
punishment, wherewith sometimes
God will punish wicked men. So
said <hi>Amos</hi> to <hi>Amaziah: Thy wife
shall be an Harlot in the City.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Amo. 7. 16, 17.</note> With
this last wife Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> lived a
pretty while; but, as I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in a most sad and hellish manner.
And now he would bewail his first
wifes death: not of love that he
had to her Godliness, for that he
could never abide, but for that she
used alwayes to keep home, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
this would goe abroad; his first
wife was also honest, and true to
that Relation, but this last was a
Whore of her Body: The first wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
loved to keep things together,
but this last would whirl them about
as well as he: The first would be
silent when he chid, and would take
it patiently when he abused her,
but this would give him word for
word, blow for blow, curse for
curse; so that now Mr. <hi>Badman</hi>


                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:48337:164"/>
had met with his match:<note n="*" place="margin">He is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished in his last wife for his bad car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his first.</note> God had
a mind to make him see the baseness

his wives.<note n="†" place="margin">He is not at all the better.</note> But all would not do
with Mr. <hi>Badman,</hi> he would be Mr.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>What he thought I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell, but he could not hope for
it in this match. For here he knew
himself to be catcht, he knew that
he was by this woman intangled,
and would therefore have gone back
again, but could not. He knew her,
I say, to be a Whore before, and
therefore could not promise himself
a happy life with her. For <hi>he</hi> or <hi>she</hi>
that will not be true to their own
soul, will neither be true to husband
nor wife. And he knew that she was
not true to her own soul, and therefore
could not expect she should be true
to him: but <hi>Solomon</hi> says, <hi>An whore
is a deep pit,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> found
it true. For when she had caught


<pb n="299" facs="tcp:48337:164"/>
him in her pit, she would never
leave him till she had got him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
her Marriage; and when she had
taken him so for, she forced him to
marry indeed: And after that, they
lived that life that I have told you.</p>

that which made him stink when he

stink in his Name and Fame, was,
that he died with a spice of the

not that I altogether doubt it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause


<pb n="303" facs="tcp:48337:166"/>
you have affirmed it, but yet
I love to have proof for what men say

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>When I said, he died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
repentance, I meant, so far as
those that knew him, could judge,
when they compared his Life, the
Word, and his Death together.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>Well said, they went the

that is, did manifest that he had
repentance or no. Now then shew

none?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>So I will: And first, this
was urged to prove it.<note place="margin">1 Proof that he died im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent.</note> He had not
in all the time of his sickness, a sight
and sence of his sins, but was as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
and as much at quiet, as
if he had never sinned in all his
life.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>I must needs confess that
this is a sign he had none. For how
can a man repent of that of which
he hath neither sight nor sence? But
'tis strange that he had neither sight
nor sence of sin now, when he had
such a sight and sence of his evil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
I mean when he was sick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:48337:167"/>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>He was, as I said, as secure
now, as if he had been as sinless as an
Angel; though all men knew what
a sinner he was, for he carried his
Sins in his Forehead. His debauched
Life was read and known of <hi>all men;</hi>
but his Reputation was read and
known of <hi>no man;</hi> for, as I said,
he had none. And for ought I know,
the reason why he had no sence of
his sins now, was because he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
not by that sence that he had
of them before. He liked not to
retain that knowledge of God <hi>then,</hi>
that caused his sins to come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance:
Therefore God gave
him up <hi>now</hi> to a reprobate mind,
to hardness and stupidity of Spirit;
and so was that Scripture fulfilled
upon him,<note place="margin">Isa. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>He hath blinded their
eyes.</hi> And that, <hi>Let their eyes be
darkned that they may not see.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ro. 11.</note> Oh!
for a man to live in sin, and to goe
out of the world without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for it, is the saddest Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that can overtake a man.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>But, Sir, although both
you and I have consented that<note n="*" place="margin">No sence of sin, no repentance, proved.</note> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a sight and sence of sin there can
be do Repentance, yet that is but


<pb n="305" facs="tcp:48337:167"/>
our bare Say-so; let us therefore now
see if by the Scripture we can make
it good.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>That is easily done. The
three thousand that were converted,
(<hi>Acts</hi> the second,) repented not,<note place="margin">Acts 2.</note> till
they had sight and sence of their sins:
<hi>Paul</hi> repented not till he had sight
and sence of his sins:<note place="margin">Chap. 9.</note> the Jailor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
not till he had sight <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

what should a man repent? The
Answer is, of Sin. What is it to
Repent of sin? The answer is,<note place="margin">Psal. 38. 18.</note> To
be sorry for it, to turn from it. But
how can a man be sorry for it, that
has neither sight nor sence of it. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
did, not only commit sins, but
abode impenitent for them, untill
<hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet was sent from
God to give him a sight and sence
of them;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.</note> and then, but not till then,
he indeed repented of them. <hi>Job,</hi>
in order to his Repentance, cries
unto God, <hi>Shew me wherefore thou

                  <note place="margin">Job 10. 2.</note> And again, <hi>That

yet in what I know not, when thou
shalt shew me it.</p>
               <p>Also <hi>Ephraims</hi> Repentance was
after he was turned to the sight

<hi>before,</hi> but <hi>it</hi> dyed without procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
any such godly fruit; as was
manifest by his so soon returning
with the Dog to his Vomit. Many
people think also that Repentance
stands in Confession of sin only, but
they are very much mistaken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For
Repentance, as was said before, is
a being sorry for, and a turning
from transgression to God by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ. Now, if this be true,
that every sight and sence of sin will
not produce Repentance, then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
cannot be produced there
where there is <hi>no</hi> sight and sence of
sin. That every sight and sence of
sin will not produce repentance, to
wit, the godly repentance that we
are speaking of, is manifest in <hi>Cain,
Pharaoh, Saul</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> who all of


<pb n="308" facs="tcp:48337:169"/>
them had sence, great sence of sin, but
none of them repentance unto life.</p>
               <p>Now I conclude, that Mr. <hi>Badman</hi>
did die impenitent, and so a death
most miserable.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>But pray now, before we
conclude our discourse of Mr. <hi>Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
give me another proof of his
dying in his sins.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>Another proof is this. <hi>He
did not desire a sight and sence of sins,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 proof that he died im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent.</note>
                  <hi>that he might have repentance for
them.</hi> Did I say he did not desire
it, I will add, he greatly desired
to remain in his security: and that
I shall prove by that which follows.
First, He could not endure that any
man, <hi>now,</hi> should talk to him of
his sinfull life, and yet that was the
way to beget a sight and sence of
sin, and so of repentance from it,
in his soul. But, I say, he could
not endure such discourse. Those
men that did offer to talk unto him
of his ill-spent Life, they were
as little welcome to him in the time
of his last sickness,<note place="margin">1 King. 21. 17. 18, 19, 20, 21.</note> as was <hi>Elijah</hi>
when he went to meet with <hi>Ahab,</hi>
as he went down to take possession
of <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard. <hi>Hast thou


<pb n="309" facs="tcp:48337:169"/>
found me,</hi> said <hi>Ahab, O mine enemy?</hi>
So would Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> say in his
heart <hi>to</hi> and <hi>of</hi> those that thus did
come to him, though indeed they
came even of love, to convince him
of his evil life, that he might have
repented thereof, and have obtained
mercy.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>Did good men then goe to
see him in his last sickness?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>Yes: Those that were his
first wifes acquaintance, they went
to see him, and to talk with, and
to him, if perhaps he might now, at
last, bethink himself, and cry to
God for mercy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>They did well to try now
at last if they could save his soul
from Hell: But pray how can you tell
that he did not care for the company of
such?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>Because of the differing
Carriage that he had for <hi>them,</hi>
from what he had when his old car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
companions came to see him:
When his old Campanions came
to see him, he would stir up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
as much as he could both by
words and looks, to signifie they
were welcome to him; he would


<pb n="310" facs="tcp:48337:170"/>
also talk with them freely, and
look pleasantly upon them, though
the talk of such could be none other
but such as <hi>David</hi> said, carnal men
would offer to <hi>him,</hi> when they
came to visit <hi>him</hi> in <hi>his</hi> sickness:
<hi>If he comes to see me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 41. 6.</note> says he, <hi>he
speaketh vanity, his heart gathereth
iniquity to it self.</hi> But these kind
of talks, I say, Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> better
brooked, than he did the company
of better men.</p>
               <p>But I will more particularly give
you a Character<note n="*" place="margin">How <hi>Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> carried it to good men when they came to visit him in his last sickness.</note> of his carriage
to good men (and good talk) when
they came to see him.</p>
               <p>1. When they were come, he
would seem to fail in his spirits at the
sight of them.</p>
               <p>2. He would not care to answer
them to any of those questions that
they would at times put to him, to
feel what sence he had of sin, death,
Hell, and Judgment: But would
either say nothing, or answer them
by way of evasion, or else by telling
of them he was so weak and spent
that he could not speak much.</p>
               <p>3. He would never shew for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness
to speak to, or talk with


<pb n="311" facs="tcp:48337:170"/>
them, but was glad when they held
their tongues. He would ask them
no question about his state and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world, or how he should es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
that damnation that he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>
               <p>4. He had got a haunt at last to
bid his wife and keeper, when these
good people attempted to come to
see him, to tell them that he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep
or inclining to sleep, or so weak
for want thereof, that he could not
abide any noyse. And so they
would serve them time after time,
till at last they were discouraged
from coming to see him any
more.</p>
               <p>5. He was so hardned, <hi>now,</hi> in
this time of his sickness, that he
would talk, when his companions
came unto him, to the disparagement
of those good men (and of their good
doctrine too) that of love did come
to see him, and that did labour to
convert him.</p>
               <p>6. When these good men went
away from him, he would never
say, Pray when will you be pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to come again, for I have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to more of your company, and


<pb n="312" facs="tcp:48337:171"/>
to hear more of your good instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
No not a word of that, but
when they were going would scarce
bid them drink, or say, Thank you
for your good company, and good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
               <p>7. His talk in his sickness with
his companions, would be of the
World, as Trades, Houses, Lands,
great Men, great Titles, great pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
outward Prosperity, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Adversity, or some such carnal
thing.</p>
               <p>By all which I conclude, that
he did not desire a sence and sight of
his sin, that he might repent and be
saved.</p>

               <p>What other signe can you

repentance?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>Why,<note place="margin">3 Proof that he died im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent.</note> he did never hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cry to God for mercy all the
time of his affliction. True, when
sinking fits, stitches, or pains took
hold upon him, then he would say
as other carnal men use to do,
<hi>Lord help me, Lord strengthen me,
Lord deliver me,</hi> and the like:
But to cry to God for mercy, that
he did not, but lay, as I hinted


<pb n="314" facs="tcp:48337:172"/>
before, as if he never had sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>That is another bad sign
indeed; for crying to God for mercy,
is one of the first signs of repentance.
When <hi>Paul</hi> lay repenting of his sin,
upon his bed, the Holy Ghost said
of him,<note place="margin">Acts 9. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Behold he prayes.</hi> But he
that hath not the first signs of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
'tis a sign he hath none of the
other, and so indeed none at all.
I do not say, but there may be cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
where there may be no sign of
repentance. <hi>They cryed,</hi> says <hi>David,
to the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 18. 41.</note> 
                  <hi>but he answered them
not;</hi> but that he would have done, if
their cry had been the fruit of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
But, I say, if men may cry and
yet have no repentance, be sure, they
have none, that cry not at all. It is
said in <hi>Job,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 36. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>They cry not when he
bindeth them;</hi> that is, because they
have no repentance; no repentance,
no cryes; false repentance, false cryes;
true repentance, true cryes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>I know that it is as possible
for a man to forbear crying that
hath repentance, as it is for a man to
forbear groaning that feeleth dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pain. He that looketh into the


<pb n="315" facs="tcp:48337:172"/>
Book of <hi>Psalms,</hi> (where repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is most lively set forth even
in its true and proper effects,)
shall there find, that crying, strong
crying, hearty crying, great crying,
and uncessant crying, hath been
the fruits of repentance: (But none
of this had this Mr. <hi>Badman,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he dyed in his sins.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Crying is an inseparable
effect of repentance, is seen in these
Scriptures.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 51. 1.</note> Have mercy upon me,
O God, according to the multitude
of thy tender mercies, blot out my trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions.
O Lord, rebuke me not in

Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath,
neither chasten me in thy hot displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
for thine arrows stick fast in me,
and thy hand presseth me sore. There
is no soundness in my flesh, because of
thine anger, neither is there any rest in
my bones, because of my sin. For mine
iniquities are gone over mine head,


<pb n="316" facs="tcp:48337:173"/>
as an heavy burthen, they are too heavy
for me. My wounds stink and are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt;
because of my foolishness. I am
troubled, I am bowed down greatly,
I goe mourning all the day long. My
loyns are filled with a loathsom disease,
and there is no soundness in my flesh.
I am feeble, and sore broken, I have
roared by reason of the disquietness of
my heart.</p>
               <p>I might give you a great number
more of the holy sayings of good
men, whereby they express how they
were, what they felt, and whether
they cryed or no, when repentance
was wrought in them. Alas, alas, it is
as possible for a man, when the
pangs of Guilt are upon him to
forbear praying, as it is for a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
when pangs of travel are upon
her to forbear crying. If all the
world should tell me that such a man
hath repentance, yet if he is not a
praying man, I should not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to believe it.</p>

you, by which you can prove that Mr.

Those who were his old sinfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
in the time of his health,
were those whose company and
carnal talk he most delighted in, in
the time of his sickness. I did occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally
hint this before, but now I
make it an argument of his want of
grace: for where there is indeed a
work of Grace in the heart, that
work doth not only change the
heart, thoughts and desires, but the
conversation also; yea conversation
and company too. When <hi>Paul</hi> had a
work of grace in his soul, he assayed
to Joyn himself to the Disciples. He
was for his old companions in their
abominations no longer: he was now
a Disciple,<note place="margin">Acts. 9. 26. 28.</note> and was for the company
of Disciples. <hi>And he was with them
coming in and going out in</hi> Jerusalem.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>I thought something when
I heard you make mention of it before.
Thought I, this is a shrewd sign that
he had not grace in his heart. Birds of
a feather, thought I, will flock together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
If this man was one of Gods child<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he would heard with Gods children,


<pb n="318" facs="tcp:48337:174"/>
his delight would be with, and in
the company of Gods children. As
<hi>David</hi> said,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 63.</note> I am a companion of all

               <p>You say well, for what fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
hath he that believeth with
an Infidel? And although it be true,
that all that joyn to the godly are not
godly, yet they that shall inwardly
choose the company of the ungodly
and open profane, rather than the
company of the godly, as Mr. <hi>Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
did; surely are not godly men,
but profane. He was, as I told you, out
of his element, when good men did
come to visit him, but then he was
where he would be, when he had
his vain companions about him.
Alas! grace, as I said, altereth <hi>all,</hi>
heart, life, company, and all; for by
it the <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>man</hi> is made new:
and a new heart, a new man, must
have objects of delight that are new,

his fellow sinners, would, even in

him, have been a burden and a grief
unto him. His heart and affection

But his Companions were his old

therefore his heart and soul were

he could endure company, and much

he should recover and not die, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he had cause to think, when he
was quite wasted with pining sickness,
when he was at the graves mouth. But
how was he, I say, when he was (as

to standers by, so much as a strong

            <sp>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>Not for mine own sake,
but for others. For there is such
<note n="*" place="margin">The opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ignoront about his manner of dying.</note> an opinion as this among the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant:
That if a man dies, as they
call it, like a Lamb, that is, quietly,
and without that consternation of
mind that others shew in their death,
they conclude, and that beyond all
doubt, that such an one is gone to
Heaven, and is certainly escaped the
wrath to come.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>There is no Judgment to
be made by a quiet death, of the
Eternal state of him that so dieth.
Suppose one man should die quietly,
another should die suddenly, and
a third should die under-great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation
of spirit; no man can
Judge of their eternall condition by
the manner of any of these kinds
of deaths. He that dies quietly,
suddenly, or under consternation of
spirit, may goe to Heaven, or may
goe to Hell; no man can tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a man goes, by <hi>any such</hi> manner


<pb n="322" facs="tcp:48337:176"/>
of death. The<note n="*" place="margin">How we must judge whether men dye well or no.</note> Judgment therefore
that we make of the eternall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of a man, must be gathered
from another consideration: To
wit, Did the man die in his sins?
did he die in unbelief? did he die
before he was born again? then he
is gone to the Devil and hell, though
he died never so quietly. Again,
Was the man a good man? had he
<hi>faith</hi> and <hi>holiness?</hi> was he a <hi>lover</hi> and
a <hi>Worshipper</hi> of <hi>God</hi> by Christ, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his Word? Then he is gone
to God and Heaven, how suddenly,
or in what consternation of mind
soever he died: But Mr. <hi>Badman</hi>
was naught, his life was evil, his
<hi>wayes</hi> were evil; evil to his end:
he therefore went to Hell and to
the Devil, how quietly soever he
died.</p>
               <p>Indeed there is, in some cases, a
Judgment to be made of a mans
eternal condition by the manner
of the death he dieth.<note n="*" place="margin">When we may judge of a mans eternal state by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his death.</note> As suppose
now a man should murder himself,
or live a wicked life, and after that
die in utter despair; these men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt do both of them goe to
Hell. And here I will take an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion


<pb n="323" facs="tcp:48337:176"/>
to speak of two of Mr. <hi>Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
Brethren, (for you know I told
you before that he had Brethren,)
and of the manner of their death.
One of them killed himself, and
the other after a wicked life died in
utter despair. Now I should not be
afraid to conclude of both these, that
they went by, and through their
death to hell.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>Pray tell me concerning
the first, how he made away him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>Why, he took a knife and
cut his own <hi>Throat,</hi> and immediately
gave up the Ghost and died. Now
what can we judge of such a mans
condition; since the Scripture saith,
<hi>No murderer hath eternall life,</hi> &amp;c.
but that it must be concluded, that
such an one is gone to Hell. He was
a murderer, a Self-murderer; and
he is the worst murderer, one that
slays his own body and soul: nor
doe we find mention made of any
but cursed ones that doe such kind of
deeds. I say, no mention made in
holy Writ of any others, but such,
that murder themselves.</p>
               <p>And this is a sore Judgment of


<pb n="324" facs="tcp:48337:177"/>
God upon men, when God shall;
for the sins of such, give them up
to be their own Executioners, or
rather to execute his Judgment and
Anger upon themselves. And let me
earnestly give this Caution to sinners.
<hi>Take heed, Sirs, break off your sins, lest

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi>
(named <hi>John Cox</hi>) that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
himself; the manner of his
doing of it was thus. He was a poor
man, and had for some time been
sick (and the time of his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
was about the beginning of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thoughts how he should live after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,


<pb n="325" facs="tcp:48337:177"/>
if he lost his present season
of work, he fell into deep despair
about the world, and cryed out to
his wife the morning before he kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elf, saying, <hi>We are undone.</hi>
But quickly after, he desired his
wife to depart the room, Because,
said he, I will see if I can get any
rest; so she went out: but he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of sleeping, quickly took his
<hi>Raisor,</hi> and therewith cut up a
great hole in his side, out of which
he pulled, and cut off some of his
guts, and threw them, with the
blood up and down the Chamber.
But this not speeding of him so soon
as he desired, he took the same Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
and therewith cut his own throat.
His wife then hearing of him sigh
and fetch his wind short, came again
into the room to him, and seeing
what he had done, she ran out and
called in some Neighbours, who
came to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where he lay in a
bloody manner, frightfull to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.
Then said one of them to him,
Ah! <hi>John,</hi> what have you done?
are you not sorry for what you have
done? He answered roughly, <hi>'Tis
too late to be sorry.</hi> Then said the


<pb n="326" facs="tcp:48337:178"/>
same person to him again, Ah! <hi>John,</hi>
pray to God to forgive thee this
bloody act of thine. At the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of which Exhortation, he seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
much offended, and in angry man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
said, <hi>Pray!</hi> and with that flung
himself away to the wall, and so after
a few gasps died desperately. When
he had turned him of his back, to
the wall, the blood ran out of his
belly as out of a boul, and soaked
quite through the bed to the boards,
and through the chinks to the boards
it ran pouring down to the ground.
Some said, that when the neighbours
came to see him, he lay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>roaping
with his hand in his bowels, reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upward, as was thought, that
he might have pulled or cut out
his heart. 'Twas said also, that some
of his Liver had been by him torn
out and cast upon the boards, and
that many of his guts hung out of the
bed on the side thereof. But I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
confirm all particulars; but the
general of the story, with these cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
above mentioned, is
true; I had it from a sober and credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
person, who himself was one
that saw him in this bloody state,


<pb n="327" facs="tcp:48337:178"/>
and that talked with him, as was
hinted before.</p>
               <p>Many other such dreadful things
might be told you, but these are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and too many too, if God
in his wisdom had thought necessary
to prevent them.</p>

gives them up to doe as <hi>John Cox</hi>
hath done. For surely self-murderers
cannot go to Heaven: and therefore,
as you have said, he that dieth by his
own hands, is certainly gone to Hell.

Gods Judgements. Well, after he

had lived a great while in his sins,
God smote with a sickness of which
he died. Now in his sickness his
Conscience began to be awakened,
and he began to roar out of his ill-spent
Life, insomuch that the Town
began to ring of him. Now when
it was noysed about, many of the
Neighbours came to see him, and
to read by him, as is the common
way with some; but all that they
could doe, could not abate his ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,

I set my self to collect these dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Stories, it would be easie in

of them: But I will conclude
as I began; They that are their

               <p>And here I would put in a Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Every one that dieth under
consternation of spirit; that is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
amazement and great fear, do
not therefore die in Despair: For
a good man may have this for his
bands in his death,<note place="margin">Psal. 73. 4.</note> and yet go to
Heaven and Glory. For, as I said
before, He that is a <hi>good</hi> man, a

a <hi>lover</hi> and <hi>Worshipper</hi> of God by
Christ, according to his Word, may
die in consternation of spirit: for
Satan will not be wanting to assault
good men upon their death-bed,
but they are secured by the Word
and Power of God; yea, and are
also helped, though with much ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of spirit, to exercise themselves
in Faith and Prayer, the which he


<pb n="330" facs="tcp:48337:180"/>
that dieth in Despair, can by no
means doe. But let us return to

               <p>With all my heart.<note place="margin">Further dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of Mr. <hi>Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> death.</note> You
know we were speaking before of
the manner of Mr. <hi>Badmans</hi> death:
How that he dyed very stilly and
quietly; upon which you made ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
that the common people
conclude, that if a man dyes quietly,
and as they call it, like a Lamb, he is
certainly gone to Heaven: when
alas, if a wicked man dyes quietly,
if a man that has all his dayes lived
in notorious sin, dyeth quietly; his
quiet dying is so far off from being a
sign of his being saved, that it is
an uncontrollable proof of his dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
This was Mr. <hi>Badmans</hi>
case, he lived wickedly even to the
last, and then went quietly out of the


<pb n="331" facs="tcp:48337:180"/>
world: therefore Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> is gone
to Hell.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Att.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but since you are upon it,
and also so confident in it, to wit, that
a man that lives a wicked life till he
dyes, and then dyes quietly, is gone to
Hell; let me see what shew of proof
you have for this your opinion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>My first argument is drawn
from <hi>the Necessity of repentance:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a sinfull life dies qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly, that is, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, goes to Hell.</note> No
man can be saved except he repents,
nor can he repent that sees not, that
knows not that he is a sinner, and he
that knows himself to be a sinner,<note place="margin">1 Proof.</note>
will, I will warrant him, be molest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the time by that knowledge.
This, as it is testified by all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
so it is testified by Christian
experience. He that knows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be a sinner, is molested, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if that knowledge comes not
to him untill he is cast upon his
death-bed; molested, I say, before
he can dye quietly. Yea, he is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lested,
dejected and cast down, he
is also made to cry out, to hunger
and thirst after mercy by Christ, and
if at all he shall indeed come to dye
quietly, I mean with that quietness
that is begotten by Faith and Hope


<pb n="332" facs="tcp:48337:181"/>
in Gods mercy (to the which Mr.
<hi>Badman</hi> and his brethren were utter
strangers,) his quietness is distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
by all Judicious observers,
by what w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt before it, by what it
flows from, and also by what is the
fruit thereof.</p>
               <p>I must confess I am no admirer
of sick-bed repentance, for I think
verily it is seldom<note n="*" place="margin">Sick-bed repentance seldom good for any thing.</note> good for any
thing: but I say, he that hath lived
in sin and profaneness all his dayes, as
Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> did, and yet shall dye
quietly, that is, without repentance
steps in 'twixt his life and death,
he is assuredly gone to Hell, and is
damned.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Atten.</speaker>
               <p>This does look like an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
indeed; for Repentance must
come, or else we must goe to Hell-fire:
and if a lewd liver shall (I mean that
so continues till the day of his death,)
yet goe out of the world quietly, 'tis a
sign that he dyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and so a sign that he is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>I am satisfied in it, for my
part, and that from the Necessity,
and Nature of repentance. It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
because God calls for it, and


<pb n="333" facs="tcp:48337:181"/>
will not pardon sin without it: <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
ye repent ye shall all likewise pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 13. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</note>
This is that which God hath
said, and he will prove but a fool-hardy
man that shall yet think to goe
to Heaven and glory without it.
<hi>Repent, for the Ax is laid to the root
of the tree, every tree therefore that
bringeth not forth good fruit,</hi> (but
no good fruit can be where there is
not sound repentance) <hi>shall be hewn
down, and cast into the fire.</hi> This
was Mr. <hi>Badmans</hi> case, he had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
of him a sinfull life, and that
to the very last, and yet dyed qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly,
that is, without repentance;
he is gone to Hell and is damned.
For the Nature of repentance, I have
touched upon that already, and
shewed, that it never was where a
quiet death is the immediate compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of a sinfull life; and therefore
Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> is gone to Hell.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2 Proof.</note> My second argument
is drawn from that blessed Word of
Christ, <hi>While the strong man armed
keeps the house, his goods are in peace,
till a stronger than he comes:</hi> but the
strong man armed kept Mr. <hi>Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
house, that is, his <hi>heart,</hi> and


<pb n="334" facs="tcp:48337:182"/>
                  <hi>soul,</hi> and <hi>body,</hi> for he went from a
sinfull life <hi>quietly</hi> out of this world:
the stronger did not disturb by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
with sound repentance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
his sinful life and his quiet
death: Therefore Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> is
gone to Hell.</p>
               <p>The strong man armed is the
Devil, and quietness is his security.
The Devil never fears losing of the
sinner, if he can but keep him quiet:
can he but keep him quiet in a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
life, and quiet in his death, he is
his own. Therefore he saith, <hi>his
goods are in peace;</hi> that is, out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
There is no fear of the Devils
losing such a soul, I say, because
Christ, who is the best Judge in this
matter, saith, <hi>his goods are in peace,</hi>
in quiet, and out of danger.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
               <p>So it is. Therefore, when
God would shew the greatness of his
anger against sin and sinners in <hi>one</hi>
word, he saith, <hi>They are joyned to
Idols,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hos. 4. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>let them alone.</hi> Let them alone,
that is, disturb them not; let them


<pb n="335" facs="tcp:48337:182"/>
goe on without controll; let the
Devil enjoy them peaceably, let him
carry them out of the world uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
quietly. This is one of the
sorest of Judgments, and bespeaketh
the burning anger of God against sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
men. See also when you come
home, the fourteenth Verse of the
Chapter last mentioned in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent:
<hi>I will not punish your daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
when they commit Whoredom.</hi>
I will let them alone, they shall live
and dye in their sins. But,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3 Proof.</note> 
                  <hi>My third argument is
drawn from</hi> that <hi>saying of Christ:</hi>
He hath blinded their eyes,<note place="margin">Joh. 12. 40.</note> and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
their hearts; that they should
not see with their eyes, nor understand
with their hearts, and be converted,
and I should heal them.</p>
               <p>There are three things that I will
take notice of from these words.</p>
               <p>1. The first is, That there can be
no conversion to God where the eye
is darkned, and the heart hardened.
The eye must first be made to see,
and the heart to break and relent
under and for sin, or else there can
be no conversion. He hath blinded
their eyes, and hardned their hearts,


<pb n="336" facs="tcp:48337:183"/>
                  <hi>lest they should see, and understand
and</hi> (So) <hi>be converted.</hi> And this was
clearly Mr. <hi>Badmans</hi> case, he lived
a wicked life, and also died with
his eyes shut, and heart hardened,
as is manifest, in that a sinful life was
joyned with a quiet death; and all
for that he should not be converted,
but partake of the fruit of his sinfull
life in Hell fire.</p>
               <p>2. The second thing that I take
notice of from these words is, That
this is a dispensation and manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Gods anger against a man
for his sin. When God is angry
with men, I mean, when he is so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
with them, this among many
is one of the Judgments that he
giveth them up unto, to wit, to
blindness of mind, and hardness of
heart, which he also suffereth to
accompany them till they enter in
at the gates of death. And <hi>then,</hi>
and <hi>there,</hi> and not short of <hi>then</hi>
and <hi>there,</hi> their eyes come to be
opened. Hence it is said of the
rich man mentioned in <hi>Luke, He dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and in Hell he lift up his eyes:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 16. 22.</note>
Implying that he did not lift them up
before: He neither saw what he had


<pb n="337" facs="tcp:48337:183"/>
done, nor whither he was going, till
he came to the place of execution,
even into Hell. He died asleep in
his soul; he dyed besotted, stupified,
and so consequently for quietness,
like a Child or Lamb, even as Mr.
<hi>Badman</hi> did: this was a sign of Gods
anger; he had a mind to damn him
for his sins, and therefore would
not let him see nor have an heart to
repent for them, lest he should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert,
and his damnation, which God
had appointed, should be frustrate:
<hi>lest they should be converted, and I
should heal them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The third thing that I take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of from hence, is, That a sinfull
life and a quiet death annexed to it,
is the ready, the open, the beaten,
the common high-way to Hell: there
is no surer sign of Damnation, than
for a man to dye quietly after a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
life. I do not say that all wicked
men, that are molested at their death
with a sence of sin and fears of Hell,
do therefore goe to Heaven, (for
some are also made to see, and are
left to despair (not converted by see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
that they might go roaring out
of this world to their place:) But I


<pb n="338" facs="tcp:48337:184"/>
say, there is no surer sign of a mans
Damnation, than to dye quietly
after a sinful life; than to sin, and
dye with his eyes shut; than to sin,
and dye with an heart that cannot
repent.<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>He hath blinded their eyes
and hardened their heart, that they
should not see with their eyes, nor
understand with their heart;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 28. 26, 27.</note> (no,
not so long as they are in this world)
<hi>lest they should see with their eyes,
and understand with their heart, and
should be converted, and I should heal
them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God has a Judgment for wicked
men; God will be even with wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men:<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>God knows how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the ungodly to the day of
Judgment to be punished:</hi> And this
is one of his wayes by which he
doth it. Thus it was with Mr. <hi>Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Fourthly,<note place="margin">4 Proof.</note> It is said in the Book
of <hi>Psalms,</hi> concerning the wicked,
<hi>There is no b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nds in their death,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 73. 4, 5, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>but
their strength is firm.</hi> By <hi>no</hi> bands,
he means <hi>no</hi> troubles, no <hi>gracious</hi>
chastisements, <hi>no</hi> such corrections
for sin as fall to be the Lot of Gods
people for theirs; yea, that many


<pb n="339" facs="tcp:48337:184"/>
times falls to be theirs, at the time
of their death. Therefore he adds
concerning the wicked, <hi>They are not
troubled</hi> (then) <hi>like other men, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are they plagued like other men;</hi>
but go as securely out of the world,
as if they had never sinned against
God, and put their own souls into
danger of damnation. <hi>There is no
band in their death.</hi> They seem to
go unbound, and set at liberty, out
of this world, though they have lived
notoriously wicked all their dayes
in it. The Prisoner that is to dye
at the Gallows for his wickedness,
must first have his Irons knock't off
his legs; so he seems to goe most at
liberty, when indeed he is going to
be executed for his transgressions.
Wicked men also have <hi>no</hi> bands in
their death, they seem to be more
at liberty when they are even at the
Wind-up of their sinfull life, than at
any time besides.</p>
               <p>Hence you shall have them boast
of their Faith and Hope in Gods
Mercy, when they lye upon their
death-bed; yea, you shall have
them speak as confidently of their
salvation, as if they had served God


<pb n="340" facs="tcp:48337:185"/>
all their dayes: when the truth is, the
bottom of this their boasting is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have no <hi>bands</hi> in their
death.</p>
               <p>Their sin and base life comes not
into their mind to correct them, and
bring them to repentance; but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
thoughts, and an hope and
faith of the Spiders (the Devils)
making,<note place="margin">Job 8. 13, 14.</note> possesseth their soul, to their
own eternal undoing.</p>
               <p>Hence wicked mens hope, is said
to dye, not before, but with them;
they give up the Ghost together.
And thus did Mr. <hi>Badman.</hi> His sins
and his hope went with him to the
Gate, but there his hope left him,
because it dyed there; but his sins
went in with him, to be a worm to
gnaw him in his conscience for ever
and ever.</p>
               <p>The opinion therefore of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people concerning this kind of
dying, is<note n="*" place="margin">A frivolous opinion.</note> frivolous and vain; for
Mr. <hi>Badman</hi> died like a Lamb, or as
they call it, like a <hi>Chrisom</hi> child, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
and without fear. I speak not this
with reference to the strugling of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with death, but as to the strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the conscience with the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment


<pb n="341" facs="tcp:48337:185"/>
of God. I know that Nature
will struggle with death. I have seen
a <hi>Dog</hi> and <hi>Sheep</hi> dye hardly: And
thus may a wicked man doe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is an antipathy betwixt
nature and death. But even while,
even then, when Death and Nature
are strugling for mastery, the soul,
the conscience, may be as besotted,
as benummed, as senceless and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of its miserable state, as the
block or bed on which the sick lyes:
And thus they may dye like a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som</hi>
child in shew, but indeed like
one who by the Judgment of God is
bound over to eternal damnation;
and that also by the same Judgment
is kept from seeing what they
are, and whither they are going,
till they plunge down among the
flames.</p>
               <p>And as it is a very great Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God on wicked men that
so dye, (for it cuts them off from
all possibility of repentance, and so of
salvation)<note n="*" place="margin">When a wicked man dyes in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

children, as they call it, they are
hardened, and take courage to go
on in their course.</p>
               <p>For comparing their <hi>life</hi> with their
<hi>death,</hi> their <hi>sinful</hi> cursed lives with
their <hi>child-like, Lamb-like</hi> death,
they think that all is well, that no
damnation is happened to them;
Though they lived like Devils incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
yet they dyed like harmless
ones. There was no whirl-wind,
no tempest, no band, nor plague in
their death: They dyed as quietly as
the most godly of them all, and had
as great faith and hope of salvation,
and would talk as boldly of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as if they had assurance of it.
But as was their hope in life, so was
their death: Their hope was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
tryal, because it was none of
Gods working, and their death was
without molestation, because so
was the Judgment of God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them.</p>
               <p>But I say, at this their survivers
take heart to tread their steps, and to
continue to live in the breach of the
Law of God; yea they carry it stateli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in their villanies; for so it follows
in the <hi>Psalm. There is no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Therefore they take courage to
do evil, therefore they pride them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in their iniquity. Therefore,
Wherefore? Why, because their
fellows died, after they had lived
long in a most profane and wicked
life, as quietly and as like to Lambs,
as if they had been innocent.</p>
               <p>Yea, they are bold, by seeing
this, to conclude, that God, either
does not, or will not take notice of
their sins.<note place="margin">Ver. 8. 9, 10, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>They speak wickedly, they

concerning oppression, that they
commend, and count it a prudent
act. They also speak loftily: <hi>They set
their mouth against the Heavens,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>And they say, How doth God know,
and is there knowledge in the most
High?</hi> And all this, so far as I can
see, ariseth in their hearts from the
beholding of the quiet and lamb-like
death of their companions.</p>

               <p>Yea, this is enough to puzzle the

to a stand, by beholding the quiet
death of ungodly men. <hi>Verily,</hi> sayes

he, <hi>I have cleansed my heart in vain, and have

They, to appearance fare better by far than I:
<hi>Their eyes stand out with fatness, they have
more than heart can wish; But all the day
long have I been plagued, and chastned every
morning.</hi> This, I say, made <hi>David</hi> wonder,
yea, and <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> too: But he goeth
into the Sanctuary, and then he understands
their end, nor could he understand it before.
<hi>I went into the Sanctuary of God:</hi> What
place was that? why there where he might
enquire of God, and by him be resolved of
this matter: <hi>Then,</hi> says he, <hi>understood I their
end.</hi> Then I saw, that <hi>thou hast set them in
slippery places,</hi> and that <hi>thou castest them
down to destruction.</hi> Castest them down,
that is, suddenly, or as the next words say,
<hi>As in a moment they are utterly consumed
with terrors:</hi> which terrors did not cease
them on their sick-bed, for they had <hi>no
bands</hi> in their death. The terrors therefore
ceased them there, where also they are holden
in them for ever. This he found out, I say,
but not without great painfulness, grief and
pricking in his reins: so deep, so hard and
so difficult did he find it, rightly to come to
a determination in this matter.</p>

flies away for ever: Then they roar like
Lions, yell like Dragons, howl like Dogs,
and tremble at their Judgment, as do the
Devils themselves. Oh! when they see they
must shoot the Gulf and Throat of Hell!
when they shall see that Hell hath shut her
ghastly Jaws upon them! when they shall

open their eyes, and find themselves within
the belly and bowels of Hell! then they will
mourn, and weep, and hack, and gnash their
teeth for pain. But this must not be (or if it
must, yet very rarely) till they are gone out of
the sight and hearing of those mortals whom
they do leave behind them alive in the world.</p>

I perceive that the Sun grows low, and that you

Life and Death; and therefore I will take my
leave of you. Only first, let me tell you, I am
glad that I have met with you to day, and
that our hap was to full in with Mr. <hi>Badmans</hi>
state. I also thank you for your freedom with
me, in granting of me your reply to all my que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions:
I would only beg your Prayers, that God
will give me much grace, that I may neither
live nor die as did Mr. <hi>Badman.</hi>
