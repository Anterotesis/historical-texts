            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶A dittie
In the worthie praiſe of an high
and mightie Prince.</head>
            <l>WHen heapes of heauie hap, had fild my harte right full,</l>
            <l>And ſorrow ſet forth penſiuenes, my ioyes away to pull:</l>
            <l>I raunged then the woods, I romde the fields aboute,</l>
            <l>A thouſand ſighes I ſet at large, to ſéeke their paſſage out.</l>
            <l>And walkyng in a dompe, or rather in diſpaire,</l>
            <l>I caſt my wéeping eye a ſide, I ſaw a fielde full faire:</l>
            <l>And lokyng vpwarde than, I ſpied a Mount therein,</l>
            <l>Which <hi>Flora</hi> had euen for her life, dect as you haue not ſéen.</l>
            <l>Then could I not but thinke the ſame ſome ſacred place,</l>
            <l>Where God or Goddes ſuch did dwell, as might releue my caſe:</l>
            <l>I ſat me downe, for whie? Death could but ſtop my breath,</l>
            <l>And to a man ſo ſorrowfull, what ſweter is then death?</l>
            <l>No ſooner was I ſet, but ſlepe approcht mine eye,</l>
            <l>Wherein the Nymphes of <hi>Helicon</hi> appeared by and by.</l>
            <l>And ſtraight thoſe ſiſters nine, the ground of Muſicks arte,</l>
            <l>My thought did ſtriue who might preuaile, to eaſe my heauie harte.</l>
            <l>The cunning they ſhewed there, the ſubtile notes they ſoung,</l>
            <l>As w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a wreſt clene from my hart (my thought) the cares they wrong:</l>
            <l>Celeſtiall were the notes, which then (amazde) I hearde,</l>
            <l>Their ditties eke were wonderfull, note ye whome they preferde.</l>
            <l>As for thy bloud (ꝙ they) right noble we confeſſe,</l>
            <l>Thy pettigrée (to long for vs) the Heralds can expreſſe.</l>
            <l>But happie happie Duke, the ſecond chylde of Fame,</l>
            <l>Which (next vnto the higheſt) ſhe doth ſo recoumpt the ſame.</l>
            <l>And happie Thomas ones, twiſe happie Norffolke toe,</l>
            <l>Thriſe happie men that leade your liues, where Howard hath to doe:</l>
            <l>Which Howards happie daies, they praied God to encreaſe,</l>
            <l>Thrée times the ſpace of Natures courſe, like <hi>Nestor</hi> liue in peace.</l>
            <l>What age hath ſéen his like, ſo frée of purſe and toung?</l>
            <l>Where liues a iuſter Iuſtice now, though rare in one ſo young?</l>
            <l>What plaint can there be tolde, to his moſt godlie eare?</l>
            <l>But that he kepes the other ſtyll, the blamed ſoule to heare?</l>
            <l>In mekenes he more meke, then is the mekeſt Doue,</l>
            <l>Yet is his ſecret wiſedome ſuch, he knoweth whome to loue:</l>
            <l>In fréendſhip, he ſurmounts <hi>Giſippus</hi> and his <hi>Tite,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>All Nobles may well note his race, and thereby take their lighte.</l>
            <l>In peace a <hi>Salomon,</hi> in warre ſo ſtoute a Prince,</l>
            <l>As raigned not tyll <hi>Hector</hi> came, nor liued neuer ſince:</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Sceuola,</hi> more firme, which for his cuntries turne,</l>
            <l>His hand from arme before his foes, in fierie ſlame did burne.</l>
            <l>He in the pride of peace, delights in marciall ſhowe,</l>
            <l>Doe marke his turnoys vpon horſe, note well his vſe of bowe.</l>
            <l>Nay marke him yet that ſhall, note well his paynefulnes,</l>
            <l>No ſugred ſlepe can make him fréend to ſluggiſh Idlenes.</l>
            <l>What that becomes a Prince, in his good grace doth want?</l>
            <l>In peace, a courtier for the Courte, a ſecond <hi>Mars</hi> in camp.</l>
            <l>Thus ſtyll they ſoung, whoſe notes were cauſe of my reléefe,</l>
            <l>And I be wrapped in a Traunce, had cleane forgot my gréefe:</l>
            <l>And triple were my ioyes, ones, cauſe my paynes were paſt,</l>
            <l>And twiſe agayne, becauſe that Prince amongſt vs here is plaſt.</l>
            <l>I clapt my handes for ioye (alas) I wakt withall,</l>
            <l>And then my muſes and their ſonges, my ioyes were gone and all.</l>
            <l>And then retournd my gréefe, I felt a further care,</l>
            <l>Becauſe to ſhew what I had ſéen, did paſſe my power ſo farre:</l>
            <l>And that a man vnlearnd, of arte that hath no ſkyll,</l>
            <l>Should haue a charge ſo great as this, and could doe it ſo yll.</l>
            <l>Yet thus I gan to wright, I knew right well that he,</l>
            <l>Which due deſert did thus commend, ſhould ſhade the want in me:</l>
            <l>To whome I pray the Lorde, to ſend like yeares a <hi>Noye</hi>
            </l>
            <l>In happie health and quiet ſtate, to his and all our ioye.</l>
