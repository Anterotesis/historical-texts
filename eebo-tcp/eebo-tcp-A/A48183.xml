            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>IN Reading ſomewhat of the Crown-Law this Vacation, I met with a Caſe of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, which occaſioned me ſome thoughts; I would deſire your Opinion thereon, my firſt Conceptions upon it I herewith ſend you: You know that by the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. it is ſaid to be Treaſon to Compaſs or Imagine the Death of our Lord the King; our Lady his Companion, or of their Eldeſt Son and <hi>Heir,</hi> &amp;c. Upon reading of which Statute there ſeemed to me to ariſe a conſiderable Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion from the laſt words of that Clauſe, <hi>viz. If a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral Heir be not there meant as well as Lineal?</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60871:3"/>
my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> determines it in the Negative, yet conſidering how the Law ſtood before this Act of Parliament, and what was the general end why the Common-Law made, and this Statute allowed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing or Imagination of the Death of the King's El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Son and Heir to be High-Treaſon, and the equality of the miſchief to the Publick in the Death of a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral Heir with that of a Lineal, and the neceſſity and deſign of the Law for the Preſervation of the Royal Line in both theſe Caſes: Conſidering theſe things, I cannot upon firſt thoughts perſuade my ſelf any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but that a Brother or Uncle being next Heir was intended by that Law as much as a Son, if there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be ſuch. For it muſt be agreed that at the Common-Law, before this Statute, it was Treaſon to Kill, or to Compaſs the Death of the King's Heir, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lineal or Collateral; nay it was held to be Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in caſe of any of the King's Children, or Uncle, or other near Relatives, though ſuch were not Next, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, Expectant Heir, but only of the Royal Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and remote by ſome Degrees from any appearance of Succeſſion to the Crown. And this is even agreed by <hi>Andrew Horne</hi> and the Lord <hi>Coke</hi> themſelves, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which were ſuch friends to the Crown as to be ſuſpected of flattery or Biaſs in this particular: Now that this Statute alters not the caſe is plain, for it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to be an Act declaratory of the Ancient Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law, and not introductive of a novelty; 'tis true, it is Abrogatory of all Treaſons not therein expreſſed, and reſtrains Treaſon to the particulars which it ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies; although the words are Eldeſt Son and <hi>Heir,</hi> which is to be ſuppoſed the firſt Born, yet it is agreed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60871:3"/>
that if ſuch firſt Born die without Iſſue, the ſecond Son, being the Eldeſt <hi>Living,</hi> is within this Law, and ſo of the third Son, which is a conſtruction far from Literal, and yet conſented to by all Lawyers that I have read; now ſuch interpretation of thoſe words (though this be in ſome for a Penal Law) proceeds from the common rule in expoſition of Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, even thoſe which are Penal, that thoſe caſes which ſtand upon the ſame Reaſon ſhall be within the ſame Law, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi eadem ratio ibi idem erit jus,</hi> be the Law what it will; where there is the ſame Identity or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of Reaſon in any caſe, there ought to be the ſame Rule; Beſides this is not ſuch a Penal Law as is meant in that rule of Expoſitions of not being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by Equity, for thoſe Penal Laws are ſuch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as create new Offences or inflict new Puniſhments, of which ſort you cannot reckon this in queſtion. For if you conſider the end and deſign of this Law, 'twas not to either of thoſe purpoſes, but to declare what things our then Law-makers thought fit to be reckoned and allowed Treaſon from thenceforward; then conſider the end why thoſe particulars there mentioned were agreed ſhould be Treaſon for ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, and the conſideration thereof will make this perſpicuous, peruſe the Act and take it apart or the whole together, and you will find it either to concern the Kings Perſon, the Kings Heirs, or the Kingly Government, the three Miſchiefs deſigned to be prevented were, Bodily harm to the Kings moſt Sacred Perſon, the Extirpation of the Royal Family and Deſtruction of Kingly Government; All which three are by this Act expreſly provided againſt; The
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60871:4"/>
third and laſt in the clauſes of Levying War, adhering to the Kings Enemies, Clipping or Counterfeiting Mony or the Great Seal, or Killing any of his Grand Officers there particulariſed, the Sole Power of making War and Peace, commanding Subjects to aſſiſt againſt For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Enemies, ordering and regulating Currant Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, Cuſtody and Management of the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> and conſequently of Pardons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and removing of all Publick Officers of State and Juſtice, being ſome of the Royal Prerogatives of <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> Monarch: The firſt is apparent in the firſt words of this Act, whereby it is made High-Treaſon ſo much as to think evil of the King in a Mans Heart; the ſecond is no leſs manifeſt, although ſome of Republican Principles are unwilling it ſhould be ſo, and therefore will ſay it is not ſo, but 'tis as plain as either of the two former which I have mentioned, for that's the end and reaſon why 'tis High-Treaſon to compaſs the Death of the Queen, and the Words are Emphatical, Our Lady his <hi>Companion,</hi> and their Heir; Then, which nothing can be more fully expreſſed; 'tis eaſie for you further to animadvert on the ſenſe of the Words, and their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence; It not being placed among the Grandees of the Realm as the greateſt Subject, but between the King and His Heir; And <hi>Heir</hi> ſurely is the principal thing there intended, and this Statute (you muſt needs imagine) deſigned by that clauſe to preſerve the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Family and maintain the Succeſſion, by providing a ſecurity for the Succeſſor from all Danger as to his Perſon: Now a Collateral Heir is in the ſame plight and condition in reſpect of the Kingdom as a Son and Heir; and to deſtroy the Brother, may be of as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60871:4"/>
pernicious conſequence as to cut off the Son, as is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy for any Man to conceive, by conſidering the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal effects which may happen upon either, as the Extirpation of the Royal Family, (which God forbid) which was by this Law principally meant to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and involving the Nation in Blood and War, by rendring the Right of Succeſſion diſputable, ſo that the Miſchief that may happen in both Caſes, and that was intended to be prevented, is alike and the ſame. Then that this conſtruction is contrariant to any one rule of Law, I think no Man can affirm; if any do, I could with much facility evince its conſonancy to the rules of Law in other like Caſes, even of Statutes meerlyand ſtrictly Penal, by abundance of Books; But I know you will <hi>object</hi> that here's a reſtrictive Clauſe. <hi>I anſwer and confeſs, there is a Proviſo, That if any other Caſe ſuppoſed Treaſon, which is not above ſpecified, &amp;c.</hi> but this is ſpecified and ſufficiently expreſſed by the Word <hi>Heir,</hi> which was the thing chiefly intended, as I ſhew'd before in the threefold reaſon of this Act of Parliament; and a Brother or Nephew that is apparent Heir, being within the ſame reaſon and miſchief with Son and Heir, which was mentioned, becauſe he is (where there is ſuch) the firſt and next in Succeſſion, and ſo the chiefeſt of the kind is named, the reſt being meant and intended (and that in Acts of Parliament 'tis common and uſual only to mention the firſt and chiefeſt, when all manner of Perſons of that kind or ſort are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, you know almoſt an hundred Caſes for it then) the <hi>Primogenitus,</hi> the Eldeſt Son, in the firſt place, then in default of him, the ſecond Son, becauſe then Heir, then in default of him, the third Son, for the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60871:5"/>
ſame Reaſon, becauſe Son, then Heir; and this is agreed to notwithſtanding the reſtrictive Clauſe, <hi>&amp; pari ratione,</hi> If no ſuch Son, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then Brother or Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, when and becauſe next immediate Apparent Heir in being. This conſtruction ſeems very natural and genuine; beſides that, were it otherwiſe, the Word <hi>Heir</hi> would be needleſs, and ſtand for a Cypher, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that Word <hi>Heir,</hi> 'twould have been ſufficient to have ſaid Eldeſt Son, and no more, if no more had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by this Clauſe: Now I think it is a Rule in all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, as well of Statutes as of Wills and Awards, (thoſe three receiving always one interpretation <hi>ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum Intentionem,</hi> which the very termination denotes, Parliament, Teſtament, and Arbitrement) never to expound them ſo as any Word ſhall be void and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, if all its Words may have a meaning by another Conſtruction; And here now if <hi>Coke</hi>'s Conſtruction be received, <hi>That no Heir is meant but Eldeſt Son,</hi> then 'tis as much as if they had ſaid Eldeſt Son, that is, Eldeſt Son, and the Word Heir is ſuperfluous, for a Mans El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Son is generally reputed Heir: Beſides, this Act being in Affirmance of the Common Law, you know the Judges are not bound to that literal, ſyllabical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as is pretended in this Caſe; and the Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Treaſons hath in all ages been conſtrued accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Rule I mentioned of an identity in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Miſchief: As in the Caſe of Petty Treaſon, you find in the Books, that if the Servant Kill the Wife of his Maſter, knowing her to be ſuch, 'tis adjudged Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Treaſon by all the Judges of both Benches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is the ſame reaſon for the one as the other, the one hath affiance in him as well as the other, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60871:5"/>
he ows reverence to them both: So for a Child to Kill Father or Mother, is Petty Treaſon, becauſe there's a majority of reaſon higher then that of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, which is the Submiſſion due from a Son to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and this very branch of this Act hath had the like Conſtruction, as that a Queen Regent is here meant, though literally. She be neither within the Words King nor Queen-conſort, yet becauſe She ſtands under the ſame reaſon and is in the ſame condition with a King in reſpect of the Kingdom and therefore Conſtrued ſo, as it was in Caſe of the late Queens, <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and ſo the Eldeſt ſon and Heir of a Queen Regent for the ſame reaſon. Further, it is obſervable that the Words are <hi>their</hi> Heir, and yet it cannot be denied that though ſuch Heir of the King be not Son of the Queen, but Eldeſt Son by a Conſort deceaſed before He came to the Crown, yet ſuch will be within this Statute, becauſe within the ſame reaſon, and the Kings Eldeſt Daughter (there being no Son) is ſurely within the Law, ſuch being the next in proſpect to the Crown: And ſeveral other Conſtructions there are upon this Statute, of perſons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by this Statute, though not literally expreſſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>in aequali Statu,</hi> as Keeper of the Great Seal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame in Power and Office with Chancellor, and many more which are obvious in almoſt every Book: And I can ſee no reaſon why ſuch Conſtruction ſhould be admitted upon one part of the Act, and ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently denied in this Clauſe; thence it ſeems very plain that a Collateral Heir, is as much within this Act as Son and Heir, for that upon reading of the Statute it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, the Law-makers deſigned the Preſervation of the Succeſſor under the term <hi>Heir,</hi> which muſt be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60871:6"/>
meant <hi>to the Crown:</hi> So Sacred a reſpect had our Law-makers in thoſe days to the Divine right of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. As for the Diſtinction of Preſumptive and Apparent, it is ſo idle and trivial that it needs not the leaſt anſwer, for they are often uſed promiſcuouſly one for the other, and a Brother whom perchance you will call preſumptive Heir is in default of a Son, as much an Heir apparent as any perſon can be (when there is ſuch) there being no intermediate Heir in being, and his Right is as Sacred and Inviolable, and his condition the ſame in reſpect of the Kingdom. For that ſaying of <hi>non eſt haeres viventis,</hi> it is of as little conſideration in this Caſe, for though it ſhould be agreed in ſtrictneſs true, yet the Word <hi>Heir</hi> ſuffices to deſcribe the perſon who is to ſucceed or inherit by Deſcent, and in the Civil Law, which Governs in moſt parts of the Civiliz'd World, is uſed for him that ſucceeds to a mans eſtate, whether he be of the blood or a ſtranger, whether he be ſo by Will or Deſcent. So that it is an emphatical name in this place for to expreſs the perſon intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this Law to be kept from violence, even in thought: But ſome may imagine this is to make Treaſon againſt an Heir while a Subject; You know that to be otherwiſe, for the Treaſon is againſt the King as well in this Caſe as that of the Queen-conſort, and all ſuch Offences are <hi>contra ligeantiam debitam Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino Regi;</hi> ſo 'tis in Felony and Murder, though the Act of Violence be an immediate wrong to the Goods or Perſon of a Subject, yet the offence is againſt the Kings Peace, Crown and Dignity, for he is intereſted in the Life and Welfare of his Subjects, and being more eſpecially and perſonally concerned in thoſe of

the Royal Family, the Law hath made ſuch Offence High-Treaſon; But perhaps you will object that the conſequence of this opinion will be to make Treaſon uncertain, and that ſuch thing as is ſo to day, may prove otherwiſe to morrow, by the Birth of a Son or the like; I anſwer that will be no inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience to any good Man, for every ſuch never dares to indulge himſelf in an ill thought of any of the Royal Blood, but beſides, 'twill be no more ſo upon this Conſtruction, then in the Caſe of Eldeſt Son, who dying, you agree the Second to come in his place within this Law, and the Treaſon is ſtill the ſame to Kill or to Imagine the Death of the next and immediate Apparent Heir, be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who it will, whether Son, Brother, Nephew, Uncle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You may perhaps further object, that this is contrary to the opinion of the Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Hales;</hi> For Anſwer thereto I need ſay no more than that the Reaſon of Laws, and not Authority, is the Good old Rule, <hi>Conſulendum &amp; judicandum legibus non dictis;</hi> But however, if you conſult <hi>Cokes</hi> opinion, you will find it very odd in this particular, he ſaith, If ſuch an Heir Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent be a Collateral Heir, (Note here that <hi>Coke</hi> himſelf ſtiles a Collateral Heir to be an Heir Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent) he is not within this Law until Declared in Parliament; <hi>i. e.</hi> until he be declared Heir, as was <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> Earl of <hi>March,</hi> in <hi>Richard</hi>

before. Then for the Lord <hi>Hales,</hi> 'tis true this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is mentioned in his Pleas of the Crown, but in the firſt Edition thereof it is with a <hi>tamen quaere;</hi> but it ſeems, ſome diſingenuous Dogmatiſt being of another mind, hath in the ſecond Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtruck out thoſe words <hi>tamen quaere,</hi> unwilling to let the world know that that Great, Good Man doubted of <hi>Cokes</hi> opinion in this particular, and in truth it was that <hi>tamen quaere</hi> made me firſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this matter. So that to draw to an end of this my too tedious Epiſtle, there ſeems to me nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther authority nor reaſon againſt this opinion, which to my preſent thoughts reſults moſt plainly from the conſideration of this Statute, and its deſign, which was to preſerve the Sacred Perſon of the Kings moſt Excellent Majeſty, ſecondly, the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Heir, and thirdly the Kingly Government of this Realm: The ſecond of which includes a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or other Collateral as much as Son; the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief hereby to be prevented being the ſame, and conſequently the Reaſon alike in both Caſes. Thus I have given you only ſome rude hints which at preſent induce me to be for the affirmative in this Queſtion, Praying your thoughts hereupon if you have any thing to offer contrary to what I have ſaid, or in confirmation thereof, if you agree, and to return me the ſame, and you'l Oblige</p>
