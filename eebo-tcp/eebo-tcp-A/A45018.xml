            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And that the Houſe of Commons may underſtand our deſires, not only to preſerve the Peace of this County, which (with Gods bleſsing, and the help of the good known Laws of this Kingdome) we are confident we ſhall maintain, but alſo of the whole Kingdome, being now in ſo great a diſtraction, that every Man ſtands at a gaze, to ſee what the event is likely

to be, and well weighing what a great fire a ſmall ſpark may kindle; abhorring and deteſting the thought of a Civill War: We farther require you to offer our humble advice, as Faithfull and Loyall Subjects to His Majeſty, and good Patriots and Lovers of our Countrey, for ſetling the Diſtractions of theſe times. One principall meanes to effect it, we conceive will be to give His Majeſty full ſatisfaction in His Juſt Deſires, in theſe foure Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1. In preſently leaving the Town of</hi> Hull <hi>in the ſame State it was before Sir</hi> John Hothams <hi>entrance into it; And delivering His Majeſty His own Magazine.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3. That the Parliament be adjourned to an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent place, where His Sacred Majeſty, all the Lords and Members of Your Houſe of Commons may meet and treat with Honour, Freedom, and Safety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4. That His Majeſties Navie may be immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="reasons">
               <head>Our Reaſons are theſe.</head>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> For withdrawing your Garriſon out of the Town of <hi>Hull,</hi> we are perſwaded your fears and Jealouſies of forraign forces, of French, or Danes, or of the Papiſts at home (an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable Party, eſpecially being diſarmed) are long ſince vaniſhed, the Magazine or a great part of it being removed to London, we conceive Maſter Major of <hi>Hull</hi> may ſafely keep the Town as before.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:55348:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>2.</hi> For laying aſide the <hi>Militia,</hi> we are free from Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies of Forraign Forces, ſo that you may have time enough to frame a laſting Law, which notwithſtanding, for feare of Inconvenience to the Subjects Liberty, you may, if you ſo think fit, make the Law a Probationer. Beſides, His Majeſty, if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſhould be, is veſted with ſufficient power to raiſe forces for the Defence of the Kingdom, for which onely we are confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent His Majeſty will employ them. And we ſhould hold our ſelves worſe then Infidels, if, after ſo many Proteſtations to maintain the True Religion by Law eſtabliſhed, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in the Liberty of their Perſons and Propriety of their Goods, and the Priviledges of Parliament, and that He will Govern us by the known Laws of the Land, we ſhould not with full aſſurance, beleeve in Him and confide in Him.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> For adjourning the Parliament to another place, His Majeſty hath expreſſed the Reaſons, That He was driven away by tumultuary Aſſemblies, and that he cannot return thither with Honour and Safety: And divers of the Lords are abſent, who promiſe to return back to the Houſe, when they may ſit with the Liberty, and that condition that the Peerage of <hi>England</hi> formerly have done, ſecured from all menaces, or demanding any Account of their particular Votes; which we conceive to be againſt the Freedom of Parliament, which by our Proteſtation we muſt maintain, and from tumultuarie Aſſemblies: Theſe having been the Occaſions, as we beleeve, that of neer five hundred in the Houſe of Commons, there are but about one hundred and forty left to ſit there, and the greater part of the Lords gone away.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4.</hi> For the Reſtitution of the Navie, our Reaſon is, That the Neighbour Nations do take notice, that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Navie is detained from him, which if not ſuddenly
<pb facs="tcp:55348:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reſtored, may turn to His Majeſties diſhonour, whoſe honour, by our Proteſtation, we are bound to maintain.</p>
               <p>Another means, we conceive, to ſettle the States and Minds of the Subjects, is a free, generall, and large pardon: which ſince His Majeſty hath ſo graciouſly offered we deſire and expect to receive, and if any Man do diſlike it, he may be excepted, and the generality of the Subjects not hindred of their good, and His Majeſties Grace and Goodneſſe.</p>

            <p>That the Petitioners are not more eaſed and ſatisfied with the good Laws His Majeſtie hath paſſed, then His Majeſtie himſelfe is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with that way of obliging His Subjects, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath He ever made the leaſt Promiſe or profeſſion of repairing or redreſſing the grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of His People, which he hath not been, and alwaies wil be ready to perform.</p>
            <p>His Majeſtie cannot blame the Petitioners
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55348:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be apprehenſive of a civill War, ſince the preſent diſtractions (grounded upon no viſible cauſe, to which His Majeſtie could, or can yet applie a remedy) threaten no leſſe confuſion. But His Majeſtie doubts not, that the Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and all His good Subjects, do well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, That His Majeſtie hath left no way unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, which in Honour or Wiſdom could be conſented to, to prevent that confuſion.</p>
            <p>That after ſo many Injuries and Indignities offered to Him, ſo many combinations and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies againſt Him, He departed ſo much from His own Majeſtie, and the Juſtice due to it, That He required no other reparation, then to have His Town, Goods, and Navie (taken and kept by violence from and againſt Him) to be reſtored to Him: The power of making Laws without Him, by the way of Ordinances (and that in particular, concerning the <hi>Militia</hi>) to be diſavowed. And that a ſafe Place might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on, where He might be preſent with His great Councell, for the compoſing all miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, and making the Kingdom happy.</p>
            <p>That before any Anſwer returned to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie (whil'ſt with all patience and hope His Majeſtie forbore any action or attempt of force,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55348:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
according to His promiſe) Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of <hi>Hull</hi> in the Night, burned the Houſes, and murthered the Perſons of his fellow Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects (though He knew His Majeſtie quietly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected an Anſwer to His reaſonable and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary demands) and hath ſince exerciſed moſt barbarous cruelty upon a Drummer then taken Priſoner by him.</p>
            <p>That thoſe Propoſitions made by His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, and mentioned by the Petitioners, in their Inſtructions, are diſſented from, and His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie not ſuffered to enjoy what is as unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably His own, as any thing His Subjects can call moſt theirs, upon pretence there is ſome truſt on foot to diſpoſſeſſe His Majeſtie of them: Whether any ſuch truſt be derived from the Petitioners: Themſelves beſt know.</p>
            <p>That a Generall is made to command His Subjects againſt Him, and Forces already marching with Canon towards Him, under the conduct of the Lord <hi>Brook,</hi> whil'ſt all Labour and Endeavour is uſed, to cut off all Succour and Supply from His Majeſty, as from a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Enemy.</p>

that theſe ſtrange unheard of proceedings muſt be the effects of deſperate Reſolutions, and that all this calamity is brought upon this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to wreſt from His Majeſtie His Juſt Rights, when no ſober man can ſee the want of any thing which is in His Majeſties power to grant, and neceſſary for the peace and full happineſſe of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>That when all encouragement is given, ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals raiſed, and provocations uſed to incenſe the People againſt His Majeſty, and to publiſh Petitions and Declarations againſt the known Laws and eſtabliſhed Government: The Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, and all other His Majeſties good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects (who out of a true ſenſe of the diſtraction and ruine the Commonwealth muſt ſpeedily fall into through theſe diſtempers have prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſober and moderate Petitions and Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions for the peace of the Kingdom) have been diſcountenanced, cenſured and impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a Lawleſſe Arbitrary way, when no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence have been committed by them, of which the Law hath taken notice: That all their Rights, Intereſts, and Priviledges, which they were born to, by the good known Lawes, are

taken from them, or ſubjected to an unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Arbitrary power and reſolution, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes their confidence and aſſurance even in Innocencie it ſelf; They will think it time to provide for their own ſecurity, by Aſſiſting His Majeſtie for the defence of His Perſon, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the true Proteſtant Religion, and maintenance of the Law of the Land, and Liberty of the Subject; of the which, as the Petitioners care is very eminent, and deſerves all protection, thanks, and eſtimation from His Majeſty; So His Majeſty will venture His Life and His Crown with them, in that Quarrell.</p>
