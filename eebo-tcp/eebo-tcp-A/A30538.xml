         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Return to the Ministers of London,
by way of Answer to their Seasonable
Exhortation, (so called) &amp;c.</head>
            <p>1 FOrasmuch as you the <hi>Ministers</hi> in and about <hi>London,</hi>
have sent forth a Seasonable <hi>Exhortation</hi> (as you call
it) to the people of your <hi>Congregations,</hi> which I have
seen, read, and considered, and do find something
therein worthy of Answer; for the end that people may be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
concerning things doubtful, which are in controversie
this day among many; for it is well known the controversie
hath been long, and is grown very high between us and you,
concerning <hi>Church, Ministry,</hi> and <hi>Religion:</hi> And divers things
in your <hi>Exhortation</hi> are doubtful unto many, and that all
doubts may be removed, if possible, therefore I do return what
follows as an answer unto you.</p>
            <p>Whereas you say, you are not ignorant of the prejudices and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
wherewith the carnal world is leavened, concerning your
Calling, Office, and Doctrines, and what clamours, and fiery conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
abound for them every where, that pleads Christs Cause
in the gates, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> As for your <hi>Calling, Office,</hi> and <hi>Doctrine,</hi> there is much
to be said against them, in and by the Spirit of the Lord, for
your <hi>Calling</hi> and <hi>Office,</hi> is not according to the example of
Scriptures, though the Calling and Office of Ministers of the
Gospel hath example in the Scriptures, yet as you are called
into your <hi>Office,</hi> that is not according, but rather contrary to
the Scriptures: And as for your <hi>Doctrine,</hi> it is in some things
unsound also. Now as for Seasonable Exhortations of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
to people, I do acknowledge that is a duty which ought to
be done, but how seasonable and sound your Exhortations are,
that remains to betryed; and it is not only the carnal world,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57906:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as you speak, that are doubtful concerning your Calling and
Office, but it is the best of the people, whose eyes the
Lord is opening, to see and behold the false imitations of the
<hi>Calling</hi> and <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Ministers,</hi> as you have stood for many Generations.
And it is true, them that pleads Christs Cause,
they all cryed out upon, and contended with, but this fully
belong not to you, though you apply it to your selves, but it
pertains more to others, for the <hi>World</hi> speaks well of you, as it
use to do of false Prophets.</p>
            <p>And you say, <hi>We the Ministers of the Gospel in the City of
London, do with earnestness exhort the people of this City, to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
as out of sleep, and to lay to heart, the great dangers that
threatens you, which you represent under a threefold considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 The fear of the return of Popery.</p>
            <p>2 The distracted estate of Religion amongst us.</p>
            <p>3 Other symptomes of Gods wrath hanging over your heads.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That you are Ministers of the Gospel, this is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
unto many, and many more testimonies might be given to
the contrary, than can be given for it. But this is not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
debate, and therefore no more of it.</p>
            <p>And what, is the people of your Congregations yet asleep?
Have not you awakened them in so many years time? Have you
been preaching over them, and taking their money so long, and
are they yet to awaken, as out of sleep? Will not the blame of
this, and the condemnation of it fall upon you their Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who hath not yet awakened them? And may not they
say that you have dealt unjustly by them, who are left as asleep
under all your preaching, and are yet unsensible of the danger
that threatens them? Oh friends! will you consider, and your
people with you, what you have been preaching, and what they
have been hearing for so long a time, seeing you now acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
they are yet asleep, and unawakened.</p>
            <p>Now as to the first of your considerations, <hi>The fear of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of Popery,</hi> for which you lay down divers things to make
the people believe it: <hi>First, The union of forreign Popish Powers:
Secondly, The vast numbers</hi> (say you) <hi>of Popish</hi> Emissaries <hi>and</hi>
Iesuites <hi>that swarms amongst you: Thirdly, The vending and print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of so many Popish Books every year,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:57906:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> As for <hi>Popery,</hi> I know it is <hi>idolatry,</hi> and their <hi>Church</hi>
and <hi>Worship,</hi> and every part thereof abomination to the Lord,
and the spirit that leads them, is not the spirit of Jesus; and
as for <hi>Popery,</hi> it was never yet truly cleanse out of the Nation,
but there hath been, and are great remainders yet standing,
which may indeed easily prove its former strength: For is not
the most part of the <hi>worship</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> made up
of such things, as was first instituted and practised amongst
the <hi>Papists,</hi> witness, the making Ministers by natural learning,
at <hi>Schools</hi> and <hi>Colledges,</hi> and their maintenance by <hi>tythes,</hi> and
yearly <hi>stipends,</hi> and their way of <hi>Parochial</hi> settlements, are not
all these things <hi>Papistical?</hi> and witness sprinkling infants, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it the Baptisme into the <hi>Visible Church,</hi> and witness the
singing of <hi>Davids Psalms,</hi> as now they are sung among you,
these things for the most part are of <hi>Popish</hi> institution, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other things also pertaining to your <hi>Church, Religion,</hi> and
<hi>Ministry,</hi> so that <hi>Popery</hi> was never clean cast out of the Nation,
though the Lord hath wounded it, yet there is the remainder
of it yet standing in great force, so that while <hi>tythes</hi> are
pleaded for by you, and those things practised by you, it may
indeed be feared, the return of <hi>Popery,</hi> seeing you stick so fast
in those practises which were of <hi>Popish</hi> institution, and the
cause of fear lies at your door, and upon your selves princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally,
and if there be vast numbers of <hi>Popish Priests</hi> and <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites</hi>
swarming amongst you, if you be Ministers of Christ, why
do you not discover <hi>Wolves</hi> in Sheeps cloathing, and fright
then away? Why do you not lift up your Spiritual Weapons,
(if you have them) as the <hi>Apostles</hi> did? whose weapons were
powerful and mighty through God, and who shall bear the
blame but you, if <hi>Wolves</hi> in sheeps cloathing tear your <hi>Flocks?</hi>
that is a sign you are lazy idle <hi>Shepherds,</hi> and that you want the
Power and Authority of <hi>God,</hi> and when the powers of the
earth fails you, and your carnal weapons are all broken, then
you are like to be overcome with the swarming of <hi>Popish Priests</hi>
and <hi>Iesuites,</hi> if there be any such among you look you to it,
for I know not any, and if you know any by name, and where
they are, you ought by your Law to discover them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now</hi> (you say) <hi>they are acting under the disguise of</hi> Sectaries,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57906:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>and subtilly insinuating many of their Doctrines, as teaching</hi> Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<hi>by Inherent Righteousness;</hi> perfection, <hi>unlawfulness in
joyning in your</hi> Ordinances, <hi>and nullity of your</hi> Ministry <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Now these that you call <hi>Sectaries,</hi> may truly plead
against you, against your <hi>Church, Worship, Ministry</hi> and <hi>practises,</hi>
upon good grounds; and as for <hi>Iustification</hi> by Inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
it is a Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> that the
Saints witnessed Christ, and his Righteousness within them,
and that none are justified by any righteousness without them,
but who witness Christ revealed in them, for all are reprobates
that do not witness Christ in them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. And as for <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi>
that is the doctrine of the Gospel, and of Christ, for
the <hi>Apostles</hi> spake wisdome to them that were perfect, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 6.
and Christ commanded them to be <hi>perfect, Mat.</hi> 5. who never
commanded impossibilities. You might better have charged
these doctrines upon the <hi>Apostles,</hi> than upon the <hi>Papists;</hi> and
as for joyning to your <hi>Ordinances,</hi> there is many that fears
God, who are not <hi>Papists,</hi> that for good conscience sake cannot
joyn to your <hi>Ordinances,</hi> nor own your <hi>Ministry,</hi> neither in its
<hi>Call, Practise,</hi> nor <hi>Maintenance;</hi> and if these things were in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute,
I should shew you, according to Scripture, that it is not
lawful for the Saints of God, to joyn themselves to your <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,</hi>
nor own your <hi>Ministry;</hi> but it is lawful for them both
to deny your <hi>Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Ministry</hi> in their present stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and as for printing and vending so many <hi>Popish</hi> books
as you say, oh it had been your wisdome to have mentioned,
the books by name, that all might have known which were
<hi>Popish</hi> books; but because your Charge is general, I cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
particularly, either to clear or to condemn, except you
had mentioned in particular, which you ought to have done,
rather then to have slandered in the dark.</p>
            <p>Your fourth reason, whereby you would make your people
believe, <hi>that there is fear of the return of</hi> Popery, <hi>is, That the
whole body almost of</hi> Popery <hi>is published by</hi> Sectaries, <hi>especially</hi>
Quakers; <hi>and you say you cannot but observe a ready co-incidency
with</hi> Papists <hi>in their Opinions, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> As for the <hi>Quakers,</hi> which you have long opposed by
Prisons, Goals, and Persecutions, and your carnal weapons,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57906:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and now also charge great things upon them, to make them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
to the people. Alas, do you not know that they are blessed
of the Lord? Is there never a man among you sixty one Priests,
so wise as <hi>Balaam</hi> was, he saw there was no Inchantment against
<hi>Israel,</hi> nor durst he curse whom God had blessed; but however,
they have borne with patience (and they do therein continue)
all that you have caused to be acted, and all that you have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
against them, and your words and works against them shall
be your own burthen in the day of the Lord, and shall sink
you into misery, who hath made the innocent people the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of your malice and fury, but God is with them, I need
say nothing: and why have you not particularly instanced what
particular part of <hi>Popery</hi> they do publish? Why will you charge
in secret, and prove nothing in particular? therefore I do
charge you to mention, what particular things they do publish
which is <hi>Popery,</hi> and not the truths of the Gospel, and then
you shall have a further answer.</p>
            <p>Your fifth reason is, Jesuitical designs, <hi>and you mention the
Protestant</hi> Universities, <hi>and the impoverishing; and disgracing, and
overthrowing a godly</hi> learned Ministry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> As for the <hi>Vniversities,</hi> thousands are satisfied con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them, that they are of <hi>Popish</hi> institution, and are not
the Fountains of Divinity, as they have been falsly called, for
its possible I could give large testimonies of the wickedness of
the educations which is these in those places, and how little
good they learn, and how much evil; But you have stated the
cause wrong, for the plucking down the <hi>Vniversities</hi> would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
seem to be the removing part of <hi>Popery,</hi> than to be the way
to let in <hi>Popery:</hi> and as for a godly <hi>Ministry,</hi> that is truly <hi>godly;</hi>
and truly <hi>learned,</hi> alas there is no fear of impoverishing, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracing,
and overthrowing of that, for that is alwayes poor
and low, and contemptible to the world, and so it must be;
and it is <hi>Antichrists Ministers</hi> that feares to be made poor, and
that their <hi>tythes</hi> and <hi>stipends</hi> should be made less, and it is
they that fear to be overthrown, and not the <hi>Ministers</hi> of
<hi>Christ,</hi> for the <hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> are out of all such fears, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their standing and falling depends not upon earthly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
but are builded upon the Rock of Ages, and cannot be
overthrown.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:57906:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Your sixth ground is, <hi>Toleration for</hi> Popery <hi>is publikely plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for in print, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That <hi>Popery</hi> is idolatry, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> 2
false Church, that I have said, and I hope shall never renounce
it, but shall alwayes give testimony, until death, against the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> but I must tell you plainly, it is not my
judgement that the <hi>Papists</hi> ought to be burned for their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
or if a <hi>Iesuite</hi> be taken in <hi>England,</hi> I would have him
so tolerated, that he should not have his life taken away by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humano
cruelty, not for <hi>Religions</hi> sake, except something can
be charged upon him, besides, matters of his <hi>Religion,</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:</hi>
This is my judgement, that both the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>you</hi>
are <hi>Antichristian,</hi> (in this) in that <hi>you</hi> kill each <hi>other,</hi> when
they take one of <hi>your Ministers,</hi> and <hi>you</hi> theirs, to destroy each
other: this is not of God, but of the <hi>Dragons power</hi> in both,
and there ought to be more toleration in both, that lives may
be spared; and you ought to conquer with <hi>Spiritual Weapons,</hi>
if that you have them, and not to kill and murther persons,
but to judge <hi>spirits;</hi> That is contrary to Scripture, and the
<hi>Apostles</hi> example, to destroy mens lives for <hi>Religion</hi> sake: And
why may not the <hi>Papists</hi> have toleration, in matters concerning
God, as well as others: So those that plead for their toleration
upon this account, that they may be converted from sin,
and not destroyed in their sin; this is no <hi>error,</hi> that their lives
may be spared, but to plead for their toleration, as the right
<hi>Religion,</hi> this is sin. And thus your sixth ground, wherefore
you fear the return of <hi>Popery,</hi> is answered.</p>
            <p>Now I come to the second consideration, which is, <hi>The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
distracted estate of Religion, which you say is evidenced in divers
particulars: First, your division in civil and spiritual things, so
that the wonted love and communion in holy duties, is interrupted,
strangenesse and distances fomented, censures and hard opinions of
each others entertained, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Here is your error, for true <hi>Religion</hi> is not distracted
nor divided in it self, but it is one in unity and peace, and so
are all they that are in it, their hearts being united by the
Spirit of the Lord, in their Faith Practise, and Worship, and
in all things pertaining to their <hi>Religion:</hi> Its true, there is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57906:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
amongst all the <hi>false Sects</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> upon the
earth, and it must be so, <hi>Babilon</hi> is divided, and confounded
in its self, and one part of it against another, so the distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
is among your selves, among <hi>Papists, Prelates, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
and the rest, tearing and rending one another about
<hi>Church-worship,</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> all like <hi>Wolves</hi> in sheeps cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
biting one another, being divided in <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>spiritual</hi>
things, one crying for <hi>this,</hi> and another for the <hi>other way</hi> of
Government in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> and you are out of the true
love, and true communion in holy duties, and interrupts one
another, and what one saith is <hi>right,</hi> another saith is <hi>wrong;</hi>
and all this is in <hi>Babilon,</hi> among your selves, and none of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them that are in the true <hi>Religion,</hi> and in true <hi>Church-Vnion,</hi>
who are gathered by the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Your second <hi>Evidence</hi> of the distracted estate of <hi>Religion</hi> (as
you say) <hi>is the many horrid and hideous errors, which for some
years past have abounded amongst us, against the Authority of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
the Diety of Christ, the Holy Ghost, Trinity of Persons,
Immortality of Souls, Doctrines of Repentance, Humiliation, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
Resurrection from the Dead, the eternal recompence of
Heaven and Hell, yea, divers Sects encreasing every day in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
power, and malice, and under the names of</hi> Quakers, Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
Seekers, <hi>&amp;c. oppugning the received Doctrine, and unquestion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
interest of Christ Iesus amongst us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That many horrid errors have abounded amongst
<hi>you,</hi> that's very true, as in many particulars might be instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced:
But why do you maliciously charge the <hi>Quakers</hi> with
opposing the interest of Christ Jesus? The Lord shall judge
you in his day, when he makes it appear to all the world, that
those whom you charge with the contrary, are the very friends
of <hi>Christs</hi> interest, and have been patient sufferers for his
Name sake, under the wickedness of your Generation; and
as for the <hi>Ranters, Seekers,</hi> and others, whom you have reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
up together with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> it is well known that we
are in opposition in spirit unto all these, and have given large
testimony in the fear of God against them, though it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that there is many as upright and sincere men towards
God amongst these <hi>Sects</hi> you have mentioned, as any of <hi>your
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57906:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Congregations;</hi> and though in some things they are condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
yet in some things they are as justifiable as <hi>you</hi> are, before
the Lord: And what the <hi>Seekers, Ranters, Familists,</hi> and the
rest mentioned by you do hold, as in these things you have
charged them with, Ile leave that, for I am not now pleading
their cause, but the Cause of God and his People, whom
you in scorn call <hi>Quakers;</hi> and though you have joyned them
in accusation with others, yet I must separate them from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in my Answer, and must tell you in the fear of the Lord,
that you have belied them, and falsly accused them out of
your malicious hearts, for they do not deny the Authority of
the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> but gives that authority to them, which the
Spirit of God that gave them forth have formerly given, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do they deny the <hi>Deity</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> but do say, in him dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the fulness of the <hi>Godhead;</hi> neither do they deny the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit,</hi> nor the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> but say there are
<hi>three,</hi> and these <hi>three</hi> are <hi>one;</hi> but as for your <hi>Trinity</hi> of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
that is language besides the Scriptures; and we do affirm
the Soul is <hi>immortal,</hi> and as for the Doctrines of <hi>Repentance,
Humiliation, Sanctification, Resurrection</hi> from the dead, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
recompence of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> these Doctrines are
publickly held forth by them in words, and also in practise,
more than by your selves; therefore with what face you could
charge them with the denial of these things, it is almost
wonderful; and there are thousands of your Congregations
that are and have been sometimes hearing in your <hi>City,</hi> that
shall bear witness against your accusations, and give evidence
that they have heard them, whom you call <hi>Quakers,</hi> give
faithful witness of, and for all these things which you charge
them with denial of: Do you think that your <hi>Congregations</hi>
are all so blind as to receive for truth what you herein have
spoken, nay, I must tell you, some of them are offended with
you because hereof.</p>
            <p>First, in that you have reckoned the <hi>Quakers</hi> with <hi>Ranters,</hi>
and others, between whom there is absolute opposition, and
not agreement, neither in doctrine nor practise.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That you should charge the <hi>Quak</hi> with such things
as they are altogether clear of, and known to be so by many;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57906:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but this is, that your folly and weakness might appear, and
as you speak of encreasing every day in <hi>number, power,</hi> and
<hi>malice,</hi> some part of this is true, for the Lord doth encrease
his people daily in <hi>number,</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> by his <hi>spirit,</hi> but not
in <hi>malice,</hi> and that is your torment, the encrease of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi>
which as they have begun to encrease, so the Lord will
continue them, and you nor mortal men shall not be able to
hinder, neither the Magistrates persecution, nor the Ministers
instigation thereunto, though you have joyned hand in hand
against them, for the Lord is with his people, and his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and power is their defence, and they are not in empty
formes (as you say) but in the power of Godliness; and as for
your Ordinances and Ministry, of which you speak, something
I have said to it already, and more I shall say hereafter.</p>
            <p>Your third Evidence is, <hi>the odious scandalls of those that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
themselves to be the people of God, as their self seeking, their
unparaellel'd breach of all civil and sacred oaths, whereby the mouth
of iniquity is opened, and the reverence of religion abated, so that
to us (say you) there appeares no visible way of repairing the credit
of strict profession, but by a severe punishment of Professors, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is true, many that do professe themselves the
people of <hi>God,</hi> but are not, but by their lives and practises
gives odious scandalls, and are self-seeking, as you say; but
upon whom the guilt of this may truly be charged, that remains
to be sought out, doubtlesse it lies as neer your doors as any
others, for is not your pride and oppression by taking <hi>tithes,</hi>
and suing people at law for wages, and casting them in prison,
because for good conscience sake they cannot pay you, your
seeking for your gain from your quarter, and your taking great
sums of money, and preaching for hire, taking so much
yearly, are not these odious scandalls, and very self-seeking
practices which you are guilty of, while you pretend publique
good? as for breaches of oaths and covenants, I wish you to
search your own hearts, for that iniquity doth lye as near your
generation as any others, witnesse that you and your brethren
have from time to time engaged to such and such things: as
first, did not you engage for the government to be without
<hi>King,</hi> and <hi>House of Lords?</hi> And did not you then cry up the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57906:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Protector,</hi> contrary to your engagements, and now cry up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother:
and thus it is very evident, that the guilt of breach
of Oaths &amp; Covenants, lies neer unto your selves, which indeed
opens the mouth of iniquity; for the very <hi>Cavaliers</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates</hi>
say, you were once strict in your way, but now you have
struck hands with them, and are now your selves doing that
which you cryed out against in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And <hi>thousands</hi> in this
Nation is abated in their affections from your <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,</hi>
as knowing them to be upon a false <hi>Foundation,</hi> and to be
of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and not of the Heavenly <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> And what
do you mean by severe punishment of professors? do you mean
to set up <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> lawes again, and that all must be forced
to your <hi>Church</hi> way and Religion? is it in your hearts to
drive the Nation by force, and if they will not, to punish them
with fire, and faggot, and prisons? If this be your meaning,
as may justly be supposed it is, the Lord deliver the Nation from
you, this is not the way to gain the credit of <hi>Religion,</hi> but the
further you go on in this way, as you have formerly walked in,
the more will your <hi>Profession</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> stink in the nostrils
of all good men.</p>
            <p>Your fourth Evidence is, <hi>Immensity, &amp; boundless liberty permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
assumed, &amp; freely practised by many, to write,</hi> print <hi>and</hi> publish
<hi>all manner of</hi> blasphemies <hi>and</hi> opinions, <hi>&amp;c. the sad and woful
effects thereof appears in many, some being in Apostacy, others
in luke-warmnesse, and much decay in the power of godlinesse, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> As I have acknowledged there are without doubt
many <hi>errors, blasphemies,</hi> and <hi>false oppinions</hi> extant in this
Nation, both written, published, and maintained, but upon
whom, and what sort of men this can truly be charged, this
is very doubtful to many; and your charge being onely gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
no particular answer can well be given, only it appears,
you would have none to <hi>write, print, and publish,</hi> but your
selves, or by your consent; and you would tye the <hi>Nation</hi> up
in the bondage of your own <hi>spirits;</hi> and you would be the
only Judges of <hi>blasphemies</hi> and <hi>errors;</hi> but that we allow not,
for enemies must not be Judges, and it is very possible that such
is your darknesse, that you may call truth error, and error
truth in some particulars, but if you shall instance any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57906:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Doctrines, Blasphemies, Errors,</hi> and <hi>Opinions,</hi> published
and maintained, in my next I shall freely give my witness
against them, if they be really so, and against the people that
holds them, as well as your selves, &amp; more particularly I cannot
now say; and there is indeed woeful and sad effects of <hi>errors</hi>
brought forth in this <hi>Nation,</hi> and many are in the <hi>Apostacy</hi> from
the truth, and in the <hi>luke-warmness</hi> also, and the power of
<hi>Godliness</hi> is decayed, and they have the <hi>Forme,</hi> and holds that
without the <hi>Power:</hi> your selves may do well, and your <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations</hi>
also, to search your own hearts, by the spirit of the
Lord in this case, that the guilty may see, and turn unto the
Lord, that his wrath come not upon them.</p>
            <p>Your fift Evidence is, <hi>Sabbath Prophanation,</hi> both in <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
and <hi>Practice,</hi> grown to a greater height than ever formerly;
the Iewes <hi>Sabbath</hi> cryed up, instead of the Christian: <hi>Shops</hi>
opened upon the <hi>Lords day,</hi> yea, some working the works of their
<hi>ordinary callings,</hi> in knitting, and sowing of garments in our
Assemblies, even in the Pulpits, in the time of Gods publike
worship, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This remains doutful to many, what the true <hi>Sabbath</hi>
is, and whether the Lord doth require of this <hi>generation</hi> the
observing one day above another, and if so, what day it is
that he requires the observing of; as for the 7th day of the
week, we know that the Lord commanded the <hi>Iewes</hi> to keep
as a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and to rest, But that was never commanded to
the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and as for the first day of the week, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Christians <hi>Sabbath,</hi> that is doubtful to many, whether
God commands and requires the observation of that day by the
gentile believers, yea, or nay; seeing that there is neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
nor binding example for it, through out the Scriptures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
if there be any I do desire that you would shew it in your next,
and by what authority, whether from men, or from Heaven,
the first day of the week is now kept by you, as your <hi>Sabbath;</hi>
for really many are doubtful in this case, and you would do
very well, if you have a command from <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>example</hi> from
his servants in former ages, to discover so much unto the
people; And as for your calling it the <hi>Lords day,</hi> it is certaine
every day is his, and not one day more then another; and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57906:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as for <hi>shops</hi> opening, and such things as you mention, though
every one that do such things, may not be justified in the
doing of it, yet such a thing in it self may be justified, if
the spirit of the Lord moves unto it, and who shall limit the
Lord? And why may not others labour in their ordinary
<hi>callings</hi> that day, as well as you in your ordinary <hi>callings?</hi> I
mean, your ordinary <hi>calling</hi> of <hi>preaching;</hi> that it is an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<hi>calling,</hi> it is certaine, because you deny any extrordinary
<hi>calling</hi> in these dayes, and so I only query this, why others
may not follow their ordinary <hi>callings</hi> as well as you? for it
hath been affirmed very lately by some, that <hi>preaching</hi> was a
trade, and a <hi>function</hi> for men to get a living by, and we
do not question but there are many now in this Nation, called
Ministers, that do <hi>preach</hi> for that end, and would cease to
<hi>preach,</hi> if <hi>money</hi> and <hi>tithes</hi> were ceased to be given them:
I speak this of some, not of all, which doth demonstrate,
that the way of your preaching, is an ordinary <hi>calling;</hi> which
you labour in, on your <hi>Sabbath day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your sixth Evidence, <hi>is the powring out by many of all
sects with a full mouth, all manner of obloquy and contempt
upon</hi> Ministry, <hi>and</hi> Ministers <hi>of the Gospel, openly interrupting
them in the excercise of their duty, whereby they are</hi> discouraged
<hi>in their work, while they are represented under the notion of</hi>
Baals Priests, Gehazaes, pulpited divines, <hi>distributers of</hi> Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies
Doses, Simonions, Decimating Clergy, <hi>common</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiaries,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is certain, that the true Ministry, and Ministers of
the Gospel were in all ages and now are contemned and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised,
and all manner of evill spoken against them for the
name of Christ: But whether you are those true <hi>Ministers</hi> of
the Gospel, and your <hi>Ministry</hi> the true <hi>Ministry</hi> sent of Christ,
this is doubtful to many; and by many particulars which
might be instanced, the contrary doth appear: The <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi>
of Christ in the daies of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> they never complained
of being <hi>interrupted;</hi> for they were haled before <hi>Rulers,</hi> and
commanded to preach no more in that name, and yet they
were not discouraged thereby in their work, nor when they
were called <hi>movers</hi> of sedition, and deceivers, and such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57906:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
names, they regarded not these things, but as for
<hi>you,</hi> you seem to be troubled that any should speak to you, or
ask you a question, or exhort you to repent, if any out of good
conscience query with you, concerning your <hi>practise</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>
and if any exhort to good, and cry against evil amongst
you, this you call interrupting of you, in your <hi>Ministerial</hi> duty,
and to <hi>prison,</hi> houses of <hi>Correction,</hi> and to <hi>Whips</hi> and <hi>Stocks,</hi>
must such go, which was never the <hi>Apostles</hi> practise, never was
any sent to <hi>prison</hi> for opposing of them; and what if the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of <hi>England</hi> be called <hi>Hirelings,</hi> and false Prophets, and
greedy <hi>dumb dogs,</hi> the practise of some of them doth prove it
that they are so; these things you must bear, as coming deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly,
and not unjustly upon you, for the servants of the Lord
in all Ages ever cried against <hi>deceivers,</hi> and false <hi>Prophets,</hi> and
called them <hi>deceivers,</hi> and <hi>greedy dumb dogs,</hi> and <hi>Serpents,</hi> and
<hi>vipers,</hi> and evil beasts, and slow bellies; these names and terms
did <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> use unto such as are some
of the <hi>Ministery</hi> of this <hi>Nation,</hi> and not with revilings and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachings,
but with the Spirit of Authority from God, that
reproves the wickedness of <hi>Prophets, Teachers,</hi> and people; and
tell me, have not some of you sued men at the <hi>Law,</hi> and cast
them into prison in this <hi>City,</hi> because they would not give you
<hi>money,</hi> and <hi>tythes,</hi> and <hi>hire,</hi> though such as have not heard
you, nor received you as <hi>Ministers,</hi> not received any thing
from you, and such as you did never any work for, have you
sought wages from, and caused them to be <hi>imprisoned</hi> that
would not give you? And tell me in good earnest, can any less
be said of such who thus walk, but that they are <hi>insatiable hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi>
and as bad as <hi>Baals Priests,</hi> and even <hi>cheaters,</hi> and <hi>greedy
dumb dogs,</hi> let the Witness in your own <hi>consciences</hi> answer, and
you shall have a reply.</p>
            <p>Now I come to your third <hi>particular,</hi> which is <hi>other causes
and symptomes of Gods wrath hanging over your heads, the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
disappointment from time to time, of all hopes of coming to
any settlement in Government in the Nation, occasioned by strange
confusions, which is a clear evidence that God hath in displeasure
darkened our eyes, and bid counsel from us</hi> (say you.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is very true, that from time to time of late daies
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57906:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Lord hath disappointed the purposes of men, even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
settling of <hi>Government,</hi> and there hath been almost
strange confusions in changes, but to what can this be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?
Have not your fins been as great a cause of it as any others?
And have not you and your Generation been the Councellors
in all these matters? Was not some of you or your Brethren in
<hi>Olivers</hi> daies, and in <hi>Richards</hi> daies, and in the Armies daies,
and in the Parliaments daies, and are not you and your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
busie at this day in ordering a settlement of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in this Nation? But the Lord hath hitherto disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>you</hi> and them, that <hi>you have counselled;</hi> and broken you into
confusion and distraction, and turned backwards even the
proceedings of <hi>Rulers,</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> and the spirit of deep
<hi>sleep</hi> and of <hi>slumber</hi> is powred upon you all, and the <hi>vision</hi> of
these things is as a sealed book unto you, even because of Gods
displeasure against you; and in that you say, <hi>your eyes are dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and counsel is hid from you,</hi> in that you say true, though
to your own shame: And what trust can be put in such
<hi>Watchmen?</hi> What confidence can be placed by your people in
you? when as you acknowledge that your eyes are darkned,
and counsel is hid from you; the Scriptures mentioned by you
doth prove there was darkness upon the Land, but <hi>Isaiah</hi> doth
not say, nor <hi>David,</hi> that counsel was hid from them, or that
their eyes were darkned, neither did ever the <hi>Apostles</hi> say so,
but witnessed that the Lord was their light, and in him their
eyes were opened, and counsel was revealed to them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, You say, <hi>This sadly presages of</hi> unchurching <hi>the
Nation, or the</hi> departing <hi>of the glory of God from you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> By <hi>unchurching</hi> the Nation, I suppose you mean ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the <hi>Church</hi> no <hi>Church,</hi> which if this can be done, then
the Gates of hell may prevail against the <hi>Church,</hi> contrary to
the words of <hi>Christ,</hi> who said, the Gates of Hell should not
prevail; but I must tell you, the Nation of <hi>England,</hi> as to the
general part of it, hath been long, and yet is <hi>unchurched,</hi> that
is, ungathered by the Eternal Spirit, into the true fellowship
in the Body of <hi>Christ;</hi> for the night of <hi>Apostacy</hi> and <hi>Darkness</hi>
hath been over the world, since the <hi>Apostles</hi> daies, and over this
Nation in particular, and your <hi>Churches</hi> hath been no true
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57906:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Churches,</hi> nor the people under your <hi>Ministry</hi> truly joyned
and united in true <hi>Church</hi> Order, and under true <hi>Church</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
though I do not say but that there are thousands of
sincere people that loves the Lord, yet remaining among you,
and the day of the Lord is appearing, which will confound
the <hi>Whore,</hi> the <hi>false Church,</hi> which hath been set up in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and through the world, and Assemblies which hath had
the name of the <hi>Churches</hi> of Christ, will be found to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in the judgement of the Lord, and all the false <hi>Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
Practises, and Ministers, must be thrown down, that the
glory of the Lord may again appear.</p>
            <p>Further you seem, <hi>to charge your selves with leaving your first
love, and former zeal, for the truth and worship of God, but the
present coldness and indifferency in the things of God, together with
your barrenness and unanswerable walking to the Gospel of Christ,
&amp;c.</hi> (say you.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Though to your own shame, yet I do believe this is
truly acknowledged, that you have lost your <hi>first love</hi> and <hi>zeal,</hi>
which once was in you, in the daies when you were persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
under the Bishops, you were full of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>zeal</hi> for the
<hi>truth,</hi> and <hi>worship</hi> of God, according as it was made manifest,
and then you were sufferers your selves, but now you are <hi>cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers</hi>
of others to <hi>suffer,</hi> and there is indeed much <hi>coldness,</hi> and
<hi>dryness,</hi> and <hi>barrenness,</hi> amongst <hi>you</hi> and <hi>your</hi> people; I do tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
desire you may repent you thereof, that if so be the Lord
may heal you; and your walking indeed is <hi>unanswerable</hi> to the
<hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> (to wit) your taking of <hi>tythes,</hi> and so much
<hi>by the year</hi> for preaching; and <hi>suing</hi> people at the Law that will
not give you wages, though you do no work for them; these,
with many other things which you practise, is an <hi>unanswerable</hi>
walking to the <hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and seeing you have confessed
your sius in some measure, repent and sin no more, that your
iniquities may be blotted out.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>you complain of the prevalency of</hi> Atheisme, <hi>and doting
upon</hi> error, <hi>endless separations, common ignorance, unbelief, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness,
the prejudice against wholesome doctrine, and all order
of discipline in the Church, and many other confusions are upon us,</hi>
(say you.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:57906:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Alas! So it is, but where is the blame? Oh you
Watchmen! Should not you have better preserved your flocks?
Should not you have fed them with living food? Should not
you have been examples of righteousness and truth unto
them? And should not you have nourished them with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and understanding? But because the <hi>Shepherds</hi> have
been <hi>lazy</hi> and <hi>idle,</hi> and fed themselves, and not their <hi>flocks;</hi> but
the <hi>Shepherds</hi> have ruled over their flocks with force and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
and their <hi>Ministry</hi> and <hi>Preaching</hi> hath been a very burden
and oppression upon the people, and therefore it is that their
<hi>flocks</hi> are <hi>divided</hi> into many Sects, and separations, and great
confusions is in your Assemblies, and among you, even the sin
of the people in some measure, will be charged upon you their
<hi>Teachers,</hi> whole flocks are run into <hi>errors,</hi> and <hi>Atheisme,</hi> and
despise wholesome doctrine, and are out of true order, and
Church-discipline, even in the traditions of men: Therefore
oh that you <hi>Ministers</hi> would consider! and that you would learn
more wisdome, and that your people would come to receive
the Spirit of the Lord into their hearts, whereby they may be
led into all truth, and into the Covenant of God, where
there is no <hi>unbelief, ignorance, prophanenesse,</hi> no confusion; but
<hi>peace, love,</hi> and <hi>unity</hi> altogether, and if you and they did
come into this, you might be happy, and the judgments of the
Lord would be removed.</p>
            <p>Now I come to some particulars which you do promise for
your selves: First, <hi>That you will use all holy endeavours to keep
God and his Truth among you.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That you will be more
diligent in watching over your</hi> flocks. Thirdly, <hi>That you shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
the establishment of your Congregations against</hi> Popish <hi>delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To all which I answer: You must first make clean your own
hearts, and you must first repent of your own iniquities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you can heal others; and you must first learn obedience to
God in your own hearts, before you can truly instruct others
therein: And indeed there is need enough for you to mourn
before the Lord, and to fast, and to confess your sins, (as you
say) for the Lord has been long <hi>departed</hi> from <hi>you,</hi> and his
presence from your <hi>Assemblies,</hi> and that is the cause of <hi>dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57906:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and drinesse,</hi> and <hi>barrennesse</hi> among the people, because
Gods presence is wanting among you; and you had indeed
need to be more diligent in watching over your flocks, for you
have been negligent therein, and have fed your selves, and not
them, and you have sought <hi>theirs,</hi> and not <hi>them,</hi> its partly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and it is time for you now to amend, and to put away
the evil of your doings; but first, before you dispence the
word to others, you must feel the word in your own hearts, to
be as a <hi>fire</hi> and as a <hi>hammer</hi> in you, and you must know another
<hi>Foundation</hi> for <hi>Ministers</hi> than you have long stood upon, even
the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ</hi> must be your <hi>Foundation,</hi> and you must
cease to <hi>preach</hi> for <hi>hire,</hi> and to <hi>divine</hi> for <hi>money,</hi> and then
should it be better with you, and your flocks would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in you, if you had received freely from the Lord, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
freely to them; but while you do it for ends to your
selves, they can have no good hopes nor confidence in you.</p>
            <p>And whereas you exhort your <hi>Congregations</hi> in divers parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars:
<hi>First, to take heed of false teachers, trying their spirits,
and holding fast that which is good, especially to beware of Popish in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuations,</hi>
(say you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Your Exhortation is good in it self, but you should
have demonstrated more plainly how <hi>false teachers</hi> should be
known, conparing their fruits <hi>now,</hi> with what they were in
the daies of <hi>old,</hi> when the Scriptures were written, and that
had been a good way to have discovered <hi>false teachers;</hi> that six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of <hi>Matthew,</hi> mentioned by you, bids them beware of
the leaven of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and Christ said, <hi>they were such as
was called of men Master,</hi> stood praying in the <hi>Synagogues,</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
uppermost rooms at <hi>feasts,</hi> went in <hi>long robes,</hi> and of such
Christ bids beware, and of such now the people in <hi>London</hi> are
to beware, where ever they are, for such as do these things, are
in the steps of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> which Christ cried
<hi>Woe</hi> against, and the true Prophets cried against such
in their daies as preached for hire, and that sought
for their gain from their quarter, and such you ought
to cry against now, as seek for their gain from their quarter,
except the guilt of these things in your selves stops your
mouths from crying against them in others; and the <hi>Apostles</hi>
cried against such as went for gifts, and rewards, such as taught
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57906:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for <hi>filthy lucre,</hi> and such as made <hi>merchandize</hi> of people for
gain for themselves, such the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
and such you ought to declare against; but the people
of your <hi>Congregations</hi> may say, who are such now? and where
are they? that I leave to their consciences to judge who it is,
and where they are now, and whether there be any of them in
this City now, and in the Nation, that are called of men <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
and love uppermost <hi>rooms</hi> at <hi>feasts,</hi> and that preacheth for
<hi>hire,</hi> and money, for gifts, and rewards, seeks for their <hi>gain</hi>
from their <hi>quarter,</hi> teacheth for <hi>filthy lucre,</hi> and gain; who
are found in these things now, such are <hi>false teachers,</hi> who
ought to be taken heed of: I shall not now say it is any of you,
but I shall leave it to <hi>you,</hi> and to <hi>your peoples</hi> consciences, to
whom your <hi>Exhortation</hi> is; and as I have said before, let all
<hi>Popish inventions</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi> be first cast out of this Nation, and
then if you joyn with us against it, through the Spirit of the
Lord we will endeavour the keeping of it out, and that it shall
no more enter in amongst us into this Nation.</p>
            <p>And you say, <hi>that your knowledge here, and all other graces
here, are imperfect;</hi> to which I say, then you are imperfect
<hi>Saints,</hi> imperfect <hi>Ministers.</hi> But what do you mean by here? I
suppose that you mean upon earth, now there are none of the
<hi>Graces of God that are imperfect,</hi> but the Grace of God is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in it self, <hi>and the Spirit of God is perfect, and every gift of
God is perfect;</hi> as saith the Scriptures. Now that you should
say the <hi>Graces of God are imperfect,</hi> this is <hi>error,</hi> even abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<hi>error,</hi> and you shew <hi>unsoundnesse</hi> in Judgement, even in
the things of God, and hath belied the <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Gifts</hi> of
God, which in their least measure are <hi>perfect.</hi> And thus I
have looked over your <hi>Exhortation,</hi> and thus I have returned
to you again, not but that I know it is the duty of <hi>Christs Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi>
to exhort their flocks, and that exhortation in it self
is good, but when I find where lies and false accusations are
against the <hi>Quakers,</hi> whom I dearly love and own, upon that
account, and not otherwise have I engaged with you, and
what I have done, it is not rendering <hi>evil</hi> for <hi>evil,</hi> but rather
to reprove your evil, and to undeceive your <hi>Congregations,</hi> who
might otherwise take all for true that you have said, if it were
not reproved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:57906:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Again, you exhort your Congregations,</hi> that they manifest
sincerity, not only by hatred of error, but by a love of the truth,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Sincerity of heart is indeed precious, especially where
the Spirit of the Lord is the rule of Judgement, and doth
mannage that sincerity; but where a false spirit rules in the
judgement, the sincerity is often betrayed into a zeal against
the truth, and against the wayes of the Lord, rather than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise;
and thus it was with the <hi>Iewes,</hi> whose sincerity
(through their error of judgement) was turned into <hi>zeal</hi> and
<hi>bitternesse</hi> against <hi>Christ:</hi> And thus it is to be feared it is with
many in your <hi>Congregations,</hi> who may have a <hi>zeal</hi> without
<hi>knowledge,</hi> and be short of true discerning between what is
<hi>truth,</hi> and what is <hi>error,</hi> I speak not this of all, but of some,
for its no small thing to discern between <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>error,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in this day, wherein there are so many wayes and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of <hi>Church-Ministry,</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi> and yet all professing the
<hi>Scriptures</hi> are their Rule of <hi>Faith, worship,</hi> and <hi>practise;</hi> and
seeing that all <hi>Sects</hi> do professe proof from Scripture for what
they hold forth, what ground have the people to believe you
more than others, or others more than you? for where people
receives <hi>Doctrine</hi> or <hi>Religion</hi> by report from others, without
the <hi>evidence</hi> of the Spirit of God in their own hearts, this is
not receiving of the truth unto eternal life; wherefore I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
your <hi>Congregations,</hi> that every one amongst them may
wait upon the Lord, to have a feeling and discerning in their
own hearts, and that each one may be led and taught of the
Spirit of God which leads into all truth, that they may deny
all false <hi>Ministers,</hi> and false <hi>worships,</hi> and may worship God in
Spirit and Truth, through the ministration of his own <hi>Spirit</hi>
in their <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>consciences,</hi> and thereby will they discern
between <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>error,</hi> and will love the one, and hate the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, You exhort,</hi> That they keep themselves unspotted
from the prevailing corruptions of these back-sliding times, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Concerning the times, many are ignorant; but this
is certain at the present time wherein we are, is the Lord dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting
of men, and its the latter daies of <hi>Antichrists Reign</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:57906:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and <hi>Government,</hi> that hath been in full <hi>power</hi> and <hi>authority</hi>
for many generations, and <hi>Babylon</hi> that great City, her ruine
is threatned, because of her abominations, that have been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and great, for the whole earth hath been corrupted (as
its written) and now the Call of the Lord is, that every man
come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and deliver himself, that he may not
partake of their plagues; and happy are they that are made
clean and unspotted from her sins, that they may not be found
covered with her <hi>garments,</hi> for the day of the Lord is come,
and coming upon <hi>Babilon,</hi> and all <hi>back-sliders</hi> from God and
his wayes. Now <hi>Babilon</hi> is that great City, which hath ruled
over the Kings of the earth, and in her hath the blood of
<hi>Souls,</hi> and of all <hi>just men</hi> been found.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, You exhort</hi> to endeavour a healing of those sad brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and divisions which have been amongst you, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Now <hi>the sad breaches and divisions</hi> which is indeed at
present in this Nation, cannot be healed, but as the cause and
ground thereof be removed, which is the sins of <hi>Rulers, Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi>
and <hi>People;</hi> and this is the cause wherefore the Lord
hath brought distraction amongst them: Oh what ambition
and self-seeking hath been among the Rulers! What judging
for gifts and rewards? what neglect of Mercy and Judgement
amongst them? And oh how have they oppressed the poor,
and trodden down the needy! and because hereof is the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
God vexed? And oh what covetousness and greediness
of gaine are the teachers guilty of! How do they preach for
hire, and divine for money? How have they unreasonably
caused men to be imprisoned, and their goods to be <hi>spoiled</hi>
for <hi>wages,</hi> and <hi>tythes,</hi> and <hi>hire?</hi> Oh how hath <hi>covetousnesse,</hi> and
<hi>idolatry,</hi> and <hi>superstition</hi> abounded amongst the <hi>Teachers</hi> in this
<hi>Nation?</hi> Oh abominable hath been their sins, their oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and self-seekings! and because of these things hath the
Lord brought distractions amongst <hi>people,</hi> and the sins of <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi>
and <hi>People</hi> cries for vengeance from the Lord, and till these
iniquities be removed by repentance and forsaken the fruit
and effect thereof shall never cease, but breach upon breach
will the Lord make, till the <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Priests</hi> repent them of
their <hi>iniquities,</hi> Gods hand will be upon them both in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57906:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and for their sakes <hi>that divine for money, and preach for
hire, and judge for rewards:</hi> Will the Lord make the Nation
as heaps, and as a ploughed field? Therefore let all people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of their iniquities, and return to the light of <hi>Christ</hi> in
their own consciences, and become followers of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> and
this is the perfect way of healing of all breaches <hi>inwardly</hi> and
<hi>outwardly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly, You exhort</hi> to be diligent in the spiritual and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious
performances of family duties, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Men must first be awakened and enlivened unto God,
before they can act for God in holy duties; and as for du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
performed in pretence unto God traditionally, and
without the teachings of the the Spirit of God, is but idolatry,
and the <hi>Nation</hi> is weary of such a <hi>Religion</hi> which they have
received, and held traditionally, for thereby the Soul <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal</hi>
cannot be nourished unto eternal life, and while you
teach <hi>duties</hi> towards <hi>God,</hi> by that rule, while you teach <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
singing, repeating,</hi> catechising, by tradition and imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
without the leadings of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Christ in them, you
do but teach <hi>idolatry;</hi> as long hath been taught in the <hi>Christian</hi>
Nations, the doing and performing such and such things, as
<hi>Christian duties</hi> and <hi>practises,</hi> and the forcing and compell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of doing such things upon people in the <hi>unregenerate
state,</hi> and <hi>unconverted</hi> nature, this <hi>Religion</hi> and such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances
of duties, have been of <hi>Babilon,</hi> and of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi>
and a cheat upon peoples <hi>Souls,</hi> whereby many have
been <hi>murdered</hi> and slain in that great City, and the form of
<hi>Godlinesse</hi> without the Power hath been practised, while du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
have been performed unto God, without the teachings
of the Spirit of God, and such their consciences are blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the Lord abhors their <hi>Sacrifices;</hi> and people must
first come to feel the Word of God in their hearts to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate</hi>
them, before they can perform any acceptable
thing to <hi>God;</hi> and therefore do not teach people to be hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
do not teach them such and such performances, in
the corrupt nature, without the teachings of the Spirit of
God in their own <hi>particulars,</hi> for if you do, you make
them but two fold more the <hi>children of the devil,</hi> and such du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57906:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
performed in that nature, shall not cover nor hide from
the Wrath of the Lord which is comming upon all <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly, You exhort</hi> that they would cause their children and
servants to submit to <hi>Catechisings,</hi> and train them up in there
verence of <hi>godly Ministry,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It may be enquired into, what you mean by <hi>cause
them to submit;</hi> how <hi>cause them?</hi> by force and imposition
upon their consciences, by outward external personal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
or threats? Is this your meaning? Will you set up
<hi>Religion</hi> by <hi>violence?</hi> And must <hi>children</hi> and <hi>servants</hi> be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
by <hi>resraint</hi> and <hi>force?</hi> This is not the right way to
promote <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>Worship</hi> of God, nor to make <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
and <hi>servants</hi> truly religious; it was the <hi>Beast that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
power from the Dragon,</hi> that <hi>caused</hi> all to <hi>worship, both
small and great, children and servants;</hi> and this causing to
<hi>worship</hi> was in the time of the <hi>Apostacy,</hi> when the true Church
was fled into the <hi>Wildernesse,</hi> and all the time ever since, hath
<hi>Nations</hi> been <hi>caused</hi> and <hi>compelled</hi> to such and such perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
and practises of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi> and such
<hi>causing,</hi> I am jealous, your meaning is, whereby you would
<hi>force</hi> and <hi>compell</hi> such manner of <hi>worship</hi> and <hi>practises</hi> upon
people: And what do you mean by <hi>godly Ministry?</hi> Will you
admit of just tryal according to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> whether
yours be that <hi>godly Ministry</hi> or no? for all sorts of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Papists,</hi> and <hi>Protestants,</hi> and all <hi>others,</hi> they will say
that they are in the <hi>right way,</hi> and their <hi>Ministry is the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ministry,</hi> but the fruits of many proves the contrary,
and we cannot believe that yours is the <hi>godly Ministry,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
you will prove it to us, by, and according to the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it is certain, that the <hi>Ministry of the Apostles</hi> was the
true <hi>godly Ministry,</hi> and if yours agree with theirs, then we
will confesse that yours is the true <hi>godly Ministry.</hi> Therefore
tel us plainly, Do you agree with them in your Call, and
in your Maintenance, and in your Practises, and in your
Fruits and Effects, in your Lives and Conversations, and
in your Doctrines? Are you justly according to? and do
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57906:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you agree with the Apostles in all these things? Shall we
lay you to the line, that you may be judged? This is but as
a hint at things whereby you might justly be tryed, for if you
agree not with the Apostles in these case mentioned, then it
is evident that your <hi>Ministry</hi> is not the true <hi>godly Ministry;</hi>
but hereafter we may have a better occasion to try you: And
thus the principal parts of your Exhortation is answered, and
if you can, receive it in love.</p>
            <p>TO all you <hi>sixty one Teachers in</hi> London, <hi>under whose
hands your Exhortation passeth:</hi> This I say to you, in
the fear of the Lord God: Oh ye men consider! and
let it enter into your hearts, the day of the Lord is
at hand upon you, and account of your <hi>Stewardship</hi> must
you give, and his reward must you have whom you have ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and you must reap the fruit of what you have sown:
Oh look upon your flocks, and see what a condition they
are in! Oh what pride and vain-glory is abounding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them! Oh how doth wickedness spring forth from
them! Are they like unto sheep of Christs Fold? Or are
not they appearing outwardly Christians, when as the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
nature is uncut down in them? Oh what wickednesse
abounds in this City! What double-dealing and dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
What lying, and swearing, and drunkennesse? Oh
high are all the fruits of the flesh grown amongst your
<hi>Flocks!</hi> Your <hi>Vineyards</hi> are not <hi>dressed</hi> as they ought to be,
there is abundance of corrupt trees, and fruitlesse bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
which cumbers the ground: Oh it makes the heart
of the righteous sad to walk in the streets, and to view
the <hi>abominations</hi> that are daily brought forth, by a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
professing <hi>Scriptures, Church, Ministry,</hi> and <hi>Christ:</hi> Oh!
it burdens the just, and grieves the righteous soul to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57906:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
how high iniquity is grown among the sheep of your
Pastures, whom ye should have fed with knowledge, and
converted unto the fear of the Lord, had you been <hi>mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers</hi>
sent of God; the very <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> they
blaspheme against <hi>Christ,</hi> through the abominations brought
forth among <hi>Christians,</hi> that have the name to <hi>live,</hi> but
are <hi>dead:</hi> Oh let it enter into your hearts, and smite you,
that your many years <hi>Ministry</hi> should have so little effect,
for your <hi>vineyard</hi> is like untilled ground, unploughed, and
unbroken up: Oh there is much hard-heartednesse amongst
your people, and their hearts goes after covetousnesse, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
while they professe God with their lips; Oh the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
mourns in secret to see the prophanenesse, the scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and reproaches that are brought forth in your <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi>
And oh the <hi>idolatry</hi> that abounds! let it repent you,
that you have been so slothful, and never more seek the
<hi>fleece,</hi> but seek the <hi>flock</hi> thats gone astray from the Lord,
who is the true <hi>Shepherd,</hi> whose voice hath not been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed,
<hi>and many Pastors have destroyed the Vineyard, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Shepherds have fed themselves, and not the Flock:</hi> Oh
consider the day of the Lord is at hand, and he will visit
with his rod: <hi>You</hi> and your <hi>Flocks</hi> prepare to meet the
Lord, for his Kingdome is nigh to come, which will
be a terrible day to all workers of iniquity.</p>
            <p>And as for this your <hi>Exhortation,</hi> I say, as for <hi>Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
in it self, <hi>Ministers</hi> ought to exhort their <hi>Flocks;</hi>
so such a thing in it self I do commend, and not oppose;
but when I had read and seriously considered the aim and
intent of your spirits in your <hi>Exhortation,</hi> I found it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly,
and in a measure openly opposing, and striking
at, and secretly smiting the people of the Lord, whom
you have reproached by the name of <hi>Quakers,</hi> who are
dear to the Lord, and he careth for them, though you
see no beauty in them, but accounteth them altogether
vile, and in as much as you lifted up your hands against
them, upon that account was it upon my spirit to return
something in answer, for the <hi>information</hi> of many, that
they might be undeceived, and not in envy towards any,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57906:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but in love to all, to both you and your people, and you
have occasioned this upon your selves, though you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved;
and not as a man of strife or contention have
I proceeded, but as one that desires the further <hi>manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station</hi>
of truth, and that no false accusastion may rest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, which you have secretly brought forth, with which
the Lord is not well pleased, that you should set your selves
in opposition against his people; and if any of you shall
receive a just reproof and repent, it may prove to you an
advantage of much good, and be not so proud as to say
in your hearts, <hi>What art thou, weak man, that reproves
us? or wherefore art thou so bold thus to deal with us?</hi> but
rather fall under just reproof, for in uprightnesse of
heart have I proceeded towards you, and not in mine
own, but in the will of the Father: And oh that your
<hi>Flocks</hi> would also consider, among whom there are many
that are <hi>zealous</hi> in their way! Oh that their <hi>Zeal</hi> and
<hi>Iudgements</hi> were guided by the Spirit of the Lord, then
should it be well with them! Oh that they would be
<hi>meek</hi> and <hi>humble,</hi> and learn the fear of the Lord! Oh
that every one of them would consider, and turn from
their iniquities, and become followers of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
then should the glory of the Lord be revealed unto them,
and peace, and truth, and righteousnesse should be unto
them, and their Families, and their City, if they would
come into Covenant with God, and he taught of him,
and be exercised by his Law in their hearts, then should
the countenance of the Lord be upon them, and then
should they discern between truth and error, between the
<hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Deceivers.</hi> Oh! there is a pity for
many poor people, which are <hi>zealous</hi> in their way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
without knowledge, and they think they do God
good service, while yet their consciences are not exercised
by the Spirit of the Lord, but a false spirit that rules and
leads, and many holds the truth in unrighteousnesse, and
they know not but they do well: Oh that such would
consider, and not be hasty in any thing to performe or
professe Religion in their degenerate estate, but that they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57906:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
would come to know the Regeneration, and the renewing
of their minds by the Holy Spirit, and that the Immortal
Birth might be born in them, even the Birth of the Spirit
which is Heir of God: Oh that that might live and rule in
them, then should they be Heirs of God; and <hi>Citizens</hi> of the
<hi>New Ierusalem!</hi> And oh ye <hi>people</hi> of <hi>London</hi>! lay it to heart,
<hi>you must be born again,</hi> or else you can never enter into Gods
Kingdome, <hi>you must be changed in nature,</hi> and must be crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to this world, that you may live unto God; this must you
come unto, or else you have no part nor portion in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life; all your <hi>duties</hi> and <hi>performances</hi> in your <hi>forms</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
they cannot save you, nor justifie you, all your <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
praying, singing,</hi> and all your <hi>duties</hi> whatsoever, they are
all nothing, till you come to know <hi>changing and renewing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,</hi>
and do witness the Seed of God raised up in you,
and the head of the Serpent bruised in you by the Seed of the
<hi>Woman,</hi> this must you come to witnesse, that your souls may
live: Oh that you would consider! be not so <hi>zealous</hi> against
that which you may call <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Schism,</hi> for while you erre
in judgement, you may soon speak evil of <hi>truth,</hi> and persecute
it under the name of <hi>error;</hi> many have wofully fallen into that
snare, and brought sorrow upon themselves thereby: The wise
<hi>Iewes,</hi> even the <hi>chief Priests, Scribes,</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> they were
confident in their way, as you can be, and yet they <hi>erred</hi> in
<hi>judgement,</hi> and would not receive Christ, but persecuted him,
under the very name of a <hi>Deceiver;</hi> and thus it is possible for
many to do in this age: What though you have <hi>Christs</hi> words,
and the <hi>Apostles</hi> words; yet if you have not the Spirit of <hi>Christ,</hi>
that was in the Apostles, you know nothing rightly of the
Scriptures, neither can you understand them, nor have Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
by them, for you must know Christ in you, your hope
of glory, else you are reprobates, and shut out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God: And search the Scriptures, and see, if they do
not witnesse this: Do not they say, <hi>Christ is in you, except you be
Reprobates?</hi> and do not they say, <hi>The Law of God is written in
the heart, and the Spirit of God is put in the inward part?</hi> And do
not they say, <hi>That Christ hath lightened every man that comes into
the world with the true light?</hi> And do not they say that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57906:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
exhorts people to hearken <hi>to the Word of God in their hearts,
and to be followers of the Spirit of God that was in their hearts?</hi>
And do not the Scriptures say, <hi>That it was the light that shined
in the heart, that gave the knowledge of God unto the Saints?</hi> Search
the Scriptures, and see whether these things be so; and must not
men be <hi>born again of the immortal seed?</hi> Oh consider and let not
these doctrines seem <hi>new</hi> unto you, neither reject them, though
they come unto you in weak appearance, <hi>not with words of mens
wisdome, but in simplicity, and in sincerity, and in the Power of God:</hi>
And search the Scriptures whether these things be so; were not
they false Prophets <hi>that preached for hire, and divined for money,
and sought for their gain from their quarter?</hi> Were not such decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
in the true Prophets time, and them that preached for fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
lucre, and for money, and for gifts and rewards? were not
such false Brethren, and false Apostles? Search the Scriptures,
whether these things be so, for the day of tryal is now come,
wherein all must be searched, and that <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi>
and <hi>Ministry,</hi> which is not according to the Scriptures, which
was given forth by the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> let that <hi>Religion, Worship,
Church,</hi> and <hi>Ministry</hi> be utterly condemned of the Lord, and all
his <hi>people;</hi> and let such <hi>Ministers</hi> as cannot prove their <hi>call,</hi> their
<hi>maintenance,</hi> and <hi>practises,</hi> to be according to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> let
such <hi>Ministers</hi> be confounded, and silenced for ever, and come
to try this matter when you will. For whereas you cry out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us, as if we were deniers of <hi>Scriptures,</hi> as if we were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>godly Ministry,</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and as if we were
<hi>Deceivers, Hereticks, Papists, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I say unto you, these things have you never yet justly
proved against us, but rather accused us behind our backs, to
make us odious among people; and though for divers years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
we have been <hi>publike,</hi> yet when did ever any of you <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi>
seek by lawful means to convert us, or shew us our errors,
if we were as you say of us, oh it had been your time to have
sought our conversion! and not to have persecuted, to have sent
to prisons, houses of correction, and by such weapons of an
outward force and cruelty have you dealt with us, and not in
meeknesse, and by the Spirit of the Lord, as <hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>
ought to do; but hath cried to the <hi>Magistrates</hi> to defend you and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57906:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
your <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>worship,</hi> being unable, as it were, by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Gods Spirit to defend your selves: Therefore I say
unto you now, lay down your <hi>carnal weapons,</hi> and come out in
in the <hi>spirit of meeknesse,</hi> and come out in the Authority of Gods
Spirit, if you have it, convince us thereby, if we be in an evil
way, as you say, let us hear your soundest arguments by the
Spirit of God, and according to the Scriptures, to prove those
things which you say of us; prove it by evident arguments,
that we deny Scriptures, and that we are <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and that we
are <hi>Papists.</hi> I challenge you all in the Name of the Lord, even all
your <hi>Ministers of London,</hi> let us hear your sound reasons openly
in the <hi>spirit of meeknesse,</hi> and do not <hi>back-bite</hi> nor <hi>slander</hi> in the
dark, neither let us be bawled against by your rude members,
as often we have been, even in the spirit of wickednesse; but
come out <hi>you Ministers,</hi> we are willing to be tryed according to
the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and by the <hi>Spirit of God in our Religion, and in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
part of it;</hi> and if you be the same, then come forth in <hi>the
spirit of meeknesse, like Ministers of Christ,</hi> and lay down your
carnal weapons, and let us have fair dealing openly, that <hi>truth</hi>
may be manifested publikely, and <hi>errour</hi> may be discovered;
and let us not envy one anothers persons, &amp; seek to destroy one
anothers lives, but let us seek to destroy the evil in one another,
that men might be saved, and this would be a <hi>Christian-like</hi>
way, we would hear what you have to charge against our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
by sound arguments in meeknesse, that we may answer, it,
and then we will charge something upon your <hi>Ministry, Church,
Religion,</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi> and we will prove what we say against
you, according to the Scriptures; and we will not impose our
<hi>Religion</hi> upon you, by the force of <hi>outward Powers,</hi> and <hi>outward
Lawes;</hi> neither would we have you force <hi>your Religion, Ministry,</hi>
and <hi>Church</hi> upon us, by such means, but we will leave the effect
of all things to the Spirit of God; and come out when you
will in such a way as this, and this would satisfie thousands,
and let meeknesse and the fear of God be amongst you, and this
is the way to exalt <hi>Religion;</hi> and we would think it a happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
more then otherwise, to be joyned in sober debate and
dispute against you, that you and we, in <hi>your Religion, Church,</hi>
and <hi>Ministry,</hi> and in <hi>ours also,</hi> might be <hi>tryed</hi> according to the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57906:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that all may be satisfied who are doubtful, and may
hear <hi>your principles,</hi> and <hi>our principles discussed,</hi> in the presence
of the people, who may judge by the light and witnesse in
their own consciences, for to that in all we do appeal; and
in such a proceeding, come forth when you will; lay down
<hi>your carnal weapons,</hi> and take the <hi>weapons of the Spirit,</hi> and
come to the tryal, <hi>for the day of the Lord is approaching upon all
the world.</hi>
