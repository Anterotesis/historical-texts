            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>inferiour Prieſts</hi> had only four Garments, which they uſed in their miniſtration. 1. <hi>A linnen Breeches. 2. A linnen Coat. 3. A linnen Girdle. 4. A linnen Bonnet, Exod.</hi> 28.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly they differed in their <hi>marriage.</hi> The <hi>High-prieſt</hi> might not marry a <hi>Widow,</hi> nor a <hi>divorced Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> nor an <hi>Harlot,</hi> but a <hi>Virgin, Levit.</hi> 21. 14.

                  <p>The <hi>High prieſt,</hi> and the <hi>Inferiour Prieſts</hi> agreed in their <hi>conſecration</hi> in theſe particulars.

                  <p>In the time of their <hi>Conſecration,</hi> certain pieces of the ſacrifice were put into the <hi>Prieſts</hi> hand, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 9.

                  <p>In the diſcharge of their offices, the <hi>High-prieſt</hi> differed from the other <hi>Prieſts:</hi> Firſt, becauſe he only, and that but once a year, entred into the <hi>Holy of Holies, Exod.</hi> 16. 34.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>High-prieſt</hi> might not mourn for the death of his neereſt kin, <hi>Levit.</hi> 21. 10, 11. The phraſes uſed there to expreſs mourning are two.

other <hi>Prieſts</hi> agreed in theſe Particulars: Firſt, they both burnt incenſe and offered ſacrifices, 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. 49. Secondly, they both ſounded the Trumpets; the uſe whereof was two-fold; ſometimes to ſound an alarm in the war, ſometimes to aſſemble the people and their Rulers, <hi>Numb.</hi> 10. Thirdly, they both ſlew the ſacrifices, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 22. Fourthly, they both inſtructed the people, <hi>Malac.</hi> 2. 7. Fifthly, they both judged of leproſie, <hi>Levit.</hi> 13. 2.</p>

                  <p>The Office of the <hi>Levites</hi> was, to pitch, to take down, to bear up and down the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and the Veſſels thereof. <hi>Levi</hi> had three Sons, <hi>Gerſhon, Cohath,</hi> and <hi>Merari:</hi> and accordingly the whole Company of the <hi>Levites</hi> were diſtinguiſht into three orders, <hi>Gerſhonites, Cohathites,</hi> and <hi>Merarites.</hi> The <hi>Gerſhonites</hi> charge was to carry the coverings, and hangings of the <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle.</hi> The chief things within the Sanctuary were committed to the <hi>Cohathites.</hi> The wood-work, and the reſt of the inſtruments were committed to the charge of the <hi>Merarites, Num.</hi> 3.

                  <p>THere are divers names given unto the Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Law; and although the Particular year or time when each name began, be not clearly evidenced by Monuments of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> yet in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral we may conceive three diſtinct periods of time; in which the names altered. Firſt, from <hi>Adam</hi> until <hi>Moſes;</hi> Secondly, from <hi>Moſes,</hi> till the peoples return from <hi>Babylon.</hi> Thirdly, from their <hi>return,</hi> until the dayes of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and after. In the firſt period, as <hi>Adam</hi> was <hi>Prophet</hi> and <hi>Prieſt</hi> in his family, ſo after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward every <hi>firſt-born</hi> ſupplyed theſe two offices, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their <hi>princely</hi> office in their ſeveral families. That they ruled their families as <hi>Kings,</hi> and inſtructed them as <hi>Prophets,</hi> is clear to any acquainted with Scripture; the greateſt doubt is, what ſufficient proof there is for their <hi>Prieſtood. Adams Prieſthood</hi> is gathered hence, <note n="a" place="margin">Bertram Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit. Jud. c. 1. p. 17.</note> becauſe that <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 3. and 4. <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi> are ſaid to have brought their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices: to have brought them, namely, unto <hi>Adam,</hi> who offered them unto God in their name. The <hi>Prieſt hood</hi> of the <hi>firſt-born</hi> is gatherable hence, becauſe the <hi>Leviles</hi> were appointed to the ſervice of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, inſtead of the firſt born, and as their <gap reason="foreign">

Secondly, for the whole Word of <hi>God:</hi> no Propheſie in the Scripture is of any private motion, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20. Thirdly, thoſe unto whom God vouchſafed familiarly to reveal himſelf, they are called <hi>Prophets: Abraham</hi> was a <hi>Prophet, Gen.</hi> 20. 7. and <hi>Miriam</hi> a <hi>Propheteſs, Exod.</hi> 15. 20. Fourthly, ordinary Interpreters of the Word are called <hi>Prophets.</hi> He that receiveth a <hi>Prophet</hi> in the name of <hi>Prophet. Mat.</hi> 10. 41. Laſtly, it is taken for thoſe, who were enabled by Divine Revelation, to lay open hidden ſecrets, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending all poſſibility of humane ſearch. Hence it is that <hi>Prophets</hi> in old time were called <hi>Seers, 1 Sam.</hi> 9. 9.

                  <p>There are three obſervable names applied to <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi> in <hi>Scripture. 1. Verbum Domini: 2. Viſio: 3. Onus.

                  <p>Concerning the <hi>Herodians,</hi> thoſe that number them among <hi>Hereticks,</hi> make the hereſie to conſiſt in two things: Firſt, in that they took <hi>Herod</hi> the Great for the promiſed <hi>Meſſias;</hi> becauſe in his Reign; he being a ſtranger, the <hi>Scepter</hi> was departed from <hi>Judah,</hi> which was the promiſed time of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Secondly, they honoured him with ſuperſtitious ſolemnities annually performed upon his Birth-day. Of <hi>Herod</hi> his Birth-day the <hi>Poet</hi> ſpeaketh,

Now whether this latter may be referred to <hi>Herod</hi> the Great, I much doubt; becauſe I find not any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor among the Ancients to ſpeak of <hi>Herod</hi> the Great his Birth-day: It was another <hi>Herod, Tetrarch of Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Antipas,</hi> whoſe Birth-day we read celebrated, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 21.

                  <p>To omit many other conjectures utterly improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I incline to Saint <hi>Hierom,</hi> whoſe Opinion is, <note n="l" place="margin">Hieron.

                  <head>The Cities of Refuge.</head>
                  <p>THeſe places of <hi>Refuge,</hi> appointed by God, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from thoſe of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and <hi>Romulus,</hi> and other <hi>Heathens;</hi> becauſe God allowed ſafety only to thoſe, who were guiltleſs in reſpect of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention: but the others were common Sanctuaries, as well for the guilty as the guiltleſs. If any man did fortuitouſly or by chance kill another man, in ſuch a caſe liberty was granted unto the Offender to fly; at firſt, unto the <hi>Altar</hi> for refuge, as is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by that text of Scripture, <hi>If any man come pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly unto his Neighbour, to ſlay him with guile, thou ſhalt take him from mine Altar, Exod.</hi> 21. 14. Yea, we may conjecture this cuſtome of refuge to have continued in force always, by the practice of <hi>Joab, 1 King.</hi> 2. 28. Notwithſtanding, leſt the Altar might be too far diſtant from the place where the fact might be committed, it is probable that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God ordained certain <hi>Aſyla,</hi> or <hi>Cities of Refuge,</hi> which for the ſame reaſon are thought to have been <note n="a" place="margin">Rab. Salom-Iarchi. Deut. 19. 3.</note> equally diſtant one from the other in <hi>Canaan:</hi> The Cities were in number ſix; <hi>Bezer</hi> of the <hi>Reube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> Country, <hi>Ramoth</hi> in <hi>Gilead,</hi> of the <hi>Gadites,</hi> and <hi>Golan</hi> in <hi>Baſhan,</hi> of the <hi>Manaſſites:</hi> theſe three <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeparated beyond <hi>Jordan, Deut.</hi> 4. 41, 43. The other three, appointed by <hi>Joſhua</hi> in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> were <hi>Cadeſh</hi> in <hi>Galilee</hi> in Mount <hi>Naphthali; Schechem</hi> in <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and <hi>Kiratharba</hi> (which is <hi>Hebron)</hi> in the Mountain of <hi>Judah, Joſh.</hi> 20. 7. There other Cities
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:108702:44"/>
of like nature; <hi>God</hi> promiſed the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their obedience, after their Coaſts were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged; but it ſeemeth that diſobedience hindred the accompliſhment thereof, for Scripture menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth not the fulfilling of it.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Cities, the <hi>Hebrews</hi> note from theſe words, <hi>Thou ſhalt prepare the way,</hi> Deut. 19. 3. That the <hi>Senate,</hi> or <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were bound to prepare the ways to the <hi>Cities of Refuge,</hi> and <note n="b" place="margin">Maimon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Rotſach. cap. 8. ſect. 5.</note> to make them fit, and broad, and to remove out of them all ſtumbling-blocks and obſtacles: and they ſuffered not any Hill or Dale to be in the way, nor water-ſtreams, but they made a Bridge over it, that nothing might hinder him that fled thither. And the breadth of the way to the <hi>Cities of Refuge,</hi> was not leſs than two and thirty Cubits, and at the partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ways, they ſet up in writing, <hi>Refuge, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge:</hi> that the man-ſlayer might know and turn thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therward. On the fifteenth of the moneth <hi>Adar,</hi> or <hi>February,</hi> every year the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> ſent out meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to prepare the ways.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore it was provided, that two or three wiſe men ſhould be imployed, to perſwade the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger of blood,</hi> if haply he did purſue the man-ſlayer on the way, that he ſhould offer no violence, until the Cauſe were heard and examined. The manner of examination was thus; The Conſiſtory or Bench of <hi>Juſtices,</hi> who lived in that quarter where the murder was committed, <note n="c" place="margin">Paul. Fag. Num. 35. 6.</note> placed; the party being brought back from the <hi>City of Refuge,</hi> in the Court, or Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Hall, and diligently enquired and examined the cauſe, who if he were found guilty of voluntary murder, then was he puniſhed with death, but if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the Fact were found caſual, then did they
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:108702:44"/>
ſafely conduct the party back again to the <hi>City of Refuge,</hi> where he enjoyed his liberty, not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the walls of the City, but within certain Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories and bounds of the City, being confined to ſuch and ſuch limits, until the death of the <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> that was in thoſe days, at what time it was lawful for the offender to return and come into his own City, and unto his own houſe, even unto the City from whence he fled, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 20. 6. By this means the offender, though he was not puniſhed with death, yet he lived for the time a kind of exile, for his own humiliation, and for the abatement of his Wrath, who was the <hi>Avenger of Blood.</hi> 
                     <note n="d" place="margin">Maſius in Joſ. cap. 20.</note> The <hi>Areopagitae</hi> had a proceeding againſt caſual mans laughter, not much unlike, puniſhing the offender <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>In caſe any did eat unleavened bread thoſe ſeven daies, the penalty was, that ſuch a <hi>ſoul</hi> ſhould be <hi>cut off from Iſrael, Exod.</hi> 12. 15.

                  </p>
                  <p>Three things may be here demanded. Firſt, who killed the <hi>Paſchal Lamb?</hi> Secondly, where it was killed? Thirdly, where it was eaten? Firſt, it was killed by the <hi>Prieſt, 2 Chron.</hi> 35. 6. Secondly, it was killed after the firſt time in the <hi>Court of the Temple,</hi> the place which <hi>God</hi> had choſen, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 6. <note n="y" place="margin">Maimon in Korban Pefach. c. 1.

                  </p>
                  <p>It may further be demanded, whether the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over conſiſted of two Suppers, one immediately ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the other? Some affirm it, and their reaſons are theſe: Firſt, ſay they, the <hi>Paſſeover</hi> was eaten <hi>ſtanding,</hi> but <hi>Chriſt</hi> uſed another geſture. This argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all other is the weakeſt, for <hi>Chriſt</hi> uſed the geſture of lying on his body, as well in the eating of the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> as at the conſecration of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> generally after the firſt inſtitution, in all their <hi>Paſſeovers,</hi> uſed rather this poſture of their body, than the other of ſtanding, in token of reſt and ſecurity, as appeareth in the <hi>Chapter of the Feaſts.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they ſay, the <hi>Paſchal Lamb</hi> was wont to be roſted; but in the laſt <hi>Paſſeover</hi> which our <hi>Saviour</hi> ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated, there was <hi>Jus cui intingebatur panis, Broth
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:108702:61"/>
into which he dipped the bread.</hi> This reaſon is as weak as the former, becauſe though there was a command to eat the <hi>Paſchal Lamb roſted;</hi> yet there was no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition to joyn their ordinary ſupper with the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, and that might admit broth: But, as it is ſhewn above, the matter into which the ſop was dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, was thought to be the ſauce <hi>Charoſeth.</hi> Thirdly, they urge <hi>John</hi> 13. 2. That the firſt ſupper was done, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> aroſe and waſhed his Diſciples feet, and after that he gave <hi>Judas</hi> the ſop, which muſt argue a ſecond ſitting down. This foretelling his <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> that one of them ſhould betray him, is likewiſe by Saint <hi>Luke</hi> recited after the conſecration of the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> This is the ſtrongeſt argument, and yet not of ſufficient validity, becauſe by a kind of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſis,</hi> or anticipation of time, it is not unuſual, in the Scripture, to relate that firſt, which according to the truth of the Hiſtory, ſhould be laſt. Thus <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. mention is made of <hi>Mary</hi> which anointed the <hi>Lord,</hi> yet her anointing of him followeth in the next <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> And this ſame hiſtory of betraying <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> and Saint <hi>Mark</hi> recited before the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> whence the <hi>Jews</hi> have a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <note n="z" place="margin">

                     <hi>Non eſſe prius aut poſterius in ſcriptura;</hi> That <hi>firſt,</hi> and <hi>laſt,</hi> muſt not be ſtrictly urged in Scripture. Together with theſe anſwers, confider how impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable it is, that ten perſons (for ſometimes they were ſo few) ſhould eat a ſecond ſupper, after they had eaten <hi>A Lamb of the firſt year,</hi> which might be a year old. It is evident alſo by that of <hi>Barabbas,</hi> that it was a received cuſtom on the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> to let looſe and enlarge one Priſoner or other. Concerning the reaſon hereof, the conjecture is three-fold. Some think this cuſtome to have been uſed in memory of <hi>Jonathan</hi> the Son of <hi>Saul,</hi> when the people reſcued
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:108702:61"/>
the reaſon hereof was, that the Feaſt might be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated with the greater joy and gladneſs. Others more probably think, it was done in remembrance of their deliverance from the <hi>Egyptian bondage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, here is to be obſerved, that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> did ſometimes ſpeak accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their <hi>civil computation,</hi> wherein they meaſured their days from <hi>Sun-riſing</hi> to <hi>Sun-riſing:</hi> Sometimes according to their <hi>ſacred computation,</hi> which was from <hi>Sun-ſet</hi> to <hi>Sun-ſet.</hi> This ſerveth for the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation of that, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. 18. which ſeemeth to make the fourteenth day of the month, the firſt day of unleavened bread. <note n="a" place="margin">Joſeph.

                        </gap>.</note> And <hi>Joſephus</hi> telleth us that they numbred <hi>eight days</hi> for that Feaſt.

Mat.</hi> 26. 17. as if the <hi>firſt day of unleavened bread,</hi> were before the <hi>Paſſeover.</hi> All theſe are true according to the computation of their <hi>civil days,</hi> though accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the computation of their <hi>Holy-days,</hi> the <hi>Feaſt of unleavened bread</hi> began the fifteenth day, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſeven days only, and the <hi>Paſſeover</hi> was before the <hi>feaſt of unleavened broad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the laſt place, we muſt know, that there was permited a <hi>ſecond Paſſeover</hi> to thoſe who could not be partakers of the <hi>firſt,</hi> by reaſon either of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs by a dead body, or of their far diſtance from the place where it was to be offered.

                  <head>Of the Feaſt of Trumpets, and their New Moons.</head>
                  <p>FOr the underſtanding of the time when this Feaſt was to be obſerved, we muſt note, the month <hi>Tiſri</hi> was the <hi>ſeventh month,</hi> according to their <hi>ſacred computation;</hi> and therefore it is commanded to be celebrated the firſt day of the <hi>ſeventh month, Levit.</hi> 23. 24. But according to their <hi>civil Computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> it was their <hi>firſt month,</hi> ſo that this Feaſt may be termed their <hi>New-years-day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt day of every month had its ſolemnities. Firſt, when they repaired to the <hi>Prophets</hi> for the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word, as on other <hi>Sabbaths.</hi> Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? It is neither <hi>New Moon,</hi> nor <hi>Sabbath day, 2 Kings</hi> 4. 23. Secondly, it was then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to buy and ſell: When will the <hi>New Moon</hi> be gone, that we may ſell corn? <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 4. Thirdly They had then ſpecial ſacrifices over and above their daily ſacrifices.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding, this Feaſt of <hi>Trumpets</hi> differed from other <hi>New Moons.</hi> Firſt, in reſpect of their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; in their <hi>ordinary New Moons</hi> they offered (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the daily ſacrifice) <hi>two Bullocks, one Ram, ſeven Lambs, for burnt offerings;</hi> with their meat and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings, and a <hi>Goat for a ſin offering, Num.</hi> 28. 11, 15. But at this <hi>New Moon,</hi> which was the beginning of their year, they offered all the foreſaid ſacrifices, and over and beſides them, <hi>one Bullock, one Ram, and ſeven Lambs, for burnt-offerings,</hi> and a <hi>Goat for a ſin-offering,

                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſon in general of this blowing, and great <hi>noiſe of Trumpets,</hi> I take to have been, to make their <hi>New-years day</hi> the more remarkable, becauſe from it all their Deeds and Contracts bore date, and their <hi>Sabbatical years and Jubilees</hi> were counted thence; But why it ſhould be made remarkable by the ſound of <hi>Trumpets,</hi> or <hi>Cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>For certain reaſons the <hi>Jews</hi> uſed a kind of change, or <hi>tranſlation</hi> of days; which <hi>tranſlation,</hi> thought it were of uſe in other months alſo, yet the greateſt oare was had in tranſlating the beginning of their year, or their firſt day in their month <hi>Tiſri;</hi> and he that ſhall diligently calculate theſe changes, ſhall find, that all other tranſlations depended on this firſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tranſlation of days</hi> was <note n="f" place="margin">Scalig. de e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend. temp. l. 2. p. 85.</note> threefold. <hi>Firſt, Luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Secondly, Politick: Thirdly, Mixt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſon of <hi>Lunary Tranſlation,</hi> was, that they might not obſerve the Feaſt of the <hi>New Moon,</hi> until the old were quite over-paſt. For the underſtanding of this Note, theſe three rules.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The <hi>Hebrews</hi> counted their Holy-days from night to night, beginning at ſix of the Clock, ſo that from ſix of the clock the firſt night, till the next noon were juſt eighteen hours.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Always before the <hi>New Moon,</hi> there is a <hi>conjunction</hi> between the <hi>Sun</hi> and the <hi>Moon,</hi> during this <hi>conjunction</hi> ſhe is called <hi>Luna ſilens,</hi> by reaſon of her darkneſs, and all this time there is a participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Old Moon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When the conjunction was over paſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noon tide, namely, in any of thoſe firſt 18 hours, then the <hi>New Moon</hi> was celebrated the ſame day. But if it continued but one minute after twelve of <note place="margin">Munſter. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lend. Heb. p. 46.</note> the clock at noon, then the feaſt was <hi>tranſlated</hi> to the day following, becauſe otherwiſe they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin their Holy-day in the time of the old Moon.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:108702:67"/>
And this tranſlation they noted with this abbreviati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, 18. becauſe of thoſe eighteen hours which occaſioned it.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon of <hi>Politick Tranſlation,</hi> was, that two <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> or feaſt-days might not immediately follow each other: <note n="h" place="margin">Manſt. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lend. p. 139.</note> becauſe, ſay they, it was unlawful thoſe two days to dreſs meat, or bury the dead; and it was likewiſe inconvenient to keep meat dreſſed, or the dead unburied two days. Yet here two excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons muſt be remembred, when the meeting of two Sabbaths could not be avoided.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, when the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> or the fifteenth day of <hi>Niſan,</hi> fell on <hi>Saturday;</hi> for then the <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> muſt needs fall on <hi>Sunday.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, when the <hi>Paſſeover</hi> fell on <hi>Sunday;</hi> for then their <hi>Paſſeover</hi> immediately followed their <hi>week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sabbath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt <note n="i" place="margin">Hoſpinian. de Orig. feſt. p. 6.</note> Author of this <hi>Politick Tranſlation</hi> was a certain chief man amongſt them, named <hi>Eleazer;</hi> three hundred and fifty years before <hi>Chriſt His Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſons why this Feaſt was inſtituted, are thought to be: Firſt, to teach the people to depend upon <hi>Gods</hi> providence by faith; for though the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the field might gather, even on that year, for the maintenance of himſelf and his Family, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. 6. Yet he was neither to ſow his field, thereby to make his harveſt the greater; nor to hedge his field, or lock up his Corn-yard, thereby to enjoy the propriety: but to let all be common, and every mans hand equal in every place. Secondly, they were hereby put in mind of that happy eſtate which <hi>Adam</hi> enjoyed in his innocency, when the Earth brought forth her increaſe without manuring. Laſtly, it ſhaddowed forth that <hi>everlaſting Sabbath</hi> which we expect in the Heavens. <note n="d" place="margin">Vid.

                  <p>The rule is not generally true; for in former times <hi>Adultery was puniſh'd with ſtoning.</hi> I will judge thee after the manner of them that are <hi>Harlots,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Lord, Ezek.</hi> 16. 38.

                  <p>Before we treat in particular of theſe four puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it may be queſtioned, <hi>Whether the Jews had any power to judge of life and death, at that time when they crucified our bleſſed Saviour?</hi> The <hi>Jews ſaid to</hi> Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, <hi>It is not lawful for us to put any man to death,</hi> Joh. 18. 31.

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:108702:105"/>
them at that time from <hi>Pilate, Take ye him, and judge him according to your Law,</hi> John 18. 31. Neither can it be ſaid, that their Law could not condemn him, if he had been a trangreſſor thereof; or that they had not out of their law to object againſt him: for they ſay, <hi>They had a law, and by their law he ought to die,</hi> John 19. 7. It was not then want of <hi>Power,</hi> but the <hi>holineſs of that time</hi> made them ſay <hi>it was unlawful.</hi> For they held it <hi>unlawful</hi> upon their <hi>days of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> to ſit on life and death, as hath been ſhewn in the <hi>Chapter of tranſlating Feaſts.</hi> And <hi>Friday</hi> on which our <hi>Saviour</hi> was condemned, was the <hi>preparation of their Sabbath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> in the queſtion, whether power of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing capital crimes were taken from them by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans?</hi> We are to diſtinguiſh between <hi>crimes.

When <hi>Paul</hi> was brought by the <hi>Jews</hi> before <hi>Gallio, Gallio</hi> ſaid unto them, if it were a matter of <hi>wrong</hi> or <hi>wicked lewdneſs,</hi> O ye. <hi>Jews,</hi> reaſon would, that I ſhould bear with you: but if it be a <hi>queſtion of words,</hi> and <hi>names of your law,</hi> look ye to it, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 14.</p>

Under the name of <hi>firſt-fruits,</hi> commonly Authors treat of no other but this laſt, and wholly omit all the former ſorts. Before we proceed to the explaining of the laſt, note with me the difference of theſe two words, <hi>Thenuphoth,</hi> and <hi>Therumoth:</hi> both ſignifie <hi>ſhake-offerings, heave-offerings,</hi> or <hi>wave-offerings,</hi> but with this difference; <note n="d" place="margin">P.

The <hi>Thenuphoth</hi> was by a waving of <hi>agitation,</hi> waving it to and fro, from the right hand to the left, from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> to the <hi>Weſt,</hi> from the <hi>North</hi> to the <hi>South:</hi> by which kind of <hi>agitation,</hi> they acknowledged <hi>God</hi> to be <hi>Lord</hi> of the whole world.

in the <hi>Biccurim,</hi> or in the <hi>Theruma;</hi> but, by <hi>tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> they were taught to pay at leaſt the <hi>ſixtieth</hi> part in both, even in thoſe <hi>ſeven things,</hi> alſo paid under the name of <hi>Biccurim,</hi> or <hi>firſt-fruits,</hi> as well as in their <hi>heave-offering</hi> termed <hi>Theruma,</hi> or <hi>Theruma gedola.</hi>

                  <p>Thus the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> do diſtinguiſh the <hi>Biccurim</hi> from the <hi>Theruma gedola:</hi> but in my opinion the <hi>Bic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curim</hi> may be contained under <hi>Theruma gedola;</hi> and in truth, both of them are nothing elſe but the <hi>heave-offering of the floor,</hi> formerly mentioned out of <hi>Num.</hi> 15. 20. My reaſons are theſe. 1. <hi>Scripture</hi> giveth no ſuch leave to keep any part of their <hi>firſt fruits</hi> at home; if that could be proved, the diſtinction were warrantable. 2. <hi>Scripture</hi> doth not limit <hi>firſt fruits</hi> unto thoſe <hi>ſeven kinds,</hi> which alone go under the name of <hi>Biccurim.</hi> 3. Themſelves confound both members; for in their <hi>Biccurim,</hi> they ſay, they paid, 1 <hi>Wheat. 2. Barley:</hi> In their <hi>Theruma,</hi> they ſay, they paid <hi>Corn;</hi> as if under <hi>Corn, Wheat</hi> and <hi>Barley</hi> were not contained. Some may ſay, they paid their <hi>Biccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim in the Ear,</hi> while the harveſt was yet ſtanding, and their <hi>Theruma in Wheat and Barley ready threſhed and winnowed.</hi> My reaſons why it cannot be ſo, are theſe: 1. Becauſe then they ſhould pay <hi>twice a ſixti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth part</hi> in their corn. 2. Becauſe the corn offered in the ſheaf was but a little quantity, and it was offered not at their. <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> when their harveſt ended, but at their <hi>Paſſeover</hi> when their harveſt began, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 10. Whereas their <hi>Biccurim,</hi> or <hi>firſt fruits,</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways offered at their <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But omitting further proofs, I proceed to ſhew the ground, why in this <hi>heave offering of the floor,</hi> at leaſt a <hi>ſixtieth part</hi> was preſcribed: it is grounded upon that of the Prophet <hi>Ezek.</hi> This is the oblation

                  <p>This difference ſeemeth to me warrantable, and ſerveth to reconcile many places, of Scripture, as where <hi>God</hi> ſaith, <hi>Offer peace to all,</hi> and <hi>make</hi> a <hi>covenant with none.
