         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Prophecies Concerning the Return of
Popery into England, Scotland
and Ireland.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>JAmes Vsher</hi> late Lord Arch-Bishop of <hi>Armagh</hi> Primate
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> being asked by a Gentleman of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
what his thoughts were of a very great Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which should fall upon the Church of God in these
Narions of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> of which he
had spoken with great confidence many years before,
when we were in the highest and fullest state of outward
peace and Settlement. The Gentleman asked him whether
he did believe those sad times to be past, or that they were
yet to come, to which he answered, that they were yet
to come, and that he did as confidently expect it, as ever
he had done, adding, that this said Persecution would
fall upon all the Protestants Churches of Europe. The
other replyed, that he did hope it might have been past
as to these Nations of our, since he thought, that though
we, who are the People thereof, have been punished
much less than our sins have deserved, and that our late
Wars had made far less Devastations, than War common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
brings upon those Countries where it pleaseth God in
Judgment to suffer it: yet we must needs accknowledge
that many great Houses had been Burnt, Ruined and left
without Inhabitants, many great Families Impoverished
and undone, and many thousand Lives also had been lost
in that bloody War, and that <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> as
well as <hi>England,</hi> had drunk very deep of the Cup of God's
Anger, even to the overthrow of the Government, and the
utter desolation almost of a very great part of those
Countries.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:99359:3"/>
But this holy man turning to him, and fixing his eye
upon Him, with that Serious and Irefull Look, which he
usually had when he spake God's Words and not his own,
and when the power of God seemed to be upon, and to
constrain him to speak, which the Gentleman could
easily discern much to differ from the Countenance,
wherewith he usually spake to him, He said thus.</p>
            <p>Fool not your self with such hopes, for I tell you, all
you have yet seen, hath been but the beginning of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
to what is yet to come upon the Protestant Churches
of Christ, who will er'e long fall under a sharper Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than ever it hath been upon them, and therefore
said he, Look you be not found in the outward Court,
but a worshiper in the Temple before the Altar, for Christ
will measure all those that profess his name, and call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
his People; and the outward worshipers he will
leave out, to be trodden down by the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The
outward Court (says he) is the formal Christian whose
Religion lies in performing the outside without shewing
any inward life and duties of Christianitie, Power of faith
and love, uniting them to Christ, and these God will
leave to be trodden own, and Swept away by the <hi>Gentiles;</hi>
but the worshipers within the Temple and before the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
are those who do indeed worship God in Spirit and
in Truth, whose souls are made his Temples, and he is
honoured and adored in the most Inward thoughts of
their Hearts, and they Sacrifice their lusts and vile
affections, yea, and their own wills to him, and these
God will hide in the hollow of his hand, and under
the shadow of his Wings; and this shall be one great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between this last, and all the other proceeding Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions;
for in the former, the most Eminent and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Ministers and Christians did generally suffer most,
and were most violently fallen upon, but in this last Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,
these shall be preserved by God as a seed to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of that glory which shall Immediately follow and come
upon the Church, as soon as ever this storm shall be over.
For as it shall be the Sharpest, so it shall be the shortest
Persecution of them all; and shall onely take away the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99359:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
grosse Hypocrites and formal Professors, but the true Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Believers shall be Preserved till the Calamity be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman then asked him by what means or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
this great Trial should be brought on. He answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by the Papists; the other replyed, that it seemed to him
very Improbable they should be able to do it, since they
were now little Countenanced, and but few in these Nations,
and that the Hearts of People were more Set against them
than ever since the Reformation. He answered again,
That it would be by the hand, of Papists, and in the way
of sudden Massacre, and that he the then Pope would be
the chief Instrument of it. He then added, that the
Papists were in his own opinion the <hi>Gentiles</hi> spoken of in
the 11th of the <hi>Revelation</hi> to whom the outward Court
shall be left, that they might Tread it under Foot: They
having received the <hi>Gentiles</hi> worship in their Adoring
Images, and Saints departed, and in taking to themselves
many Mediators; and this (said he) the Papists are now
designing among themselves, and therefore be sure you be
ready.</p>

                  <hi>BAbylon</hi> must down, and yet the Kings lament her fall,
Who then must Pull her Down but the People?
Not that the People can raise a War meerly for Religion,
but God will so order things, That the Papists Shall by
their Malice be put upon such Plots and Entreprizes, that
shall make Themselves Liable to the Justice of the Law, so
that King's shall have no Legal Power to resure them from
it, but inferiour Magistrates assisted by the People shall
in a Just way fall upon them, even then when the Kings
of the Earth, and their Merchants shall lament them.
Hence <hi>Revelation 19.</hi> 6. The <hi>Hallelujah</hi> that is begun
upon the Lord God Omnipotent Reigning, is begun by
the People. <hi>I hear the voice of many Waters,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Saying,
Allelujah, for the Lord God Omnipotent Reigneth.</hi> Now
the Scripture frequently sets forth the People by Waters,
as <hi>Revelation 17. 15. The Waters which Thou sawest were
People.</hi> We read <hi>Canticles 5.</hi> 11. Where the Glory of
Christ is set forth, it begins at the Head, but <hi>Cant 7.</hi> 1.
Where the Glory of the Church is set forth, it begins at
the Feet; <hi>How beautifull are thy Feet!</hi> Surely the Right
Knowledge of these Liberties God hath given his People,
will much help forward the Great things God hath to do
in this Latter Age.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>MIrum quidem,</hi> &amp;c. It is a wounderfull thing that
<hi>Azuarrus</hi> 400 years ago should say that indeed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the year 1500 the Catholick Religion should fall
much in lustre, extent and authority <hi>(If I translate his
words aright)</hi> onely I must confess the pride, vanity, and
security of the Catholick Clergy seem to make way to it:
yet (which is more strange) the same Religion shall cover
it's self towards the years 1700, onely I must needs say
that I think the late divisions arising no doubt from Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Insinuations, seem to threaten the Late Reformation;
weakening the Interest of Religion on the one hand, and
opening advantages to the adversaries of it on the other;
while the Jewish way was one and entire within it self,
it was secure from forreign attempts upon its <hi>being</hi> or <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi>
as soon as it was crumbled into those minute parts
and factions of <hi>Esseans, Pharisees, Sadducess, Herodians,
Zelots,</hi> &amp;c. It yielded to the adversary, and at last was
resolved to nothing: But that I think there is a providence
in all ages remarkable, which doth at once bear testimony
to, and secure Religion, I shall much fear that our most
excellent Religion, so miserably confounded by its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
followers, would one day give place to the two
grand mischiefs of the world <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Profaneness;</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
which there are no other remedies below the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

               <p>WHen the motion was first made, for the publishing of
these Papers, it seemed to me to be as the <hi>casting of
water into the Sea;</hi> so great is the Number of the Learned
Writings of Protestant Divines against the Papists (which
will never be well answered) that the most elaborate addition
may seem superfluous; much more these hasty Disputations
prepared but for an exercise which is the Recreation of a few
Country-Ministers at a monethly meeting, when they ease
themselves of their ordinary work. But upon further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
I saw it was, <hi>The casting of water upon a
threatning fire,</hi> which the Sea it self doth but restrain. It's
more Engines than a few that are openly or secretly at work
at this time to captivate these Nations again to the <hi>Roman</hi>
Pope. When so many hundreds, if not thousands are night
and day contriving our seduction, (under the name of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
us to the Church;) if no body counter-work them what
may they not do. Its not enough that we have had Defenders,
and that their Books are yet in the World. Old Writings are
laid by, though much stronger than any new ones: But new
ones are sooner taken up and read? The Papists have of late
been very plentiful, and yet very sparing in their Writings
Plentiful of such as run among the simple injudicious people
in secret, so that the Countries swarm with them; But spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of such as may provoke any Learned man to a Confutation:
That so, they may in time dis-used us from those Studies, and
so disable the Ministry therein, and catch us when we are
secure through a seeming peace, and fall upon us when we have
lost our strength. And I am much afraid that the generality
of our people (perhaps of the best) are already so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used
from these studies, as to be much unacquainted with
the Nature of Popery, and much more to seek for a preservative
against it, and a through confutation of them. So that if
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99359:6"/>
Papists were once but as fully set out among us in their own
likeness, as they are under the names of Quakers and other
Sects, what work would you see in many places? I doubt many
would follow their pernicious ways, and fall like Sheep of a
common rot, or People in a raging pestilence, especially if
they had but the countenance of the times: Not through <hi>their</hi>
strength, but because our people are naked, and unmeet for a
defence.</p>
               <p>The work that now they are upon, is, 1. By Divisions, and
reviling the Ministers, to loosen the people from their Guides; that
they may be as a Masterless dog that will follow anybody that will
whistle to him.</p>
               <p>2. To take down the Ministers maintenance and encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agements,
that they may be disabled so vigorously to resist
them.</p>
               <p>3. To hinder their union, that they may abate their strength,
and find them work against each other.</p>
               <p>4 To procure a Liberty of seducing all they can under the
name of Liberties of Conscience, that so they may have as fair
a game for it as we: and ignorance and the common corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of nature (especially so heightened by a custome in sin)
doth befriend the Devil's cause much more than God's; or else
hows comes it to pass that the Godly are so few, and
Error, Idolatry and Impiety doth so abound in all the
Earth!</p>
               <p>5. To break the common people into as many Sects and Parties
as they can, that they may not onely employ them against one
another, but also may hence fetch matter of reproach against
our profession in the eyes of the World.</p>
               <p>6. To plead under the name of Seekers against the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of all Religion; that men may be brought to think
that they must be either of the Popish profession or of
none.</p>
               <p>And indeed when all Sects have done their worst it is but
two, that we are in any great danger of (And of those I think
we are in more danger, than the most are aware of) and that
is, 1. <hi>Papists:</hi> who plead not as other parties, onely by the
tongue, but by exciting Princes and States against us, and
disputing with the Fagot or Hatchet in their hands: And if
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99359:6"/>
we have not Arguments that will confute a Navy, an
Army, or a Powder-Plot, we can do no good against
them.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Prophaneness,</hi> animated by Apostate Infidels: This is
the Religion that men are born in. And men that naturally
are so indeared to their lusts, that they <hi>would not</hi> have the
Scripture to be true, will easily hearken to him that tells them it is
false.</p>
               <p>Yea so much doth Popery befriend men in a vicious course,
that some are apt to joyn those together, thinking at the heart
that Christianity is but a Fable: but yet for fear it should prove
true, they will be Papists, that they may have that easie remedy
for a reserve.</p>
               <p>If God will preserve us but from these two dangers, Popery
and Prophaneness animated by infidelity, it will go well with
<hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Either Scripture is true or not true: If not, Popery is
not true, which pleadeth its warant from it (and some of them
argue, as if they purposed to disprove the Scripture and to
imitate <hi>Sampson,</hi> in pulling down the house on their heads
and ours, in revenge for the dishonour they have suffered by
the Scripture.) If it be true (as nothing more true) then Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
is not true, which palpably contradicteth it, as in the
points of Latine service, and denying the Cup in the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and many other is most evident.</p>
               <p>3. Either the judgment of the Antient Doctors is sound or
not: If not, then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is unsound, that is
sworn to expound the Scripture only according to their consent:
If it be sound, then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is unsound, that
arrogate a Vniversal Government and Infallibility, and build
upon a foundation, that was never allowed by the Antient
Doctors (as in the third Disp. I have fully proved) and
which most Christians in the World do still reject.</p>
               <p>4. Either Reason it self is to be renounced or not: If it be,
then none can be Papists but mad men. If not, then Popery
must be renounced, which foundeth our very faith upon impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssibilities,
and teacheth men of necessity to believe in the Pope
as the Vicar of Christ, before they believe in Christ, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the like, which are afterwards laid open.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:99359:7"/>
5. Either our five Senses, and the judgment made upon
them, is certain and infallible or not. If not, then the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> both Pope and Council are fallible, and
not at all to be trusted: For when all their Tradition is by
hearing or reading, they are uncertain whether ever they
heard or read any such thing; and we must all be uncertain
whether they speak or write it: And then we must not only
subscribe to <hi>Fransc. Sanches. Quod nihil scitur,</hi> but also
say that <hi>Nihil certo creditur.</hi> But if sense be certain and
Infallible; then the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> even Pope and Council
are not only Fallible; but certainly false deceivers and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
For the Pope and his Council tell the Church that
it is not Bread and Wine which they take, eat and drink in
the Eucharist. But the senses of all sound men do tell them
that it is. I see that its Bread and Wine, I <hi>smell</hi> it, I
<hi>feel</hi> it, I <hi>taste</hi> it; and some what I <hi>hear,</hi> to further my as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance:
And yet if Popery be not false, its no such matter.
One would think the dullest Reader, might be quickly here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
whether Popery be true or false. Look on the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
Bread and Wine, touch it, smell it, taste it, and if
thou canst but be sure that it is indeed Bread and Wine, thou
mayest be as sure that Popery is a delusion. And if thou can'st
but be sure, that it is not Bread and Wine, yet thou mayst be
sure that the Pope or his Council, nor any of his Doctors are
not to be believed. For if other mens senses be deceitful, theirs
and thine are so too.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reader,</hi> Adhere to God, and the Righteousness of Christ,
and the Teachings of the Holy Ghost, by the Scriptures,
and a faithfully Ministry, in the Communion of the
Saints, and as a member of the Catholick Church, which
arising at Jerusalem, is dispersed over the World, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
all that are Christians; renounce not right Reason,
or thy senses; and live according to the light which is
vouchsafed thee; and then thou shalt be safe from Popery,
and all other pernicious damning Errors.</p>

O, saith our Saviour Christ, the good shepherd
and bishop of our souls, my harvest is beaten down
and lost, and there is none that will go abroad and
save it. My people run headlong to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
not of Malice but of very simplicity, only
because they are not taught, because they know not
my father nor me. Also, it is not my fathers will that
any of them should be lost.</p>
               <p>But for the hope of posterity, I report me to all
you which are fathers, and have children for whom
you are careful. Although your selves have a zeal
and care for the house of God: yet will you breed
them up, keep them at School, until four and twenty
years old to your charges, that in the end they may
live in glorious poverty? that they may live poorly
and naked like the Prophets and Apostles? Our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
shall rue, that ever such fathers went before
them: And Chronicles shall report this contempt
of learning among the punishments, and murrains,
and other plagues of God. They shall leave it writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in what time and under whose raign this was
done. Or if we grow so barbarous that we consider
not this, or be not able to draw it into Chronicle,
yet fortain Nations will not spare to write this,
and publish it to our everlasting reproach and
shame.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, what may be ghessed of their

Howsoever in other things they do well, howsoever
they seem to rejoyce at the prosperity of <hi>Sion,</hi> and to
seek the safety and preservation of the Lords Anointed:
yet needs must it be, that by these means forraign
power, of which this Realm by the mercy of God is
happily delivered, shall again be brought in upon us.
Such things shall be done unto us, as we be for suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered:

if the tempest be so dark in the sea, that the load-star
lose her light, and the needle tail to give token of the
North Pole, no marvel though the ship lose her
course, and be swallowed in the sands.</p>
               <p>The Gospel, of Christ is the fountain of light, and
of knowledge. It cannot be maintained by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and darkness. These be the props of their
kingdom which take away the Scriptures, which
hold the people in blindness, which flie the light,
which have their common prayers, minister the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
marry, bury their dead in a strange tongue,
that the people may understand nothing: which
make a famme of hearing the word of God: which
stop up the springs of the water of life: which take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

they have seemed most furiously to fly in the Popes face
as popularly zealous against Popery, and yet at the same
time by a strange giddiness, headiness, and madness, they
have risen up against that <hi>Mother-Church</hi> which bare them,
and those <hi>Fathers</hi> in it, who heretofore mightily defended
them and theirs from the <hi>talons</hi> and <hi>gripes</hi> of that <hi>Roman
Eagle:</hi> and this not with childish scufflings or light
skirmishings, to which manner of sight the illiterate
weakness and rudeness of our new Masters and Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
hath reduced those Controversies? but with such a
<hi>Panoply</hi> or compleat Armour of <hi>proof,</hi> such sharp Weapons,
such ponderous Engines, such rare dexterity of well-man-aged
Powers, raised from all Learning, both Divine and
Humane, that the high places and defences of <hi>Rome</hi>
were not able to stand before them heretofore, when
they were battered by our <hi>Jewels,</hi> our <hi>Lakes,</hi> our <hi>Dave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,</hi>
our <hi>Whites,</hi> our <hi>Halls,</hi> our <hi>Mortons,</hi> our <hi>Andrews,</hi>
and the late invincible <hi>Vsher,</hi> who deserved to be <hi>Primate,</hi>
not only of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but of all the Protestant Forces in the
world. All these were Bishops, Worthies of the first
three, seconded in their ranks by able and orderly Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,
as <hi>Whitakers, Perkins, Reynolds, Whites, Craken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorps,
Sutcliffs,</hi> and innumerable others, while our Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were orderly, our Marchings comely, and our Forces
both united and encouraged.</p>
               <p>Whereas, now there is no doubt but the merciless mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down and scattering of the <hi>Clergy of England,</hi> like Hay,
with the withering and decay of Government, Regularity

corrupt and abuse that ancient Purity, Simplicity, and

to <hi>conform</hi> to our <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> when they
protest, with so much <hi>truth,</hi> to our faces, they cannot see
any <hi>Church,</hi> any <hi>Religion</hi> among us, as <hi>uniform, publick,

goodliest figure and fairest presence of a <hi>Christian Church,</hi>
and the best <hi>Reformed</hi> of any, is now <hi>deformed, ruined,
demolished;</hi> nothing but scattered <hi>rafters</hi> and pieces of
that <hi>ship-wrackt vessel</hi> now appear floating up and down
in a restless and foaming sea of <hi>faction, opposition</hi> and <hi>confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>
between Bishops, Ministers and People: some are
<hi>Episcopal,</hi> others <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> a third sort <hi>Independant:</hi>
all are disparate or opposite in <hi>Discipline,</hi> some are Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodox
in <hi>Doctrine:</hi> the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> rise against all, and the
<hi>Quakers</hi> so are above all.</p>
               <p>To which of all these, with <hi>many other Sects,</hi> shall an
honest-hearted <hi>Papist</hi> apply himself, to be safe and setled
in Religion? If to the poor and depressed remains of
Bishops, and the Episcopal Clergie, who yet adhere to
the Church <hi>England;</hi> alas, they are weak and exhausted,
contemned by many, pitied some, but asserted by few or
none, according to their true merit in former ages, or
their present Worth, Courage, Constancy and Patience
in this. If the Romanists go to the Presbyterian party,
which like small shoots spring out so thick in <hi>England,</hi>
upon the cutting down of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> to which they all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
submitted; these, besides their Levity, Parity, and
In constancy, as to their former Stations, Opinions, and
Oaths, seem so unseasonably insolent, and magisterially
domineering, before they had got a full and just domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that all sober men think them rather popular, plebeian
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99359:13"/>
and impertinent in their heats, transport and passions,
than so modest, wise, and grave, as becomes those who
will undertake to wrest Government out of the hands of
their superiours and betters every way, and to impose a
novelty of untried and undesired Discipline upon such a
great and stout Nation as <hi>England</hi> is; which disdaining
the insolency of Popes, and offended at the indiscretion
of some Bishops, will hardly ever bear the pertnesse of
petty Presbyters, who cannot want Vanity, Impudence
and Arrogancy, when they fancy themselves in a supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
of Power above people, Parliaments and Princes:
for they affect no lesse, as Christ's due and theirs too. If
the tossed Romanists run to the spruce and self-conceited
Independents for shelter, because these fine new Masters
seem to have patents for Christian Liberty, and urge a
<hi>Magna Charta</hi> from Christ, to be accountable to none in
matters of Religion, but their own little Congregation,
Church, or Body, in which, as in an Ecclesiastick Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
or free Borough of Religion, they may hang and
draw, exercise high and low Justice upon mens souls as
they list in their little Conventicles; yet here the poor
Papist finds so much of a rude and exotick novelty, such
a grosse shew of Schisme, such variety, such an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency,
such a plebeian petulancy, such pitiful and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
affections, and arrogating of Church-power in
some of the plebs, and such contempt of it in others,
that he cannot think it is other than some pieces of <hi>Josephs</hi>
bloody coat, or some torn limbs of his body. Compared
to what Splendour, Order, Strength, Beauty, Unity,
Decency, and Majesty in Doctrine and Discipline, in
Faith and holy Duties, was formerly to be observed, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the envy and admiration of sober Papists, in
the Church of <hi>England;</hi> how much more in the Antient
and Catholick Churches grand combinations, from which
these petty fractions and crumblings of Christians seem
most abhorrent and dissonant?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:99359:13"/>
This goodly <hi>Cedar,</hi> then, of the Church of <hi>England</hi>
being thus broken and hewn down, and nothing like it,
or comparable to it, planted in its room, but such Shrubs
and Mushromes as grow of themselves out of the rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the earth (vulgar humours and passions) under
whose shade any Egyptian Vermine, Frogs, or unclean
Birds may hide themselves; no wonder if the Papists
triumph in their sufferings and constancies if they despise
all our Presbyterian, Independent, Anabaptistick, and
fanatick Novelties; if they rejoyce in that vengeance
which they conclude God hath made upon our Schismes,
Errours, Obstinacies, and Persecutions against them, by
our mutual confusions.</p>
               <p>Hence must daily and necessarily follow secret inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and accessions to the Roman party, by all those
who are not well grounded in the Reformed Religion,
or not much prejudiced against the Popish Errours, or
are indifferent for any Religion which is most easie or
pleasing. These at length will wrap to the Roman party,
as the most specious of any: so that unless there be a
speedy restauration of the honour of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
I see not how it is possible to prevent that fatal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapse,
either to Romish superstition and slavery, or else
to a dreadful persecution, which will in time necessarily
follow those dissipations and destructions of this Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Church, its Minstry, Government and Religion,
which some men have already too much, and still do,
beyond measure, so industriously promote, to the exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
joy and gratifying of the Popish party and designs,
which are not onely invasive upon the honour and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of this Nation, but highly scandalous to our Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Profession, and dangerous to our consciences, especially
as we yet stand convinced of the Errors, Superstitions and
Sacriledges of the Romish Religion since it lapsed from
the Primitive Institutions of Christ, the patterns of the
Apostles, the ancient Communion of Christian Churches,
and the fraternal Co-ordination of Bishops, who were
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99359:14"/>
alwayes united in orderly, happy, and harmonious
Aristocracies, rather than subordinate to any one Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archical
Supremacy, as to Ecclesiastical Power and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction:
however they had such regulation and primacy
of order, by Patriarchs and Metropolitans among Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and the representers of several Churches, as become
wise men, that were numerous when they met in great
Councils or Church Assemblies.</p>
               <p>Nor do these wilely Romanists exercise their malice
against this Reformed Church, onely with their own
strength and dexterity, but they have other oblique Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies
and sinister Practices by which they set on work
the hot heads and pragmatick hands of all other <hi>Sects,</hi>
who pretend the greatest Antipathies to popery, and yet
most promote its interests by their Factions and fanatick
Practises, by their heedlesse and, hedlesse their boundlesse
and endlesse Agitations, which blast all true Reformation,
and bring nothing but Division and Confusion.</p>
               <p>For among these there are a sort of people who affect
Supremacy in Church and state too, a spiritual and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Dominion, no lesse than doth the Pope of Rome:
there among them many petty Popes, who would fain
be the great and onely Dictators of Religion, whose
opinionative pride and projects are as yet of a lesse volume
and blinder print, but they every day mediate and
agitate new Editions of their power, and larger additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to their parties and designs; being as infallible in
their own conceits, as imperious in their spirits, and magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial
in their censures, as the proudest Popes of Rome;
not doubting to condemn and excommunicate any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Christians and Ministers, yea whole Christian
Churches, yea and the best Reformed in the world
(such as <hi>England</hi> was), if they be not just of
their form and fashion, or if they will not patiently sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to their multiform and deformed Reformations, by
which they daily with-draw true Reformation to such a
small thread, that losing its strength and integrity, it must
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99359:14"/>
needs snap in pieces and become uselesse: the strange
fires of blind, popular, preposterous and sacrilegious Zeal
so over-boyling true Religion and sober Reformation,
till they are utterly confounded and quenched with
such fordid and shamefull deformities, as must needs
follow their Divisions, Distractions and Despiciencies, as
to all Church-order, Christian unity and Ministerial au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
Thus many heady and giddy Professors
have been so eager to come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that they
are almost run out of their wits, and far beyond the
bounds of good consciences; so jealous of Superstition,
that they are Panders for Confusion; so scared with the
name of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they are afraid of all right Reason
and sober Religion; so fearful of being over-righteous
by following vain traditions of men, that they fear not
to be over-wicked, by over-throwing the good foundations
of Order, Honour, Peace and Charity, which Christ
and his Apostles have laid in his Church: fierce enemites
indeed against the Idolatry of Antichrist, but fast friends
to Belial and Mammon, to Schisme and Sacriledge;
which having no fellowship with God and Christ, must
needs belong to the party of Antichrist, which contains
a circle of Errours, while Christ is the centre of Truth:
And we know that parts diametrically opposite to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may (yet) make up the same circumferences and be
at equal distance from the centre; so may Practises and
Opinions which seem most crosse against each other,
yet at <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> alike conspire against Christ and
true Religion, like vicious extremes, which are contrary
to each other, and yet uncorrespondent with that virtue
from which they are divided.</p>
               <p>But the end or effect following their actions, (though
possibly not some of their intentions) will be this, to
prepare by these various windings, confused circulations
and distorted wrestings of the Reformed Religion, the
way for Roman factors, <hi>Papal</hi> interests and Jesuitick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes,
whose learned abilities, orderly industry, and
indefatigable activity is such, that by that time the old
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99359:15"/>
stock of Reverend, orderly and authoritative Bishops and
Presbyters, (the truest and most unquestionable Ministers
of the Church of Christ) are worn out in <hi>England,</hi> and
the reformed Religion is reduced with its titular and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate
Ministers to a meer medly, or popular Chaos of
confusions, (the most of sober people being either
sick, or shamed, or weary of their home bred disorders,
and unremedied diseases in Religion). By this time (I
say) the Romish agitators will not onely devour all
these petty parties, and feeble factions of Reformers, with
as much ease as the Stork did the Frogs; but they will
(in time) utterly destroy the remains of the defamed
Doctrine and deformed Religion, which your fore fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
owned, and to the death professed, as most true
and well reformed, with great Honour, Holiness, and
Happiness, which yet the ignorance and insolence, the
Illiterateness, and Rusticity, the Barrenesse and Barbarity
of novel Sects have already rendred poor and despicable,
much to be pitied and deplored both at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>
               <p>I must ever so far own my reason, as to professe that
I look upon the Defamers Dividers and Destroyers of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> (whatever they are or seem) to be no
other than the perdues or forelorn hope of Popery, which by
lighter skirmishes open advantages to the Popes main
Battaglio; the Vancourriers, or Harbingers, sent and
excited (in great part) from the Pragmatick Policies of
<hi>Rome,</hi> whose grand interest since the Reformation hath
been, not more to advance the House of Austria and
preserve the Papacy, than to regain the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
to the Romish slavery.</p>
               <p>Certainly these petty parties, who scarce know what
they drive at, and are full of varieties in their Fancies,
Forms and Factions, these cannot produce so constant a
current and so strong a tide, as is always urging against
the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the honour of the Reformed
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99359:15"/>
Religion; but they are driven on by a subtle and secret,
yet potent impulse, as waves of the sea, not onely
dashing and breaking upon each other, but (all of them)
battering the Honour and Stability of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as the great rampart or bank which stands in the
way of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> mightily opposing and hindering
heretofore both fanatick Confusions, Papal Usurpations,
and Romish Superstions; whose advantages now are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently
prepared and carried on by those, that under
the name of Reformation will most effectually at last o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow
it.</p>
               <p>For after these petty spirits, who have been and are
the great Dividers, Despisers and Destroyers of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Church of <hi>England,</hi> have a few years longer
played their mad pranks in this sometime so flourishing
and fruitful vineyard of the Lord, (pulling up the hedge
of Ecclesiastical Canons, and Civil Sanctions, throwing
down the wall of Ancient Discipline and Catholick Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
breaking in pieces the wine-press of holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and Ministerial Authority and Succession, pulling
up both root and branch of holy Plants and regular Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;)
what (I beseech you) can hinder these subtle
Foxes and wild Boars of Romish Power and Policy, to
enter in, and not onely secretly, but openly (as occasion
shall serve) to destroy all the remaining stock of the true
Protestants and Professors of the Reformed Religion;
who at first soberly protesting against Popish Errours
and Deformities, afterwards praying (in vain) for a
joynt and just Reformation, did (at last) reform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
after the rule of God's Word, interpreted by the
Catholick Practise of purest Antiquity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What (without a miracle)</hi> can hinder the Papal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency
in <hi>England,</hi> when once sound Doctrine is shaken,
corrupted, despised; when Scriptures are wrested by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
private interpreter; when the ancient Creeds and
Symbols, the Lords Prayers and Ten Comandments,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99359:16"/>
all wholsome forms of sound Doctrine and Devotion,
the Articles and Liturgy of such a Church, together with
the first famous Councils, all are slighted, vilified despited and
abhorred by such Englishmen as pretend to be great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers;
when neither pristine Respect nor Support,
Credit nor Countenance, Maintenance nor Reverence
shall be left either to the Reformed Religion or the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
of it? without which they will heardly be carried
on beyond the fate of Pharaohs Chariots, when their
wheeles were taken off, which is to be overwhelmed
and drowned in the Romish red <hi>Sea,</hi> which will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
overflow all, when once <hi>England</hi> is become not onely
a dunghill and Tophet of Heretical filth and Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
fire, but an Aceldama, or field of blood, by mutual
Animosities and civil Dissentions, arising from the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
and confusions of Religions.</p>
               <p>All which, as the Roman Eagle now fore-sees, and
so follows the camp of Sectaries (as Vultures and Birds
of prey are wont to do Armies) so no man, not blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with private passions and present interest, is so simple,
as not to know that it will in time terribly seize upon
the blind, dying, or dead carkase of this Church and
Nation; whose expiration will be very visible, when
the Purity, Order and Unity of Religion, the Respect,
Support and Authority of the Ministry is vanished and
banished out of <hi>England,</hi> by the neglect of some, the
Malice, Madnesse and Ingratitude of others, your most
unhappy Countrey-men: Then shall the <hi>Israel</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
return to the <hi>Egypt</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> then shall the beauty
of our <hi>Sion</hi> be captive to the bondage of <hi>Babylon's</hi> either
Superstition or Persecution; from both which I beseech
God to deliver us.</p>
               <p>As an Omen of the future fate, how many person
of fair Estates, others of good parts and hopefull Learning,
are already shrewdly warped and inclined to the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and either actually reconciled, or in a great readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99359:16"/>
to embrace that Communion (which excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
all Greek and Latine Churches, Eastern, We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
and African Christians, which will not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to its Dominion and Superstition) chiefly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
thereto, because they know not what to make
of or expect from the Religion and Reformation
of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> which they see so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
zealous to reproach and ruine, so few concerned
to relieve, restore, or pity?</p>
               <p>As for the return of you (my noble Countrey-men)
and your Posterity to the Roman Subjection and
Superstition. I doubt not but many of you, most of
you, all of you, that are persons of judicious and conscientious
Piety, do heartily deprecate it, and would seriously
avoid it to the best of your skill and power, as indeed
you have great cause, both in Prudence and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
in Piety and Policy: yet I believe none of
you can flatter your selves, that the next Century
shall defend the Reformed Religion in <hi>England</hi> from
Romish Pretensions, Perswasions and Prevalencies, as
the last hath done, while the Dignity, Order and
Authority of the Ministry, the Government of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Bishops, the Majesty and Unity of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Church and its Religion, were all main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the unanimous vote, consent and Power of all
Estates.</p>
               <p>Nay, the Dilemma and distressed choice of Religion
is now reduced to this, that many peaceable and well-minded
Christians, having been so long harressed,
bitten and worried with novell Factions and pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Reformations, would rather chuse that there Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
(if they may but have the excuse of ignorance
in the main controversies, to plead for Gods mercy
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99359:17"/>
in their joyning to that Communion which hath
so strong a relish of <hi>Egyptian</hi> Leeks and Onions, of
Idolatry and Superstition, besides unchristian Arrogancy
and intolerable Ambition; that their Posterity, (I say)
shall return to the Roman party, which hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
among them setled, orderly and uniform, becoming
Religion, than to have them ever turning and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
upon <hi>Ixion's</hi> wheel, catching in vain at fanciful
Reformations, as <hi>Tantalus</hi> at the deceitful waters,
rolling with infinite pains and hazard the Reformed
Religion, like <hi>Sisyphus</hi> his Stone, sometimes assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it by Law and Power, otherwhile exposing it
to popular Liberty and Looseness; than to have
them tossed to and fro with every wind of Doctrine,
with the Faedities, Blasphemies, Animosities, Anarchies,
Dangers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and confusions, attending fanatick Fancies
and quotidian Reformations, which like botches or
boiles from surfeited and unwholsome bodies, do daily
break out among those Christians, who have made
no rule of Religion but their own humours, and no
bounds of their Reformations but their own Interests;
the first makes them ridiculous, the second pernicious to
all sober Christians.</p>
               <p>Whereas the Roman Church, however tainted
with rank Errours and dangerous Corruptions in
Doctrine and Manners (which forbid us under our
present convictions to have in those things any visible
sacred communion with them, though we have a great
charity and pity for them; Charity in what they
still retain good; Pity, in what they have erred from
the Rule and Example of Christ and his Catholick
Church;) yet it cannot be denied, without a brutish
blindness and injurious slander (which onely serves to
gratifie the gross Antipathies of the gaping vulgar)
that the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> among its Tares and Cockle,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99359:17"/>
its Weeds and Thornes hath many wholsome Herbs,
and holy Plants growing; much more of Reason and
Religion, of good Learning and sober Industry, of
Order and Polity, of Morality and Constancy, of
Christian Candor and Civility, of common Honesty
and Humanity, becoming grave men and Christians,
by which to invite after-Ages and your Posterity to
adhere to it and them, rather than to be everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
exposed to the profane bablings, endless janglings,
miserable manglings, childing confusions, Atheistical
indifferencies and sacrilegious furies of some later spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
which are equally greedy and giddy, making
both a play and a prey of Religion, who have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in them comparable to the Papal party, to
deserve your or your Posteritie's admiration or imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but rather their greatest caution and prevention:
For you will find what not I onely, but sad experience
of others may tell you, that the sythes and pitch-forks
of these petty Sects and Plebeian Factions will be as
sharp and heavy as the Papists Swords and Faggots
heretofore were, both to your religious and civil
Happiness.</p>

               <p>WIth our contentions their irreligious humor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
is much strengthened; nothing pleaseth
them better than these manifold oppositions about
the matter of Religion, as well for that they have
the more opportunity to learn on one side, how the
other may be oppugned, and so weaken the credit
of all unto themselves; as also because by their hot
pursuit of lower Controversies amongst men professing
Religion, and agreeing in the principal foundations
thereof, time will cause Alteration to grow: For which
purpose when they see occasion they stick not some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in other mens persons, yea sometimes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any vizard at all, directly to try, what the most
religious are able to say in defence of the highest
points, whereupon all Religion dependteh. Now
for the most part it so falleth out touching things that
are generally received, that although in themselves
they be most certain, yet because men presume them
granted of all, we are hardly able to bring such proof
of their certainty, as may satisfie gainsayers, when
suddenly, and besides expectation they require the same
at our hands, which unpreparation and unreadiness,
when they find in us, they turn it to the soothing
up of themselves in that accursed fancy, whereby they
would fain believe that the hearty devotion of such
as indeed fear God, is nothing else but a kind of harm
less Error, bred and confirmed in them by the flight
of wiser men.</p>
