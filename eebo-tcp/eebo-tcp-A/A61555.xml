            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reverend
CLERGY
OF THE
DIOCESE
OF
WORCESTER.</head>
            <opener>My Brethren,</opener>
            <p>THE following Discourses do
of Right belong to You;
the Substance of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
contained in what I delivered
to You in several Times and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
in the Course of my <hi>Visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi>
In which I endeavoured to lay
open the <hi>Nature</hi> and Dignity of
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:100520:3"/>
your Function, the Rules you are to
observe in the Discharge of it, and
to state and resolve the most Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Cases which Relate to your
<hi>Duties</hi> and <hi>Rights,</hi> according to
the Principles both of <hi>Law</hi> and
<hi>Conscience.</hi> For I observed that
some had spoken very well of the
General Nature of the Ecclesiastical
Function, without a particular Regard
to the Limitations of the Exercise of it
by our Laws. Others had endeavoured
to give Advice and Counsel in Point
of Law, who meddle not with the
Obligation of Conscience. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I thought it necessary to joyn
both these together, that you might
have a clear and distinct View of
your Duties in both Respects. For
in a Matter of Positive Institution,
where only the General Duties are
prescribed in Scripture, and the
Bounds of the Exercise of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the Laws of the Land, I
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:100520:3"/>
could not see how any Person could
satisfie himself in the Discharge of
his Duty, without a Regard to both.
For the Care of Souls in General, is
a Matter of wonderful Weight and
Importance, and can never be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
considered by those who are
concerned in it. But no Man among
us takes upon him an Indefinite
Care of Souls, without Regard to
Persons or Places; for that would
produce Confusion and endless Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and Perplexities of Conscience
about the Nature and Obligation to
Particular Duties,</p>
            <p>Which cannot be prevented or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
without a right understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the different Respect all that
have taken our Holy Function upon
them, do stand in both to the
Church in General, and to that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Cure of Souls which they are
admitted to. The best way I know
to represent them, is to consider
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:100520:4"/>
the Case of Dominion and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and how far the Vniversal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of Mankind to promote each
others Good, is consistent with the Care
of their own and Families Welfare.
<hi>Adam</hi> had in himself the Entire
and Original Dominion over all those
Things, which after became the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of particular Property; when
his Posterity found it necessary to
make and allow several Shares and
Allotments to distinct Families, so as
they were not to incroach, or break
in upon one another. But the Law
of Nature did not prescribe the Way
and Method of Partition, but left
that to <hi>Occupancy</hi> or <hi>Compact:</hi>
And so the Heads of Families upon
their Settlement in any Countrey,
had a twofold Obligation upon them;
the first was to preserve the Interest
of the whole Body, to which they still
were bound, and were to shew it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such Occasions as required it. The
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:100520:4"/>
next was to take particular Care of
these Shares which belonged to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
so as to improve them for
their Service, and to protect them
from the Invasion of others. And
Although this Division of Property
was not made by any Antecedent Law,
yet being once made, and so useful
to Mankind, the Violation of it, by
taking that which is anothers Right,
is a manifest Violation of the Law of
Nature.</p>
            <p>I do not think, that the Distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Ecclesiastical Cures, for the
greater Benefit of the People, is of
so strict a Nature; because the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Property doth not extend to
this Case in such a manner. But
since an Vniversal Good is carried
on by such a Division far better than
it could be without it, there is an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
lying on all Persons who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
it, to preserve that Order which
conduces to so good an End. And
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:100520:5"/>
I cannot see how any Persons can bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
justifie the Breach of Parochial
Communion as such, than others can
justifie the Altering the Bounds of
Mens Rights and Properties, because
they apprehend that the common Good
may be best promoted by returning to
the first Community of all things.</p>
            <p>If our <hi>Blessed Saviour,</hi> or his
<hi>Holy Apostles</hi> in the first founding
of Churches, had determined the
Number of Persons, or fixed the Bounds
of Places within which those who
were ordained to so holy a Function,
were to take care of the Souls commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to them, there could have been
no Dispute about it among those who
owned their Authority. But their
Business was to lay down the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
of such as were fit to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in it; to set before them the
Nature of their Duties, and the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
they must give of the Discharge
of them; and to Exhort all such as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:100520:5"/>
took it to a Watchfulness, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
in their Places; but they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
go about to limit the Precincts,
within which they were to Exercise
the Duties incumbent upon them.</p>
            <p>When Churches were first planted
in several Countries, there could be
no such things expected as <hi>Parochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Divisions;</hi> for these were the
Consequents of the General spreading
of <hi>Christianity</hi> among the People.
As is evident in the best Account we
have of the Settlement of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial
Clergy</hi> among us, after
<hi>Christianity</hi> was received by the
<hi>Saxons.</hi> Which was not done all at
once, but by several Steps and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.
It cannot be denied by any,
that are conversant in our Histories,
that the Nation was gradually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
from <hi>Paganism</hi> by the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Endeavours of some Bishops and
their Clergy in the several Parts of
<hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:100520:6"/>
Not by Commission from one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
(as is commonly supposed) but
several Bishops came from several
Places, and applied themselves to
this Excellent Work, and God gave
them considerable Success in it. Thus
<hi>Bizinus</hi> did great Service among the
<hi>West Saxons;</hi> and <hi>Felix</hi> the <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundian</hi>
among the <hi>East-Saxons;</hi>
and the <hi>Northern</hi> Bishops in the
<hi>Midland-Parts,</hi> as well as <hi>Augustin</hi>
and his Companions in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Kent.</hi> And in these <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land-parts,</hi>
as <hi>Christianity</hi> increased,
so the <hi>Bishops Sees</hi> were mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied
(Five out of One) and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the most convenient Distan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
for the further inlarging and
establishing <hi>Christianity</hi> among the
People. The Bishops were Resident
in their own Sees, and had their
Clergy then about them, whom they
sent abroad, as they saw cause, to
those Places where they had the
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:100520:6"/>
fairest Hopes of Success. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
thereto they either continued
or removed them, having yet no fixed
<hi>Cures</hi> or <hi>Titles.</hi> All the first <hi>Titles</hi>
were no other than being entred
in the Bishops Register, as of his
Clergy, from which Relation none
could discharge himself, without the
Bishop's Consent. But as yet the
Clergy had no Titles to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Places, there being no fixed
Bounds of Parishes, wherein any
Persons were obliged to be Resident
for the better Discharge of their
Duties. This State of an Vnfixed
and Itinerant Clergy was soon found
to be very inconvenient; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all Incouragement was given,
where <hi>Christianity</hi> most prevailed,
for the building Churches at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
Distance from the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral,
and setling a Number of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
together there, which were after
called <hi>Collegiate-Churches;</hi> and
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:100520:7"/>
the Great and Devout Men of that
Time gave them Liberal Endowments
that they might the better attend the
Service of God there, and in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
about them.</p>
            <p>But after that the several Parts
grew to be more populous, and Lords
of Manors, for the Conveniency of
themselves and their Tenants, were
willing to erect Churches within their
Precincts, Laws were then made,
that they might detain one Share
of the Tithes for the Supply of this
New Church; the other two remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
due to the <hi>Mother Church.</hi>
And I can find nothing like any Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
for the Lords of Manors to
appropriate the other Two Parts as
they thought fit. For those Manors
themselves were but Parcels of lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Parishes; and the Tithes were
due from those Estates, which were
no part of their Manors, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they had nothing to do with
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xi" facs="tcp:100520:7"/>
But after the <hi>Norman</hi> Invasion,
the poor <hi>Parochial Clergy</hi> being
<hi>Saxons,</hi> and the Nobility and Bishops
<hi>Normans,</hi> they regarded not how
much they reduced the Inferiour Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
to enrich the Monasteries belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Normans,</hi> either at home
or abroad. And this I take to be the
true Reason of the Multitude of <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations</hi>
of Two <hi>Thirds of the
Tithes</hi> in the <hi>Norman Times,</hi> and
too often with the Consent of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
who ought to have shewed more
Regard to the Interest of the <hi>Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial
Clergy</hi> than they generally did.<note place="margin">Pag. 277, &amp;c.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But of this I have discoursed more
at large in one of the following Cases.</p>
            <p>In the latter end of the <hi>Saxon
Times,</hi> if we believe those called the
<hi>Confessors Laws,</hi> after all the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
Devastations, <hi>there were Three
or Four Churches where there had
been but One before.</hi> By which it
appears that the <hi>Parochial Clergy</hi>
               <pb n="xii" facs="tcp:100520:8"/>
were Numerous before the Conquest.
And within this <hi>Diocess,</hi> in Two
<hi>Deanaries</hi> of it, there are to be found
in <hi>Doomsday-Book</hi> above Twenty
Parish-Churches: In the Deanary of
<hi>Warwick,</hi> Ten; and in the Deanary
of <hi>Kingstone,</hi> Fifteen: But of the
former <hi>Seven</hi> were Appropriated in
the <hi>Norman Times;</hi> and of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>Ten;</hi> by which we may see to how
low a Condition they then brought the
<hi>Parochial Clergy.</hi> One Church in the
former Deanary I find built in that
time, and that was at <hi>Exhal;</hi> which
was before a <hi>Chapel</hi> to <hi>Salford,</hi> but
was erected in the time of <hi>H.</hi> 1. by
the Lord of the Manor and Freehol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
who gave the Glebe and Tithes,
as appears by the Confirmation of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Worcester.</hi> Many
other <hi>Parochial Churches,</hi> I doubt
not, were built and endowed after the
same manner, although the Records
of them are lost. And as Churches
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:100520:8"/>
were new erected, the Parochial
Bounds were fixed, that the People
might certainly know whither they
were to resort for Divine Worship, who
were bound to attend them as part of
their Charge, from whose Hands they
were to receive the Holy Sacraments,
and whose Advice and Counsel they
were to take in Matters which related
to the Salvation of their Souls. Now
here lies the main Difficulty with some
People; they cannot think that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial
Bounds are to determine them
in what concerns the Good of their
Souls; but if they can edifie more by
the Parts and Gifts of another, they
conclude, that it is their Duty to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
their own Minister, and go to
such a one as they like. I meddle not
with extraordinary Occasions of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
nor with the Case of <hi>Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Incumbents,</hi> because it is the
Peoples Fault if they be not prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and the Place supplied by better
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:100520:9"/>
Men. But the Case, as it ought to
be put, is, how far a Regard is to be
shewed to a Constitution so much
for the General Good, as that of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial
Communion</hi> is. We do not
say, That Mens Consciences are
bound by <hi>Perambulations,</hi> or that
it is a Sin at any time to go to
another Parish; but we say, That a
constant fixed <hi>Parochial Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi>
tends more to preserve the
Honour of God, and the Religion
Established among us, to promote
Peace and Vnity among Neighbours,
and to prevent the Mischief of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
And what advances so good
Ends, is certainly the best Means of
Edification: Which lies not in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Fansie, or warming the
Passions, but in what brings Men to
a due Temper of Mind, and a holy,
peaceable, and unblameable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation.
And as to these Excellent
Ends, it is not only your Duty with
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:100520:9"/>
great Zeal and Diligence to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
your People to them; but to
go before them your selves in the
Practice of them. For they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have any hearty Regard or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
for what any one says, if they
find him to contradict it in the
Course of his Life. Suppose it be
the Peoples Fault to shew so little
Regard to your Profession; yet you
are bound to consider how far you
may have given too much Occasion for
it, and their Fault can be no Excuse
for you, if any of your own were the
true Occasion of theirs.</p>
            <p>We live in an Age wherein the
Conversations of the Clergy are more
observed than their Doctrines. Too
many are busie in finding out the
Faults of the Clergy, the better to
cover their own; and among such
<hi>Priest craft</hi> is become the most po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
Argument for their Insidelity.
If they could once make it appear;
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:100520:10"/>
that all Religion were nothing but
a Cheat and Imposture of some cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Men for their own Advantage,
who believed nothing of it themselves;
and that all the business of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
was to support such a Fraud
in the World for our own Interest,
they were very excusable in their
most bitter Invectives against such
<hi>Priest-craft.</hi> For nothing is more
to be abhorred by Men of Ingenuous
Minds, and Natural Probity, than
to be the Instruments of Deceiving
Mankind in so gross a manner. But,
thanks be to God, this is very far
from being the Case among us; for
our Profession is built upon the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of God and Providence, the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of Good and Evil, and the
Rewards and Punishments of another
Life. If these things have no Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
we are certain that the best,
and wisest, and most disinterested
Men in all Ages have been in the
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:100520:10"/>
same Fundamental Mistakes. And it
is now somewhat too late for any
Persons to set up for Sagacity and
true Iudgment in these Matters, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all those of foregoing Ages.
There is a mighty Difference between
slight and superficial Reasonings,
(although some may be vain enough
to cry them up for <hi>Oracles)</hi> and
those which are built on the Nature
of Things, and have born the Test
of so many Ages, and remain still in
the same Degree of Firmness and
Strength, notwithstanding all the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
of Profane and Atheistical
Wits. For it cannot be denied, that
such there have been in former times
as well as now; but that makes more
for the Advantage of Religion, that
our Modern Pretenders are fain to
borrow from the old Stock; and
scarce any thing worth Answering hath
been said by them, but hath been often
said, and with more Force by their
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:100520:11"/>
Masters. And the best Philosophers
of this Age have given up the Cause
of Atheism as indefensible; so that
the Being of God and Providence
seems to be established by a General
Consent; and if any secretly be of
another Mind, they think it not for
their Reputation to own it.</p>
            <p>The main Pretence now is against
<hi>Revealed Religion;</hi> but without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
to shew how so great and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
a Part of Mankind as the
<hi>Christian Church</hi> hath been made
up of, came to be so imposed upon, as
to a Doctrine which advances Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to the greatest Height, and gives
Mankind the most assured Hopes of
a Blessed Immortality, when nothing
like Interest and Design as to this
World, could be carried on by the
First and Greatest Promoters of it.<note place="margin">Histoire des O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

But we are told in a late Complaint
made abroad by a Friend of our
<hi>Deists</hi>
               <note place="margin">Août, 1697. p. 551.</note> (wherein I am particularly
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:100520:11"/>
concerned) <hi>That we make Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
for them which are most
easie to answer, and pass over their
most considerable Difficulties.</hi>
Which is a very unjust Charge, and
cannot be made good but by produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
those <hi>Considerable Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
which we have taken no Notice
of. For my part, I know of none such:
and <hi>we make no Objections for
them;</hi> however, we may think it our
Duty to lay open the Weakness of
them, when we are importuned to do
it; which was my Case in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
I suppose he refers to. If they
keep their <hi>Considerable Difficulties</hi>
to themselves. I know not how we
should be able to answer them. But
it is the common way in a baffled
Cause still to pretend, that the <hi>main
Difficulties</hi> were not produced.</p>
            <p>But this is not a proper Occasion
to insist lon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er on these Matters; my
present Business is to answer the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:100520:12"/>
which immediately regards
the Clergy; and the Summ of it is,
That our Profession rather hinders
than confirms the Belief of Religion;
<hi>because they who plead for what
makes for their Interest, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
suspected to be swayed more
by Interest than by Reason.</hi> To give
a full and clear Answer to this, we
must consider, That however Mankind
are apt to be swayed by Interest, yet
the Truth and Reason of Things do
not at all depend upon them; for a
Thing is not true or false in it self,
because it makes for or against a
Man; and the Measures of judging
Truth and Falshood, are quite of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Nature; and so Mens Interests
come not into Consideration. So that
in this Case they are not to examine
whose Turn is served, whether such a
Thing be true or false; but whether
there be sufficient Evidence to convince
an impartial Mind of the Truth of
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:100520:12"/>
it; for let the Reasons be produced
by whom they please, the Grounds
of Conviction are the same. If a
Man in a Dispute about Surveying
a piece of Land, which he claimed
a Right to, should appeal to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements
of Geometry in his Case,
would the Evidence be less because
he was concerned in the Land?</p>
            <p>But we proceed farther; Suppose
it be for the Interest of Religion in a
Nation, for an Order of Men to be
set apart on purpose to attend the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
of it; and that there should be
great Incouragements for their Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
and a Maintenance set apart
for their Subsistence afterwards, that
they may not live in Dependance on
the Humours and uncertain Fancies
of the People; how can such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
take off from the Credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of that Religion which they are
to support? Was it any lessening to
the Authority of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi>
               <pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:100520:13"/>
that the <hi>Tribe of Levi</hi> was so plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
provided for by God's own
Appointment? They were <hi>to teach
the Law to the People</hi> in the
Places where they were dispersed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the several Tribes: And sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it had been then said, Why should
we believe what you say, when you
live by it? You have Cities, and
Lands, and Tithes, and Oblations,
and Dignities among you; no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
you set up this Law as Divine
and Holy; but we get nothing by it,
but part with a Share of our Profits
to maintain you? What then? Was
the Law therefore false, and <hi>Moses</hi>
an Impostor? These are hard Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences,
but they naturally follow
from such a Supposition. And if such
an Inference were not reasonable then,
neither will it appear to be so now.</p>
            <p>But we do not pretend that the
Parochial Settlement of our Clergy is
by such a Divine Law as the Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:100520:13"/>
Priesthood was; but this we
do insist upon, That the Christian
Religion being owned and establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Nation, there was a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Reason from the Nature of it,
and the Obligation to Preserve and
Support it, that there should be an
Order of Men set apart for that
End, that they should instruct the
People in it, and perform the several
Offices belonging to it; and that a
sufficient Maintenance be allowed
them by the Law of the Land to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
them in doing their Duties.
And I appeal to any Men of Sense or
of common Vnderstanding, whether
on Supposition that our Religion is
true, these be not very just and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Things? How then can that
make a Religion suspected to be false,
which are very reasonable, supposing
it to be true? If it be true, as most
certainly it is, are not they bound to
maintain it to be true? And can it
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:100520:14"/>
be the less so, because their Subsistence
depends upon it? Therefore all the
Impertinent Talk of <hi>our Profession
being a Trade,</hi> can signifie nothing
to any Men that understand the
Difference between <hi>Scarron</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clid,</hi>
or the way of <hi>Burlesquing</hi> and
of <hi>Demonstration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is still one common Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
to be removed, and that is, <hi>That
too many of those who preach up
our Religion, as true, do not live
as if they believed it to be so.</hi> We
are very sorry, there should be any
Occasion given for such a Reproach
as this; and we hope there are not
so many Instances of it, as some would
have it believed. <hi>Woe be to those
by whom such Offences come.</hi>
But supposing the Instances true, is
there any Religion in the World, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the Follies and Infirmities
of Mankind, which can secure all the
Professors of it from acting against
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:100520:14"/>
the Rules of it? But if such Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are sufficiently proved, there ought
to be the greater Severity used in
such Cases; because Religion it
self, as well as the Honour of our
Church, suffers so much by them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it will still be said,</hi> That
these Persons are secret Infidels,
and believe nothing of what they
profess.</p>
            <p>This is another Point, how far
bad Lives are consistent with sound
Opinions: Some that think that Men
act consistently, will not allow that
Bad Men can be any other than meer
Infidels; but others who consider the
Prevalency of Mens Lusts and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
over their Reasons, are apt to
think that they may retain their
good Opinions, even when they act
contrary to them: But then their
Consciences fly in their Faces, and
they condemn themselves for their
evil Actions. And then these very
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:100520:15"/>
Instances are an Argument against In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity;
for we may justly presume,
that they would shake off their Fears
of another World, if they could. But
why should some Instances of this
Nature signifie more against Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
than the many Remarkable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of a <hi>Godly, Righteous and
Sober Life</hi> among the Clergy, to a
stronger Confirmation of it? For they
have had greater Occasion of search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into all the <hi>Considerable Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties</hi>
about Religion, than others
can pretend to; and I do not know
any that have imployed most Time
and Pains about it, but have
had greater Satisfaction as to the
<hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Excellency</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the most common Prejudices
of our Times, against our Profession.
It would now be proper for me to
give some particular Directions to
you, but that is so much the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:100520:15"/>
of the following Discourses, that

Ancient as well as Modern Practice
of <hi>Episcopal Visitations,</hi> and as near as
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100520:18"/>
I could, to observe the Rules prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
therein, with respect to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
who are now summoned to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.
And I find there were two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Parts in them, a <hi>Charge</hi> and an
<hi>Enquiry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Charge</hi> was given by the <hi>Bishop</hi>
himself,<note place="margin">Regino. l. 2. p. 205.</note> and was called <hi>Admonitio E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopi,</hi>
or <hi>Allocutio;</hi> wherein he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
them of their Duty,<note place="margin">Hispan. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. p. 29.</note> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
them to perform it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Enquiry</hi> was made according
to certain Articles drawn out of the
<hi>Canons,</hi> which were generally the
same;<note place="margin">Regino Collect. Canon. lib. 2. p. 204.</note> according to which the <hi>Iura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores
Synodi</hi> (as the ancient <hi>Canonists</hi>
call them;<note place="margin">Burchard. l. 1. c. 91, 92.</note> or <hi>Testes Synodales)</hi> were
to give in their <hi>Answers</hi> upon Oath;<note place="margin">Gratian 35. q. 5. c. 7.</note>
which was therefore called <hi>Iuramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
Synodale;</hi> for the <hi>Bishop's Visitation</hi>
was accounted an <hi>Episcopal Synod.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The former of these is my present
business; and I shall take leave to
speak my Mind freely to you, this
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100520:18"/>
first time, concerning several things
which I think most useful, and fit to
be considered and practised by the
Clergy of this <hi>Diocese.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, since it hath pleased God, by
his wise and over-ruling Providence,
(without my seeking) to bring me
into this Station in his Church, I shall
esteem it the best Circumstance of my
present Condition, if he please to make
me an Instrument of <hi>doing good</hi> among
you. To this end, I thought it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
<hi>in the first place,</hi> most humbly to
implore his Divine Assistance, that I
might both rightly understand, and
conscientiously perform that great
Duty which is incumbent upon me;
for without his help, all our Thoughts
are vain, and our best Purposes will
be ineffectual. But God is not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to those who sincerely endeavour
to know, and to do their Duty;
and therefore in the <hi>next place,</hi> I set
my self (as far as my Health and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100520:19"/>
Occasions would permit) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Extent</hi> of my
Duty; with a Resolution not to be
discouraged, altho I met with Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
in the Performance of it. For
such is the State and Condition of the
World, That no Man can design to
to do good in it; but when that cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
the particular <hi>Interests</hi> and <hi>Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of others, he must expect to
meet with as much Trouble as their
unquiet Passions can give him.</p>
            <p>If we therefore consulted nothing
but our own Ease, the only way were
to let People follow their Humours
and Inclinations, and to be as little
concerned as might be, at what they
either say or do. For if we go about to
rowze and awaken them, and much
more to reprove and reform them,
we shall soon find them uneasie and
impatient; for few love to hear of
their Faults, and fewer to amend
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:100520:19"/>
But it is the peculiar Honour of
<hi>the Christian Religion,</hi> to have an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Men set apart, not meerly as
<hi>Priests,</hi> to offer <hi>Sacrifices</hi> (for that all
Religions have had) but as <hi>Preachers
of Righteousness,</hi> to set Good and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
before the People committed to
their Charge; to inform them of their
Duties, to reprove them for their
Miscarriages; and that, not in order
to their Shame, but their Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Which requires not only <hi>Zeal,</hi>
but <hi>Discretion,</hi> and a great Mixture of
<hi>Courage</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> that we may
neither fail in doing our Duty, nor in
the best means of attaining the end
of it.</p>
            <p>If we could reasonably suppose,
that all those who are bound to tell
others their Duties, would certainly
do their own, there would be less
need of any such Office in the Church
as that of <hi>Bishops;</hi> who are to inspect,
and govern, and visit, and reform
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100520:20"/>
those who are <hi>to watch</hi> over others.
But since there may be too great fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
even in these; too great neglect
in some, and disorder in others; too
great proneness to Faction and Schism,
and impatience of Contradiction from
mere Equals; therefore St. <hi>Ierom</hi>
himself grants, That to avoid these
Mischiefs, there was a necessity of a
Superiour <hi>Order to Presbyters</hi> in the
<hi>Church of God;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hieron Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. ad Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</note> 
               <hi>ad quem omnis Ecclesiae

               </note> 
               <hi>&amp; Schismatum semina
tollerentur;</hi> as he speaks, even where
he seems most to lessen the Authority
of Bishops. But whatever some Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of his may be, (when the
<hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and the <hi>Roman
Deacons</hi> came into his head) his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are very much for the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of Episcopal Government. For
can any Man say more in point of
Reason for it, than <hi>that nothing but
Faction and Disorder followed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Presbyters, and therefore
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100520:20"/>
the whole Christian Church agreed in the
necessity of a higher Order,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Advers. Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferian.</note> 
               <hi>and that the
Peace and Safety of the Church depends
upon it; that if it be taken away, nothing
but Schisms and Confusions will follow.</hi>
I wish those who magnifie S. <hi>Ierom</hi>'s
<hi>Authority</hi> in <hi>this matter,</hi> would submit
to his <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> both, as
to the Necessity and Usefulness of the
Order of <hi>Bishops</hi> in the Church.</p>
            <p>But beyond this, in several places,<note place="margin">Hier. in Psal. ad Evagr.</note>
he makes the <hi>Bishops to be Successors
of the Apostles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ad Marcel. Cyprian.</note> as well as the rest of
the most Eminent Fathers of the
Church have done.<note place="margin">Ep. 3 66. Aug. in Ps. 44. 44.</note> If the <hi>Apostolical
Office,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ambros. ad Eph. 4. 11.</note> as far as it concerns the Care
and Government of Churches,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 28.</note> were
not to continue after their Decease,<note place="margin">Theod. ad 1 Tim. 1. 3.</note>
how came the best, the most learned,
the nearest to the <hi>Apostolical</hi> Times,
to be so wonderfully deceiv'd? For
if the Bishops did not succeed by the
<hi>Apostles</hi> own Appointment, they must
be <hi>Intruders</hi> and <hi>Usurpers</hi> of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100520:21"/>
               <hi>Function;</hi> and can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
the Church of God would have
so universally consented to it? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
the Apostles did not die all
at once; but there were <hi>Successors</hi> in
several of the <hi>Apostolical Churches,</hi> while
some of the <hi>Apostles</hi> were living: Can
we again imagine, those would not
have vindicated <hi>the Right</hi> of their
own <hi>Order,</hi> and declared to the
Church, That <hi>this Office</hi> was peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
to themselves? The Change of
the Name from <hi>Apostles</hi> to <hi>Bishops,</hi>
would not have been sufficient Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
for them; for the Presumption
had been as great in the Exercise of
the Power without the Name. So
that I can see no <hi>Medium,</hi> but that
either the Primitive Bishops did suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the <hi>Apostles</hi> by <hi>their own Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
and <hi>Approbation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iren. l. 3. c. 3.</note> (which <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi>
expresly affirms, <hi>Qui ab Apostolis
ipsis instituti sunt Episcopi in Ecclesiis)</hi>
or else those who governed the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100520:21"/>
Churches after them, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went
<hi>Diotrephes</hi> himself; for he only
<hi>rejected</hi> those whom the <hi>Apostles</hi> sent;
but <hi>these</hi> assumed to <hi>themselves</hi> the
<hi>Exercise</hi> of an <hi>Apostolical</hi> Authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Churches planted and setled
by them.<note place="margin">3 Iohn 9, 10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But to let us see how far the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
were from thinking that this
Part of their <hi>Office</hi> was peculiar to
themselves, we find them in their
own time, as they saw occasion, to
appoint others to take care of the
Government of the Churches, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
such bounds as they thought fit.
Thus <hi>Timothy</hi> was appointed by St.
<hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Ephesus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 2, 3, &amp;c.</note> to examine the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications
of such as were to be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained;
<hi>and not to lay hands suddenly
on any; to receive Accusations,</hi>
               <note place="margin">5. 22.</note> if there
were cause,<note place="margin">19.</note> even <hi>against Elders;</hi> to
proceed judicially <hi>before two or three
Witnesses:</hi> and if there were Reason,
to give <hi>them a publick Rebuke.</hi>
               <note place="margin">20.</note> And
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100520:22"/>
that this ought not to be <hi>thought</hi> a
<hi>slight matter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">21.</note> he presently adds, <hi>I
charge thee before God, and the Lord
Iesus Christ, and the elect Angels, that
thou observe these things, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
one before another, doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by partiality.</hi> Here is a very
strict and severe Charge for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Exercise of Discipline in the
Church upon Offenders. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in the Epistle to <hi>Titus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Titus 1. 5.</note> he be
only in general required <hi>to set in
order the things that are wanting, and
to ordain Elders in every City, as he had
appointed him;</hi> yet we are not to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that this Power extended not
to a <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> over them when he
had Ordained them. For if any of
those whom he Ordained (as belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>them</hi> qualified according to the
Apostles Rules) should afterwards
demean themselves otherwise, and
be <hi>self-willed, froward, given to Wine,
Brawlers, Covetous,</hi> or any way scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100520:22"/>
to the Church, can we believe
that <hi>Titus</hi> was not as well bound to
correct them afterwards, as to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
them before? And what was
this Power of <hi>Ordination</hi> and <hi>Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
but the very same which the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
have exercised ever since the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi>
Times? But they who go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to <hi>Unbishop Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi>
may as well <hi>Unscripture the Epistles</hi>
that were written to them; and make
them only some <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Writings,</hi> as they make <hi>Timothy</hi>
and <hi>Titus</hi> to have been only some <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi>
and <hi>occasional Officers.</hi> But <hi>the
Christian Church</hi> preserving these <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi>
as of constant and perpetual
use, did thereby suppose the same
kind of Office to continue, for the
sake whereof those excellent Epistles
were written: And we have no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Assurance that these <hi>Epistles</hi> were
written by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> than we have
that there were <hi>Bishops</hi> to succeed the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100520:23"/>
               <hi>Apostles</hi> in the Care and Government
of Churches.</p>
            <p>Having said thus much to clear
the Authority we act by, I now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to consider the <hi>Rules</hi> by which
we are to govern our selves.</p>
            <p>Every <hi>Bishop</hi> of this Church, in
the time of his Consecration makes
a solemn Profession, among other
things, <q>That he will not only
maintain and set forward, as much
as lies in him, quietness, love and
peace among all Men; but that he
will correct and punish such as be
unquiet, disobedient, and crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
within his Diocese, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to such Authority as he hath
by <hi>God's Word,</hi> and to him shall
be committed by the <hi>Ordinance of
this Realm.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>So that we have two</hi> Rules <hi>to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
by,</hi> viz. The Word of God, <hi>and
the</hi> Ecclesiastical Law of this Realm.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:100520:23"/>
(1) <hi>By the Word of God;</hi> and that
requires from us, Diligence, and Care,
and Faithfulness, and Impartiality,
<hi>remembring the Account we must give,
that we may do it with Ioy and not with
Grief.</hi> And we are not meerly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to correct and punish, but to
warn and instruct, and exhort the
Persons under our Care, to do those
things which tend most to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of our holy Religion, and the
Church whereof we are Members.
And for these Ends there are some
things I shall more particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
to you.</p>
            <p>(1.) That you would often <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider</hi>
the Solemn <hi>Charge</hi> that was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
you, and the <hi>Profession</hi> you made
of your Resolution to do your Duty
at your <hi>Ordination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I find by <hi>the Provincial Constitution</hi>
of this Church,<note place="margin">De voto &amp; vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti Redempt. Lyndw. f. 103.</note> 
               <hi>that the Bishops were
to have their solemn Profession read over
to them twice in the year,</hi> to put them

bear the similitude of a Man, but do

These <hi>Constitutions</hi> were slighted
so much, that in 9 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. the Office

what Remedy was found by this

other Orders, as <hi>Augustinians</hi> and
<hi>Carmelites,</hi> had no such general Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense.

but they were then accounted a kind
of <hi>Pastors.</hi>

Persons who had Cures of Souls, and
Legal Titles, were said to be <hi>missi à

and therefore might preach to their
own People without a <hi>special License;</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:100520:26"/>
but if any one preached in other
parts of the <hi>Diocess,</hi> or were a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in it, then he was to be examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the <hi>Diocesan,</hi> and if he were
found <hi>tam Moribus quam Scientia ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus,</hi>
he might send him to preach
to one or more Parishes, as he
thought meet; and he was to shew
his <hi>License</hi> to the <hi>Incumbent</hi> of
the Place, before he was to be
permitted to preach, under <hi>the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopal
Seal.</hi> And thus, as far as I
can find, the Matter stood as to
<hi>Preaching,</hi> before the <hi>Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After it, when the Office of <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
was reviewed and brought
nearer to the <hi>Primitive Form;</hi> and
instead of delivering the <hi>Chalice</hi> and
<hi>Patten,</hi> with these words, <hi>Accipe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testatem
offerre Deo Sacrificium,</hi> &amp;c.
the Bishop delivered the <hi>Bible</hi> with
these words, <hi>Take thou Authority to
Preach the Word of God, and to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
the Holy Sacraments in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:100520:27"/>
&amp;c. The Priests Exhortation
was made agreeable thereto, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he exhorts the Persons in the
<q>Name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
to consider the Weight and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
of the Office and Charge
they are called to; not barely to
instruct those who are already of
Christ's Flock, but to endeavour
the Salvation of those who are in
the midst of this naughty World.
And therefore he perswades and
charges them from a due regard to
Christ, who suffered for his Sheep,
and to the Church of Christ, which
is so dear to him, to omit no Labor,
Care or Diligence in instructing
and reforming those who are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to their Charge. And the
better to enable them to perform
these things, there are some Duties
especially recommended to them,
<hi>viz.</hi> Prayer, and Study of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scriptures, according to which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100520:27"/>
they are to instruct others, and
to order their own Lives, and
of those who belong to them. And
that they might the better attend
so great a Work, they are required
to forsake and set aside (as much
as they may) all worldly Cares
and Studies, and apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
wholly to this one thing,
that they may save themselves
and them that hear them.</q> After
which follows the solemn <hi>Profession,</hi>
wherein they undertake to do these
things.</p>
            <p>This is that, my Brethren, which
I earnestly desire of you, that you
would often consider. You are not
at liberty now, whether you will do
these things or not; for you are
under a most solemn Engagement
to it. You have put your Hands to
the Plough, and it is too late to think
of looking back; and you all know
the Husbandman's Work is laborious
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100520:28"/>
and painful, and continually return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
It is possible after all his Pains,
the Harvest may not answer his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation;
but yet if he neither
plows nor sows, he can expect no
Return; if he be idle and careless,
and puts off the main of his Work
to others, can he reasonably look
for the same Success? Believe it, all
our Pains are little enough to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake
the sleepy and secure Sinners,
to instruct the Ignorant, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
the Vitious, to rebuke the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane,
to convince the Erroneous, to
satisfie the Doubtful, to confirm the
Wavering, to recover the Lapsed;
and to be useful to all, according to
their several Circumstances and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.
It is not to preach a Sermon
or two in a Weeks Time to your
Parishioners, that is the main of
your Duty; that is no such diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
Task, if Men apply their minds
as they ought to do to Divine Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100520:28"/>
and do not spend their Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in useless Studies;<note place="margin">Non potest esse Pastoris excusatio, si lupus oves comedit, &amp; Pastor nescit. <hi>Extr. de Reg. Juris</hi> c. 10.</note> but the
great Difficulty lies in Watching over
your Flock, <hi>i. e.</hi> knowing their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and applying your selves
uitably to them. He that is a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to his Flock, and only visits
them now and then, can never be
said <hi>to watch over it;</hi> he may watch
over the <hi>Fleeces,</hi> but he understands
little of the State of his Flock, <hi>viz.</hi>
of the Distempers they are under,
and the Remedies proper for them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Casuists</hi> say,<note place="margin">

               <hi>That the Reason
why there is no Command for Personal
Residence in Scripture, is, because the
Nature of the Duty requires it;</hi> for if
a Person be required to do such things
which cannot be done without it,
<hi>Residence</hi> is implied. As a Pilot to
a Ship, needs no Command to be
in his Ship; for how can he do the
Office of a Pilot out of it? Let none
think to excuse themselves by saying,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100520:29"/>
               <hi>that our Church only takes them for Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,

those who have the smallest Cures
are called <hi>Pastors;</hi> and <hi>Lyndwood</hi> there
notes, that <hi>Parochialis Sacerdos dicitur
Pastor;</hi> and that not meerly by way
of Allusion, but in respect of the
Care of Souls. But we need not go
so far back. For what is it they are
admitted to? Is it not <hi>ad curam Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marum?</hi>
Did not they promise in
their Ordination, <hi>To teach the People
committed to their Care and Charge?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Casuists distinguish a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Cure of Souls. 1. <hi>In foro inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riori
tantum,</hi> and this they say is the
<hi>Parochial Cure. 2. In foro exteriori
tantum,</hi> where there is Authority to
perform Ministerial Acts, as to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend,
excommunicate, absolve, <hi>(sine
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100520:29"/>
Pastorali Curâ:)</hi> and this <hi>Archdeacons</hi>
have by Virtue of their Office. 3. <hi>In
utroque simul,</hi> where there is a special
Care, together with Jurisdiction: this
is the Bishops. And every one of
these, say they, <hi>secundum commune
Ius Canonicum,</hi> is obliged to Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<hi>i. e.</hi> by the <hi>common Law Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical;</hi>
of which more afterwards.
The Obligation is to perpetual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence,
but as it is in other positive
Duties, there may other Duties inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene,
which may take away the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
force of it; as care of Health,
necessary Business,<note place="margin">Ioh. Athon. ad Constit. Othon. <hi>f.</hi> 14.</note> publick Service of

we are to observe that no Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
can justifie a Man in point of
Conscience, unless there be <hi>a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Cause;</hi> and no Custom can be
sufficient against the natural Equity
of the Case, whereby every one is

I confess the case in Reason is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
where there is a sufficient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision

approved by those who are to take
care that Places be well supplied,
and where there is not; but yet,
this doth not take off the force of

Canonists have distinguished between
<hi>Rectories</hi> and <hi>Vicarages,</hi> as to <hi>Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

these things.<note place="margin">Can. Extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand. De Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend. &amp; Dign.</note> 1. The <hi>Canon Law</hi>
strictly obliges every one that hath a

and excepts only two Cases, when
the Living is annexed to a Prebend
or Dignity; and then he who hath
it, is to have a perpetual Vicar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted,
with a sufficient Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
2. After this Liberty obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for dignified Persons to have <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars</hi>
endowed in their Places, the
Point of <hi>Residence</hi> was strictly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined

made between <hi>Personatus</hi> and

               <note place="margin">De Praesumpt. f. 55. 2.</note> but this was still meant of a

Residence</hi> from all such <hi>Vicars,</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:100520:31"/>
altho' the Place were not above the
Value of Five Marks; which, as
appears by <hi>Lyndwood</hi> elsewhere,<note place="margin">Lyndw. f. 34. Ioh. de Athon. in Constit. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon. f. 12.</note> was
then <hi>sufficient for Maintenance and

it their Institution was declared
to be Null. But even in that case
the Gloss there saith, <hi>That they may
be some time absent for the Benefit of

their own particular Advantage.
3. The Obligation in point of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
remains the same, but <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing
with Laws</hi> may take away the
<hi>Penalty of Non-residence</hi> in some ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.<note place="margin">Ioh. de Athon. in Constit. Othon.</note>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100520:31"/>
that <hi>Rectors</hi> are as well bound to
<hi>Residence</hi> as <hi>Vicars;</hi> but these are
more strictly tied by their Oath;
and because a Vicar cannot appoint
a Vicar, but a <hi>Parson</hi> may. And
altho' that Name among some be
used as a Term of Reproach, yet in
former Ages <hi>Personatus</hi> and <hi>Dignitas</hi>
were the same thing;<note place="margin">Can. Quia nonnulli de Clericis non Resid.</note> and so used
here in <hi>England</hi> in the time of <hi>Henry</hi>
II. but afterwards it came to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to him that had the <hi>Possession</hi>
of a <hi>Parochial Benefice</hi> in his own
<hi>immediate Right;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Quadril. 1. 1. c. 5.</note> and was therefore
bound to take care of it. For the
Obligation must in Reason be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to go along with the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
however Local Statutes may
have taken off the Penalty.</p>
            <p>II. When you have thus consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Obligation which lies upon
you, to take care of your Flock, let
me in the next place recommend to
you a plain, useful, and practical
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100520:32"/>
Way of <hi>Preaching</hi> among them. I
mean such as is most likely to do
good upon them (which certainly
ought to be the just Measure of
Preaching.) I do not mean therefore
a loose and careless way of Talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Pulpit, which will neither
profit you, nor those that hear you.
He that once gets an ill Habit of
speaking <hi>extempore,</hi> will be tempted to
continue it by the Easiness of it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and the Plausibleness of it to less
judicious People. There is on the
other side, a closeness and Strength
of Reasoning, which is too elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
for common Understandings;
and there is an affected Fineness of
Expression which by no means be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the Pulpit: but it seems to be
like stroaking the Consciences of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
by Feathers dipt in Oil. And
there is a way of putting <hi>Scripture-Phrases</hi>
together without the Sense of
them, which those are the most apt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100520:32"/>
to admire, who understand them
least: But for those who have not
improved their Minds by Education,
the plainest way is certainly the best
and hardest, provided, it be not flat,
and dry, and incoherent, or desul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
going from one thing to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
without pursuing any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Point home to Practice, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
it to the Consciences of the
Hearers. And give me leave to tell
you, That meer general Discourses
have commonly little Effect on the
Peoples Minds; if any thing moves
them, it is <hi>particular Application</hi> as to
such things which their Consciences
are concerned in.</p>
            <p>And here I must recommend to
you the pursuing the Design of His
<hi>Majesties Letter,</hi> which hath been
some time since communicated to
you; by it you are required to
Preach at some Times on those par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Vices which you observe to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100520:33"/>
be most prevalent in the Places you
relate to, such as <hi>Drunkenness, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Swearing, Profaning the Lord's
Day,</hi> &amp;c. If ever we hope to reform
them, you must throughly convince
them, that what they do is displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to God.</p>
            <p>And there are two sorts of Men
you are to deal with,</p>
            <p>1. Profane Scoffers at Religion.
These seldom trouble you; but if
any good be to be done upon them,
it is by plain and evident Proofs of
the Good and Evil of Moral Actions.
For, as long as they think them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
they will never regard
what you say, as to the Rewards or
Punishments of them.</p>
            <p>2. Stupid and senseless People,
whose Minds are wholly sunk into
the Affairs of the World, <hi>buying and
selling and getting Gain.</hi> It is a very
hard thing to get a Thought into
them above these Matters. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100520:33"/>
you talk of meer Religion, and
another Life, is like <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> to
them; they understand you not, and
take no care to do it: but if you
can convince them, that they live in
the Practice of great Sins, which they
shall certainly suffer for, if they do
not Repent, they may possibly be
awakened this way; if not, nothing
but immediate Grace can work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them; which must work on the
Will, whatever becomes of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</p>
            <p>III. After preaching, let me intreat
you to look after <hi>Catechizing</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing
the Youth of your Parishes.
He that would reform the World to
purpose, must begin with the Youth;
and train them up betimes, in the
Ways of Religion and Virtue. There
is far less probability of prevailing
on those who have accustomed
themselves to vicious Habits, and are
hardened in their Wickedness. It
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100520:34"/>
seems strange to some, that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the shortness of Human Life,
Mankind should be so long before
they come to Maturity; the best Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
I know of it, is, that there is
so much longer time for the Care
of their Education, to instill the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Virtue and Religion into
them, thereby to soften the Fierceness,
to direct the Weakness, to govern
the Inclinations of Mankind. It is
truly a sad Consideration, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Parents are so little sensible
of their Duties, as to the Education
of their Children; when those who
have had only natural Reason to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
them, have laid so much Weight
upon it.<note place="margin">Plato de Leg. <hi>l.</hi> 6.</note> 
               <hi>Without it, Plato</hi> saith, <hi>that

Virtue,</hi> saith he, <hi>is a great thing, yea,
it is all in all, and without it they will be
much worse than Beasts.</hi> The main
Care of the Education of Children
must lie upon Parents; but yet Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
ought not only to put them
in mind of their Duty, but to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
them all they can, and by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Catechizing, frequently to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
both those who have not learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and those who are ashamed to
learn any other way. And you must
use the best means you can to bring
them into an Esteem of it; which is
by letting them see, that you do it,
not meerly because you are required
to do it, but because it is a thing so
useful and beneficial to them, and to
their Children. There is a great deal
of difference between Peoples being
able to talk over a Set of <hi>Phrases,</hi>
about Religious Matters, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the true Grounds of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
which are easiest learned, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100520:35"/>
understood, and remembred in the
short Catechetical Way. But I am
truly sorry to hear, that where the
<hi>Clergy</hi> are willing to take pains this
way, the People are unwilling to
send their Children. They would
not be unwilling to hear them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,
as early as might be, in
the way to get an Estate, but would
be very thankful to those who would
do them such a kindness; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is really a Contempt of God
and Religion, and another World,
which makes them so backward to
have their Children taught the Way
to it. And methinks those who have
any Zeal for the <hi>Reformation,</hi> should
love and pursue that which came into
<hi>Request</hi> with it. Indeed the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> it self hath been made so
sensible of the Necessity of it, that
even the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> doth not

and it was that which brought in
the Reformation, since which a just
Care hath still been required for the
Instruction of Youth; and the Fifty

strict in it, which I desire you often

such Persons in your Parish, as you
shall think fit to be presented to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop

come unprepared for so great, so
solemn a thing, <hi>as renewing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
and Vow made in Baptism,</hi> can
you think your selves free from any
Guilt in it? In the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
indeed great care was taken to hasten
Confirmation of Children all they
could:<note place="margin">Provine. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stit.</note>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100520:37"/>
required? None that I can find:
But great care is taken about the <hi>Fillets

               <note place="margin">Lyndw. f. 19.</note> as <hi>Lyndwood</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
us. But we have no such Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms,
nor any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Reformed
Churches: We depend not upon the
<hi>Opus operatum,</hi> but suppose a due
and serious preparation of Mind ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
and a solemn Performance
of it. I hope, by God's Assistance,
to be able, in time, to bring the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of this Office into a better
Method; in the mean time I shall
not fail doing my Duty; have you
a care you do not fail in yours.</p>
            <p>V. As to the <hi>Publick Offices</hi> of the
<hi>Church,</hi> I do not only recommend
to you a due Care of the <hi>Diligent,</hi>
but of the <hi>Devout</hi> Performance of
them. I have often wondred how
a fixed and stated Liturgy for gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100520:38"/>
Use, should become a matter of
Scruple and Dispute among any in
a Christian Church, unless there be
something in Christianity which makes
it unlawful to pray together for things
which we all understand beforehand to
be the Subject of our Prayers. If
our common Necessities and Duties
are the same; if we have the same
Blessings to pray, and to thank God
for in our solemn Devotions, why
should any think it unlawful or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting
to use the same Expressions?
Is God pleased with the change of
our Words and Phrases? Can we
imagine the Holy Spirit is given to
dictate new Expressions in Prayers?
Then they must pray by immediate
Inspiration (which I think they will
not pretend to, lest all the Mistakes
and Incongruities of such Prayers be
imputed to the Holy Ghost) but if
not, then they are left to their own
Conceptions, and the Spirits Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100520:38"/>
is only in the exciting the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and Motions of the Soul to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the things prayed for; and if
this be allowed, it is impossible to
give a Reason why the Spirit of God
may not as well excite those inward
Desires, when the Words are the same
as when they are different. And we
are certain, that from the Apostles
times downwards, no one Church
or Society of Christians can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
who held it unlawful to pray
by a Set-Form. On the other side,
we have very early Proofs of some
common Forms of Prayer, which
were generally used in the Christian
Churches, and were the Foundations
of those <hi>Ancient Liturgies,</hi> which, by
degrees were much enlarged. And
the Interpolations of later times, do
no more overthrow the Antiquity of
the Ground-work of them, than the
large Additions to a Building, do
prove there was no House before. It
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100520:39"/>
is an easie matter to say, that such
Liturgies could not be St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s or
St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s, because of such Errors and
Mistakes, and Interpolations of
Things and Phrases of later times;
but what then? Is this an Argument
there were no Ancient Liturgies in
the Churches of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi>
when so long since, as in <hi>Origen</hi>'s
time we find an entire Collect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by him out of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi>
Liturgy?<note place="margin">Orig. in Iur. H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> And the like may be shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as to other Churches, which by
degrees came to have their Liturgies
much enlarged by the devout Prayers
of some extraordinary Men, such
as S. <hi>Basil</hi> and S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> in the
Eastern Churches.</p>
            <p>But my Design is not to vindicate
our use of an excellent Liturgy, but
to put you upon the using it in such
manner, as may most recommend
it to the People. I mean with that
Gravity, Seriousness, Attention, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100520:39"/>
Devotion, which becomes so solemn
a Duty as Prayer to God is. It will
give too just a cause of prejudice to
our Prayers, if the People observe
you to be careless and negligent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them; or to run them over
with so great haste, as if you mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
nothing so much as to get to the
end of them. If you mind them so
little your selves, they will think
themselves excused, if they mind
them less. I could heartily wish, that
in greater places, especially in such
Towns where there are People more
at liberty, the constant Morning and
Evening Prayers were duly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly
read; as it is already done
with good Success in <hi>London,</hi> and
some other Cities. By this means
Religion will gain ground, when the
publick Offices are daily performed;
and the people will be more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with Scripture, in hearing
the Lessons, and have a better esteem
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100520:40"/>
of the Prayers, when they become
their daily Service, which they offer
up to God as their Morning and
Evening Sacrifice; and the Design
of our Church will be best answered,
which appoints <hi>the Order for Morning
and Evening Prayer daily to be said, and
used throughout the Year.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VI. As to the <hi>Dissenters</hi> from the
Church; the present Circumstances
of our Affairs require a more than
ordinary <hi>Prudence</hi> in your Behaviour
towards them. It is to no purpose to
provoke or exasperate them, since
they will be but so much more your
Enemies for it; and if you seem to
court them too much, they will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
your Kindness to be a liking
their Way better than your own; so
that were it not for some worldly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
you would be just what they
are; which is in effect to say, you
would be Men of Conscience, if ye
had a little more Honesty. For they
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100520:40"/>
can never think those honest Men,
who comply with things against their
Consciences, only for their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Advantage; but they may like
them as Men of a Party, who under
some specious Colours, promote their
Interest. For my own part, as I do
sincerely value and esteem the Church
of <hi>England</hi> (and I hope ever shall)
so I am not against such a due tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
towards them, as is consistent
with the preserving the Constitution
of our Church. But if any think,
under a pretence of Liberty, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine
and destroy it, we have
Reason to take the best care we can,
in order to its preservation. I do not
mean by opposing Laws, or affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Authority, but by countermining
them in the best way, <hi>i.e.</hi> by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing
them in those things which
make them most popular, if they
are consistent with Integrity and a
good Conscience. If they gain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100520:41"/>
the People by an Appearance of
more than ordinary Zeal for the
good of Souls, I would have you to
go beyond them in a true and hearty
Concernment for them; not in irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Heats and Passions, but in the
<hi>Meekness of Wisdom,</hi> in a calm and
sedate Temper; in doing good even to
them who most despitefully reproach
you, and withdraw themselves and
the People from you. If they get an
Interest among them by Industry,
and going from Place to Place, and
Family to Family; I hope you will
think it your Duty to converse more
freely and familiarly with your own
People. Be not <hi>Strangers,</hi> and you
will make them <hi>Friends.</hi> Let them
see by your particular Application
to them, that you do not despise
them. For Men love to value those
who seem to value them; and if you
once slight them, you run the hazard
of making them your Enemies. It is
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100520:41"/>
some Trial of a Christians <hi>Patience,</hi>
as well as <hi>Humility,</hi> to condescend to
the Weaknesses of others; but where
it is our Duty, we must do it, and
that chearfully, in order to the best
End, <hi>viz.</hi> doing the more good upon
them. And all Condescension and
Kindness for such an End, is true
<hi>Wisdom</hi> as well as <hi>Humility.</hi> I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
Distance and too great Stiffness
of Behaviour towards them, have
made some more our Enemies than
they would have been. I hope they
are now convinced, that the Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
which they complained lately
so much of, was carried on by other
Men, and for other Designs than
they would then seem to believe. But
that Persecution was then a popular
Argument for them; for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
side hath always the most
Pity. But now that is taken off, you
may deal with them on more equal
Terms. Now there is nothing to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100520:42"/>
them, and we think we have
Reason enough on our side to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
them. The Case of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
stands just as it did in Point of
Conscience, which is not now one
jot more reasonable or just than it
was before. Some think Severity
makes Men consider; but I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
it heats them too much, and
makes them too violent and refracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
You have more Reason to fear
now, what the Interest of a Party will
do, than any Strength of Argument.
How very few among them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
any Reason at all for their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration!
But Education, Prejudice,
Authority of their Teachers sway
them; remove these, and you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
them. And in order thereto,
acquaint your selves with them, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to oblige them, let them see
you have no other Design upon them,
but to do them good; if any thing
will gain upon them, this will.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:100520:42"/>
But if after all, they grow more
headstrong and insolent by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
which the Law gives them;
then observe, whether they observe
those Conditions on which the Law
gives it to them. For these are known
Rules in Law,<note place="margin">11. Q. 3. c. 63. Lyndw. ad L. de Poenis. f. 161.</note> 
               <hi>That he forfeits his
Privilege who goes beyond the Bounds
of it;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Extr. de Priv. c. Porro in Gloss.</note> 
               <hi>That no Privileges are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
beyond the Bounds which the Laws
give them; for they ought to be observed
as they are given.</hi> I leave it to be
considered, whether all such who do
not observe the Conditions of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,
be not as liable to the Law,
as if they had none.</p>
            <p>But there is a very profane Abuse
of this Liberty among some, as tho'
it were an Indulgence not to
serve God at all. Such as these, as
they were never intended by the Law,
so they ought to enjoy no Benefit
by it: For this were to countenance
Profaneness and Irreligion, which I
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100520:43"/>
am afraid, will grow too much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, unless some effectual Care be
taken to suppress it.</p>
            <p>VII. There is another Duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
upon you, which I must
particularly recommend to your
Care, and that is, of <hi>Visiting the Sick.</hi>
I do not mean barely to perform
the Office prescribed, which is of
very good Use, and ought not to be
neglected; but a particular Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of your selves to the State and
Condition of the Persons you visit.
It is no hard matter to run over some
Prayers, and so take leave; but this
doth not come up to the Design of
our Church in that Office: For, after
the general Exhoratation and Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Christian Faith, our
Church requires, That <hi>the sick Person
be moved to make special Confession of
his Sins, if he feel his Conscience trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with any weighty matter;</hi> and then
<hi>if the sick Person humbly and heartily
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100520:43"/>
desires it,</hi> he is to be <hi>absolved</hi> after this
manner, <hi>Our Lord Iesus Christ, who
hath left Power in his Church to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
all Sinners who truly repent and
believe in him,</hi> &amp;c. Where the power
of Absolution is grounded upon the
Supposition of true Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
and therefore when it is said
afterwards, <hi>And by his Authority com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to me, I absolve thee from the
same,</hi> &amp;c. it must proceed on the same
Supposition. For the Church cannot
absolve when God doth not. So that
all the real Comfort of the Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
depends upon the Satisfaction of
the person's Mind, as to the Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his Repentance and Faith in
Christ. Now here lies the great Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
of this Office; how to give
your selves and the wounded Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
Satisfaction, as to the Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of those Acts; I do not mean
as to the Sincerity of his present
Thoughts, but as to the Acceptable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100520:44"/>
of his Faith and Repentance with
God, in order to Remission of Sins.
But what if you find the Persons so
ignorant, as not to understand what
Faith and Repentance mean? What
if they have led such careless and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
lives in this World, as hardly
ever to have had one serious Thought
of another? Is nothing to be done
but to come and pray by them, and
so dismiss them into their Eternal
State? Is this all the good you can,
or are bound to do them? I confess
it is a very uncomfortable thing to
tell Men how they are to begin to
live, when they are liker to die than
to live (and the People generally
have a strange superstitious Fear of
sending for the Minister, while there
is any hope of Recovery.) But at
last you are sent for; and what a
melancholy Work are you then to
go about? You are, it may be, to
make a Man sensible of his Sins, who
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100520:44"/>
never before considered what they
were, or against whom they were
committed, or what eternal Misery
he deserves by committing them.
But I will suppose the best I can in
this Case, <hi>viz.</hi> That by your warm
and serious Discourse, you throughly
awaken the Conscience of a long and
habitual Sinner; what are you then
to do? Will you presently apply all
the Promises of Grace and Salvation
to one whose Conscience is awakened
only with the Fears of Death, and
the Terrors of a Day of Judgment?
This, I confess, is a hard Case; on
the one side, we must not discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
good Beginnings in any; we
must not cast an awakened Sinner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Despair; we must not limit the
infinite Mercy of God: But on the
other side, we must have a great
care of incouraging presumptuous
Sinners to put off their Repentance
to the last, because then upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100520:45"/>
of their Sins, they can so easily
obtain the Churches Absolution,
which goes no farther, than <hi>truly
Repenting and Believing.</hi> But here is
the difficulty, how we can satisfie our
selves that these do <hi>truly Repent and
Believe,</hi> who are out of a Capacity
of giving Proof of their Sincerity by
Amendment of Life? I do not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
the Sincerity of their present
Purposes; but how often do we find
those to come to nothing, when they
recover and fall into the former
Temptations? How then shall they
know their own Sincerity till it be
tried? How can it be tried, when
they are going out of the State of
Trial? The most we can do, is to
encourage them to do the best they
can in their present Condition, and
to shew as many of the Fruits of true
Repentance as their Circumstances
will allow; and with the greatest
Humility of Mind, and most earnest
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100520:45"/>
Supplications to implore the infinite
Mercy of God to their Souls. But
besides these, there are many Cases
of sick Persons, which require very
particular Advice, and Spiritual Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
which you ought to be able
to give them, and it cannot be done
without some good Measure of Skill
and Experience in casuistical Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
As, How to satisfie a doubting
Conscience, as to its own Sincerity,
when so many Infirmities are mixed
with our best Actions? How a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
who hath relapsed after Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
can be satisfied of the Truth
of his Repentance, when he doth not
know, but he may farther relapse up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
fresh Temptations? How he shall
know what Failings are consistent
with the State of Grace, and the Hopes
of Heaven, and what not? What
Measure of Conviction and Power of
Resistance is necessary to make Sins
to be wilful and presumptuous? What
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100520:46"/>
the just Measures of Restitution are
in order to true Repentance, in all
such Injuries which are capable of it?
I might name many others, but these
I only mention to shew how neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
it is for you to apply your selves
to <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Casuistical Divinity,</hi> and
not to content your selves barely
with the Knowledge of what is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Positive</hi> and <hi>Controversial.</hi> I am
afraid there are too many who think
they need to look after no more
than what qualifies them for the
Pulpit; (and I wish all did take suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
care of that) but if we would
do our Duty as we ought, we must
inquire into, and be able to resolve
Cases of Conscience. For <hi>the Priests
Lips should keep</hi> this kind of <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
and the People should seek the
Law at his Mouth; for he is the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of the Lord of hosts,</hi> Mal. 2. 7. If
this held in the Levitical Priesthood,
much more certainly under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100520:46"/>
where the Rates and Measures
of our Duties are not to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by Levitical Precepts, but by
the general Reason and Nature of
Moral Actions.</p>
            <p>VIII. Among the Duties of <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Worship,</hi> I must put you in mind
of a <hi>Frequent Celebration of the Lord's
Supper.</hi> There is generally too great
a Neglect of this, which is the most
proper part of <hi>Evangelical Worship.</hi>
The Duties of <hi>Prayers and Praises,</hi>
are excellent and becoming Duties,
as we are Creatures with respect to
our Maker and Preserver. The Duty
of hearing the Word of God read
and explained, is consequent upon
our owning it to be the Rule of our
Faith and Manners; and all who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to understand and practise their
Duty, can never despise or neglect
it. But that solemn Act of Worship
wherein we do most shew our selves
Christians, is the celebrating the <hi>Holy
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100520:47"/>
Eucharist.</hi> For, therein we own and
declare <hi>the infinite Love of God in send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Son into the World to die for
Sinners, in order to their Salvation;
and that this is not only a true Saying,
but worthy of all Men to be credited.</hi>
Therein, <hi>we lift up our Hearts, and
give Thanks to our Lord God; we joyn
with Angels and Archangels in lauding
and magnifying his glorious Name.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
we not only commemorate the
Death and Sufferings of our Lord,
but are made Partakers of his Body
and Blood, after a Real, but Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Manner. Therein <hi>we offer up
our selves to God, to be a Reasonable,
Holy and Lively Sacrifice unto him.</hi>
Therein we Adore and Glorifie the
ever Blessed Trinity; and humbly
implore the Grace and Assistance of
our ever Blessed Mediator. And
what now is there in all this, which
is not very agreeable to the Faith,
Hope and Charity of Christians?
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100520:47"/>
Nay, what Duty is there, which so
much expresses all these together, as
this doth? Nor, whereby we may
more reasonably expect greater Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
of Divine Grace to be bestowed
upon us? What then makes so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to be so backward in this Duty,
which profess a Zeal and Forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in many others? If we had that
Warmth and Fervor of Devotion,
that Love to Christ, and to each
other, which the primitive Christians
had, we should make it as constant
a part of our publick Worship, as
they did; but this is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.
Neither did it always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in the Primitive Church, when
Liberty, and Ease, and worldly Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
made Persons grow more
remiss and careless in the solemn Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of their Religion.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> takes notice in his
time of the different Behaviour of
Persons,<note place="margin">In <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> 17. In Ephes. Hem. 3.</note> with respect to the holy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100520:48"/>
There were some who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to greater Holiness and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
of Life than others, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
from the common Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Mankind, and so by degrees
from joining in the Acts of publick
Worship with them. Which did
unspeakable Mischief to Christianity;
for then the Perfection of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Life, was not supposed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in the Active Part of it, but in
Retirement and Contemplation. As
tho' our highest Imitation of Christ
lay in <hi>following him into the Wilderness
to be tempted of the Devil; and not in
walking as he walked,</hi> who frequented
<hi>the Synagogues, and went about doing
good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this way of Retirement hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
to be admired by some great
Men, the Publick Worship came to
be in less esteem; and others upon
Reasons of a different Nature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
themselves from such Acts of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100520:48"/>
Devotion as required a stricter At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance,
and a more prepared Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of Mind. And there were some
who did abstain, because they were
not so well satisfied with themselves
as to their own Preparations; and
such as these S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> seems to
favour, rather than such who came
often without due care, as to the
whole Course of their Lives; only
out of custom, or out of regard to
the Orders of the Church. From
hence many thought it better to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear,
as long as they did it not out of
Contempt. And so by degrees the
People were content to look on it as
a Sacrifice for them to be performed
by others, rather than as an Office,
wherein they were to bear a part
themselves; at least, they thought
once or thrice a Year sufficient for
them. And to this, as appears by
our old <hi>Provincial Constitutions,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Concil. Angl. Tom. 2. p. 144, 166, 299.</note> they
were forced by severe <hi>Canons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:100520:49"/>
When the Reformation began, this
Disuse of this holy Sacrament was
looked on, by the chief Reformers,
as a great Abuse and Corruption
crept into the Church, which ought
by all means to be reformed; and
the frequent Celebration of it set up
in the Reformed Churches.<note place="margin">Calvin. Instit. l. 4. c. 17. n. 44. Pet. Martyr. L. C. l. 4. c. 10. n. 48.</note> But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
Scruples in some, and
Misapprehensions in others, and a
general Coldness and Indifference,<note place="margin">In 1 Cor. 11. p. 55.</note> as
to Matters of Religion,<note place="margin">Bucer in Matth. 16. p. 186.</note> have hitherto
hindered the Reviving this Primitive
Part of Devotion among us.</p>
            <p>I do not go about to determine
the Frequency in your Parishes, which
the Scripture doth not as to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church, but supposes it to be
<hi>often done;</hi> but I may require you
to take care that Christ's Institution
be observed among you; and that
with your utmost care, both as to
the Decency and Purity of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:100520:49"/>
The last thing I recommend to
you all, is, <hi>To have a great care of your
Conversations.</hi> I do not speak it out
of a distrust of you; I hope you do
it already: and your Case will be
so much worse, if you do it not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you very well know how much
you ought to do it. For the Honour
of God and Religion, and the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of your Ministry, as well as your
own Salvation, depend very much
upon it. Lead your Flock by your
Example, as well as by your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and then you may much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hope that they will follow you;
for the People are naturally <hi>Spies</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their <hi>Ministers,</hi> and if they observe
them to mind nothing but the World
all the Week, they will not believe
them in earnest, when on the Lords
Days they perswade them against it.
And it takes off the Weight of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof
of other Mens Faults, if those
they reprove have reason to believe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100520:50"/>
them guilty of the same. I do not
think it enough for <hi>a Preacher of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi>
merely to avoid open and
scandalous Sins, but he ought to be
a great Example to others in the most
excellent Virtues which adorn our
Profession, not only in <hi>Temperance
and Chastity,</hi> in <hi>Iustice and ordinary
Charity,</hi> but in a readiness to do good
to all, in forgiving Injuries, in loving
Enemies, in evenness of Temper, in
Humility and Meekness, and Patience,
and Submission to God's Will, and
in frequent Retirements from the
World, not meerly for Study, but
for Devotion. If by these and such
things you <hi>shine as Lights</hi> among
your People, they will be more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to follow your Conduct; and in
probability you will not only stop
their Mouths, but gain their Hearts.
For among all the Ways of advancing
the Credit and Interest of the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> one of the most succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100520:50"/>
will be the diligent Labours, and
the exemplary Lives of the Clergy
in it.</p>
            <p>But if Men will not regard their
own, or the Churches Interest in this
matter; if they will break their Rules
in such a manner, as to dishonour
God, and the Church, and themselves
by it; then you are to consider the next
thing I was to speak to, which is,</p>
            <p>II. What <hi>Authority</hi> is given to us
for the punishing <hi>Offenders</hi> in our
<hi>Diocesses</hi> by the <hi>Ecclesiastical Law</hi> of
this Realm. For this we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
That our <hi>Authority</hi> herein is
not derived from any modern <hi>Canons</hi>
or <hi>Constitutions</hi> of this <hi>Church</hi> (altho'
due Regard ought to be shewed to
them) but from the ancient <hi>Common
Law Ecclesiastical</hi> in this Realm, which
still continues in force. For as there
is a <hi>Common Law</hi> with respect to <hi>Civil
Rights,</hi> which depends not on the
<hi>Feudal Constitutions,</hi> altho' in many
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100520:51"/>
things it be the same with them; but
upon <hi>ancient Practice, and general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi>
of the People from Age to Age.
So, I say, there is a <hi>Common Law Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical,</hi>
which altho' in many
things it may be the same with the
<hi>Canon Law,</hi> which is read in the Books;
yet it hath not its force from any
<hi>Papal</hi> or <hi>Legatine Constitutions,</hi> but
from the <hi>Acceptance and Practice</hi> of it
in our Church. I could easily shew
(if the time would permit) that <hi>Papal
and Legatine Constitutions</hi> were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
here, altho' directed hither;
that some <hi>Provincial Constitutions</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
obtained the Force of <hi>Ecclesiastical
Laws;</hi>
               <note place="margin">I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t. 632.</note> but my business is to shew
what did obtain and continue still to
have the Force of such <hi>Ecclesiastical
Laws</hi> among us.</p>
            <p>By the <hi>Statute</hi> of 25 <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 19.
it is declared, <q>That such Canons,
Constitutions, Ordinances, and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodals
Provincial being already
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100520:51"/>
made, which be not contrariant
nor repugnant to the Laws, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
and Customs of this Realm,
nor to the Damage or Hurt to the
King's Prerogative Royal, shall
now still be used and executed as
they were afore the making of this
Act, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> It's true, a <hi>Review</hi> was
appointed, but such Difficulties were
found in it, as to the shaking the
Foundations of the <hi>Ecclesiastical Law</hi>
here, that nothing was ever legally
established in it; and therefore this
Law is still in force.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Statute 25 H. 8. c.</hi> 21. it is
said, <q>That this Realm Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
no Superiour under God but
the King, hath been, and is free
from Subjection to any Man's
Laws, but only to such as have
been Devised, Made, and Observed
within this Realm, for the Wealth
of the same: or to such other, as by
the Sufferance of the King and his
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100520:52"/>
Progenitors, the People of this
Realm have taken at their free Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
by their own Consent, to
be used amongst them, and have
bound themselves by long Use and
Custom to Observance of the same,
not as to the Observance of the
Laws of any Foreign Prince, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate,
or Prelate, but as to the
Customs and ancient Laws of this
Realm, originally established, as
Laws of the same by the said
Sufferance, Consent, Custom, and
none otherwise.</q>
            </p>
            <p>All that I have now to do; is to
shew what <hi>Authority</hi> the <hi>Bishops</hi> had
over the <hi>Clergy</hi> by the Ancient <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Law</hi> of this Realm; and what
<hi>Censu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es</hi> they were liable to for some
particular Offences.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>By the</hi> Ecclesiastical Law <hi>the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
is</hi> Iudge <hi>of the</hi> Fitness <hi>of any</hi>
Clerk <hi>presented to a</hi> Benefice. <hi>This is
confessed by the Lord</hi> Coke <hi>in these
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100520:52"/>
Words:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Inst. 632.</note> And the Examination of the
Ability and Sufficiency of the Person pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,
belongs to the Bishop, who is the
Ecclesiastical Iudge, and in the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
he is a Iudge, and not a Minister,
and may and ought to refuse the Person
presented, if he be not <hi>Persona idonea.
But this is plain to have been the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi>
Ecclesiastical <hi>Law of this Realm,
by the</hi> Articul. Cleri <hi>in</hi> Edw. II. <hi>time,</hi>

            <p>By the <hi>Provincial Constitutions</hi> at
<hi>Oxford</hi> in the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> III.<note place="margin">Provinc. Cons. quum secund. f. 71.</note> the
Bishop is required to admit the Clerk
who is presented, without Oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

much time is allowed, <hi>propter Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minationem,</hi>
saith <hi>Lyndwood;</hi> even
when there is no Dispute about
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100520:53"/>
Right of Patronage. The main thing
he is to be examined upon, is <hi>his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
to discharge his Pastoral Duty,</hi> as
<hi>Coke</hi> calls it; or as <hi>Lyndwood</hi> saith,
whether he be <hi>commendandus Scientia
&amp; Moribus.</hi> As to the former, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
may judge himself; but as to
the latter, he must take the <hi>Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials</hi>
of others; and I heartily wish
the Clergy would be more careful in
giving them, by looking on it as a
Matter of <hi>Conscience,</hi> and not meerly
of <hi>Civility;</hi> for otherwise it will be
impossible to avoid the pestering the
Church with scandalous and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Wretches. If the Bishop refuses
to admit within the time (which
by the Modern Canons is limited to
Twenty eight Days after the Presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
delivered) he is liable to a
<hi>Duplex Querela</hi> in the Ecclesiastical
Courts,<note place="margin">Can. 95.</note> and a <hi>Quare impedit</hi> at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law; and then he must certifie
the Reasons of his Refusal. In <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot</hi>'s

               <hi>that the
Bishop is Iudge in the Examination, and
therefore the Law giveth Faith and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to his Iudgment.</hi> But because
great Inconveniencies might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
happen, the general Allegation
is not sufficient, but he must certifie
<hi>specially</hi> and <hi>directly;</hi> and the general
Rule is, and it was so resolved by
the Judges, <hi>That all such as are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Causes of Deprivation of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent,
are sufficient Causes to refuse

of <hi>Othobon,</hi> the Bishop is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
particularly to enquire into
the Life and Conversation of him
that is presented; and afterwards,
that if a Bishop admits another who

he rejected the former,<note place="margin">C. Christiano, f. 63.</note> his Institution
is declared null and void.<note place="margin">De Iure Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron. c. Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis Officii.</note> By the
Canon Law, if a Bishop maliciously

refuses to admit a fit Person, he is
bound to provide another Benefice

much better puts him upon the Proof
of the Cause of his Refusal. But if

the Bishop is not barely to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine

Orders. How can he be satisfied,
unless the other produce them? How
can he produce them, when it may

express, <hi>That no Bishop shall institute

he Ordained him himself, he cannot

shall appear upon due Examination to

<hi>Palmes</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Peterbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi>'s
Case, it was adjudged, That
no Lapse did accrue by the Clerk's
not shewing his Orders, for the Bishop
upon his not coming to him again,
collated after six Months. But the
Court agreed,<note place="margin">3 Cr. 341. 1 Leon. 230.</note> That the Clerk ought
to make Proof of his Orders; but
they differed about the manner of
their Proof. <hi>Anderson</hi> said, The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
might give him his Oath. But
if a Proof were necessary, and the
Clerk did not come to make Proof,
it seems to me to be a very hard

Canons I can find, the Bishops Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation
is supposed as a thing implied
in his Office; whereby he is obliged
to look after the good Estate of his
whole Diocess, and especially of the
Clergy in it.<note place="margin">Concil. Anglic. vol. 2. f. 124.</note> In the time of <hi>Hubert</hi>
Arehbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of King <hi>Iohn</hi>'s time, Care is
taken in the Canons then made, <hi>That
B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>shops should not be burdensom to the
Clergy in the Number of the Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
in their Visitations, which then
were Parochial, and the Number allowed
of Twenty or Thirty Horse, was too
heavy for the Clergy to bear.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by degrees it was thought fit
to turn that Charge into a Certainty,
which was the Original of <hi>Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
By the Fourth Council of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo,</hi>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:100520:55"/>
the Bishop was to visit his whole
Diocess,<note place="margin">c. 10. q. 1. Episcopum, Regino. l. 1. c. 7.</note> Parochially, every Year.
The Gloss saith, <hi>if there were occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for it; and that the Bishop may
visit as often as he sees cause; but if
he be hindered,</hi> the Canon saith, <hi>he
may send others</hi> (which is the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
of the <hi>Arch-Deacon's Visitation)
to see not only the Condition of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
but the Lives of the Ministers.</hi>
The Council of <hi>Braga</hi> in the latter
end of the Sixth Century,<note place="margin">Concil. Braga. 2. c. 1. 10. q. 1. Placait.</note> makes this
the first Canon, That all Bishops
should visit their Diocesses by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,
and there should first examine
the Clergy, and then the People;
and in another Canon he was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to receive only his <hi>Cathedraticum,
i. e.</hi> a certain Sum in lieu of Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment;
which came to be setled
by Prescription. The Council of
<hi>Cavailon</hi> in <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Concil. Cabil. 2. c. 14.</note> 
               <hi>A. D.</hi> 831. fixed
no Sum, but desired the Bishops to
be no Burdens to the Clergy in their
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100520:56"/>
parochial Visitations. <hi>Lyndwood</hi> saith,
the Ancient <hi>Procuration</hi> here, was <hi>a
Day and Nights Entertainment;</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Censibus, f. 121.</note> which
after came to be a customary Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:<note place="margin">De Officio Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carii c. quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam V. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curari.</note>
But however it was paid, it is
an evident Proof of the Right of the
Bishops Visitations by the Ancient
Ecclesiastical Law; and by such a
Custom as is allowable by the Rules
of our Common Law.</p>
            <p>III. There are some Faults which
make the Clergy liable to Depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Virtue of the Ecclesiastical
Law, which was here received. I shall
name only some of them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude;
these being sufficient for my
present purpose.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>Excessive Drinking.</hi> All drinking
<hi>(ad Potus aequales)</hi> was absolutely
forbidden to Clergymen,<note place="margin">Concil. Anglic. vol. 2. 140, 200.</note> on pain of
<hi>Suspension</hi> after <hi>Admonition;</hi> not only
by a <hi>Synodical,</hi> but by a <hi>Provincial
Constitution</hi> under <hi>Edmund,</hi> Archbishop
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100520:56"/>
of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> The <hi>Canon Law</hi> saith
in that case, <hi>ab Officio vel Beneficio
suspendatur:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Extr. de Vita &amp; Honestat. Cleric. c. 14.</note> But our <hi>Constitution</hi> is
more severe, <hi>à Beneficio &amp; Officio.</hi>
The Council of <hi>Oxford</hi> not only
strictly forbids all Clergymen what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
tends to <hi>Gluttony and Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. Cont. f. 61.</note>
but it requires the Bishops to
proceed strictly against those who
are guilty, according to the Form
of the <hi>General Council,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,
4. viz.</hi> by <hi>Admonition</hi> first, and
then <hi>Suspension. Lyndwood</hi> complains,
That <hi>this was not so much looked after
as it should be, because it brought no
Profit;</hi> I hope that Reason will not
hold among those who pretend to
Reformation; which will be very
defective, if it extend not to our Lives
as well as our Doctrines: For there
can be no greater Reproach than to
see those loose and dissolute in their
Conversations, who think it their
Honour to be Ministers of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100520:57"/>
Church. It was a stinging
Reflection upon our Church by the
Archbishop of <hi>Spalato,</hi> (who was
no very strict Man himself) <hi>That he
saw nothing Reformed among us but our
Doctrines.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epist. ad Ios. Hall.</note> I hope there was more of
<hi>Satyr</hi> than of <hi>Truth</hi> in it; for I do
not question, but there were many
then (as there are now) of Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
Lives, and Unblameable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations;
but if there be any others,
it will be the more shame not to
proceed against them; since even
before the Reformation, the Canons
were so strict and severe in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
In the Council at <hi>Westminster</hi> in
<hi>Henry</hi> II. time, under <hi>Richard,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of <hi>Canterbury, all Clergymen
are forbidden going into Taverns to eat
or drink, unless upon Travelling;</hi> and
the Sanction of this Canon is, <hi>aut
cesset,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Concil. Anglic. 2 vol. 104.</note> 
               <hi>aut deponatur.</hi> The same was
forbidden in the Council at <hi>York,</hi> in

               <note place="margin">126.</note> And since the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation

               <hi>other than for their honest Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities,
resort to any Taverns or Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses.</hi>
And there have been Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Severity of our Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Censures against <hi>Drunkenness</hi> in
Clergymen.</p>
            <p>In 8 <hi>Iac. Parker</hi> was deprived of
his Benefice for Drunkenness,<note place="margin">Brownlow's Rep. f. 37.</note> and
moved for a Prohibition, but it was
denied him.</p>
            <p>In 9 <hi>Iac.</hi> another was deprived
for the same Fault; and the Judges
at Common Law allowed the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to be good.</p>
            <p>No doubt there are other Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,<note place="margin">Id. f. 70.</note>
but we had not known of these,
if they had not been preserved in
Books of Reports.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>Incontinency.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lyndw. f. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Lyndwood</hi> saith,
Those who are proved to be guilty
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100520:58"/>
of it, are <hi>ipso Iure privati;</hi> but he
thinks a Declaratory Sentence of the
Ecclesiastical Judges necessary for the
Execution of it.<note place="margin">6 C. 14. Hob. 293. Owen 87. 1 Cr. 41. 789.</note> Since the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,

that the <hi>Ecclesiastical Law</hi> is allowed
by the Judges of Common Law, to
continue in sufficient Force for <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation</hi>
in this Case.</p>
            <p>III. <hi>Simony.</hi> Which is the Name
given by the Ecclesiastical Law, to
all Contracts for Gain in the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
or obtaining any Ecclesiastical
Promotion or Ministry. It is true,
these do not come up to the very Sin
of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi>

but because the whole Ministerial Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
in all the parts of it (especially
the Cure of Souls) is of a <hi>Spiritual
Nature;</hi> and all Bargains are so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100520:58"/>
to the Design of it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Ecclesiastical Law hath fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that detestable Name upon it:
For, all <hi>Contractus non gratuiti</hi> in these
things, savour of <hi>turpe Lucrum,</hi> and
tend to bring in <hi>turpe Commercium</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church; which would really
overturn the whole Design of that
Ministry, which was designed for the
Salvation of Souls. And therefore
it was necessary, that when Persons
had received (by the Favour of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Princes and other Benefactors,
who were Founders of Churches)
such Endowments as might encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
them in their Function, that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Laws should be made against
any such sordid and mischievous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts.
And such there were here in
<hi>England</hi> long before the excellent Stat.
of 31 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 6. although it seems
the Force of them was so much worn
out, as to make that Statute necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for avoiding of <hi>Simony;</hi> which
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100520:59"/>
is there explained to be <hi>Corruption in

               <hi>in the Conqueror's time,</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<hi>was forbidden, under the
Name of</hi> Buying and selling of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.

               <note place="margin">p. 35.</note>
               <hi>But in the time of</hi> Henry <hi>I.</hi>
Ecclesiastical Benefices were forbidden
to be bought or sold, and it was De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation
then to any Clergyman to be
convicted of it; and a Layman was to
be Out-lawed, and Excommunicated,
and Deprived of his Right of Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage.
<hi>And this was done by a</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the Reign of</hi> Henry <hi>II. it was

               <hi>but two Kings were present</hi> (Hen. <hi>II.

of as little Effect as that of <hi>Othobon,</hi>

That the Ecclesiastical Law had

varied in this matter. And it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded

<hi>Alexander</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>V. That by taking a second,<note place="margin">Ex. de Praeb. c. de Multa.</note>
the first is void; which is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Canon of the Fourth <hi>Lateran</hi>
Council.</p>
            <p>VI. That if he were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with the last, but endeavour
to keep both, he should be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of both. And this was the
<hi>Ecclesiastical Law</hi> as it was declared
in our <hi>Provincial Constitutions.</hi> But
the general Practice was to avoid
the former, according to the <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi>
Council. These were very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Canons, but that one Clause
of the <hi>Pope's Dispensing Power,</hi> made
them to signifie little, unless it were
to advance his Power and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue.
For when the <hi>Dispensing Power</hi>
came to be owned, the Law had
very little Force; especially as to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100520:62"/>
the Consciences of Men. For if
it were a Law of God, how could
any man dispense with it? unless it
were as apparent that he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
a Power in some Cases to
<hi>Dispense,</hi> as that he had made the
Law. Those Casuists are very hard
put to it, who make Residence <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
Divino,</hi> and yet say the Pope
may dispense with it; which at
last comes only to this, That the
Pope can authoritatively declare the
sufficiency of the Cause: so that
the whole matter depends upon the
Cause; whether there can be any
sufficient to excuse from Personal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence.</p>
            <p>It is agreed on all hands, that the
habitual Neglect of a Charge we
have taken upon our selves, is an
evil thing, and that it is so to heap
up Preferments meerly for Riches,
or Luxury, or Ambition; but the
main Question in point of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100520:62"/>
is, What is a sufficient Cause
to justifie any Man's breaking so
reasonable and just a Rule as that of
Residence is.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied, that the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
Canons of the Church were so
strict and severe, that they made it
unlawful for any Man to go from
that Church in which he first recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Orders; as well as to take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Benefice in it: and so for any
Bishop to be translated from that
Place he was first Consecrated to;
as well as to hold another with it.
But the Good of the Church being
the main Foundation of all the
Rules of it; when that might be
better promoted by a <hi>Translation,</hi> it
was by a tacit Consent looked on,
as no unjust Violation of its Rules.
The Question then is, Whether the
Churches Benefit may not in some
Cases make the Canons against
Non-Residence as Dispensible, as
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100520:63"/>
those against <hi>Translations?</hi> And the
Resolution of it doth not depend
upon the voiding the particular
Obligation of the Incumbent to his
Cure; but upon some more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Reason with respect to the State
of the Church; as being imployed
in the Service of it, which requires
a Persons having (not a bare Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency
for Subsistence, but) a Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
to provide Necessaries for
such Service: For those seem to have
very little regard to the flourishing
Condition of a Church, who would
confine the Sufficiency of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence,
meerly to the Necessaries
of Life. But it seems to be reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
that Clergymen should have
Incouragement sufficient, not only to
keep them above Contempt, but
in some respect agreeable to the
more ample Provision of other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Men. And by God's own
Appointment the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:100520:63"/>
did not fall short of any of the rest,
if it did not very much exceed the
Proportion of others. We do not
pretend to the Privileges they had,
only we observe from thence, that
God himself did appoint a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Subsistence for those who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
upon his Service. And I
do not know what there is <hi>Levitical</hi>
or <hi>Ceremonial</hi> in that. I am sure
the Duties of the Clergy now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a greater Freedom of Mind
from the anxious Cares of the
World, than the Imployments of
the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> under the
Law. But we need not go so far
back; if the Church enjoyed all
her Revenues as entirely, as when
the severe Canons against <hi>Pluralities</hi>
were made, there would not be such
a Plea for them, as there is too
much Cause for in some Places,
from the Want of a competent Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence.
But since that time, the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100520:64"/>
Abundance of <hi>Appropriations</hi> (since
turned into <hi>Lay-Fees)</hi> hath extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lessened the Churches Revenues,
and have left us a great Number
of poor Vicarages, and Arbitrary
Cures, which would hardly have
afforded a Maintenance for the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinims</hi>
under the Law, who were
only to be <hi>Hewers of Wood, and
Drawers of Water.</hi> But this doth
not yet clear the Difficulty: For the
Question is, Whether the Subsistence
of the Clergy can lawfully be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by a <hi>Plurality of Livings?</hi>
Truly, I think this (if it be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in some Cases lawful) to be the
least desirable way of any; but in
some Circumstances it is much more
excusable than in others. As when
the Benefices are mean, when they
lie near each other, when great
care is taken to put in sufficient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
with good Allowance; when
Persons take all Opportunities to do
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100520:64"/>
their Duties themselves, and do not
live at a distance from their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
in an idle and careless manner.
But for Men to put in Curates meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to satisfie the Law, and to mind
nothing of the Duties of their Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
is a horrible Scandal to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and our Church, and that,
which if not amended, may justly
bring down the Wrath of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us. For the loosest of all the
Popish Casuists look upon this as a
very great Sin, even those who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to the Pope the highest Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing
Power in this Case.</p>
            <p>But when the great Liberty of
<hi>Dispensing</hi> had made the Ecclesiastical
Laws in great measure useless, then
it was thought fit by our Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers
to restrain and limit it by a
Statute made 21 <hi>H.</hi> VIII. wherein it
is Enacted,<q>That if any Person
or Persons having one Benefice
with Cure of Souls, being of the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100520:65"/>
yearly Value of Eight Pounds, or
above, accept, or take any other
with Cure of Souls, and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted,
and inducted in Possession
of the same, that then, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after such Possession had
thereof, the first Benefice shall be
adjudged to be void. And all
Licenses and Dispensations to the
contrary are declared to be void
and of none effect.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This, one would have thought,
had been an effectual Remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all such <hi>Pluralities and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations</hi>
to obtain them; and this,
no doubt, was the primary Design
of the Law; but then follow so
many <hi>Proviso's</hi> of Qualified Men to
get Dispensations, as take off a
great deal of the Force and Effect of
this Law. But then it ought well
to be consider'd, Whether such a
License being against the chief De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of a Law, can satisfie any Man
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100520:65"/>
in point of Conscience, where there
is not a just and sufficient Cause?
For, if the <hi>Pope's Dispensation,</hi> with
the supposed Plenitude of his Power,
could not satisfie a Man's Conscience
without an antecedent Cause, as the
Casuists resolve, much less can such
<hi>Proviso's</hi> do it.</p>
            <p>It is the general Opinion of Divines
and Lawyers,<note place="margin">Less. l. 2. c. 34. Dub. 27.</note> 
               <hi>saith</hi> Lessius, That no
Man is safe in Conscience by the Pope's
Dispensation for Pluralities, unless there
be a just cause for it.</p>
            <p>No Man can with a safe Conscience,<note place="margin">Pan. c. du. lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>saith Cardinal</hi> To-let,
secures a Man as to the Law; but
as to Conscience there must be a good
cause for it; and that is, when the
Church hath more Benefit by it, than it
would have without it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:100520:66"/>
But the Pope's <hi>Dispensing Power</hi>
went much farther in point of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
in their Opinion, than that
which is setled among us by Act of
Parliament. For it is expressed in
the Statute of 21 <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. That the
Dispensation is intended to keep Men
from <hi>incurring the Danger, Penalty,
and Forfeiture in the Statute comprised.</hi>
So that the most qualified Person can
only say, that the Law doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
him; but he can never plead
that it can satisfie him in point
of Conscience, unless there be
some Cause for it, which is of more
Moment to the Church, than a
Man's sole and constant Attendance
on a particular Cure is. But this
Statute is more favourable to the
Clergy, than the <hi>Canon Law</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in two Particulars.</p>
            <p>1. In declaring that no <hi>simple Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices,</hi>
or meer <hi>Dignities,</hi> as the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonists</hi>
call them, <hi>are comprehended
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:100520:66"/>
under the Name of Benefices, having
Cure of Souls,</hi> viz. <hi>no Deanary, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaconry,
Chancellorship, Treasurership,
Chantership, or Prebend in any Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral
or Collegiate Church, nor Parsonage
that hath a Vicar endowed, nor any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice
perpetually appropriate.</hi> But all
these before were within the reach of
the Canon Law, and a Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
was necessary for them: Which
shews, that this Law had a particular
respect to the necessary Attendance
on Parochial Cures, and looked on
other Dignities and Preferments in
the Church, as a sufficient Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to <hi>extraordinary Merit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That no notice is taken of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
under the Valuation of 8 <hi>l.</hi> which,
I suppose, is that of 20 <hi>E.</hi> 1. for that
of <hi>H.</hi> 8. was not till five years after
that Statute. But after that Valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it was to be judged according to
it, and not according to the real
Value, as the Judges declared 12 <hi>Car.</hi> I.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:100520:67"/>
in the Case of <hi>Drake</hi> and <hi>Hill.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cr. Car. f. 456.</note> Now
here was a regard had to the Poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Benefices, so far, that the
Statute doth not deprive the Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
upon taking a second Living, if
the former be under 8 <hi>l.</hi> The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
that arises from hence is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
such Persons are allowed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
such Pluralities by Law; or only
left to the Ecclesiastical Law, as it
was before?<note place="margin">C. 4. 75. Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's Case.</note> It is certain, that such
are not liable to the Penalty of this
Law; but before any Person might
be deprived by the Ecclesiastical Law
for taking a second Benefice without
Dispensation, of what Value soever
the former were; now here comes
a Statute, which enacts, That all
who take a second Benefice, having
one of 8 <hi>l.</hi> without Qualification,
shall lose his legal Title to the first;
but what if it be under? Shall he
lose it or not? Not by this Law.
But suppose the Ecclesiastical Law
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:100520:67"/>
before makes him liable to Depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
doth the Statute alter the Law
without any Words to that purpose?
The Bishop had a Power before to
deprive, where is it taken away?
The Patron had a Right to present
upon such Deprivation; how comes
he to lose it? And I take it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
That no antecedent Rights are
taken away by Implications; but
there must be express Clauses to that
purpose. So that I conclude, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Ecclesiastical Law to be still in
Force, where it is not taken away by
Statute.</p>
            <p>And thus, my Brethren, I have
laid before you the <hi>Authority</hi> and the
<hi>Rules</hi> we are to act by; I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to recommend to you,
the most useful Parts of your Duty,
and I hope you will not give me
occasion to shew what Power we have
by the Ecclesiastical Law of this
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100520:68"/>
Realm to proceed against Offenders.
Nothing will be more uneasie to me,
than to be forced to make use of
any Severity against you. And my
Hearts desire is, That we may all
sincerely and faithfully discharge the
Duties of our several Places, that the
blessing of God may be upon us all;
so that we may <hi>save our selves, and those
committed to our Charge.</hi>

            <head>OF THE
NATURE
OF THE
TRUST
Committed to the
Parochial Clergy,
At a Visitation at Worcester,

            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Brethren,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have formerly, on the like Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
discoursed to you of the
General Duties of your Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and the Obligation you are
under to perform them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:100520:69"/>
I shall now confine my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to these Two Things:</p>
            <p>I. To consider the particular Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the <hi>Trust</hi> committed to
you.</p>
            <p>II. The Obligation you are under
to your <hi>Parochial Cures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. The first is necessary to be
spoken to; for while Persons have
only so confused and cloudy Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
concerning it, they can
neither be satisfied in the Nature of
their Duties, nor in their Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of them. And there is Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
as well in setting them so high
as to make them Impracticable, as
in sinking them so low as to make,
not only themselves, but their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
Contemptible. For the World
(let us say what we will) will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
esteem Men, not meerly for a
Name and Profession, but for the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100520:69"/>
Work and Service which they do.
There is, no doubt, a Reverence and
Respect due to a Sacred Function
on its own Account; but the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Profession can never maintain its
Character among the rest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
unless they who are of it, do
promote the General Good, by act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
suitably to it. And the greater
the Character is, which any bear,
the higher will the Expectations of
others be concerning them; and if
they fail in the greatest and most
useful Duties of their Function, it
will be impossible to keep up the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
which ought to be shew'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it. We may complain as long
as we please of the Unreasonableness
of the Contempt of the Clergy in our
Days, (which is too general, and
too far spread) but the most effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Means to prevent or remove
it, is for the Clergy to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the most necessary Duties,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100520:70"/>
with Respect to the Charge and Trust
committed to them.</p>
            <p>But here arises a considerable Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
which deserves to be cleared;
<hi>viz.</hi> concerning the just <hi>Measures</hi> of
that Diligence which is required. For,
there are some who will never be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
that the Clergy do enough, let
them do what they can; and it is to
no purpose to think to satisfie them
who are resolved not to be satisfied:
But on the other side, some care not
how little they do, and the less, the
better they are pleased with them;
and others again, have raised their
Duties so high, that scarce any Man
can satisfie himself that he hath done
his Duty.</p>
            <p>It is a matter therefore of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Consequence to us, to understand,
What Rule and Measure is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
so as we may neither wilfully
neglect our Duty, nor despair of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:100520:70"/>
Here we are to consider Two
Things;</p>
            <p>1. How far the Scripture hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
it.</p>
            <p>2. What Influence the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Church is to have upon
us concerning it.</p>
            <p>1. The Scripture doth speak some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
relating to it, both in the Old
and New Testament.</p>
            <p>In the Old Testament we have
the Duties enjoyned to the Levitical
Priesthood, and the extraordinary
Commissions given to the Prophets.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Levitical Priesthood,</hi> we
can only draw some general Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
which may be of use, altho'
that Priesthood hath been long since
at an end; Christ being our High-Priest
after another Order, <hi>viz.</hi> of
<hi>Melchisedeck;</hi> and our Duty now is
to observe his Laws, and to offer that
Reasonable Service which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:100520:71"/>
But even from the <hi>Levitical Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi>
we may observe these things.</p>
            <p>1. That although the main of
their Duty of Attendance respected
the Temple and Sacrifices; yet at
other times they were bound to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
the People in the Law. For
so <hi>Moses</hi> leaves it as a special Charge
to the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 33. 10.</note> 
               <hi>to teach Iacob
his Iudgments,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Levit. 10. 11.</note> 
               <hi>and Israel his Law.</hi>
And to incourage them to do it,
they had a liberal Maintenance, far
above the Proportion of the other
Tribes. For, by Computation it
will be found, that they were not
much above the Sixtieth part of the
People; for when the other Tribes
were numbred from Twenty years
old,<note place="margin">Numb. 1. 3, 46.</note> they made <hi>six hundred thousand,
and three thousand and five hundred
and fifty.</hi> But the Children of <hi>Levi</hi>
were reckoned by themselves from a
Month old;<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 15, 39.</note> and they made but <hi>Two
and twenty thousand;</hi> so that if the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100520:71"/>
Males of the other Tribes had been
reckoned, as they were, it is agreed
by Learned Men,<note place="margin">Selden's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, <hi>p.</hi> 456.</note> who had no Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for the Clergy, that they did not
make above a fiftieth or sixtieth part;
and yet they had near a fifth of the
Profits, besides accidental Perquisites,
as to Sacrifices, and Ransoms of the
First-born. <hi>Thus,</hi> say they, <hi>God was
pleased to enrich that Tribe which was
devoted to his Service.</hi> But it was not
certainly, that they should spend their
time in Idleness and Luxury, but that
they might with the greater freedom
apply themselves to the Study of the
Law, that they might instruct the
People. For the Cities of the <hi>Levites</hi>
were as so many Colleges dispersed
up and down in the several Tribes,
to which the People might upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
more easily resort.</p>
            <p>2. That if the People erred thro'
Ignorance of the Law, God himself
laid the Blame on those who were
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100520:72"/>
bound to instruct them. <hi>My People,</hi>
saith God by the Prophet,<note place="margin">Hosea 4. 6.</note> 
               <hi>are destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for lack of Knowledge.</hi> If People
are resolved to be ignorant, who can
help it? Had they not the Law to
inform them? But it is observable,
that the Peoples Errors are laid to
the Charge of the Priests, and the
Punishment is denounced against
them. <hi>Because thou hast rejected Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
I will also reject thee, that thou
shalt be no Priest unto me.</hi> It seems
the Priests were grown careless and
negligent, as to their own Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
they did not know to what
purpose they should take so much
pains in studying the Law, and the
difficult Points of it; they were for
a freedom of Conversation, and
hoped to keep up their Interest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the People that Way. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Isaiah</hi> call them <hi>Shepherds that
cannot understand;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 56. 11.</note> but were very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
upon their Profits, <hi>they all look
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:100520:72"/>
to their own Way, every one for his
Gain from his Quarter.</hi> But this was
not all, for the Prophet charges them
with a Voluptuous, Careless, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Life. <hi>Come ye, say they, I will
fetch Wine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">12.</note> 
               <hi>and we will fill our selves
with strong Drink, and to morrow shall
be as this day, and much more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.</hi>
Was not this a very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
life for those who were to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
the People in the Duties of
Sobriety and Temperance? It was
Death for the Priests by the Law <hi>to
drink Wine or strong Drink,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Levit. 10. 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>when they
went into the Tabernacle of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation;</hi>
and the Reason given is, <hi>That
ye may put a difference between holy and
unholy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">10.</note> 
               <hi>and between unclean and clean;
and that ye may teach the Children of
Israel all the Statutes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">11.</note> 
               <hi>which the Lord
hath spoken to thee by the Hand of</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
Which implies, That those who
are given to drinking <hi>Wine</hi> or <hi>strong
Drink,</hi> are very unfit to instruct o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100520:73"/>
in the Law of God. And God
looked on them as such a Dishonour
to his Worship, that he threatens im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Death to them that approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to his Altar, when they had drank
Wine; and the <hi>Iews</hi> say, that was
the Reason why <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi>
were destroyed. And then God said,
<hi>I will be sanctified in them that come
nigh me.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Levit. 10. 3.</note> All Nations have abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
sottish and drunken Priests, as
most unfit to approach to God when
they were not themselves; or to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
Sacrifices for others, when they
made Beasts of themselves. But this
was not all; for God required from
them who were to teach others the
Law, that they should be always in
a Capacity of understanding and
practising it themselves.</p>
            <p>But if we proceed to the <hi>Prophets,</hi>
nothing can be more dreadful, than
what God saith to <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> That if
he did not warn the People as he
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100520:73"/>
commanded them,<note place="margin">Ezek. 3. 18, 20.</note> 
               <hi>their Blood will I
require at thy hand.</hi>
               <note place="margin">33. 7.</note> Is this Charge now
lying upon every one of you, as to
every Person under your Care?
Who would not rather run into a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,
or hide himself in a Cave,
than take such a Charge upon him?</p>
            <p>But we must distinguish what was
peculiar to the Prophet's immediate
Commission to go to any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Person in God's Name, from a
General Charge to inform Persons
in their Duties, and to tell them the
Danger of continuing in their Sins.
If any fail for want of Information,
when you are bound to give it, the
Neglect must fall heavy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you are bound to take all just
Opportunities in publick and private
to inform those under your Care of
such Sins as you know them to be

In the New Testament the Charge
is General <hi>to feed the Flock of God;</hi>
and <hi>to do it willingly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>not for filthy Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre,
but of a ready mind; and to be
Examples to the Flock.</hi> But St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
who gives this Advice, doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
who belong to <hi>the Flock;</hi>
nor within what Bounds it is to be
limited; and there were many <hi>Flocks</hi>
in the <hi>Iewish</hi> Dispersion, and many
Elders scattered up and down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them in <hi>Pontus, Asia, Galatia,
Cappadocia,</hi> and <hi>Bithynia;</hi> so that here
we have only general and excellent
Advice for such who had Care of the
several Flocks, to carry themselves
towards them with great Humility
and Tenderness, with Charity and
Goodness, as those that made it their
business to do good among them,
and conduct them in the Way to
Heaven.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in his Charge to those
whom he sent for to <hi>Miletus,</hi> tells them,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:100520:74"/>
               <hi>That they must take heed to themselves,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 20. 28.</note>
               <hi>and to all the Flock, over which the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost hath made them Overseers, to
feed the Church of God, which he hath
purchased with his own Blood.</hi> It's pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
here might be a particular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation
of the Flock they were to
<hi>oversee,</hi> by the Direction of the Holy
Ghost; but yet the Charge is general
to take heed to themselves and to
the Flock, and to promote the good
of the Church of God, which <hi>Christ
hath purchased with his own Blood.</hi>
Which are the most weighty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
in the World to excite us
to the utmost Care and Diligence in
Discharge of our Duties.</p>
            <p>In the Epistle to the <hi>Thessalonians</hi>
they are said <hi>to be over them in the
Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Thess. 5. 12.</note> 
               <hi>and to admonish them.</hi> In that
to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 17.</note> 
               <hi>to watch for their
Souls, as they that must give an Account.</hi>
No doubt, very great Care and
Watchfulness is required in all that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:100520:75"/>
take so great and solemn an Office
upon them; but where are the Bounds
and Limits set, as to the People, and
Nature of the Duties required from
them? Must every Man be left to
his own Conscience and Judgment,
what, and how far he is to go? Or
can we suppose all Men equally care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of doing their Duties, if no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Obligation be laid upon them?
Some of the Eloquent Fathers of
the Church, as St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> St. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,</hi>
St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
have allowed themselves so
much in the Flights of Fancy, and
Figures of speaking about the Height
and Dignity of the Sacred Function, as
if they had a mind to discourage all
Men of modest and humble Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
from undertaking it. I do not
wonder that they ran into Solitudes,
and withdrew from the World up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it; but I do wonder how they
came from thence and undertook
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:100520:75"/>
the same Charge afterwards, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
giving an Answer to their own
Arguments. For the World re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
just as it was when they left
it. Mankind were still as impatient
of being governed, or told of their
Faults, as sickle and humoursom, as
prone to Evil, and untractable to
Good, as it was before. And could
they hope it would ever mend by
their running away from it? Or,
was their Duty become more easie
by declining it; I think it was very
well for the Church of God, that,
notwithstanding their own many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
they took the Sacred Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
upon them at last, and did God
and the Church good Service in it.
But if Men were to judge by their
Writings upon this Argument, one
would think none but those who had
a mind to be damned, would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
it. And their great Strains
of Wit and Eloquence, if they had
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100520:76"/>
any Force, would keep the best Men
out of the Church, who were most
likely to do God Service in it; and
we need no other Instances than
these very Persons themselves. And
if all good, and humble, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious
Men should for the sake
of the Hardness of the Work, decline
the Church's Service, and take any
other lawful Imployment, what
would become of the Church of God?
For none that had, or intended to
keep a good Conscience, could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
the Cure of Souls; and so
they must be left to such as had no
Regard to their own; but were either
ignorant, stupid and senseless Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
or such as regarded not their
own Salvation, who durst undertake
such a Task, as would not only add
to their own Guilt, but bring the
heavy Load of other Mens Faults
upon them too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:100520:76"/>
What is now to be done in this
Case? Hath God really imposed such
a Task upon all those who enter
into this Sacred Function, that it is
morally impossible for an honest
Man to discharge it with a good
Conscience? How then can any such
undertake it? But if it may be done,
what are those Bounds and Rules we
are to observe, so as a good Man
may satisfie himself in a competent
Measure, that he hath done his Duty?</p>
            <p>II. And this is that which I shall
now endeavour to clear. For every
one who is in Orders, hath a double
Capacity: One with Respect to the
Church of God in General; another
to that particular Flock which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted
to him, by the Constitution
of this Church, and the Law of the
Land. For although the Nature of
our Duty in general be determined
by the Word of God, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:100520:77"/>
ready shewed, yet the particular Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of every one to his own
Flock, is according to that Power
and Authority, which by the Rules
and Orders of this Church is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to him, and is fully expressed
in the Office of Ordination. By
which it plainly appears, that the
Care of Souls committed to Persons
among us, is not an absolute, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite,
and unaccountable Thing;
but is limited, as to Place, Persons,
and Duties, which are incumbent
upon them. They are <hi>to teach the
People committed to their Charge;</hi> By
whom? By the Bishop when he gives
Institution.</p>
            <p>They are to give private as well as
publick Monitions and Exhortations, as
well to the sick, as to the whle: <hi>What,
to all? No, but</hi> to those within their
Cure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are</hi> to banish erroneous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
and to promote Peace and Love,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:100520:77"/>
especially among them committed to their
Charge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And last of all,</hi> they are to Obey
those who have the Charge and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
over them.</p>
            <p>These things are so express and
plain in the very Constitution of this
Church, and owned so solemnly by
every one that enters into Orders, that
there can be no Dispute concerning
them.</p>
            <p>And from thence we observe se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
things that tend to the Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the main Point, as to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of doing your Duties, as
Incumbents on your several Places.</p>
            <p>I. That it is a Cure of Souls li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
as to Persons and Place, <hi>i.e.</hi>
within such a Precinct as is called a
Parish.</p>
            <p>II. That it is limited as to Power,
with Respect to Discipline.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:100520:78"/>
Therefore I shall endeavour to
clear these Two Things:</p>
            <p>I. What the just Bounds and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of Parochial Cures are.</p>
            <p>II. What is the Measure of that
Diligence which is required within
those Bounds.</p>
            <p>As to the former, we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with the Limitation as to <hi>Place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. That it is a Cure of Souls li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
within certain Bounds which
are called <hi>Parishes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ad proban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Parochia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, primo est necesse quod habeat locum certis finibus constitutum, in quo degat populus illi Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae deputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

certainly known by long Usage and
Custom, and ought still to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
with great Care; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
Confusion and Disputes will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
between several Ministers, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Parishes with one another.
For since the Duties and the Profits
are both limited, it is necessary that
those Bounds should be carefully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
as they generally are by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Perambulations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:100520:78"/>
But there are some who will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
nothing of this bounding of
Ministerial Duties by distinct Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,
who think they are at liberty
to exercise their Gifts where-ever they
are called; and that it were better
that these parochial Inclosures were
thrown open, and all left at liberty
to chuse such whom they liked best,
and under whom they can improve
most.</p>
            <p>These things seem to look plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
at the first Appearance, and to
come nearest to the first gathering of
Churches, before any such thing as
Parishes were known.</p>
            <p>But to me this Arguing looks like
Persons going about now to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
all Dominion and Property in
Lands and Estates, because it seems
not so agreeable with the first natural
Freedom of Mankind; who accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Original Right of Nature,
might pick and chuse what served
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:100520:79"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:100520:80"/>
most to their own Conveniency.
But although this were the first State
of things, yet the great Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
which followed it, upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of Mankind, made Division
and Property necessary; and altho'
there be no express Command of
God for it, yet being so necessary for
the Good of Mankind, it was not
only continued every where, but
those Persons were thought fit to be
punished by severe Laws, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
the Rights and Properties of
others, either by open Violence and
Rapine, or by secret Stealth and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loining</p>
            <p>I grant, that at first there were
no such Parochial Divisions of Cures
here in <hi>England,</hi> as there are now.
For the Bishops and their Clergy
lived in Common; and before that
the Number of Christians was much
increased, the Bishops sent out their
Clergy to preach to the People, as
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100520:80"/>
they saw Occasion. But after the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
had generally embraced Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
this Itinerant and Occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
going from Place to Place, was
found very inconvenient, because of
the constant Offices that were to be
administred; and the Peoples know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to whom they should resort for
Spiritual Offices and Directions.
Hereupon the Bounds of Parochial
Cures were found necessary to be
settled here by degrees, by those Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
who were the great Instruments
of converting the Nation from the
<hi>Saxon</hi> Idolatry. But a Work of this
Nature could not be done all at once,
as by a kind of <hi>Agrarian Law,</hi> but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Steps were taken in order to
it.</p>
            <p>At first,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bed.</hi> l. 1. c. 26.</note> as appears by <hi>Bede,</hi> they
made use of any old <hi>British</hi> Churches
that were left standing; so <hi>Augustin</hi>
at first made use of St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s near
<hi>Canterbury,</hi>
               <note place="margin">c. 33.</note> and after repaired <hi>Christs-Church,</hi>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:100520:81"/>
which were both <hi>British
Churches.</hi> But <hi>Ethelbert</hi> gave all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
both <hi>to repair Old Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and to build New.</hi> However,
the Work went on slowly; <hi>Augustin</hi>
consecrated but two Bishops, which
were setled at <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Rochester,</hi>
where <hi>Ethelbert</hi> built and endowed
two Churches for the Bishops and
their Clergy to live together.<note place="margin">L. 2. c. 3.</note> In the
<hi>Western</hi> Parts <hi>Bicinus</hi> built several
Churches about <hi>Dorchester,</hi>
               <note place="margin">L. 3. c. 7.</note> where his
See was fixed. <hi>Wilfred</hi> converted the
<hi>South-Saxons,</hi> and settled Presbyters
in the <hi>Isle of Wight,</hi> but they were
but two.<note place="margin">L. 4. c. 13, 16.</note> In the Kingdom of <hi>Mercia</hi>
there were five Diocesses made in
<hi>Theodore</hi>'s time; and <hi>Putta,</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Rochester,</hi> being driven from his See,
he obtained from <hi>Saxulphus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">L. 4. c. 12.</note> a <hi>Mercian</hi>
Bishop, a Church with a small Glebe,
and there he ended his Days. In
the <hi>Northern</hi> Parts we read of two
Churches built by two Noblemen,<note place="margin">L. 5. c. 4, 5.</note>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:100520:81"/>
               <hi>(Puch</hi> and <hi>Addi)</hi> upon their own
Manors. And the same might be
done elsewhere; but <hi>Bede</hi> would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have mentioned these, if the
thing had been common. But in
his Epistle to <hi>Egbert,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bed. Epist. ad Egbert. <hi>p.</hi> 64.</note> Archbishop of
<hi>York,</hi> a little before his Death he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates

<hi>Eanbaldus</hi> his time,<note place="margin">Concil. Anglie. 1. 293.</note> the Bishops
were required to find out convenient
places to build Churches in; and
the same passed in the <hi>Southern</hi> Parts
by general Consent. In the Council
of <hi>Cloveshoo,</hi> we read of <hi>Presbyters

built upon their own Lands by the

could only apply a third Part of the
Tithes.<note place="margin">P. 544, 545.</note> But in the Laws of <hi>Canutus,</hi>
we find a fourfold Distinction of
Churches. 1. <hi>The Head Church,</hi> or
the Bishop's See.<note place="margin">P. 540.</note> 2. Churches of a
second Rank, which had Right of
<hi>Sepulture,</hi> and <hi>Baptism,</hi> and <hi>Tithes.</hi>
3. Churches that had Right of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulture,</hi>
but not frequented. 4. <hi>Field-Churches</hi>
or <hi>Oratories,</hi> which had no
Right of Burial. The second sort
seem to be the Original Parochial
Churches which had the Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Tithes, and were so large,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:100520:82"/>
that several other Churches were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of them by the Lords of
Manors; and so the Parishes came
to be multiplied so much, that in
the Laws of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor,
<hi>c.</hi> 9. it is said, <hi>That there were then
Three or Four Churches, where there
had been but One before.</hi> In this Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
I find by an Epistle of <hi>Wulston,</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ansclm. Episi. <hi>l. 4. Ep.</hi> 3.</note> to <hi>Anselm,</hi> that
before the Conquest there were Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in Vills, or upon particular
Manors that were consecrated. And
if <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror demolished
Six and thirty Parish Churches in
the Compass of the <hi>New Forest,</hi> as
is commonly said, there must be a
very great Number before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest;
although so few are said to
appear in <hi>Doomsday Book;</hi> (yet there
are many parochial Churches of this
Diocess in it, above twenty in two
Deanaries) but the <hi>Normans</hi> almost
ruined the parochial Clergy, by
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:100520:83"/>
seizing the Tithes, and making <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations</hi>
of them. But in the
<hi>Saxon</hi> times the Number still encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
as Lords of Manors and others
were willing to erect new Churches,
and to have a settled Parochial Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
among them, who was to
take Care of the Souls of the people
within such a Precinct, as hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the Name of a Parish. But
Parishes now are of a very different
Extent and Value; but the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which the Law puts upon them,
is the same; only where the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
is greater they may have the
more Assistants. And from hence
came the Difference among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial
Clergy; for, those whose Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes
were better endowed, could
maintain inferior Clerks under them,
who might be useful to them in the
publick Service, and assist them in
the Administration of Sacraments.
And this was the true Original of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:100520:83"/>
those we now call <hi>Parish-Clerks;</hi> but
were at first intended as Clerks-As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistant
to him that had the Cure;
and therefore he had the Nomination
of them, as appears by the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Law, both here and abroad.

under the Bishops Authority in Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and other Ecclesiastical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
because the Care of the whole
Diocess belonged to him <hi>Iure Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muni;</hi>
and so it was taken for granted
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:100520:85"/>
in all Parts of the Christian World:
And especially in this Kingdom,
where <hi>Parochial Episcopacy</hi> was never
heard of till of late years. For, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be plainer in our History,
than what is affirmed in two of our
Laws, Stat. of <hi>Carlisle, 25 E.</hi> 1. and
the Stat. of <hi>Provisors, 25 E. 3. That
the Church of</hi> England <hi>was founded in
Prelacy,</hi> or <hi>Diocesan Episcopacy.</hi> For
our first Bishops were so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
confined to one <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Town,</hi>
that at first in the <hi>Saxon</hi>-Division of
Kingdoms, every Bishop had his
Diocess equal with the Extent of the
Kingdom, except in <hi>Kent,</hi> where one
Suffragan to the Archbishop at <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi>
was confirmed.</p>
            <p>The first Conversion of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Nation to Christianity from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganism,
was by the Diocesan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
who were sent hither from
several Parts, and the Presbyters im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
by them; and as the Number
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:100520:85"/>
of Christians increased, the Number
of Bishops did so too; so that in
the Parts of <hi>Mercia</hi> one Diocess was
divided into five, that they might
the better look after the Government
of them; and every Bishop, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the <hi>Saxon</hi>-Councils, was
bound to see parochial Churches
built, and the Clergy to be settled in
them to attend upon the Duties of
their Function among the people
committed to their Charge.</p>
            <p>That which I have aimed at in
this Discourse, was to shew, That
the Original Constitution of this
Church, was <hi>Episcopal;</hi> but yet that
the Bishops did still design to fix a
<hi>Parochial Clergy</hi> under them, as Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
could be built and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>It remains now to shew, That this
Constitution of a <hi>Parochial Clergy,</hi> is
more reasonable, than that of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed,
and unsettled Clergy by Law;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:100520:86"/>
which will easily appear, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,</p>
            <p>1. The greater Advantage as to
Unity, and real Edification among
the People. For this makes them to be
as one Body within certain Bounds:
And the People know whither to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
for publick Worship and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and the Inconveniencies, as
to the difference of Mens Abilities,
is not so great, as the Inconveniency
of a broken, divided people, as to
Religion; which always creates Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions
and Jealousies, and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Contempt and Hatred of each
other. And I think every wise and
good Christian will consider, that
which tends to Peace and Unity, is
really more Edifying than a far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Talent of Elocution, or the most
moving Way of exciting the Fancies
and Passions of Hearers. For, S. <hi>Paul</hi>
tells us, <hi>Charity</hi> is beyond <hi>miraculous
Gifts.</hi> It is easie to observe, that the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:100520:86"/>
wisest Methods are seldom the most
popular; because the generality of
Mankind do not judge by Reason,
but by Fancy, and Humour, and
Prejudices of one kind or other.
From hence the Heats of Enthusiasm,
and odd Gestures, and vehement
Expressions, with no deep or cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Sense, take much more with
ordinary and injudicious people, than
the greatest Strength and clearness of
Reason, or the soundest Doctrine,
and the most pious Exhortation, if
they be not set off in such a Way as
strikes their Imaginations, and raises
their Passions. And this is that which
such do commonly call the most
Edifying Way of Preaching, which
is like the coming up of the Tide
with Noise and Violence, but leaves
little Effect; whereas the other is like
a constant Stream which goes on in
a steady and even Course, and makes
the Earth more fruitful. The one is
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:100520:87"/>
like a Storm of Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
which startles, and confounds,
and amuses more; but the other is
like a gentle Rain which softens and
mellows the Ground, and makes it
more apt to produce kindly and
lasting Fruit. We are to judge of
true Edification, not by the sudden
Heat and Motion of Passions, but
by producing the genuine Effects of
true Religion; which are fixing our
Minds on the greatest and truest
Good, and calming and governing
our disorderly Passions, and leading
<hi>a godly, righteous and sober Life.</hi> But
we too often find violent and boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous
Passions, an ungovernable
Temper, Envy, Strife and Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableness,
growing up with greater
Pretences to Zeal, and better Ways
of Edification.</p>
            <p>I never expect to see the World
so wise, as to have Persons and
Things universally esteemed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:100520:87"/>
to their Real Worth. For there
will be a Tincture in most persons,
from Temper, and Inclination, and
the Principles of Education; but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
speaking Matters of Order
and Decency, and Things which
tend to a publick Good, affect those
most, who have the best Judgment
and Temper; and irregular Heats,
and disorderly Methods of praying
and preaching, those whose Religion
makes more Impression upon their
Fancies, than their Judgments, and
is seen more in the inflaming their
Passions, than in keeping them in
their due Order.</p>
            <p>2. There is a greater Advantage
as to Discipline: For, if among the
Teachers they are under no Bounds
nor Subjection to a Superiour Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
it is very easie to avoid any
kind of Censure for the most cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Doctrines or Practices. We
cannot boast much of the strict
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:100520:88"/>
Exercise of Discipline among us;
and one great Reason is, That many
have more mind to complain of the
Want of it, than to do their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to amend it. We hear of
many Complaints of the Clergy in
general, and sometimes by those
who have more mind to have them
thought guilty, than to prove them
so, for fear they should acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or at least the Church should
not bear the blame of their Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages.
But we cannot proceed
arbitrarily, we must allow them
timely notice, and summon them to
appear, and a just Liberty of Defence;
but if upon Proof, and sufficient
Evidence we have not proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them with the just Severity
of the Law, then we ought to bear
the Blame, but not otherwise. But
whatsoever personal Neglects or Faults
there have been, or may be, my
Business is to shew, that our Way
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:100520:88"/>
is much better fitted for the just
Exercise of Discipline, than that of
Independant Congregations, altho'
the Managers of them pick and
cull out the best they can for their
Purpose; and one would think,
when they had made choice of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
to their mind, and bound them
together by an Explicit Covenant,
they should be very easie, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable,
and submissive to their own
Discipline. But they have found
the contrary by their sad Experience;
they grow too heady and wilful to
bear any such thing as strict Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline;
for when they had the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to exercise it, their Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were soon broken to pieces, and
the several divided Parts were for
setting up new Heads one against a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
till at last they found it was
much easier to be Teaching than to
be Ruling Elders. And so they have
let the Reins of Discipline fall to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:100520:89"/>
keep their Congregations together.
But suppose the Teachers should fall
out among themselves; as, to give
a fresh and late remarkable Instance:
Suppose some set up <hi>Antinomianism,</hi>
and preach such Doctrines to the
People or Flocks before you, which
others think of dangerous Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
What is to be done in such
a Case? They may send some Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
to enquire whether the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of fact be true. Suppose they
find them true, What then? What is
to be done next? It may be, some
would have them come up to their
Brethren and answer to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations
brought against them. But
suppose they will not; and others
of the Brethren say, they ought not;
and so fall into Heats and Disputes
among themselves about it, and
make new Parties and Divisions: Is
not this an admirable Way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
Peace, and Order, and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:100520:89"/>
in a Church? And I am as
certain, this is not the Way of
Christ's appointing, as I am, that <hi>God
is the God of Order, and not of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion;</hi>
and that when Christ left the
Legacy of Peace to his Church, he
left a Power in some to see his Will
performed. But these things can
never be objected against us; for all
are Members of the same Body, and
are governed by certain and known
Rules; and if any be guilty of open
Violation of it, the Way is open to
accuse and prosecute them; and if
they be found guilty, the Censures
of the Church will render them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of doing it in such a Station;
or at least, to bring them to Confession
of their Fault, and Promise of future
Amendment. And now I leave
any one to judge, whether the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial
Clergy</hi> are not under greater and
better Discipline, than the Teachers
of the separate Congregations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:100520:90"/>
II. But the great Complaint of
such Men is, That we want <hi>Parochial
and Congregational Discipline,</hi> so that
Faults should be examined and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
where they have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
but instead of that, all Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are drawn into the Ecclesiastical
Court, and there Causes are managed
so, as looks rather like a Design to
punish Men in their Purses, than
for their Faults; and the Delays are
so great, that the Court it self seems
to be designed for Penance, and
grows very uneasie, even to those
who are the Members of our Church.
And some think that the proceeding
against Men upon Articles of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
not so agreeable to the Rights
and Liberties of Mankind. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to this, I shall consider, (1.) The
Proceedings upon Enquiry at Visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
(2.) The Method of Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Ecclesiastical Courts.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:100520:90"/>
(3.) The Inconveniencies of parochial
Discipline.</p>
            <p>1. As to Enquiries at <hi>Visitations.</hi>
They were grounded upon one of the
main Pillars of our Law, <hi>viz.</hi> an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
immemorial Custom founded
upon good Reason: In the first Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
that ever were made in this
Church under <hi>Theodore,</hi> Archbishop
of <hi>Canterbury;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Concil. Angls 1. <hi>p.</hi> 183.</note> the second is, <hi>That
every Bishop is to look after the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his own Diocess, and not to invade
anothers.</hi> And that in so doing they
went about their Diocesses in order
to an Enquiry and Correction of
Miscarriages, is evident from the
<hi>Council</hi> under <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> Archbishop
of <hi>Canterbury, Can.</hi> 3. 25. the first
Council at <hi>Calechyth, Can.</hi> 3. the
Constitutions of <hi>Odo,</hi> Archbishop of
<hi>Canterbury, Can.</hi> 3. and the Canon
of <hi>Edgar, Can.</hi> 3. But in these <hi>Saxon
times,</hi> the Visitations were annual,
which were found inconvenient;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:100520:91"/>
and therefore in the <hi>Norman</hi> times,
the Archdeacons were taken into a
part of the Jurisdiction under the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
and visited those years the
Bishop did not. But we meet with
no <hi>Archdeacons</hi> with any kind of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
in the <hi>Saxon</hi> times; we
read indeed sometimes of the Name
of <hi>Archdeacons,</hi> but they had nothing
to do in the Diocess, but only at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the Bishop at Ordinations,
and other publick Services in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral.
<hi>Lanfranc</hi> was the first who
made an <hi>Archdeacon</hi> with Jurisdiction
in his See.<note place="margin">Angl. Sacr. 1. 150.</note> And <hi>Thomas</hi> first Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of <hi>York,</hi> after the Conquest,
was the first who divided his Diocess
into <hi>Archdeaconries;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Stub. Vit. Arch.</note> and so did <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migius,</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> his large
Diocess into Seven <hi>Archdeaconries,</hi>
saith <hi>H.</hi> of <hi>Huntingdon:</hi>
               <note place="margin">H. Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Angl. Sacr.</note> And so it
was with the rest; of which there
were two Occasions, 1. The laying
aside the <hi>Corepiscopi</hi> in the Western
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:100520:91"/>
Parts, as assuming too much to
themselves. 2. The publick Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which the Bishops were more
strictly tied to, as the King's Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons
in the <hi>Norman</hi> times: Which
was the Reason not only of taking
in Archdeacons, but likewise of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presbyters
or Rural-Deans, who had
some Inspection into the several
Deanaries, and assisted the Bishop in
such things, as they were appointed
to do; and then came in the other
Ecclesiastical Officers, as <hi>Vicars Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
Chancellors, Commissaries,</hi> &amp;c. for
we read not of them here at all in the
<hi>Saxon times;</hi> but about the time of
<hi>Hen.</hi> II. the Bishops took them for
their Assistance in Dispatch of Causes,
when the King required their strict
Attendance on the publick Affairs
in the Supreme Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>2. As to the Method of Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Ecclesiastical Courts, it is
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:100520:92"/>
no other than hath been continued
here without Interruption, till of late
years, ever since the Conquest. For
the Consistory-Court, and the Rules
of Proceeding there, were establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a Law in the time of <hi>William</hi>
the First. As far as I can find by
King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Laws, <hi>c.</hi> 4. the Bishops
did then proceed by the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Laws, although they then sat in
the County-Court; but this caused
so much Confusion, that <hi>William,</hi> by
a general Consent, and a Charter di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to all the People of <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Concil. Angl. 11. 14.</note>
doth separate the Ecclesiastical from
the Temporal Courts; which was
enrolled as good Law, 2 <hi>R.</hi> 2. upon
occasion of a Suit of the Dean and
Chapter of <hi>Lincoln;</hi> and therefore the
Charter of <hi>Remigius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln,</hi>
is more mentioned than others,
but the same was to all the Bishops
and Counties of <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Seld. 14. 1. 4 l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st. 259.</note> as appears
by other Copies of it. Thus the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:100520:92"/>
Consistory-Court was first establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as a distinct Court from the
County-Court, which it was not in
the <hi>Saxon times,</hi> for then the Bishop
sate with the Civil Magistrate in the
same Court;<note place="margin">Tit. H. 1. c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> and Ecclesiastical Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
were first heard and decided there.
It seems the People wer very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to go to a new Place; and
therefore the Law is inforced with
severe Penalties for Contempt. And
those who object against the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of the Method of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
in those Courts, must reflect
upon some of the wisest Nations in
the World, who have gone upon
the same Grounds, in all that have
received the Civil Law, and upon
some of the greatest Courts at this
time in the Kingdom, as the <hi>Chancery</hi>
and <hi>Admiralty,</hi> which go by the same
Fundamental Rules. As to any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
which arise from the personal
Faults of those who are imployed in
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:100520:93"/>
them, that reaches, I am afraid, to
all Courts; and it ought to be the
Work and Business of those who
look after them, to do what in them
lies, to reform them, that others
Faults may not be laid at their
Doors.</p>
            <p>3. But for those who would have
a <hi>Parochial</hi> or <hi>Congregational Discipline</hi>
set up, as much better, and more
effectual, I shall desire them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that since Matters of Discipline
are such, as that in them the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and Interest of Persons is very
much concerned, they ought not to
be left to Arbitrary Proceedings of
any Persons, but they ought to be
managed by the certain and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Rules of Justice; since every
Man hath a Right to defend himself,
when he is accused. And unless there
be known and established Methods
of Proceeding agreeable to natural
Justice, and the Laws of the Land,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:100520:93"/>
nothing would be more grievous
and intolerable than the common
Exercise of a Parochial Discipline.
For,</p>
            <p>1. It cannot be presumed, that
there will be competent Judges. For
every one who hath a Faculty of
Preaching, hath not a Faculty of
Judging in such Cases. And where
Discretion and a Judgment of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
is wanting, an honest
Mind will not secure Men from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Injury, and exposing their Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature
to Contempt.</p>
            <p>2. They have no fixed and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
Rules of proceeding, as there
are in the Ecclesiastical Courts, which
have been continued down from
time to time, and allowed by the
Laws of the Land. And what mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
Disorder must follow an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
Method, when Humour, and
Will, and Passion may over-rule Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and Equity, and Conscience?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:100520:94"/>
3. They are not under the Check
of the Law, as the Ecclesiastical
Courts are. For, if they exceed their
Bounds, either as to the Nature of
the Cause, or the Manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
they are liable to Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from the King's Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice;
but the Law can take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of <hi>Parochial</hi> or <hi>Congregational</hi>
Judicatures, and so Men may suffer
without Remedy.</p>
            <p>4. They have no way to judge of
Legal Evidence, which is very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
when a person is accused. It
is one of the nicest Points in all cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
Proceedings to determine what
is good and sufficient Evidence. For
several things are to be weighed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
either Witnesses or Testimonies
can be allowed. As to Witnesses,
it is required that they be persons of
Reputation, and free from Infamy of
Law and Fact; that they be disinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested,
and so not liable to the just
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:100520:94"/>
Suspicion of Partiality; that they be
Men of <hi>Discretion and sane Memory;</hi>
and all reasonable Exceptions are
to be allowed against them. As to
Testimonies; they must be by our
Law upon Oath; and what Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
have such Persons to give an
Oath, and why shall a Man be lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to suffer by a Testimony, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
one, when the Law requires it?
They must be deliberate, and not
given in Passion, consistent as to
Time, Place, and other Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
They must be certain and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive,
and not upon Hear-say, or
the Believing of other persons: They
must be free from any just Suspicion
of Contrivance and Conspiracy, or
any sort of Corruption or Partiality.
And now is every parochial Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
or select Congregation fit to
judge of these Matters, whereon the
Reputation, and consequently the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of every person may be so deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concerned?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:100520:95"/>
5. They have no way to prevent
a percipitate and hasty Sentence. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a Man be accused by one of
Interest and Passion, who possesses
others with the same Opinion before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
and the Judges are all preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced
before the Matter comes to be
heard; and in popular Assemblies
some few men sway the rest, what a
Case is a person accused unjustly in?
He hath no Liberty for others that
are not of the Congregation, altho'
more disinterested, either to come
in to judge, or to plead for him:
He can have no Advocate to defend
him, or to shew the Weakness, or
Inconsistency of the Evidence against
him. In all Ecclesiastical Courts,
they may sometimes proceed summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
but even then the Fundamental
Rules of the Court must be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
as to Proofs and Witnesses, or
else the Sentence is void; but here
the Sentence will take place, altho'
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:100520:95"/>
there hath not been the least Colour
of Justice in the whole Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>6. Here is no settled Course of
Appeals in Case of a wrong Sentence.
But where Men are liable to Mistake
and Passion, a Right of Appeal is
one of the Fundamental parts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.
And therefore Independent
and Arbitrary Courts of Judicature,
as all Congregational Churches are,
are inconsistent with the common
Rights of Mankind, and that due
Subordination which ought to be in
all Societies in order to the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Order and Justice among Men.
But suppose, parochial Discipline
so settled among us, as to allow a
Liberty of Appeal, how would the
Trouble, and Vexation, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
be increased, by going from
the parochial Sentence to the Bishop's
Court, and from thence still further?
So that if there be some Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:100520:96"/>
in point of Distance, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to be summoned to appear at
first so far from Home, yet there is
some Compensation by the less
Trouble and Charges, if due Care
be taken to prevent Delays, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary
Expences; which ought to
be done: And those who do make
the greatest Clamour against our
Courts, are rather willing they should
continue such as they may have
Cause to complain of, than to do
their Endeavours to reform them.</p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavoured to shew
the just Bounds and Limits of paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial
Cures.</p>
            <p>II. I now come to consider the
just Measure of that Diligence which
is required under those Limits. For
our Church requires <hi>Faithful Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi>
in Preaching, and Sacraments,
and Prayers, and Reading the Holy
Scriptures. If then we can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:100520:96"/>
what this <hi>Faithful Diligence</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
we may come to satisfie our
selves whether we do our Duty or
not.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Faithful Diligence</hi> implies se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Application of our Minds to
the main End and Design of our
Holy Function: Which is to do
good to the Souls of Men, especially
to those committed to your Charge.
And an idle, careless, santering
Life; or one too busie and distracted
with the Cares of the World, are
not consistent with it. I do not go
about to take you off from necessary
Business, and reasonable Allowances,
as to Health and Studies; but that
the doing good to your peoples
Souls, ought to be the principal and
chief Design of your Thoughts,
Studies and Endeavours. And if the
people be satisfied that this is really
your Design among them, you will
find, that your Doctrine will be
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:100520:97"/>
easier received, your Persons esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and your Labours valued. It is
possible, you may meet with a
froward, peevish, self-willed people;
and it is hard when a Man is only
set to water and mend a Hedge made
up of Briars and Thorns; the more
pains he takes, the more Scratches
he may meet with; but if it be your
Lot, be not discouraged from doing
your Duty: Remember what sort
of people the Prophets were sent to,
and what Usage they had from them;
what Hardships and Reproaches
Christ and his Apostles underwent
from a very unkind World; but a
patient Continuance in well-doing,
gave them inward Satisfaction in the
midst of all, and did by degrees
gain the Christian Doctrine Access
to the Hearts of those who most op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
it.</p>
            <p>2. It implies an honest and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious
Care of discharging the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:100520:97"/>
known and common Duties of your
Function, as Preaching, Praying, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techizing,
Administring Sacraments,
Visiting the Sick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A diligent
Person is one who neglects no good
Opportunities of doing his Business,
but watches for them, and studies to
improve them to the best Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
Can those satisfie themselves
that they use <hi>Faithful Diligence,</hi> who
shamefully neglect their Cures, and
care not how seldom they come at
them, nor how they are supplied, if
they make a good Bargain for their
own Advantage? I cannot deny, but
that according to the Laws of the
Land, and the Canons of this Church,
some Persons are allowed to have
two several Cures, which must im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
a Non-residence for some time
at least, upon one of them. But
they still suppose, that there are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
Resident upon them, who are
allowed by the Bishop to be sufficient
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:100520:98"/>
to discharge the necessary Duties of
the place, and not to be taken up
like Post-horses, the next that comes,
and to be turned off at the next Stage.
I think it a very great Fault in those
who have Pluralities, that they look
no more after the Curates they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy,
and that they do not bring
them to the Bishop to be approved,
and to have their Allowance fixed,
before they imploy them. They
think no more is required but to
pay the Fees for a Licence; but I
have, and shall endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the Clergy of this Diocess,
that Licences are not to be taken as
St. <hi>Peter</hi> took <hi>the Fish that first came
with Money in the Mouth of it;</hi> I hope
to be able to satisfie them, that it is
not the Fees that we aim at, but at
Persons doing their Duties. And
our Canons are express,<note place="margin">Can. 48.</note> That no
Curate is to be allowed in any Cure
of Souls, that hath not been exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:100520:98"/>
and admitted by the Bishop
or Ordinary having Episcopal Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
and attested by the Hand
and Seal of the Bishop. How then
come Curates to officiate without
ever coming to the Bishop at all, or
undergoing any Examination by
him? This is a plain Breach of the
Canon, and ought to be reformed.
I do not say, that such Licences as
have customarily passed without the
<hi>Bishop's Hand and Seal,</hi> are void;
but I do say, That they are irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and voidable, and none ought to
be allowed, which are not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Canon; and that no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
ought to take any one for
his Curate till the Bishop hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
and approved him under his
Hand and Seal. And this Remedy
the Law gives us against the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
which attend Pluralities by
weak and insufficient Curates; But
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:100520:99"/>
no Man is excused either by Law or
Canons from attending the Duties of
his Place at some times in his own
Person,<note place="margin">Can. 41.</note> and that <hi>good Part of the Year;</hi>
in which time he ought to do the
Duties of his Place with Diligence
and Care; and to acquaint himself
with his Parishioners, in order to the
better Discharge of his Duty towards
them. They have very mean
Thoughts of their holy Function,
that think the main Part of it lies on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Pulpit (I wish even that
were minded more) but all the
Ways you can do good among your
People, is within the Compass of
your Duty; not meerly to instruct
them in Religion, but to prevent
Quarrels, and Contentions, and Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
for Debauchery, which tend to
corrupt Mens Minds, and draw
them off from the Principles as well
as Practice of true Religion: It
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:100520:99"/>
is your Duty to endeavour to make
them live like good Christians and
good Neighbours, and to set Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns
your selves of Sobriety, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Charity, and of every thing
Praise-worthy.</p>
            <p>3. Faithful Diligence <hi>implies filling
up your vacant Hours with the most
useful Studies, as to the main End of
your Function. For in your Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
you solemnly promise</hi> to lay
aside the Study of the World and the
Flesh, and to apply your selves to the
Study of the Scriptures, and such Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
as help to the Knowledge of the
same.</p>
            <p>But it may be seasonably asked by
some, What Method and Course
of Studies will best conduce to that
End?</p>
            <p>To this I shall endeavour to give
a short Answer so far as it concerns
the main End of your Function,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:100520:100"/>
which it is most proper for me to
consider at this time.</p>
            <p>1. Look well to the Temper of
your Minds, that it be humble, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and religious. For a vain, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
and self-opinionated Person can
never have an inward and hearty
Relish of Divine Truths. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
will appear to him either too
plain and easie, or too obscure and
intricate; some things will seem low
and flat, and others too lofty and
Poetical. Those who read not with
a good Mind, will have always some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
or other to cavil at. It is a
mighty Advantage in all Spiritual
Knowledge to come to it with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biassed
Mind, free from the Power
of Prejudice and evil Inclinations.
For these give a strange Tincture
to the Mind, and hinder the clear
and distinct Perception of Revealed
Truths, as above the Natural Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:100520:100"/>
which God hath given us. Some
are therefore so fond of Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Speculations, that unless the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Scripture suits with them,
they are ready to despise it, and only
Shame and Fear keep up any Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
for it in them. Some are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
for Mathematical Evidence
and Demonstration, as though the
Way to Salvation were to be shewed
by Lines and Figures; Why do
they not first run down all Laws
and History, because they are not
capable of Mathematical Evidence.
And it argues a far greater Measure
of true Understanding to know when
to be satisfied, than to be always
disputing and cavilling. The plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Scripture in some places, is no
more an Offence to one that wisely
considers the Design of it, than a
beaten Road is to a Traveller who
desires to know which is the true
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:100520:101"/>
Way to his Journeys End, and the
plainer it is, the more he is satisfied
with it. But the Scripture wants not
its Depths, which require a very
Attentive and Considering Mind,
and will afford Matter for Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of Thoughts, and frequent and
serious Meditation. The Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Scripture is, That all
necessary things are plain; and
such as are not so, although they
are not necessary to be known
for Salvation, yet require our Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to understand them; and
give great Satisfaction as far as we
can know them.</p>
            <p>2. Not to perplex your Minds
with Difficulties above your Reach,
as in what relates to the Eternal
Decrees, and the particular Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of that Unity of the Godhead
which is consistent with the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Persons. For since the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:100520:101"/>
Scripture doth assert both, we may
safely be contented with what the
Scripture reveals, although the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of it be incomprehensible. And
as to the other the Scripture is
clear and positive, as to the Moral
Parts of our Duties; and if we
are to seek how to reconcile them
with Gods Decrees, we have this
certain Rule to go by, That with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doing our Duty, we cannot
be happy; but we may without
understanding how the Freedom of
our Wills is consistent with the Divine
Prescience and Decrees.</p>
            <p>3. Not to fix plain and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Duties upon new and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable
Theories. As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;
There are no Duties of
greater Consequence, than the Love
of God and our Neighbour: But
it would be unspeakable Mischief
to Religion to fix the Love of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:100520:102"/>
God upon so absurd a Principle
as his being the immediate Cause
of all Sensation in us. And it would
have made the Christian Doctrine
ridiculous to found its Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Precepts on extravagant Notions,
and Mystical Contemplations. And
so for the Love of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to allow only a Love of
Benevolence and Charity, and not
of <hi>Delight</hi> and <hi>Complacency,</hi> is to
make Nice Distinctions, where
God hath made none. But to take
away the Love of Complacency
in Friends and Relations, and the
Blessings which God gives for the
Comfort of Life, is to overthrow
the due Sense of God's Goodness
in giving them; and to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
a great Measure of that Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
we owe to God for them.
But when any seem very fond
of such Notions, and shew so
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:100520:102"/>
much Self-Complacency in them;
it is impossible upon such Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
that they should love their
Neighbours as themselves.</p>
            <p>4. If you would understand
the New Testament aright, fix in
your Minds a true Scheme of the
State of the Controversies of that.
Time, which will give you more
light into the true knowledge of
the Scriptures, than large Volumes
of Commentators, or the best Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stems
of Modern Controversies.
As what the <hi>Iewish</hi> Notions of
Justification by Works, and Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of Sin, were; and of God's
Decrees of Election and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
as to themselves: And what
the Principles of the Judaizing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
were, as to the joyning the
Law and the Gospel, and the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagorean</hi>
Superstition together. And
what the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> who were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:100520:103"/>
Libertines, held, as to Grace,
Redemption, Liberty, Government,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which tend very much
to the clearing the Sense of the New
Testament.</p>
            <p>5. Where the Sense appears
doubtful, and Disputes have been
raised about it, enquire into the
Sense of the Christian Church in
the first Ages, as the best Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter
of Scripture; as whether
the Apostles left Bishops or Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
to succeed them in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Churches; Whether the
Apostles appointed the Lords Day
to be observed as the Day of
Publick Worship; Whether Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
were not to be Administred
to Infants as well as Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
both being Seals of God's
Covenant; Whether Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
doth not belong to Christ,
and were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> given to him in
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:100520:103"/>
the Hymns and Doxologies of the
Primitive Church; and, Whether
Divine Worship can be given to
any Creature; Whether the Form
of Baptism was not understood
so, as to imply a Trinity of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
and, Whether all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
were not Baptized into this
Faith; and consequently, Whether
denying the Trinity be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
Christian Baptism. These
and many other such Questions
of great Importance, receive great
Light from the Writings of the first
Ages.</p>
            <p>But some Rules may be very
useful for right judging the Sense of
those Times.</p>
            <p>1. To distinguish the Genuine
and Supposititious Writings of that
Time. This hath been examined
with so much Care by Learned
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:100520:104"/>
Men of this last Age, that it is
no hard matter to make a true Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
about them.</p>
            <p>2. In those that are Genuine,
to distingush the Sense of the
Church, delivered by them, from
their own particular Opinions;
the Sense of the Church is best
known by Publick Acts, as by
Creeds, Sacraments, Hymns, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Censures of such as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
or contradict them.</p>
            <p>3. To put a Difference between
the Authority of private Persons,
and of the Bishops and Governours
of the Church, who may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
to understand the Sense of
the Church, and the Doctrine of
the Apostles better than the other.
And so <hi>Clemens, Ignatius, Polycarp,
Theophilus,</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> are more to
be trusted, as to the Sense and
Practice of the Christian Church,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100520:104"/>
than such as <hi>Hermes,</hi> and <hi>Papias,</hi>
and <hi>Tatianus,</hi> who had neither the
Judgment nor the Authority of the
other.</p>
            <p>4. That may be justly look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on as the Sense of the Church,
which is owned both by the <hi>Friends</hi>
and the <hi>Enemies</hi> of it. The Enemies
of Christianity charged them with
many Things, which the Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gists
utterly denied. Now we find
<hi>Pliny</hi> charging the Christians with
singing Hymns to Christ, as to
God; several Christian Writers of
that time mention this, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
go about to soften, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse,
or deny it. And so we find
<hi>Lucian</hi> deriding the Christians for
the Doctrine of <hi>Three</hi> and <hi>One;</hi>
which the Apologists of that time
are so far from denying, that they
assert and vindicate it, as appears
by <hi>Athenagoras</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:100520:105"/>
But these things I only touch
at, to shew how the Sense of the
Church is to be taken, and how
from thence the Sense of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
may be cleared.</p>

            <head>OF THE
Particular Duties
OF THE
PAROCHIAL CLERGY,
AT A
VISITATION,
<date>October 27<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 1696.</date>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Brethren,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS often as it pleases God in
his wise Providence to bring
me among you in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Course of my Visitation, I
cannot satisfie my self that I do my
own Duty, unless I put you in mind
of doing yours. We live in an Age,
wherein the Contempt of the Clergy
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:100520:106"/>
is too notorious not to be observed;
but the true Reasons are not so well
considered as they ought to be. Some,
to increase the Contempt of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
have given such Reasons of it,
as seem to make it a light and jest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
matter; but truly it is very
far from being so: For the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Religion is oft-times both
the Cause and the Effect of it. It
is not at all to be wondred at, that
those <hi>who hate to be reformed,</hi> should
hate those whose Duty and Business
it ought to be to endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
them. But when Religion is
struck at through our Sides, we ought
with Patience to bear the Wounds
and Reproaches we receive in so good
a Cause. <hi>Wo be to us,</hi> if those who
are Enemies to Religion, <hi>speak well
of us:</hi> For it is a strong Presumption
that they take us to be of their side
in our Hearts, and that we are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
only by our Profession,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:100520:106"/>
which they look on only as our
Trade. And we give too much occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for such Suspicions of us, if we
do not heartily concern our selves
for the Honour and Interest of true
Religion in the World, whatever
we may suffer, as to our Reputation,
for the sake of it. It is possible, that
if we go about to humour such
Persons in their Infidelity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Religion, we may escape
some hard Words for the present, but
they cannot but have the greatest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Contempt and Hatred of all
those who live upon Religion, and
yet have not the Courage to defend
it. And what Satisfaction can such
have, when they reflect upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and think what Occasion they
have given to confirm such Persons
in their Infidelity, and to make them
think the worse of Religion for their
sakes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:100520:107"/>
The best thing we can do to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Honour of Religion, and
to set our Profession above <hi>Contempt,</hi>
is to apply our selves seriously and
conscientiously to do our Duties. For
if others find that we are in earnest,
and make it our great Business to do
all the Good we can, both in the
Pulpit, and out of it; if we behave
our selves with that Gravity, Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Meekness and Charity which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
so holy a Profession, we shall
raise our selves above the common
Reproaches of a spiteful World;
and do what lies in us to stop the
Mouths at least, if not to gain the
Hearts of our Enemies.</p>
            <p>For the Real Esteem which Men
have of others, is not to be gained
by the little Arts of Address and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuation,
much less by complying
with them in their Follies; but by a
steady and resolute Practice of our
own Duties, joyned with a gentle,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:100520:107"/>
and easie, and obliging Behaviour
to others, so far as is consistent with
them. But a proud, supercilious,
morose Behaviour towards our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Enemies, doth but make them
much more so; if any thing softens
them, and makes them more tractable,
it will be, joyning a Firmness of Mind,
as to our plain Duties, with Humility
and Kindness in other Matters.</p>
            <p>But what are these Duties we are
obliged to so much Care in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of?</p>
            <p>There is a Twofold Obligation
lying upon us.</p>
            <p>I. That which is more General
from the Nature and Design of our
Imployment; which is <hi>the Cure of
Souls;</hi> and that requires great Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and Faithfulness, frequent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection
and Consideration, serious
Application of our selves to Divine
Studies and Imployments; a prudent
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:100520:108"/>
Use of the best Methods for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing,
Reproving, Directing and
Assisting those who are committed
to our Care. And all these are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
in the Nature of our Office, as
it is set forth in holy Scripture;
wherein we are described as <hi>Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</hi>
and therefore must take Pains,
and not spend our time in vain and
idle Company: As <hi>Teachers,</hi> and
therefore ought to be stored with a
good Stock of Knowledge our selves,
and be ready to communicate it to
others: As <hi>Pastors,</hi> and so we ought
to look after our Flock, and not
leave them to the careless Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of others, who are not so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
for their Welfare, as we ought
to be: As <hi>Ambassadors from Christ,</hi>
and therefore we are bound to look
after the Business we are sent upon
and the great Weight and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of it, as to your own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as well as others: As <hi>Stewards
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:100520:108"/>
of the Mysteries of God,</hi> and the first
thing required in them, is to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
their Trust honestly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
remembring the Account they
must give to God.</p>
            <p>But these, you may say, are only
general Things, and do not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
and limit our Duties within
certain Bounds; what is there which
doth fix and determine our Duties,
as to the Station we have in this
Church?</p>
            <p>II. I come therefore to the <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Duties,</hi> which by the Ancient
Constitution of this Church, and
the Ecclesiastical Laws of it, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
upon you. And you are
to consider, that as the Law hath
taken Care for your Maintenance
and Subsistence in doing your Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
so it doth suppose your careful
Performance of them, not only in
regard to the general Rule of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
but to that particular Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:100520:109"/>
you are under, as Members
of this Church. And therefore I shall
enquire into Two things:</p>
            <p>I. The Duties you are under this
Obligation to.</p>
            <p>II. The Incouragement which the
Law gives in Consideration of it.</p>
            <p>I. The Duties are of two sorts:</p>
            <p>1. Publick and Solemn. 2. Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
and Occasional.</p>
            <p>1. Publick and Solemn; and
those either respect the Time, or the
Duties themselves.</p>
            <p>1. As to the times of Solemn and
Publick Worship, which are the
Weekly Lord's Days, and the other
Holy-days.</p>
            <p>1. I begin with the Observation
of the Lord's Days; which I shall
now make appear to have been set
apart for the solemn Worship and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:100520:109"/>
of God, especially by the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
from the first Settlement of a
Parochial Clergy in this Church.</p>
            <p>In a Provincial Council held at
<hi>Cloveshoo</hi> or <hi>Cliff,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Concil. Angl. 1. 249.</note> 
               <hi>A. D.</hi> 747. the
King and Nobility being present
(where the Archbishop and Bishops
Assembled for Regulating the
Worship of God in Parochial Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
then newly erected in many
places) the Fourteenth Canon is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press,
That the Lord's Day ought
to be celebrated with due Veneration,
and devoted only to Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<hi>(Divino tantum cultui dedicatus)
and the Presbyters are required to officiate
in their several Churches, both in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Praying; and the People are
required to let alone their common worldly
Affairs, and to attend the publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Canons of <hi>Egbert,</hi> Archbishop
of <hi>York,</hi> are as clear and full for the
<hi>Northern</hi> Province, as the other for
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:100520:110"/>
the <hi>Southern, Can. 104. That nothing
is to be done on the Lord's Day, but
what tends to the Worship and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God.</hi> And <hi>Can. 36. That
Christ sanctified the Lord's Day by his
Resurrection.</hi> But because these Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of <hi>Egbert</hi> will be often used,
something ought to be observed to
clear their Authority.<note place="margin">Concil. Angl. I. 258.</note> Sir <hi>H. Spelman</hi>
saith, there are several Ancient <hi>MSS.</hi>
of them. Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> owns the <hi>Cotton
MS.</hi> to be of the time of <hi>H.</hi> 1. but
he suspects that another made the
Collection, and put it under his
Name. But it was no strange thing
for the great Bishops to make such
a Collection of Canons; for so it was
done by <hi>Theodore,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury;</hi>
by <hi>Theodulphus</hi> of <hi>Orleans;
Isaac Lingonensis, Chrodegangus, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rardus,
Hincmarus,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Egbert</hi>
was not only a great Man, Brother
to the King of the <hi>Northumbrians,</hi> but
a great Promoter of Learning and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:100520:110"/>
Ecclesiastical Discipline,<note place="margin">Egbert. Dial. de Eccles. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stit. cum Bedae Epistol. ad Egbert. <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> 1664.</note> as appears by

the other by <hi>Alcuin</hi>'s Epistles about
him, and <hi>Bede</hi>'s Epistle to him a
little before his death. And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
between the Capitulars and
these Canons, might come from <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuin</hi>'s
carrying them over into <hi>France</hi>
with him.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Saxon Canons,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Concil. Angl. 1. 600.</note> 
               <hi>c.</hi> 24. it is
said, that the Lord's Day on which
our Saviour rose from the dead, is to
be devoted wholly to the Service of
God, excepting only Works of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
and Charity.</p>
            <p>These Canons are translated from
those of <hi>Theodulphus,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,
A. D.</hi> 786. And it is observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that as the Christian Religion
prevailed in these <hi>Northern</hi> Parts, so
the Religious Observation of the
Lord's Day was enforced, as appears
by the Canons of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church,
as well as this. As in the famous
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:100520:111"/>
Canon of the Council of <hi>Mascon, A. D.
585.</hi> where the Bishops Assembled,
complain of the Neglect of the
Lord's Day, and agree to put the
People upon a stricter Observance
of it. And so before in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Orleans, A. D.</hi> 538. But in both
these Canons they avoid a <hi>Iewish</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
as well as profane Neglect.
They allowed both Works of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
and Conveniency, and did
not place the Observation in a bare
Rest, but in Attendance on the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God; and forbad all manner
of Secular Imployments which were
inconsistent with it. Nay, <hi>Theodul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>
his Canon goes higher, <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tummodo
Deo vacandum,</hi> the whole
Day ought to be spent in Religious
and Charitable Imployments.</p>
            <p>The greatest Men in our <hi>Saxon
Churches</hi> asserted the same.<note place="margin">Bed. T. 7. <hi>p.</hi> 639.</note>
               <hi>Bede</hi> saith,
<hi>That the Apostles appointed the Lord's

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:100520:111"/>
and therein we ought to devote
our selves to the Worship of God; tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum

the same purpose speaks <hi>Alcuin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Alcuin. de Offic <hi>c.</hi> 27.</note> who
was bred up under <hi>Egbert,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop

Heathens objected against the <hi>Iews,</hi>
That they spent one Day in the

the bare Rest to be the Sanctification
of the Day which was commanded;
and the spending any part of it in
the publick Worship, to be volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Devotion. But the better sort
of the <hi>Iews</hi> thought the <hi>Rest</hi> was
appointed for the Knowledge of

the Work of Creation. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
was a Sign between God and
the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> as it is often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in Scripture; and the other was
a Commemorative Sign, but such as
excited them to the Worship of the
Creator; and therefore the <hi>Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
Sabbath,</hi> as <hi>Bede</hi> observes, was
of a spiritual Nature. And such a
spiritual Sabbath,<note place="margin">Aug. c. Faust. <hi>l. 6. c.</hi> 4. c. Adimant. <hi>c.</hi> 2. 16.</note> as S. <hi>Augustin</hi> calls

as well as in spiritual and holy
Thoughts.<note place="margin">Epist. ad Ian. 119. <hi>c.</hi> 13.</note> But the <hi>Iewish</hi> Sabbath,

<hi>Bede</hi> followed his Doctrine here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
and that of <hi>Gregory</hi> I. who was
the great Instrument of promoting
the Conversion of our Ancestors to

fully, both as to the Cessation
of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Sabbath, and the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Observation of the Lord's day.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:100520:113"/>
It seems there were some then, as
there are among us now, who were
for the strict Observation of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday-Sabbath.</hi>
               <note place="margin">

They might as well insist upon <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision</hi>

on the Lord's day to abstain from

our selves unto Prayers, that we may
make some Amends for the Weeks

Day. And this devoting the Lord's

into the Body of the Canon Law; and

it, by distinguishing,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:100520:113"/>
1. Works servile materially and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,

            <p>2. Acts spiritual materially and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,

and these we ought to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
upon with Care and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
            <p>3. Acts not servile in themselves,
but done for a servile End, as Studies
and Designs for Gain.</p>
            <p>4. Acts servile in themselves, but
not so in their End; as the Man's
taking up his Couch on the Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
whom Christ cured.</p>
            <p>He affirms, that there is a Moral
Part in the Fourth Commandment,
which, he saith, is <hi>a spiritual Rest,</hi> or
a Time set apart for God's Service:
Which he takes from <hi>Aquinas,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aquin. in Sent. <hi>l.</hi> 3. Dist. 37. Qu. 1. Art. 2.</note> who
saith the Substance of the Command
is Moral; but he doth not make it
to be One day in Seven, but some
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:100520:114"/>
determinate time, which, he saith,
the Church may appoint; but then
it must be imployed in the Service of
God (<hi>vacare rebus divinis</hi>) as things
were said to be sanctified under the
Law,<note place="margin">2. 2. 122. 4.</note> which were applied to God's
Service. But notwithstanding this
Judgment of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> some great
Men in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have
thought One day in Seven, Moral;
and that the Proportion which God
himself had appointed, cannot be
lessened. For altho' Mankind could
not by natural Reason find out the
Proportion, yet being once revealed,
it doth not cease to oblige, unless
something figurative and symbolical,<note place="margin">

            <p>

of the Institution of the Lord's day,<note place="margin">Bell de Cultu Sanct. <hi>l. 3. c.</hi> 11.</note>
because God's Law required that One
day in Seven should be set apart for
the Worship of God; but the Apostles
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:100520:114"/>
thought it not fit to observe the <hi>Iewish</hi>
Sabbath, and therefore changed it
into the Lord's day.</p>

               <hi>Covarruvias</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Covarruv. Car. Resol. <hi>l. 4. c.</hi> 19.</note> That all Divines

Law doth exact for ever.</p>
            <p>But what is meant by this Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of One day in Seven? If it
be understood according to the old
Canons, it will fill scrupulous Minds
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:100520:116"/>
with more Doubts and Fears about
the right Observation of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Origen</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Orig. in Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Hom. 23. <hi>c.</hi> 28.</note> The Observation of
the Christian Sabbath lies in these
things; 1. A Forbearance of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Business. 2. Attendance on the
Publick Worship. 3. Divine Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
on Things invisible and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<hi>Haec est observatio Sabbati Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiani.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hom. 9. in Levit. 16.</note>
And in another place, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
besides Publick Worship,
private Meditation and Reading the
Holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> insists very much
upon the same in several places,<note place="margin">Chrysost. Hom. 5. in Matth.</note> and
on different Occasions.<note place="margin">2 Hom. in Ioh. Hom. 5. ad Pop. Antioch.</note> And altho'
it be in his popular Sermons,<note place="margin">Hom. 10. in Gen.</note> yet
he would certainly not put them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any thing, but what he thought
very fit to be done. And they must
have a mean Opinion of him, who
think his Eloquence carried him too
far in this matter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:100520:116"/>
I shall conclude with the Opinion
of <hi>Lyndwood,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Officio Archipresbyt. v. <hi>Sanctifices.</hi>
               </note> a Learned and Judicious
Canonist; and he observes a Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Sanctification of the Lord's day.
1. By Abstinence from Sin, which is
necessary at all times. 2. By Absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
from such bodily Labours as
hinder the Mind's Attendance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God's Service. 3. By the whole
Imployment of our Minds in Divine
Matters; and this he calls the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Observation of it.</p>
            <p>These things I have the more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
insisted upon, to shew, That the
Religious Observation of the Lord's
day, is no Novelty started by some
late Sects and Parties among us, but
that it hath been the general Sense
of the best part of the Christian
World, and is particularly inforced
upon us of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
not only by the Homilies, but by
the most ancient Ecclesiastical Law
among us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:100520:117"/>
But this is not all, for the Ancient
as well as Modern Canons require
the Observation of Holy-days like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
The Canons of <hi>Egbert</hi> require
not only Prayers, but Preaching then,
<hi>Can.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
            <p>The Council of <hi>Cloveshoo, Can.</hi> 13.
distinguishes the Holy-days relating
to our Saviour, from the rest; and
saith, They are to be observed in a
solemn and uniform Manner, and
the rest according to the <hi>Roman Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrology;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Alcuin. de Offic. <hi>c.</hi> 40.</note>
Which, I suppose, were those
repeated then in the Diptychs of the
Church;<note place="margin">Wilt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Leod.</hi> c. 8.</note> than in other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
but it was generally disused
before the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great.</p>
            <p>The Custom in <hi>Rome,</hi> in <hi>Gregory</hi>'s
time, was to observe the Saints
Days with the solemn Service at one
Church, as appears by his <hi>Homilies</hi>
on the Evangelists, which were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them preached on those Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:100520:117"/>
as of S. <hi>Felicitas, Hom</hi> 3. S. <hi>Agnes,
Hom.</hi> 11, 12. S. <hi>Felix, Hom.</hi> 13. S.
<hi>Pancrace, Hom.</hi> 27. &amp;c. and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
who were <hi>Roman</hi> Martyrs;
and therefore had a particular So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
appointed for them. But
as to other Saints Days, it appears
by the <hi>Antiphonarius</hi> and <hi>Sacramentary</hi>
of <hi>Gregory I.</hi> that they had particular
Anthems and Collects proper for
them in the Offices of the Day; but
I do not find that the Generality of
the People were so strictly tied up,
when the Offices were over, as they
were on the Lord's days, and the
greater Festivals relating to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.
In the Council of <hi>Cloveshoo,
Can.</hi> 13. I observe, that the <hi>Natalitia
Sanctorum,</hi> i.e. the Anniversary Saints
Days, were observed with particular
Psalmody and Anthems; and <hi>Can.
17.</hi> the Days of <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Augustin,</hi>
the Two great Instruments of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
the Nation, were only to be
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:100520:118"/>
kept as Holy-days by the Clergy,
without any particular Obligation
on all the People. So that the Holy-days
of strict Observation then, seem
to have been no other than those
which relate to our Saviour, called
<hi>Dominicae Dispensationis in carne Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitates;</hi>
the rest had some proper
Offices which were performed on
their Days; but the People were to
attend them, as well as they could;
but after there was not this strictness
required, as upon the greater Holy-days;
and as it was in the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> afterwards, when they made
the Obligation of Conscience to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to all Holy-days appointed by
the Church. But it is observable,
(1.) That this Obligation is taken
from those Canons which mention
only the Lord's day, as appears by
<hi>Bellarmin.</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Cultu Sanct. <hi>l.</hi> 3. c. 10.</note> (2.) That they kept up
the Distinction of greater and lesser
Holy-days. (3.) That they allow
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:100520:118"/>
the Bishop to dispense, as to some
Works on Holy-days.<note place="margin">De Feriis, <hi>f.</hi> 52.</note> 
               <hi>Lyndwood</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,
that the Abstinence from
Work is not alike, but as the Church
hath required it; and that if a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's
Licence cannot be had, a less
will serve. Our Church, <hi>Can.</hi> 13.
requires Holy-days to be observed
with Works of Piety, Charity, and
Sobriety; but gives no Rule as to
Abstinence from Works, or the strict
Obligation of Conscience.</p>
            <p>2. I now come to the particular
Duties of the Clergy on the Days
which are solemnly devoted to the
Service of God.</p>
            <p>1. The constant and devout At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
upon, and solemn Reading
the Prayers of the Church, as they are
appointed.<note place="margin">Concil. Angl. <hi>I.</hi> 247.</note> In the old <hi>Saxon Canons</hi>
the Presbyters are required to officiate
constantly at Prayers in their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
so in the Council at <hi>Cloveshoo;
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:100520:119"/>
Can.</hi> 8. the Canons of <hi>Egbert, Can.</hi> 2.
Canons of <hi>Edgar, Can.</hi> 45.</p>
            <p>But how if the People will not
come to the Prayers? You ought,
what lies in you, to remove the
Causes of such Neglect; which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises
generally from these things;
either a gross Stupidity and Regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness
of Religion, which is too
common in the World, or from
Prejudice and Principles of Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or the Interest of a Party; or
from not Reading the Prayers with
that Attention and Devotion which
is fit to raise an Esteem of them.
The other two, you ought to do
what you can to remove; but this
is your own Fault if you do it not.
We are not to please the Fancies of
People by an affected Variety of
Expressions in Prayers; but we ought
to do what we can to excite their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
which is done as much by
the due manner of Reading, as by
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:100520:119"/>
Figures in Speaking. And the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are uneasie at staying, when they
see the Minister read them so fast, as
though he minded nothing so much
as to be at the end of them; or when
he mangles them so, as if he had a
mind to make the People out of
love with them.</p>
            <p>2. The next Duty is Preaching;
and truly that need to be looked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
when the Esteem of our Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
depends so much upon it. We
have none of those Methods which
those on both sides make so much
use of; we can neither comply with
the People in Gestures, and Phrases,
and Enthusiastick Heats, nor with
the Superstitious Devotions and
Priest-craft of others. Of all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
ours hath the least Reason to be
charged with it, since they let go so
many Advantages over the People
by the Reformation. Thanks be to
God, we have Scripture, and Reason,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:100520:120"/>
and Antiquity of our side; but these
are dry and insipid things to the
common People, unless some Arts
be used to recommend them. But
since our main Support lies in the
Honesty and Justice of our Cause,
without Tricks and Devices, we
ought to look very well to that part
of our Profession which keeps up any
Reputation among the People; and
that is Preaching. Those who are so
weak or lazy, as to be glad to have
that laid aside too, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
never well considered the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of our Profession, or the way
to support it. It's true, for some
time Preaching was an extraordinary
thing in the Church; and none but
Great and Eloquent Men of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in the Church were permitted
to preach, and the greatest Bishops
were then the Preachers, as appears
by the Sermons of S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> S.
<hi>Chrysostom,</hi> S. <hi>Augustin,</hi> &amp;c. And even
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:100520:120"/>
some of the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<hi>Sozomen</hi> saith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Soz.</hi> l. 7. c. 19.</note> were frequent
Preachers, as appears by <hi>Gregory</hi>'s
Homilies on <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and the <hi>Gospels.</hi>
And if it were not then practised he
did very ill to complain of the
Burden of it,<note place="margin">Regest. <hi>l.</hi> 1. 24.</note> and the Danger of
neglecting it. But in other Churches
while the Bishop and the Presbyters
lived together, before parochial Cures
were settled, the Presbyters had no
constant Office of preaching, but as
the Bishops appointed them occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.
But afterwards, when the
Presbyters were fixed in their Cures,
they were required to be very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and careful in preaching, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing
the people committed to
their Charge, as may be seen in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
early Canons of the <hi>Gallican</hi>
Church;<note place="margin">Concil. Vasens. 2. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> and so it was here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Turon. 3. <hi>c.</hi> 17. Arel. 6. <hi>c.</hi> 10. Capitul. 1. 160.</note>

               <note place="margin">Reginold. 1. 205.</note> 
               <hi>Can.</hi> 3. and that not only in
the moving way in the Pulpit,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Capit.</hi> 11. c. 5.</note> but
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:100520:121"/>
in the familiar and instructing way,
which we call <hi>Catechizing; Concil.
Cloveshoo, c. 11. Can. Egbert.</hi> 6. Both
ought to be done, because they are
both very useful. The Principles
and Foundations of Religion must be
well laid, to make the people have
any Taste or Relish of preaching;
otherwise it is like reading Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks
to those who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
not Numbers or Figures. <hi>Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
observes,<note place="margin">Erasm. Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat. ad Eccles.</note> that the Sense of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
grows very cold without
preaching; and that the Countess of
<hi>Richmond,</hi> Mother to <hi>H.</hi> 7. had such
a Sense of the Necessity of it in those
times, that she maintained many
Preachers at her own Charges, and
imployed Bishop <hi>Fisher</hi> to find out
the best qualified for it. And since
the Reformation the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> hath been more sensible of
the Necessity of it, as appears by the
Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sess. 24. c. 4. de Reform.</note> Cardinal <hi>Borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meo,</hi>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:100520:121"/>
one of the most Celebrated
Saints since that time, frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
upon it, gives Directions about
it, and speaks of it as a thing, which
tends very much to the Glory of
God, and the Salvation of Souls.
And to the same purpose other Great
Men among them,<note place="margin">Act. Eccles. Mediol. 44<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Would it not then be a great Shame
for us,<note place="margin">

and the true Religion,<note place="margin">Godeau sur les Ordres, <hi>p.</hi> 458.</note> to
neglect or lessen the Reputation of
those things which our Adversaries
have learnt from us,<note place="margin">Bordenave des Eglis. Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral. <hi>p.</hi> 670.</note> and glory in
them; and those are Diligence in
<hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Catechizing?</hi> Which
none can despise who value Religion,
none can neglect who have any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the Interest or Honour of
their Profession.</p>
            <p>3. The next Duty is the solemn
Administration of the Sacraments,
which ought to be done in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:100520:122"/>
Assemblies, where there is not
a great Reason to the contrary. The
<hi>Saxon Canons</hi> are express, That Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
unless in Case of Necessity,
should be administred only in due
Times and Places, <hi>Egber. Can. 10,
11.</hi> While the Ancient Discipline
was kept up,<note place="margin">Tertul. de Baptis. <hi>c.</hi> 19.</note> and Baptism only cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
at the great Festivals,<note place="margin">Leo Ep. 78.</note> there
was a Necessity of its being publick;<note place="margin">Ambros. Serm. 61.</note>
and the Catechumens underwent se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Scrutinies,<note place="margin">Theodulph. de Ordine Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note> which lasted several
days in the Face of the Church,<note place="margin">Alcuin. de Bapt. Cerem. <hi>p.</hi> 1151.</note> as
S. <hi>Augustin</hi> observes,<note place="margin">August. de Symbol. ad Catech. <hi>l. 2. c.</hi> 1.</note> after they had
been kept under private Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for some time before.<note place="margin">De Fide &amp; Oper. <hi>c.</hi> 6.</note> But when
whole Nations were not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,<note place="margin">August. Serm. 160.</note>
but Infants generally bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
the former Method of Discipline
was changed. But yet the Church
retained her Right as to Satisfaction
about the due Admission of her
Members. And that is the true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why, after private Baptism,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:100520:122"/>
the Child is required to be brought
to the publick Congregation. For
Baptism is not intended to be done
before a select Number of Witnesses,
but in the Face of the Church, which
is the regular and solemn Way;
however, the Bishop may dispense
in some particular Cases, which he
judges reasonable. At first Baptism
was administred publickly, as Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
served, by Rivers; as <hi>Bede</hi>
saith, <hi>Paulinus baptized many in the
Rivers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bed.</hi> l. 2. c. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> 
               <hi>before Oratories or Churches were
built.</hi> Afterwards the <hi>Baptistery</hi> was
built at the Entrance of the Church,
or very near it; which is mentioned
by <hi>Athanasius,</hi> S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi>
S. <hi>Augustin,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Baptiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
then had a large Bason in it,
which held the Persons to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
and they went down by Steps
into it. Afterwards when Immersion
came to be disused, Fonts were set
up at the Entrance of Churches:
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:100520:123"/>
But still the place was publick. But
in Case of Necessity there is a Form
prescribed; and I do not see how
any, without leave, can use the Form
of Publick Baptism in private Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
which is against both our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and Modern Canons. In the
<hi>Greek</hi> Church it is Deprivation to
do it;<note place="margin">Concil. in Trullo, Can. 31, 59.</note> and the Synod under <hi>Photius</hi>
confirms it, both as to the <hi>Eucharist</hi>
and <hi>Baptism,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Syn. A. &amp; B. Can. 12.</note> because publick Order
is to be preserved. But it is there
understood to be done in Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Bishop's Authority, whose
Consent may make the Case diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
if they judge it reasonable. But
Ministerial Officers are not Judges
in an equitable Case against a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Rule.</p>
            <p>4. Another Duty of the parochial
Clergy is, to be able and ready to
resolve Penitential Cases, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to the Internal Court of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and not the External and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:100520:123"/>
Court, which respects the
Honour of the Church, as to scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
Offences committed by the
Members of it. And this takes in
the <hi>Private</hi> and <hi>Occasional</hi> Duties of
the parochial Clergy; for they ought
to inform themselves of the Spiritual
Condition of their People, that they
may be able to give suitable Advice
and Directions to them both in
Health and Sickness: But chiefly to
be able to give them safe and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Advice under Troubles of
Conscience by reason of wilful Sins.
<hi>Duarenus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Duaren. de Benef. <hi>l. 2. c.</hi> 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Clergy, as to the Cure of Souls, lies
in the Power of Binding and Loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
<hi>i. e.</hi> in dealing aright with the
Consciences of Men, as to the Guilt
of their Sins. And the Rules of the
Penitential Court, are different from
those of the Ecclesiastical Court, as
well as the End is different. In the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:100520:124"/>
               <hi>Saxon</hi> times, there were both here.
There were Ecclesiastical Law which

            </p>
            <p>But there were many Cases which
were not publick,<note place="margin">L. L. Canut. <hi>c.</hi> 22, 23.</note> and yet great Care
was to be used,<note place="margin">L. L. Edmund. Cap. 4.</note> as to the Direction
of Penitents, as appears by the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentials
of <hi>Theodore</hi> and <hi>Bede</hi> in the
<hi>Saxon</hi> times.<note place="margin">Theod. Capit. <hi>c.</hi> 13.</note> Whereby we learn that
a Difference was to be observed, as
to the Nature of Offences, and the
Circumstances of Persons and Actions,
and the Measure of Contrition;
and the particular Method is set down
in the penitential Books,<note place="margin">Regino I, 300.</note> which was
in very material Circumstances diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from the Methods used in the
Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But it is a thing
necessary for every parochial Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
to be able to settle doubting
Consciences, and to put them into
the best Methods of avoiding Sin

for the future, without which the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of the Priest signifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
For where God doth not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve,
the Church cannot.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Giving a good Example to the
People committed to your Charge.
This is often mentioned in the</hi> Saxon
<hi>Canons: Council at</hi> Cloveshoo, c. 8.
<hi>Canons of</hi> Egbert, 14, 15, 18, 19,

and put them into God's.</p>
            <p>6. Lastly the Performance of all these
Duties supposes a constant Residence
among your People; without which
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:100520:125"/>
it is impossible to discharge them
in such a manner, as to give them
and your selves full Satisfaction.
This, I am sensible, is a very nice
and tender Point; and the Difficulties
of it do arise from these things: On
one side it is said,</p>
            <p>1. That there is an Allowance
by the Law given to several Persons
to hold more Benefices than one;
and since the Distribution of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
is not by the Law of God, but
by the Law of the Land, what Fault
is there in making use of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
which the Law gives? But
there cannot be constant Residence in
more Places than one.</p>
            <p>2. That the general Service of
the Church is more to be preferred
than taking Care of a particular Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish;
because the necessary Duties
of a Parish may be supplied by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
approved by the Bishop, and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:100520:125"/>
a single Living seldom affords a
sufficient Competency for persons to
be capable of publick Service.</p>
            <p>3. That the way of Subsistence
for the Clergy, is now much altered
from what it was when Celibacy
was enjoyned. For a Competency
was always supposed where Residence
was strictly required; and what was
a Competency to a single person, is
not so to a Family.</p>
            <p>4. That the Church hath a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Relaxing the Severity of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Canons from the different Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of things; and when the
general Good of the Church may
be more promoted therein; as in
the Removal of Clergymen from
one Diocess to another, and the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Bishops.</p>
            <p>5. That the Case is now very
different, as to Dispensations, from
what it was in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as
to the Number of Benefices, and the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:100520:126"/>
manner of obtaining them; that a
great Restraint is laid by our Laws
upon Pluralities, and our own Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan
is the Judge when they
are fit to be granted.</p>
            <p>But on the other side it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,</p>
            <p>1. That in the first Constitution
of parochial Churches, every Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
was bound to a strict Residence;
so in the Canons of <hi>Egbert, Can.</hi> 25.
Presbyters are said to be settled in
those Churches, which had a House
and Glebe belonging to them; and
many Canons were then expresly
made, That no Person should have
more than one Church; and it is
said in the Capitulars,<note place="margin">Capit. <hi>l. 6. c.</hi> 73, 75.</note> that this had
been several times decreed.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Addit.</hi> 2. c. 10.</note> And so

After a solemn Disputation at <hi>Paris,</hi>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:100520:127"/>
it was determined against Pluralities,
if one Benefice be sufficient; and
all the Divines joyned with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
therein, except two; so that it
seemed to be the current Opinion of
the Learned and Pious Men of that
Time.<note place="margin">Aquin. Quaest. Quodlibet.</note> 
               <hi>Aquinas</hi> saith, <hi>It is a doubtful
Point,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Q. 9. Art. 15. Caj. ad 2. 2. q. 185. R. 5.</note> but <hi>Cajetan</hi> is positive against
them. So that all the Zeal against
Pluralities, is not to be imputed to
the Piques of the Friars against the
Secular Clergy; although there is no
Question but they were so much the
more earnest in it; but in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Trent</hi> the Bishops of <hi>Spain</hi> were
the most zealous, as to the Point of
Residence, and the Friars against it,
as appears by <hi>Catharinus</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>2. Setting aside all Authorities,
the Argument in Point of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
seems the strongest against
Non-residence; because persons have
voluntarily undertaken the Cure of
Souls within such Limits; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:100520:127"/>
the Bounds be fixed by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Authority, yet since he hath
undertaken such a Charge personally,
knowing those Bounds, it lies upon
his Conscience to discharge the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
incumbent upon him, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be done without constant Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
as the Magistrates are bound
in Conscience to do their Duty, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Bounds are settled by
Human Laws: And so in the case
of Property, Human Laws bind so
that it is a Sin to invade what is settled
by them. And if it be left to a Man's
Conscience, whether a Man answers
his Obligation more by personal
Attendance, or by a Curate; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Honour of Religion, and the
Good of Souls be more promoted,
and the Peace of his own Mind
secured by one or the other, it is
no hard matter to judge on which
side it must go. It is impossible to
defend all the Arguments used in the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:100520:128"/>
old Canons against Pluralities, as
that Polygamy is unlawful under
the Gospel: So that, <hi>as a Bishop hath
but one City, and a Man but one Wife,
so a Presbyter ought to have but
one Church: That no Man can serve two
Masters,</hi> &amp;c. but all their Reasons
were not of this sort. For, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Toledo</hi> speaks home,<note place="margin">Concil. Tolet. 16. <hi>c.</hi> 5. C. 10. Q. 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</note> 
               <hi>That one
Man cannot perform his Duty to more
than one Charge.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Concil. Paris. 6. <hi>c.</hi> 49.</note> To the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Sixth Council at <hi>Paris;</hi> and
withal, <hi>That it brings a Scandal on the
Christian Church, and an Hinderance to
Publick Worship, and the Good of Souls,
and savours too much of a worldly Mind;</hi>
which are weighty Arguments.</p>
            <p>The only considerable thing on
the other side, is, <hi>That the Bishops are
to take care that the Places be duly
supplied; but whether it be done by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
Vicar or Curate, is not material.</hi>
But this will not hold. For, (1.) the
Care of Souls is committed personal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:100520:128"/>
to him that doth undertake it.
And a Regard is had to the Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of the Person for such a Trust,
by the Patron that presents, and
the Bishop who admits and institutes
the Person so qualified. (2.) The
old Canons were very strict as to
personal Residence,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Capit.</hi> l. 5. c. 108.</note> so as to fix them
in their Cures from which they could
not go away when they pleased,
which they called <hi>Promissionem stabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis.</hi>
Our <hi>Saxon</hi> Canons are clear, as
to the personal Cure, <hi>Can. Egbert. 1. 4,
6. Populo sibi commisso;</hi> and no Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
could leave his Cure and go to
another only for Honour or Profit,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Capit.</hi> l. 6. c. 200. l. 7. c. 245.</note>
               <hi>Can.</hi> 13. And none could go from
one Bishop to another, without his
Diocesan's Leave, <hi>Concil. Herudford.
c. 5. Egbert. de Eccles. Instit. p. 97,
100.</hi> And when the Bishop gives In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
he commits the Care of
Souls to the Incumbent, and not
meerly the Care that Divine Offices
be there performed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:100520:129"/>
               <hi>But yet it is well observed by</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas,
<hi>That</hi> if the having more Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
than one were a thing evil in it self,
it could in no case be dispensed with;
but there are some Actions which in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
are irregular, yet in some cases may
be justified; especially, if they be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
as to Publick Service and Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to the same purpose <hi>Cajetan</hi>
speaks;<note place="margin">Cajet. Sum. <hi>V.</hi> Benef. 1. 6.</note> but he saith, <hi>The Cases that
make it lawful, must relate to a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and not a Private Good;</hi> but he
mentions these things which excuse
from Residence;<note place="margin">In. 2. 2. q. 185. R. 5.</note> 1. <hi>Lawful Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
as to Health, <hi>&amp;c. 2. Publick
Service.</hi> And others say, a <hi>Geometrical
Proportion</hi> ought to be observed in the
Distribution of Ecclesiastical Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
and not an <hi>Arithmetical,</hi> i. e. A
Regard ought to be had to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
and Capacities of Persons;<note place="margin">Filliuc. Tr. 41. <hi>c. 7. n.</hi> 6.</note> as a
Commander hath more Pay than
many common Souldiers; but this
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:100520:129"/>
reaches only to the Value, and not
to the Number of Benefices.</p>
            <p>But the Question still remains,
Whether a Legal Dispensation take
not off the Obligation in Point of
Conscience, since it is allowed by
Law, and the Curate appointed by
the Bishop, who committed the
Cure of Souls to him?</p>
            <p>In answer to this, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,</p>
            <p>1. That the Law proposes in Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations
very allowable Ends, as
<hi>Publick Service, Incouragement of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Reward of Merit;</hi> and therefore
<hi>Doctors by Favour</hi> have not the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
which others have; and in case
of <hi>Incompetency,</hi> as it was then judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
no Legal Dispensation was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p>2. Some Ancient Canons took
care of the Supply of the Place by
competent Persons, and in that case
abated the Rigour of the Canon. For
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:100520:130"/>
               <hi>Sirmondus</hi> saith in the Canon of the
Council of <hi>Nantz,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Concil. Nanet. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note> against Pluralities,
this Clause was added, <hi>Unless he hath
Presbyters under him to supply the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of his Place:</hi> And the same Clause
is in <hi>Regino,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Regino Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit. Art. 46.</note> 
               <hi>l. 1. c.</hi> 254. and <hi>Regino</hi>
puts it among the <hi>Articles of Enquiry,</hi>
as to the Clergy,<note place="margin">Baluz. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. ad Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. 604, 608, 612.</note> 
               <hi>If any had more
Churches than one without Presbyters
to assist him.</hi> And in their old <hi>Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition</hi>
to them at <hi>Visitations</hi> it is to
the same purpose, but in others it
is left out.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Thomassin,</hi> Part. 3. c. 42. n. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Thomassin</hi> is of Opinion,
That the former Enquiry related to
those who had <hi>Chapels,</hi> and not to
more <hi>Churches;</hi> because then there
were none that had Titles upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others
Benefice; but these Words are
express as to more Churches. It's true,
there were no such <hi>Titles</hi> then; for
a <hi>Title</hi> in the old Canon Law, was
the Relation which a Clergyman
stood in to the Bishop of his Diocess,
being one of his Clergy; and so the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:100520:130"/>
               <hi>Greek Canonists</hi> understand a Man's
not being ordained <hi>without a Title,
and not having two Churches; i. e.</hi> not
to have Relation to two <hi>Diocesses,</hi> and
so <hi>sine Titulo,</hi> is without being own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by some Bishop; and this was
that which they thought ought to
be strictly observed;<note place="margin">Can. Apost. 19.</note> and to which
purpose many Canons were made,<note place="margin">Nicen. <hi>c.</hi> 16.</note>
both ancient and later;<note place="margin">Antioch. 3.</note> and if any
deserted their Bishop,<note place="margin">Laodic. 42.</note> they were liable

               <hi>Title,</hi> came to be applied to
parochial Churches;<note place="margin">Cresc. Coll. Tit. 17.</note> but there were
some who found out,<note place="margin">Concil. Herudf, <hi>c.</hi> 5.</note> that the
Ancient Canons had another Sense.<note place="margin">Can. Edgar. 8. Egbert. Can. 13.</note>
Thence in the Council of <hi>Placentia</hi>

                  </gap>. <hi>c.</hi> 175.</note>
it was decreed, <hi>That one might have
two Churches in the same Diocess, but
not two Preferments in several Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals.</hi>
And in the Council of <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,
A. D.</hi> 1095. the Reason is given,
<hi>because according to the Canons no Man
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:100520:131"/>
could have-two Titles;</hi> and every one
was bound to hold to the <hi>Title</hi> to
which he was first ordained. But
after all,<note place="margin">Concil. Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note> the Council of <hi>Nantz</hi> shews
plainly, that more parochial <hi>Titles</hi>
were then allowed, if well provided
for, by such persons as the Bishop of
the Diocess approved. Now this
very much alters the State of the
case; for then the Obligation is <hi>Real,</hi>
and not <hi>Personal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. It was agreed by the Ancient
Canons,<note place="margin">Concil. Tolet. 16. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</note> That where there was an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competency
of Maintenance,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>C.</hi> 10. Q. 3. c. Vnio.</note> they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
an Union for support; now
that is but the Bishop's Act in joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what had been divided, supposing
a sufficient Subsistence: And a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Distance with the Bishop's
Allowance, hath the same Equity;
<hi>i.e.</hi> the Bishop's Act may unite two
small Benefices for a Support, not by
a perpetual Union, but so long as
he sees cause, which our Law doth
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:100520:131"/>
still allow, under such a Value. But
it is rather a Dispensation than an
Union; for the Rights continue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct.
In the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> there
were Prerogative Unions <hi>ad Vitam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Compegins de Vnion. <hi>n. 1, 8, 10, &amp;c.</hi>
               </note>
which were very scandalous, and are
owned by the best Canonists to be
destructive of all Order,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Azor.</hi> p. 2. l. 6. c. 28.</note> and invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to defeat the Canons against Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities.<note place="margin">Flam. Paris. de Resign. <hi>l. 12. c. 3. n.</hi> 49.</note>
But the Unions which the
Law allows, are only those where
two distinct Benefices are made one
for a competent Subsistence; and
then if the Union be reasonable, the
Dispensation within due Distance is so
too. <hi>Balsamon</hi> saith, <hi>In the</hi> Greek
<hi>Church Pluralities are not forbidden, if
they be near, and under the same Bishop;</hi>
but they did not allow the same
Man to be under two Bishops. In
the <hi>Capitulars</hi> that Clause is added,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Addit.</hi> 2. n. 10.</note>
That no Man shall have more Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
than one, <hi>si Facultas suppetit,</hi> if
it affords a reasonable Subsistence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:100520:132"/>
And therefore in case of Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency
of Maintenance, of a good
Provision for Curates, and of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Service, the Severity of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Canons is with Reason abated,
and a person is supposed to undertake
the Cure, with those Measures which
the Law and Canons allow. But
every Man who regards the doing
his Duty out of Conscience, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
how much lies upon himself;
and that the original Intention of the
Church and Laws, was, That no
Man should undertake more than he
was willing and ready to discharge,
as far as one Man's Abilities could go.
For, in great Cities, one great Parish
requires more than several Churches
in the Countrey; and in such Cases
an equitable Construction must be
put upon such Canons, which require
personal performance of these Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>

for those who were to attend the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:100520:133"/>
Service of that Church. And in the
Acts of Consecration of a parochial
Church in <hi>Baluzius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Baluz. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. ad Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginon. <hi>p.</hi> 622.</note> the Bishop in
the first place declares himself satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the Endowment, <hi>unde dignè
domus Dei sustentaretur.</hi> And upon
this the <hi>Original Right of Patronage</hi>
was founded,<note place="margin">Ent. de Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. aedific. c. ad Audien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium.</note> not upon <hi>the Soil,</hi>
which gave no Title, where there
was not a Church built and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a competent Subsistence.
So that all <hi>Advowsons</hi> or <hi>Rights</hi> of
<hi>Presentation</hi> in private <hi>Patrons,</hi> were
at first <hi>Appendant</hi> to Manors, and not
<hi>in Gross;</hi> because the Right came
from the Endowment out of the
Manor: And the Name of <hi>Patron</hi>
in the Sense of the <hi>Feudal Law,</hi> is the
same with Lord of the Fee, and so
<hi>Beneficium</hi> is a <hi>Feudal</hi> Term; and till
the <hi>Feudal Law</hi> prevailed, the Name
of <hi>Patrom</hi> is rarely used in this Sense.
And when it came to be used, the
<hi>Patrons</hi> in <hi>France</hi> would have brought
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:100520:134"/>
those who had their <hi>Benefices</hi> to a
kind of <hi>Feudal Service,</hi> and to have
received <hi>Investiture</hi> from them. This
Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> drives at,<note place="margin">Seld. 85, 86.</note> as though the
<hi>Patrons</hi> had the Right of Investiture
belonging to them, because some
such Practice is often complained of
in the <hi>French</hi> Canons, and as often
condemned, not meerly by Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Canons, but by as good Laws
as any were then made. It cannot
be denied that bad Practices are the
Occasion of making good Laws;
but doth it follow that those
Practices which were against Law,
were the Law of that time? Yet
this is Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s way of Arguing;
he grants,<note place="margin">F. 89.</note> 
               <hi>That there were Laws made,
but they were little obeyed.</hi> Must we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
conclude those illegal Practices to
have been the standing Law, and
the Laws themselves to be illegal?
There were two things aimed at by
those <hi>Patrons.</hi> 1. To keep the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:100520:134"/>
in a sole Dependance on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
witout Regard to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's
Authority. 2. To make
such Bargains with them as they
thought fit. Both these were thought
necessary to be redressed by Laws,
since the Canons were slighted by
them. And if the Practice be good
against Law in one case, why not
in the other also? Why is not <hi>Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
justified, as well as the <hi>Patron</hi>'s
absolute Power over the Incumbents?
but the Laws were severe against
both. For in the time of <hi>Lud. Pius,
A. D.</hi> 816. there was a solemn As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
of the Estates of the Empire,
where several Ecclesiastical Laws
were passed, and among the rest,
these two:<note place="margin">Capit. 816. <hi>c.</hi> 9.</note> 1. <hi>That no Presbyters should
be put in,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Capit. 1, 84, 141.</note> 
               <hi>or put out of Churches, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Authority and Consent of the
Bishops; and that the Bishops should not
refuse those who were presented, if they
were</hi> probabilis Vitae &amp; Doctrinae, <hi>i.e.</hi>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:100520:135"/>
such as the Bishops could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
against either for Life or Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
2. <hi>That every Church should
have an entire</hi> Manse <hi>belonging to it,
free from any Feudal Service; but if
they had other Estates of their own, for
them they were to answer to the Lords
of the Manor, as others did.</hi> And from
hence this came into the Collections
of <hi>Ivo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ivo</hi> p. 3. c. 55, 174.</note> 
               <hi>Regino, Burchardus,</hi> and <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi>
and passed for a Law generally
received.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Regino</hi> l. 1. c. 24.</note> As to the former, a new
Sanction was added to it in another
Assembly at <hi>Worms,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Burch.</hi> l. 3. c. 52.</note> 
               <hi>A. D. 829. c.</hi> 1.
and repeated in the <hi>Capitulars,</hi>
               <note place="margin">C. 23. q. 8. c. 24. 25.</note> 
               <hi>l. 5.

to the latter, <hi>l. 5. c. 100. Capit. A.
829. c.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>But it seems there were some still
continued obstinate in their former
Practices, and therefore these Laws
were reinforced in another Assembly,
<hi>A. D.</hi> 869. in the time of <hi>Carolus
Calvus,</hi> who mentions the Laws of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:100520:135"/>
his Father and Grandfather to the
same purpose, <hi>c.</hi> 9. and there takes
notice of the Contrivances made use
of to defeat the Intention of those
Laws; and the bottom of all is there
said to be <hi>abominable Simony.</hi> Which
shews, what it was which these <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons</hi>
aimed at, by claiming <hi>Investi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
without the Bishop. And it
was then judged necessary, that the
Bishop's Consent was required to
prevent this Mischief. But still some
<hi>Patrons</hi> required <hi>Feudal Service</hi> for the
Glebe they had given to the Church;
but the Law commands them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
it free from such Service, <hi>Capit l. 5.
c.</hi> 100.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Concil. Labb.</hi> T. 8. p. 1815.</note> 
               <hi>Addit. l. 4. c.</hi> 98, 163. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
much struggling, <hi>Hinomarus,</hi> who
lived at that time, saith, <hi>That these Laws
were observed.</hi> The <hi>Patron</hi>'s Right by
Virtue of the Endowment, was not
disputed; but an Arbitrary Power, as
to the Incumbents, was utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
them; and they were put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:100520:136"/>
the Bishop's Care, who was to
receive Complaints against them, and
to proceed according to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
Canons. But I am apt to think
that all this stir in <hi>France</hi> did not
arise from the pretence of Original
Donation and Endowment of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
but from the Infeodation of
<hi>Church Lands</hi> and <hi>Titles,</hi> by <hi>Charles
Martel</hi> (as an old <hi>MS.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Filesaci Opus. <hi>p. 846, &amp;c.</hi>
               </note> in <hi>Filesacus</hi>
saith) and others in <hi>France,</hi> whose
Custom it was <hi>to give them in Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
to their Souldiers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Fragment. de Majoribus Pal.</note> who then look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on them as their own,<note place="margin">Du Chesn. T. 1.</note> and were
hardly brought to any reasonable
Allowance for the Clergy which
supplied them. These were called
<hi>Beneficia</hi> in the <hi>Capitulars,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Capit. l. 1. 157.</note> and they
were to pay <hi>Nonae &amp; Decimae,</hi> i.e. a
Fifth Part out of them, which was
obtained with much Difficulty, as
appears by the many Laws made
about them.<note place="margin">Regin. l. 1. 43, 45, 46, 47.</note> In the Council at <hi>Lep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,
A.D. 743. Carolomannus,</hi> son to
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:100520:136"/>
               <hi>Charles Martel,</hi> owns the letting out
some of the Church Lands <hi>sub Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cario
&amp; Censu,</hi> upon a reserved Rent,
<hi>Can. 2. Capit. l. 5. c.</hi> 3. but then it was
barely for Life. But the consequence
was, That it was very hard to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
either the Lands or the reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Rents, and they put in Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and put them out as they
pleased, because they held these Lands
as Beneficiary Tenures from the
Crown. So that it was the Work
of more than an Age to put the
Church there in any tolerable Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But this seems to be very much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken,
when it is brought to prove the
Right of Patronage from the Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as to the Disposal of Benefices.</p>
            <p>But the Right of Patronage by
the first building and endowing the
Church, is owned by the Civil Law
in <hi>Iustinian</hi>'s <hi>Novels, 123. c.</hi> 18. and
Two Things were there required;
1. A sufficient Maintenance for the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:100520:137"/>
Clergy who were nominated. 2. The
Bishop's Satisfaction as to their Fitness;
about which he speaks in another
<hi>Novel, 56. Tit. 12. c.</hi> 2. And he
elsewhere requires, that before any
Churches were built, the Bishop
should see that there were sufficient
Maintenance for those who were to
officiate, <hi>Novel, 66. Tit.</hi> 22.</p>
            <p>The same Right obtained here
upon the same Grounds, as appears
by the Barons Answer to <hi>Gregory</hi> IX.
who affirm, That they had it ever
since Christianity was founded here.
They mean, ever since parochial
Churches were endowed by their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors;
for there could be no such
Right of Patronage before. And
such <hi>Patrons</hi> were here called <hi>Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cati
Ecclesiae,</hi> as appears by <hi>Ioh. Saris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bur.
Ep.</hi> 6. 119. and the <hi>Ius Advoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis,</hi>
as our Lawyers tell us,<note place="margin">1 Inst. 17. b.</note> is a
Right which a Person hath to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to a vacant Benefice in his own
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:100520:137"/>
Name; which is agreeable to what
<hi>Bracton</hi> and <hi>Fleta</hi> had said long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>But it doth not appear by them
how the Names of <hi>Patron</hi> and <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate</hi>
came to be so applied. Among
the <hi>Romans,</hi> saith <hi>Asconius Pedianus,</hi>
the <hi>Patron</hi> was he that pleaded the
cause of another; the <hi>Advocate,</hi> he
that appeared in Court on his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.
But this doth not reach to
the <hi>Ius Advocationis</hi> which we are
now about. In the Ninety seventh
Canon of the <hi>African Code,</hi> an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
is made for the Churches
to have <hi>Advocates</hi> to solicite their
Causes at Court.<note place="margin">Capit. l. 7. c. 392.</note> From hence the
greater Churches and Monasteries had
their proper <hi>Advocates</hi> appointed
them by the King,<note place="margin">Bignon. in Marculph. l. 1. c. 21.</note> as <hi>Bignonius</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves;
and in the old Charters of
<hi>Aub. Miraeus,</hi> several such <hi>Advocates</hi>
are appointed; and it appears to
have been an honorary Title, and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:100520:138"/>
great Men were pleased with it.
<hi>Miraeus</hi> faith,<note place="margin">Aub. Mirae. Cod. Donat. l. 1. c. 136.</note> it was accounted <hi>a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Honour</hi> at that time. And
so by degrees the Founders of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial
Churches came to have the
Title of <hi>Patrons</hi> and <hi>Advocates</hi> of
them; and the Right they injoyed,
the Right of <hi>Advowson</hi> as well as <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage</hi>
(not as some ridiculously
talk of <hi>Advocat se,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. Roverii Reomaus, p. 614.</note> or <hi>Advocat alium)</hi>
because the Trust and Care of those
Churches, endowed by their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors,
was fallen to them, and they
were bound to look after,<note place="margin">De Foro Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet. f. 50. C. 56. q. 7. <hi>n.</hi> 32.</note> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the Rights of them; and so <hi>Lynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>
explains it.</p>
            <p>II. The next thing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
is the <hi>Oblations</hi> of the People,
which in those elder times were so
free and large, that (which may
seem incredible now) there were
Persons who would build Churches
on their own Land to have a Share
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:100520:138"/>
in the Oblations, as is affirmed in
one of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Councils,<note place="margin">Concil. Brac. 3. c. 6.</note> and
there forbidden with great Severity.
It was not,<note place="margin">De Consecr. 1. <hi>c.</hi> 10.</note> as the <hi>Gloss</hi> on the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
Law understands it, to make
a Bargain for the Right of Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,
but it is expressed to have an
equal Share with the Clergy in the
<hi>Oblations</hi> of the People.</p>
            <p>It is observed by <hi>Agabardus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Agabard. de Dispens. c. 20.</note> 
               <hi>That
the Devotion of Persons in the first A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
was so great, that there was no need
to make Laws or Canons for the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
of Churches, since they were so am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
provided for by the Liberality of the
People.</hi> Thence we read of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posita
pietatis</hi> in <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tertul. Apolog. <hi>c.</hi> 39.</note> which were
<hi>voluntary Oblations;</hi> and out of which
were made <hi>Divisiones Mensurnae</hi> in
S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cypr. Ep. 34.</note> and the <hi>Sportulae,</hi> which
were the Allowances made to the
Clergy out of the common Stock;
and they who received them, and
not those who gave them (as Mr.
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:100520:139"/>
               <hi>Selden</hi> fancies) were called <hi>Sportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantes
Fratres;</hi> and the Allowances
were then stiled <hi>Stipes &amp; Oblationes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ep. 66.</note>
which were so considerable, that St.
<hi>Cyprian</hi> blamed some for their setting
their Hearts too much upon them;<note place="margin">Ep. 64.</note>
               <hi>Stipes, Oblationes, Lucra desiderant,
quibus prius insatiabiles incubabant;</hi>
which could not be said of any meer
necessary Subsistence; these they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<hi>tanquam Decimas ex fructibus,</hi>
as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> speaks, in lieu of Tithes at
that time, when the most of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church inhabited the Cities,
and gave out of their Stock to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Church, and those who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
upon the Service of it. But
when Christianity came to spread
into the Countries, then a more fixed
and settled Maintenance was required,
but so as to retain somewhat of the
Ancient Custom in <hi>voluntary Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:100520:139"/>
               <hi>No sooner was Christianity settled
in</hi> France, <hi>but we read of Lands gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the Church by</hi> Clodovaeus <hi>after
his Conversion; these are owned by
the first Council of</hi> Orleans <hi>called in
his time,</hi> A. D. 511. and were put
into the Bishop's Hands, and to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed
by him for Repairs of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
Maintenance of the Clergy, and
other pious Uses, Can. 5. 14, 15. <hi>But
besides these, we read still of</hi> Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<hi>made by the people on the Altar,
both in the</hi> Mother-Church, <hi>and in</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial
Churches. If in the Mother-Church
one Moiety went to the Bishop,
the other to the Clergy; if in the other,
only the third Part to the Bishop.</p>
            <p>In the second Council of <hi>Mascon,
Can.</hi> 4. we find it required, That <hi>all
the People make an Oblation of Bread
and Wine at the Altar;</hi> and this was
<hi>A. D.</hi> 585. but besides, the next Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
insists on the Payment of Tithes,
as founded on <hi>the Law of God,</hi> and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:100520:140"/>
the <hi>Ancient Custom of the Church,</hi> which
is thereby reinforced; <hi>unde statuimus
&amp; decernimus ut mos antiquus repare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur;</hi>
which Words are not fairly left
out by Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Selden</hi> of Tithes, c. 5. n. 5. p. 58.</note> because they shew
that there was only in this Canon
<hi>a renewing of an Ancient Custom,</hi> which
had obtained, but was now grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into Disuse. For this Council
of <hi>Mascon</hi> was called on purpose to
restore what they found too much
declining, as to Religion; and they
begin with the Observation of the
Lord's Day, and after, add this,
wherein they complain of <hi>the Neglect
of that which their Predecessors obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
as founded on the Law of God.</hi>
So that there can be no doubt of
the Custom of paying Tithes in
<hi>France,</hi> from the time of receiving
Christianity; and that this Custom
declined as their Religion did. In
the Council of <hi>Nantz,</hi> about <hi>A. D.
658.</hi> Oblations and Tithes are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:100520:140"/>
together, <hi>c.</hi> 10. as making up
the Churches Stock, which was to
be divided into Four Parts, to the
Bishop, and to the Clergy, and to
Repairs, and to the Poor.</p>
            <p>But besides the Oblations of the
Living, it was then common to
make <hi>Oblations</hi> at their Death; and
these were called <hi>Oblationes defuncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
and severe Canons were made
against the Detainers of them, <hi>Concil.
Vas. I. c. 4. Agath. c. 4, 13. Q. 2, 9,
10,</hi> 11. And so much appears by
those Canons which forbid Exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
at Funerals, <hi>Concil. Tribur. c. 16.
Nannet. c.</hi> 6. where an Exception is
made as to voluntary Gifts, either
by the Parties deceased, or by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutors.
But here, in the <hi>Saxon</hi>
times there was a Funeral Duty to
be paid, called <hi>Pecunia sepulchralis &amp;
Symbolum Animae,</hi> and a <hi>Saxon Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot;</hi>
this is required by the Council
at <hi>Aenham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Spelm. Con. <hi>p.</hi> 517.</note> and inforced by the Laws
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:100520:141"/>
of <hi>Canutus, c.</hi> 14. and was due to the
Church the Party deceased belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to, whether he were there buried
or not. Some take this for the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of <hi>Mortuaries;</hi> but then the
Money must be turned into Goods.
For in <hi>Glanvil</hi>'s time,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Glanvil.</hi> l. 7. c. 5.</note> a Freeholder
is allowed to make his Will of other
things, provided that he give his
first best thing to his Lord, and his
second to the Church. And this was
not originally <hi>pro Animâ defuncti,</hi> as
<hi>Lyndwood</hi> thinks, from the Modern
Canonists <hi>De Consecrat. c.</hi> 12. but it
was a Right of the Church settled on
the Decease of a Member of it, as
appears by the Law of <hi>Canutus.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
have said, That it was in lieu
of Tithes substracted, and Oblations
not duly made. So <hi>Simon Langham</hi>
in his Constitution about <hi>Mortuaries,</hi>
which was made to explain a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Constitution of <hi>Robert Winchelsee,</hi>
because the People were observed
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:100520:141"/>
not to pay their Tithes and Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as they ought. But he did not
go about to settle a Right which had
not been before, but to prevent
Suits about that which was to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for a <hi>Mortuary;</hi> and he declares,
That where there was a choice of
Three or more, the Second was to
be for the Mortuary, <hi>De Sepult. f.
93. b.</hi> So that <hi>R. Winchelsee</hi> supposes
it to be an ancient Right. Indeed in
the <hi>Cotton MS.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Spelm. Concil. <hi>II. p.</hi> 433.</note> of the Council of
<hi>Merton,</hi> where this Constitution is
extant, the Reason is given, That it
was required by way of Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
for the Neglect of Tithes and
Oblations. In the Synod of <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
in his time, a Constitution is
made for the Uniform Payment of
Mortuaries in that Diocess, the second
best of the Goods or Chattels was to
be paid in lieu of Tithes unpaid.<note place="margin">P. 453.</note> In
the Synod of <hi>Exeter</hi> of <hi>Pet. Quivil,
15 E.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">P. 391.</note> the Reason is given for
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:100520:142"/>
the Neglect of all parochial Duties;
but there it is said, That some plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Custom against the Payment of
them, and others, as to the Manner;
and although this Council endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to settle an Uniform Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet the Statute of <hi>Circumspectè
agatis,</hi> leaves the whole Matter to
Custom, <hi>ubi Mortuarium dari consue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Inst. 491.</note>
From whence my Lord <hi>Coke</hi>
inferrs, That <hi>there is no Mortuary due
by Law, but only by Custom.</hi> The
true Inference was, That the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Custom had altered the Law
from what it was in the times of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutus</hi>
and <hi>Glanvil.</hi> But that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
Custom became the standing
Law, as to <hi>Mortuaries,</hi> appears by
the Statute of 21 <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 6. which
limits the Payment where the Custom
continued, but allows Liberty for
<hi>Free Oblations:</hi> And this <hi>Free Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
was then called <hi>Cors presentè,</hi> and
was distinct from the <hi>Mortuary</hi> in
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:100520:142"/>
lieu of Tithes, as appears by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
in Sir <hi>W. Dugdale.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Warwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire, <hi>p.</hi> 470, &amp;c.</note> But I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to other <hi>Oblations,</hi> which <hi>Lynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>
distinguisheth into those <hi>by way
of Gift,</hi> and such as became due. For
these latter, he insists on <hi>c. Omnis
christianus</hi> in the Canon Law, <hi>De Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secr.
D. 1. c.</hi> 69. which requires that
every one who approaches the Altar,
make some <hi>Oblation.</hi> Where the <hi>Gloss</hi>
saith, it is but Counsel at other times,
but a Command on the Festivals.
For this 16 <hi>Q. 1. c.</hi> 55. is produced,
<hi>quas populus dare debet;</hi> but it is there
interpreted of the case of Necessity:
<hi>Hostiensis</hi> thinks all are obliged on
great Festivals, and that the general
Custom lays an Obligation; but
<hi>Lyndwood</hi> thinks the Custom of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Churches is to be observed.</p>
            <p>In the Synod of <hi>Exter</hi> before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Spelm.</hi> II. p. 393.</note> 
               <hi>Oblations</hi> are said to be
of Divine Right, and that every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishioner
is obliged to make them;
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:100520:143"/>
but the Time is limited to <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,
Easter,</hi> the <hi>Saints-day of the
Church and the Dedication,</hi> or <hi>All-Saints.</hi>
So that four times in the Year they
were required to make <hi>Oblations</hi> after
the Age of Fourteen. And so <hi>Giles,</hi>

            <p>In the Synod of <hi>Winchester,</hi> none
were so obliged till Eighteen,<note place="margin">P. 452.</note> and
having Goods of their own.</p>
            <p>But I observe, that in the ancient
Canons here, by the <hi>Oblations,</hi> such
things were then understood, as were
for the Support of the Clergy:
Thence several Canons were made
against those who turned them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way. So in the Council of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
under Archbishop <hi>Stratford,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 410.</note> 
               <hi>Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
are declared to belong only to
<hi>Ecclesiastical Persons.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 585.</note> And so <hi>Lynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>
saith,<note place="margin">

These were called by the Name of the
<hi>Altarage,</hi> and were generally expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
under that Name in the Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Vicarages; but when these
were too small for the Maintenance
of the Vicar, those small Tithes
which were joyned with them, were
comprehended under that Name;
and so it hath been resolved in the
Courts of Law upon a solemn Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.<note place="margin">

               <hi>Iohn de Burgo,</hi> in his <hi>Pupilla Oculi,</hi>
speaking of <hi>Oblations,</hi> saith, That per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
may be bound to them four
Ways:</p>
            <p>1. By Contract upon the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the Church, which amounts
only to a Pension upon Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:100520:144"/>
2. By Promise either living or
dying.</p>
            <p>3. By Necessity, when the paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial
Minister cannot be supported
without it.</p>
            <p>4. By Custom,<note place="margin">Ioh. de Burgo Pupill. Oculi, <hi>f. 118. b.</hi>
               </note> in the greater So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities;
but he saith, the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Kind are left to Discretion;
which made <hi>Oblations</hi> sink so low,
that the parochial Clergy must have
starved, if they had nothing else to
support them.</p>
            <p>But besides these, he mentions <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casional
Oblations</hi> upon particular Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
as at <hi>Marriages, Christenings, Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,</hi>
&amp;c. concerning which we have
several Constitutions against those
who went about to hinder them,<note place="margin">Spelm. <hi>II.</hi> 495, 410.</note> or
to reduce them to a small Quantity.
The <hi>Easter-Offerings</hi> are none of these
Voluntary Oblations,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pupilla Oculi,</hi> Part. 5. c. 21.</note> but a Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for <hi>Personal Tithes</hi> payable at that
time; of which I may have occasion
to speak more afterwards. But in
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:100520:144"/>
the <hi>Saxon</hi> times here were other sorts
of <hi>Oblations;</hi> As (1) the <hi>Cyrycsceat</hi> or
First-fruits of Corn payable at S. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin's
day, Ina LL. 4. 62. Edmund. c.</hi> 2.
and is often mentioned in <hi>Doomsday-book,</hi>
and in <hi>Fleta l. 2. c. 47. Malmsb.
l. 2. c.</hi> 11. and the Oblation of
Poultrey at <hi>Christmas</hi> is mentioned
in <hi>Doomsday,</hi> under that Title.
(2.) There was here another kind
of <hi>Oblation</hi> called <hi>Plow-Alms,</hi> which
was a Peny for every Plow between
<hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whitsontide.</hi> This is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned

            </p>
            <p>But all these Oblations made a

            <p>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:100520:145"/>
III. And therefore I come to the
main Legal Support of the Parochial
Clergy, which is in Tithes. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

            <p>I. To consider the Foundation in
Law which they stand upon.</p>
            <p>II. The Rules of Law which are
to be observed about them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I. As to the</hi> Foundation <hi>they stand
upon in point of Law. My Lord</hi>

confirmed by</hi> William I.<note place="margin">Hob. R. 296.</note> Hobart <hi>saith,
That</hi> Tithes are things of common Right,
and do of Right belong to the Church.
And since Parishes were erected, they
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:100520:145"/>
are due to the Parson (except in spiritual
regular Cases) or Vicar of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.</p>

                  <hi>Regist.</hi> f. 46.</note> 
               <hi>there is a Writ of

they are owned</hi> to be of common Right,
as well as immemorial Custom, due to
the Rector within the Limits of his
Parish.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord Chief Justice</hi> Dyer <hi>saith,</hi>

               <hi>That</hi>
Tithes can never be extinguished, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are of common Right.</p>
            <p>The same is affirmed by Justice
<hi>Dodderidge</hi> in the Case of <hi>Fosse</hi> and
<hi>Parker.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bustrod. 3. 243.</note>

            <p>In <hi>Pieddle</hi> and <hi>Napper</hi>'s Case,<note place="margin">11 R. 13.</note>
Tithes are said to be an Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Inheritance collateral to the
Estate in Land, and of their own
Nature due to an Ecclesiastical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
And, That <hi>all Lands of common
Right are to pay Tithes.</hi> Therefore it
is said by <hi>Hobart</hi> in <hi>Slade</hi>'s Case,<note place="margin">Hob. 298. 44.</note>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:100520:146"/>
That <hi>no Land can be discharged of
Tithes, although it may be discharged
of the actual Payment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Popham</hi>'s Reports we read,<note place="margin">Rolls R. 2. 174.</note>
That <hi>it is a Maxim in Law, that all
Persons ought to pay Tithes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Poph. R. 156.</note> 
               <hi>and all
Lands shall be charged with them of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Right.</hi> So that if the Judgment
of some of the greatest Men of the
Profession may be taken, nothing
can be more clear and evident than
the Legal Right of Tithes. But it
falls out unhappily among us, that
nothing hath been the Occasion of
so much Difference and Contention
between the Incumbents and their
Parishioners, than the Point of the
Payment of Tithes. So that some
have wished them changed into some
other way of Maintenance; but I
cannot see any Reason why so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
so legal, so just a Maintenance
should be changed into any other,
which would less answer the End,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:100520:146"/>
and be liable to as many Difficulties,
if not far more; but every Change
of this kind, where we cannot be
secured of the Event, is very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
especially when it proceeds from
Want of Judgment or Ill-will to the
Profession; both which are to be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
in this case. If the ill Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of some People could be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it would signifie far more to the
Quiet of the Clergy, than altering
their legal Maintenance.</p>
            <p>Therefore the best way is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into the Reasons of this Dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
that we may find out the
proper Methods to remove it, and
thereby to prevent the troublesom
and vexatious Suits about them, which
make the parochial Clergy so uneasie,
and their Labour often unsuccessful
with the People.</p>
            <p>And there is a twofold Dissatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which lies at the bottom of most
of these Contentions about Tithes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:100520:147"/>
1. In Point of Conscience.</p>
            <p>2. In Point of Law.</p>
            <p>1. In Point of Conscience. There
is a sort of People among us, who
are very obstinate in this Matter,
and will rather chuse to go to Prison
and lie there, than pay their Tithes.
I have often thought whence such a
Stiffness should arise in a matter of
Legal Right. If they had opposed
all Determinations of Property by
Law, they had been more consistent
with themselves; but to allow the
Law to determine the Right as to
Nine Parts, and not as to the Tenth,
is not to be reconciled. For if the
Question be concerning the other
parts, to whom they do belong, may
not Men as well dispute the matter
of Dominion and Property in them?
May they not say, that the Seed is
our own, and the Labour and Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:100520:147"/>
our own; why then shall I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to another for the Profit which
arises from my Pains and Expence?
If it be replied, That the Law hath
given the Property of the Land to
one, and the Use to another, why
may they not pretend this to be an
unreasonable Law to separate one
from the other, since Land was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for the Use; and the Original
Right of Dominion was from what
was necessary for Use; therefore the
separating Right and Use, is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment
on the Natural Rights
of Mankind. And there seems to be
more Colour for this, than for any
to allow the Laws to determine the
Right of Nine Parts to belong to
the Lord of the Soil, but the Tenth
by no means to go that way, which
the Law of the Land hath long
since determined it. So that the
Lord of the Soil either by Descent
or Purchase, can claim no Right to
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:100520:148"/>
it; for neither did his Ancestors en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
it, nor those who sold the Land
to a Purchaser consider it as his
own, for then he would have
had the Value of it. The Tenth
Part then is set aside in Valuation of
Estates, as already disposed of; and
the Question is, Whether the same
Law which settled the Right to the
other, shall determine this likewise?
Is it not a part of natural Injustice
to detain that which by Law belongs
to another? And is not the Law
the Measure of Right in Cases of Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between Man and Man;
Why then should not the Law fairly
and equally determine this matter,
to whom the Tenth of the Profits
belongs?</p>
            <p>But still they say, <hi>It is against their
Conscience, and they cannot do it.</hi> Is it
against their Conscience to do Acts
of Natural Justice, not to detain
that from another, which of Right
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:100520:148"/>
belongs to him? But it is in vain to
argue with people, who do not judge
of things by the common light of
Reason and Justice, but by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable
Light within them, which
none can judge of but themselves;
and in matter of Interest Men are
the worst Judges in their own
Case.</p>
            <p>2. Therefore I come to those who
are capable of being argued with;
such, I mean, who are unsatisfied in
the Point of Law, not in general,
but in particular Cases, from whence
Suits arise, and those are often from
these Causes:</p>
            <p>1. Not duly considering the just
Measure and Extent of the Rules of
Law for the Payment of Tithes.</p>
            <p>2. Not attending to the Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions,
or Discharges by Law from
the Payment of Tithes.</p>
            <p>The best way I know to prevent
troublesome Suits about Tithes, is to
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:100520:149"/>
enquire diligently into these two
Things:</p>
            <p>1. The Rules of Law for the
Payment of Tithes. One might have
justly expected, that in a matter of
common Right and daily Practice,
and wherein the Peace and Quiet of
the People is so much concerned, as
well as of the Clergy, the Rules of
Law should have been plain, and
clear, and liable to as few Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as possible; but instead of this,
there is not one general Rule in this
matter, but hath several Exceptions;
and different Opinions have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them by the great Men of the
Law, which hath given too much
occasion to the Multitudes of Suits
which have been in the matter of
Tithes; so that the Clergy are not so
much to blame, if they are unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
involved in Suits by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity
of the Law, and the different
Resolutions which have been made
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:100520:149"/>
about the Cases reported by them.</p>
            <p>This I shall make appear by exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
some of the most general
Rules of Law, and comparing them
with the Resolutions which have been
made in particular Cases.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>One of the most standing Rules
of the Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Law of Tithes, <hi>c. 12. p.</hi> 214.</note> 
               <hi>is, That</hi> Tithes are only
to be paid of things which do annually
increase, ex annuatis renovantibus simul
&amp; semel.</p>
            <p>But is this Rule allowed in all
Cases?</p>
            <p>1. From hence <hi>Coke</hi> concludes, That
<hi>no Tithes are to be paid of Minerals,</hi>

a Petition of the Commons was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
about being sued in the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical

The Petition was renewed, 8 <hi>H.</hi> 4.

on the Register saith,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> That <hi>if Corn
do grow there, Tithe of it would be due
however.</hi> So that here we have a
Rule against an ancient Custom and
Rule too. But it cannot be denied,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:100520:150"/>
that <hi>Fitz-Herbert</hi> and <hi>Brook</hi> say,<note place="margin">F. N. B. 53. B. 241.</note> That
<hi>there is no Tithe of Quarries, or Coals, or

11 <hi>Iac.</hi> and 14 <hi>Iac.</hi> and in other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

yields,<note place="margin">March 58<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> That <hi>a Custom in these cases

be no Custom to the contrary.
And as to Minerals, it is determined
by a late Writer,<note place="margin">Law of Tithes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 214.</note> That <hi>by Custom
Tithes may be due of them, although
they do not annually increase.</hi> And
my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> mentions King <hi>Iohn</hi>'s
Grant to the Bishop of <hi>Exeter of the

               <hi>the Tithe of Lead is the

Therefore my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> concludes

Rule, That <hi>by Custom a Parson
may have Tithes of such things as are
not titheable of common Right.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Inst. 664.</note>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:100520:151"/>
2. From hence it is concluded,
That <hi>no Tithe can be due for Houses,
because they have no annual Increase.</hi>
This was solemnly debated in Dr.
<hi>Grant</hi>'s Case,<note place="margin">11 R. 15, 16. Rolls 1. 636.</note> 11 <hi>Iac.</hi> and that there
was no Tithe due, was proved by
the Counsel from the <hi>Register, Fitz. H.
N. B. Brook,</hi> &amp;c. But it was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the Court, That although
Houses of themselves were not tithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
yet there might be a <hi>Modus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimandi</hi>
on the Ground on which the
Houses stood, and the Houses did
not take away the Right before;
and in most ancient Cities and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs
there was such a <hi>Modus</hi> for the
Maintenance of their Minister. I
grant that there was a certain <hi>Modus
decimandi</hi> upon Houses, but not upon
the Account of the Ground they
stood upon; but there was a custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
Duty upon Houses in lieu of
Tithes, and were accounted a sort
of <hi>Praedial Tithes,</hi> although they were
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:100520:151"/>
called <hi>Oblationes de Domibus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lyndw. de Decimis. c. Sanct c. Negotiat.</note> as <hi>Lynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>
saith, and were distinct from
Personal Tithes, for the <hi>Iews</hi> were
bound to pay Tithes of Houses,
but not personal. Such was the
Rate on Houses in <hi>London:</hi> But in
Dr. <hi>Layfield</hi>'s Case it was denied,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Selden</hi> of Tithes, 244.</note>
that there could be a Prescription of
Tithes upon Houses, because they are
to be paid only for the Increase of
things.<note place="margin">Cr. Car. 596.</note> What is now become of the
former <hi>Modus decimandi,</hi> when a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
was here insisted upon and
denied?<note place="margin">Hob. 1. 11.</note> So that here were different
Opinions, a special Custom was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
upon good Reason; and here
a Prescription disallowed upon such
a Reason as would have overthrown
the former Custom, and yet the Law
was the same still.</p>
            <p>3. From hence it would follow,
That if this Rule hold, things which
have not an annual Increase would
not be titheable: Then no Tithe of
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:100520:152"/>
Saffron would be due, whose Heads
are gathered but once in three years,
nor of <hi>Sylva caedua,</hi> under twenty
years; and yet this was allowed in
Parliament at <hi>Sarum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Regist. 49.</note> saith the <hi>Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
notwithstanding it was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
every year.<note place="margin">Rolls 1. 640.</note> And <hi>Rolls</hi> saith,
That <hi>Tithes</hi> shall be paid of Beeches,
Hazle, Willows, Holly, Alder, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
even after twenty Years, because
they are not Timber. But what
if Willows be used for Timber?
Then <hi>Hobart</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Hob. 219.</note> they ought to
be excepted. If young Trees grow
in a Nursery,<note place="margin">Cr. Car. 526.</note> and be sold,<note place="margin">Rolls 1. 637.</note> it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
that Tithes shall be paid of
them,<note place="margin">Iones 416.</note> and these are not renewed
every year.<note place="margin">Hardres 381.</note> And what becomes
now of this <hi>General Rule,</hi> when so
many Exceptions are made to it?</p>
            <p>4. <hi>If this Rule hold, there can
be no Tithes of</hi> After-pasture, <hi>for the
Rule is</hi> simul &amp; semel. <hi>And my
Lord</hi> Coke <hi>saith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Inst. 652.</note> 
               <hi>It was adjudged,</hi>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:100520:152"/>
8 Iac. <hi>That</hi> a Parson shall not have
two Tithes of Land in one year; <hi>and he
instances</hi> in the Hay and After-pasture,
<hi>&amp;c.And yet</hi> Rolls <hi>affirms,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rolls 1. 640.</note> 
               <hi>That</hi>
it is due by Law, unless there be a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
to the contrary; <hi>and he saith,</hi>
the Iudgment was given upon the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription.
<hi>And therefore he resolves it
into a</hi> Modus decimandi.<note place="margin">648.</note> 
               <hi>But he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
several Judgments,</hi> that no Tithe
is due for After-pasture, where Tithe-Hay
hath been paid before; <hi>which
must be where there was no Custom
to the contrary, or else he must
contradict himself.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Yelv. 86.</note> 
               <hi>And so</hi> Yelverton
<hi>saith in the Case of</hi> Green <hi>and</hi> Austen,
<hi>That</hi> of common Right, Tithe-Hay dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges
the Tithe of the After-pasture.
<hi>But</hi> Crook <hi>saith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cr. Iac. 116.</note> 
               <hi>That</hi> in that case
the Court went upon the Prescription,
and allowed it to be good. <hi>How could
it go upon both? And Sir</hi> S. Degge
<hi>is positive,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Law of Tithes, 190. c. 3.</note> 
               <hi>that</hi> if a Meadow affords
two Crops, the Parson shall have Tithe
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:100520:153"/>
of both. <hi>How can these things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist?
Or what Authority may we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon in such Difference of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Another Rule in Law is, That
<hi>things which are</hi> ferae Naturae,<note place="margin">2 Inst. 651. Law of Tithes c. 8.</note> 
               <hi>are not
tithable.</hi> But here we are to seek
what things are <hi>ferae Naturae?</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
such things as may be tamed and
kept under Custody, and become a
Man's Property, are <hi>ferae Naturae?</hi>
Is it not Felony to steal <hi>Rabbets</hi> or
<hi>Pigeons?</hi> if it be, they must be some
Man's Property; and if they be a
Man's proper Goods, how can they
be said to be <hi>ferae Naturae?</hi> For the
meaning was, That no Man was to
pay <hi>Tithes</hi> for that which was not
his own. Are not <hi>Bees ferae Naturae,</hi>
as much as <hi>Pigeons</hi> and <hi>Rabbets?</hi>
But the <hi>Tithe</hi> of <hi>Bees</hi> is allowed to
be paid by the Tenth of the Honey
and Wax.<note place="margin">Cr. Car. 559.</note> But <hi>Rolls</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Iones, 447. F. N. B. 51. Rolls. 1. 651.</note> 
               <hi>That it
was doubted whether a Tenth Swarm
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:100520:153"/>
were a good</hi> Modus <hi>for the Tithe of
Bees, because they are</hi> ferae Naturae.
The Reason is, because they are left
wild, and under no Custody; but
if they went into several Hives be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Proprietor, they might
be tithable by the Hives. And so for
Pigeons under Custody in a Dove-house,
they are a Man's Property,
and therefore tithable: As it hath
been several times resolved in Courts
of Law, 14 <hi>Iac.</hi> in <hi>Whately</hi> and <hi>Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor</hi>'s
Case,<note place="margin">Rolls, 1. 635.</note> in <hi>Iones</hi> and <hi>Gastrill</hi>'s Case,
a Prohibition was denied; and Justice
<hi>Dodderidge</hi> declared, to whom the
Court assented, that Tithe was due
both of young Pigeons and Conies.<note place="margin">Rolls, R. 2. 2.</note>
But the prevailing Opinion hath been,
<hi>That if they are consumed in the House,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hetley, 147.</note>
               <hi>they are not tithable,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Littleton, 3. n. 40.</note> 
               <hi>but if sold, they
are.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rolls, 1. 644.</note> But are they not <hi>ferae Naturae</hi>
as well when they are sold at Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
as when they are eaten at home?
Why then are they tithable in one
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:100520:154"/>
Case, and not in the other? If they
are tithable at all, they are so where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they are spent; for in tithing,
the Nature of the thing is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
and not the Place of spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it. For upon the same Reason
there would be no Tithe of Corn
spent at home, or Pigs, Calves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and therefore I look on the Reason
as of worse Consequence, than the
total denying the Payment. For who
can tell how far this Reason may be
carried in other Cases?</p>
            <p>But it is resolved in many Cases,<note place="margin">March, 56.</note>
that though they are <hi>ferae Naturae,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hetley, 13.</note>
yet by Custom they may be tithed;<note place="margin">Rolls, 1. 635, 636.</note>
and so for Fish. Custom it seems hath
the Power of reducing things <hi>ferae
Naturae</hi> to the same Condition with
other things.<note place="margin">Palmer, 527.</note> But as far as I can find,
these things by our old Constitutions,<note place="margin">Cr. Car. 264, 339.</note>
were as tithable as other things;
but the notion of their being <hi>ferae Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae</hi>
being started,<note place="margin">Lyndw. 101. Spel. II. 503.</note> served as a Plea
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:100520:154"/>
against them, where the Custom was
not continued; and where it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all Dispute,<note place="margin">Hardr. 188.</note> then they said,
they were not tithable in themselves,<note place="margin">Kebl. 2. 452.</note>
but only by Custom;<note place="margin">1 Inst. 115. 6. 244.</note> or not by Law,
but by Custom; and yet such Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
make a part of our Law.</p>
            <p>In several ancient Appropriations,<note place="margin">Monast. I. 577. 646. 1002.</note>
Fish, and Pigeons, and Rabbets are
expresly mentioned, as given toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with other Tithes; so that in
those times both Law and Custom
went together.<note place="margin">II. 4. 658.</note> For the Lords of
Manors were not wont to give
Tithes which were not otherwise
due.</p>
            <p>3. But what is to be done with
those Lands which might afford
Tithe, if the Increase of Grass were
suffered but the Owners feed Cattel
upon it, and so there can be no
Tithes, what Remedy doth the Law
afford in this case?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:100520:155"/>
1. It is agreed that no Tithe is
due,<note place="margin">Lynd. f. 99.</note> if no other Cattel be fed,<note place="margin">F. N. B. 53.</note> but
such as the Owner pays Tithe for,<note place="margin">2 Inst. 651.</note>
or are imployed in plowing, or any
other way which is for the Benefit
of the Incumbent of that Parish where
they are fed. For otherwise they are
but as barren Cattel to him.</p>
            <p>2. That there is a certain Rate
due for the Agistment of barren
Cattel,<note place="margin">Hardres, 184.</note> 
               <hi>Iure communi,</hi> and so deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Hales</hi> then Chief Baron, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Value of the Land,
unless Custom hath determined other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
And so for Guest-Horses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
unless the Inn-keeper had paid Tithe-Hay,<note place="margin">Poph. 142.</note>
say some, or the Custom be
otherwise:<note place="margin">Rolls, 1. 641, 650.</note> But none for <hi>Saddle-Horses</hi>
for the Use of the Owner.<note place="margin">Bulst. 1. 171.</note> One of the
Judges dissenting,<note place="margin">Rolls, 1. 641.</note> because not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for Husbandry.<note place="margin">Poph. 126, 197.</note> But for unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
Cattel the tenth part of the
Bargain is due, or according to the
Value of the Land, and the Owner
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:100520:155"/>
of the Cattel is compellable to pay.<note place="margin">Hardr. 184.</note>
            </p>
            <p>3. If profitable and unprofitable
be mixed, so as the latter be the
greater Number, then Herbage must
be paid for them, and Tithe in kind
for the profitable;<note place="margin">Law of Tithes 200.</note> but if the profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
be the greater Number, it is
questioned whether the other are not
excused; but no Law or Precedent
is produced for it: And there seems
to be no Reason, if Pasturage be due
for unprofitable Cattel, why they
should be excused because there are
more profitable, unless their Number
be inconsiderable.</p>
            <p>These things I have only briefly
touched at, that you may the better
govern your selves in Disputes of this
Nature; and as you are not to lose
the just Rights of the Church, so
neither is it for your Interest or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to be engaged in them, where
the Law will not bear you out.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:100520:156"/>
II. The next thing necessary to be
considered, is, the legal Discharges
from the Payment of <hi>Tithes.</hi> For,
although the Reason of the Payment
of them be founded on the Law of
God, and the Settlement of Tithes
among us hath been by ancient and
unquestionable Laws of the Land,
yet the Recovery of Tithes when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
detained, can be no otherwise
than by the Law of the Land, as it
is now in force. And if these do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
several Discharges and Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
not to be found in the ancient
Laws or Practice, we shall but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
our selves in fruitless-Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
if we dispute those Limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which the Law hath put upon
the Payment of Tithes. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Business is to enquire and
satisfie our selves, as well as we can,
about the Nature and Extent of these
Limitations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:100520:156"/>
Now there are four sorts of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges
of the Payment of Tithes
allowed.</p>
            <p>1. By Appropriations to Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries.</p>
            <p>2. By Privileges of particular Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
            <p>3. By Prescription and real Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions.</p>
            <p>4. By Unity and Possession.</p>
            <p>Of these I shall discourse in order,
so as to clear the greatest Difficulties,
with respect to them.</p>
            <p>1. As to <hi>Appropriations.</hi> By the
Statute of Dissolution, 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 13.
the new Possessors are to enjoy their
Parsonages appropriated, Tithes, Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and Portions, and all other
Lands belonging to them, discharged
and acquitted of the Payment of
Tithes, as freely, and in as ample a
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:100520:157"/>
manner as they were enjoyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 7. It is Enacted, That
no persons shall be compelled, or
otherwise sued to yield, give or pay
any manner of Tithes for any Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
Lands, Tenements, or other
Hereditaments, which by Laws or
Statutes of this Realm are discharged,
or not chargeable with the payment
of any such Tithes. So that we must
enquire into the State of Parsona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
appropriated before the Dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and how the payment of Tithes
stood then.</p>
            <p>I will not deny that there were
Churches appropriated to Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in the <hi>Saxon</hi> times; but if Mr.
<hi>Selden</hi>'s Doctrine hold good, as to the
<hi>Arbitrary Consecration of Tithes till the
Twelfth Century,</hi> those Churches can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
carry the Tithes along with them,
but only such Glebe and Oblations
as belonged to them. For how could
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:100520:157"/>
the Tithes pass with the Churches, if
they were not then annexed to them?
But he confesses,<note place="margin">Hist. of Tithes, 370.</note> 
               <hi>That the mention of
Tithes with Churches in Appropriations,
was rare, or not at all till after the</hi>
Normans. The Reason might be,
that the Separation of Tithes from the
Churches, was not known till
the <hi>Norman</hi> times. For the <hi>Norman</hi>
Nobility took little notice of the
<hi>Saxon</hi> Laws about Tithes; but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Tithes paid out of the Lands
within their Manors, they thought
they did well, if they gave the whole
Tithes, or a Portion and Share of
them, as they thought fit, to some
Monastery either abroad or at home.
And this I take to be the true Account
of the beginning of Appropriations
among us. It were endless to give
an Account of the Appropriations
made by the <hi>Normans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

gave several Churches with their
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:100520:158"/>
Tithes to <hi>Battle-Abbey. William Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus</hi>
added more. <hi>H.</hi> 1. to the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of <hi>Reading,</hi> several Churches in
like-manner;<note place="margin">417.</note> and <hi>H.</hi> 2. more. <hi>Hugh</hi>
Earl of <hi>Chester,</hi> gave the Tithes of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Manors to the Monastery of
St.<note place="margin">202.</note> 
               <hi>Werburg,</hi> in the time of <hi>William</hi> I.
Of which kind the Instances are too
many to be mentioned; instead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
I shall set down the State of the
parochial Clergy under these Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations,
which was very mean,
and intended so to be, being supplied
by the <hi>English</hi> Clergy.</p>
            <p>1. Where the Churches and Tithes
were appropriated to a Monastery,
the Vicar had only such a Competen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
as the Bishop thought fit to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
till Vicarages came to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed:
For right understanding this
matter of Appropriations, as it stood
here in <hi>England,</hi> these things are to
be considered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:100520:158"/>
1. That there was a parochial
Right of Tithes settled in the <hi>Saxon</hi>
times: Which I infer from the Laws
of <hi>Edgar</hi> and <hi>Canutus,</hi> where the
Tithes are required to be paid to
the Mother-Church;<note place="margin">L. L. Saxon.</note> and if the Lord
of a Manor have a Church on his

But as to the parochial Right of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:100520:159"/>
Tithes among us, it stands thus: By
the <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws the parochial was
settled. After the <hi>Norman</hi> Invasion
these Laws were neglected and
slighted by the <hi>Normans; H.</hi> I. by
his Charter restored them, <hi>H. 1. c.</hi> 11.
and the very Words of the Laws of
<hi>Edgar</hi> and <hi>Canutus</hi> are repeated. The
<hi>Normans</hi> went on notwithstanding,
and so these Laws were discontinued
in Practice. But <hi>Hadrian</hi> 4. who was
an <hi>Englishman</hi> by Birth, observing the
disorderly Payments of Tithes here,
published a Constitution to require
the parochial Payment of them, as
is observed by <hi>P. Pithaeus,</hi> a very
learned and impartial Man. After
him <hi>Alexander</hi> 3. in a Decretal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to the Archbishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
and his Suffragans,<note place="margin">Not. in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. l. 3. c. 30. n. 4.</note> complains,
<hi>That whereas the Parishioners had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
paid their Tithes entirely where
they ought to pay them, the contrary
Custom had obtained; and some withdrew
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:100520:160"/>
the Tithe of Wooll, Fish, and Mills;
therefore he requires the strict Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them to the Churches to which
they were due.</hi> The latter part only
is in the Canon Law, but the former
is added from the Ancient Copies by
<hi>Pithaeus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Decretal</hi> of <hi>Innocent</hi> III.
to which my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> refers, and
Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> thinks was mistaken for
the <hi>Lateran Council, being brought into</hi>
England <hi>with it;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Innocent. 3.</note> there is such an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
extant in the Collection of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles,<note place="margin">Epist. 2. c. 114.</note>
but not put into the Canon
Law, and was nothing but an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement
of the former Laws, and
a declaring the contrary Custom
void, which had too much obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
since the <hi>Norman</hi> times. But in a
Decretal extant in the Canon Law,
<hi>De Decim. c.</hi> 29. he acknowledges the
parochial payment of Tithes to be
due by common Right, <hi>Cum perceptio
Decimarum ad Paroeciales Ecclesias de
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:100520:160"/>
Iure communi pertineat.</hi> Can any thing
be plainer than that the parochial
Right could not depend upon his
Decretal Epistle, when himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
that they were due by common
Right?</p>
            <p>We do not deny that he inforced
the payment which had been so
grosly neglected in the <hi>Norman</hi> times,
and the most they would be brought
to in many places, was to pay only
a third part to the Parish-Priest who
officiated, and gave the rest to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries,
and often appropriated the
whole Tithes to them, either at home
or abroad, as will abundantly appear
by the <hi>Monasticon;</hi> from whence it
is plain, that they looked on Tithes
in general, as due to the Church, as
appears by very many of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Charters;<note place="margin">Monast. I. 112, 114, 201, 202, 327, 590, 436.</note> but they thought they
did very well when they appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
them to Monasteries of their
own Erection,<note place="margin">II. 50, 81.</note> or others, as they
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:100520:161"/>
thought fit. But this Humour took
so much among the <hi>Norman</hi> Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and served so many Purposes of
Honour and Devotion, as they
thought (besides Reason of State)
that the parochial Clergy were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to so poor a Condition, that
<hi>Alexander IV.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Du Fresn. e. <hi>Appropr.</hi>
               </note> complained of it as
<hi>the Bane of Religion, and Destruction of
the Church, and as a Poison which had
spread over the whole Nation.</hi> And it
must be very scandalous indeed,
when the Pope complained of it:
For the Monks that were able, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
got their <hi>Appropriations</hi> confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. There was a Competency to
be settled on the parochial Clergy
by the Bishops Consent, which was
required in order to the confirming
an Appropriation;<note place="margin">Monast. I. 369, 399.</note> as may be seen in
Multitudes of them in the <hi>Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">II. 58, 208, 656, 881.</note>
besides those which are preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the Churches Registers.<note place="margin">III. 32, 36.</note> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:100520:161"/>
the Endowment is expressed,
and at other times it is reserved in the
Bishop's power to do it as he sees
Cause. But the Bishops were either
so remiss in those Times, or the
Monks so powerful at <hi>Rome,</hi> that
the poor Vicars fared so hardly, that
in the time of <hi>H. 2. Alexander III.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Extr. de Praeb. c. <hi>De Monachis.</hi>
               </note>
sent a Reprimand to the Bishops for
favouring the Monks too much, and
the Clergy too little; and therefore
requires the Bishops to take care that
the Vicar had a competent Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence,
so as to be able to bear the
Burden of his Place, and to keep Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitality.
This was directed to the
Bishop of <hi>Worcester;</hi> for it seems so
long since the poor Vicars here were
hardly provided for. And yet I have
seen several Forms of Appropriations
made by the Bishops here, after the
Conquest, wherein there is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
<hi>Salvo;</hi> one for the Bishop's Right,
and another for a sufficient Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:100520:162"/>
for the Curate, although the
Church were appropriated <hi>ad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munem
usum Monachorum,</hi> as of <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan,
Roger,</hi> and of <hi>William</hi> in the
time of <hi>Hen. II.</hi> when <hi>Alexander III.</hi>
lived, and of <hi>Walter de Grey, Sylvester,</hi>
&amp;c. But it seems where a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Subsistence had been decreed,<note place="margin">Ext. de Praeb. c. <hi>Avar.</hi>
               </note> the
Monks took the first Opportunity to
lessen it; which occasioned another
<hi>Decretal</hi> in the Canon Law, wherein
any such thing is forbidden, without
the Bishop's Consent.<note place="margin">Ext. de Praeb. c. <hi>Extirp.</hi>
               </note> In other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
they pleaded Custom for it; thence
came another Decree of the <hi>Lateran</hi>
Council, to void all such Customs
by whomsoever introduced, where
there was not a competent Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
for him that served the Cure.</p>
            <p>The Monks were still refractary
in this matter;<note place="margin">Extr. de Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nachis, ubi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra.</note> and because the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
had Power to refuse any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
presented by the Monks, unless
they did consent to such a reasonable
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:100520:162"/>
Allowance as the Bishop thought fit;
therefore they grew sullen, and would
not present;<note place="margin">Ext. de Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plend. Neglig. Prael. Sicut nobis.</note> in which Case another
Decretal was made to give the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
Power to present.</p>
            <p>And after all, <hi>Clement</hi> V. <hi>De Iure
Patron. c.</hi> 1. reinforced the former
Decretals, and injoyned the Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sans
in the strictest manner, not to
admit any person presented to a Cure,
where the Church was appropriated,
unless sufficient Allowance were made
by the Bishop's Consent and Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
and all Custom and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
to the contrary are declared to
be void.</p>
            <p>But how far doth this hold among
us now, since the Appropriations are
become Lay-Fees, and the Bishop's
Power is not mentioned in the Statute
of Dissolution? To this I shall give
a clear Answer, but I doubt not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory,
to all Parties concerned. For
as Necessity and Power, so some
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:100520:163"/>
Mens Interest and Reason live very
near one another.</p>
            <p>1. The Statute of Dissolution
leaves all matters of Right as to
persons interested just as they were
before. For by the Surrender the King
was to have the Monasteries and
Tithes in as large and ample a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as the Abbots then had them in
Right of their Houses, and in the
same State and Condition as they
then were, or of Right ought to have
been: And so <hi>res transit cum suo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere.</hi>
But this is not all: For there is
an Express <hi>Salvo</hi> for all Rights,
Claims, Interests, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of all Persons
and Bodies Politick. So that if by
the Law of <hi>England</hi> there was such an
Antecedent Right in the Vicar to his
Allowance, and in the Bishop to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
it, it is not taken away by this
Statute, nor any other.</p>
            <p>2. By the Law of <hi>England</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
had a Right to provide a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:100520:163"/>
Maintenance for supplying the
Cure upon an Appropriation. We
are told by an unquestionable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in point of Law, that 9 <hi>Car.
1.</hi> this Point was brought before the
<hi>Kings Bench,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rolls, 2. 337.</note> in the Case of <hi>Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
and <hi>Hitchcot.</hi> The Vicar com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
that the Church was appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated,
and that he wanted a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Maintenance; a Prohibition
was prayed, but denied upon this
Reason, That the Vicar had Reason
for his Suit, and that the Ordinary
might compel the Impropriator to
make it greater; because in all Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations
that Power was reserved
to the Ordinary. And so in the
<hi>Year-Books</hi> it is allowed, <hi>That the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
may increase or diminish the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car's
Portion, 40 E. 3. Cas. 15. f.
28.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. Const. de Offic. Vic. c. <hi>quoniam.</hi>
               </note> By our Provincial Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the Bishop is to take care that
the Vicar have a competent Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
which at that time was set
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:100520:164"/>
at Five Marks; but <hi>Lyndwood</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,
that as the Price of things rose,
so the Allowance was increased, and
in Stipendiaries it was then advanced
to Eight or Ten Marks; which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Sir <hi>H. Spelman</hi>'s Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,<note place="margin">Of Tithes, <hi>p.</hi> 153.</note>
comes to above Sixty Pounds
<hi>per Annum.</hi> But some have told us,
<hi>That by some old Statutes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Miscel Parl. 183.</note> 
               <hi>even bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
Persons were not by Law to have
above Six Marks</hi> per Annum; for this
was the Sum allowed to <hi>Parish Priests;</hi>
which is so gross a Mistake in any
that pretend to Law or Antiquity,
that it is to be wondred how they
could fall into it.</p>
            <p>The Truth of the Case was this;
the parochial Chaplains or Priests were
complained of, 36 <hi>E. 3. n.</hi> 23. that
they could not be gotten to attend
after the Plague,<note place="margin">Birchington, l. 42.</note> but at excessive
Rates; upon this a Provincial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
was made, extant in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
Rolls, wherein they are
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:100520:164"/>
obliged to demand no more than
Six Marks.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lyndw.</hi> f. 32. Sacerdos Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochialis <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to</hi> Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiatus.</note> But who were these
Parish-Priests? Not such as had the
legal Endowments, but those who
depended on the Good-Will of the
Parson or People, and were hired
to officiate in Chapels of Ease, or
to perform Offices for the Dead,
which were so frequent at that time.
And these were called <hi>Annual Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains,</hi>
or <hi>Masse Chaplains,</hi> and were
distinguished from <hi>Domestick Chaplains</hi>
who officiated in great Mens Houses
in their private Oratories,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lyndw.</hi> f. 1</note> and from
<hi>Beneficed Persons,</hi> as appears by many
Constitutions. But whatever was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
by the Act of Parliament
then, it was repealed 21 <hi>Iac. 1.
28.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The Law of <hi>England,</hi> as to a
competent Subsistence for the Vicars
or Curates in appropriated Churches,
is founded on very good Reason. For
the <hi>Tithes</hi> were originally given for
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:100520:165"/>
the Service of the Church, and not
for the Use of Monasteries. And
this was a hard Point for the Monks
to get over, since the <hi>Tithes</hi> were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for the Maintenance of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
and they were none of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
how they came to have a Right
to the <hi>Tithes.</hi> It is certain, that the
State of the Clergy and the Monastick
State were different; and the Offices
of the Clergy and of the Monks were
inconsistent, if they held to their
Rules; how then came the Monks
to take the Maintenance which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to the Clergy for other Offices,
as though they were originally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for them? For which there is
no Colour or Pretence. This Point
was debated between two Great Men
of their times, S. <hi>Bernard</hi> and <hi>Petrus
Cluniacensis:</hi> The former a <hi>Cistertian
Monk,</hi> declared himself unsatisfied
with the Monks taking the Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the parochial Clergy from
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:100520:165"/>
them, which was given on purpose
to attend the Cure of Souls. <hi>But,</hi>
said <hi>Petrus Cluniacensis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Petr. Cluniac. Ep. l. 1. 21.</note> 
               <hi>do we not pray
for their Souls?</hi> But the Cure of Souls
is another thing; and by the Canons
of the Church the Monks were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
to meddle in parochial Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>Preaching,</hi>
               <note place="margin">D. 55. c. 1. C. 16. Q. 1. c. 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>Baptizing, Visiting
the Sick.</hi> So that it might bear a
Question in Law, Whether a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
were capable of an Appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
since by the Ecclesiastical Law,
they are not an Ecclesiastical Body?
and for that Reason <hi>Hobart</hi> saith, <hi>a
Nunnery is not;</hi> and the same Reason
will hold for the other.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cistertian Order</hi> was at first
very scrupulous in this matter, when
they came hither,<note place="margin">Mon. I. 699.</note> and pretended <hi>to
live only on their own Lands, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked
Appropriations,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rolls, R. 2. 480.</note> 
               <hi>as great Injuries
to the Clergy,</hi> and called it <hi>Sacrilege</hi>
to take their <hi>Tithes</hi> away from them.
This was wisely done of them at first
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:100520:166"/>
to ingratiate themselves with the
Clergy, and to get as good Lands
as they could. But after a while
they abated their Zeal, and then
they pretended to do nothing without
the Bishops Consent;<note place="margin">Mon. I. 736.</note> till at last they
were as ready as any, and got as
large Privileges to exempt their
Lands from Payment of <hi>Tithes,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which the Clergy suffer to this
day.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Beginning of
Appropriations among us.</p>
            <p>After the <hi>Normans</hi> coming, they
stood upon no Niceties of Law, or
Original Grants, but they took Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions
of the <hi>Tithes</hi> of their Manors,
and disposed them as they pleased.
The poor parochial Clergy were
<hi>English,</hi> whom they hated, and cared
not how poor they were; the Bishops
were <hi>Normans,</hi> as fast as they could
make them; and the business of the
Great Men, was to incourage the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:100520:166"/>
               <hi>Norman</hi> Monks that came over, and
to build and endow Monasteries for
them <hi>to pray for their Souls,</hi> which
they minded so little themselves; and
this I take to be the true Account of
the Beginning and Increase of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations
in <hi>England,</hi> which at first
were only permitted, but are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by the Law since the Statute
of Dissolution.</p>
            <p>II. In some Appropriations there
were Vicarages endowed, and here
the Difficulty lies in distinguishing
the <hi>Tithes</hi> which belong to one from
the other. Before the Statutes for
Endowment of Vicarages, in case of
Appropriations, 15 <hi>R. 2. 6. 4 H. 4.
12.</hi> there were Endowments made,
where the Bishops took care of it;
but they were generally so remiss in
it, that those Statutes were thought
very necessary; and one, it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> seems,
was not sufficient. For they eluded
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:100520:167"/>
the former by appointing Vicars out of
their own Body; but the latter Statute
requires, That the Vicar shall be a
Secular Person, and made Spiritual
Vicar, and have such an Endowment
as the Ordinary should think fit,
otherwise the Appropriation to be
void.</p>
            <p>The Scandal of the Appropriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
was made so great by the Gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
of the Monks, and Easiness of
the Bishops, that I find in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Rolls 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 51. a Petition
of the Commons, that no Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations
should be made for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
but afterwards they came to
that Temper which is expressed in
the Statute 4 <hi>H.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>And that before those Statutes,
there was no Necessity of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment
of a Vicarage, is plain
from the Occasion of making them;
and so it hath been agreed in the
Courts of Law in the Case of <hi>Britton</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rolls, R. 2. 99. Cr. 2. 518.</note>
               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:100520:167"/>
and <hi>Ward.</hi> But the main Difficulty is,
to state the Tithes which belonged
to the Vicarage and to the Appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation;
because there was no certain
Limitation either as to Quantity or
Kind, although generally the great
Tithes of Corn and Hay went with
the Parsonage, and the small Tithes
and Obventions, and Altarage with
the Vicarage.</p>
            <p>The best Rules I can find to be
satisfied in this matter,<note place="margin">Yelv. 86.</note> are the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment,
or Prescription. And
where the Endowment is found, yet
there may be a Prescription for Tithes
not mentioned; because the Bishop
had a Power reserved to increase the
Allowance: As in the Case of the
Vicar of <hi>Gillingham,</hi> who sued for
customary Tithes not mentioned in
the Endowment; and he recovered
them on this Presumption,<note place="margin">Hardr. 328.</note> That the
Vicarage might be augmented with
those Tithes; and in case of long
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:100520:168"/>
Possession, it is there said to have
been often so held and ruled. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
there is a Difficulty in the Sense
of the Words of the Endowment,
as in the Case of <hi>Barksdale</hi> and <hi>Smith,</hi>
whether <hi>Decima Garbarum in W.</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
Tithe-Hay;<note place="margin">Cr. El. 633.</note> but it was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that although <hi>Garba</hi> seems to
relate to Corn, <hi>de omni Annonâ deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
Garba Deo reddenda est. L. Edw.
Confess. c.</hi> 8. at least, to something
bound up; and so <hi>Lyndwood</hi> applies
it to Faggots; yet the Custom was
thought sufficient to extend it to
Tithe-Hay; and for Tithe-Wood in
<hi>Renoulds</hi> and <hi>Green</hi>'s Case.<note place="margin">Bulstr. 2. 27.</note> But the
greatest Difficulty hath been about
<hi>small Tithes,</hi> which is the common
Endowment of Vicarages. In the
Case of <hi>Ward</hi> and <hi>Britton,</hi> one Point
was,<note place="margin">Palmer, 219. Cr. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ac. 516.</note> Whether Lambs were <hi>small
Tithes</hi> or not. <hi>Noy</hi> pleaded Custom
for it. The Councel on the other
side said, That <hi>small Tithes</hi> were such
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:100520:168"/>
as grew in Gardens; but Lambs
were a sort of <hi>Praedial Tithes;</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
it was yielded, that Custom
might bring them under <hi>small Tithes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Point about <hi>small Tithes,</hi>
was about <hi>Saffron</hi> growing in a
Corn-Field,<note place="margin">Cr. Eliz. 467.</note> in the Case of <hi>Bedingfield</hi>
and <hi>Freak,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Moor, 909.</note> and it was resolved to be
<hi>small Tithes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hutton, 78.</note> But the Ground of
that Resolution was questioned in
the Case of <hi>Udal</hi> and <hi>Tyndal;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Owen, 74,</note> some
said it was, because <hi>Saffron</hi> was <hi>small
Tithes</hi> where-ever it grew: Others,
That by the Endowment,<note place="margin">Cr. Car. 28.</note> the Parson
had only reserved the Tithe of Corn
and Hay.</p>
            <p>But suppose whole Fields be plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with <hi>Woad,</hi> which grows in the
Nature of an Herb, is this to be
reckoned among <hi>small Tithes? Crook</hi>
seems to deliver the Sense of the
Court so, in the former Case; but
<hi>Hutton</hi> reports it, that it might come
to be <hi>majores Decimae</hi> and <hi>Praedial,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hutton<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 78.</note> if
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:100520:169"/>
it came to be the main Profits of the
Place. And the like may hold as to
Hemp, Hops, Wooll and Lambs.
It's there said, that all these new
things, as Saffron, Hemp, Woad,
Tobacco, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are to be reckoned
among <hi>small Tithes,</hi> unless there be
some material Circumstance to the
contrary. But who is to be Judge
of that? And what Proportion chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<hi>small Tithes</hi> into <hi>greater?</hi> But
what if the Endowment be so expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that only Tithes of Corn and
Hay be reserved to the Parson?
Then <hi>Rolls</hi> thinks all the rest falls to
the Vicar by Construction of Law.<note place="margin">Rolls, A. 2. 331.</note>
            </p>
            <p>By the Word <hi>Altarage,</hi> it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved

            <p>II. The next Discharge of Tithes,
is by the Privileges of particular
Orders allowed by our Law. For it
is, to be observed, that no Bulls
of Popes make a legal Discharge;
but in such Cases where the Law
allows them, and my Lord <hi>Coke</hi>
thinks it cannot be insisted upon
without danger of a <hi>Praemunire.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Inst. 653.</note> For
when the <hi>Cistertians</hi> had procured
new Bulls to inlarge their Privileges,
as to their Lands in the Hands of Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
a Law was passed against it,
2 <hi>H. 4. c.</hi> 4. which was grounded on
a Petition in Parliament shewing the
Novelty and Mischief of it.<note place="margin">Rot. Parl. 2 H. 4. 41.</note>
               <note place="margin">Mon. II. 511.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It was affirmed by our great Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,<note place="margin">Cr. 2. 578.</note>
that the Pope's Act in dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:100520:170"/>
the Body of the Templars,
which was done, 5 <hi>E.</hi> 2. had no
Effect here till the 17 <hi>E.</hi> 2. when the
Parliament gave their Lands to the
Hospitallers.<note place="margin">Palm. 222. Walsingh. 1325.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And that the Pope could not by
his Bull dissolve a Vicarage after they
were made perpetual by the Statute;<note place="margin">Cr. 2. 517. Pal. 222.</note>
so that our own Law is to govern in
this matter.</p>
            <p>But what Orders had Exemption
from Tithes by our Law? At first
most of the Orders of Monks had it
for Lands in their own Hands. This
by <hi>Hadrian IV.</hi> was restrained to the
<hi>Cistertians,</hi> Templars and Hospitallers,
which is owned in the Canon Law by
a Decretal of <hi>Alexander III.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Innocent III.</hi> restrains it to such
Lands as they were then in possession
of; but my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> makes the
Grant to be <hi>from</hi> Innocent III.<note place="margin">2 Inst. 652.</note> 
               <hi>in the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:100520:170"/>
Council of</hi> Lateran, 17 John; but he
adds, <hi>That it extends only to the Lands
which they had before;</hi> which was all
that was done then. But he saith,
<hi>That this Privilege was allowed by the
general Consent of the Realm;</hi> however
that were, it is certain that the <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi>
Council made no Restriction to
the three Orders.</p>
            <p>But what shall we say to the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstratenses,</hi>
of whom he saith, <hi>That
they were discharged by a Bull of</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
III. This Point was disputed
in the Case of <hi>Dickenson</hi> and <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>how.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Popham<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </gap>56.</note>
It was not denied, that they
had obtained such a Bull, but it was
denied that it was ever received here.
On the other side, it was said, that
their Bulls were confirmed; which
doth not appear, nor that any Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was given in the Case. There
is a Bull extant in the Collection of
<hi>Innocent</hi>'s Epistles, to exempt the
<hi>Praemonstratenses</hi> from <hi>the Tithes of
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:100520:171"/>
Lands in their own Hands;</hi> but this
was granted in the first year of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi>
III. sometime before the <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi>
Council,<note place="margin">Innocent. 3. Epist. <hi>l.</hi> 1. Ep. 331.</note> and they might enjoy
the same Privileges with the <hi>Cister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi>
if it could be proved, that they
were as generally received, which
hath not yet been done. As to the
<hi>Cistertians</hi> themselves, there are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Limitations of their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges.</p>
            <p>1. They must relate to Lands in
their Possession before the <hi>Lateran
Council, A. D.</hi> 1215. 17 of King
<hi>Iohn.</hi> And in matters against com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Right, the Proof in Reason
ought to be on those who pretend
to particular Privilege. But it's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the <hi>Cistertian</hi> Order hath had
many Lands in <hi>England</hi> since that
time (and it were no hard matter
to find them out.) But, suppose
they were actually discharged at the
Dissolution, and the Proprietaries
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:100520:171"/>
were to enjoy them in the State they
found them, is not this a sufficient
Discharge? Yes, if it be a legal Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge;
for the Statute only puts
them into the same legal Capacity
they were in before; but if they were
Lands given since the <hi>Lateran</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
they were not in a Capacity to
be discharged by Law; for it was not
otherwise received.</p>
            <p>2. This Privilege doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
ancient Compositions, as to
their Demesn Lands. For these Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
did not go down so easily, but
where there were Rectors able to
contest it, they brought even the
<hi>Cistertians</hi> to Compositions. And the
Pope himself appointed Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
here to compound the matter:
As between the Monastery of <hi>Pipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
and <hi>Hugh Patesbul</hi> Rector of
<hi>Eltyndon,</hi> which ended in a Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of six Marks <hi>per Annum</hi> for
the Tithes of their Demesns. And
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:100520:172"/>
another between the Vicar of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church</hi>
and the same Monastery; and
between the Rector of <hi>Wynswick</hi> for
the Tithes of Ten Yard-Lands in
<hi>Colds-Abbey.</hi> All which I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used
in the Register of that Monastery
<hi>MS.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The Privilege doth not hold
where the Monasteries were under Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,<note place="margin">Coke R. 2. 47.</note>
and came to the King by the
Statute 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. unless they were
continued,<note place="margin">Moor, 420.</note> and came within the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of Dissolution,<note place="margin">Cr. Car. 424.</note> 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. And it
ought to be proved that they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
separate; for if their Lands
were given to the greater Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
they did not retain the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
upon Dissolution.</p>
            <p>But there is a much harder point
concerning the Hospitallers (who had
the Lands of the Templers after 17 <hi>E.
2.)</hi> Their Lands were not given
to the King by the Statute of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. but 32 <hi>H. 8. c.
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:100520:172"/>
24.</hi> and the Clause of Exemption
was left out of the Grant. Upon
which a great Question hath risen,
Whether their Lands are exempt or
not? And Judgment was given against
them in the Case of <hi>Cornwallis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cr. 2. 58.</note> or
<hi>Quarles</hi> and <hi>Spurling.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Moor, 913.</note> But in the Case
of <hi>Whiston</hi> and <hi>Weston,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iones, 186</note> it was argued,
That the King had the same Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
which the Hospitallers had.
But it was replied, That other Lands
given to the King after that Act, had
not those Privileges, as <hi>Chanteries,</hi> &amp;c.
It was said, that it was, <hi>because they
were not regular Ecclesiastical Bodies:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bridgm. 33.</note>
Which was a strange Answer, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
what sort of Ecclesiastical
Bodies the <hi>Hospitallers</hi> made,<note place="margin">Latch. 89.</note> when
only the Grand Master and two
Chaplains are bound to be <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rolls. R. 2. 40<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>
and in Foreign Judicatures
they were denied to be any part of
the Clergy,<note place="margin">Selden <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>Tithes, 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> being only an Order of
Knights under some particular Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:100520:173"/>
But suppose them capable of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations
of Tithes, yet when the
Body is dissolved, the Appropriation
falls of it self, unless continued by
Act of Parliament, as those of the
Templars were to them; and those
of the Monasteries by 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. but
where there is no Clause to continue
the Appropriation, it must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
to be left to the natural Course
of things, and so the Appropriation
sinks.</p>
            <p>III. The third legal Exemption is
from Prescription, and ancient Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions.
This seems a difficult Case,
because something less than the real
Value is to be taken, and the Rule
in <hi>Lyndwood</hi> is,<note place="margin">Lynd. f. 101.</note> 
               <hi>non valet consuetudo, ut
minus quam Decima solvatur;</hi> but in
all such Prescriptions and Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
there is less than the true Value.</p>
            <p>To clear this matter, I shall
shew,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="311" facs="tcp:100520:173"/>
1. That by our Ecclesiastical Law,
all Compositions are not condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>2. That by the Common Law
all Prescriptions are not allowed. And
if these things be made out, it will
follow, that where the Compositions
and Prescriptions are legal, the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
may with good Conscience sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to them, as they do in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Law.</p>
            <p>1. As to the Ecclesiastical Law,
<hi>Lyndwood</hi> himself makes these Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations;</p>
            <p>1. In case of personal Tithes.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lynd.</hi> f. 97. b. <hi>c.</hi> Consuc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> f. 99.</note> He
grants that as to them, a Man may
with a good Conscience observe the
Custom although it be under the
real Value. Now these are founded
on the same Laws that <hi>Praedial</hi> and
<hi>Mixt Tithes</hi> are; and by the Stat.
2 <hi>E. 6. c.</hi> 13. they are reduced to a
customary Payment before <hi>Easter,</hi>
               <pb n="312" facs="tcp:100520:174"/>
as it had been used Forty Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
But besides these there were
Offerings to be compounded for,
and the <hi>Easter</hi> Duties are a kind of
Composition for personal Tithes.</p>
            <p>2. In small Tithes, the customary
Payment is allowed. The Payment
in <hi>Lyndwood</hi>'s time, was 6 <hi>ob.</hi> for
Six Lambs, because it was the Tenth
of the Value at that time of a Lamb
of a year old;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lynd.</hi> f. 98.</note> the Seventh Lamb
was to be paid in kind, for which
3 <hi>ob.</hi> were to be paid back, because
three Lambs were wanting of the
Number Ten. But can any one
believe that 5 <hi>d.</hi> was the true Value
then of a Lamb of a year old? And
<hi>Lyndwood</hi> doth not suppose it be the
exact Value; but it was such as the
Provincial Constitution determined,
and he allows Compositions <hi>super mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutis
Decimis.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lynd.</hi> f. 97. b.</note>
            </p>
            <p>3. Compositions were allowed
with the Bishop's Consent with Lay-persons
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:100520:174"/>
for their Tithes. As to what
is past, there was no doubt; but for the
future he saith, it doth not hold <hi>sine
Iudicis auctoritate;</hi> which implies,
that by his Consent it may. And if
so, then a <hi>Modus decimandi</hi> so quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
is allowed by the Ecclesiastical
Law. Such Compositions as these
were entred into the Bishop's Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stries,
and if they were then made
upon a valuable Consideration at
that time, I doubt the Force of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
will get the better of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that may be taken from the great
Difference of Valuation of things.</p>
            <p>2. Let us now consider what Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions
and Compositions are not
allowable at Common Law.</p>
            <p>1. No Prescription <hi>de non deciman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi>
is allowed among Lay-persons,
because none but spiritual Persons are
by the Law capable of Tithes in their
own Right. <hi>A Lay-man,</hi> saith Mr.
<hi>Selden, cannot be discharged of all Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:100520:175"/>
by meer Prescription,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Selden of Tithes, <hi>p.</hi> 409.</note> 
               <hi>unless he
begin the Prescription in a Spiritual
Person.</hi> And to the same purpose
our great Lawyers speak.<note place="margin">Coke R. 2. 44.</note> But in the
famous Case of <hi>Pigot</hi> and <hi>Hern,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cr. 2. 47.</note> a
Distinction was found out,<note place="margin">Rolls, 653.</note> which
may prove of dangerous Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,<note place="margin">Moor, 531, 425.</note>
               <hi>viz.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hob. 297.</note> That although the Lord
of a Manor cannot prescribe for
Tithes, because he is not capable of
them by our Law, yet he may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
for a tenth Shock,<note place="margin">Cr. El. 599.</note> as a <hi>Profit
apprendre,</hi> as a thing appurtenant to
his Manor; and so he may have <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimam
garbam,</hi> but not <hi>Decimas gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barum.</hi>
Upon which Resolution it is
said in the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi>'s
Case,<note place="margin">2 R. 45.</note> That the Lord of a Manor
may have Tithes as appurtenant to
his Manor: For which there is no
Foundation in our Ancient Laws or
Customs, that I can find, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with what is before ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
that none but Spiritual
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:100520:175"/>
persons are capable of Tithes. But in
plain Truth, this Case is not truly
represented; and my Lord Chief
Justice <hi>Hobart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hob. 300.</note> a person of great
Judgment and Learning in the Law,
hath told the World, That this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Reporter hath sometimes given
his own Opinion, and that sudden,
instead of the Resolution of the
Court, which must take much off
from the Authority of his Reports;
especially when the Case is differently
reported by others; as it falls out in
this Case. For Serjeant <hi>Moor,</hi> who
was of Councel in that Case, saith,
That the Defendant pleaded a <hi>Modus
decimandi</hi> in Satisfaction for Tithes,<note place="margin">Moor, 483.</note>
which was 6 <hi>s. per Annum:</hi> But as
to the other point, Whether such an
Ancient <hi>Modus</hi> being made with the
Lord of a Manor, binds the Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders,
it is out of our way; but sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there ought to be good Proof, that
the <hi>Modus</hi> was made before the Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:100520:176"/>
holds were granted, which is not
offered, but only that <hi>it might be so;</hi>
which deserves no other Answer, but
that it might not be so. And it is
hard indeed, when Judgments are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon Possibilities. And for the
Distinction of <hi>decima Garba</hi> and <hi>Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae
Garbarum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Moor, 278.</note> in a Composition for
Tithes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Seld.</hi> p. 398.</note> is the same thing. Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi>
as to this Case of <hi>Pigot</hi> and <hi>Hern,</hi>
saith, <hi>It was an Inheritance of Tithes
from immemorial time, by Virtue of an
Ancient Composition.</hi> And he would
not understand the Judges in any
other Sense: For no kind of Infeoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Tithes is allowable here, he
saith, so as to create in Lay-men a
perpetual Right to them (except
only by the Statute of Dissolution of
Monasteries) unless it be derived
from some Ancient Grant of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
from the Parson, Patron and
Ordinary, with a Consideration of
Recompence to the Parson; and that
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:100520:176"/>
either from time immemorial, or
Ancient Composition. And to the
same purpose he speaks in another
place,<note place="margin">P. 285.</note> where he owns, that by our
Law every Parson had a common
Right to the Tithes of all annual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
<hi>(Praedial</hi> or <hi>Mixt)</hi> within the
limits of his Parish; and any Title
or Discharge must be specially plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>2. Where a Prescription is pleaded
<hi>de Modo decimandi,</hi> the actual Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
by Composition must be shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
For, as my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> saith, a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus
decimandi</hi> is intended as a yearly
Sum in way of Satisfaction for the
Tithes to the Parson;<note place="margin">Select Cases, 43.</note> which <hi>Rolls</hi>
calls the <hi>Actual Recompence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the</hi> Register <hi>the Account of the</hi>
Modus decimandi <hi>is thus set down:</hi>
1. There was a real Composition,<note place="margin">Registr. 38. <hi>b.</hi>
               </note> as
Four Acres of Land for some small
Tithes. 2. There was an Agreement
in Writing, by the Consent of Ordinary and
Patron.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="318" facs="tcp:100520:177"/>
               <hi>But my Lord</hi> Coke <hi>saith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Inst. 490.</note> the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
may as well be for a Sum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
as for Land.</p>
            <p>Suppose no Ancient Composition
in Writing can be produced, how far
doth a Prescription hold?</p>
            <p>1. It must be <hi>immemorial,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bulst. 2. 238.</note> or time
out of mind. Here a great Point
arises fit to be considered: Suppose
the thing it self hath been within Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
as Improvements by Hops,
Fruit-trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth not a Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
bind in this Case?</p>
            <p>I answer, that we are to distinguish
<hi>Personal Contracts</hi> from <hi>Real Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
               <note place="margin">March, 87.</note>
In the Case of <hi>Hitchcock</hi> and
<hi>Hitchcock,</hi> there was a Contract be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Vicar and Parishio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
but it was denied to be a real
Composition, although confirmed
by the Ordinary, and affirmed not to
be binding to the Successors.</p>
            <p>A Composition by a meer verbal
Agreement in the Case of <hi>Hawles</hi> and<note place="margin">Hob. 176.</note>
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:100520:177"/>
               <hi>Bayfield</hi> was declared to be neither
binding to the Party nor his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors.
But in the Case of <hi>Tanner</hi> and
<hi>Small</hi> it was declared to hold for
Years,<note place="margin">Yelv. 94, 95.</note> but not for Life.</p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>Coke</hi> seems to be of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
That if it be a Prescription,
it must be time out of Memory of
Man;<note place="margin">2 Inst. 653.</note> but that a real Composition
may be either before,<note place="margin">Select Cases, 40.</note> or within Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of Man; but then it must be
by Parson,<note place="margin">2 Inst. 655.</note> Patron,<note place="margin">Loon. 1. 151.</note> and Ordinary.</p>
            <p>It is well observed by Sir <hi>Simon
Degge</hi> in his useful Book about these
matters,<note place="margin">Parson's Coun.</note> that although real Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
are supposed in Law to be
the Foundation of Prescriptions <hi>de
Modo decimandi,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Part. 2. c. 20.</note> where the Patron,
Ordinary and Parson did consent to
them; yet that the most of them
have grown up by the Negligence
and Carelesness of the Clergy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
which, I am afraid, is too
true.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="320" facs="tcp:100520:178"/>
And he is of Opinion, That no
real Composition can be made now
to bind the Successor, since the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
13 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 10. which restrains
all binding Grants to One and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Years, or Three Lives; and if so,
then the Consent of Patron and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
cannot make it good.</p>
            <p>2. It must be reasonable, and
therefore it hath been rejected in these
Cases:</p>
            <p>1. If it be a Prescription to pay
a certain Tithe without the Parson's
View of the Nine Parts, because, saith
<hi>Hobart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hob. 107.</note> it is against the Law of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,<note place="margin">Rolls, 647.</note>
in the Case of <hi>Wilson</hi> and the
Bishop of <hi>Carlisle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. If there be no Recompence to
the Parson,<note place="margin">Rolls, 649.</note> as in the Case of <hi>Scory</hi>
and <hi>Barber,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cr. El. 276.</note> the Prescription was
founded on the Parishioners finding
Straw for the Body of the Church.<note place="margin">March, 65.</note>
            </p>
            <p>3. If it be for paying only what
was due in lieu of other Tithes; as
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:100520:178"/>
in the Case of <hi>Ingoldsby</hi> and <hi>Iohnson,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cr. Eliz. 786.</note>
that they paid their other Tithes in
lieu of Tithes of dry Cattel;<note place="margin">C. Select Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, 45.</note> or in
Case a Load of Hay be prescribed
for in lieu of Tithe-Hay,<note place="margin">Bulst. 2. 238.</note> or Ten
Sheafs of Corn for the Tithe of all
the rest.</p>
            <p>4. If it be not for something cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and durable.<note place="margin">Hob. 40.</note> For this, saith <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bart,</hi>
shews an Original Weakness in
the Composition; being of a thing
certain and durable for that which is
not so.</p>
            <p>IV. The last Exemption or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
that is pleaded as to the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Tithes, is Unity of Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session:
That is, where a Monastery
had the Right of Tithes by Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation,
and had other Lands which
did not pay Tithes, because the
owners were to receive them, these
were actually free at the time of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution;
and the Question is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:100520:179"/>
they are legally so by Virtue of
the Statute? It cannot be denied, that
Unity of Possession is in it self no le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Discharge; but whether by the
Words of the Statute the Judges were
divided in Opinion.<note place="margin">Moor, 47.</note> But afterwards
in the Case of <hi>Green</hi> and <hi>Bosekin</hi> the
Judges allowed it,<note place="margin">420.</note> so it were not a
meer Unity of Estate, but of Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.<note place="margin">C. R. 2. 47.</note>
               <hi>Hobart</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Moor, 533.</note> That after it
had been long controverted,<note place="margin">Mob. 298.</note> it was
received as the common Opinion.
<hi>Coke,</hi>
               <note place="margin">11 R. 14.</note> That where Unity of Possession
gives a Discharge, the Title must be
clear, the Non-payment general, and
the Prescription time out of Memory;
but if the Appropriation were made
in the time of <hi>Ed. 4. H.</hi> 6. it could
not be discharged by Unity; nor if
it were a late Abby-prescription.</p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavoured to lay
this matter before you as briefly and
clearly as I could, from the best
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:100520:179"/>
Light I could get, that I might give
you such Directions, that you may
neither run into needless and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Suits, nor be run down by frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Pretences. It is your great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
that you have the Law of
your side, if you understand it a
right; but have a care of being set on
by such, whose Interest it is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Suits; and I am sure it is yours
to prevent them, <hi>if it be possible,
and as much as lies in you.</hi> The
Church's Right is not to suffer by
your Negligence; and you are not
to make the Church to suffer by your
Contentions. He that loves going
to Law, seldom fails of having e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
of it; he suffers in his Purse,
in his Reputation, in his Interest,
and the Church suffers by his Means.
Endeavour to gain, as much as may
be, the Love of your People by a
kind, modest, courteous and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Behaviour, which is the best
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:100520:180"/>
way to prevent, or to compose Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.
If you are forced to sue for
your Maintenance, let them see that
you are forced to it, and that you
are always willing to put an end to
all such Disputes, if the Church's
Right be secured, which you are bound
to preserve.</p>

            <head>OF THE
OBLIGATION
To observe the
Ecclesiastical CANONS
AND
CONSTITUTIONS,
AT
A VISITATION
<date>October 29<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 1696.</date>
            </head>
            <p>IN speaking clearly and distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to this Case, there are these
two Things to be considered;</p>
            <p>I. By what Authority they do
oblige,</p>
            <p>II. In what Way and Manner they
oblige.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="326" facs="tcp:100520:181"/>
I. The first thing to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is the Authority by which Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Canons and Constitutions
do oblige. For, if there be not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Authority, there cannot be
that Obligation on Conscience, which
supposes a legal Exercise of Power,
or a just Right to command. Our
Obedience to the Orders of our
Superiours, is due by Virtue of that
Divine Law which requires us to
<hi>be subject for Conscience-sake:</hi> But our
Obedience is to be regulated <hi>by the
Order of Iustice,</hi> i.e. it ought to be
according to Law. Therefore it is
necessary, in the first place, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
Whether there be among us
any such things as <hi>Ecclesiastical Laws,
i.e.</hi> such Rules, which according to
the Constitution of our Government,
we are bound to observe.</p>
            <p>For we are Members of a Church
established by Law; and there are
legal Duties incumbent on us, with
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:100520:181"/>
respect, not only to the Laws of God,
but of the Realm. For, although
our Office and Authority, as Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
hath a higher Original; yet
the Limitation of the Exercise of it,
is within such Bounds as are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and fixed by the Law of the
Land.</p>
            <p>It is therefore a matter of great
Consequence to us to understand how
far our Ecclesiastical Constitutions
are grounded upon the Law of the
Land, which cannot be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
searching into the Foundations of
our Laws.</p>
            <p>Which lie in three Things: 1. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorial
Custom. 2. General Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
and Allowance. 3. Authority of
Parliament.</p>
            <p>And I shall endeavour to shew
how far our Ecclesiastical Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are founded on these.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="328" facs="tcp:100520:182"/>
1. Immemorial Custom. <hi>Our greatest
Lawyers allow Ancient Custom to be
one of the Foundations of our Laws;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Inst. 11. b. 115. b. 344.</note>
               <hi>and my Lord</hi> Coke <hi>calls it</hi> one of the
main Triangles of the Laws of <hi>England.
I suppose he means</hi> Foundations. <hi>And
another saith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Preface to 4 R.</note> 
               <hi>That</hi> the Common Law
of <hi>England</hi> is nothing else but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Custom of the Realm.<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Iohn Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis</hi> Pref.</note> 
               <hi>My Lord
Chief Justice</hi> Hales <hi>saith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hales Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Analy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis of the Law, <hi>MS.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>That</hi> the
common Usage, Custom and Practice
of the Kingdom, is one of the main
Constituents of our Law.<note place="margin">1 Inst. 110. <hi>b.</hi>
               </note> Coke <hi>quotes</hi>
Bracton'<hi>s Authority to prove, That</hi>
Custom obtains among us the Force of a
Law, where it is received and approved
by long Use. And of every Custom, <hi>he
saith,</hi> there be two Essential Parts,
Time and Usage; Time out of Mind,
and continual and peaceable Usage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Interruption. <hi>But in Case of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
or Custom, he saith, That</hi>
an Interruption of Ten or Twenty Years
hinders not the Title,<note place="margin">1 Inst. 114. b.</note> but an Interruption
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:100520:182"/>
in the Right; <hi>the other is only an
actual</hi> Suspension for a time.</p>
            <p>It may be asked, How Time and
Usage come to make Laws, since
<hi>Time hath no Operation in Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Grot. de</hi> J. B. <hi>&amp;</hi> P. l. 2. c. 4. Sect. 1.</note> saith
<hi>Grotius?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not of it self,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> there saith,
but with the Concurrence of other
Circumstances it may.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bracton</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Bract. l. 1. c. 3.</note> 
               <hi>longa possessio parit
jus possidendi;</hi> and by a long and
peaceable Possession Dominion is
transferred, without either Title or
Delivery; which he founds on this
good Reason,<note place="margin">L. 2. c. 22. n. 1.</note> That all Claims of
Right ought to have a certain Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Time,<note place="margin">L. 4. c. 17. n. 5. c. 40.</note> and length of Time
takes away any Proof to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
<hi>Littleton</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Littl. Ten. <hi>Sect.</hi> 170.</note> 
               <hi>That Time out of
Memory of Man, is said to give Right,
because no Proof can be brought beyond
it.</hi> And this he calls <hi>Prescription at
Common Law,</hi> as it is distinguished from
<hi>Prescription</hi> by the several Statutes of
Limitations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="330" facs="tcp:100520:183"/>
But whence is it then, that an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorial
Possession gives Right?</p>
            <p>Is it from the meer <hi>Silence</hi> of the
Parties concerned to claim it? No,
<hi>Silence</hi> gives no Consent, where Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
or Fear may be the Cause
of it. And is it a Punishment upon
the Neglect of the Party concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
So <hi>Bracton</hi> saith, <hi>Time doth it
per patientiam &amp; negligentiam veri
Domini.</hi> But meer Neglect doth
not overthrow Right, unless there
be an antecedent Law to make that
Neglect a Forfeiture?</p>
            <p>Is it from a <hi>Presumptive Derelicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi>
But that supposes not bare Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of Time, but some kind
of voluntary Act, which implies a
sort of Consent which doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in this Case. And it is a great
Mistake in those, who think there is
no <hi>Presumptive Dereliction,</hi> where
there is not a full Consent; for it
may be, where there is the Consent
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:100520:183"/>
of a <hi>mixt Will, i.e.</hi> partly <hi>voluntary,</hi>
and partly <hi>involuntary;</hi> when the
Circumstances are such, as the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
rather chuses to leave his Right,
than submit to the lawful Conditions
of enjoying it: As if a Man would
rather quit his Fee than perform the
Service which belongs to it.</p>
            <p>Is it from the common Interest of
Mankind, that some Bounds be fixed
to all Claims of Right? Because o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
that Men will be liable to
perpetual Disturbance, if the Right
be permitted to be claimed beyond
any possibility of Proof.</p>
            <p>Or is it, lastly, that in such Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
where immemorial Custom
obtains the Force of a Law, it seems
agreeable to the Foundations of
Law, that a long continued Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
should carry Right along with
it.</p>
            <p>And this was the Case here in
<hi>England,</hi> as not only appears by
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:100520:184"/>
what <hi>Bracton</hi> hath said,<note place="margin">Glanv. Prol.</note> but <hi>Glanvil</hi>
makes a great part of our Law to
consist of reasonable Customs of
long Continuance. And St. <hi>Germain</hi>
affirms Ancient general Customs to
be one of the principal Foundations
of our Law;<note place="margin">Dr. and St. c. 7.</note> and that they have the
Force of Laws, and that the King
is bound by his Oath to perform
them. And it is worth our while to
observe what general Customs he
doth instance in; as the Courts of
Equity and Law, the Hundred Court,
the Sheriffs Turn, the Court Baron,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> which depend not upon Acts
of Parliament, but the Ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of <hi>England,</hi> which he calls the
<hi>Common Law.</hi> And among these
Ancient Customs, he reckons up
Rights of Descent, Escheats, the
different sorts of Tenures, Freeholds,
and the Laws of Property, as they
are received among us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="333" facs="tcp:100520:184"/>
We are now to enquire, how far
any of our Ecclesiastical Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
can be said to be built upon
this Foundation; and upon imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial
Custom generally received.</p>
            <p>1. I place (1.) the Distribution of
this National Church into two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
in each whereof there is an
Archbishop with Metropolitical Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
which lies chiefly in these things,
(1.) The Right of Consecration of
his Suffragans. (2.) The Right of
Visitation of every Diocess in such
Way and Manner as Custom hath
settled it. (3.) The Right of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Appeals from Inferiour Courts
of Judicature in Ecclesiastical Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
(4.) The Right of presiding in
Provincial Councils of the Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
of his Province; which by the
most Ancient Constitutions of this
Church, were to be held once a
Year; so it was decreed in the
Council under <hi>Theodore,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Spel. Con. I. p. 153.</note> 
               <hi>A. D.</hi> 673.
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:100520:185"/>
but by the Difficulties of the times,
they were discontinued; and so the
Authority of examining things
through the Province, came by a
kind of Devolution to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
and his Courts. (5.) The
Custody of vacant Sees, by the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of <hi>England,</hi> falls to the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan,
if there hath been no Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
or Composition to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
And so it hath been upon so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </note> 
               <hi>There was no Pretence of common
Right for them, till the time of</hi> Boniface
VIII.</p>
            <p>2. The ordinary Jurisdiction of
every Bishop over the Clergy of his
own Diocess. This is as ancient as
Christianity among us. For no sooner
were Churches planted, but there
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:100520:185"/>
were Bishops set over them; who
had from the Beginning so much
Authority, that none of the Clergy
could either receive or quit his
Benefice without their Consent and
Approbation; and they were all
bound to give an Account of their
Behaviour at their Visitations; and
in case of Contempt, or other Misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meamours,
they were to proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them according to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of the Church. I do not say
the Diocesses were at first all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delled
alike, or with the same Bounds
which they now have; which was
unreasonable to suppose, considering
the gradual Conversion of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For at first there was but one
Bishop in every one of the <hi>Saxon</hi>
Kingdoms, except <hi>Kent,</hi> where was
but one Suffragan to the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan
for some time, till the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
came to be united; or the
Kings consented to an Increase of
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:100520:186"/>
several Diocesses, and uniting them
under one Metropolitan, which was
a Work of Time. But in all the
<hi>Saxon</hi> Councils we find no mention
of any Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, but
what was in the Bishops themselves,
<hi>Concil. Cloveshoo, Can. 1, 4, 5. Concil.
Cealchyth. Can. 1. Egbert Canon. c. 45,
62.</hi> The first who began to seek
for Exemptions, were the Abbots,
who were under the Bishop's Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
who was too near them;
and therefore they endeavoured to get
under the Pope's immediate Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
by Charters of Exemption,
which the great Abbies either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
or made; and the more <hi>Ancient</hi>
the more <hi>Suspicious.</hi> But the Lord
Chancellor and three Chief Judges
declared,<note place="margin">Moor, R. 783.</note> That by the Common Law
of <hi>England,</hi> every Bishop in his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
and the Archbishops in Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
may make Canons to bind
within the Limits of their Jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:100520:186"/>
3. The subordinate Jurisdiction
which was lodged in the Bodies of
the Clergy resident in Cathedral
Churches, and of Archdeacons in
the several Diocesses: I cannot find
either of these to have had any Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
here before the Conquest,
neither were there any Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
out of the several Counties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
for all <hi>Causes</hi> were transacted
in the <hi>County-Courts</hi> and <hi>Sheriffs Turns,</hi>
and Appeals lay from them to the
Supreme Judicature of the King and
the Lords. But this doth not hinder
but these Courts may be founded on
the Law of <hi>England.</hi> And so the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
Jurisdiction, which of Right
belonged to the Bishop, might by
degrees, and a gradual Consent, come
to be committed, as to some parts,
to the Bodies of Cathedral Churches,
and to the Archdeacons, who are,
saith my Lord <hi>Coke,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Inst. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> Sixty in <hi>England.</hi>
We are told in a late Case of
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:100520:187"/>
               <hi>Woodward</hi> and <hi>Fox,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ventris, II. 189. 269.</note> 
               <hi>That there are
Archdeaconries in</hi> England <hi>by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
which have no Dependency on
the Bishop, but are totally exempt.</hi>
And for this <hi>Godolphin</hi> is cited,<note place="margin">Godol. 61, 65.</note> who
refers to the <hi>Gloss</hi> on the <hi>Legatine
Constitutions, f.</hi> 27. where we read of
<hi>some Archdeacons having a customary
and limited Iurisdiction separate from
the Bishop, for which a Prescription
lies.</hi> But this is only for some <hi>special
Iurisdiction;</hi> as the Archdeacon of
<hi>Richmond</hi> for <hi>Institutions,</hi> which came
first by Grant from the Bishops; but
that not being to be produced, they
insist upon Custom and Prescription,
as the Deans and Chapters do, where
the Ancient Compositions are lost.
But none who understand the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Constitution of this Church, can
suppose either of them to have been
Original, since the Right to the Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the Diocess was in the
Bishop, before there were here either
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:100520:187"/>
               <hi>Archdeacons</hi> or <hi>Chapters</hi> with Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.<note place="margin">Rolls R. 2. 150.</note>
In the Case of <hi>Chiverton</hi> and
<hi>Trudgeon,</hi> it was declared, That an
Archdeacon might have a peculiar
Jurisdiction, as to Administration,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the Dean of St. <hi>Paul's</hi> had at
S. <hi>Pancras;</hi> and so the Archdeacon
of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> as to Wills. In the case
of <hi>Gastril</hi> and <hi>Iones</hi> the Chief Justice
declared, That the Archdeacon is
the Bishop's Officer, and his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
subordinate to the Bishops,<note place="margin">443.</note> and
granted by them; but if special Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
be pleaded, that must be well
proved; to which <hi>Dodderidge</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed.</p>
            <p>But we must distinguish between
<hi>Archdeaconries by Prescription,</hi> for which
I can find no Foundation (being all
derived by Grant from the Bishop)
and <hi>Archdeacons</hi> having some kind
of <hi>Iurisdiction by Prescription,</hi> which
others have not; which cannot be
denied. All the Power which the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:100520:188"/>
               <hi>Archdeacons</hi> have by virtue of their
Office, is <hi>per modum scrutationis sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Offic. Archdiac.</note>
as <hi>Lyndwood</hi> speaks, <hi>tanquam
Vicarius Episcopi:</hi> Whatever Power
they have beyond this, is not <hi>Iure
communi,</hi> but <hi>Iure speciali,</hi> and depends
either upon Grant or Custom;
which the <hi>Gloss</hi> on the <hi>Legatine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions</hi>
calls <hi>a limited Iurisdiction.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gloss. in Const. Oth. <hi>p.</hi> 27.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Archdeacon's Court <hi>is declared
by the Judges in</hi> Woodward'<hi>s Case,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ventris, II. 269.</note> 
               <hi>to
have been,</hi>
               <note place="margin">4 Inst. 339.</note> time out of Mind, settled
as a distinct Court, from which there lies
an Appeal to the Bishop's Court, <hi>by the
Statute,</hi> 24 H. 8. c. 12.</p>
            <p>And so the <hi>Archdeacon</hi>'s Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is founded on an immemorial
Custom, in Subordination to the
Bishops.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>Deans</hi> and <hi>Chapters,</hi> I observe
these things:</p>
            <p>1. <hi>That although Ecclesiastical
Bodies in Cathedrals were very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
yet we read not of any Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:100520:188"/>
peculiar to themselves, during
the</hi> Saxon <hi>times.</hi>
               <note place="margin">3 R. 75.</note> 
               <hi>My Lord.</hi> Coke
<hi>saith,</hi> There were Chapters, as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's
Council, before they had distinct
possessions. And by their Books, <hi>he saith,</hi>
it appears, that the Bishops parted with
some of their Possessions to them, and
so they became Patrons of the Prebends
of the Church: <hi>Such were</hi> London,
York <hi>and</hi> Litchfield.</p>
            <p>2. That several of our Chapters
were founded and endowed by the
Bishops since the Conquest: Such
was that of <hi>Salusbury</hi> by <hi>Osmund</hi> out
of his own Estate, as appears by his
Charter, and the Confirmation of
<hi>H.</hi> 2. So was that of <hi>Lincoln</hi> by <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migius,</hi>
who removed the See from
<hi>Dorchester</hi> thither, and placed there a
Dean, Treasurer, Praecentor, and
Seven Archdeacons, as <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingdon</hi>
saith, who lived near the
time. And in following times those
of <hi>Exeter</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi> were settled as
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:100520:189"/>
               <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter;</hi> for they were Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Bodies before, but not
under that Denomination.</p>
            <p>3. That some had the legal Rights
of <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapters,</hi> as to Election
of Bishops, and Confirmation of
Leases, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but were a Monastick
Body consisting of Prior and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent:
Such were <hi>Canterbury, Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
Worcester,</hi> after the Expulsion
of the Secular Canons; for the Monks
not only enjoyed their Lands, but
were willing enough to continue
the Name of <hi>Dean</hi> among them
As at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> after <hi>Dunstan</hi>'s time,
<hi>Agelmothas</hi> is called <hi>Dean;</hi> in <hi>Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Wolstan</hi> is called <hi>Dean</hi> when he

Bishop by their Foundation.<note place="margin">Anderson, II. 120.</note> Now
as to these, it is resolved in the <hi>Dean</hi>
and <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Norwich</hi>'s Case, That
when the King transferred them
from a <hi>Prior</hi> and <hi>Convent,</hi> the <hi>Legal
Rights</hi> remained the same.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Inst.</hi> 102. b.</note> And in
<hi>Hayward</hi> and <hi>Fulcher</hi>'s Case,<note place="margin">3 R. 75.</note> the
Judges declared,<note place="margin">Palmer, 501.</note> That <hi>an Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cal
Body may surrender their Lands,
but they cannot dissolve their Corporation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iones, 168.</note>
               <hi>but they still remain a Chapter to the
Bishop.</hi> And it was not only then
delivered, but since insisted upon
in a famous Case,<note place="margin">Quo Warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, 14.</note> 
               <hi>That it was the
Resolution of the Iudges, That a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
cannot be made by a Dean and
Chapter, without Consent of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
because he hath an Interest in
them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. That <hi>H.</hi> 8. endowed some as
<hi>Chapters</hi> to new erected Bishopricks,
as <hi>Chester, Bristol, Oxford,</hi> &amp;c. 31 <hi>H.
8, 9. 34 H.</hi> 8. 17. and united others,
as <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> and <hi>Coventry</hi> and
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:100520:190"/>
               <hi>Litchfield, 33 H. 8. 30. 34 H. 8.
15.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. That where the Custom hath
so obtained, there may be a <hi>Legal-Chapter</hi>
without a <hi>Dean;</hi> as in the
Diocesses of S. <hi>David's</hi> and <hi>Landaff,</hi>
where there is no other Head of the
Chapter but the Bishop; but they
must act as a distinct Body in Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Confirmations of Grants
by the Bishops.</p>
            <p>6. That by the Ancient Custom
of <hi>England,</hi> there are sole Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Corporations as well as aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.
A sole Ecclesiastical Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is, where a single Person re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
a whole Succession, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that Capacity is impowered to
Receive and to Convey an Estate to
his Successors: As Bishops, Deans,
Archdeacons,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> Parsons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and Vicars are seized only in
Right of the Church, but as to a
Bishop, <hi>he may have a Writ of Right,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:100520:190"/>
because the Fee-simple abideth in him and
his Chapter;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 645.</note> 
               <hi>and so may a Dean and
Master of an Hospital:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 413.</note> And these are
called <hi>Bodies Politick</hi> by <hi>Littleton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Exercise of the Bishop's
Power may be restrained by ancient
Compositions, as is seen in the two
Ancient Ecclesiastical Bodies of St.
<hi>Paul's</hi> and <hi>Litchfield.</hi> Concerning
which, it is to be observed, That
where the Compositions are extant,
both Parties are equally bound to
observe their parts. Thus by the
Remisness and Absence of the Bishops
of <hi>Litchfield</hi> from their See, by going
to <hi>Chester,</hi> and then to <hi>Coventry,</hi> the
Deans had great Power lodged in
them, as to Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction
there. After long Contests, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
came to a Composition, <hi>A. D.
1428.</hi> by which the Bishops were to
visit them but once in Seven Years,
and the <hi>Chapter</hi> had Jurisdiction o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their own Peculiars. So in the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:100520:191"/>
Church of <hi>Sarum</hi> the Dean hath ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
large Jurisdiction, even out of
the Bishop's Diocess; which makes
it probable to have been very ancient;
but upon contest, it was settled by
Composition between the Bishop,
Dean, and Chapter, <hi>A. D.</hi> 1391.
But where there are no Compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
it depends upon Custom, which
limits the Exercise, although it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deprive the Bishop of his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan-Right.</p>
            <p>4. The Delegate Jurisdiction
which was committed to the several
Officers of the Bishops Courts, and
the Manner of their Proceedings, is
founded upon immemorial Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom.
In the <hi>Saxon</hi> times I find no
Delegation of Ecclesiastical Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;
for the Bishops sate in
person in the County-Courts, and
there heard Ecclesiastical Causes, as
appears by the Charter of <hi>H.</hi> 1.
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:100520:191"/>
when he pretended to restore the
<hi>Saxon</hi> Laws, <hi>c.</hi> 7. But <hi>William</hi> I. had
settled the <hi>Consistory-Court</hi> by as good
a Law as any was made at that time,
distinct from the County-Court, and
required all Ecclesiastical Causes
to be there heard; and his Son <hi>H.</hi> 1.
did but make a shew of restoring the
<hi>Saxon</hi> Laws, and the former Law
came to be generally received; and
so Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> yields,<note place="margin">Selden of Tithes, <hi>p.</hi> 413.</note> that <hi>it grew to
be a general Law;</hi> which shews that
it obtained the Force of a Law by
Consent, as well as by Authority.
The <hi>Consistory-Courts</hi> being thus settled,
and Numbers of Causes there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending,
and the Bishops being then
by <hi>H.</hi> 2. in the Constitutions of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendon</hi>
strictly tied to Attendance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Supreme Courts of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
with other Barons, there came
a Necessity of taking in other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
with a delegated Power to hear
Causes, and to do such other Acts of
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:100520:192"/>
Jurisdiction as the Bishops should
appoint. For it was still allowed that
<hi>Iure communi,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ordenave, <hi>f.</hi> 69.</note> the Jurisdiction was in
the Bishop; but <hi>Iure speciali, &amp; in
auxilium Episcopi,</hi> it might be dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
to others. And so it hath
been here received, and not only
here, but it hath been the general
Practice of Christendom. As to
the manner of Proceeding in the
Ecclesiastical Courts, it is the same
in all Parts, and built on the same
Grounds with those of our Courts of
Equity and Admiralty, which are as
different from those of the Common
Law.</p>
            <p>5. The settling Parochial Rights,
or the Bounds of Parishes depends
upon an ancient and immemorial
Custom. For they were not limited
by any Act of Parliament, nor set
forth by special Commissioners; but
as the Circumstances of Times,
and Places, and Persons did happen
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:100520:192"/>
to make them greater or lesser.</p>
            <p>In some places Parishes seem to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere,
when some place in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of another Parish belongs to one
that is distant; but that hath general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
happened by an Unity of Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
when the Lord of a Manor was
at the Charge to erect a new Church,
and make a distinct Parish of his
own Demesns, some of which lay in
the Compass of another Parish. But
now care is taken by Annual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambulations
to preserve those Bounds
of Parishes, which have been long
settled by Custom. But the Bounds
of Parishes is not allowed to belong
to the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>II. The next Foundation of
Law is a <hi>General Practice,</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance</hi>
i.e. when things of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
do not oblige by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of those that made them;
yet being generally received and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:100520:193"/>
they thereby become Law
to us. This we have in an Act of
Parliament, 25 <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 21. wherein it
is said, That the People of <hi>England</hi>
are only bound to such Laws as are
properly their own, being in Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to no Foreign Legislative
Power. But were not many things
here received for Laws, which were
Enacted by a Foreign Authority, as
the <hi>Papal</hi> and <hi>Legatine Constitutions?</hi>
True, say they, but it is not by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of their Authority, but by the
<hi>free Consent of the People in the Use
and Allowance of them: And so they are
not observed as the Laws of any Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Prince, Potentate, or Prelate, but
as the customed and ancient Laws of
this Realm, originally established as Laws
of the same, by the said Sufferance, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and Custom, and no otherwise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that here we have a full and
express Declaration by Parliament;
That such Canons as have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:100520:193"/>
and allowed by ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
make a part of our Laws,
and continue to oblige, provided
that they be not repugnant to the
King's Prerogative, nor to the Laws,
Statutes, and Customs of the Realm,
as it is expressed in another Act of
the same Parliament, 25 <hi>H. 8. c.
19.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Ecclesiastical Laws, <hi>saith my
Lord</hi> Coke,<note place="margin">1 Inst. 344.</note> are such as are not against
the Laws of the Realm, <hi>viz.</hi> the Common
Law, and the Statutes and Customs of
the Realm: And according to such Laws
the Ordinary and other Ecclesiastical
Iudges do proceed in Causes within their
Conusance.</p>
            <p>So that by the Acknowledgement
of this great Oracle of the Common
Law, there are <hi>Laws Ecclesiastical</hi> in
force among us, and Causes to be
judged by those Laws, and Officers
appointed by the Law to proceed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="352" facs="tcp:100520:194"/>
The <hi>Ecclesiastical Laws</hi> and <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi>
are owned by the Statute, 27
<hi>H. 8. c. 20. 32 H. 8. c. 7. 35 H. 8.
c.</hi> 19. after the Commission appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the Review of them. 1 <hi>E. 6.
c.</hi> 2. The Ecclesiastical Courts are
appointed to be kept by the King's
Authority, and Process to be issued
out in his Name in all Suits and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Instance between Party and
Party, where the Causes are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
mentioned, which belong to
those Courts, and no Alteration is

               <pb n="353" facs="tcp:100520:194"/>
But the plain and short Answer is
this, That there was no need of any
Debate about the Repeal of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of <hi>E.</hi> 6. after the first of Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi>
because then the Statute, 25 <hi>H. 8. c.
20.</hi> was expresly revived, wherein the
Bishops were impowered <hi>to act as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they might have done, according to
the Laws and Customs of the Realm.</hi>
By which no less Men of the Law
than <hi>Coke,</hi>
               <note place="margin">C. 12. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Popham,</hi> and other Judges
did think <hi>the Stile of the Court, and
Manner of their Proceedings was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.</hi>
And the <hi>Ancient Episcopal
Iurisdiction is declared to be according to
Law,</hi> by the Stat. 1 <hi>El. c. 1. and all
Foreign Iurisdiction is abolished, and the
Ecclesiastical Iurisdiction annexed to the
Crown of this Realm;</hi> which is owned
by every Bishop when he takes the
<hi>Oath of Supremacy.</hi> How then can it
be imagined, that he should do any
more to the Prejudice of the Crown,
by the Process being in the Bishop's
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:100520:195"/>
Name, than the Lord of a Manor
doth, when he keeps his Courts in
his own Name? To suppose that
it is owning a <hi>Foreign Iurisdiction,</hi> is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous;
for the Bishops of <hi>England</hi>
never pretended to act as <hi>Ordinaries,</hi>
by Virtue of a Jurisdiction from the
Pope, but by Virtue of their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Authority which they had by the
Laws of the Realm, as to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior
Jurisdictions. And the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
they then acted by from the
Pope, was in Cases <hi>extraordinary,</hi> when
they were delegated by particular
Commission. And if there had been
any real Derogation from the King's
Prerogative, in the Process being
in the Bishop's Name, can any Man
of Sense imagine, that it would have
been permitted in such jealous times
as to <hi>Supremacy,</hi> as the latter end of
<hi>H.</hi> 8. and the whole Reign of Q. <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>
were, wherein the Bishops
wanted not Enemies, but their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:100520:195"/>
would have been too apparent,
if they had insisted on such Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
But to proceed in shewing that
the Ecclesiastical Laws have been
owned by Acts of Parliament since
the Reformation, 2 <hi>E. 6. c. 13. n. 13.
The Ecclesiastical Iudges are required to
proceed according to the King's Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to the same purpose, 1 <hi>El. c.
2. n.</hi> 23.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Accordingly my Lord</hi> Coke <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
owns the</hi> Ecclesiastical Laws
and Iurisdiction,<note place="margin">1 Inst. 11. 4 Inst. 321. Prooem. to 4 Inst.</note> 
               <hi>so they be</hi> bounded by

               <hi>saith he,</hi> there be within this Realm
two distinct Iurisdictions; the one Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical,
limited to certain spiritual and
particular Cases; the other secular and
general, for that it is guided by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

               <pb n="356" facs="tcp:100520:196"/>

            <p>The Pope's Canon for the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy

               <pb n="358" facs="tcp:100520:197"/>
The Pope's Canons about Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals,

were never received by such a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

they were sometimes practised by

they were contested and denied, and

            <p>Some Canons I find disputed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <hi>Lord Chief Justice</hi> Vaughan <hi>saith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vaugh. 21.</note>
               <hi>That</hi> if Canon Law be made a part of

by the same Authority, as any other part
of the Law of the Land.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In another place, That</hi> the Ancient

               <hi>In a third, That</hi> a lawful Canon,

               <pb n="362" facs="tcp:100520:199"/>
               <hi>III. I now come to the third thing,</hi>
viz. The Power of making Canons by
Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is founded on the Statute</hi> 25
H. 8. c. 19. <hi>The Words are, That</hi>
no Canons, Constitutions and Ordinances,
Provincial or Synodal, shall be made,
promulged and executed without the King's
Royal Assent or Licence.</p>
            <p>Canons so made, and authorized by
the King's Letters Patents, according
to the Form of the Statute, <hi>are said
by Lord Chief Justice</hi> Vaughan,<note place="margin">Vaugh. 327.</note> 
               <hi>to be</hi>
Canons warranted by Act of Parliament.
<hi>And such he affirms the Canons of</hi>
A. D. 1603. <hi>to be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But some have objected,</p>
            <p>That these are only Negative
Words,<note place="margin">Bagshaw's Arg. about the Canons, <hi>p.</hi> 10.</note> and are not an Introduction of
a new Law, but a Declaration of what
the Law was before.</p>
            <p>But my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> with far greater
Judgment,<note place="margin">4 Inst. 323.</note> limits that Expression,
<hi>That what was then passed, was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:100520:199"/>
of the Common Law,</hi> to that Clause,
That no Canons should be in Force,
which were repugnant to the Laws
of the Realm.</p>
            <p>But as to the <hi>making of new Canons,</hi>
he only saith, That <hi>their Iurisdiction
and Power is much limited, because they
must have licence to make them, and
the King's Royal Assent to allow them,
before they be put in Execution.</hi> But
he never imagined the Sense of the
Statute to be, That no Canons could
be made but in Parliament, or that
the King had not a Power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
new Canons made by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.</p>
            <p>As to the Law, as it stood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
we must distinguish these two
things;</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Convocations</hi> called by the <hi>King's
Writ</hi> to the Bishops, and the body
of the Clergy, could never assemble
without it. But the Writ for the
Convocation to sit with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:100520:200"/>
(not together in Place, but
at the same time) is contained in
the Writ to the Bishop, and begins
with the Clause, <hi>Praemunientes.</hi> And
it is most probable, that it began on
the same Ground that the Attendance
of Burgesses did, <hi>viz.</hi> That when
they were brought into the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Subsidies, they ought to give
their Consent. For I find, that in
the time of <hi>H. 3. A. R.</hi> 39. the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Clergy</hi> complained,<note place="margin">Annal. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on, 356.</note> 
               <hi>That they
were taxed without their Consent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Convocations</hi> called by the <hi>King's
Writ to the Archbishops;</hi> and in this
Province the Archbishop sends his
<hi>Mandate</hi> to the <hi>Bishop of London,</hi> who
is to summon all the Bishops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to
appear at a certain Time and Place,
and to act as they receive Authority
from the King.</p>
            <p>The not distinguishing these two
<hi>Writs,</hi> hath caused so much Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in some Mens Minds, about the
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:100520:200"/>
Rights of the Convocation: For they
imagine that the <hi>Convocation,</hi> as it
treats of <hi>Ecclesiastical Matters,</hi> sits by
Virtue of the first Writ, which is in
the Bishops Summons to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but that related to them as one
of the three <hi>Estates</hi> of the Realm,
whose Consent was then required to
their own Subsidies, which were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
granted, but confirmed by
the other <hi>Estates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the other Writ was directed
to the Archbishop, by which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Inferiour Clergy were strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
required to appear, and then to
understand the King's further Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
as appears by the most ancient.
Writs for a Convocation. Which
shews, that the Convocation, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so called, is an Occasional Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
for such purposes as the King
shall direct them when they meet.
And this was the true Foundation
upon which the Statute, 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. was
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:100520:201"/>
built. For it cannot be denied, that
in Fact there had been Convocations
for Ecclesiastical Purposes called
without the Kings Writ, by Virtue of
the Archbishop's Legatine Power,
which was permitted to be exercised
here, although it were an Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon the King's Right. So even
in the time of <hi>H.</hi> 8. although there
were a Convocation summoned by
the King's Writ to the Archbishop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> yet Cardinal <hi>Wolsley,</hi> by
Virtue of his Legatine Power, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
to that of the Archbishop,
removed the Convocation to another
place, and presided in it: Which
was as great an Affront to the King's
as well as the Archbishop's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
as could well be imagined. But
this was then patiently born: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Statute is to be understood of
Legal, and not of <hi>Legatine Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="367" facs="tcp:100520:201"/>
But when <hi>H.</hi> 8. was sufficiently
provoked by the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> he
resolved to resume the ancient and
legal Rights of the Crown, how
soever disused by modern Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And among these he claimed
this of summoning the Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and directing the Proceedings
therein.</p>
            <p>The Difference of these Writs will
best appear by the Instance of the
Convocation, <hi>A. D.</hi> 1640.</p>
            <p>In the Year, 1639. about the
first of <hi>February</hi> the Parliament Writ
was issued out to the Bishops for
calling their Clergy to Parliament;
and this is only <hi>ad consentiendum
iis quae tunc ibidem de communi Concilio
Regni nostri contigerint ordinari.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other Writ for the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Archbishops was issued
out the twentieth of <hi>February,</hi> and
had this Clause, <hi>ad tractandum, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiendum,
&amp; concludendum super prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missis
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:100520:202"/>
&amp; aliis quae sibi clarius exponen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur

            </p>
            <p>The Parliament at that time being
dissolved, it's certain the <hi>Convocation</hi>
sitting by Virtue of <hi>the Writ to the
Bishops</hi> must fall with it: But a great
Question arose, Whether the <hi>Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
sitting <hi>by the Writ to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops,</hi>
was dissolved, or not? And
the greatest Judges and Lawyers of
that time were of Opinion it was not.
But those were not times to venture
upon such Points, when people were
disposed to find Fault, as they did, to
purpose when the next Parliament
met; who made use of the Sitting
of this <hi>Convocation</hi> and the <hi>Canons</hi>
then pass'd, as one of the popular
Themes to declaim upon against the
Bishops, and to inflame the Nation
against the whole Order.</p>
            <p>The greatest Objection in Point
of Law, was, That the Commission
had a Respect to the Convocation
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:100520:202"/>
sitting in Parliament-time, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
13 <hi>April</hi> 1640. and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
bore Date <hi>April</hi> 15. the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
was dissolved <hi>May</hi> 5. and
the 12th of <hi>May</hi> a new Commission
was granted, which made void that
of the fifteenth of <hi>April;</hi> and so what
was done by Virtue of that, must
be done out of Parliament, and so
not in Convocation, according to
25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 19. although these Canons
were confirmed by the King's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
the thirtieth of <hi>Iune</hi> the same
Year.</p>
            <p>After the King's Restoration, an
Act of Parliament passed for Resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Bishops Ordinary Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;<note place="margin">13 Car. 2. <hi>c.</hi> 12.</note>
wherein a Clause is added, <hi>That
this Act did not confirm those Canons</hi>
of 1640. but left the Ecclesiastical
Laws as they stood 1639. which
Act being passed by the King's
Assent, it voids the former Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them, and so leaves them
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:100520:203"/>
without Force. But the Alteration
of our Law by the Act, 25 <hi>H. 8.
c.</hi> 19. lay not in this, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
by the King's Writ to the
Archbishop, could not sit but in
Parliament-time (although that in
all respects be the most proper time)
for there is not a Word tending that
way in the Statute; but <hi>Provincial
Councils</hi> having been frequently held
here, without any Writ from the
King, and therein treating of Matters
prejudicial to the Crown, by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of a Legatine Power, there was
great Reason for the King to resume
the ancient Right of the Crown. For
so <hi>William I.</hi> declared it in <hi>Eadmerus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eadmer. Hist. p. 6.</note>
That <hi>nothing should be done in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial
Councils without his Authority.</hi>
But afterwards we find <hi>Hubert,</hi>
Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> holding a
<hi>Provincial Council against the King's
Prohibition;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hoveden, <hi>p.</hi> 806.</note> and several Writs were
sent to them to prohibit their med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling<note place="margin">

in Matters of State in Prejudice
to the Crown, 18 <hi>H.</hi> 3. under Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
of the Bishops forfeiting their
Baronies; and to the like purpose,
35 <hi>E. 1. 15 E. 2. 6 E.</hi> 3. which
seems to be a tacit Permission of
these <hi>Provincial Councils,</hi> provided they
did nothing prejudicial to the Crown.
And from such Councils came our
<hi>Provincial Constitutions,</hi> which <hi>Lynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>
hath digested according to the
Method of the Canon-Law, and hath
therein shewed what part of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-Law
hath any Force here; not
by Virtue of any Papal or Legatine
Power, but by the <hi>General Consent of
the Nation,</hi> by which they have been
received among us.</p>
            <p>But my business is not now with
<hi>Canons</hi> so received, but with <hi>Canons
made according to the Statute, 25 H. 8.
19.</hi> for it is ridiculous to imagine
those are only negative Words, for
then they exclude the King's Power
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:100520:204"/>
of calling a Convocation, as well as
confirming the Acts of it. For to
what purpose is the King's Writ to
call them together, if being assembled
they can do nothing?</p>
            <p>But I have already mentioned my
Lord Chief Justice <hi>Vaughan</hi>'s Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
That <hi>the</hi> Canons <hi>made</hi> A. D.
1603. <hi>are warranted by 25 H. 8. c.
19.</hi> It was urged by the Council in
the Case of <hi>Grove</hi> and <hi>Eliot,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ventris Rep. <hi>II.</hi> 42.</note> 22 <hi>Carol.
2.</hi> That <hi>no</hi> Canons <hi>can alter the Law,
which are not confirmed by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi>
But it was said on the other
side, That <hi>these</hi> Canons <hi>had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
allowed, having been confirmed by
the King.</hi> One of the Judges said,
That <hi>the King and Convocation cannot
make</hi> Canons <hi>to bind the</hi> Laity, <hi>but
only the</hi> Clergy. But <hi>Vaughan</hi> said,
That <hi>those</hi> Canons <hi>are of Force, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
never confirmed by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as no</hi> Canons <hi>are; and yet,</hi> saith
he, <hi>they are the Laws which bind and
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:100520:204"/>
govern in</hi> Ecclesiastick Affairs. <hi>The
Convocation, with the Licence and Assent
of the King, under the Great Seal, may
make</hi> Canons <hi>for Regulation of the
Church, and that as well concerning</hi>
Laicks <hi>as</hi> Ecclesiasticks; and so is
<hi>Lyndwood.</hi> There can be no question
in <hi>Lyndwood</hi>'s time, but Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Constitutions were thought to
bind all that were concerned in them;
and the Ecclesiastical Laws which
continue in Force by Custom and
Consent, bind all; the only Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
then is about making new
Canons, and the Power to make
them, is by Virtue of an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
to which the Nation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented;
and so there need no Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives
of the people in Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
And no such thing can be
inferred from <hi>Moor,</hi> 755. for the
Judges declared <hi>the Deprivation of the
Clergy for not conforming to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
to be legal;</hi> but they say nothing
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:100520:205"/>
of others. But in the Case of <hi>Bird</hi> and
<hi>Smith, f.</hi> 783. the Chancellor and
three Chief Judges declared, That the
Canons made in Convocation by
the King's Authority, without Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
do bind in Ecclesiastical
Matters, as an Act of Parliament.
And therefore I proceed to shew,</p>
            <p>II. In what manner we are obliged
to the Observation of these <hi>Canons;</hi>
concerning which I shall premise two
Things;</p>
            <p>1. That I meddle not with such
<hi>Canons</hi> as are altered by Laws; for
all grant, that unless it be in Moral
Duties, their Force may be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
by the Laws of the Land.</p>
            <p>2. There are some Canons, where
the general Disuse in Matters of no
great Consequence to the Good of
the Church, or the Rights of other
Persons, may abate the Force of the
Obligation; especially when the
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:100520:205"/>
Disuse hath been connived at, and
not brought into Articles of Visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as <hi>Can.</hi> 74. about <hi>Gowns with
standing Collars, and Cloaks with Sleeves.</hi>
But the general Reason continues in
Force, <hi>viz.</hi> That there should be a
decent and comely Habit for the
Clergy, whereby <hi>they should be known
and distinguished by the People;</hi> and
for this, the ancient Custom of the
Church is alledged.</p>
            <p>But here a very material Question
arises, How far Custom is allowed to
interpret and alter the Force of
Canons made by a lawful Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
For where a Custom prevails
against a standing Rule, it amounts
to this, Whether Practice against
Law, is to have more Force than
the Law. And how can there be a
reasonable Custom against a Law
built upon reasonable Grounds?
But on the other side, if Custom
hath no power in this case, then all
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:100520:206"/>
the ancient Canons of the Church do
still bind in Conscience, and so we
must not kneel at our Prayers on
<hi>Sundays,</hi> nor between <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sontide,</hi>
which were thought to be
made upon good Reason at first;
and so many other Canons which
have long grown into a Disuse. So
that if we do strictly oblige persons
to observe all Ecclesiastical Canons
made by lawful Authority, we run
Men into endless Scruples and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities;<note place="margin">Gers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> de Vit. Spirit. Lect. 4. Cor. 13.</note>
and <hi>Gerson</hi> himself grants,
<hi>That many Canons of General Councils
have lost their Force by Disuse, and that
the Observation of them now would be
useless and impossible.</hi> But on the
other side, if meer Disuse were suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
what would become of any
Canons and Constitutions, where
Persons are refractary and Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient?</p>
            <p>This is a Case which deserves to
be stated and cleared. And we are
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:100520:206"/>
to distinguish three sorts of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms.</p>
            <p>1. Customs generally obtaining
upon altering the Reason of ancient
Canons.</p>
            <p>2. Customs allowed upon the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Inconveniency of modern Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons.</p>
            <p>3. Customs taken up without
any Rules or Canons for them.</p>
            <p>1. As to general Customs against
ancient Canons where the Reason is
altered; I see no Ground for any to
set up those Canons, as still in Force,
among us: For this must create Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
and Disorder, which those
Canons were designed to prevent; and
the Laws of the Land do certainly
supersede ancient Canons, wherein
the necessary Duties of Religion are
not immediately concerned. For we
must have a care of setting up ancient
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:100520:207"/>
Canons against the Authority of our
Laws, which cannot be consistent
with our National Obligation, nor
with the Oath of Supremacy.</p>
            <p>2. As to Customs relating to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Canons, if it hath any Force,
as to altering the Obligation.</p>
            <p>1. It must be general; not taken
up by particular dissaffected Persons
to our Constitution; for the Custom
of such Men only shews their wilful
Disobedience and Contempt of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
and all Casuists are agreed,
That Contempt of lawful Authority,
is a wilful Sin: Which supposes a
wilful Neglect upon Knowledge and
Admonition of their Duty. For
Contempt is,<note place="margin">Cajet. Sum. in Verb.</note> 
               <hi>Nolle subjici cui oportet
subjici;</hi> and a lesser Fault commited
with it, is a greater Sin than a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Fault in it self committed without
it, <hi>i.e.</hi> by meer carelesness and inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency.
But where there is an open
and customary Neglect, there is a
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:100520:207"/>
Presumption of Contempt, unless
some great and evident Reason be
produced for it. I do not say the
bare Neglect doth imply Contempt
in it self, but where there is admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
and a continuance after it,
there is a down-right and positive
Contempt. But where the Disuse is
general, not out of Contempt, but
upon other Reasons; and there is no
Admonition by Superiours, but a
tacit Connivence; there is a Presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Consent towards the laying
aside the strict Obligation of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
relating to it.</p>
            <p>2. It must be reasonable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>i.e.</hi> on
such Grounds as may abate the
Force of the Obligation. For there
is a Difference between a Custom ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Force of a Law, and a
Custom abating the Force of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non:
In the former case the Custom
must be grounded on more evident
Reason than is necessary for the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.<note place="margin">So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But how can acts of Disobedience

            <p>
               <hi>Cajetan</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Caj. ad 1. 2.</note> They are to blame
who began it,<note place="margin">Q. 97. <hi>Art.</hi> 3.</note> but not those who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it, when the Custom is general.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Suarez</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Suar. de Leg. <hi>l. 4. c. 16. n.</hi> 9.</note> It is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Opinion.</p>
            <p>The Canonists say, If a Custom
be against a Rule, the Reason must
be plain; if only besides the Rule,
and be not repugnant to the End and
Design, the Reasonableness when it
becomes general, is presumed. But
if the Superiours take notice of it,<note place="margin">Roch. Curt. de Statut.</note>
and condemn it,<note place="margin">Sect. 2. n. 20, 34.</note> it loses the Force of
Custom,<note place="margin">Sect. 7. n. 5, 11, 12, 13.</note> unless a new Reason or high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
authority appear for it.</p>
            <p>3. But what is to be said for Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
taken up without Rules or
Canons; of what Force are they in
Point of Conscience?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="381" facs="tcp:100520:208"/>
1. It is certain, that no late Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
brought in by such as have no
Authority to oblige, can bind others
to follow them. For this were to
lay open a Gap to the introducing
foolish and superstitious Customs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church, which would make
Distinctions without cause, and
make way for Differences and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosities,
which all wise and good
Men will avoid as much as may
be.</p>
            <p>It is a Rule among the Casuists,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Soto,</hi> l. 1. Q. 7. Art. 2.</note>
That voluntary Customs, although
introduced with a good Mind, can
never oblige others to observe them.
And <hi>Suarez</hi> yields, that a bare fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Repetition of Acts cannot bind
others,<note place="margin">Suarez, de LL. <hi>l. 7. c.</hi> 15. 10, 11.</note> although it hath been of long
continuance.</p>
            <p>2. If the Customs be such as are
derived from the primitive times,
and continue in practice, there is no
Reason to oppose, but rather to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:100520:209"/>
with them; or if they tend to
promote a Delight in God's Service.
As for instance:</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Worshipping towards the East,</hi>
was a very ancient Custom in the
Christian Church. I grant that very
insufficient Reasons are given for it;
which <hi>Origen</hi> would not have Men
to be too busie in inquiring into,<note place="margin">Origen. in Numer. Hom. 5.</note> but
to be content that it was a generally
received Practice, even in his time;
and so doth <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him,<note place="margin">Clem. Alex. Str. <hi>l.</hi> 7.</note> who thinks it relates to
Christ, as the Sun of Righteousness.
<hi>Tertullian</hi> and S. <hi>Basil</hi> own the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,<note place="margin">Tertul. Apol. <hi>c.</hi> 16.</note>
and give no Reason.<note place="margin">Basil. de Sp. Sancto <hi>c.</hi> 27.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But of all Customs that of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
and Singularity, where there
is no plain Reason against them, doth
the least become the Church of
God.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Use of Organical Musick in
the Publick Service.</hi> If it tends to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and settle, and raise the Spirits
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:100520:209"/>
of Men in the Acts of Worship, I
see no Reason can be brought against
it. If it be said to be only a natural
Delight, that Reason will hold against
<hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 29. 25.</note> who appointed it by God's
own Commandment. They who
call it <hi>Levitical Service,</hi> can never
prove it to be any of the Typical
Ceremonies, unless they can shew
what was represented by it.</p>
            <p>I come now to the Measure of
the Obligation of the Canons in
Force.</p>
            <p>And therein a great Regard is to
be had to the <hi>Intention</hi> of that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
which enjoyns them; and that
is to be gathered from three Things;</p>
            <p>1. The Matter. 2. The Words
and Sense of the Church. 3. The
Penalty.</p>
            <p>1. As to the Matter. If it be in
it self weighty, and tends to promote
that which is good and pious, and
for the Honour of God, and Service
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:100520:210"/>
of Religion, it cannot be denied but
these Canons do oblige in Conscience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bellarmin</hi> distinguishes between
Laws of the Church,<note place="margin">Bell. de R. D. <hi>l. 14. c.</hi> 18.</note> which, he saith,
are very few, and pious Admonitions
and good Orders, which are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to oblige Men to sin, but
only in case of Contempt and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal.
And as to the Feasts and Fasts
of the Church, which belong to the
Laws, he saith, They have <hi>mitissimam
Obligationem;</hi> so any one would think,
who considers how many are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted,
and for what Reasons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gerson</hi> saith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>De Vit. Spir.</hi> Lect. 4. Cor. 1.</note> That no human Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
bind as to moral Sin, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it be founded on the Law of God;
as he confesses the Church's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is, as to circumstances; and
then he thinks it obliges in Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.<note place="margin">Coroll. 6.</note>
The Substance of his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which hath been much disputed
and controverted by Modern Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suists,
lies in these things:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="385" facs="tcp:100520:210"/>
1. That where Ecclesiastical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
do inforce any part of the
Law of God, although it be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
contained therein, they do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
bind the Consciences of
Men.</p>
            <p>2. That where they tend to the
good of the Church, and the Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Decency and Order, they
do so far oblige, that the contempt
of Authority therein, is a Sin against
the Law of God.</p>
            <p>3. That where the Injunctions of
Authority are for no other End, but
to be obeyed, he doth not think that
there is any strict Obligation in point
of Conscience.</p>
            <p>And so far <hi>Cajetan</hi> agrees with
him.<note place="margin">Cajet. Sum. 6. Contempt. &amp;c. Clerico<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> rum.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And although the other Casuists
seem to be very angry with him, yet
when they require a publick Good,
and the Order of the Church to be
the Reason of Ecclesiastical Laws,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:100520:211"/>
they do, in effect, agree with him.</p>
            <p>Now as to the Matter of our
Canons which respect the Clergy,
there are two especially which bind
them strictly;</p>
            <p>1. The Canon about Sobriety of
Conversation, <hi>Can.</hi> 75. Yes, some
may say, as far as the Law of God
obliges, <hi>i.e.</hi> to Temperance and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety;
but the Canon forbids re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorting
to <hi>Taverns, or Alebouses, or
playing at Dice, Cards, or Tables;</hi> doth
this Canon oblige in Conscience in
this manner? If it were a new thing
that were forbidden, there were some
Plea against the Severity of it; but
frequenting Publick Houses is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
by the Apostolical Canons,<note place="margin">Can. Apost. 54.</note>

            <p>II. The Canons which relate to
Ministers discharging the several Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of their Function, in Preaching,
Praying, Administring Sacraments,
Catechizing, Visiting the Sick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
which are intended to inforce an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent
Duty; which we can never
press you too much or too earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to; considering that the Honour
of Religion, and the Salvation of
your own and the Peoples Souls de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon it.</p>
            <p>(2.) The next way of judging
the Church's Intention, is by the
Words and Sense of the Church.<note place="margin">Caj. &amp; Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ept.</note>
               <hi>Cajetan</hi> thinks the general Sense is the
best Rule.<note place="margin">

               <hi>Navarr</hi> saith to the same
purpose, although some Words are
stricter than others.<note place="margin">Suarez de LL. <hi>l. 4. c.</hi> 18.</note> 
               <hi>Suarez,</hi> That
the main Obligation depends on the
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:100520:212"/>
matter, but the Church's Intention
may be more expressed by special
Words of Command.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tolet. Sum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> l. 8. c. 19. n. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Tolet</hi> relies
most upon the Sense of the Church:
But the Sense of the Church must be
understood, whether it be Approving,
or Recommending, or strictly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding,
according to the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Affirmative Precepts, which
makes a reasonable Allowance for
Circumstances. And so our Church
in some cases expresly allows reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Impediments. And in Precepts
of Abstinence, we must distinguish
the Sense of the Church, as to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Abstinence, <hi>i.e.</hi> subduing the
Flesh to the Spirit; and a Ritual Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence
in a meer Difference of Meats,
which our Church lays no Weight
upon; and a Religious Abstinence
for a greater Exercise of Prayer and
Devotion, which our Church doth
particularly recommend at particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Seasons, which I need not mention.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="390" facs="tcp:100520:213"/>
(3.) By the Penalties annexed,
which you may find by reading over
the Canons, which you ought to do
frequently and seriously, in order to
your own Satisfaction about your
Duties, and the Obligation to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But some may think,</hi> that such
Penal Canons oblige only to undergo the
Punishment.</p>
            <p>To which I answer, That the case
is very different in an <hi>Hypothetical
Law,</hi> as <hi>Suarez</hi> calls it; when Laws
are only conditional and disjunctive,
either you must do so, or you
must undergo such Penalty, which
is then looked on as a legal Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence;
and Ecclesiastical Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
where Obedience is chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
and the Penalty is annexed
only to inforce it, and to deterr others
from Disobedience. For no Man
can imagine that the Church aims
at any Man's Suspension or Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:100520:213"/>
for it self, or by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
for the Breach of its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions.</p>
            <p>And now give me leave not only
to put you in mind, but to press
earnestly upon you the diligent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of those Duties, which by
the Laws of God and Man, and by
your own voluntary Promises when
you undertook the Cure of Souls,
are incumbent upon you. It is too
easie to observe, That those who
have the Law on their side, and the
Advantage of a National Settlement,
are more apt to be remiss and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
when they have the Stream
with them, than those who row a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, and therefore must take
more pains to carry on their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs.
As those who force a Trade
must use much more Diligence, than
those who go on in the common
Road of Business. But what Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
others use in gaining Parties,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:100520:214"/>
do you imploy in the saving their
Souls: Which the People will never
believe you are in earnest in, unless
they observe you are very careful in
saving your own by a conscientious
Discharge of your Duties. They do
not pretend to Fineness of Thoughts,
and Subtilty of Reasoning, but they
are shrewd Judges whether Men
mean what they say, or not; and
they do not love to be imposed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by such a sort of Sophistry, as if
they could think that they can have
such a Regard to their Souls, who
shew so little to their own. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let your unblameable and holy
Conversations, your Charity and
good Works, your Diligence and
Constancy in your Duties, convince
them that you are in earnest; and
they will hearken more to you, than
if you used the finest Speeches, and
the most eloquent Harangues in the
Pulpit to them. These, the People
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:100520:214"/>
understand little, and value less;
but a serious, convincing, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
way of Preaching, is the
most likely way to work upon
them. If there be such a thing as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
World, as no doubt there is,
what can you imploy your Time,
and Thoughts, and Pains better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
than preparing the Souls of
your People for a happy Eternity?
How mean are all other laborious
Trifles, and learned Impertinencies,
and busie Inquiries, and restless
Thoughts, in comparison with this
most valuable and happy Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if we discharge it well? And
happy is that Man, who enjoys the
Satisfaction of doing his Duty now,
and much more happy will he be
<hi>whom our Lord, when he cometh, shall
find so doing.</hi>
