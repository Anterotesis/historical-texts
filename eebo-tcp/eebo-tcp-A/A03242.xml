         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

those of the noblest Citizens, who in that garbe wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
the streets with humble lookes, and submisse ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
thereby to insinuate themselves into the
grace of the people, being ambitious after honour and
Office. Great Lord, it fareth not so with You, who
though for inward Candor and sincerity, You may
compare with the best of them, yet have beene so far
from affecting such popularity, that though You in
Your great Modesty would willingly have evaded
it; yet some places by importunity, and this Your

               <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>ONDON and WESTMINSTER
are two Twin-sister-Cities; as
joyned by one Street, so wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by one streame: the first a
breeder of grave Magistrates,
the second, the buriall-place of
great Monarchs; Both famous
for their two Cathedrals: the one Dedicated to the
honour of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> the other of Saint <hi>Peter.</hi>
These I rather concatenate, because as in the one,
the Right Honourable the Lord Major receiveth
his honour, so in the other he takes his Oath: yet
<hi>London</hi> may be presum'd to be the elder, and more
excellent in Birth, Meanes, and Issue; in the first for
her Antiquity, in the second for her Ability, in the
<pb facs="tcp:4266:4"/>
third, for her numerous Progeny: she and her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs
being decored with two severall Burses or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes,
and beautified with two eminent Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
of Exercise, knowne by the names of <hi>Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery</hi>
and <hi>Military.</hi> I shall not need to insist much
either upon her Extension, or Dimension, nor to
compare her with other eminent Cities that were,
or are, it having beene an Argument treated of by
Authentick Authors, and the laborious project of
many learned Pennes, and frequently celebrated
upon the like dayes of Solemnity.</p>
            <p>And although by the space of Tenne yeares last
past, there hath not beene any Lord Major free
of that Company, yet was there within Twelve
yeeres before that sixe Lord Majors of the same.
And it shall not bee amisse to give you a briefe
Nomination of some Honourable Praetors, and
those of prime Remarke in that Company: Sir
<hi>Henry Fitz-Alwin</hi> Draper, was the first Lord Major
of this Citie, which place hee held for foure and
twenty yeeres together, and upward; and in the
first yeere of his Majoralty, <hi>Anno 1210. London</hi>-Bridge,
which was before made of Timber, was
begun to be built of Stone. Sir <hi>William Powltney</hi>
was foure times Lord Major; 1337 he built a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
in <hi>Pauls,</hi> where hee lyeth buried, and erected
a Colledge neere unto the Church of St. <hi>Laurence
Powltney, London:</hi> He moreover built the Church
of little <hi>Alhallows</hi> in <hi>Thames street,</hi> with other
pious and devout Acts. <hi>Iohn Hind</hi> Draper, Lord
<pb facs="tcp:4266:4"/>
Major 1405, built the Church of Sr. <hi>Swithen</hi> by
<hi>London-stone, &amp;c.</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Norman</hi> was the first that
rowed in his Bardge to <hi>Westminster,</hi> when hee went
to take his Oath: Sir <hi>Richard Hardell</hi> face in the
Judicatory Seate sixe yeares together: <hi>Simon Eyre</hi>
Lord Major, built <hi>Leaden-Hall</hi> at his owne proper
costs and charges: Sir <hi>Richard Pipe, George Monox,</hi>
Lord Major 1515, and Sir <hi>Iohn Milborne,</hi> were
great Erectors of Almes-houses, Hospitalls, &amp;c.
and left liberally to the poore: Sir <hi>Richard Campion</hi>
perfected divers charitable workes, left unfinish't by

something of the Sheepe, who is of all other foure-footed
beasts the most harmelesse and gentle. Those
that write of them, report, that in <hi>Arabia</hi> they have
tayles three Cubits in length: In <hi>Chios</hi> they are the
smallest, but their Milke and Cheese the sweetest,
and best. The Lambe from her yeaning knoweth
and acknowledgeth her Damme: Those are held to
be most profitable for store, whose bodies are big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest,
the fleece softest and thickest, and their legs
shortest. Their Age is reckoned at Tenne yeeres,

they breed at Two, and cease at Nine: The Ewes
goe with their young an Hundred and fifty dayes.
