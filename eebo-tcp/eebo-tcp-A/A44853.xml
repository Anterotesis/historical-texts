            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>MY Oppoſitions this day in this affair, may be thought ſtrange, yet not more ſtrange than the joyning Oppoſers; for one that comes here, I may acquieſce as to his Worthineſs; for thoſe that appear now, as the laſt time, it might be more ſeaſonable for them to tell the Country of a new Commonwealth in a diſguiſe, than to put a ſecond Fob upon them. I here declare in the face of the County, I come here to the aſſiſtance of our King and Country, and to uphold the moſt glorious Church in the World, ſetled in this Iſle; and withal to ſpeak my Minde, which I include, and ſhall ſeal with my Life and Fortune, in defence of his Majeſty and our Church, as it is now eſtabliſhed, againſt all Oppoſers. Knowing the old Fallacy, to profeſs one thing, and act another, as in the late Uſurpation; to ſet Coblers in the places of Kings, and Tinkers as Princes. Now you have my free ſence of what I pray God prevent; take right meaſures, and recollect if in thoſe ſad Times there was not more inſulting from the Shopboard, which moſt of thoſe that bore Power came from, than now there is from the Noblemans Chair. Before a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth come here, I will looſe my Life and Fortune, chooſing rather to extinguiſh with the Crown, which God forbid, than ſurvive to ſee Nothing, as heretofore, come in ſo high place; which this Kingdom can never ſuffer, ſo long as <hi>Engliſh</hi> Spirits are in being, which the worſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of cannot ſubmit to, without a true Head, which now we have, and I hope of the Line ſhall never want. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the reſt, that God would bleſs the King, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the preſent Settlement of our Religion now eſtabliſhed, which with my Blood I will ſeal. You have your Choice, I my Satisfaction in diſcharging my ſelf in this matter, not being given to Change.</p>
