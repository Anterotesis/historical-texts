            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </hi> Have (reposing in your Lordships in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous nature) assumed the audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for two respects, to present these my Neophiticall labours vnto your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. The first reason moving me so to doe, is this: Each generous minde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes your Lordship to be well affected towards every act or aime (being vertuous) of whatsoever qualitie. The which report hath much imboldned mee (though meanly acquainted) to offer out of the indigencie of my illiterate skull, this litle mite, assuredly expecting (that since it proceeds of a loving &amp; liberal mind, that your L. will accept thereof (though it be not of such value) even as well as of theirs (who out of the abundant riches of their prudent and learned experiences) doe vsually throw moe talents into the The saurie of your Lordships praeexcellent and admired worth. The second reason in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing me, is this, That in regard this my Poeticall Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordium, is the first perspicuous invention of my stirile braine: and therefore consequently fearing the insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie
<pb facs="tcp:9785:3"/>
thereof, I esteemed it my best to make choyce of your Lordship, as my worthy <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> whose gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and great respect, is of sufficient power to palliate all the infirmities of this Pamphlet, yea and to shrowd the very same from the impetuous obloquie, and prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous scandall, of the most calumnious carper, or Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke Inveigher. Therefore since for your Lordship I did it, and to your Lordship I direct it: then good my Lord vouchsafe to patronize it. By which means I shall prove fortunate in my attempt, &amp; your Lordship (as you are of every worthy one already, much respected) shal al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of me be more &amp; more reverenced, &amp; intirely &amp; infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly affected, as I have special reason, being tyed many wayes thereto by dutie-bound obligation: of the which I esteem this last none of the least, and shall perpetually acknowledge it so to be, wishing your Lordship (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall of the same vndeserved benefite) the perfect frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of each terrestriall happinesse here, and immortall felicitie hence, vowing likewise solemnly (during life) to continue,</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Vdicious and Courteous Reader, knowing (by many experiences) that those who are most pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, learned, or capable, are generally ever most favourable and sparing in their censures. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have presumed to commit this Poeme to thy view, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating thee, that though perhaps it doe not give thee every way content, and that in respect it is voyd of ornate or elegant phrase, and not of an Heroicke stile: and therfore not answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to thy expectation, nor my desire: yet since it is (though not as I would, yet such as I could) allow me this gaines for my paines, that it passe without checke. But after the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vsing hereof, if thou bee so benevolently disposed, (though not to commend the worke) yet to approve my aime, I shall for that vndeserved favour, ever esteeme my selfe infinitely bound to thy courtesie. But if thou prove towards mee an invective Critick, I am enforced to tel thee, that <hi>Momists</hi> are little or nothing respected. And <hi>Zoylus,</hi> though through car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at <hi>Homerus</hi> his workes, acquired the name of <hi>Homero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mastix</hi> (which is <hi>Homers</hi> scourge) yet was he laught at for his paines, because he disapproved the worke which hee could neither amend nor paralell. It likewise was reputed a cynical humour in <hi>Phocion</hi> (though hee was <hi>Plato</hi> his scholler) to carp at every man that wore shooes, because he himself went alwayes bare-footed. Likewise let me advise thee, if thou be a Poet, that thou doe not, with <hi>Theon,</hi> satyrickly inveigh at those who are thy betters, because thou thy selfe comest short of their worke, and therefore canst neither merite nor attaine the like commendation. Grudge not therefore because that the Poetical talent is not bestowed vpon every one alike, but rather endevour through study (if thou be so vertuously incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) to extend the Talent thou hast allowed thee. But if thou be illiterate, and yet aime to censure (if thou hadst vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding) this Poeme invectively, I will advise thee for
<pb facs="tcp:9785:4"/>
thy profite (though I have small reason so to doe, in respect of thy malevolentinent) to desist, lest thou give me occasion to say, <hi>Ne Sutor vltra crepidam:</hi> or, smiling at thy peevish humour, intreat thee to meddle onely with such things as come within the compasse of thy capacitie. Yea, though thou be indifferently well affected, yet if ihou be vnlearned, I dare hardly adventure to come within the circuite of thy censure, lest either through misconstruing the subiect, or maimedly reading the verse, thou value my labour at too low a rate. But vnhappy hee (and worthy to bee esteemed the Prince of fooles) who willingly consents to vnder-goe the censure of those who are both besotted with ignorance, and of a Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick disposition. Yet expecting the best of every Reader, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I by those, no otherwayes have deserved, I thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, which every one that is capable must allow, as a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma,</hi> that since love ever aimes at a correspondencie, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding of the inequalitie of persons. For as the old Scottish Adage goeth, <hi>Love cannot stand on the one side.</hi> So Reader, I whatsoever thou be) according to thy censure of these my labours, rest towards thee affected, even thus,</p>

               <l>Sweet lovely faire, please you remember right,</l>
               <l>When I of you my transport did obtaine,</l>
               <l>I told you that my stay would marre my spright,</l>

               <l>For such like matter I ne're thought vpon,</l>
               <l>As of transport, but glad was to conceale</l>
               <l>My love, vntill such time as there was none</l>
               <l>Hard by, to heare what I to you reveale:</l>
               <l>For since, sweete loue, I saw you in the wood,</l>
               <l>I still esteem'd you my sole earthly good.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Even then when you did richly benefite</l>
               <l>The colding spring, with touch of your faire hide,</l>
               <l>The fountaine bathe within, for to repeate</l>
               <l>What ioy the whole spectators were beside</l>
               <l>Did then conceive, would scarcely purchase trust,</l>

               <l>That I, by such great beauties much amaz'd,</l>
               <l>Into a bush, hard by, my selfe abscond,</l>

                  <l>She caused skild Artificers, erect (to her great charge)</l>
                  <l>Of marble black, &amp; Alabast, a fountaine high &amp; large.</l>
                  <l>Like to a stately <hi>Pyramis,</hi> the healthfull spring above,</l>
                  <l>Lest any of ingratitude, her iustly might reprove.</l>
                  <l>In memorie of benefite she once did there receive,</l>
                  <l>Expert Mechanicks shee causd search, could rightly cut and grave.</l>
                  <l>Through dext'rous cunning these adorn'd the happy healthful fount,</l>
                  <l>With Emblemes fram'd of Alabast, and marble of the mount.</l>
                  <l>Of yeares, two lusters scarce were spent, after this work was done,</l>
                  <l>When she citations had from death, so had her brothers sonne.</l>
                  <l>The Dutchesse did the gods implore, that they the youth would spare</l>
                  <l>And pittie him of tender yeares, and expectation rare.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Thessalia's</hi> hope, his mothers ioy, sole comfort of his Syre,</l>
                  <l>For doubtlesly if now he dy'd, their lives would then expyre.</l>
                  <l>As for her selfe she was resolv'd, Deaths message to obey,</l>
                  <l>And that ne' re-yet remitted debt, she's willing to repay.</l>
                  <l>It seem'd the gods did grant her suite, the boy did convalesse,</l>
                  <l>But she (sweet Lady) found deaths force, her vitall spirites distresse.</l>
                  <l>Then cald she for her love, &amp; Lord, whose groanes proclaim'd his grieves</l>
                  <l>And for her lasse <hi>Lucilla</hi> fair, in whom true beauty lives.</l>
                  <l>Deare Lord &amp; loue (quoth she) I finde that we must parted bee,</l>
                  <l>The loyall love I to thee beare, doth make me loath to dye.</l>

                  <l>And <hi>Atropos</hi> now cuts the threed which <hi>Lachesis</hi> once spun.</l>
                  <l>So hence I must (√¥ deare sweete love) I pray thee doe not weepe,</l>
                  <l>For sure my sp'rite midst highest heavens, the sacred gods will keepe.</l>

                     <hi>Lucilla</hi> deare, thy mothers ioy, come to thy dying Dame,</l>
                  <l>As Heavens &amp; Nature thee inricht with beauties bravest frame,</l>
                  <l>Heavens grant that thou doe vse it well, to thy immortall praise,</l>
                  <l>Live chastly, yet selfe-loue abhorre, pride breeds contempt alwayes.</l>
                  <l>This one thing doe I thee intreate, in memorie of me,</l>
                  <l>Goe thrice a yeare &amp; view the spring thy mother did supplie.</l>

When physicke, nor no simples could, the venome strong expell,</l>
                  <l>The water of the healthfull spring, in power did precell.</l>
                  <l>Therefore three times a yeare doe view, that spring by consuetude,</l>
                  <l>And mother-like (what beasts detests) abhorre ingratitude.</l>
                  <l>Thus said, her happy sp'rite she yeelds, which to eternall ioy</l>
                  <l>Numberles numbers powers divine, invisibly convoy.</l>
                  <l>Her funerals once solemntz'd, then doth <hi>Lucilla</hi> faire,</l>
                  <l>In sable robes of mourning black, with maids so clad, prepare</l>
                  <l>To goe and view the healthfull spring, and there bewaile her losse,</l>
                  <l>And mothers death, whose memories, giues her continuall crosse.</l>
                  <l>Since she is thus determined, her father likewise send</l>

                  <l>Those likewise serve as mariners, to rule her bark by sea,</l>
                  <l>Accompanied by those, and mayds, she doth continually</l>
                  <l>Thrice yearly goe and view that spring, a day or two they mourne,</l>
                  <l>Their regrates being finished, againe they here returne.</l>
                  <l>Her father, though he haue no sonne, for to succeed his place,</l>
                  <l>Loves her so well, hee will not wed againe in any case.</l>
                  <l>Yet though he loue her, he ore-lookes her with a prying eye,</l>
                  <l>Loue hatcheth care, which care begets respectiue Iealousie.</l>
                  <l>The iealous Syre of daughters good, doth make her liue retyrd,</l>
                  <l>For which himselfe of strangers is, ridic'lously admyrd.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Lucilla,</hi> since her mother dy'd, is forc't to liue apart</l>
                  <l>From company of anyman, which sure must grieve her heart.</l>
                  <l>For saue those Eunuchs, &amp; those maids, who serue her night &amp; day,</l>
                  <l>And her own Syre, the aged Duke, none else approach her may.</l>
                  <l>Many a Prince, and gallant Knight, doe her in mariage crave,</l>
                  <l>But through her fathers perswasiues, she none at all will haue.</l>
                  <l>And for to try to speake herselfe, it's folly, there's no meane</l>
                  <l>She is so warelie lookt vnto, none can such good attaine.</l>
                  <l>This aged Duke, and his faire Lasse, dwell neere within sixe mile,</l>
                  <l>Where they in divers sports delight, to posting time beguile.</l>
                  <l>A castle situate by a lake, in it doe they abide,</l>
                  <l>From thence they see both woods &amp; meads, &amp; ships at anchor ride.</l>
                  <l>Even from this Castle of the Dukes, about a fourthnight since,</l>
                  <l>In companie of other knights, went the <hi>Thessalian</hi> Prince,</l>
                  <l>Retimes they rise, and winde their hotnes, not fearing any foe,</l>
                  <l>Through desart woods, &amp; vnknowne paths, they all a hunting goe.</l>
                  <l>But whilst the rest their horses mount, the Prince his horse refuses,</l>
                  <l>Him to receive, yet would the youth, admit no such excuses.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:9785:19"/>
Twice more then thrice the horse would not, permit the Prince him back,</l>
                  <l>Prodigious presage which foreshews the riders speedy wrack.</l>
                  <l>Hard by the lake there haunts a Beare, a monster for a beast,</l>
                  <l>Who by the space of thirtie yeares, those woods did haunt at least.</l>
                  <l>This beast mongst brakes &amp; pricklie thornes, all day still lurking lay,</l>
                  <l>And when dark night black mantle spred, then went to seek his pray.</l>
                  <l>The night preceeding he had straid, abroad to seek his food,</l>
                  <l>His late trac't steps (though not by sent) might well bee knowne by blood.</l>
                  <l>There did the hounds, by fatall chance, finde out the recent sent.</l>
                  <l>With librall mouths against the clouds, their voice they largely spent</l>
                  <l>This quick approach soon rousde the Beare from out his lothed hold,</l>
                  <l>The hounds give chalenge, he againe, gives them encounter bold.</l>
                  <l>Now huntsmen came, where at the hounds with courage fresh begin</l>
                  <l>A new pursute, yet none so bold, as once to tooth his skin.</l>
                  <l>The knights with darts the Beare so wound, that void of all remorse</l>
                  <l>This desp'rate beast (afflicted thus) the yong Prince did vnhorse.</l>
                  <l>Their darts are spent, no shot they have, so all their helpe is vaine,</l>
                  <l>Maugre them all, before their eyes, <hi>Thessalia's</hi> Prince is slaine.</l>
                  <l>A steepie rock conteines a cave, the Beare long vsd before,</l>
                  <l>Thither went he (with dogges convoy) of him they saw no more.</l>
                  <l>Huntsmen with sad and sorie hearts, their cloathes they all to rent,</l>
                  <l>Home with the corps they sadly move, this hunting they repent.</l>
                  <l>But when the Duke this obiect saw (a wofull one indeed)</l>
                  <l>He and <hi>Lucilla</hi> all the rest, in sorrow did exceed,</l>
                  <l>Helplesse is their excessive griefe, though nat'rall bee their mone,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Nature</hi> to life can nere restore, whom death hath once vndone.</l>
                  <l>But yet the Duke makes narrow search to guerdon the offender,</l>
                  <l>And still the Beare for this his paines, bad thanks again doth render.</l>
                  <l>For whom the beast conveens withall, may hee prevaile with rage,</l>
                  <l>Them makes he smart, without respect, of person, sexe, or age.</l>
                  <l>So this abuse hath causd the Duke, stil hoping for amends,</l>
                  <l>Him to assist to kill the Beare, intreat his neighbouring friends.</l>
                  <l>And as I shew you we expect them next ensuing weeke.</l>
                  <l>So this is all concerning this, I know, or yet can speake.</l>
                  <l>Yet this I'me sure, some gallants will fearlesly try their strength,</l>
                  <l>And for their loues couragiously abbreviate the length</l>
                  <l>Of their strong launce, into the Beare, if they may him conveene,</l>
                  <l>Not caring for his crush, or bite, his choler, rage, or spleene.</l>
                  <l>But now me thinks I heare a horne, therefore must I bee gone,</l>
                  <l>So, pray you sir, apardon me, for leaving you alone.</l>

Farewell my friend, quoth <hi>Calanthrop,</hi> good successe still enioy,</l>

               <l>And tells his master that he had prepar'd</l>
               <l>An Inne: but (quoth he) I good fortune had,</l>
               <l>Else mongst those woods I doubtlesse had been snar'd,</l>
               <l>A wench I found, which did direct mee right,</l>

               <l>The merriest man that ever I did see,</l>
               <l>Is that your Hoast, Sir if you so be pleasd.</l>
               <l>Wel grounded walls, high, large, &amp; passing strong</l>
               <l>The Citie guard from iniurie or wrong,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Many braue Knights perambulate the streete,</l>
               <l>Who come to hunt, as Citizens report,</l>
               <l>Some rav'nous beast, who badly doth intreat</l>
               <l>The countrey people: so that to be short,</l>
               <l>Each man provides him horse, and hounds, and lance,</l>
               <l>Against the hunts, his honour to advance.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>By this discourse now <hi>Calanthrop</hi> did finde</l>

               <l>Still doth the Page, according to his minde,</l>
               <l>Solve all demands his master him proposd.</l>
               <l>Now came they to the Cities Easterne wall,</l>
               <l>Found patent gates, such fortune did befall.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then went they to their Inne the ready way,</l>
               <l>They supt, and then betooke them to their rest,</l>
               <l>Next morning early, by the breake of day,</l>

               <l>The Page did shortly his desire fulfill,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>When day appear'd, each man to palace sought,</l>
               <l>The Duke t'attend, yet <hi>Calanthrop</hi> abode</l>
               <l>Still with his hoast, till all were gone, then thought</l>
               <l>He best to goe: so to the wood he rode,</l>
               <l>His courteous hoast did him such favour yeild,</l>
               <l>As to conduct him to the hunting field.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But e're they came, the game was well begun</l>
               <l>So they retyr'd, expecting the event,</l>
               <l>Vnto a shade, bright <hi>Phoebus</hi> beames to shun,</l>
               <l>Now doth the Beare boldly himselfe present,</l>
               <l>He (fearlesse beast) 'ginnes such encounter give,</l>
               <l>His tuskes and pawes both hounds and huntsmen grieve.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>At this the Knights seeme all to be asham'd,</l>
               <l>To kill the Beare they all at once conspire,</l>
               <l>But this designe is worthy to be blam'd,</l>
               <l>He who intends true honour to acquyre,</l>
               <l>His foe with equall number should assaile,</l>
               <l>Then merits praise, if he doe so prevaile.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Yet notwithstanding of their multitude,</l>
               <l>The Beare perswades them to a sham'd retreite,</l>
               <l>Many brave Knight he of their armes denude,</l>
               <l>Which sight did val'rous <hi>Calanthrop</hi> incite,</l>
               <l>For seeing how each Knight did court'sie straine</l>
               <l>Who first should try himselfe, the Beare againe.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Heroick hee, impatient of delay,</l>
               <l>On his black Courser, from the thicket rushes,</l>
               <l>The beast inrag'd, him meetes in middle way,</l>
               <l>In his thick hide the lance in peeces frushes,</l>
               <l>Yet for all that, meane while the Knight dismounts,</l>
               <l>The Beare a trick him taught next time he hunts.</l>

               <l>But now the gallant quickly him affoord</l>
               <l>Due recompence for his intended harme,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The beast perceives his aime, in this hard case,</l>
               <l>By shift of body doth the thrust avoyd,</l>
               <l>And for this kindnesse offers him t'imbrace,</l>
               <l>The Knight could not such demonstrations bide:</l>
               <l>But sensibly he made the Beare to know</l>
               <l>Come was the time, he must his life forgoe.</l>

               <l>The Beares left legge, largely two yards and more</l>
               <l>Full from the other: Intrals through his sides</l>

               <l>The beast lies kild by <hi>Calanthrops</hi> brave hand,</l>

               <l>The Duke and Knights admire this noble deed,</l>
               <l>Though none of them thereof may iustly boast,</l>
               <l>Therefore the Duke sends to request the Knight</l>

               <l>Himselfe before the message came, absented,</l>
               <l>Such loue-sick thoughts his minde so ever crost,</l>

               <l>By this dayes sport: but yet the great disgrace</l>
               <l>His Knights had got: iustly no pardon crav'd,</l>
               <l>Sham'd to confesse, yet reason them constraind</l>
               <l>An vnknowne Knight, not they, the honour gain'd.</l>

               <l>Most glad in heart, the Duke hastes to his home,</l>
               <l>With many Knights, discoursing on this sport,</l>
               <l>They all yeeld praise to one, they know not whom,</l>
               <l>The Beare his death did each of them comfort,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>For the good Duke to glad his guests withall,</l>
               <l>When he came home, causd his faire lasse be brought</l>
               <l>To sup with them: to minde he then doth call,</l>
               <l>The val'rous act one knight that day had wrought,</l>
               <l>Then to <hi>Lucilla</hi> told in pleasant words,</l>
               <l>In audience of Knights, Princes, Earles and Lords.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>How that an vnknowne Knight the Beare did kill,</l>
               <l>For after (quoth he) we had rouz'd the beast,</l>
               <l>The tim'rous hounds at bay did keepe him still,</l>
               <l>Many were hurt, glad to retire, at least</l>
               <l>They seem'd vnwilling any more to try,</l>
               <l>Wherein the Beares defence and strength did lye.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But while as yet each knight with other strove,</l>
               <l>Who first should dare him to encounter new,</l>
               <l>There came a knight from an adiacent grove,</l>
               <l>His horse, lance, clothes, were of a pale-black hew,</l>
               <l>The Beare in mid-way meets him on the plaines,</l>
               <l>As loath to put a stranger to great paines.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>With an vnformall welcome doth him greet,</l>
               <l>Yet on his breast the lance doth split asunder,</l>
               <l>But e're the knight on ground could fixe his feet,</l>
               <l>The Beare got vp, though he was once at vnder,</l>
               <l>Then e're the knight could halfe his sword vnsheath,</l>
               <l>He runnes to him belike, to begge his death.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Which suit the knight seem'd willing to obey,</l>
               <l>For at one stroke he did the Beare so wound,</l>
               <l>The griefe thereof his body did o're-sway,</l>
               <l>Foure-feet thereafter set he ne're on ground,</l>
               <l>One of his legges the knight quite off did cut,</l>
               <l>Then in the sheath his noble sword he put.</l>

               <pb facs="tcp:9785:22"/>
               <l>Then on his horse he quickly did returne</l>
               <l>To that same grove, from which of late he came,</l>
               <l>Thither where we thought he did then soiourne,</l>
               <l>I sent three Lords for to enquire his name,</l>

               <l>Then since they could not finde him any where,</l>

               <l>Acted, by that brave magnanimick youth,</l>

               <l>Sir (quoth <hi>Lucilla)</hi> give me leave to speake,</l>

               <l>When <hi>Hercules</hi> to fetch his wife did goe,</l>
               <l>Infernal <hi>Phasma's</hi> made his courage droupe,</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Oeta's</hi> foes did bravely him assist,</l>

               <l>Himselfe a Coward, if hee misse the stroke,</l>

               <l>No greed of gaine, nor yet necessitie</l>
               <l>Did move this gallant enterprise this deed,</l>
               <l>True honour did his minde most qualifie,</l>

               <l>Deare father therefore whatsoe're he be,</l>
               <l>Of yong and old he ever should be lov'd,</l>
               <l>Of rich and poore, of each sexe and degree,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Though all the min'rals earth containes, were swords,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For <hi>Philotomp,</hi> that proud ostentive man,</l>
               <l>Made search to know where the knight did remaine,</l>
               <l>Fully resolv'd to kill him if hee can,</l>
               <l>Naughtie designes are bred in basest braine,</l>

            </lg>

               <l>And so perhaps, might find time to insist</l>

               <l>Renue his suite, and make his love more knowne,</l>

               <l>Most sure Loves seed is recompence in love,</l>

               <l>Lustfull desires are ever worthy blame.</l>

               <l>The Duke well kmowing that this was the knight,</l>

               <l>Loves lawlesse passions doe the knight much grieve,</l>
               <l>Though he for to restraine the same assay,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Therefore he sends for his faire Lasse in haste,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Beleeve me Sir (quoth <hi>Calanthrop)</hi> I came</l>

               <l>Of Ladies, whereof I beleeve this Dame</l>
               <l>Was chiefest: I desir'd their help to gaine</l>
               <l>The other shore, a stranger since I was,</l>
               <l>They me permitted in their Barke to passe.</l>
            </lg>

               <l>Sometimes I viewd the countrey vp and downe,</l>

               <l>Since so it is, in time it's best restraine</l>

            <lg>
               <l>The second dreame is called naturall,</l>

               <l>As phlegmatikes in sleep will dreame they fall</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The dreame of <hi>Revelation</hi> is the last,</l>
               <l>Which still foreshewes a good or bad successe,</l>
               <l>This taught men divination in times past,</l>
               <l>Thus knowne, of ioy or griefe it leaves excesse</l>

               <l>He brought a ship, then willd he her dilate</l>
               <l>What time his master fittest might resort</l>
               <l>To take them hence, and lib'rate them of thrall,</l>
               <l>Stay then (quoth she) and quickly that I shall.</l>

               <l>She swiftly went, return'd againe and told</l>
               <l>Him, that the time was best the second night,</l>
               <l>And willd him to his master such vnfold,</l>
               <l>That <hi>Luna's</hi> change would then prevent her light,</l>
               <l>Therefore it's best when that the night is darke,</l>

               <l>Of his sweet love <hi>Lucilla,</hi> beauteous Dame,</l>
               <l>Accomp'nied onely by <hi>Sophona</hi> true,</l>
               <l>Iesting (quoth he) faire Ladies you're too blame,</l>

               <l>For robbrie sure, and for no other thing,</l>
               <l>Indeed I should have been more circumspect,</l>
               <l>For why you little trunke my maid doth bring,</l>
               <l>If rightly searcht, more worth it will be found</l>

               <l>No, stay my friend, what mind you? how now? how?</l>
               <l>Is't so indeed? you'l force me then to call</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus merrily they talkt, to horse they went,</l>
               <l>Then to their ship the ready way they tooke,</l>
               <l>Ere they attain'd the shore the night was spent,</l>
               <l>The Page by chance did or'e his shoulder looke,</l>
               <l>And there he saw a sight he did not please,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>The Dukes whole guard and knights came ov'r a plaine,</l>

               <l>But ere they came, <hi>Calanthrop</hi> though with pain.</l>
               <l>Imbarkt the Ladies, yet was forc't to stay</l>
               <l>Himselfe on land his Lady to defend,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>One railing knight cryes, Yeeld, you villaine, you,</l>
               <l>And render those faire Ladies you have stolne,</l>
               <l>Else by the sacred gods above I vow,</l>
               <l>I shall cut off thy head: with rage so swolne</l>

                  <hi>Calanthrop</hi> was, he could not speak a word,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The knight confronts him, reaching him a blow,</l>
               <l>Then to his guard returnes for his defence,</l>
               <l>The wound was not so great as was the show,</l>
               <l>Yet <hi>Calanthrop</hi> did yeeld him recompence,</l>
               <l>Telling him first that he must now forgoe</l>

               <l>Hon'ring the nuptials with a great respect.</l>
               <l>The Duke tells them, his presence hee should give,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>So to their King <hi>Calanthrop</hi> they returne,</l>
               <l>Told him their answer, whereof hee was glad,</l>
               <l>Now in <hi>Vallonia</hi> did the King soiourne,</l>
               <l>Where'gainst his Nuptials hee provided had</l>
               <l>Each in his court, horse, clothes, and armour brave,</l>
               <l>And each thing requisite their hearts could crave.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Amongst those Courtiers was one gallant knight,</l>

               <l>This knight did love <hi>Sophona</hi> that sweete Lasse,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Sophona</hi> likewise did the knight affect,</l>
               <l>For why, no wench his carriage could reiect.</l>

               <l>In birth his equall, and such like in love,</l>

               <l>Applaud this match, and willingly approve</l>
               <l>Their equall choyce, so king and Queene consent</l>

               <l>Imag'narie that mortall creatures have.</l>
               <l>Thus they, swift sliding time in pleasure spend,</l>

               <l>Now when this day that every one desir'd</l>

               <l>Were present, each one whom the King requir'd,</l>
               <l>Vnto them all <hi>Calanthrop</hi> spake these words,</l>

               <l>MY Princely brethren (quoth hee) I intreate</l>
               <l>You think not hardly I in Armes am clad,</l>
               <l>Nor that my Queen stands maskt: for I'le repeate</l>
               <l>The reason hereof, which yet makes her sad,</l>
               <l>Till she bee wedded, sheel'e not show her face,</l>
               <l>Nor I vnarme my selfe in any case.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This is the cause: Of late in <hi>Africa</hi>
               </l>
               <l>By chance I was (O fort'nate adventure)</l>
               <l>When as the King of <hi>Cyrenaica</hi>
               </l>
               <l>A tyrant vile, did many one iniure,</l>
               <l>Heavens struck this tyrant with a lethargie,</l>
               <l>So that no physick could his griefe supplie,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This Lady you see here, was then his Queene,</l>
               <l>Yet wedded to him much against her will,</l>
               <l>Hee wasfound dead vpon the wedding ev'n,</l>
               <l>So each one thought the Queen the king did kill.</l>
               <l>Therfore the Queen and this her waiting maid</l>
               <l>Who likewise must be maskt, as I have sayd,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Vntill she wedded be, imprisond were,</l>
               <l>Thereafter were they both adiudg'd to die</l>
               <l>Before the counsell would their king interre,</l>
               <l>This time a boy acquaints me privilie,</l>
               <l>That two the fairest Ladies that did breath,</l>
               <l>For no offence this day must suffer death.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I hearing that, having an Armie strong</l>
               <l>Hard by <hi>Corena,</hi> for a speciall vse,</l>
               <l>'Cause that dead king before had done me wrong</l>
               <l>I long'd for to revenge that old abuse.</l>
               <l>So I, in spite of his, releiv'd at length,</l>
               <l>Those Ladies two, by stratagems &amp; strength.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thereafter homeward I my iourney tooke,</l>
               <l>Those Ladies needes would beare me companie,</l>
               <l>Since for my sake they <hi>Africa</hi> forsook,</l>
               <l>It had in me been great discourtesie,</l>
               <l>Their kindnesse to reiect in any sort,</l>
               <l>Wherein I tooke thereafter great comfort.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Now you the reason may perhaps admire,</l>
               <l>Why she is pleasd be wedded vnder vaile,</l>
               <l>It is their countrey fashion (though not here)</l>
               <l>Those that be widowes, ever to bewaile</l>
               <l>Their husbands death, with maids in like attire</l>

               <l>Them vsually, for to leave off to mourne,</l>

               <l>The which they doe, and so againe returne</l>
               <l>To love the quick, and to forget the dead,</l>
               <l>This is the cause why those their face obscure,</l>
               <l>My Princely brethren hereof be you sure.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But now you may in reason likewise aske,</l>
               <l>Why I thus arm'd desire to wed my Bride,</l>
               <l>I else have showne you why the Ladies maske</l>
               <l>Their face: so likewise know, I arm'd abide,</l>

               <l>Who wan theirwives by Armes, were wedded thus.</l>

               <l>To abrogate such worthy fashions old,</l>

               <l>To see my off-spring in my place succed,</l>
               <l>Whilst I yet live: therefore to this intent,</l>
               <l>I set <hi>Calabria's</hi> crowne vpon thy head,</l>
               <l>And with my crowne receive my blessing here</l>
               <l>Before thy father and thy mother deare.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>The Prince thus crown'd, the dying Duke commends</l>
               <l>His people vnto <hi>Calanthrop</hi> the King,</l>
               <l>Then for his whole Nobilitie he sends</l>
               <l>Delivering them to him: but now the sting</l>
               <l>Of death, even then did penetrate his heart,</l>
               <l>Which forc't him say, Farewell, and so depart.</l>

               <l>Now since the Duke was dead, <hi>Calanthrop</hi> stayd</l>
               <l>Onely to see the funerall welldone,</l>
               <l>Which being ended, he no time delayd</l>
               <l>But to <hi>Epirus</hi> with his comp'nies gone,</l>
               <l>Yetdoth his wofull Queene with teares lament</l>
               <l>Her fathers death, which many moe repent.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus was the Crowne of <hi>Calabrie</hi> annext</l>
               <l>Vnto <hi>Epire,</hi> which many yeares indur'd,</l>
               <l>Till long time after they <hi>Epirots</hi> vext</l>
               <l>Through their revolt, and many times iniur'd</l>
               <l>Their Messengers, when they their tribute sought,</l>
               <l>Which twixt the kingdomes great warres after wrought.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For, since they saw <hi>Calabrians</hi> refusd</l>
               <l>To pay their tribute as they ought to doe</l>
               <l>Vnto the <hi>Epirots,</hi> and still abusd</l>
               <l>Each messenger that came <hi>Epirus</hi> froe,</l>
               <l>They then resolv'd to make them know by force</l>
               <l>Their dutie, and thereafter vse them worse.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To this effect the <hi>Epirots</hi> did raise</l>
               <l>An Armie great <hi>Calabria</hi> to invade,</l>
               <l>Each Prince in <hi>Greece</hi> to their immortall praise,</l>
               <l>Did them assist, and likewise did perswade</l>
               <l>Them for to prosecute what they resolv'd,</l>
               <l>Lest they, through stay, themselves in shame involv'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Therefore they went with all their Armie great,</l>
               <l>And so rebellious <hi>Calabrie</hi> assaild,</l>
               <l>Which frighted folke, with death their Armie threat,</l>
               <l>In end, those <hi>Grecian</hi> forces so prevaild,</l>
               <l>That they a Province wonne, and brookt in peace</l>
               <l>Long after that, which yet is cald <hi>Great Greece.</hi>

               <l>I will acquaint you with <hi>Calanthrops</hi> death,</l>
