            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>OR truth of this Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
enſuing, beſides cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of place, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
time, occaſion, ſo exactly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved;
I referre my ſelfe to the
Relation of thoſe Godly men, who
in ſeverall languages have mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
to the world the ſeverall paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
thereof: and although I am
not ignorant, that at the firſt they
were not only not credited, but alſo
diſcredited and ſlandered, by ſuch
as found them to bee a Blur to the
Romane Profeſsion, yet they lost not
their luſtre thereby, but being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
by many Compurgators of
ſeverall Nations, and ſome of the
Romiſh Religion, being all of them
ſpectators of this Tragedie. It oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
<pb facs="tcp:19592:3"/>
not only a further mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation
and confirmation of the
truth, but alſo a large &amp; more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
confluence, to ſee that which
they had formerly only heard of.
This partly appeareth out of the
ſucceeding Story; but more fully
out of an Apology written by <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerius</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Iuſtinople,</hi> who
was accuſed for diſperſing the fame
of this Example to the ſtaine of
Popery, in which Apology to <hi>N.
Rottan,</hi> Suffragen of <hi>Padua,</hi> is
ſhortly and plainly declared, what
was ſaid, what was done, and who
were preſent. If that it be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
what mooved mee to compile
this Treatiſe; <hi>Spira</hi>—tell them that
it ſhould teach feare and reverence,
and indeed among all thoſe that
come to ſee him, few or none re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes
unſhaken. <hi>Vergerius</hi> in his
firſt Epistle ſaith; I would faine
goe ſee him again, but I exceedingly
<pb facs="tcp:19592:3"/>
feare and tremble, and in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie
ſaith, it is ſuch a rare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
as I would willingly goe to
the furthest parts of the world to
heare or ſee the like. The Lady
<hi>Iane</hi> to her Fathers Chaplaine
(that had falne into <hi>Spira's</hi> ſinne)
ſaith, remember the lamentable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
of <hi>Spira.</hi> I acknowledge that
there hath beene formerly a Booke
publiſhed in our Mother tongue,
concerning this ſubject, but as farre
as I can learne (for I could never
yet obtaine to ſee any one of them)
it was nothing ſo large and various
as this preſent Treatiſe, and as I
have heard, a tranſlation of onely
one of the Tractates, from whence I
have gathered this preſent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
in part. Concerning my care
and fidelitie in this buſineſſe, it is
ſuch as I may truely ſay without
changing of colour, that there is not
one ſentence of all this Worke attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
<pb facs="tcp:19592:4"/>
unto the perſon of <hi>Spira,</hi> but
it hath it warrant, either from the
Epiſtles of <hi>Vergerius</hi> and <hi>Gribal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
Profeſſours of the Law in
<hi>Padua,</hi> or from the Diſcourſes of

and <hi>Martin Bocha</hi> a Divine

other Libertie then as a Relation to

Sunne of the

in <hi>Europe;</hi> in the daies
of the raigne of <hi>Edward</hi>
the Sixth of that name
King of <hi>England:</hi> In the

of <hi>Venice,</hi> being the very
border of <hi>Italy,</hi> in the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19592:5"/>
towne of <hi>Cittadella,</hi> lived
one <hi>Francis Spira,</hi> a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
Lawyer, an Advocate
of great rank and eſteeme,
being of knowne learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
&amp; eloquence? of great
experience; of carriage
circumſpect and ſevere;
his ſpeech grave &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
his countenance
ſharpe and auſtere; every
way befitting that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
whereunto hee was
advanced; endowed vvith
outward bleſsings, of
wife, &amp; eleven children,
&amp; wealth in abundance:
what his worſt parts
were, I have no other
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19592:5"/>
warrant, then his owne
words, which (if not tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
overmuch, with the
bitterneſſe of a deſperate
mind, and bearing the
countenance rather of
paſsion, then of ſober
confeſsion) may ſeeme to
adde a period to all fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
commendations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I was</hi> (ſaid hee) <hi>exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively
covetous of money, and
accordingly I applyed my
ſelfe to get by injuſtice, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
juſtice by deceit, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
tricks to delude ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice:
good cauſes I either
defended deceitfully, or ſold
them to the adverſary perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19592:6"/>
ill cauſes I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
with all my might; I
wittingly oppoſed the known
truth, and the truſt commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto me, I either betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or perverted.</hi> Thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
worn out forty foure
yeares, or there abouts,
and the news of the new,
or rather newly revived
opinions of <hi>Luther</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
into thoſe parts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
an object of
noveltie unto him; who
being as deſirous to know
as hee was famous for
knowledge; ſuffered not
theſe wandring opinions
to paſſe unexamined, but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19592:6"/>
ſearching into the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and into all bookes
of Controverſie that hee
could get, both old and
new; and finding more
then fame or opinion, he
began to taſte their nature
ſo well, as he entertaines,
loves, and ownes them at
length; and with ſuch
zeale, as he became a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor;
yea a teacher of
them, firſt to his wife,
children, and family, and
after to his friends, and
familiar acquaintance; &amp;
in compariſon, ſeemed to
neglect all other affaires;
intending ever to preſſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19592:7"/>
this maine point, that <hi>We
muſt wholly, and only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on the free, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
love of God in
the death of Chriſt, as the
only ſure way to ſalvation:</hi>
and this was the ſumme
of all his diſcourſe, and
this continued for the
ſpace of ſixe yeares, or
there abouts; even ſo long
as this fire could keepe it
ſelfe within private wals;
but at length it brake
forth into publique mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings;
ſo as the whole
Province of <hi>Padua</hi> daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the luſtre thereof.
The Clergie finding the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19592:7"/>
trade of their pardons to
decay; and their Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
to waxe cold, began
to beſtirre themſelves;
gloſing their actions firſt
with calumnious aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion,
then more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtriking at <hi>Spira</hi> with
grievous accuſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: And
to effect their purpoſe,
ſome promiſe labour, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
favour, ſome advice,
others maintenance; all
joyne to divide, either his
ſoule from his body, or
both from God.</p>
            <p>Now was <hi>Iohn Caſa</hi>
the Popes Legate reſident
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19592:8"/>
at <hi>Venice,</hi> being by birth a
<hi>Florentine;</hi> and one that
wanted neither malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thoſe of this way,
nor craftines to effect his
malicious purpoſes: To
him theſe men repaire
with outcries againſt <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra;</hi>
that hee was the man
that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
rites of the Church;
deluded the Eccleſiaſticall
power, and ſcandalized
the policie thereof; one
of no meane ranke; being
a man of Account and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
and thereunto,
learned in the Scriptures,
elegant in ſpeech; and in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19592:8"/>
one word, a dangerous
<hi>Lutheran;</hi> having alſo
many diſciples, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not to be deſpiſed.</p>
            <p>At this began the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
to caſt his eye on the
terrible alteration that
lately had hapned in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie;</hi>
where, by the
means of one onely <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
the Romiſh Religion
had ſuffered ſuch a blow,
as that it could neither
bee cured by diſsimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nor defended by
power; but the Clergie
muſt either mend their
manners, or loſe their
dignities: on the other
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19592:9"/>
ſide, when hee ſaw how
propenſe the common
people inhabiting in the
bordering countries of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly</hi>
vvere to entertaine
thoſe new opinions, hee
now thought it no time
to diſpute, or perſwade,
but with ſpeed repaires to
the <hi>Senate,</hi> and procures
authoritie from them to
ſend for <hi>Spira.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spira</hi> by this time had
conſidered vvith himſelfe
of the nature of his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
how evident and
notorious it vvas, and
therefore ſubject to bee
envied by ſuch, as neither
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19592:9"/>
liked his perſon nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
hee perceived that
his opinions were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
retyred nor ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
but ſuch as aymed
at the overthrovv of the
<hi>Romiſh</hi> Faction, and at
change of Policie,
vvherein at the beſt, he
could expect but a blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
victory, and that his
enemies vvanted neither
povver nor occaſion to
call him to account in
publique, vvhen he muſt
either Apoſtatize, and
ſhamefully give his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
life, yea his ovvn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
the lye, or endure
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19592:10"/>
the utmoſt malice of his
deadly enemies, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
his wife, children,
friends, goods, authoritie;
yea, his deare Countrey;
and betake himſelfe to a
forraigne people, there to
endure a thouſand mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries,
that do continually
waite upon a voluntary
exile. Being thus diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and toſſed in the reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
waves of doubt,
without guid to truſt to,
or haven to flye to for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour;
on the ſudden Gods
Spirit aſsiſting, hee felt a
calme, and began to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe
with himſelfe in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19592:10"/>
this manner:</p>
            <p>Why wandreſt thou thus
in uncertainties, unhappy
man; caſt away feare, put
on thy ſhield, the ſhield of
faith; Where is thy wonted
courage, thy goodneſſe, thy
conſtancie? remember that
Chriſts glorie lies at the
ſtake, ſuffer thou without
feare, and hee will defend
thee, hee will tell thee what
thou ſhalt anſwer; hee can
beat downe all danger, bring
thee out of priſon, raiſe thee
from the dead; conſider <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
in the dungeon, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
in the fire, if thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt
a good confeſſion, thou
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19592:11"/>
mayeſt indeed goe to priſon,
or death, but an eternall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in heaven remaines
for thee; What haſt thou in
this world comparable to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life, to everlaſting
happineſſe? if thou doſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
thinke of the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall;
(common people live by
example, thinking what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is done, is well done)
feare the loſſe of peace and
joy, feare hell, death, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
wrath; or if thy
fleſh be ſo ſtrong, as to cauſe
thee to doubt of the iſſue, flie
thy Countrie; get thee away,
though never ſo far, rather
then denie the Lord of Life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:19592:11"/>
               <hi>Now was</hi> Spira <hi>in
reaſonable quiet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reſolved to yeeld to
theſe weightie reaſons;
yet holding it wiſedome
to examine all things,
hee conſults alſo with
fleſh and bloud; thus
the battaile doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new,
and the fleſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnes
in this manner:</hi>
Bee well adviſed, fond
man, conſider reaſons on
both ſides, and then judge:
how canſt thou thus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verweene
thine owne ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie,
as thou neither
regardeſt the examples
of thy Progenitors; nor
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19592:12"/>
the judgment of the whole
Church; doſt thou not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
what miſerie this thy
raſhneſſe will bring thee
unto? thou ſhalt loſe thy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
gotten with ſo much
care and travell, thou ſhalt
undergoe the moſt exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
torments that malice it

bee counted an heretique of
all: and to cloſe up all, thou
ſhalt die ſhamefully. What
thinkeſt thou of the loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
ſtinking dungeon, the
bloudie axe, the burning
fagot, are they delightfull?
Bee wiſe at length, and
keepe thy life and honour,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19592:12"/>
thou maiſt live to do much
good to good men, as God
commands thee, thou maiſt
be an ornament to thy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie;
and put caſe thy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
loſſe would bee of ſmall
eſteeme with thee; Wilt thou
bring thy friends alſo into
danger? thou haſt begotten
children, wilt thou now cut
their throats, &amp; inhumane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
butcher them, which may
in time bring honor to their
Countrie, glorie to God,
helpe and furtherance to his
Church: goe to the Legate
weake man, freely confeſſe
thy fault, and helpe all theſe
miſeries. <hi>Thus did the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19592:13"/>
cares of this world, and
the deceitfullneſſe of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
choke the good Seed
that was formerly ſowne;
ſo as fearing, hee faints,
and yeelds unto the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements
of this preſent
world, &amp; being thus blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
he goes to the Legate
at</hi> Venice, <hi>and ſalutes him
with this news.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having for theſe divers
yeares entertained an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
concerning ſome Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of faith, contrary to
the Orthodox and received
judgement of the Church;
and uttered many things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the authoritie of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19592:13"/>
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the
univerſall Biſhop: I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
acknowledge my fault
and errour, and my folly in
miſleading others: I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
yeeld my ſelfe in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to the Supreme Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
into the boſome of the

and Decrees of the

for what is paſt; and I
humbly begge pardon forſo
great an offence.</p>
            <p>The Legate perceiving
<hi>Spira</hi> to faint, he purſues
him to the utmoſt; hee
cauſeth a recitation of all
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19592:14"/>
his Errours to be drawne
in writing, together with
the Confeſsion annexed
to it, and commands <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>
to ſubſcribe his name
there, which accordingly
he did; then the Legate
commands him to return
to his owne Towne; and
there to declare this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion
of his, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
the whole Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> to be holy, and true;
and to abjure the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Luther,</hi> and other
ſuch Teachers, as falſe,
&amp; hereticall: <hi>Man knowes
the beginnings of ſinne, but
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19592:14"/>
who bounds the iſſues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?
Spira</hi> having once loſt
footing, goes downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,
he cannot ſtay, nor
gaine-ſay the Legate; but
promiſeth to accompliſh
his whole will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
he ſoone addreſſeth
himſelfe for his Iourney,
and being onward in the
way, bethinks himſelfe
of large ſpoyles hee had
brought away from the
Conflict with the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate:
what glorious te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
hee had given of
his great faith, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie
in Chriſts cauſe:
and to be plaine, how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19592:15"/>
hee had denyed
Chriſt, and his Goſpell at
<hi>Venice;</hi> and what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to do further in his
owne Country; and thus
partly with feare, and
partly with ſhame being
confounded; he thought
he heard a voyce ſpeaking
unto him in this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spira,</hi> What doſt thou
heere? whither goeſt thou?
haſt thou unhappy man, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
thy hand-writing to the
Legate at <hi>Venice;</hi> yet ſee
thou doſt not ſeale it in thine
owne Countrey: doſt thou
indeed thinke eternall life
ſo meane, as that thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:19592:15"/>
this preſent life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it? doſt thou well in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
wife and children
before Chriſt? is the windie
applauſe of the people, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
indeed then the glorie of
God; and the poſſeſſion of
this worlds good more deare
to thee, then the ſalvation
of thine owne Soule? is the
ſmall uſe of a moment of
time more deſireable, then
eternall wrath is dreadfull?
Thinke with thy ſelfe what
Chriſt endured for thy ſake;
is it not equall thou ſhouldeſt
ſuffer ſomewhat for him?
Remember, man, that the
ſufferings of this preſent
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19592:16"/>
life, are not comparable to
the glorie that ſhall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed:
if thou ſuffereſt
with him, thou ſhalt alſo
raigne with him: thou canſt
not anſwer for what thou
haſt alreadie done; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe,
the gate of mercie
is not quite ſhut, take heed
that thou heapeſt not ſinne
upon ſinne, leſt thou repent
when it will be too late.</p>
            <p>Now was <hi>Spira</hi> in a
wilderneſſe of doubts,
not knowing which way
to turne him, nor what to
doe, yet being arrived in
his owne Countrey, and
amongſt his friends, with
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:19592:16"/>
ſhame enough hee relates
what he had done, and
what he had further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to doe; and how
the terrors of God on the
one ſide, and the terrour
of this world on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, did continually
racke him; and therefore
hee deſired of them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
in this ſo doubtfull a
caſe: his friends upon
ſmall deliberation an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered;
that it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
hee ſhould take heed
that hee did not in any
wiſe betray his wife and
children, and all his
friends into danger, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19592:17"/>
that by ſo ſmal a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as the reciting of a
little Schedule, which
might bee done in leſſe
ſpace then half an houre,
he might both free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
from preſent danger,
and preſerve many that
depended upon him; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
moreover, that hee
could get no Credit in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting
from that which
he had already in greateſt
part performed before
the Legate at <hi>Venice,</hi> and
that in the perfect accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing
thereof, little or
no diſcredit could ariſe,
more then what by the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:19592:17"/>
former action already he
had ſuſtained: on the
other ſide, if hee did not
performe his promiſe
made to the Legate, hee
could neither diſcharge
himſelfe of the ſhame
which he had already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred;
nor avoyd farre
more heavy and inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
injuries, then
probably he ſhould have
endured, if hee had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
obſtinately in his
former Opinions.</p>
            <p>This was the laſt blow
of the battaile, and <hi>Spira</hi>
utterly overcome, goes to
the <hi>Praetor,</hi> and proffers
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:19592:18"/>
to performe his foreſaid
promiſe made to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,
who in the meane
time had taken order to
have all things ready, and
had ſent the inſtrument
of abjuration ſigned by
<hi>Spira,</hi> to the <hi>Praetor,</hi> by
the hands of a certaine
Prieſt. All that night the
miſerable man ware out
with reſtleſſe cares, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any minute of reſt;
the next morning being
come, he gets up, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ready, he deſperately
enters into the publique
Congregation, where
Maſſe being finiſhed, in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19592:18"/>
the preſence of friends
and enemies, and of the
whole Aſſembly; being
by eſtimation neere two
thouſand people; yea,
and of Heaven it ſelfe, he
recites that infamous ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration,
word for word,
as it was written: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
done, he was fined at
thirtie pieces of gold,
which he preſently paid:
five whereof were given
to the Prieſt that brought
the abjuration, the other
twentie five were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
towards the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of a <hi>Shryne</hi> to put the
<hi>Euchariſt</hi> in; then was
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:19592:19"/>
he ſent home reſtored to
his Dignities; goods,
wife, and children: No
ſooner was hee departed,
but he thought hee heard
a direfull voyce, ſaying to
him; <hi>thou wicked wretch,
thou haſte denyed mee,
thou haſt renounced the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of thy obedience,
thou haſt broken thy vow,
hence Apoſtate, beare with
thee the ſentence of thy eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

and quaking in
body and mind, fell down
in a ſwoune; reliefe was
at hand for the body,
but from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,

profeſſed that he was

of Chriſt that juſt

w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> God the Father
in his behalfe: thus was

before his eyes.</p>
            <p>Now began his friends
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19592:20"/>
ſome of them to repent
too late of their raſh
counſell; others not look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo high as the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, laid all the
blame upon his Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholicke
conſtitution;
that overſhadowing his
judgment, wrought in
him a kinde of madneſſe:
every on cenſured as his
fancy led him, yet for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
all agreed in this,
to uſe both the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
helpe of Phyſicians,
and the pious adviſe of
Divines, and therefore
thought it meet to convey
him to <hi>Padua,</hi> an Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19592:20"/>
of note, where plenty
of all manner of meanes
was to be had: this they
accordingly did, both
with his wife, children,
and whole family; others
alſo of his friends accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying
him: and being
arrived at the houſe of
one <hi>Iames Ardin,</hi> in Saint
<hi>Leonards,</hi> Pariſh, they
ſent for three Phyſicians
of moſt note, who upon
due obſervation of the
effects, &amp; of other Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes
of his diſeaſe, and
ſome private conference
one with another, among
themſelves, returned their
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19592:21"/>
verdict in this manner,
<hi>viz.</hi> That they could not
diſcerne that his body
was afflicted with any
danger or diſtemper ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
from it ſelfe, by
reaſon of the over-ruling
of any humour; but that
this Maladie of his did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe
from ſome griefe, or
paſsion of his minde,
which being overbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened,
did ſo oppreſſe
the ſpirits, as they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
free paſſage, ſtirred
up many ill humours,
whereof the body of man
is full; &amp; theſe aſcending
up into the braine, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
the fancie; ſhadowed
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19592:21"/>
the ſeat of the judgment,
and ſo corrupted it: this
was the ſtate of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe,
and that outward
part that was viſible to
the eye of nature, this they
endeavoured to reforme
by purgation, either to
conſume, or at leaſt to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the courſe of thoſe
humors from the braine;
but all their skil effected
nothing, which <hi>Spira</hi>
noting, ſaid: <hi>Alas poore
men, how farre wide are you;
doe you thinke that this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe
is to be cured by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
beleeve mee there
muſt bee another manner of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19592:22"/>
medicine, it is neither poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
plaiſters, nor drugs,
that can helpe a fainting
ſoule caſt downe with ſenſe of
ſinne, and the wrath of God;
it is onely Chriſt that muſt
bee the Phyſician, and the
Goſpel the ſole Antidote.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Phyſicians eaſily
beleeved him, after they
had underſtood the whol
truth of the matter, and
therfore they wiſhed him
to ſeeke ſome ſpirituall
comfort. By this time the
fame of this man was
ſpred over all <hi>Padua,</hi> and
the neighbour Countrey,
partly for that he was a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19592:22"/>
man of Eſteeme, partly
becauſe as the diſeaſe, ſo
the occaſion was eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
remarkeable; for this
vvas not done in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
ſo as daily there
came multitudes of all
ſorts to ſee him: ſome out
of curioſitie onely to ſee
and diſcourſe: ſome out
of a pious deſire to try all
meanes that might reduce
him to comfort againe, or
at leaſt to benefit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
by ſuch a ſpectacle
of miſery, and of the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of God. Amongſt
theſe, <hi>Paulus Vergerius</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Iuſtinopolis,</hi> and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19592:23"/>
               <hi>Mattheus Gribauldus,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
eſpecially to bee
named, as the moſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
labourers for this
mans comfort. They
finde him now about fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
years of age, neither
affected with the dotage
of old age, nor with the
unconſtant headſtrong
paſsion of youth, but in
the ſtrength of his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
and judgment; in
a burning heat calling ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsively
for drinke; yet
his underſtanding active,
quicke of apprehenſion,
wittie in diſcourſe above
his ordinary manner, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:19592:23"/>
judiciouſly oppoſite: his
friends laboured him by
all faire meanes to receive
ſome nouriſhment, which
he obſtinately gaine-ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they forcibly infuſed
ſome liquid ſuſtenance
into his mouth, moſt of
which he ſpit out againe;
exceedingly chafing, and
in this fretting mood of
his, ſaid: As it is true <hi>that
all things worke for the beſt
to thoſe that love God;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note> ſo to
the wicked all are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
<hi>for whereas a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
off-ſpring is the bleſſing
of God, and his reward, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a ſtay to the weak eſtate
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19592:24"/>
of their aged parents; to me
they are a cauſe of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and vexation; they doe
ſtrive to make mee tire out
this miſery; I would faine
be at an end; I deſerve not
this dealing at their hands;
O that I were gone from
hence, that ſome body would
let out this weary Soule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His friends ſaluted
him, and asked him, what
hee conceived to be the
cauſe of his diſeaſe; forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he brake out into a
lamentable diſcourſe of
the paſſages formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
&amp; that with ſuch
paſsionate Elocution, that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19592:24"/>
hee cauſed many to weep
&amp; moſt to tremble. They
contrarily to comfort
him, propounded many
of Gods promiſes recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the Scripture; and
many examples of Gods
mercy: <hi>My ſinne</hi> (ſaid he)
<hi>is greater then the mercy of
God.</hi> Nay, anſwered they,
the mercy of God is above
all ſin; God would have
all men to be ſaved: <hi>It is
true</hi> (quoth he) <hi>hee would
have all that he hath elected,

have damned reprobates to
be ſaved; I am one of that
number; I know it, for I
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19592:25"/>
willingly, and againſt my

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>After ſome ſilence, one
asked him whether hee
did not beleeve that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
(to bee true) for
which hee was accuſed
before the Legate; hee
anſwered;</hi> I did beleeve it
when I denied it, but now
I neither beleeve that, nor
the Doctrine of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Church; I beleeve
nothing, I have no faith, no

like <hi>Cain,</hi> or <hi>Iudas,</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:19592:25"/>
who caſting away all hope of

my friends doe mee great
wrong, that they ſuffer me not
to goe to the place of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
as I juſtly deſerve.</p>
            <p>Heere they beganne
ſharpely to rebuke him;
requiring, and charging
him that in any wiſe hee
did not violate the mercy
of God; to which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered:
<hi>The mercy of God
is exceeding large and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to all the elect; but
not to mee, or any like to
mee, who are ſealed up

came (ſaid they) to take

his nayling to the Croſſe,
<hi>Spira</hi> ſaid: <hi>This indeed is

conſider the theefe that

with a mercifull eye;
and in that he was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,

God was gracious

I am a reprobate: I

the bitterneſſe of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,

<hi>when I did denie thoſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,

why doe you (ſaid the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)

Erroneous: no, good

puniſhment,
without anie hope of
pardon;<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 11. and Rom. 4.</note> It is true that
the greatneſſe of ſin, or
the multitude of them,
cannot bind Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie:
all thoſe manie ſins
that in the former part
of my life I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
then did not ſo
much trouble mee, for I
truſted that God would
not lay them to my
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:19592:31"/>
charge: but now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſinned againſt the
holy Ghoſt, God hath
taken away from me all
power of repentance, &amp;
now brings all my ſins
to remembrance,<note place="margin">Iam. 2. 10.</note> and
thus guiltie of one, guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

it is no matter whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
my ſinnes be great

they are ſuch as Chriſt's

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:19592:31"/>
it that gnaws my heart,
hee hath hardned mee;
and I finde that he daily
more and more doth
harden mee; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I am out of hope:
I feele it, and therefore
cannot but deſpaire: I
tell you, there was never
ſuch a monſter as I am;
never was man alive a
ſpectacle of ſo excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
miſery: I knew
that juſtification is to be
expected by Chriſt; and
I denied, and abjured
it; to the end I might
keepe this fraile life
from adverſitie, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19592:32"/>
my children from po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie;
and now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
how bitter this
life is to mee; and God
only knowes, what
ſhall become of this my
family; but ſurely no
good is likely to betide
it, but rather daily
worſe and worſe; and
ſuch a ruin at the length
as that one ſtone ſhall
not be left on another.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But why ſhould you
(ſaid <hi>Gribauldus</hi>) conceit
ſo deepely of your ſinne,
ſeeing you cannot but
know that manie have
denied Chriſt, yet never
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:19592:32"/>
fell into deſpaire? <q>Well
(<hi>ſaid hee</hi>) I can ſee no
ground of comfort for
ſuch, neither can I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
them from Gods
reve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging hand in wrath;
though it pleaſeth God
yet to ſuffer ſuch to bee
in peace: and beſides,
there will a time of
change come, and then
they ſhall be throughly
tryed: and if it were
not ſo, yet God is juſt
in making mee an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
to others; and I
cannot juſtly complain:
there is no puniſhment
ſo great but I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:19592:33"/>
it, for this ſo
heinous offence: I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
you it is no ſmall
matter to denie Chriſt;
and yet it is more ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
then commonly
men doe conceive of:
it is not a deniall made
before a Magiſtrate as it
is with mee; for as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as a Chriſtian doth
diſſemble the knowne
truth, as often as hee
approves of falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
by preſenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
at it, ſo often as
hee doth not things
worthy of his calling,
or ſuch things as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19592:33"/>
of his calling:
ſo often hee denies
Chriſt: thus did I, and
therefore am juſtly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
for it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Your eſtate (quoth <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauldus</hi>)
is not ſo ſtrange
as you make it; <hi>Iob</hi> was
ſo farre gone, that hee
complained God had ſet
him as a marke againſt
him: and <hi>David</hi> that was
a man after Gods owne
heart, complained often
that God had forſaken
him, and was become
his enemy; yet both recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
comfort againe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
your ſelfe therefore,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:19592:34"/>
God will come at length,
though hee now ſeeme
farre off.</p>
            <p>
               <q>O Brother (<hi>anſwered</hi>
Spira) I beleeve all this;
the divels beleeve and
tremble; but <hi>David</hi> was
ever elected and deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beloved of God; and
though he fell, yet God
tooke not utterly away
his holy Spirit; and
therefore was heard
when he prayed, <hi>Lord
take not thy holy Spirit
from mee:</hi> but I am in
another caſe, being ever
accurſed from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of God: neither
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:19592:34"/>
can I pray as he did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his holy Spirit is
quite gone, and cannot
be recalled; &amp; therefore
I know I ſhall live in
continuall hardneſſe ſo
long as I live: O that I
might feele but the leaſt
ſenſe of the love of God
to mee, though but for
one ſmall moment, as I
now feele his heavie
wrath that burnes like
the torments of hell
within mee, and afflicts
my Conſcience with
pangs unutterable; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
deſperation is hell it
ſelfe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:19592:35"/>
Heere <hi>Gribauldus</hi> ſaid,
I doe verily beleeve, <hi>Spira,</hi>
that God having ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
chaſtiſed you in
this life, correcteth you in
mercie heere, that he may
ſpare you hereafter, and
that he hath mercies ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
up for you in time to
to come.</p>
            <p>Nay (<hi>ſaid</hi> Spira) hence
doe I know that I am a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate,
becauſe he afflicteth
mee with hardneſſe of heart:
Oh that my body had ſuffered
all my life long, ſo that hee
would bee pleaſed to releaſe
my ſoule, and eaſe my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
this burthened Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:19592:35"/>
               <hi>Gribauldus</hi> being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to eaſe his minde
from the continuall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
of his ſinne; as
alſo to ſound how for the
preſent he ſtood affected
to the Romiſh Church;
asked him what hee
thought became of the
ſoules of men ſo ſoone as
they departed out of the
bodie, to which hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
            <p>Although this bee not ſo
fully revealed in Scripture;
yet I verily beleeve that the
ſoules of the Elect goe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
to the Kingdome of
glory; and not that ſleep with
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:19592:36"/>
the bodie as ſome doe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</p>
            <p>Verie well; ſaid one of
the ſpectators, why doe
the Scriptures then ſay,
that God brings downe
to hell,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 6.</note> and raiſeth up;
ſeeing it cannot be meant
of the eſtate of the ſoule
after death, which as thou
ſayeſt, either goeth to
heaven without change,
or to hell without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption:
it muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
of the eſtate of
the ſoule in this life; like
that wherein thou art at
this preſent: and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
wee ſee that God
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:19592:36"/>
ſuffers men to fall into the
jawes of deſpaire, and yet
raiſeth them up again, and
therefore deſpaire not, but
hope; it ſhall bee even
thus with thee in his good
time.</p>
            <p>This is the worke, (<hi>quoth</hi>
Spira) this the labour; for
I tell you, when I at <hi>Venice</hi>
did firſt abjure my profeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and ſo, as it were, drew
an Indenture, the Spirit of
God often admoniſht mee;
and when at <hi>Cittadella, I</hi>
did, as it were, ſet to my
ſeale; the Spirit of God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ſuggeſted to mee, Doe
not write <hi>Spira,</hi> do not ſeale;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:19592:37"/>
yet I reſiſted the Holy
Ghoſt, and did both; and at
that very preſent <hi>I</hi> did evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
feele a wound infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in my very will, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<hi>I</hi> can ſay, <hi>I</hi> would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve;
yet can <hi>I</hi> not ſay <hi>I</hi>
will beleeve; God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
mee the power of will;
and it befalls mee in this my
miſerable eſtate, as with one
that is faſt in irons, and his
friends comming to ſee him,
doe pitie his eſtate, and doe
perſwade him to ſhake off his

hee would faine doe, but
cannot, this is my very caſe;

you perſwade me to beleeve:

It is wonderfull, <hi>I</hi> earneſtly
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:19592:38"/>
deſire to pray to God with

yet <hi>I</hi> cannot ſet my ſelfe to

the puniſhments of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
they confeſſe what <hi>I</hi>
confeſſe, they repent of their

doth them no good,
for they cannot mend their

            <p>
               <hi>As he was thus ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

            <p>O <hi>Spira</hi> (ſaid they) you
know you are in a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall

therefore not beleeve what
Satan ſuggeſts; hee was
ever a lyar from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,

            <p>O here is the knot (<hi>ſaid</hi>

But I cannot.</p>
            <p>Then he began to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
up what fearefull
dreames and viſions, hee
was continually trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
withall; that hee
ſaw the divels come floc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
into his Chamber,
and about his bed, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying
him with ſtrange
noiſes; that theſe were
not fancies, but that hee
ſaw them as really as
the ſtanders by; and that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:19592:42"/>
beſides theſe outward
terrours, hee felt continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
a racking torture of

            <p>Caſt theſe fancies (ſaid

            <p>Theſe promiſes (<hi>ſaid

fall into ſin, but are againe
lifted up and recovered out:
as the Prophet ſaith, though

are effectuall to all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
but this faith, and this

that hee would give it mee;

            <p>Vpon what grounds

            <p>
               <q>I once did know God
to bee my Father, not

onely by creation; but
by regeneration, I knew
him by his beloved
Sonne, the authour and
finiſher of our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
I could pray to him,
and hope for pardon of

a taſte of his ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

now contrarily,
I know God not as a

            <p>They came another day

               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:19592:50"/>
brother God hath put

            </p>
            <p>Here <hi>Vergerius</hi> began

vehemently, by all the

hee bare to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
yea to his owne
ſoule: that he would ſet
himſelfe ſeriouſly, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to that faith and

ſhould I beleeve? God
hath taken faith from

whither I ſhall goe:
ſhew mee a haven
whereto I ſhall retire:
you tell mee of Gods

hath caſt mee off: you
tell mee of Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſsion,
I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
him: you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
mee to beleeve,
I ſay I cannot: you
bring mee no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:
your command
is as impoſsible for
me to obey, as to keep
the Morall Law: if
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:19592:52"/>
you ſhould perſwade
one to love God, with
all his heart, ſoule and
ſtrength; and God
gives him not the
power, can he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
your deſire?
doth not the church
teach us to ſing; direct
us, O Lord, to love thy
commandements: hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
ſay that they
love God with all
their heart, but they
lye: for my part, I will
not lye, but tell you
plainely; ſuch is my
caſe, that though you
ſhould never ſo much
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:19592:53"/>
much importune mee
to hope or beleeve,
though I deſire it, yet
I cannot: for God (as
a puniſhment of my
wickedneſſe) hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away from me all
his ſaving graces;
faith, hope, and all:
I am not the man
therefore that you take
mee for: belike you
thinke I delight in
this eſtate; if I could
conceive but the leaſt
ſparke of hope of a
better eſtate hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to endure the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:19592:53"/>
moſt heavie weight
of the wrath of that
great God; yea, for
twenty thouſand years,
ſo that I might at
length attaine to the
end of that miſery,
which I now know
will bee eternall; but
I tell you, my will
is wounded: who
longs more to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
then I doe? but
all the ground-worke
of my hope is quite
gone; for if the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies

not carrying an obſcure

expreſſing the image of

give all diligence by righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,

that ſnatch at the promiſes

and beeing flattered by

You may interpret the

and guiltie of high Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
againſt his Majeſtie;
I am a caſt-away, a vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile
of wrath: yet dare
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:19592:58"/>
you call it diſſembling and
frenzie; and can mocke
at the formidable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the heavie wrath of
God, that ſhould teach you
feare and terrour; but it
is naturall to the fleſh, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
out of malice or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
to ſpeake perverſly
of the workes of God, the
naturall man diſcerneth
not of the things that are
of God, becauſe they are
ſpiritually diſcerned.</p>
            <p>How can this be (ſaid
<hi>Gribauldus</hi>) that you can
thus excellently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God, and of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:19592:58"/>
the graces of his holie
Spirit, that you finde the
want of them, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
deſire them; and
yet you thinke you
are utterly deprived of
them.</p>
            <p>Take this for certaine
(<hi>ſaid hee</hi>) I want the
maine grace of all, and
that which is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie;
and God doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times extort moſt true
and ſtrange teſtimonies of
his Majeſties juſtice and
mercie; yea out of the
mouthes of verie repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates,
for even <hi>Iudas,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hee had betrayed his
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:19592:59"/>
Maſter,<note place="margin">Mat. 27. 4.</note> was conſtrained
to confeſſe his ſinne, and
to juſtifie the innocencie
of Chriſt; and therefore
if <hi>I</hi> doe the like, it is no
new or ſtrange matter:
God hath taken faith from
mee, and left mee other
common gifts, for my dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
condemnation; by how
much the more I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
what I had, and heare
others diſcourſe of what
they have, by ſo much the
more is my torment, in that
I know what I want, and
how there is no way to bee
relieved.</p>
            <p>Thus ſpake hee, the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:19592:59"/>
teares all the while
trickling downe; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsing
that his pangs
were ſuch, as that the
damned wights in hell
endure not the like mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie;
that his eſtate was
worſe, then that of <hi>Cain</hi>
or <hi>Iudas;</hi> and therefore
hee deſired to die: <hi>yet
behold</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>the
Scriptures are accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in mee;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 9. 6.</note> 
               <hi>they ſhall deſire
to die, and death ſhall flie
from them;</hi> and verily,
hee ſeemed exceedingly
to feare, leſt his life
ſhould bee drawne out
to a longer thread: and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:19592:60"/>
finding no eaſe, or reſt,
ever and anone cried
out: <hi>O miſerable wretch;
O miſerable wretch;</hi> then
turning to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
hee beſought
them in this manner.</p>
            <p>O Brethren, take a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
heed to your life;
make more account of the
gifts of Gods ſpirit then <hi>I</hi>
have done, learne to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
my miſery, thinke not
you are aſſured Chriſtians,
becauſe you underſtand
ſomething of the Goſpel;
take heed you grow not
ſecure on that ground; be
conſtant and immoveable
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:19592:60"/>
in the maintaining of your
profeſſion, confeſſe even
untill death if you be called
thereto: he that loveth
father,<note place="margin">Luk. 14. 26.</note> mother, brothers,
ſiſters, ſons, daughters,
kindred, houſes, lands,
more then Chriſt, is not
worthie of him.</p>
            <p>Theſe words (ſaid
they) doe not ſound like
the words of a wicked
Reprobate.</p>
            <p>I doe but herein imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
(<hi>ſaid Spira</hi>) the rich
Glutton in the Goſpel, who
though in hell; yet was
carefull that his brethren
ſhould not come to that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:19592:61"/>
place of torment: and I
ſay to you Brethren, take
heed of this miſerable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
wherein <hi>I</hi> am.</p>
            <p>Then turning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to certaine young
men that were preſent,
hee deſired them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him aright: <q>I
doe not ſpeak this, to
derogate from the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie
of ſaving faith,
and the promiſes of
the Goſpel, for they
are moſt ſure; but
take heed of relying
on that Faith that
works not a holy and
unblameable life, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:19592:61"/>
of a beleever;
credit mee, it will
faile, I have tried it:
I preſumed I had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the right faith, I
preached it to others,
I had all places of
Scripture in memorie,
that might ſupport it:
I thought my ſelfe
ſure, and in the meane
time, living impiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and careleſly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
now the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken
mee, not to
correction, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation;
and now
you would have mee
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:19592:62"/>
to beleeve, but it will
not bee; for I feele
too late; that good
things belong onely
to ſuch as are good;
whoſe ſinnes are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with Chriſts
death and bloud, as
with a vaile, and
guarded with his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
merits from the
floud of Gods warth,
even as with a mightie
wall; left miſerable
mortals ſhould bee
ſwallowed up with
the greatneſſe of their
ſinnes: But as for
mee, I have as it were
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:19592:62"/>
wilfully with mine
hands pulled downe
this rampire; behind
which I might have
reſted in ſafetie; and
now are the ſwelling
waters come even to
my ſoule: and I am
caſt away.</q>
            </p>
            <p>One of his familiar
friends chanced to ſay,
that certainly he was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
with melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly;
which being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verheard,
<hi>Spira</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:</p>
            <p>
               <q>Well, bee it ſo, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you will needs
have it ſo; for thus
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:19592:63"/>
alſo is Gods wrath
manifeſted againſt me
in that hee hath taken
from mee the uſe of
mine underſtanding
and reaſon, ſo as I
can neither rightly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme
and judge of
my diſtemper, nor
hope of remedie: you
ſee Brethren, what a
dangerous thing it is,
to ſtoppe or ſtay in
things that concerne
Gods glorie: eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to diſſemble upon
anie termes: what a
fearefull thing is it to
be neare, and almoſt a
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:19592:63"/>
Chriſtian; never was
the like example to
this of mine: and
therefore if you bee
wiſe, you will ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
conſider therof;
Oh that God would
let looſe his hand from
me; that it were with
me now, as in times
paſt; I would ſcorn the
threats of the moſt
cruell Tyrants, beare
torments with invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
reſolution, and
glorie in the outward
profeſsion of Chriſt,
till I were choked in
the flame, and my
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:19592:64"/>
body conſumed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>You ſay you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate,
O <hi>Spira</hi> (ſaid
they) why then doe you
not ſtrive with ſome
weapon or other, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
to make an end of
your life, as deſperate
men uſe to doe? Let mee
have a ſword (ſayd <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>)
why what would
you doe with it (quoth
they) <hi>I cannot tell you</hi>
(ſaid hee) <hi>what this
minde would move me to
upon occaſion; nor what I
would doe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They perceiving ſmal
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:19592:64"/>
effect of all this their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
but rather that he
grew worſe: for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding
of concourſe of
people; for everie day
ſeldome fewer then 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
continued with him, &amp;
to ſtop the courſe of
fame, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
blowne abroad
of him; they conſult to
carry him backe againe
into his owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey:
and thoſe his
friends that came to
comfort him, began to
take their leaves of him:
<hi>Vergerius</hi> among the reſt,
required that at their
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:19592:65"/>
parting they might pray
together with him: <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>
hardly conſented,
and as unwillingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed:
for hee ſaid,
<q>My heart is eſtranged
from God, I cannot
call him Father from
my heart; all good
motions are now quite
gone, my heart is full
of malediction, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
and blaſphemy
againſt God; I finde I
grow more and more
hardned in heart, and
cannot ſtoope nor
helpe my ſelfe; your
prayers for mee ſhall
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:19592:65"/>
turne to your owne
benefit, they can doe
mee no good.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vergerius</hi> came to
take his leave of him,
whom <hi>Spira</hi> embracing,
ſaid, <q>Although I know
that nothing can bring
any benefit to mee a
Reprobate; but that
every thing ſhall tend
to my deeper condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
yet I give you
moſt hearty thankes,
for your kinde office
of love and good will;
and the Lord returne
it unto you with a
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:19592:66"/>
plentifull increaſe of
all good.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The next day being
brought downe to his
intended Iourney, by
the way looking round
about him with a ghaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
looke, he ſaw a knife
lying on a Table, to
which he running haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſnatched hold of; as
intending to miſchiefe
himſelfe; but his friends
laying hold of him,
ſtopped him in his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:
whereupon with
indignation, hee ſaid,
<q>I would I were, above
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:19592:66"/>
God, for I know hee
will have no mercy
on me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus went he home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
often ſaying,
that the envied the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Iudas:</hi>
hee lay about 8. weekes
in this caſe, in a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
burning, neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring,
nor receiving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing but by force,
and that without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion:
ſo ſpent, that
hee appeared a perfect
<hi>Anatomie;</hi> expreſsing
to the view, nothing
but ſinewes and bones;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:19592:67"/>
vehemently raging for
drinke; ever pining, yet
fearefull to live long;
dreadfull of hell, yet co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veting
death; in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
torment, yet his
own tormentour: and
thus conſuming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
with griefe and
horrour, impatience, &amp;
deſpaire; like a living
man in Hell; hee repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
an extraordinary
example of the juſtice
and power of God: and
thus (as farre as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth)
within a few dayes
after his arrivall at his
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:19592:67"/>
owne home, he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this preſent life. Yet
an occaſion to make us
remember, <hi>that ſecret
things belong unto the
Lord our God;</hi> but cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
to man, to teach
him to hope all things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:19592:68"/>
EXtraordinary exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Divine Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
God never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for a nine dayes
wonder: elſe would hee
when hee exemplifi'd

ſnow, not of laſting
ſalt; which ſtood as

of Ieruſalem: and as
