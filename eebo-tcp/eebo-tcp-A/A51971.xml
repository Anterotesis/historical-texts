         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>Chóice of Grounds.</head>
               <p>The Grounds to breed on would be ſpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and not ſtrait, for Horſes joy not in Cages. There accommodate according to your Stock; and though the more the merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, yet the fewer the better fare. They would not be extreme fertile, nor extreme barren; the golden mean is the beſt temper: yet to incline a little to hardneſs, is better then much rankneſs; the one breeds health, the other diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Let the Situation be aſcending, the Air pure, the Laire dry, and the Foot-tread firm, no matter how rough or incertain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>As much Ground as will keep a Milch-Cow, will keep a Milch-Mare, and a great dealleſs when ſhe is barren or unwrought.</p>

               <head>Change of Grounds.</head>
               <p>Again, as Change of Paſture makes fat Calves, ſo Alteration of Grounds raiſes gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Colts. Therefore ſtrive to have one Ground to foal in, another to ſummer in, and a third to winter in.

               <p>Thus far for thoſe which have ability. But for them which muſt breed for neceſſity, let his Yard, Back-ſide, or Stable ſerve to foal in, the white Corn-fields to ſummer in, and the Cratch or Stand-heck to winter at.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Choice of Stallions and Mares</head>
               <p>Next the Change of Grounds, I place the Choice of Stallions and Mares, which is a Theme I have ſo oft written of, that I muſt needs refer the Curious to thoſe larger Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, and only in this place ſay, That for as much as all men covet to be governed by their own paſſions, therefore I leave them to their own choice, and the end for which they breed; yet adviſing them, that of thoſe Races
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56504:10"/>
of which they make election, they chooſe the beſt and a bleſt, the higheſt ſpirited, the faireſt coloured, and the fineſt ſhaped; whether it be Neapolitan, Turk, Spaniard, Barbary, Engliſh, Dutch, Polander, French or Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. And becauſe it is impoſſible to finde out abſolute perfection, I would have our Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to inform himſelf well of all the natural defects that can be found in the Stallion, and to amend them in the Mare that ſhall be joined with him; and what is amiſs in the Mare, to ſee it repaired in the Horſe.</p>
               <p>For any ſingular election of Mares, the Breeder need not be too curious; only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that if you can get true breed, you then paſs by the baſtard; if you may have the the gentleman, never make uſe of the clown. But when you are tyed by neceſſity or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, then ſee the mare have a good fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, a large womb, ſound limbs, fair co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and good metal. For the reſt, let nature alone, ſhe is a brave Miſtreſs.</p>
               <p>Now for thoſe Breeders which look not ſo much into the breed and generation of the Horſe, as into his actions and good dayes works; accounting because he hath won ſuch a wager, or beaten ſuch a horſe, therefore he muſt neceſſarily be an excellent Stallion: let them know they are deceived; for this is no good conſequence; no more then if a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56504:10"/>
robuſtrous ſtrong skillfull Clown ſhould give a weak unskilfull Gentlemen a fall, therefore all the Clown-breed ſhould be excellent wra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtlers. This can hold for no Maxim; for I am perſwaded, that let a Gentleman have either skill to encounter ſtrength, or ſtrength to encounter skill, there is no clown that can foil him. In like manner a Clown-horſe by training, feeding, and riding, may beat a true bred horſe; but when they encounter upon equal terms, Truth will ſhew herſelf for a miſtreſs. Therefore in this caſe of Breeding, get as neer as you can true Breed, and it will ſeldom or never bring forth Repentance.</p>

               <head>The Age of Stallions and Mares:</head>
               <p>A Horse may beget good Colts from four years old to fourteen; after, he declineth: and a Mare may bring forth from three years old to thirteen, and then ſhe decayeth: yet are neither utterly loſt, but both may be made to ſerve for the ſame uſe a much longer ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>Moderate labour is good for Breed of Mares, when they go over; for it maketh them apt to take the horſe, and ſoon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:56504:11"/>
               <head>When to put Horſe and Mare together.</head>
               <p>The abſolute beſt time to put the horſe and Mares together, is the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> provided there be ſtrength and luſt in both. For, the earlier the Foal falleth, finding no want or ſcarceneſs, the better Horſe is ever produced: And ſo conſequently from the beginning of <hi>May;</hi> the Foals that fall after ſuch a time cannot chuſe but have imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion in ſome condition. For they have two great enemies to encounter withal (not before known) which daily fall upon them, that is, Hunger and Cold, with which the early Foal hath been before familiar.</p>
               <p>There be ſome Horſemen which hold that the Lammas Foal proves ever an excellent Horſe; and I diſſent not from it, where there is plenty and fulneſs of keeping; for he knows the worſt of Winter before Summer appear, and ſo may be good and hard; but if he chance to be pinched with either, the ſmalnes of his ſtatute will leſſen his goodneſs, and his weakneſs make uſeleſs his hardneſs.</p>
               <p>The Lammas Foals are commonly known by many obſcure feathers out of their own ſights, as under their eyes, upon their necks, creſts, and under their chaps. To conclude, it is not good to put the Horſe to the Mares
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56504:11"/>
at all, till you find ſome ready, (ſpeaking of a general putting together) for ſo the Horſe loſeth his ſtrength unfruitfully, and ſhe gets nothing but chaſing and miſchiefs.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>When Mares are fit for the Horſe.</head>
               <p>To know when your Mares are ready (if it be in a wild Stud) obſerve their chaſing and galloping up and down morning &amp; evening, and their inconſtancie of abiding in any one place, eſpecially throwing their noſes to the North and South, the lifting up of their tails, riding one anothers backs, wooding one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, oft piſſing, or opening of their ſhares and cloſing them again, all are ſigns of luſt: if you will make a more particular trial, then prove them with ſome ſtoned Tit or Jade.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>How to put them together.</head>
               <p>When your Mares are ready, the queſtion is how they ſhall be put together, whether abroad at random for ſundry weeks, or at home in private for a night or two?</p>
               <p>If abroad, let your fence be good, your food ſweet, and your ſhelter ſufficient. If in the houſe, then in ſome empty Barn or ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious place, which may be free from danger of poſts or other occaſion of ruſhes: And
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56504:12"/>
let them remain from ſunſet till ſunriſe, and two nights are ſufficient.</p>
               <p>Now there is a third manner of covering, and I preferr it for the beſt, becauſe it keeps the Stallion longer in ability, and ſerves the Mare with a great deal more certainty: And that is, firſt to be ſure to have them both at one dyet, as the Mare at graſs and the horſe at ſoil; then finding the Mare (by tryal) ready, put them together into ſome cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walled Paddock, where there is ſtore of ſweet graſs and ſweet water, juſt upon the going down of the ſun, and as neer as you can obſerve, either three days after the change, or three days before the full of the Moon, and let them remain cloſe together two whole nights and one day, and take the horſe from her at ſunriſe.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>How many Mares for one Horſe.</head>
               <p>If you cover abroad (as I ſpake before, at random) an Horſe may well ſerve twelve Mares, if you expect no other ſervice of him. If you cover in the houſe, where he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary keeping and little chaſing, he will ſatisfie fifteen: But if you cover in the Pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock, then I have known an high ſpirited Horſe for own year ſerve to keep you Mares <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As if it be for Hunting, Running, Travel, Hackney, or the like, then the chiefeſt things you are to apply your ſelf unto, are to preſerve a good mouth, to trot freely and comely, to amble ſurely and eaſily, to gallop ſtrongly and ſwiftly, to obey the hand in ſtopping gently and retiring willingly, and to turn on either hand readily and nimbly. To all which I will give you lights in their ſeverall places. But if you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him for the great ſaddle, or the uſe of the wars, then although the leſſons be the ſame, yet they are to be taught and done in a more punctual manner, and ask more nice and artificial demonſtrations. So that if an horſe can be brought to the beſt, the eaſier muſt needs follow with little induſtry. And it is a Rule in Horſmanſhip, that no leſſon which belongs to the wars can be hurtfull or
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56504:20"/>
do injury to any horſe whatſoever that is kept for any other purpoſe. Whence it cometh, that every horſe for the wars may be train'd for a Runner or Hunter at pleaſure; but every Runner or Hunter will not ſerve the wars: And every Horſman that can make an horſe for the wars, may be a Jocky when he pleaſes; but no Jocky (that I know) can make an horſe for the wars. Therefore I will run a middle way, and ſuit my leſſons for both purpoſes.</p>

When your horſe is either ſo wythie cragg'd (as the Northern man calls it) or ſo looſe and unſteady-necked, that which way ſoever you draw your hand, his head and neck will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, ſometimes beating againſt your knees,

ſometimes daſhing againſt your boſom, nay ſometimes knocking you in the face; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed generally ſo looſe and incertain, that a man cannot ſay at any time he hath certain or ſteady hold of him. A vice wonderfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to Running-Horſes, eſpecially the hot furious ones. In this caſe you ſhall take theſe long Reins; and as before you drew them to the buckles of the gyrths, ſo now Marting<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thus ride him with a conſtant hand, firm and ſomwhat hard; correcting him both with the ſpurs and rod, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with ſharp twitches in his mouth when he errs; and with a few weeks labor, his head will come to a conſtant carriage, provided that you labor him as well upon his Gallop as his trot, and leave him not till you find him fully reclaimed.</p>

            <head>THE OFFICE OF THE FEEDER.</head>
            <head>An Introduction to the Work, touching the limitation of time for preparing the Running-Horſe.</head>
            <p>I Will not diſpute the ſeverall opinions of men in this Kingdom touching the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Running horſe, becauſe I know many are idle and frivolous, ſome incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and a few in the right way. Only in this work I would cleer one paradox, which is ſtrongly maintained and infinitely purſued by many of our beſt profeſſors; and that is the limitation or length of time for the preparing or making ready of an Horſe for a Match or great wager.</p>
            <p>There be divers, nay ſome which I know carry the Goddeſſes on their backs, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm an Horſe which is exceeding fat, foul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> newly taken from graſs, ſoil, or lofty, liberal
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56504:29"/>
and unbounded feeding, cannot be brought to the performance of his beſt labour under ſix moneths, five is too little, and four an act of impoſſibility. By which they rob their Noble maſter of half a years pleaſure, thruſt upon him a tyring charge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to make the ſport loathſom, and get nothing but a cloak for ignorance, and a few falſe got Crowns that melt as they are poſſeſſed.</p>
            <p>Yet as Heretiques cite Scriptures, ſo theſe find Reaſons to defend want of knowledge.</p>
            <p>As, the danger of too early exerciſe; the offence of greaſe ſuddenly broken; the moving of evill humors too haiſtily, which leads to mortal ſickneſs.</p>
            <p>And the moderation or helping of all theſe by a ſlow proceeding, or bringing of the horſe into order by degrees and time, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> (as I may ſay) by an ignorant ſufferance.</p>
            <p>Theſe Reaſons I know have the ſhew of a good Ground; for too early exerciſe is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, but not if free from violence.</p>
            <p>To break greaſe too ſuddenly is an offence unſufferable, for it puts both limbs and life in hazard, but not if purged away by whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſcourings.</p>
            <p>The haſty ſtirring up of humours in a body where they ſuperabound, and are generally diſperſed, and not ſetled, cannot chuſe but breed ſickneſs; but not where diſcretion and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56504:29"/>
judgment evacuateth them in wholſom ſweats and moderate airings.</p>
            <p>And for t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e moderation of all theſe, by the tediouſneſs of Time, as two months for the firſt; two moneths for the ſecond, and as much for the laſt: It is like the curing of the Gangrene in an old man; better to dye then be diſmembred, better loſe the prize then bear the charge: For I dare appeal to any noble judgment, whoſe purſe hath experience in theſe actions, if ſix moneths preparation and the dependances belonging to it and his perſon do not devour up an hundred pounds wager.</p>
            <p>But you will demand of me what limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of time I will allow for this purpoſe of preparation? And I anſwer, that two moneths is ſufficient at any time of the year whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, for an old horſe, or an horſe formerly trained, for I ſpeak not of Colts; and he that cannot do it in two moneths, ſhall never do it in ſifteen.</p>
            <p>But reply they, No ſcouring is to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, for they are phyſical; they force na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo hurt nature; they make ſickneſs, and ſo impair health: And that indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is comparable to the length of time, becauſe Nature worketh every thing her ſelf; and though ſhe be longer, yet ſhe hath leſs danger.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:56504:30"/>I confeſs that Sybbeſauce ſcourings which are ſtuft with poiſonous ingredients, cannot chuſe but bring forth infirmity; but whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Scourings, that are compoſed of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall and nouriſhing Simples, neither occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſickneſs nor any manner of infirmity, but bring away greaſe and all foulneſs in that kindly and abundant ſort, that one week ſhall effect more then two moneths of dilatory and doubtfull for bearance.</p>
            <p>I call it dilatory and doubtfull, becauſe no man (in this lingring courſe) can certainly tel which way the gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> all theſe fall out according to the ſtrength and eſtate of the Horſes body, and the diligence of the Feeder: And if either the one fail in power; or the other in care, farewell Horſe for that year.</p>
            <p>All this Envy cannot chuſe but confeſs; only they have one broken crutch to ſupport them, which is, They know no Scouring, therefore they will allow of no Scouring.</p>
            <p>Againſt Barbariſm I will not diſpute, only I appeal to Art or Diſcretion, whether Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation or Sufferance; when Nature is offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, be the better doers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:56504:30"/>But they reply, by a figure called Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, That whatſoever is given to any Horſe more then his natural food, and which he will naturally and of his own accord with all willingneſs receive, is both unproper and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſom; and therefore he ought not to be forced with any thing againſt his appetite. This I have heard them ſay, and to this I thus anſwer.</p>
            <p>The natural food of Man is bread only, all other things (according to the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher) are ſuperfluous, and ſo to be avoided. At this argument both Humanity and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity laughs: For, other helps, as Phyſick, divers meats, and divers means ordained for both even by the power of the Almighty himſelf, tells the contemners hereof how groſsly they erre in this fooliſh opinion.</p>
            <p>Nay, allow them a little ſhadow of truth, That things moſt natural, are moſt beneficial: then it muſt follow, that Graſs, or Hay (which is but withered Graſs) is moſt natural, and ſo moſt beneficial. Now Graſs is phyſical, for in it is contained all manner of Simples of all manner of mixtures, as hot, cold, moiſt, dry; of all qualities, all quantities. So that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I give (which is good) is but that which he hath formerly gathered out of his own nature, only with this difference; That what he gathereth is in a confuſed manner,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56504:31"/>
clapping contraries together ſo abundantly, that we are not able to judge where the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant quality lyeth; and that which we compound is ſo governed by art and reaſon, that we know how it ſhould work, and we expect the event, if it be not croſt by ſome greater diſaſter.</p>
            <p>But will they bind themſelves to keep the Running-horſe only with Graſs or Hay? They know then the end of their labour will be loſs. Nay, they will allow Corn, nay di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Corns; ſome nouriſhing and looſing, as Oats and Rye; ſome aſtringent and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as Beans; and ſome fatting and breeding both blood and ſpirit, as Wheat: nay, they will allow Bread, nay Bread of divers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and divers mixtures, ſome before heat, and ſome after, ſome quick of diſcreſion and ſome ſlow. And if this be not as phyſical as any Scouring a good Horſman gives, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> report me to him that ſhall read the Bills.</p>
            <p>Nay, theſe Contemners of Scourings will allow an Egg, nay an Egg mixt with other ingredients: And for Butter and Garlick, they will uſe it, though it be never ſo fulſom. The reaſon is, becauſe their knowledge can ariſe to no higher a ſtair in phyſick; and authoriſed Ignorance will ever wage battel with the beſt Underſtanding: like fooliſh Gallants on St. <hi>Georges</hi> day, who neither
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56504:31"/>
having ability to buy, nor credit to borrow a Gold-chain, ſcorn at them that wear them; or <hi>Martin Marprelate,</hi> that not having Learning worthy of a Deacon, found no fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity but in railing at divine Fathers.</p>
            <p>There are another ſort of Feeders, which in a contrary extream run beyond theſe into miſchiefs; and thoſe are they which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcour their horſes, and are never at peace but when they are giving Potions (which they call Scourings) ſomtimes without cauſe, always without order, bringing upon an horſe ſuch intolerable weakneſs, that he is not able to perform any violent labour.</p>
            <p>From this too little, and too much, I would have our Feeder to gather a mean; that is, Firſt to look that his Simples be wholſom: then to the occaſion, that he is ſure there is foulneſs: and laſtly to the eſtate of body, that he may rather augment then decreaſe vigor. So ſhall his work be proſperous, and his actions without controllment.</p>
            <p>To conclude, Two months I allow for preparation, and according to that time have laid my Directions. Mine humble ſuit is, out of a ſincere opinion to Truth and Juſtice, ſo to allow or diſallow, to refrain or imitate.</p>

               <head>The firſt ordering of the Running-horſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſeveral eſtates of their Bodies.</head>
               <p>This office of the Feeder, albeit in general it belong to all Horſmen, yet it particular it is moſt appropriate to the Feeder of the Running-horſe; becauſe other general horſes have a general way of feeding, theſe an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial and preſcript form, full of curioſity and circumſpection; from which whoſoever errs, he ſhall ſooner bring his horſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction then perfection.</p>
               <p>Therefore when an Horſe is matcht, or to be matcht for a Running courſe, you art principally to regard the eſtate of body it which the horſe is at the time of his match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And this eſtate of body I divide into three ſeveral kinds.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, if he be very fat, foul, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taken from graſs or ſoil.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, if he be extream lean and poor, either through over-riding, diſorder, or other infirmity.</p>
               <p>And the third, if he be in good and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking eſtate, having had good uſage and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate exerciſe.</p>
               <p>If he be in the firſt eſtate of body, you ſhall take longer time for his feed, as two
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56504:32"/>
moneths at the leaſt: for he will ask much labour in airing, great carefulneſs in heating, art and diſcretion in ſcouring, and rather a ſtrict then liberall hand in feeding.</p>
               <p>If he be in the ſecond eſtate of body (which is poor) then you ſhall alſo take a longer time as you may, yet you need not ſo much as in the former; both becauſe Graſs cannot much hurt, and exerciſe may go hand in hand with feeding.</p>
               <p>This horſe would have moderate and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full airing, as not before or after ſun, rather <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If he be in the third eſtate of body, which is a mean betwixt the other extreams, then a moneth or ſix weeks, or a fortnight or leſs, may be time ſufficient to diet him for his Match<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now as this eſtate participates with both the former, ſo it wou'd borrow from them a ſhare in all their orderings, that is, to be neither too early, nor too late in airings; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now as you regard theſe general eſtates of bodies, ſo you muſt have an eye to certain particular eſtates of bodies: As if an horſe be

Then you ſhall take a quart of ſweet, dry, old and clean dreſt Oats, of which the heavieſt are the beſt, as thoſe which we call Poland-oats or Cut-oats: For thoſe which are unſweet, breed infirmity; thoſe which are moiſt, cauſe ſwelling in the body, thoſe which are new, breed worms; and they which are half dreſt, deceive the ſtomack and bring the horſe to ruine.</p>
               <p>As for the black Oats, though they are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable in the time of neceſſity, yet they make foul dung, and hinder a mans knowledg in the ſtate of the horſes body.</p>
               <p>This quart of Oats you ſhall ree and dreſs wondrous clean in a Sive that is much leſs then a Riddle, and though bigger then a Reeing-ſive, ſuch an one as will let a light Oat go through, but keep a full one from ſcattering, and ſo give them to the horſe; and if he eat them with a good ſtomack, you may give him another, and ſo let him reſt till it be eleven a clock:</p>
               <p>Then come to the Stable, and having rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed his head, neck and face, dreſs him another quart of Oats (as before) and give it the horſe; then cloſing up the windows and lights leave him till one a clock.</p>

the better it is, and it will occaſion him to lye down and take his reſt, when otherwiſe he would not; and therefore we commonly uſe to arm the Stables wherein theſe horſes ſtand round about a loſt, and over the Rack with Canvas, both for darkneſs, warmth, and that no filth may come near the horſe.</p>
               <p>At one a clock come to him, and dreſs him another quart of oats, and give them as before, after you have rubbed his head and nape of the neck: then putting away his dung, and making the ſtable clean, give him a knob of Hay, and ſo leave him till eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>

               <p>Then cloath, ſaddle, bring him forth, urge him to empty, mount, rack him abroad, but not to the hills, if you can finde any other plain ground, as meadow, paſture, or the like, eſpecially if it lye along by a River, but in this caſe you can be no chuſer, but muſt take the moſt convenient, making a vertue of neceſſity.

paſſages, eſpecially when you would have him to empty, to let him ſmel upon every old and new dung you meet withall, for this will clear his body and repair his ſtomack.</p>
               <p>When you have watred, and ſpent the evening in airing till within night, (for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more wholſom, or ſooner conſumeth foulneſs, then early and late airings:) You ſhall then rack him home to the ſtable-door; there alight and do as you did in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, both within doors and without, and ſo leave him on his bridle for an hour and more. Then come again, and as you did in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, ſo do now; Rub well, draw his bridle, cleanſe the Manger, put up his ſcattered hay, ſift him a quart of Oats, and ſo let him reſt til nine a clock at night.</p>
               <p>At nine a clock come to him, and firſt rub down his legs with wiſps, or with a clean cloth, or with your bare hands (which is beſt of all) then with a clean cloth rub his face, head, chaps, nape of the neck and foreparts, then turn up his cloathes and rub over all his hinder parts; then put down his clothes, and ſift him a quart of Oats and give them him; then put into his Rack a little bundle of hay, toſs up his litter and make his bed ſoft, and ſo leave him till the next morning.</p>

The true uſe of them is to keep the horſe from eating up his litter, from gnawing upon boards and mud-walls, and indeed to keep him from eating any thing but what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth from your own hands.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Muzzels are ſomtimes made of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſtampt full of holes, or elſe cloſe, but they are unſavoury and unwholſom: for if it be allomed leather, the allom is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; if it be tann'd or liquored leather, the Tanners ouze and greaſe are fully as unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant. Beſides, they are too cloſe, and too hot, and both make an horſe ſick, and cauſe him to retain his dung longer in his body, then otherwiſe he would do.</p>
                  <p>The beſt Summer Muzzell, (and indeed the beſt generally at all times, is the Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muzzell, made of Strong pack-threed, and knit exceeding thick and cloſe in the bottom, and ſo inlarged wider and wider upward, to the middle of the horſes head; then bound about the top with Tape, and on the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide a loop, and on the farre-ſide a long ſtring to faſten it to the horſes head.</p>
                  <p>The beſt Winter-muzzell (and indeed
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56504:40"/>
tolerable at any time) is that which is made of double Canvas, with a round bottom and a ſquare lattice window of ſmall tape before both his noſtrils, down to the very bottom of the muzzell, and upward more then a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: this muſt alſo have a loop and a ſtring to faſten it about the horſes head.</p>

fleſhy part of the fore-thighs, that the horſe will not be able to go without halting before, and cringing and crambling his hinder parts ſo ill-favouredly, that it will be irkſome to behold it: beſides, it will occaſion ſwellings, and draw down tumors, which will be more noyſom then the pace will be beneficiall.</p>

                  <p>OUtward Sorrances are diſcerned when any member or part in an horſe is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured or evill affected by the loſs of true ſhape, diſability in motion, the increaſe or decreaſe of number and quantity, the diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of place, or the ſeparating of things knit and united. And theſe accidents have divers names, as Impoſthumes, Ulcers or wounds when they are in fleſhy parts; Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Fractures on and in the bones; Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the veins; convulſions in the ſinews, and Excoriations upon the skin.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is known by outward ſwellings, rotten or bloody ſores; the next by utter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability in the member, or elſe plain halting. The next by Wens and Knots both ſoft and hard; the next by gordgings and haltings, and the laſt by ſcurf and leproſie:</p>
                  <p>Now foraſmuch as the greateſt part of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:56504:84"/>
Sotrances, and eſpecially thoſe which are moſt hid and obſcure, are found our by hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, I will ſhew you the ſeverall manner of haltings, and what they ſignifie.</p>
                  <p>If the horſe halt before, and lift not up his leg, but in a manner traileth it after the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it ſheweth a new hurt on the top of the ſhoulder.</p>
                  <p>If he caſt his leg outward, or go Baker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and not bend the knee, it is either an old hurt on the top of the ſhoulder, or if new, then it is a ſhoulder-plat, or rending betwixt the ſhoulder and the body: if in turning ſhort he favour his foot, if griping his withers he complain, if he halt more when he is ridden then led, the offence is on the top of the ſhoulder: If ſtanding in the ſtable, thruſt forth his foot and favour it: then ſearch his foot, and if in that be found no prick, no dry founder, no ſurbat, then it is in the mid part of the ſhoulder, or the coffin joynt.</p>
                  <p>If halting he bow down his head to the ground, and ſtep ſhort and thick, then it is in the forepart of the ſhoulder, at the breaſt. If in handling his elbow hard, he twitch up his foot ſuddenly from the ground, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is there.</p>
                  <p>If on his ſhank bones (in their ſeverall places be ſplents, excreſſions, windgalls or
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56504:85"/>
Maleanders, and they ſore, they will occaſion halting, as any other outward Sorrance upon any other member.</p>
                  <p>Heat on the Crownet ſhews pain in the Coffin joynt.</p>
                  <p>In halting before, to trip on the Toe, ſhews pain in the heel; to favour the Toe, ſhews payn in the Toe; to halt more on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even ground then one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>If your horſe halt behind, and in halting go ſidelong, and not in an even line, the grief is in the hip, and yet but new, or in the Fillets, and may be new or old. If it be old in the hip, the hip will fall, and then no cure</p>
                  <p>If in halting he tread onely on his hinder Toe, and no offence in the foot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then the pain is in the ſtiffell. If in halting he bend not his hough or ham, and no outward Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, yet the pain is there.</p>
                  <p>If he halt through any offence in his leg from the ham to the paſtern, outward Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or ſwelling will ſhew it; and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for the other parts below it.</p>
