            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Nſtead of an Epiſtle, thou ſhalt have my reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
concerning ſome particulars, principally agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at this time, and neceſſary to be premiſed.</p>
            <p>1. Concerning Politicall and Regall Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Power, and the Author thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Politicall</hi> Authority,<note place="margin">Politicall and Regall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, &amp; the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor thereof.</note> is the power which the Supreame
Magiſtrate hath over mens Perſons and Eſtates, over their
Lives and Fortunes; and ſuch is the power of a King in his
Kingdom: And that power with us is to be exerciſed by the King
according to the Lawes of the Land. The originall thereof is
from God; who is the only Potentate, <hi>The King of Kings, and
Lord of Lords, 1. Tim.</hi> 6. 15. and from none other, Men or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells:
For the Creatures generally are under the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>Thou ſhalt not kill, Thou ſhalt not ſteale.</hi> And then
cannot by any Authority of their owne, warrant any man to take
away anothers Life without Murther, nor his Eſtate without
Theft. Only God, who is the Lord of Life and Death, the Lord
Poſſeſſor of Heaven and Earth, the Creator of all things, and
therefore hath a Naturall Dominion over all, can Authorize
in theſe caſes: And he gives this Authority to Kings and other
ſupreame Magiſtrates, his Vicegerents, and Deputies here on
earth, for the administration of Iuſtice, and for the effectuall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
of Sinne and Vice, by the utmost of Corporall and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
puniſhments, and for the maintenance of Order and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
amongſt men. And ſo the Apoſtle tells us, That <hi>there is
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113299:3"/>
no Power but of God, Rom.</hi> 13. 1. And in the Scripture Kings
are called Gods Annointed; Annointed with power, as the Holy
Ghoſt phraſeth it, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 38. Yea they have the Compellation
of God himſelfe, becauſe, ſaith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Perkins, they partake of
his Power in their Authority, and of his glory in their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty.</hi>
And <hi>Daniell</hi> tells us thrice in one Chapter, <hi>That the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
alſo are Gods, and he giveth them to whom he will.</hi> 4.
<hi>Dan.</hi> 17. 25. 32. For inſtance, 'tis by the Grace of God that our
<hi>Soveraigne Lord Charles</hi> is King of <hi>England, Scotland, &amp;c.</hi>
And in theſe Kingdomes He conſtitutes Governours alſo as he
will; either by His own Nomination or by Naturall Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or by the Peoples Election: I know that too, to the end Popes
might uſurp power over Kings, 'tis the Tenent of the Papists,
and of the Parliament party,<note place="margin">Kings have not their Power from the People.</note> That the King hath his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
from the People, and that they may reaſſume it. But this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
is founded in Blasphemy, looſens the bonds of Loyalty,
advanceth Popular inſolency, leads on to Rebellion, and ends in
Anarchy, and Confuſion.</p>
            <p>And in truth all the People doe in this caſe, or can doe, is this;
They may in Order to the Divine diſpoſition of things, and in
ſome tlaces they doe (not without Gods eſpeciall Inclination
and direction) elect ſuch a one to be their King, but they doe not,
they cannot, inveſt him with Royall Authority and power; which
he hath from God alone, at his Inauguration, or firſt entrance
upon his Kingly Office; according to that Commiſſion, <hi>Dixi Dii
eſtis, I have ſaid ye are Gods: Pſal.</hi> 82. 6. As in Corporations,
the Inhabitants doe elect the Major, but they doe not conferre on
him his Authority, which he hath from the Kings Charter on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
inveſting him with ſuch power, and giving them power alſo of
electing him, which they could not have done without ſpeciall
Licence from the King. And as it is of the Kings ſingular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and indulgence, that they choſe their Governour; And as,
for all their Elections, the Major is <hi>Miniſter Regis,</hi> the Kings
Minister, conſtituted in Authority by and under him, in that
Corporation, to repreſent his Perſon, and to diſcharge his Offices
So it is between God, the King, and People, in poynt of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Miniſtration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:113299:3"/>
And as God conſtituteth every Supream Governour, ſo doth
he every kind of Government in the World; according to the
Confeſſion of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> delivered in theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
words.</p>
            <p>We confeſſe and acknowledge Empires, Kingdomes, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
and Citties to be diſtincted, and ordained by God;
the Powers and Authorities in the ſame, be it of Emperours
in their Empires, Kings in their Realmes, Dukes and Princes
in their Dominions, and of other Magiſtrates in their Citties,
to be Gods holy Ordinance, ordained for the manifeſtation of
his owne glory, and for the ſingular profit and commodity of
mankind:<note place="margin">Antient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions not to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne.</note> So that whoſoever goeth about to take away, or
confound the whole State of Cavill Policies now long eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
we affirme the ſame men not only to be enemies to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
but alſo wickedly to fight againſt Gods expreſſed will.</p>
            <p>And hitherto appertaineth that Maxime. <hi>Qui introducit
mala, peccat contra voluntatem Dei revelatam in verbo: qui
nova introducit, peccat contra voluntatem Dei revelatam in
factis:</hi> He that introduceth evill things, ſinneth againſt the
will of God revealed in his word: and he that introduceth
new things, ſinneth againſt the will of God revealed in his
workes.</p>
            <p>2. Concerning the Kings Negative Vote in Parliament,<note place="margin">The Kings negative Vote in Parliament.</note> which
the two Houſes would utterly overthrow: And to that end they
alledge the forme of an Oath in <hi>Hen:</hi> the fourths time, which
they ſay the Kings of <hi>England</hi> uſually took at their Coronation:
and whereby they promiſe to protect the Lawes, and to Corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
ſuch as the People ſhall chuſe:<note place="margin">The Kings Oath to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborate ſuch Lawes as the People ſhall chuſe.</note> 
               <hi>quas vulgus juſte &amp; ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabiliter
elegerit</hi> (as it is rendred, <hi>Rot. clauſ. 1. R. 2. nu.</hi> 44.)
which the people ſhall chuſe juſtly and reaſonably: And ſuch was
not the firſt controverted Bill of the <hi>Militia;</hi> for it was both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
(to take the Kings Power from him) and unreaſonable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
without the <hi>Militia</hi> he cannot, according to his Oath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
the Lawes; And the true ſence of that branch of the Oath
is expreſſed by that forme uſed at the Coronation of <hi>Edw:</hi> the
ſixth. <hi>Doe you grant to make no new Lawes, but ſuch as
ſhall be to the honour of God, and to the good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113299:4"/>
and that the ſame ſhall be made by the conſent
of your People, as hath been accuſtomed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that branch in the Kings Oath, To <hi>Corroborate ſuch
Lawes as the People ſhall chuſe,</hi> muſt not be underſtood uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally,
That the King is ſworne to paſſe all thoſe Lawes that
the People ſhall chuſe, but reſtrictively, that he ſhall enact only
ſuch Lawes as the People have choſen, and none other; And it is
only a restraint and limitation of that abſolutenes in Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
exerciſed by the Kings of <hi>England</hi> formerly, from which
they receded by degrees: uſing firſt the advice of the Biſhops and
Barons in making their Lawes, and afterward their Conſents
alſo: then not their advice and conſent only, but alſo the advice
and conſent of the Commons alſo. And hitherto doth the clauſe
in the Oath relate, To the end that no Law, not agreeing with
the Intereſt of every of the three formall parts of the Kingdome
might paſſe, to the maiming and enfeebling of the eſtabliſhed
frame of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>And theſe formes in <hi>Rich:</hi> 2. and <hi>Edw:</hi> 6. are cited by the
Lords and Commons in their Remonſtrance. 2. <hi>Novem.</hi> 1642.</p>
            <p>3. Concerning the Kings Councells. Beſide his great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
the Lords and Commons in Parliament, The Law takes
notice of the Kings Power to Sweare unto himſelfe a body of
Councell of State,<note place="margin">The Kings ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells.</note> (which our Lawes call ſometimes his Grand
Councell) and to ſweare unto him all Councellors at Law; even
the Judges, and others learned in the Law, thoſe to adviſe him
in matters of State,<note place="margin">Cook <hi>upon</hi> Littleton. <hi>l.</hi> 2. c. 1. Sect. 164.</note> theſe in matters of Juſtice: And hence is
that Maxime in Law, <hi>The King can do no wrong;</hi> if any ill be
committed in matters of State, the Councell, if in matters of
Juſtice, the Judges muſt anſwer for it. And it will be very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous
to make the two Houſes of Parliament the Kings only
Councellors in theſe caſes; if things ſhall be managed by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
part of the Houſe of Commons, as now they are: for that
Houſe hath not in it an hundred Knights of the Shires, and three
or foure hundred Citizens and Burgeſſes, which may be all Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks,
and ſo unfit Councellors in thoſe caſes: And who with
the help of the Tumultuous People about <hi>London,</hi> may deale
with the King and Nobles, and Gentry as they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:113299:4"/>
And becauſe the two Houſes are a numerous body, and the
King a ſingle Perſon, therefore to counterpoiſe them, doth the
Law expreſſe the King hath a Councell of State, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors
at Law, faithfully to adviſe him in his Government, that
be may neither doe, nor receive any wrong, especially in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where the wrong may be perpetuall.</p>
            <p>How unjuſt then, and unreaſonable is it at this time, to debarre
or remove thoſe Councellors from His Majeſty, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
no legall cauſe againſt them, to which the King hath ever
ſubmitted them?</p>
            <p>4. Concerning the <hi>Tumults</hi> raiſed and countenanced this
Parliament, whereof if any man doubt, let him conſider,</p>
            <p>1.<note place="margin">Tumults this preſent Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament.</note> That multitudes of People went to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> with Clubs
and Swords; crying, <hi>No Biſhops, No Biſhops.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That they aſſaulted the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and would not ſuffer them
to come to, and ſit in the Houſe of Lords.</p>
            <p>3. That upon the Complaint of the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> the Houſe of Lords
twice moved the Houſe of Commons to joyne with them in
an order againſt Tumults.</p>
            <p>4. That the Lords having in vaine tryed that way (upon the
advice of the Judges) ſent a Writ to the Sheriffe and Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
for ſetting watch and ward, and hindring all Tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Reſort to <hi>Weſtminſter:</hi> And for it one of the Juſtices
was ſent to the <hi>Tower</hi> by the Houſe of Commons.</p>
            <p>5. That they aſſaulted, and evill entreated ſome of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

a desperate Petition to the Houſe of Commons, againſt ſome

            <p>Now by the ancient Law and cuſtome of the Parliament,
a Proclamation ought to be made in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Parliament, <hi>That no man upon paine to looſe all
that he hath, ſhould during the Parliament in</hi> London, West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,

to fetch in Refractory Delinquents, and to bring them to cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne
puniſhment: But who are thoſe Delinquents? Such as
apply themſelves to the King, and were ready to aſſiſt him in the
Recovery of his Rights taken from him;<note place="margin">1. The fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents.</note> his Magazine at <hi>Hull,</hi>
the Power of the <hi>Militia,</hi> the dispoſition of the Forts and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
his Navy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for other Delinquents, His Majeſty left them to their
Justice at the beginning of the Parliament: And they proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
againſt whom they pleaſed. The Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and the
Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> but whether they or their Judges
proved Delinquents, moſt men now know. And yet they ſpared
whom they pleaſed in Relation to their Deſigne, as the Lord
<hi>Privy Seale, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, as thoſe Delinquents were of their owne making,
ſo the neceſſity of raiſing an Army to bring them in, was from
themſelves; for whereas that is done ordinarily by the <hi>Poſſe
Comitatus,</hi> they had diſſolved it by their Vote, 15. <hi>March.</hi>
1641. That the ſeverall Commiſſions granted under the <hi>Great
Seale,</hi> to the Lievtenants of the ſeverall Counties, are illegall
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:113299:5"/>
and voyd. Though ſuch Commiſſions had been in uſe during
the Reignes of, King <hi>Iames,</hi> and Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of bleſſed
Memory; and the ordering of the <hi>Militia</hi> had been ever in the
Crowne: And the Crown hath its Cuſtomes as well as the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
his, and not to be violated by the Subject.</p>
            <p>So then <hi>Armes</hi> were taken up, not in a judiciary way to force
Delinquents properly ſo called, and to puniſh offenders againſt
Law; but in the way of State Policy to ſubdue the Kings friends,
and their oppoſites; not to doe Juſtice, but to promote their
deſignes.</p>
            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">2. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of our Religion and Liberty.</note> ſometimes it is pretended, that the King indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured

            </p>
            <p>But our <hi>Liberties</hi> were all aſſerted by ſeverall Acts paſſed at

            <p>And to ſecure our <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and the whole

the ſeverall Counties, <hi>Feb.</hi> 28.</p>
            <p>And what need then of an <hi>Army,</hi> to defend and ſecure our
<hi>Liberties,</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> againſt <hi>Tyrannie</hi> and <hi>Popery?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the truth is, this pretended <hi>neceſſary defence</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
of our <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> againſt <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie,</hi>

it is manifeſt <hi>Rebellion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That in every <hi>Rebellion,</hi> the Law intendeth as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
the compaſſing the death and deprivation of the King;
as foreſeeing that the Rebel will never ſuffer that King to
live or Raigne, which might puniſh or take revenge of their

            <p>And at the Arraignment of Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Blunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Subject that Rebelleth or riſeth in forcible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,

intendeth to deprive the King both of <hi>Crowne</hi> and <hi>Life;</hi> And
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:113299:7"/>
that the Law judgeth not of the Fact by the intent, but of the

            <p>How then, is not this <hi>Rebellion</hi> in thoſe who are now riſen
in forcible manner to overrule the Royall will and power of
the King; and have put themſelves into ſuch ſtrength, as the
King ſhall not be able to reſiſt them, thereby to force and
compell the King (in ſome particulars) to governe otherwiſe
then according to his owne Royall Authority and direction,
and to take from Him the power of governing in ſome caſes;
as of the <hi>Church,</hi> and of the <hi>Militia</hi> of the <hi>Kingdome?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in proſecuting this <hi>Rebellion,</hi> how have they incurred
ſeverall <hi>Treaſons?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. By endeavouring to corrupt the judgement of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">The preſent Rebellion and Treaſon.</note>
and to take off the bonds of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> the greateſt ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of His Majeſty, and to draw the Peoples hearts from the
King, and to ſet diſcord between him and them, whereby
they ſhould leave the King, and riſe up againſt him.</p>
            <p>2. By levying <hi>Warre</hi> againſt the King in his <hi>Realme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. By deteining his <hi>Forts</hi> and <hi>Caſtles</hi> from him; and his
<hi>Ships</hi> and his <hi>Ordinance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. By encountring in <hi>Fight,</hi> and killing them that aſſiſt
him, and by adhering to the Kings Enemies, and giving them
ayd and comfort.</p>
            <p>5. By compaſſing the death and deprivation of the King:
Rebels never ſuffering that King to Live or Raigne, which
might puniſh or take revenge of their <hi>Treaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the method obſerved in this <hi>Rebellion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Method uſed in this preſent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</note> was this.</p>

When they could not compaſſe their deſigne by <hi>Vote</hi> in

            <p>Beſides, they require the Ceſſation in <hi>Ireland</hi> to be made

            </p>
            <p>True it is,<note place="margin">How the King is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready: And how they would farther reſtraine him.</note> that in ſome points of Regality and Soveraignty,
the King of <hi>England</hi> is already reſtrained and limited, ſo that
He cannot rule and governe abſolutely as He will, as in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Lawes (which He cannot doe, but with the Conſent
of the Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament,) and in
declaring of Lawes, (which He cannot doe, but by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Iudges in His ſeverall Courts) but in all other things that
are not expreſſely reſtrained by Law, He is free and abſolute,
and the Soveraignty both of Iudgement and Power, is in the

it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they would farther limit and reſtraine the King, that

both Houſes of Parliament in ſome Caſes, according to the

the Kings Soveraignty, <hi>Legiſlative</hi> and <hi>Gubernative.</hi>

            <p>This is a falſe and Treaſonable ſuggeſtion,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> as <hi>Owen's</hi> was,
to corrupt the judgement of the People, and to take off the
bonds of <hi>Conſcience</hi> towards His Majeſty, by advancing the
Houſes of Parliament above the King.</p>
            <p>And the falſeneſſe and Treaſonableneſſe thereof will plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appeare, upon the due Conſideration of the Kings Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority
to the two Houſes of Parliament, and of the Relation
between His Majeſty and the Lords and Commons aſſembled
in Parliament, and between them and us out of Parliament.</p>
            <p>1. Touching the point of Superiority between the King
and the Parliament,<note place="margin">The King ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to the two Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> the two Houſes themſelves have long
ſince determined it. The Parliament 25. <hi>H.</hi> 8. declares thus;
<hi>This your Grace's Realme recognizing no Superiour under God
but your Grace.</hi> The Parliament 16. <hi>R.</hi> 2. 5. affirmes the
Crowne of <hi>England</hi> to have been ſo free at all times, that it
hath been in no earthly Subjection, but immediatly to God in

none other. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The two Houſes of Parliament cannot of
Right have or exerciſe any authority over the Crowne, or the
Realme, over the King or the Subject of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though ſome Parliaments called in troubleſome times

depoſed and murthered ſome Kings, yet ſuch inſtances prove
no more claime of Soveraignty in the Parliament, over the
King, then a <hi>Robber,</hi> when he exerciſeth an Arbitrary power
over a mans perſon and purſe; And the Obſervator himſelfe
confeſſeth ingeniouſly, that <hi>there was never King depoſed in a
free Parliament: And that the Acts of the Parliament</hi> R. 2.
<hi>were not ſo properly the Acts of the two Houſes, as of</hi> H. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Nor is it <hi>Treaſon</hi> only, but <hi>impiety</hi> alſo to advance the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
(the Repreſentative of the people) above the King,
(the Repreſentative of God:) And it is to ſet up Kings and
not by God. (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8. 4.) Yea and againſt him too.</p>
            <p>2. Touching the Relation between the King and the
Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament,<note place="margin">The Lords &amp; Commons in Parliament ſubjected to the King.</note> we muſt know
this: That the high Court of Parliament conſiſts of three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrall
parts; the King, the Houſe of Lords, and the Houſe of
Commons. The King is the <hi>Head,</hi> and the two Houſes are
the groſſe <hi>Body</hi> ſubordinate to the King; and to be conſidered
alwayes as a part of the Parliament, and in a notion under the
King, as well in Parliament, as out of Parliament: and they are
ſubjected to the King in Parliament.</p>
            <p>1. In their perſons;<note place="margin">In their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> for the King calls them together and
diſſolves them. And as they have occaſion to petition the
King in Parliament they confeſſe themſelves his Subjects:
and directing their Petitions to His Majeſty, thereby they
acknowledge his Soveraignty; Majeſty being a <hi>Ray</hi> of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty.
Yea the very <hi>Legiſlative Acts</hi> wherein conſiſts their
Parliamentary Eminency ſpeake them alwayes his Subjects,
and ſtile him their Soveraigne: And according to the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Iudges in the time of <hi>H.</hi> 8. The King in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſtandeth in his higheſt Eſtate Royall, in reſpect of the
exerciſe of his Soveraigne Authority and power in making
Lawes, which he cannot doe but in Parliament. Beſides, in
token of his Soveraignty and their ſubjection the King perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
taketh <hi>Homage</hi> and Oath of <hi>Fidelity</hi> of the Lords, and
he Commands the Commons before they <hi>Sit</hi> and <hi>Vote</hi> in the
Houſe to take the Oath of <hi>Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Allegiance,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:113299:11"/>
they acknowledge him to be the only <hi>Supream Governour</hi>
in this <hi>Realme,</hi> and ſweare to aſſiſt and defend all <hi>Juriſdictions,
Priviledges, Preheminences,</hi> and <hi>Authorities,</hi> belonging to
him, his Heires and Succeſſors, or annexed to the Imperiall
Crowne of the Realme. And farther the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
in this preſent Parliament have bound themſelves by
their Proteſtation, to maintaine and defend with their Lives,
power and Eſtates, His Majeſties Royall Perſon, Honour, and
Eſtate. So the Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament,
are in the condition of Subjects to His Majeſty, and they have
ſworne <hi>Fidelity</hi> and <hi>Allegiance</hi> to him; and therefore they
cannot riſe up againſt the King, and compell him, as aforeſaid,
without manifeſt <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and <hi>Perjury</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>2. In their <hi>Votes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In their Votes.</note> in paſſing <hi>Bills,</hi> and making <hi>Lawes;</hi>
wherein though they concurre with the King neceſſarily, yet
'tis not by equall Authority but by conſent only; not as joynt
Soveraignes, but as free Subjects; not as enacting with the
King, but as chooſing, and preparing and propoſing Lawes to
be enacted by the King; according to the paſſage in the Oath,
<hi>That the King ſhall Corroborate ſuch Lawes as the People ſhall
chuſe:</hi> And without this Corroboration, by the Royall aſſent,
which gives life and motion to our Lawes, the Votes of the
two Houſes of Parliament dye in the wombe where they
were Conceived, like an <hi>Embrio,</hi> and never ſee the light.</p>
            <p>3. Touching the Relation between the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
aſſembled in Parliament,<note place="margin">They are our fellow Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</note> and our ſelves out of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
we take them to be no other than our fellow Subjects,
and them with us, and us with them, to be equally ſubjected
to our Soveraigne Lord the King, who is Head both of the
Kingdome and of the Parliament, and to none other. Nor are
they inveſted with any Superiority over us, but are armed
with ſome priviledges againſt us, that we cannot arreſt them
or their ſervants during the Parliament: And in caſe of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi>
and <hi>Treaſon,</hi> they are no more priviledged, then we
out of Parliament.</p>
            <p>So then the Lords and Commons'aſſembled in Parliament
are wholly ſubjected to the King, their <hi>Perſons</hi> to his <hi>Perſon,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:113299:11"/>
and their <hi>Votes</hi> to his <hi>Vote;</hi> nor are we in any ſubjection to
them or their <hi>Votes;</hi> nor have they <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> over us, nor
are we bound to the obſervance of them in any caſe whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
and our ſubmiſſion to them at any time, is an Act of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
only, and arbitrary, and not of obedience and duty.</p>
            <p>And their <hi>Votes</hi> and <hi>Ordinances,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Their Votes in this Caſe.</note> in this caſe at this time, are
not legall <hi>Obligations upon,</hi> but <hi>Traiterous Propoſitions to,</hi> and
publick Invitations of the people to joyne with them, and
aſſiſt them in their <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Treaſon.</hi> And their partakers
doe not ſo properly obey them, (having no Authority of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand)
as conſpire with them.</p>
            <p>Thus the Lords and Commons of <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">All one, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion be by the Subject in Parliament, or out of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</note> being alwaies
ſubjected to the King by the conſtitution of the Kingdome,
and of the Parliament, it is all one whether a <hi>Rebellion</hi> be
hatched, and Acted by them in, or out of Parliament; and if
there be any aggravation, 'tis when perpetrated in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for ſuch <hi>Rebellion</hi> leaves a Brand upon that Parliament,
and is a diſhonour to all Parliaments, it involves in the ſinne
the whole Kingdome for the preſent, and is an ill preſident
for time to come: and how ſhall we be ever hereafter liable
to change, and upon change to inteſtine diviſions, and to civill
Warre, it may be, if (as this doth) ſo other Parliaments ſhall,
challenge to themſelves abſolute power to alter the eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
Government of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State;</hi> and if oppoſed, to
take up Armes for effecting it, as at this day.</p>
            <p>But though the name of both Houſes of Parliament, be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to Authorize and countenance this Rebellion, yet the
Lords and Commons generally doe not concurre in this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
But a great part of the Houſe of Commons, and a great
part of the Houſe of Lords, driven from <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
of Tumults, and upon the Horror of their proceedings
there, doe oppoſe it, both by their Declarations and by force
of Armes.</p>
            <p>And the Lords and Commons now remaining at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Party of the Lords &amp; Commons, only engaged in this Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</note>

their Fellow Subjects, their fellow <hi>Rebells,</hi> and Fellow

            <p>It is obſerved by antient Parliament-men out of Record,<note place="margin">Parliaments have not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded well in five Caſes.</note>

            <p>We ſhall alſo have (when they can agree upon it) the

            <p>And their Rebellion is an attempt to force and compell
