            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>REASONS</hi> for the Indictment of the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> Preſented to the Grand-Jury of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> 
               <date>Saturday June 26. 80.</date> By the Perſons here under-nam'd.</head>
            <p n="1">I. BEcauſe the 25.<hi>Car.</hi>II. when an Act was made to throw Popiſh Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants out of all Offices and Places of Truſt; The Duke of <hi>YORK</hi> did lay down ſeveral Great Offices and Places, (as Lord High Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of <hi>England, Generaliſſimo</hi> of all His Majeſties Forces both by Land and Sea, Governour of the Cinque-ports, and divers others;) thereby to avoid the puniſhment of that Law againſt <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. 30. <hi>Car.</hi> II. When an Act was made to Diſable <hi>Papiſts</hi> from ſitting in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Houſe of Parliament; There was a <hi>Proviſo</hi> inſerted in that Act, <hi>That it ſhould not extend to the Duke of</hi> York; On purpoſe to ſave his Right of Sitting in the Lords Houſe, though he refuſeth to take thoſe Oaths which the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Peers</hi> ought to do.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That His Majeſty in his Speech <hi>March</hi> 6. the 31. Year of his Reign, doth give for a Reaſon to the Parliament, why he ſent his Brother out of <hi>England</hi>; becauſe he would leave no man room to ſay, that he had not remov'd all Cauſe which might influence him to <hi>Popiſh Councels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. That there have been divers Letters read in both Houſes of Parliament, and at the Secret Committees of both Houſes, from ſeveral Cardinals, and others at <hi>Rome</hi>; and alſo from other <hi>Popiſh Biſhops,</hi> and Agents of the <hi>Pope,</hi> in other Foreign parts, which do apparently ſhew the great Correſpondencies between the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>Y.</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi>: And how the <hi>Pope</hi> could not chooſe but weep for Joy, at the reading ſome of the Dukes Letters; and what great ſatisfaction it was to the <hi>Pope</hi> to hear the D. was advanc'd to the Catholick Religion. That the <hi>Pope</hi> hath granted <hi>Breev's</hi> to the D. ſent him <hi>Beads,</hi> ample <hi>Indulgences,</hi> with much more to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="5">V. That the whole Houſe of Commons hath declared him to be a <hi>Papiſt</hi> in their Votes, <hi>Sunday, April</hi> 6. 1679. Reſolved, <hi>Nemine Contradicente, That the Duke of</hi> York's <hi>being a Papiſt, and his hopes of coming ſuch to the Crown, has given the greateſt Countenance and Encouragement to the preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy and Deſigns of the Papiſts againſt the King and Proteſtant Religion.</hi> —What this Conſpiracy and Deſign is, will appear by a Declaration of both Houſes of Parliament, <hi>March</hi> 25. 1679. <hi>Reſolved,</hi> Nemine Contradicente, <hi>by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in Parliament Aſſembled; That they do Declare, That they are fully ſatisfy'd, by the Proofs they have heard, There now is, and for divers Years laſt paſt hath been a Horrid and Treaſonable PLOT and Conſpiracy, Contriv'd, and carried on by thoſe of the Popiſh Religion, for the Murthering of his Majeſties Sacred Perſon, and for the ſubverting the Proteſtant Religion, and the Antient well Eſtabliſhed Government of this Realm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. That beſides all this <hi>Proof,</hi> and much more to this purpoſe, It is most No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and Evident He hath for many Years abſented from <hi>Proteſtant Churches</hi> during Religious Worſhip.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Reaſons why We believe the Duke of <hi>York</hi> to be a <hi>Papiſt.</hi>
