            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p> It is a loose Illogical Inference.

               <p>As to the succession of St. <hi>Peter, Antioch</hi> had at least as much right to challenge the first Chair in a General Council as <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <p>As to your second allegation of the <hi>Decrees of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, Popes, Fathers, giving Primacy to the</hi> Roman <hi>Church:</hi> This is specious, pompous in appearance; but is not solid, vigorous in force.</p>

               <p>I confess, the <hi>Laterane</hi> Council, under <hi>Leo</hi> the 10th, hath so establisht it; but that was in the year 1516. <note place="margin">

               <p n="2">2. In point of Theology. That Epistle relates that the Seventy Disciples were Elected by the Apostles, whereas <hi>Anacletus</hi> was a better Divine, a better Textuary than to be ignorant of the Record of St. <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 1. that the Lord appointed those Disciples.

The two other Decretal Epistles of material difference, of <hi>Anacletus</hi> and <hi>Zepherinus</hi> alledged of the same impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, are of the same, (of no) credit, concerning the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision of grand, of difficult Causes by the Apostolick See.</p>

               <p>There could be no such Decree <hi>de jure,</hi> in point of Right, there was no such <hi>de facto</hi> in point of Fact.

               <p>In the former, <hi>Constantius</hi> the <hi>Arrian</hi> Emperour being exasperated against St. <hi>Athanasius, Liberius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> cajoled him, supplicated him, that a Council might be assembled at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he offered in effect the same reason for appointing <hi>Alexandria</hi> in the Cause of St. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> that St <hi>Cyprian</hi> did in excepting against <note place="margin">Cypr. Ep. 55. Theodor. Hist. l. 2. c. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Rome</hi> in the <hi>African</hi> concerns. (Where the Party impeacht, the Accusers, Advocates, and others interested, may most fitly be convened.) This is recited in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Colloquy (as the Centurist of <hi>Magdeburg</hi> stile it) <note place="margin">Magdeb. in Cent. 4. cap. 3.</note> betwixt <hi>Constantius</hi> and <hi>Liberius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Liberius</hi> alledged no decisive Jurisdiction in himself, in the See of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The later instance is the cause of St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Sozom. l. 8. cap. 25.</note> wherein Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> the first declared a necessity of a <hi>Synodal</hi> Convention to asswage the Tempest in the Church.</p>
               <p>He asserted no Papal Oecumenical Power to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Controversies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:53576:17"/>
He approved the <hi>Milevitan</hi> Council, which prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">Innocent. in Ep. ad Mile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.

               <p>About Sixteen years after the Sixth <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Council which lasted six years, having regularly chalked out the gradations of Appeals in the <hi>African</hi> Church, absolutely debarred any to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> I have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated this point, because the <hi>Roman</hi> Champions lay so much stress upon it, and that I may not need to venti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, to sift it any more in this Tract.</p>
               <p>I have not yet examined the Proofs in the supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious Decretal Epistles of <hi>Anacletus</hi> and <hi>Zepherinus.</hi> The latter derives the Power of the Apostolick See from the Apostles and their Successors. The former from the Apostles by the Commandment of our Lord. Fallacies are enwrapped, shrowded in generalities. No injunction of Christ or any of his Apostles is recited for the Papal final deciding of difficult Controversies.</p>

                  <hi>De non existentibus &amp; de non apparentibus eadem est ratio.</hi> What is not apparent, may rationally be rejected as not existent.</p>
               <p>After these false varnishes of Antiquity, <hi>H.

He quits the Field in this quarrel with a flaunting Trophee of Victory. These were all Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> but no true Protestants I hope. This Sarcasme is more imbitter'd with Gall, than seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Salt.</p>
               <p>The Name of Protestants took its Rise in the year 1529, from the protestation of Six Princes and 14 Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <note place="margin">

               <p>The Inference of <hi>H. T.</hi> is not convincing in Logick, being deduced from an Insinuated Errour in Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.

The most exact Chronologers date the <hi>Elibertine</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil a considerable time before the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council; Twelve years before the Computation of <hi>Onuphrius,</hi> Twenty years more Ancient in the Calculation of <hi>Baronius.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This being granted, the <hi>Elibertin</hi> had the precedency of Age, it is evident, That what <hi>Hosius</hi> did less consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately solemnly ascribe to in a Provincial Council, he did more maturely Authoritatively correct in a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council.</p>

Were this Council of <hi>Arles</hi> as managed in the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, and as conveighed to us in the Records of it uncorrupted, yet it was but a Provincial Council in <hi>France,</hi> (as the <hi>Elibertine</hi> cited was in <hi>Spain)</hi> which must vail to an Oecumenical, to the first <hi>Nicene;</hi> wherein when there was an active assay of establishing a Sanction for separating the Clergy from their Wives <gap reason="foreign">

               <p> This Catholick band is a specious, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably a false Muster, wherein <hi>Ursula</hi> leads the Van to 11000 Virgins.</p>
               <p>This being strictly inspected will appear an imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Romance, not a real Transaction.</p>
               <p>There is a double proof offered, the one is Fanatical, the other fabulous.</p>
               <p>The first consists in Visions, in the Revelations of St. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> (in the <hi>Romish</hi> Style and Kalendar) and of <hi>Richardus Praemonstratensis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the grand support of the <hi>Coten</hi> Divinity, the Pageantry of its Sepulchres, so much blazed and gloried in: <hi>Ad populum phaleras.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The most circumspect, ingenuous <hi>Romanists,</hi> blush to own the Originals and the products of the vain <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasms</hi> in this Instance.</p>
               <p>The Visions presented being exactly discust, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maskt to be Dreams; the Revelations convicted, to be Collusions.</p>
               <p>The second Argument for avouching <hi>Ursula</hi> and her numerous illustrious Train is the Allegation of an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical Evidence, wherein there is no credible, no ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional account given to satisfie a judicious Inquisitor.</p>
               <p>The best Author that <hi>Baronius</hi> upon the most industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous search could light on, was <hi>Geoffry</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> (more reputably called <hi>Galsridus Asaphensis)</hi> whom all Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians that mention brand for an Impostor: <hi>Baronius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self (in other subjects) gives him no better character.</p>

               <p>There is no consent touching <hi>Ursula's</hi> Extraction, her Habitation, whether her Native Soil were <hi>England</hi> (being as it is pretended courted to be the Bride of an <hi>English</hi> Prince;) or <hi>Scotland,</hi> (according to <hi>Wicelius</hi>'s Poetry; or <hi>Ireland,</hi> according to the Vindication of <hi>Combachius.)</hi> Thus where there is no Truth, there is no Stability, no Concord.</p>

The <hi>Brittain</hi> Church did neither in the First, Second, Third, Fourth, or Fifth Century submit to the <hi>Roman,</hi> nor conform to it, not in its Liturgy; not in its Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, its Canons; not in point of Ordination of Priests, of the Prohibition of their Matrimony, not in the Observation of Easter.</p>
               <p>So little a Correspondence there was in matters Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical, betwixt them; That <hi>Gregory</hi> the First was ignorant and inquisitive (in the Testimony of <hi>Paulus Diaconus)</hi> whether the <hi>Britains</hi> were <hi>Christians</hi> or <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans.</hi>

               <p>The inserting by <hi>H.

               </p>
               <p>His Epistles First and Second to Pope <hi>Innocentius,</hi> do not derogate from this Equality. (As the <hi>Romanists</hi> object.) They declare a voluntary Respect, not a due sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</p>
               <p>In his Exigencies he made the See of <hi>Rome</hi> his San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary for Refuge, for Assistance, not his Tribunal for Sentence.</p>
               <p>His Address to Pope <hi>Innocentius,</hi> was as to an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Prelate, not as to a Supream Judge.</p>
               <p>His Devoir, Resort, his Appeal was not to a Papal, but a Synodical Determination.</p>
