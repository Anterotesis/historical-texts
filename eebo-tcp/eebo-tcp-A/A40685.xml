            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

little auditory for which it was compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and your private Chappel wherin it was delivered.

            <p>Wee begin with the Bride, and in the first place let us put it to the
<pb facs="tcp:44884:8"/>
question. What godlines is? To which quere, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall answers will be made according to mens severall affections. Aske some Fryer observant, What godlines is, and he will tel you, the wearing of ashirt of hair, girdle of hemp, fasting so often in the week, praying so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the day with such like Canonical devotions. Ask the tenacious main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer of some new up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>start opinion, what god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines is? And he will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, It is the zealous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending with limb and
<pb facs="tcp:44884:8"/>
life of such, and such strangetenets, which our fathers perchance never hard of before; yea which is worse, such a person wil presume soto confine Godlines to his opinion, as to ungodly all others who in the least particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar dissent from him. Oh, if God should have no more mercy on us, then wee have charity one to another, what would become of us? Indeed Christ tearmeth his own a little flock, <hi>Fear not little</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luk. 12. 32.</note> 
               <hi>flock.</hi> But if some mens rash and cruel censures
<pb facs="tcp:44884:9"/>
should be true, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the godly would be so little, it would not be a flock.</p>
            <p n="5">5 It is a true but sad consideration how in all ages, men with more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency of spirit have stickled about small and unimportant points then about such matters as most concern their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. So that I may say (these sorrowfull times having tuned all our tongues to military phrases) some men have lavished more powder and shot in the defence
<pb facs="tcp:44884:9"/>
of some sleight out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works which might well have been quitted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any losse to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, then in maintaing the main platform of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and making good that Castle of Gods service and their own salvation. Pride wil be found upon serious enquiry the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall cause hereof. For when men have studied many weeks, moneths or years about some addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall point in Divinity, they contend to have the same essentiall to salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because it is essentiall
<pb facs="tcp:44884:10"/>
to their reputation, least otherwise their discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be called into questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for taking so much pains in vain, and spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so much precious time about a needlesse matter. Hereupon they labour to inhance the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of their own studies, and will have all those mynes gold, which they have discovered; yea, all their superstructures must be accounted fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall: All their far fetcht deductions and consequential results must bereputed tobe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb facs="tcp:44884:10"/>
and essentiall to godlines; yea, the very life of godlines must be placed in the zealous as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting the same.</p>
            <p n="6">6 But it will be the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest way for us to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>description of godlinesse from a pen infallible, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall, and unconcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in our modern di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions. Even from Saint <hi>Iames</hi> himself. <hi>Pure</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:44884:11"/>
setteth forth the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call part of Religion, and, as I may term it, the heat of godlinesse. To which if the speculative part, the light of Godlinesse bee added, <hi>to know the only true God, and Iesus Christ whom he</hi> 
               <note place="margin">John 17. 3.</note> 
               <hi>hath sent,</hi> then godlines is made compleat. And godlinesse thus defined admits of a latitude, so that it may consist with some errours in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and infirmities in practise; Provided that the godly person persists in Faith, Hope and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which hold out the
<pb facs="tcp:44884:11"/>
summe of Religion as to the necessary part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

<pb facs="tcp:44884:25"/>
who at first were sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to <hi>Penelope</hi> the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse, but at last were married to the Maids which attended her.

love the Portion then the Person, have more minde to the gaine then the godlines.
