         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHereas there is extant a certain Scandalous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
Pamphlet, tending to encrease Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
against-the Innocent People of God called,
<hi>Quakers,</hi> (without any name or Author sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed)
wherein our late innocent Declaration is stiled, <hi>A
Seditious Libel;</hi> and our Meetings termed <hi>Seditious Conventicles;</hi>
and we accused of <hi>Dangerous Practises, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To Which we Answer, That we shall not need much to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate,
our selves herein: First, because our innocency and
clearness from these unjust charges is so manifest to our Nation
and Neighbourhood. Secondly, because this false Informer
and Accusar hath not brought forth any matter of either proof
or validity against us; and because he hath scandalized our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
as being as Seditious Libel, and so slandered us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
we may again give a hint of the nature and tendancy of
our Declaration so accused, that it is a Declaration against
all seditious Conventicles and dangerous practises of any
who under colour or pretence of tender Conscience have,
or may contrive Insurrections, this is the Title; as also in
our Declaration, the Worship of God in his Spirit and
Power, the peaceable Truth, and seeking peace with all
men, and meeting together to worship God therein, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Christ and his Apostles, is vindicated, and a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
given against all Sedition, Conspiracy, contriving In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrections;
as also it is judged gross Hypocrisie and Dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation
for any to pretend tenderness of Conscience, and a
Religious exercise, and under that colour intend a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
thing, as to contrive Insurrections, &amp;c. Concerning
which we, who are called <hi>Quakers,</hi> can say, in the presence of
God, we are free and clear from all such things in the sight of
God, Angels and Men: Thus far is signified in our Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Now let the moderate Reader judge, whether this Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of ours be seditious yea or nay, as this false <hi>Informer</hi> hath
accused it? or whether his Pamphlet and Information herein be
not absolutely seditious against the Government, and common
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58904:3"/>
good of the Nation; for herein he hath accused us of Sedition, for
our declaring against Sedition, dangerous practices, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving
Insurrections: And whether herein he hath not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
more like a Popish Emissary, then a good Subject?</p>
            <p>Whereas this Informer accuseth us, as followeth, <hi>viz</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inform.</hi> The Quakers do not exercise any part of Divine Worship,
according to the Liturgy, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Divine Worship is in the Spirit and in the Truth,
and therein we meet, we wait, we call upon God, as his People
of old did, who knew not how to pray, but as the Spirit helped
their infirmities, and this is according to the Spirit of Truth,
which the Liturgy refers and directs men to, and the Scriptures
direct us to this Spirit of Truth, to follow its guidance and
teaching; and dare this Accusar plainly affirm, that the
<hi>Liturgy,</hi> and Practice of the Church of <hi>England</hi> do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of this? has not he herein accused the Church of
<hi>England?</hi> then what Church doth he belong to? and doth
not the word <hi>Liturgy</hi> of the Church, signifie, The publick
Work, Action, or Service of the Church? and can any reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
confine it only to Reading Confessions of sins, and
Prayers? for is there not both a Prayer before Sermon, and
Preaching also used in the Church, which are not particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
recorded in the Common-Prayer-Book? Besides, this our
Accusar, though he would shew himself both a Divine and a
Lawyer, yet he is good at neither Law nor Gospel; for the
words of the Act, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>Any Assembly, Meeting, or Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
under colour or pretence of any Exercise of Religion, in
other manner then according to the Liturgy of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> &amp;c.</q> the sence hereof he tyes up to this, (saith
he) <hi>It must be according to the form and method there prescribed,
that is publick Prayer, in places set apart; there being in the
Liturgy prescribed Forms as well for private as publick Worships, &amp;c.</hi>
as if he would tell us, that the religious exercise that is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Common-Prayer, is the Common Prayer it self;
and so unless we have it read, we are hereby deemed to be under
a colour of religious exercise not according to it, which is
gross non-sence and ignorance; for that which is according to
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Liturgy is not the Liturgy it self; besides the words <hi>colour</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:58904:3"/>
or <hi>pretence</hi> of any exercise of Religion, relate to the Title and
Preamble of the Act, as not being the real manifestation of
Worship, but a Cover to carry on some contrary, design or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of Sedition or Insurrection; for the Title of the Act,
is, <hi>An Act to prevent and suppress seditious Conventicles;</hi> therefore,
not to prevent and suppress peaceable harmless Meetings, which
are really for the Worship and Service of God, in the Spirit
and Truth. The Preamble which ought to be the Key and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Law, is <hi>against the growing and dangerous practises of
Seditious. Sectaries, and other disloyal Persons, who under pretence of
tender Conscences, have, or may at their Meetings contrive Insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi>
hereby the words <hi>Colour</hi> and <hi>Pretence</hi> are sufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained;
and that it ought not to be inflicted upon people who
are really of tender Consciences towards God in their exercise
of Religion and Worship, which we being concerned in, have
not in the least, forfeited the liberty to tender Consciences so
often promised by the King, both in his Letters from <hi>Breda,</hi>
and divers Declarations since.</p>
            <p>Again, whereas this Informer accuseth us of a <hi>seditious and
blasphemous Pamphlet, published</hi> in the year 1664. without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
either any <hi>Sedition</hi> or <hi>Blasphemy</hi> in it, or shewing by
what Author, &amp;c. Let the indifferent Reader note his envy
and malice herein, and how disingeniously he hath dealt by
us.</p>
            <p>And now to prove our Practises dangerous he proceeds
thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inform.</hi> That they have been dangerous <hi>Germany</hi> hath well
experienced, by the rebellion of <hi>David George,</hi> the first of your
Sect. Such another was <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leydon,</hi> and <hi>Cobbs</hi> faction in
<hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This Informer would make the Magistrates believe
strange Stories against us, if they would be but so easily drawn to
dance at his Pipe, and do the Devils drudgery of persecution for
him, as his malicious spirit would have them; and if they were
so credulous as to believe his notorious Lyes and forgeries
against the <hi>Quakers;</hi> where he tells them of the Rebellion in
<hi>Germany,</hi> bringing it as an instance against us, though most
unjustly and impertinently: As also his calling <hi>David George
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58904:4"/>
the first of our Sect,</hi> which is a most manifest and absurd Falshood
and Abuse; for as History mentions of him, he was about the
year, 1544, and held (as recorded) very blasphemous licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
doctrines; as that he was Christ the Messiah; and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Polygamy</hi> (or the having many Wive,) to be free and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
And further (its said) Embroyled the lower parts of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>
in Tumults,<note n="*" place="margin">As in Ross his View.</note> which things both our righteous Principles
and innocent Lives do utterly testifie against.
And as for <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> who lived also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the same time, who is said to have had
his Meetings all in the night time) he is represented as one of the
same Principle, to allow of the same gross evil of <hi>Polygamy.</hi>
whose extravigancies, pride, and presumption, in his causing
Wars, and Disturbances, and assuming Kings-ship (as
recorded of him) our Religion and Example do also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
as repugnant to the very Nature and Life of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</p>
            <p>And besides, where doth History or intilligent Persons relate
that either <hi>David George, John</hi> of <hi>Leiden,</hi> or <hi>Cobs</hi> Faction, were
accounted <hi>Quakers</hi> in their time? Do but see the malice and
falshood of this Accuser and Informer, thus to render such our
Presidents, whose Example we never followed; and if he could
nominate thousands of rebellious Persons, doth it appear just
in him to endeavour the prejudicing, and instigation of the
Rulers against such as are Innocent and Peaceable, both in their
Principles and Deportments: Surely such cruel and partial In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
as this, who hath no more sence either of the common
good of the Nation, nor whats consistant with human Society,
nor yet of their Innocency whom he accuseth; but would have
People disturbed and persecuted for their Consciences, upon
his meer false suggestions, and evil surmises, would bring the
Nation to a sad pass, if they had their wicked wills, who have
neither Truth, Reason, nor hnman Pollicy, in their seeking
to blow up the Coals of Sedition, Strife, and Persecution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
their Neighbours, which is never like to compose diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
in matters of Religion and Conscience, but to make
them wider and more incomposible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inform.</hi> There is Sedition and Rebellion implyed in the Doctrine
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58904:4"/>
you teach at your Conventicles: You preach against Dignities, and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
of Honour; calling them Antichristian contrary to the Scripture,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Here is an Accusation of an implicit Sedition and
Rebellion in our Doctrine; but no proof, only a false Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
added, <hi>That we preach against Dignities,</hi> which is a gross
Slander; for both Dignities and Dominion we own, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that its Truth and Righteousness which only doth <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie</hi>
and make <hi>Worthy</hi> and honourable; it is Vertue and Wisdom
makes honorable &amp; worthy; and all Titles that are proper there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
which truly express either the Virtue, Dignity, or Worth
of Rulers, and their Dominion, we never opposed; but flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
complemental deceitful Titles, which tend but to please
men, and gratifie proud spirits, we utterly deny, as that
which our Maker would condemn us for, should we use them:
This Informer had dealt more ingeniously, had he told us what
those (he calls) Titles of Honour are, which the Scripture
commands, and which he saith, we call Antichristian.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inform.</hi> To the King belongs Obedience; you must obey his Laws,
and those either actively or passively; but you are content with nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Whatsoever is commanded by Authority, if it be not contrary
to the Word of God, must be obeyed actively, and not passively. Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Obedience is only required when things contrary to the Word of
God are commanded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is a false Accusation, That we are content with
neither; for we obey both actively and passively; Actively so
far as stands with our Peace of Conscience, in the Sight of
God, and otherwise we are passive, as our patient suffering

implied, That there may be Laws or Commands contrary to

then it follows, that whatsoever is contrary must not; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
the Word and Law of God are indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensable;
and God hath placed an equal and

neither Statute, Presciption, nor Custom ought

            <p>
               <hi>Inform.</hi> It is not necessary that all things commanded by Authority
must have a command, or president in Scripture; for many things are
left indifferent to the discretion of God's Vicegerents, as Kings, &amp;c.
A Power is likewise in the Governours of the Church, to impose such
things as they shall find necessary to be observed in the publick Worship of
God; and this we may infer from those words of the Apostle, The rest
will I set in order when I come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> To the first part, Nothing essential to the Worship
of God can truly be deemed indifferent, nor differently left to
mens discretion, for the Law of the Spirit of Life is the true
and infallible Rule to Believers in the true Worship, and mens
judgements ought to be subject thereunto; but as for this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of things <hi>indifferent</hi> in the Worship of God; it has been
an inlet to much Idolatry and Superstition amongst Apostates
and pretended Christians: However, it is a gross impiety, as
also an interfering with their own Principle, for any to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
others meerly for things which themselves deem indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
which in moderation might better be dispenced with, then
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58904:5"/>
rigorously to inforce them. To the second part, This Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
seems to set up a second sort of Governours in the Church,
besides (or above) Kings, as having power to impose things in
worship, without either Scripture or President thereof, which
is rank Popery, tending to encourage Popery, and to bege<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
People into an implicit faith, and acceptance of unwritten
Traditions, from those he counts Governours of the Church;
but herein he hath plainly opposed the Protestants high esteem
and preferment of the holy-Scriptures. And his instance of the
Apostle, <hi>The rest will I set in order when I come,</hi> will make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for his purpose, to bring dissenters under all the unscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Impositions and Ceremonies of these he calls Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of the Church: whether he means the Pope, his Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,

he means some oth<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> begged the Question, as if he took it
for granted, that conscientious Dissenters must presently, upon
his bare word, believe that these Imposers he now pleads for, are
in the same Power and Authority and Example with the Apostles
and Ministers of Christ in former dayes; but Dissenters must
have a better demonstration then this mans bare word for it, or
the Persecution and Cruelty he would instigate to, but he has
greatly erred in these matters; for the true Church had one
Head and Law-giver even Christ, and wherein the true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
and Elders thereof did give directions, either for order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
affairs or to follow them; It was not from a meer impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
nor outward force, nor yet as Lords over Gods Heritage,
neither to have dominion over their Faith, but in the unity of
the Spirit of Life, as Fellow-Helpers in Christ, and as being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
by the powerful evidence of his Spirit even in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences;
so said the Apostle, Be ye Followers of me as dear
Children, even as I am of Christ: Now such Children as
he begot into the Faith knew it their duty to follow him, as they
knew him a Follower of Christ; but this is no ground for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Pope, or his Clergy, or any that are popish in their
unwritten Traditions, to impose them, or force them upon such
as are none of their Children, for that is but a meer usurpation
at most, and but Antichristian.

our desires being that Rulers might be a terror to Evildoers,
and a praise to them that do well; for the preservation
of men in their respective Proprieties, Rights, and Liberties;
so that in our paying our Dues we have a Testimony for God,
and may with a good Conscience clame our Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as men, and ought also to have our Freedom as Christians,
whilst we give to God his Due, and to <hi>Caesar</hi> his Due, which

               <hi>Answ.</hi> This <hi>[doth belong]</hi> is a false Assertion, for those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ordinances of Divine Service under the Law, with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
Offerings, divers Washings, and many Shaddows,
which belonged to the outward Tabernacle and Temple, have
been dedicated for the Service of God in their time, which
now are ended in Christ; as the Tythes are, which were given

            <p>

wait at the Alter should live of the Alter, and they which preach the
Gospel should live of the Gospel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that whosoever refuseth to pay
Tythes to the Ministers doth not give to God the things that belong to
God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Here he grosly perverts that Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 13. 14.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58904:7"/>
rendering it as if living of the Gospel were in the same manner
of the Priests living of the Alter under the Law; whereas
at the Altar they pertook of both Tythes and Offerings, must
they therfore live upon Tythes and Offerings under the Gospel?
where is then the difference between Law and Gospel? and how
are Offerings ended under the Gospel? and a tenth part of the
Tythes of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> was to be offered up a heave-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
unto the Lord, <hi>Num.</hi> 18. 26, 27, 28, 29. But as for the words
<hi>[even so]</hi> they relate not to the manner of living of the Alter:
but to the Lord's <hi>Ordaining,</hi> as even so hath the Lord <hi>ordained,</hi> that
they that preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel, 1. <hi>or.</hi> 9. 14.
so the Gospel makes way for the true Minsters Maintenance,
which is not a forced Maintenance, neither is it Tythes or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings;
for as is fully testified in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. the Priesthood being
changed there is made of necessity a change also of the Law;
the Sons of <hi>Levy</hi> who received the Office of the Priesthood had
a Command to take Tythes of their Bretheren, but this is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
as it is said; there is a disanulling of the Commandment
going before; so this man might as well have accused the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
with failing to pay to God his Due, as have accused us in
the matter of Tythes, seeing our Testimony is one and the same:
But this <hi>Informer</hi> shews himself to have little regard to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
whilst he can plead the discretion of Magistrates and

First, implying a Worship of God in Spirit and Truth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
obedience which cannot be; for that Worship which stands

to be the greater<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> herein he hath blasphemously set up an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority

Information and Accusations against
the Quakers (by H. Thornedike, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend
of Westminster-Church, so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led)
in his Book, called, A Discourse

which a due Reformation requires.</head>

that the <hi>Souls</hi> of men went from one <hi>Body</hi> to another, &amp;c. But

he can never unchristian the <hi>Quakers;</hi> for their Christianity

Accusers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preb.</hi> For they do openly own the dictates of their own Spirit to be
as much the Word of God as the Scriptures; acknowledging the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
so far as they please.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> This is also a false Accusation, for it is not their own
spirits, but the Spirit of God which they follow the dictates
of, which agree with the holy Scriptures, by which Spirit of
God the Revelations of the Mystery of Life and Salvation in
Christ is given unto us, and we have received power, not only
to profess, but to order our conversations according to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preb.</hi> Introduce the pretences of their own Revelation where they
think fit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> This is also an evil suggestion; for it is not such
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58904:10"/>
pretences, but the Revelation of Jesus Christ in reality, that
by his Spirit is introduced amongst us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preb.</hi> For when the private spirit is equalled with Gods Word,
the last dictate, as in mens last Wills must of necessity take place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> This is also false, as it is intended against us, called
<hi>Quakers;</hi> and no less then a Popish Accusation cast upon us,
this being the very phrase of <hi>Papists</hi> against us, as calling the
Spirit of Christ by which we are led a private spirit; whereas
indeed it is the universal Spirit which convinceth the World
of sin, and leads the true Believers into all truth; and in this
universal Spirit we worship God, and have good will to all
men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preb.</hi> The <hi>Quakers</hi> follow everyone their own [spirit;] therefore
are the more contemptable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> This also is a false and contemptable Accusation cast
upon us, the same with the former; for we prefer the Spirit of
God, and its leadings, and not our own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preb.</hi> Certainly, did they see that they cannot be reconciled, but as
so many Runnagadoes, they would bethink themselves before they went
on in their madness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> Envious men are blind, and void of true Judgment, and
are ready to stumble at Noon-day; and though they have eyes,
yet cannot see; for we have received Grace, by which we are
reconciled and redeemed from folly and madness; by which
Grace we are taught to deny ungodliness, and worldly lusts,
and to live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present evil
World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preb.</hi> This their Position is not reconcileable to civil trust, alwayes
oblieging them to the most desperate acts of Treason and violence to their
Country, that they can imagine their own spirits to dictate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:58904:11"/>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> As this Position charged upon us (of following our
own private spirits) is utterly false, so are also these Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and they savour of a popish &amp; blood thirsty spirit, that would
bring Persecution and violence upon us; therefore we chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
and charge this <hi>Prebend</hi> to prove (if he can) when, and
where we were perfidious, either in matters of civil trust, or
ever brought forth acts of Treason or Violence to our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
we charge it upon him, as a most malicious and envious
instigation against us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preb.</hi> It cannot be beyond the merit of their madness, that they are
made <hi>Servi penae,</hi> by Law, as the <hi>Romans</hi> Law calls it; That is,
That they are transported to work in the Plantations—the Law is
to provide for such People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> Here is still more Railing and Instigation to Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
and Persecution: No doubt but this man, if he had
Power, or Horns long enough he would be cruel enough;
we may expect the very <hi>mercies of such</hi> to be cruelty; he
would have us made <hi>Servi penae</hi> indeed, but we desire more
competent Judges then such as he, who is not content
with our ancient <hi>English</hi> Laws already made; but would have
crueller to bring us under servitude and vassalage in Forreign
Plantations; whereas many thousands of conscientious Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters,
both Quakers and others, have estates already suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to live upon, which they have honestly laboured for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But
if this cruel Prebend's counsel might take effect against us, it
appears we must have our Estates taken from us, and then be
exiled as Slaves and Drudges: But doth he design, that he
and his Companions shall have our Estates, or part of them,
to spend upon their lust? Surely, it is obvious what misery he,
and such as are of his Gang would bring upon this Nation; a
considerable part whereof doth conscientiously dissent from
this Prebend's Way and Religion, who hath thus shewn his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate,
proud, imperious persecuting Spirit most repugnant
to the equal Law of Christ, which enjoyns him to do to all men
as he would they should do to him: Besides, what pride and
presumption is it in him to take upon him to prescribe the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58904:11"/>
Magistrates such a way and manner of proceeding against Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters,
so contrary to the wholsom fundamental Laws<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
and Rights of English men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preb.</hi> They must fail of civil trust of Subjects, that is, that their
Testimonies be not taken in Law, That they be disabled to sue at Law;
That they be disabled to make Wills, or to get by Wills; or anything else
within the effect of civil trust; And this must also be the penal<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

            <p>
               <hi>Repl.</hi> This envious Informer would have us excluded out
of all our rights at once, though without any just ground or
reason: Let but all that are unbyassed in this Nation see what
ranchor cruelty and injustice resides in this mans spirit, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan</hi>
(crooked Serpent) like, thus <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

English men of their rights and privileges, and that
without any proof or ground for his Accusations, accusing
us of failing of the civil trust of Subjects, when as we have
been found more trusty and faithful then many of his Coat,
who have temporized, crept, and changed with every Form
and change of Government, for Self-ends, Gain, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preb.</hi> For they who declare themselves as freedom to forswear the

            <p>
               <hi>Repl.</hi> Who are to be marked as Enemies to Christianity?
This man is no competent Judge, for he hath already abused
true Christians (as such like) seeking to instigate the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates,
to do his and his Brethrens Druggery of Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
against them. And when and where did we ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
our selves at freedom to forswear the Christian Faith? Is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58904:12"/>
not this an envious insinuation of thy own head and wicked
heart, to make us odious? We hope we shall have a better
tryal; end more impartial Judges, and more just Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
than this mans, before he gets us transported to work in
forreign Plantations; but it appears, all this man aims at
is the enforcing severity upon all that dissent from his Way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And what doth he think will be the effect thereof? And how
will such cruel work compose the spirits of the People of this
Nation? doth he think to make up a good Church or a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Body, by driving men with force and cruelty into his
way and worship? Surely this is not the way to make sound
Members, but to add to the number of Hypocrites; nor is this
the Way of Christianity: And where did <hi>Peter, Paul, Timothy</hi>
or <hi>Titus</hi> go about to instigate the Rulers to Persecution, and to
Transporting of men to be as Slaves and Vassals for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Conscience? Or where did any of the true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
or Apostles endeavour to exclude either <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles</hi>
from their outward civil Rights and Priviledges, or from the
benefit of the civil Law of their Nation? or endeavour and
seek to set such a Mark upon them meerly for their Principle
or difference in Judgment and Opinions? Let this Prebend
shew us a President, Precept, or Example among the true
Christians in all the Scriptures of Truth for this his work. As
for Apostacy and Athism, it is not amongst us, but among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
professed and owned as Sons of that Church he is a Member
of, who are run into a spirit of Liberty and Debauchery,
whereby the Earth is corrupted, and the beauty of much of
the Nation stained, and the profession of Christianity scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized,
and made odious in the eyes of <hi>Mahumitans,</hi> and other
Nations; but as for these things, he and his Fraternity can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive at
and overlook them, while they can contribute to uphold
them in their Pride, Idleness, and Fulness; who notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cannot therein acquiess without envying the very Being of
others more rational, prudent, and righteous then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>

Well, you that appear in this cruel persecuting, domineer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
