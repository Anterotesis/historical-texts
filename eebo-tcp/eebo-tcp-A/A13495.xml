            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18862:11"/>For where nor wit, or beauty could come in</l>
               <l>In any shape I could admittance win.</l>
               <l>I make the Husband sometimes keepe the dore,</l>
               <l>The whil'st for me) his wife doth play the whore.</l>
               <l>And many times (to moue all hell to laughter)</l>
               <l>I made a Mother Bawde vnto her daughter.</l>
               <l>I forc'd a Virgine, cast off continence</l>
               <l>And Chastity, and put on Impudence.</l>
               <l>I made a reuerend Iudge to take a Bribe,</l>
               <l>I made a Scribe a forged Name subscribe,</l>
               <l>I caus'd a Miser sell his soule to hell,</l>
               <l>Because I here on Earth with him should dwell,</l>
               <l>And eighteene yeares he kept me day and night</l>
               <l>Lock'd in a Chest, not seeing any light.</l>
               <l>And though my lot was thus a Slaue to be,</l>
               <l>Yet was he a farre worser Slaue to me;</l>
               <l>For he had vow'd himselfe to death to pine,</l>
               <l>Rather then spend one penny pot of wine,</l>
               <l>Although he late had swallow'd downe his throat,</l>
               <l>Stinking fresh Herrings threescore for a Groat.</l>
               <l>And he did bide this slauish misery,</l>
               <l>On purpose to debarre my liberty.</l>
               <l>At last this poore rich, base penurious Knaue,</l>
               <l>Was borne (the way of all flesh) to his Graue:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18862:11"/>And his braue heire, vpon his backe had got</l>

               <l>He the next day let flie the ill got treasure,</l>
               <l>And I began to see some worldly pleasure;</l>
               <l>From my old Masters Chest, I was assum'd</l>
               <l>To my young Masters Pockets, sweet perfum'd,</l>
               <l>'Ta bawdy house, of the last new translation</l>
               <l>He bare me with him, for his recreation,</l>
               <l>There for a maydenhead he plaid a game,</l>
               <l>Where eightscore more before had done the same,</l>
               <l>There did my Master <hi>Knaue,</hi> discharge the score,</l>
               <l>And went, and left me with my Mistris <hi>Whore.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>I stay'd not in her seruice long, for shee</l>
               <l>Was not two dayes before she set me free,</l>
               <l>For hauing got a <hi>Frenchified</hi> heate,</l>
               <l>She was prescrib'd a Dyet, and a sweat,</l>
               <l>She gaue me to the <hi>Surgeon,</hi> for some <hi>Lotion</hi>
               </l>
               <l>For <hi>Vnguents,</hi> and a gentle working Potion</l>
               <l>For Plaisters, and for Oyntments in a Box,</l>
               <l>And so I left my Mistris, with a <hi>Pox.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>The <hi>Surgeon</hi> me to the <hi>Physitian</hi> sent,</l>
               <l>From him I to th' <hi>Apothecaery</hi> went,</l>
               <l>But there I thought that <hi>Hell</hi> I had beene in,</l>
               <l>And all the <hi>Fiends</hi> had in his Boxes bin.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18862:12"/>For it appear'd to me that all his drugs</l>
               <l>Had got the names of the infernall Bugs:</l>
               <l>Zarzaparilla, Colloquintida,</l>
               <l>Auxungia Porci, Cassia Fistula,</l>

               <l>But soone my Master freed me from my feare,</l>
               <l>He to the Tauerne went, and left me there.</l>
               <l>And whilst I in the Vintners house remain'd,</l>
               <l>Some knowledge of my Masters state I gain'd,</l>
               <l>Let no man say that drunke, my selfe I showe,</l>
               <l>For what I speake I vnderstand and knowe.</l>
               <l>I'le shew some discommodities that waite</l>
               <l>(For the most part) on euery Vintners state.</l>
               <l>First, if a rowe of houses stand together,</l>
               <l>All of one bignesse form'd, no oddes in either,</l>
               <l>If one of them be to a Vintner let,</l>
               <l>Amongst the rest at double rent 'tis set,</l>
               <l>Next, if French Wine be twenty pounds the Tonne,</l>
               <l>But a poore penny in a quart is wonne:</l>
               <l>Besides, he sometimes in the Caske doth finde,</l>
               <l>Of Lees sixe Gallons, for a Lagge behinde.</l>
               <l>And more, when in the Celler it is laid,</l>
               <l>The Carmen, and Wine-Porters must be paid.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18862:12"/>And by misfortune if the Caske be weake,</l>
               <l>Three or foure Gallons in the ground may leake,</l>
               <l>Or taking vent, it may grow dead and flat,</l>
               <l>And then the Vintner little gets by that.</l>
               <l>And if he be a fellow of free hart,</l>
               <l>He now and then must giue a pint or quart.</l>
               <l>His Candles (night and day) are burning still</l>
               <l>Within his Seller, lest his Wines should spill:</l>
               <l>And if two Kennell-rakers chance to come</l>
               <l>To come i'th euening, they must haue a roome,</l>
               <l>And ouer one bare pint will sit and prate,</l>
               <l>And burne a Candle out (perhaps) thereat,</l>
               <l>Whilst all the Drawers must stay vp and waite</l>
               <l>Vpon these fellowes be it ne're so late.</l>
               <l>The whilst a Candle in the Kitchin wasts,</l>
               <l>Another to his end ith' Seller hasts,</l>
               <l>One with the Guests, another at the Barre,</l>
               <l>Thus for one pint, foure Candles burning are.</l>
               <l>By day light, this I haue seene some to doe,</l>
               <l>Call for a pint, a Pipe, and Candle to,</l>
               <l>By that time he hath done, 'tis quickly counted,</l>
               <l>To what large summe the Vintners gaines amounted.</l>
               <l>Besides all this, his charge is euer great,</l>
               <l>For seruants wages, cloathes, and fire, and meate;</l>
