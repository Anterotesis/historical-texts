            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A True Account of the Sad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Proteſtants in
the Palatinate.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Agree with you, that the <hi>Palatinate</hi>
is one of the beſt Countries in the World;
whoſe natural fertility and plenty is ſuch, that
there is none that recovers itſelf ſooner after a
War than it. But affairs at this time are ſuch,
that it cannot be expected that we ſhould ſee
it in that flouriſhing condition it was formerly,
when you ſaw it in your Travels. During the
War, our hopes to have our condition better'd
by the Peace that ſhou'd inſue, made us cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ſuffer, hoping to enjoy our Eſtates and
Religion as formerly, when hoſtilities ſhould
ceaſe. But our expectations proved vain,
for though the War is ended, yet the Wild
Boars are ravaging our Vineyards. But theſe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96040:3"/>
blood-thirſty Zealots for Religion, though
they differed from us in opinion, yet we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
them to dwell among us, and were uſed
kindly: for requital of which kind uſage, they
are now turning us out of our Houſes, and
Churches. Thus thoſe whom we tolerated
and protected amongſt us, are for extirpating
and depriving us of that ſhelter and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
that we afforded them; by which
means a new fire is kindled here in the <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi>
ſo that we Proteſtants are in as ill a caſe,
as the <hi>French</hi> Reformed are in <hi>France,</hi> and
worſe than you were in <hi>England</hi> under the
late King <hi>James;</hi> In this, that you had only
the ſtorm hanging over you, but this is fallen
on our heads, to the extirpating the Proteſtants,
and their Religion out of their Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and this is to make way for Popery, aad
a crew of indigent <hi>Romaniſts</hi> who ſeek but for
occaſions to profit by the ruin of ſuch of their
neighbours, that cannot adhere to them in their
ſuperſtition.</p>
            <p>With permiſſion I would here make ſome
reflections how little conſonant it is to the
Princes Secular Intereſt to countenance Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96040:3"/>
contrary to the ſaith and practice of
his predeceſſors, by which we may obſerve
that none of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> perſwaſion are to be
truſted, but they will when opportunity offers
itſelf omit nothing to propagate their Religion,
to effect which they will wade through all
difficulties, though they thereby ſacrifice the
Peace and Riches of their Country, and their
faith given; ſo inherent is perſecution to
Popery that to be a Papiſt and a Perſecutor
may be looked upon as convertible terms,
that imply the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>Theſe are thoſe who are for Damning all that
are not of their opinion, a true mark of a bad
Cauſe, that dare not truſt God to convert
Souls his way, but to aſſiſt him in his work
will uſe Fire, Faggots, Dragoons, Force, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
and all to conſtrain thoſe that differ
from them, to a complyance; but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
not that Conſcience cannot be forced, tho
the Will and Body may conſent and yield to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
compliances, yet the Conſcience will ever bear
inward teſtimony againſt all ſuch ſinful conſents,
let the impoſing be never ſo dreadful to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
for we are taught not to fear men, but
him that with the body can deſtroy the Soul
also.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:96040:4"/>
But this is the ſad State of thoſe Countries
that fall into Popiſh hands, who ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be byaſſed by a bigotted Clergy, by
whom they are influenced to become unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
to their Subjects, and inſtruments of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
the eſtabliſhed foundation both of
Church and State. Thus the Popiſh Clergy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
in a Commonwealth, what Vermine
are to the fruits of the earth, whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
and conſume, and ſo become the plague of
the Age and Country where-ever they got foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>The long experience of theſe truths
might open the eyes of Soveraigns, and let
them ſee the ſelfiſhneſs of theſe Catterpillars:
How have they devoured the Laity? and
cloathed themſelves with the fatteſt, and faireſt
of their effects. How many Families have been
impoveriſhed to inrich Monaſteries and Abbeys,
and Religious Societies, who are ſo many Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
of Pride and Idleneſs; ſo that that moſt nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
part of the Subjects are become the moſt
uſeleſs members of the Commonwealth where
they reſide.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:96040:4"/>
It were to be wiſhed, that Princes in this
Age, as in the times of Reformation, knew
their Intereſt ſo effectually, as to baniſh that
Vermine, and as in <hi>England</hi> convert thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
to better uſes; this is it that hath made
your Iſland ſo powerful and wealthy, as it is at
this day, as alſo other Countries and places where
Church Lands are poſſeſſed by the Laity,
whereas in Popiſh Countries the Clergy poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes
one half, in ſome three parts, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
more; which revenues, if otherwiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of as in Proteſtant Countries, the Prince
and People would be proportionably rich ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the reſt of their reformed neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
But our Prince, not content to find a
Country lately fallen to him by inheritance,
diſpoſed ſo advantagiouſly for his intereſt by
the conſtitution of its government, but he muſt
bring in innovations, and not ſatisfied to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
ſuch a Principality as his Predeceſſors left
him, but he muſt act ſo prejudicially to his
own intereſt, and the ruin of his Subjects, by
ſettling his Religion at the coſt of what is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the right owners. It was not ſo with
<hi>Charles Louis,</hi> the former Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> who
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96040:5"/>
though a Proteſtant, would not ſuffer the
Proteſtant Miniſters, nor indeed any other
of the different perſwaſions to inveigh one
againſt another, altho it might be expected
that this our Prince might have retained a
tincture of ſuch Principles, more eſpecially being
deſcended from a Proteſtant off-ſpring. But this
conſideration hard for the Romiſh party is this
day required with ingratitude. Would to God
that our Prince would but make reflection on
the advantage and benefits that did accrues to
the Son of that Prince, <hi>viz. Charles</hi> the laſt
Proteſtant Elector <hi>Palatine.</hi> He found the
Country in a flouriſhing condition, with a great
Treaſure in Monies, all which were marks of
his Fathers prudence, by which means he was
enabled to ſupport his Countrey, and protect
thoſe of different perſwaſions, that flocked to
him from all parts, as they uſe to do as ſoon
as a peace is eſtabliſhed, by which means his
Country was repleniſhed with inhabitants,
which ſo long a War had unpeopled, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſuitable priviledges granted them were
thereby incouraged to be Inhabitants, and to
increaſe Trade.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:96040:5"/>
Thus the <hi>Palatinate</hi> was repleniſhed with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
the ruined Cities rebuilt, and new
ones erected, as <hi>Manheim</hi> and <hi>Fredericksbourg:</hi>
this effect had Toleration and that in a ſhort
time, for the Proteſtants had that incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that their Religion was the Religion
of the Country, and others were drawn thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by their being tolerated and countenanced
by publick Authority, where all finding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
were incouraged to Trade and gather
riches, ſince they were aſſured to dwell quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the profeſſion of their different perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>But what incouragements is there now to
live here, where promiſes are violated? The
Natives that have been frighted from their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations,
and ſcattered into other Countries
by the War, dare not now return, ſeeing our
Prince is for introducing Popery and its profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
who being leſs numerous and rich than the
Proteſtants, the end of repeopling, and reinſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Country in its former glory cannot be
expected, for they ſhew to have nothing in view
but the violating the rights and properties of
the Proteſtants, as will appear by this following
Narrative.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:96040:6"/>
At <hi>Heidelberg</hi> and <hi>Manheim</hi> they have built
very much, ſince his Electoral Highneſs
hath publiſhed a Proclamation, wherein he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
a freedom of thirty years, and aſſures
them that their priviledges ſhall not be altered,
but that he will maintain them all, which did
incourage us to carry on our buildings, ſo that
the work advanced very much; but having
ſince iſſued out another Proclamation, by
which the Popiſh Holy days are injoin'd to be
kept through the whole <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and that
the Proteſtant burying places ſhall be common,
our Buildings are at a ſtand, and we ſee the Romiſh
Religion introduced by Authority, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
in our Churches through the whole <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate.</hi>
Alſo his Electoral Highneſs has taken
from us the ſeven Latin Schools, with the
Cloyſter and Church at <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> where they
are erecting Cloyſters for the <hi>Franciſcans, Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins,</hi>
and <hi>Capuchins,</hi> with a Seminary for the
<hi>Jeſuits;</hi> and are very buſy to get into their
poſſeſſion the Holy Ghoſt or Cathedral Church,
as alſo the <hi>Collegium Sapientiae</hi> As they have
done with the Cathedral Churches at <hi>Wein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heim</hi>
and <hi>Ladenburg</hi> and other places, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96040:6"/>
has taken from the Eccleſiaſtical Council, and
the <hi>Verwaltung</hi> their ancient priviledges and
rights, and the revenues, Liberties and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and the Freedom of diſpoſing of their
Eccleſiaſtical Incomes, ſo that the Lands which
belong to the Miniſters and the Tythes, which
make a part of their Salary, are given to the
Roman Catholicks, which proceedings have
caſt us into ſo great aconſternation, that we have
loſt all courage, even our deſires are cooled
from going on with our Buildings.</p>
            <p>When his Electoral Highneſs came into the
<hi>Palatinate,</hi> and choſe the Caſtle of <hi>Weinheim</hi> for
his reſidence, he then promiſed, and aſſured
both Laity and Clergy, that he would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
all their priviledges, but we find theſe were
but Popiſh promiſes, which do afflict us very
much, and the more in that his Electoral
Highneſs refuſes to fill up the vacancies in the
Eccleſiaſtical Council, which conſiſts at preſent
but of two perſons, whereas their number
ought to be ſix, and a Preſident. It is
true he promiſes to allow the Proteſtant Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
ſomething out of their income for their
Subſiſtance, but without doubt, it will be little
enough.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:96040:7"/>
At <hi>Creutznach</hi> the Church that ſtands upon
the <hi>Egg Market,</hi> they converted to their own
uſe with the Latin Schools, which were thirty
year ſince built at the Proteſtants coſt, and were
endowed with a Subſiſtance for their Miniſters
and Schoolmaſters, out of the Carmelites re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues,
that was ſecularized by the Treaty of
Peace made at <hi>Munſter,</hi> which income they
injoyed ever ſince before the troubles in <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi>
to this time. They detain likewiſe a Fund
of a 1000 Rix-dollars made by the Proteſtants
and with it alſo the intereſt of the principal,
borrowed of the poors Stock, all which they
imploy to pay Popiſh School-maſters, and for
Popiſh uſes.</p>
            <p>It is alſo forbidden upon pain of Death to
expound the 80th queſtion in the <hi>Palatine</hi>
Catechiſm, which treats of the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Lords Supper and the Popiſh Maſs.
At <hi>Hackenheim</hi> three quarters of an hour
from <hi>Creutznach,</hi> a Roman Prieſt went into the
Proteſtant Church, and did not only pull the
Miniſter out of the Pulpit, where he was
preaching, but beat him out of the Church
alſo, and he, and thoſe that were with him
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96040:7"/>
handled moſt barbarouſly, thoſe of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
who being wounded, were obliged
to go out of the Church, to have their wounds
dreſſed. About a <hi>German</hi> mile from <hi>Creutznach</hi>
a Roman Prieſt ſet on thoſe who were with
him to kill a Proteſtant Barber, becauſe ſaid
he, he is a Proteſtant Dog to effect which they
knocked him down with their clubs, tho the
poor man begged upon his Knees for mercy, and
his Life, they would not grant it, but while
the wretch was crawling on the ground, they
ſhot him thro the head with ſmall ſhot. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandng
all this the Murderers go free, nor do
the Magiſtrates take any notice of it; tho he
has left a poor Widow with five ſmall Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
who can obtain no juſtice, which ſeems
as if the Magiſtrates approved this inhuman
murther, ſeeing thoſe who committed this Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
were no ſtrangers, but the Barbers neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and very well known.</p>
            <p>All the Houſes that belong to Proteſtant
Alms, and Hoſpitals are taken away by force,
with thoſe belonging to Proteſtant Miniſters
and School-maſters, whom they moleſt and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
in the executing of their functions, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96040:8"/>
them to deliver up their Schools and
Houſes, to be employed for Popiſh uſes. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will they grant that the Proteſtant Clergy
be any longer under the Eccleſiaſtical Council,
but will have them wholly to depend, and be
govern'd by the Elector's Secular Officers.
When one of the Parents is a <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,
there the Children are compelled to
embrace the Popiſh Religion, though it be both
againſt the Parents and the Childrens will;
neither are Miniſters permitted to admit any of
them to be brought up in their Religion, upon
pain of Impriſonment, and 50 Rixdollars fine,
nor will they ſuffer any <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick to
turn Proteſtant. And when the Proteſtants
with all ſubmiſſion make complaints, humbly
repreſenting how all theſe proceedings tend to
their ruin, and demonſtrate how it is againſt
the Peace of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and thoſe articles of
Agreement that were made, they anſwer, and
publiſh abroad, that that the Eccleſiaſtical
Councils orders are againſt the Elector's and
Country's intereſt, and tend to Rebellion, and
that they aſſume a Deſpotick power againſt the
Government, which tends to Sedition. Alſo
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96040:8"/>
that the Proteſtant Miniſters were Seditious
Rebels, Diſturbers of the Peace, and as ſuch
they Impriſon them, thinking thereby to
ſtrike terror into others. To remedy which,
tho complaints be never ſo ſubmiſſively made
of theſe their Grievances, repreſenting alſo, that
through theſe Miniſters confinement, people
are deprived of their Teachers, and Divine
Service is obſtructed, yet they are ſo far from
working any good effect, by appeaſing theſe
Incendiaries, that it animates them rather to
proceed to make them more uneaſie, by quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
on them numbers of the Electors
Troops, who uſe them cruelly, living in their
houſes after a Military manner. And when
ſome of the Pariſhioners by their Superiours
complain againſt ſuch proceedings, and crave
Relief in favour of their Miniſters, they fall
on them in a cruel manner, beating them in
ſuch ſort that they are often taken for dead
out of their hands: Neither does their inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
end here, but bloody and wounded as
they left them, they throw them into Priſons,
where they run the hazard of periſhing.
Moreover, they ſend to quarter upon thoſe.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96040:9"/>
Complainants Dragoons, who break their
Doors and Windows making forcible En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
then turn their Wives and Children out
of doors. Theſe crying evils induce the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectors
to make complaints to the Deputy
Lieutenants againſt thoſe barbarous proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
but they receive no other anſwer, but
that the Miniſters were Rebels, and therefore
they ought not to meddle or concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for them, leſt they incur themſelves
his Electoral Highneſſes diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>When the poor people, taking the part of
their innocent Miniſters, complain to a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Court, of theſe barbarous proceedings,
humbly begging a remedy to theſe grievances,
they receive fair promiſes, but never ſee the
effects thereof. Thus the ſuffering party re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
no relief, and the oppreſſors are unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.
But what elſe can be expected, when
all the places of truſt are put in Popiſh hands,
and the Proteſtant Natives, though better
qualified, are not regarded. This is the ſad
condition of our Country at this time, our
troubles have ſo dejected our countenances
that death and paleneſs ſeem painted there. The
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96040:9"/>
thoughts of our ſorrows are our companions
night and day, our bodies are bowed down,
and our ſpirits ſunk with grief, ſo that it ſeems
as if we had no more life left than to ſerve us
to cry unto God for help. I wiſh all good
Chriſtians would joyn with us in this good
work.</p>
            <p>Certainly our Prince muſt be our great
enemy, for elſe he could never have conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the oppreſſions here mentioned, and ſure
no body wou'd have condemned him, for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Country in <hi>ſtatu quo</hi> as he found
it, and is obliged thereto according to the
conſtitutions of the Empire, and the ſolemn
aſſurances given by this Electors Father, to
<hi>Charles,</hi> the laſt Proteſtant Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi>
when he named him his Succeſſor, that there
ſhould be no alterations made in Religion.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SInce my laſt the Elector Palatine has pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
a Declaration for <hi>Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
in the Palatinate, which is mightily cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up by the Papiſts, as an act of the great
moderation of that Prince. The Title indeed
is very ſpecious, and may impoſe upon ſuch
who are not acquainted with our Conſtitution;
but thoſe who are not altogether ſtrangers to
it, muſt needs be convinced, that this very
Declaration is a moſt manifeſt Infraction of
the Treaties of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> and calculated for
the extirpation of the Proteſtant Religion.
This puts me in mind of the Declaration of
your late King <hi>James,</hi> who, under the ſame
ſpecious Title, aim'd at the deſtruction both
of your Liberty and Religion. Our Prince is
as much a Bigot to <hi>Rome,</hi> as your abdicated
King, and as much rul'd by his Father <hi>Peters,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:96040:10"/>
and therefore we might reaſonably ſuppoſe
that he has the ſame deſigns in view, altho
we ſhould, nor have yet any Fact to convince
us of his Intentions.</p>
            <p>You know that by the Treaties of <hi>Weſtpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>
the Popiſh Religion could not be exerciſed
in the Palatinate, unleſs it was by a toleration
of the Government, to which the Proteſtant
Princes ſeem but too much inclin'd. All the
Churches, Schools, Church Lands, Tythes,
and other Eccleſiaſtical Revenues were in the
hands of Proteſtants, but by this Declaration
the Churches are to ſerve equally for the uſe
of Papiſts and Proteſtants; ſo that this is as
much a violation of our Rights, as it would
have been of yours, if the late King <hi>James</hi>
had caus'd Maſs to be ſung in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>
Abbey; for the Papiſts have no better title to
our Churches than they have to yours</p>
            <p>Had his Electoral Highneſs been contented
to give the Papiſts leave to exerciſe openly
their Religion, and even to build Churches
for themſelves, we might be ſilent, tho this
would be againſt our Privileges; but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to give 'em our Churches and our Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96040:11"/>
Incomes, under pretence of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Conſcience, is ſuch an injuſtice, that I
muſt return again to your late King, to find
any parallel to match it.</p>
            <p>I have told you in my former how they
have taken away our Schools and Colledges,
and given the ſame to Popiſh Prieſts, tho ſome
of them were ſo lately founded and endowed,
that they could not have impudence enough
to pretend that they did formerly belong to
the Papiſts; I muſt now give you ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
to ſhew the effects of this Liberty of
Conſcience, and how it is obſerved.</p>
            <p>The Elector has taken away all the Tythes
and other Incomes for the maintenance of our
Clergy, and beſtowed the ſame upon <hi>Romiſh</hi>
Prieſts; but to give ſome compenſation to the
Proteſtant Clergy, he is graciouſly pleaſed
yearly to allow each Miniſter one hundred
Guilders, which is hardly 15 <hi>l.</hi> ſterling, 20
Sacks of Corn, and one <hi>Fudder</hi> of Wine.
This ſubſiſtence being ſo ſmall that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for them to ſubſiſt upon it, no doubt but
they expect that the ſaid Miniſters will quit
their employment for want of a livelihood,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96040:11"/>
and that the Flock being left without a Shepherd
will be either diſperſed, or eaſily ſeduced.
A rare and precious Liberty of Conſcience,
which deſerveth our immortal thanks!</p>
            <p>The very ſound of the title of a Declaration
for Liberty of Conſcience, muſt needs deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
any impartial man to believe, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
his Electoral Highneſs intends that all his
Subjects ſhall have an entire liberty to embrace
and profeſs what Religion they pleaſe, at leaſt
of the three that are tolerated in the Empire,
as it is therein <hi>verbatim</hi> expreſſed; but it is
not to be wonder'd at, that ſuch who pretend
that we muſt not hearken to the evidence of
our Senſes and Reaſon, ſhould pretend to
change the genuine ſignification of words, as
you may ſee in the following particulars.</p>
            <p>A certain woman of <hi>Sekenheim,</hi> near <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh,</hi>
married to a Papiſt Husband, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
however brought up in the Proteſtant
Religion her Daughter, deſired the Miniſter
of the place to admit her to the participation
of the Lords Supper, being in the age requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the diſcipline of our Churches, which
the Miniſter did without any manner of ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96040:12"/>
This proceeding was doubtleſs very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
and juſtifiable by all divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Laws, but it has ſeemed ſo great a crime
to the Papiſts, that the poor Miniſter was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up, committed cloſe Priſoner, and fined
200 Florins. Would any man think after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
that we enjoy a free Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p>An Inhabitant of <hi>Wiſelock,</hi> a Papiſt by birth
and profeſſion, but a more honeſt man than
the generality of his perſwaſion, marry'd ſome
time time ago a Proteſtant Wife, and it was
agreed and covenanted between them, that
the Children ſhould be Chriſtned, and brought
up in the Proteſtant Religion. His Wife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brought to be of a male child, he, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his promiſe, got him Chriſtened
by the Proteſtant Miniſter of his Pariſh; which
ſo incens'd the Popiſh Clergy, that they got
an order to carry him to <hi>Heidelbergh,</hi> where
he has been kept cloſe Priſoner, and very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
uſed, and forc'd to pay a fine of 50
Florins to come out.</p>
            <p>I could bring you a hundred inſtances more
of the like nature, and of perſons now in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96040:12"/>
for having again embraced the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Religion, which they had been forc'd
to feign to quit, by the violent Perſecutions
of the <hi>French;</hi> but I am afraid to tire your
patience, and therefore I come now to the
concluſion of my Letter, wherein I beg leave
to examine in few words the pretence of theſe
violent Perſecutions, to ſhew that it is the
moſt groundleſs and unjuſt that ever was.</p>
            <p>The firſt pretence, and which was at firſt
mightily inſiſted upon, is the fourth Article
of the Treaty of <hi>Reſwick,</hi> which was chiefly
the work of the Baron <hi>de Zeiler,</hi> a famous
Renegado, in conjunction with the Miniſters
of <hi>France.</hi> But notwithſtanding what they
may ſay, that Clauſe can never juſtifie the
violent proceedings of his Electoral Highneſs;
for, taking that Article in the largeſt ſenſe
that can poſſibly be given to it, it implys no
more, but that the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks ſhould
remain in the poſſeſſion of thoſe Privileges
they were poſſeſſed of at the concluſion of
the Peace, in thoſe Countries which were to
be reſtor'd by the <hi>French</hi> to the Empire. Now
the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> I mean that part which lies
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96040:13"/>
on the Right ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> being not
then in the poſſeſſion of the <hi>French</hi> and ſome
part of it having never been in their hands,
it is plain that the ſo much ſpoken of Clauſe
cannot juſtifie any ways the innovations lately
made in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> which conſequently
are an infraction of the Treaty of <hi>Munſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is the Treaty of <hi>Reſwick</hi> more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly
obſerved than the former, when it
ſeems to favour us; for that very fourth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
which ſerves to excuſe their Perſecution
on this ſide the <hi>Rhine,</hi> is openly violated on
the other ſide of the River, where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
would be contented to enjoy the ſame
Liberty they had under the <hi>French,</hi> and which
was ſecured to them by the fourth Article of
the Peace. Sure this is the moſt unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
thing I ever heard of, and which would
put to the bluſh any man but a Papiſt. The
Proteſtants muſt be deprived of their Liberty
about <hi>Heidelbergh</hi> by virtue of a Clauſe in the
Treaty of Peace, which ought to have no
force in theſe parts, by the reaſons aforeſaid,
and they cannot enjoy their Liberty on the
other ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> notwithſtanding
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96040:13"/>
that Article ſecures it unto them. Who
wou'd have thought that the Jeſuits of
<hi>Duſſeldorp</hi> cou'd exceed in Wit or Malice thoſe
of <hi>France?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> King has not as yet openly vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
the late Treaty of Peace in matters of
Religion, for the Proteſtants in <hi>Strasburgh,</hi>
and elſewhere in <hi>Alſace,</hi> have the ſame liberty
that they had during the War; but our caſe
is very different, as I have already told you,
and it ſeems our Prince's Zeal is above that
of the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>
            <p>Having given you an account of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
and confuted the groundleſs juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
thereof, I muſt acquaint you with
the meaſures we have taken in this ſad juncture.</p>
            <p>We applied our ſelves firſt of all to his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectoral
Highneſs, as it was our duty, and
humbly repreſented the violent proceedings of
his Officers againſt us, praying the redreſs of
theſe grievances Our repreſentation was as
ſubmiſſive and reſpectful as could be, but
however we could obtain no Juſtice, and our
Deputies were ſo brow-beaten and threatned
that they did not think ſafe to inſiſt any lonegr,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96040:14"/>
for an anſwer, and returned home without
any ſucceſs. Seeing therefore that the ears of
our Prince were ſhut up againſt our juſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
we applied ourſelves to ſeveral <hi>German</hi>
Princes of our perſwaſion, and deſir'd that
they would be pleaſed to intercede for us,
and move at the Dyet of the Empire, that
the Innovations made in the <hi>Palatinate</hi> might
be conſidered. They granted our Requeſt,
and accordingly a Memorial was delivered at
<hi>Ratisbonne</hi> to the Deputies of the Catholick
Princes, containing that the proceedings of
the Elector Palatinate were a manifeſt infracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Treaty of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and that they
might prove ſo fatal to the tranquility of the
Empire, that it was highly neceſſary to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into that affair, and put a ſtop to theſe
innovations. This Memorial was communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to the Deputy of the Elector, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
time to ſend it to his Maſter, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to return an anſwer with all convenient
ſpeed.</p>
            <p>It was ſent accordingly to <hi>Duſſeldorp,</hi> and
examined by the Council of his Electoral
Highneſs; wherein it was reſolved, that the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96040:14"/>
Miniſter of the Elector ſhould give no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
anſwer to that Memorial, but only tell
the Dyet in general terms, that his Electoral
Highneſs was ſurprized that his Subjects
ſhould preſume to make ſuch groundleſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints;
that they could proceed but from a
Spirit of Rebellion, and that therefore he
would watch more narrowly their actions,
and puniſh them according to their demerits,
praying the Dyet not to concern themſelves
in this affair.</p>
            <p>Could you, Sir, have expected ſuch an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
from a Prince, who owes ſo much to
the Proteſtants, and who would have been
at this day a Titular Elector had not the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Princes reſtor'd him to his Electorate?
This is a piece of gratitude not to be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd,
which ſheweth the true character of a
Papiſt, and their helliſh deſigns againſt our
Religion. This I think ſufficient, Sir, to give
you a true Idea of our ſad caſe, which may
ſerve as a warning to all Proteſtants never to
truſt a Popiſh Prince, for impoſe upon 'em as
many oaths as you pleaſe, bind them by their
Intereſt, theſe precautions will ſerve for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96040:15"/>
at all, the Pope will abſolve them from
their Oaths, and the Jeſuits will ſo bewitch
them, as to make them act quite contrary
to their Honour and intereſt. Happy, and
thrice happy <hi>England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> to be free from ſuch
Biggotted Princes; and that you may be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
