            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IN all contracts, especially of so publique nature,
there are two principall qualities thought most
considerable, Iustice and Profit: For actions
vniust want the blessing of God: and vnconcionable
dammage drawes on the complaints and murmures
of men.</p>
            <p>The former Contract for <hi>Tobacco,</hi> hauing ben dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
by the Lords, as not being beneficiall to the
Plantations: it was hoped and expected that a new
Contract to succeede in planting thereof, should
haue reiected the former errors, and ben wholly bent
to the comfort of the now languishing <hi>Colonyes:</hi> But
the same hauing ben taken into the carefull conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of sundry persons, well willer to the plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and many factions now partially affected, who
neither had any hand as furthering the former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract;
nor came with any preiudice against this latter
when it was first broached. It hath appeared vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
so full of all kinds of vniustice both to the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers
and planters, and so bent to the certaine and


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:5317:3"/>
suddaine ruine of the plantations, that they haue
thought themselues bound both in dutie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
to deliuer these Reasons insuing against it.</p>
            <p>
               <list>
                  <head>The new Contract therefore, as it hath ben deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered

               <p>It seemeth very hard that these <hi>Colonies</hi> in this
their Infancie, should haue worse conditions im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
vpon them for their Marchandize, then any
other to our knowledge in the world, for their


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:5317:3"/>
goods being their owne, and they borne for subiects
they shall be commaunded to bring all into this
port of <hi>London,</hi> and yet not certaine to vent the
one moyitie of their Marchandize. For, the <hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes,</hi>
if they stand and prosper, cannot make so little
as 400000. weight a yeare; and these Contractors
will take off onely 200000. Againe, for the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Adventurers and Planters, there shall no man
be certaine to haue any taken off, some onely the
Contractors particular friends; which the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
having libertie to choose &amp; refuse what they
list, there is an open gate for all parts of partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in that kind. The Contractors and their freinds
making great quantities. Then for those great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
of <hi>Tobacco</hi> which shall be refused, what shall
become of them? They must be sent into <hi>Turkey:</hi>
new Marchants must be sought; disgraced were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
them; losse by long keeping and shrinking;
double charge by new fraught, that the poore pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Adventurer were much better to giue it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
in the plantatioe, then here after so great charge
to sell it for a little or nothing.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Touching the price of two shillings 4 pence
for the best sort, and 16. pence for the rest: it is
to be knowne and considred, that of long time by
agreement betweene the Companies and Colonyes,
the <hi>Tobacco</hi> in <hi>Virginia</hi> it selfe, is valued at 3 shillings
the pound, and in <hi>Summer Ilands at</hi> 2 shillings sixe
pence: which price they planters there refusing to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
and the Adventurers and Marchants here not
able to giue, hath occasioned the selling of wares vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them at double and treeble their values, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:5317:4"/>
their no money, but paying for all in <hi>Tobacco.</hi>
See then in what state this contract doth place them.
Their <hi>Tobacco</hi> must now be all made into roule, to
the greater wast of the commoditie, and greater
charge and labour of the planter aud maker, whereas
leafe <hi>Tobacco</hi> in Forraine parts doth sell much better,
being made thus, it is all to be brought to the port of
<hi>London,</hi> and so into the custome house, where it must
abide the Contracters pleasure and leasure, what &amp;
whose they will take, and what and whose they will
leaue: the charge of fraught and shrinking, cannot
be valued at lesse then 4 pence the pound: so the
cleere price commeth of the best to 2 shillings and
12. pence the rest. Now experience hath shewed,
that in every yeares returnes of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> there hath
been some few Countries that haue farre exceeded
the rest in goodnes, these then must be taken for <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baccoes</hi>
of the best sort, and paid for at the best price,
and all the rest being aboue 20. times as much in
quantitie, and not attaining to the goodnes of the
former, must necessarily in right and truth be made
<hi>Tobacco</hi> of the other sort, and consequently rated at
the lower price, the Contracts stiftnes refusing to
haue more then two sorts. In conclusion the Adven<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turer
and planter, can by this contract expect little
more then 12. pence the pound for his <hi>Tobacco.</hi> And
this at the best hand, for so much as the contracters
shall be pleased to take off: for, as for the remaines
refused, which must goe into <hi>Turkey,</hi> if he gets 4. the
pound, hee may thinke himselfe well dealt with by
those that need to giue no maner then the list, And
for this 12. pence: it shall be paid, one third part in


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:5317:4"/>
hand, and the other two thirds, at 6 and 6 moneths.
And this being the maine substance of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tract,
it cannot but be apparent vnto all men of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in the affaires of the plantations, that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers
and Planters, shall not sell their <hi>Tobacco</hi> for
one halfe of that which it standeth them in. For as
for trusting to the hope of that clause in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
that after two yeares, if their be profit, the
price shall be raysed to 2. shillings and 3. shillings,
that comfort is small, the time being long, the hope
vncertaine; and even that price being too little to
make them sauers. And thus much touching the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
estates of the Adventurers and planters wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they are to be placed by this new contract.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But now thirdly to come to the generall Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
themselues, and to enter into consideration,
whether by vertue of this Contract they are likely to
subsist and prosper: It is here first to be considered,
that the plantations having been founded vnder his
Maiesties gracious amity, at the excessiue great char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the Adventurers and planters, and so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
for many yeares, with small or no retribution
except to some few persons: and the atempts of
setting vp Staple commodities, as Iron, Silke, wines
&amp;c. though persued with great constancie, care and
charge, haue hetherto failed by sundry misaccidents.
To thinke the bestowing now of 5000. pounds a
yeare vpon the plantations, and that drawne from
the labours, and as it were, from the blood of the
planters, will raise them vp from that great decay,
into which during the space of those latter two years
they haue apparently fallen; is like to proue a great


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:5317:5"/>
and dangerous error, whereas the only meanes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
to advance the plantations, was the incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
of the Adventurers thether, especially in
person, with hope of wealth, good government and
Iustice. Experience hauing shewed that after the
publique stocke was vtterly exhaust, and the <hi>Lotte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
ended,</hi> yet the plantation in <hi>Virginia</hi> did excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
increase by the multitude of Families, and
other particular persons, transported thether at their
owne charge, vpon the a foresaid hopes and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements,
till the fatall blow of the Massacrie given
those a broad, and the great molestations and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartnings
of the company and Adventurers heere
at home, cast the Collony into that consideration
in which now it languisheth. But whensoever it
shall please his gracious Maiestie, to reviue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newe
the former hopes and incouragements, it will
no doubt restore the former life to the plantation;
the remaines whereof this contract must needes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish,
which is thus to be demonstrated. The
onely commoditie for Marchants in both the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations:
is at this day no other then <hi>Tobacco,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
their apparell, tooles, implements, and all other
necessaries (except victuall) are procured, there are
at this day in both the Colonies, at the least 3000.
persons. This allowance of 200000. weight to both
the Plantations, commeth but to 65. pound weight
of <hi>Tobacco</hi> the person, which at 12. the pound weight,
cometh to 3. pound 5. shillings, out of which all the
planters in the <hi>Sommer Ilands,</hi> and such as are Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
or Servants in <hi>Virginia,</hi> pay halfe to their
owners, whether Land-lords or Masters: so that to


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:5317:5"/>
themselues their remaines for their maintenance,
only 32 shillings 6 pence the peece. The charge of
transporting a person to <hi>Virginia,</hi> cannot be lesse at
this day then 20 pounds, which being a thing so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
knowne, must needes disharten all future
planters from going, and force the present Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
rather to send for their seruants home, then to
mainteyne them at a parpetuall charge without hope
of profit. And this hath diuers of them already o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
declared, we conclude therefore that to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that the bestowing of 5000. pound a yeare
vpon the Colonies, and that drawne from the hard
labours of the poore planters themselues will vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the plantations, when they shall find that they
can be no longer masters of their owne goods, but
must be forced to transport them, when they cannot
vent them, to put them into their hands, who shall
take and refuse what themselues please, and sell them
before their faces, perhaps at a Noble a pound, and
giue them but 6 pence after a yeares attendance for
their goods, with the fraught and all other charges
and losses: &amp; this example also in <hi>Tobacco</hi> ingendring
a feare of the like measure in all other commodities
whensoeuer they should be raysed. That wee say as
before in our vnderstanding to be a very great error,
and of pernitious consequence to hoth the plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
No lesse then to draw 40 ounces of blod from a
tender weake Infant, and then to make him a restora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
out of fiue ounces of the same blood.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now in the last place, seeing this contract is
so much magnified as tending to the great and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
good of the plantations, wee will take a little


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:5317:6"/>
paines to make inquirie by way of reasons for whose
benefite in truth, it hath been set on foote.</p>
               <p>By force of this Contract, and by vertue of his
Maiesties Proclamation, getting into their handes
the sole sale of all <hi>Tobacco</hi> to be expended either in
this vertue, or the kingdome of <hi>Irelad.</hi> It is not to
be thought but they will advance the price (after the
nature of all Monopolies) at least to as high a rate
as it hath borne in former times, that is to 8 or 9.
shillings the pound; but admit they will begin first
with a Noble a pound, two hundred thousand No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
commeth vnto sixtie six thousand, six hundred
sixtie six pounds 13 shillings 4. pence. His Maiesties
rent out of the plantations commeth vnto 15. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pounds: the planters and the Adventurers
part after the rate of 18. pence the pound, which in
probabilitie is like to be the highest medium com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
vnto 15000. pounds. So the charge in the
whole comming vnto 30000 pound. Thereis 36000
pound, and one thousand markes remayning to
themselues in way of retribution for their paines &amp;
adventure; and as themselues say to appease all such
stormes as may arise. To great a proportion to be
drawne from the plantations, to allow them scarce a
sixt part of their owne, and to bestowe almost foure
six parts vpon men no better deseruing. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Contract, what clamor and complaint against
25000. pounds to haue ben raised for Saleries, and
all other charges, which came to little more then a
pennie vpon the pound? Whereas these men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
that under 12 pence a pound gotten at least,
they would not medle with it, and they hoped for


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:5317:6"/>
farre more. By computation of the former contract
there was to come 60000 pounds at least, to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
of the plantations; whereof the 4 part is now
is thought a sufficient portion, and yet that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
was said to be pernitious to the Colonies, and
this beneficiall. Indeed to doe equall right vnto
both, the contract is better then the former, in that
it excludeth all forraine <hi>Tobacco</hi> which with great
violence was pressed vpon the former for the first
two yeares; but this is to be attribued to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
great grace, giving a favorable eare to the sute
of the Commons in Parliament, as appeareth in his
Majesties late proclamation. In the debating of the
former Contract it was alleadged against it, by such
as are now great furtherers of this, that though
the planters <hi>Tobacco</hi> were sold at 5 shillings the pound
yet by reason of his Maiesties third, they should be
loosers; and now 16 pence a pound is thought price
sufficient. This excessiue gaine of the contracters &amp;
vndertakers, we conceiue vndoubtedly to be a thing
vniust, and tending to the immediate destruction of
the plantations, for whatsoever they get the planter
looseth, and where the planter looseth, the <hi>Colony</hi> is
so much impouerished: For whatsoever the planter
makes, that goes all backe to the plantation againe,
and what the contracter gets, it remaineth with him
to his owne inriching. For, as for the returning of
5000. pounds to the plantations which this heavie
contract adnexed; It is in truth to send one hundred
men thether, and to stay thousands from thence.

               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:5317:7"/>
               <head>5. Some things we are forced to adde touching
the proceeding of this Contract.</head>
               <p n="1">1 First, whereas the Adventurers of the <hi>Sommer
Ilands</hi> remaine still a Company, and are restrained
by their Letters Pattents from ordering of matters
of Trade but in a Quarter Court: This Contract
hath been sought to haue ben concluded, in a meane
and extraordinary meeting, and no Court at all,
when few were present, and those few mens silence
also entred as a consent, not many of them vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
it, and those that vnderstood it being ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
at so great Iniustice.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, the <hi>Virginia</hi> Company being now
discharged, it had been fit the Colony had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
about it; and not to dispose of other mens
states and goods, without their consent and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, the very manner of treating of this
Contract, hath bred a suspicion of very indirect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings:
for first it hath been framed secretly and
in the darke: it hath been published but by frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and some principall parts concealed. Some
of the Commissioners appeare to be the cheife and
principall Contracters: other some, though they do
not appeare; yet they are partners with them in their
Trading, are Contracters, which plainely shewes
that they haue an interest in it. And so the same men
are the Contriuers and makers of the bargaine for
themselues, and buyers and sellers, of one and the
same wares; and take away and set the prizes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens goods, for their owne inordinate lucre.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:5317:7"/>
4. Lastly, vnder pretence of doing althings or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,
they haue made a Commitie of themselues,
as in the behalfe of the Colonyes and planters, to
Treate with their fellow Commissioners the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
for speedier payments.</p>
               <p>And most of these men haue they chosen to be
Committies whom the Adventurers and
planters haue a long time complained off
for their exorbitant wrongs to one or
both the plantations.</p>
               <p>Many other exceptions may be taken, but these
shall suffice at this present.</p>
