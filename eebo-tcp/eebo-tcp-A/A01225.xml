            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Theyr captens quaking, and euery man to be reeling,</l>

               <l>Christ for a while conceales that greate dyuynity dreadful,</l>

Vnto the self same trade, which makes theyr glory the greater.</l>

            <l>Tis but a vaine conceipt of fooles, to be fondly referring</l>
            <l>Euery iesting trick, and trifling toy to the Thundrer.</l>
            <l>For loe, these be the men, whose soules are sear'd with an yron,</l>
            <l>And yet these be the men, whoe rule and raigne with aboundance;</l>
            <l>These, and whoe but these? Why then, what meane I to lift vp</l>
            <l>Cleane hands, and pure hart to the heu'ns? What meane I to offer</l>
            <l>Praise and thanksgeuing to the Lord? What meane I to suffer</l>
            <l>Such plagues with patience? Yea, and almost had I spoken</l>
            <l>Eu'n as they did speake, which thought noe God to be guyding.</l>
            <l>But soe should I alas, haue iudgd thyfolk to be luckles,</l>
            <l>Thy sons forsaken, thy saincts vnworthily haples.</l>
            <l>Then did I thick, and muse, and search what might be the matter.</l>
            <l>But yet I could not, alas, conceaue soe hidden a woonder:</l>
            <l>Vntil I left myself, and all my thoughts did abandon,</l>
            <l>And to thy sacred place, to thy Sanct'uary lastly repayred.</l>
            <l>Then did I see, √¥ Lord, these mens vnfortunat endings</l>
            <l>Endings meete and fit for their vngodly beginnings.</l>
            <l>Then did I see how they did stand in slippery places,</l>
            <l>Lifted aloft, that their downefalling might be the greater.</l>
            <l>Lyuing Lord, how soone is this theyr glory triumphant</l>
            <l>Dasht, confounded, gone, drownd in destruction endles?</l>
            <l>Their fame's soone outworne, theyr name's extinct in a moment,</l>
            <l>Lyke to a dreame, that lynes by a sleepe, and dyes with a slumber.</l>
            <l>Thus my soule did greeue, my hart did languish in anguish,</l>
            <l>Soe blynde were myne eyes, my minde soe plunged in error,</l>
            <l>That noe more than a beast did I know this mystery sacred.</l>
            <l>Yet thou heldst my hande, and keptst my soule fro the dungeon,</l>
            <l>Thou didst guyde my feete, and mee with glory receauedst.</l>
            <l>For what in heu'n or in earth shal I loue or woorthyly wonder</l>
            <l>But my most good God, my Lord and mighty <hi>Iehoua?</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Though my flesh oft faint, my hart's oft drowned in horror,</l>
            <l>God neuer fayleth, but wilbe my mighty protector.</l>
            <l>Such as God forsake, and take to a slippery comfort,</l>
            <l>Trust to a broken staffe, and taste of woorthy reuengement.</l>
            <l>In my God therefore my trust is wholly reposed,</l>
            <l>And his name wil I praise, and sing his glory renowned.
