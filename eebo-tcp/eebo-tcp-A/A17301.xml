            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is a sauing, liuing, iustifying faith, being a speciall worke of the Spirit of Christ, and gift of grace, whereby the heart stedfastly beléeueth in Christs righteousnesse imputed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the beléeuer, by which righteousnes of Christ imputed he stands perfectly iustified in Gods sight from all his sins, and so hath an interest to eternall life in and with Christ, as fellow-heirs <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Why doe you call faith in Christ a sauing faith?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> To distinguish it from common historicall faith, mentioned Iam. 2. 19. and to shew it to be an instrument of saluation by Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Why doe you call it a liuing faith?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because vniting the heart and soule to Christ, there is a communion of spirituall life: as <hi>Gal. 2. 20.</hi> this faith also working by loue, whereby it is known from a dead faith, as <hi>Iam. 2. 17.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>Why call yee it a iustifying faith?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Not that it doth iustifie vs as an act or work, but onely as an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:25382:6"/>
applying Christs righteousnesse to our iustification.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>How is this faith wrought in the heart?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> By the Spirit of Christ, and that ordinarily by hearing the word preached.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Why call you this faith a gift of grace?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because it is not of our selues, but it is the frée gift of God: as <hi>Eph. 2. 8. Phil. 1. 29.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>How is this faith stedfast?</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> In a twofold regard: first of sure euidence: secondly, of perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>May a beleeuer then be sure of his saluation by faith?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea hee is, and ought to be so: <hi>[2. Cor. 13. 5.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Doth not a beleeuer often doubt of his saluation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes he may, during some strong fit of temptation: yet as the sunne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a cloud shineth all the while, though we sée it not: so faith vnder the cloud of temptation beléeueth truely though we féele it not.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> First, because it is a frée gift of grace, for the gifts and calling of God <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 29. Ioh.</note> are without repentance. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he that truely beléeueth hath eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, and shall not come into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, but is passed from death vnto life. Thirdly, because Christ pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that our faith faile not, whose prayer must néeds be effectual. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because we are kept by the power of God through faith vnto saluation. Fifthly, from the nature of sauing grace, <hi>Ier. 32. 40.</hi> and <hi>1. Ioh. 3. 9.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Nothinglesse; it being a doctrine of singular comfort to Gods child, to incourage and strengthen him against Satans temptations, and owne infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, as knowing that his faith shall not faile; nor stands it with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a true beléeuer to be carelesse of his saluation, because he is sure of it, sith he knoweth that saluation is not attained, but by the meanes appointed of God, he hath in him an inward prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Faith onely iustifieth as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, and that perfectly in Gods sight: works are said to iustifie before men, but not before God: as <hi>Rom. 4. 2. Iam. 2. 18.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, but not as meritorious cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of saluation, but onely as fruits of faith and duties of loue, and they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed vs to walk in to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; being created in Christ Iesus vnto good workes, that we should walk in them, that according to them, not for them, we may freely receiue the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense of reward.</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> Christ the second Adam, by his exact fulfilling of the Law, and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the penalty of our transgressions, hath fréed vs from the rigour and curse

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> By the very manner of giuing the Law in mount Sina, where before the decalogue or ten commandements, the Lord saith, I am the Lord thy God, which haue brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage: and thereupon inferreth, Thou shalt haue no other Gods before mee, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>Why? what is the meaning of those words, I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> They are not onely a history, but a mystery, containing a cléere type and figure of our redemption by Christ from our spirituall bondage vnder Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and sinne. So that that couenant in Sina being rightly and spiritually vnderstodd, was not the first coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of workes giuen to the first A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, but it was the very euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, the second Couenant of grace and faith giuen in Christ the second Adam.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The law in that place is taken for the first couenant, to wit, of works, which hath no communion with faith belonging to the second couenant. But the Law as it is giuen in mount Sina, the literall veile being remoued, is not deliuered as the first couenant, but as a rule of conuersation to the faithfull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the second couenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. But the Apostle calls the giuing of the Law in mount Sina the first coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, standing in opposition to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, as Agar to Sara, the bond-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to the free, Sina to Sion and Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Apostle compares it so on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in regard of the literall killing sense, to which the carnall Iew was capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, and thereby slaine, while not looking vnto Christ the redéemer, that brought them out of the spirituall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt and bondage, they sought to be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by the workes of the Law, which Saint Paul beates downe in that epistle to the Galatians. But to the beléeuing Iew, the Law was no

other, but the swéet yoake, and light <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 30.</note> burthen of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Shew me then the proper diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between the first Couenant and the second?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The opposite differences betwéen the two couenants are these?</p>
            <p>First: the first couenant was of mans workes: the second of Gods grace; and these two are vnreconcilea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>Rom. 11. 6.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second: The first couenant was made with Adam, and all his posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <note place="margin">Gen. 17. 7. Rom. 9. 8.</note> vniuersally: the second onely with Abrahams séed, called the womans séed, <hi>Gen. 3. 15.</hi> to wit, Christ and all the elect.</p>
            <p>The third: The first couenant stood vpon mans owne righteousnesse: the second stands vpon anothers righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, to wit, Christs righteousnes: made ours by imputation.</p>
            <p>The fourth: The first couenant stood vpon the mutability of mans will, and therefore was quickly broken: but the second stands firme vpon the sure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Gods immutable vnchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able will, <hi>good pleasure,</hi> and <hi>purpose</hi> in himselfe, and so can neuer be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,

called an <hi>euerlasting couenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fifth: The first was acouenant of iustice without mercy: the second was a couenant of méere mercy. <hi>Psal. 89. 28.</hi> yet in Christ iustice and mercy met together. <hi>Psal. 85. 10.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The sixt: The first couenant had no other reward reuealed to the first A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <note place="margin">Es. 27. 9. Rom. 11. 27.</note> (from the earth earthy) but what was confined to the earthly Paradise: but the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d hath the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen reuealed in Christ (the second A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam the Lord from heauen) and by him purchased and prepared vnto all the elect.

            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>It should seeme then, that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state we haue in and by Christ, is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely better then that which we lost in Adam?</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes certainly, and that in regard of many more priuiledges and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues, then haue vet béen mentioned: for by this we are partakers of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature, made one mysticall body of Christ, vnited to him our head, made the adopted Sonnes of God, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heires
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:25382:10"/>

            <p>A. They differ not in regard of their diuine institution, end and vse, all of them pointing out Christ vnto vs in his death, whereby the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace was ratified: onely cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, and the Paschall Lambe poynted out Christ to come, and Baptisme and the Lords Supper point him out already come, as the Lambe slaine.</p>

               <hi>Q. How may a Sacrament be defined, or what is a Sacrament?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> A Sacrament is a sacred action of Christs institution, wherein the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:25382:11"/>
elements sanctisied by the Word, doe not onely signifie and represent to the outward senses, but also instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally conney and seale to the faith of the receiuer that holy inuisible grace whereof it is a signe and seale.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>How proue you this definition of a Sacrament? And first how proue you a Sacrament to be an action?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> By these reasons. <hi>1.</hi> Because it is no longer a sacrament, then it is in the action. <hi>2.</hi> Because the force and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the sacrament consists in the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on rightly performed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>How proue you this in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Thus circumcision is an action, the cutting off the foreskin: The slay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eating of the Passeouer is all in action; so baptizing an action so of the Lords Supper, the whole celebration of it is action, as consecrating, giuing, receiuing, eating, drinking, al is action. Do this in remembrance of me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>What vse make you hereof?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Hereby I learne, that that is no sacrament, which is idly gazed vpon, or reserued in a box, or carryed about in solemne pomp, to be adored for Christ,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:25382:11"/>
but is very Idol.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Why call you the Sacrament an action sacred?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> In regard of the parties conuersant about the sacrament, who are all sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred.</p>

               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. To sanctifie or consecrate the elements by the Word of God &amp; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to a sacramentall or holy vse. <hi>2.</hi> He is to eate and drinke the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. <hi>3.</hi> He is to distribute the consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bread and wine vnto the people the communicants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>What doth the Ministers action in consecrating the elements, and distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them to the people, signifie?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> His consecrating of the elements signifieth Christs consecrating of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for vs; his distributing of them to euery Communicant signifieth, Christ giueth himselfe to euery true beleeuer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>What is the action of the holy</hi>

            <p>

               <hi>Q. What is the action of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants in the Lords Supper?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Twofold: <hi>1.</hi> Outward, with the hand of the body, to take eate, drinke: <hi>2.</hi> Inward, with the hand of the soule, to wit faith, to receiue, and spiritually to faéd vpon the body and bloud of Christ. And with these two is ioyned the action of prayer and thanksgiuing in the very act of receiuing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>How is the minister sacred or holy?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> By his ministeriall calling, as he ought also to be holy in his conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>What if he be profane in his life?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yet that hinders not, but tha the may administer the Sacrament, sith his calling is holy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>How is the Communicant sacred or holy?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Not onely by his common cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as he is a Christian, whereby he hath a right to the outward ordinance: but specially by his holy faith and life,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:25382:12"/>
being a liuing member of Christ, by which he hath an interest to Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the ordinances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. May none of these three agents, the holy Ghost, the Minister, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants <note place="margin">1 Cor 11. 2, 3.</note> be wanting to make vp the full Sacrament?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. No sir, The minister may not communicate alone, without the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple communicating with him; and the element is of no efficacy, without the holy Ghost do apply the inward grace, which he doth to euery beléeuer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>You say a Sacrament is instituted of Christ: why so? may not the Church instiuute a Sacrament?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. No: onely Christ is the authour of a Sacrament: for these reasons: 1. because he is the authour of saluation, and therefore he onely may appoint the meanes, as the Word &amp; Sacraments: secondly, because Christ only can make the Sacraments effectuall by his spirit: thirdly, because his heauenly wisedome knew best how and wherof to institute the sacramentall signes, or elements.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>But may not the Church dispense with the Sacraments, as by altering of them, by adding or taking away?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:25382:13"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> No, in no case, for it brings that curse, <hi>Reuel. 22. 18. 19. Deut. 4. 2. &amp; 12. 32. Pro. 30. 6.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>May not the cup be taken away in the Lords Supper?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No: for it is the communion of the bloud of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Is not the bloud of Christ contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his body, which is represented vnder the formes of bread? and is not the cup then superfluous?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Neither is Christs body carnally vnder the formes of bread: nor is the bread sufficient alone to represent Christs death, without the cup, which powred out doth represent the shedding of Christs bloud for vs, as the bread broken doth the breaking of his body. And Christs ordinance must in no sort be broken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. But doth not the bread &amp; wine, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the words of consecration, cease to be bread and wine, their substance being changed or transubstantiated into the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body and bloud of Christ, nothing but the colour, and sauour of the elements re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The bread and wine being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated by the word &amp; prayer, receiue a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:25382:13"/>
change indéed in regard of their vse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now sacred, which before were common: but not in regard of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, which remaineth one and the same still.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. But is it not said of the bread, This is my body? and of the wine, This is my bloud? And are not Christs words true?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, Christs words are true, and because they are true, therefore the substance of the bread is not changed into the substance of Christs body; and so of the wine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. But is not God omnipotent? Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not he change the substance of bread into the substance of Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> God is omnipotent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cannot lye. But such a change must néeds import and imply a lye: for 1. Christs body is in heauen, and therefore cannot be in earth, and in many places at the same instant. 2. Christs body was made of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Uirgin, and therefore not of the substance of a peece of bread.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Why doth Christ say then, This is my body?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:25382:14"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> He saith no otherwise of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, then he doth of all the rest, both of the old Testament, and of the New. For so circumcision is called the Couenant, being but a signe and seale of it: as <hi>Gen. 17. 10, 11.</hi> The Paschall Lambe is called the Passeouer. <hi>Exod. 12. 11.</hi> though it were but the sacrifice and memoriall of the Passeouer, <hi>v. 27.</hi> So baptisme is called regeneration. <hi>Tit. 3. 5.</hi> though it be but a signe and seale of it. And thus the Sacramentall bread is called Christs body: so that this is the constant language of the holy Ghost in all the sacraments both of the old and new Testament to call the signes by the name of the thing sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, that we might not be deceiued in the meaning of the holy Ghosts words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>But are the Sacramentalll ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments bare signes? Doe they not worke grace effectually of themselues?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> They neither worke grace effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually of themselues, nor are they bare signes: but these signes are called by the name of the thing signified, to signifie that they are meanes ordained of Christ to confirme to the faithfull

receiuer the thing signified, not of themselues, but by vertue of Christs institution, where the conditions of faith and repentance be obserued.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because it is a sorrow for sinne wrought in the heart by Gods Spirit, it being a gift of God. <hi>2.</hi> Because this sorrow mourneth more for Gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, then our owne by-sins, &amp; more for Gods Law broken, then for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment deserued. <hi>3.</hi> While we giue God the whole glory in the séeking pardon of sinne, taking to our selues the whole shame. <hi>4.</hi> While in a sincere <note place="margin">Psal. 51. 4.</note> purpose and endeauour for amendment we rather chuse to suffer the torments of hell, then afresh to sin against God.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because a man can neuer sorrow godly, till he beléeue in Christ the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déemer, so as looking on Christ the Sauiour with the eye of faith he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall reflects vpon himselfe, as the sinner saued by Christ.</p>

               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:25382:18"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> I am to meditate of Christs death, by the things I sée and heare: of the wonderfull loue of God towards me a poore wretched sinner, in that he spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not his Son, but gaue him vp to death for me, that I by beléeuing in him might liue for euer, that as by my body I receiue, eate, and drinke the bread and wine, so by faith I receiue and féed vpon Christ, tasting how swéet the Lord is to my soule: and that I stir vp my heart to be excéeding thankefull for so precious benefits, as <hi>Ps. 103. 1. &amp;c</hi>

               <hi>A.</hi> I must endeauour to walk in the strength of that spiritual meat, as Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as did, vntill I come to the mount of God, the kingdome of heauen,</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No, the comparison holds not. A science is but once grafted, as we into Christ by baptisme, but must be often nourished as in often hearing of the Word, and often communicating at the Lords Table, for (saith the Apostle)
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:25382:19"/>
as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye shew the Lords death till he come: whereby he teacheth vs to frequent the Lords Table vpon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, and constantly to continue the remembrance of his death, that so we may be kept watching, and waiting for that appearing looking for and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting vnto the comming of the day of God, that we may bee found of him in peace, without spot and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse.</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> Though we are to pray continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, yet especially we are to kéepe constant times morning and euening, as Psal. 55. 17. &amp; 92. 2.</p>
            <p>

               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because prayer is a diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God alone. For whom we call vpon by prayer, we beléeue also in him. <hi>Rom. 10. 14.</hi> But we may not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue in Saints and Angels.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. But may we not make Saints and Angels our Mediators of intercession to God for vs, in the Court of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. No: for there is but one Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour betwéene God and man, Iesus Christ. <hi>2. Tim. 2. 5.</hi> In his name what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer we aske the Father, he will giue it vs. And Christ alone is our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour in heauen. <hi>Rom. 8. 24.</hi> He is our onely high priest, who hath entred into heauen, now to appeare in the presence of God for vs. <hi>Heb. 9. 24.</hi> So that none can bee our Mediatour or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessour in heauen, but onely our High Priest, which is Christ. <hi>Heb. 9. 11, 12.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>But may we not be stirred by pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures and images of God, and of Christ, and the like, and so before them pray vnto God?</hi>

               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:25382:20"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> No, in no sort, for this is flatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the second commandement: Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any grauen image, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>But may we not pray before them, though we pray not vnto them, but vnto God represented by them?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for we are forbidden to make any image or picture of God at all; much lesse are we to worship God in or by it. <hi>Deut. 4. 15, 16.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. True, God forbad them to make no similitude of him, because they saw no forme of God in the mount? But may we not make the picture of Christ, and so pray before it, or a crucifixe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No, in no wise; for to make such a picture, were to make a lie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a false representation: for first no man now for 16. hundred years almost, euer saw Christs body as he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death. And secondly no mortall eye can behold his face in heauen, which passeth the brightnes of the sun. And thirdly, though we had the true picture of his body yet it is not lawfull to pray before it, as hauing no warrant in Scripture for it but against it, as in the second commandement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:25382:20"/>Q. <hi>But may we not pray for our friends departed?</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No, it is vaine, because all that die goe immediately either to heauen, or to hell. When Dauids child was dead, he ceased praying for it, saying, <hi>Wherefore should I fast or pray any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi> And there is no example nor rule in Scripture for praying for men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, so as it is against our faith in Gods word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>But is there not a third and mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle place, namely Purgatory, where souls must be purged before they come into heauen, into which no vncleane thing can enter.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Purgatory is a méere deuice of mans braine to pick fools purses, who must pay swéetly for so many masses for their friends soules. And it is a blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous doctrine, destroying the blood of Christ, which alone doth purge eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true beléeuer from all his sins. <hi>1 Ioh. 1. 7.</hi> It leaues neither spot, nor wrinkle, nor any such thing, <hi>Eph. 5. 27.</hi> And for Purgatory it is not so much as once named in all the Scripture, as heauen and hell are. And if purgatory or any materiall fire could purge away sinne,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:25382:21"/>
as it neuer can: then Christs blood was spilt needlesly and in vaine. And it is against nature for a materiall fire to work vpon a spirituall substance, as mans soule is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>Is faith in Christ then sufficient to carry a man straight to heauen?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes surely; for so Christ saith, <hi>Ioh. 5. 24.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>But no man is saued out of the Church: which is then the true Church of Christ visible?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. That Church whose faith is guided by the onely rule of Gods Word, and hath the due administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sacraments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Cannot that be a true Church of of Christ visible, which denyeth the Scriptures to be the onely rule of faith?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. It cannot. Because the onely rule to know the true Church by, is the Scripture. Secondly, because humane Traditions being against the Word of God, and yet added to it, as an equal rule of faith, and of equall authority, quite razeth the foundation of faith. Because such Traditions destroy the Scriptures; and in vaine do such wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to God; teaching for doctrines

            <p>A. No. Such is neither the onely true Church, no nor yet a true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the true Church of Christ visible on earth.</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> Because such a visible Head must needs be the great Antichrist, who vsurpes that title and office which is proper to Christ alone: for such a one, as the Pope, saith in effect, <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Q. <hi>But is not that the onely true Church of Christ visible which only can shew a visible &amp; vninterrupted successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Bishops sitting in Peters chaire, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer since the Apostles times? Is not this visibility of succession an infallible mark of the true Church of Christ visible?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No surely: for first, for Peters chaire, thats but made of cunning net work, to inclose and catch the silly fish. And if euer Peter had béene Bishop of Rome, what is Peters chaire without Peters faith and doctrine? They haue
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:25382:22"/>
quite destroyed Peters doctrine, <hi>2 Pet. 5. 2.</hi> who said, féed the flocke of God, &amp;c. taking the ouer sight of it, not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, but willingly, not for filthy lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre, but of a ready mind, neither as being Lords ouer Gods heritage, but being ensamples to the flocke. But the Pope and his Clergy doe quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>Secondly, visible succession of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops is no true mark of a true Church of Christ, vnlesse it can shew a true suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of doctrine from the Apostles writings. For may not errours and heresies créepe vpon the same particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar visible Church, and so in time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly like a gangrene, eate into the very heart of it, and so leaue it nothing but the very carcasse of a Church, as it hath: done with the Church of Rome?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the succession of Romish Bishops hath had many interruptions, so as the chaire hath béene empty for many yéeres together, the body wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a head, or els hauing sometimes two, sometimes thrée heads at once, while thrée Popes were at once. Once a woman Pope made the interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And so many hereticall Popes, so
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:25382:23"/>
many Simoniacall, so many exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing diabolicall artes, haue made a fearfull interruption, neuer to be made vp againe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>But how can the Protestant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches proue themselues true Churches, while they cannot shew an vninterrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted line of succession of such and such Doctours, as haue from age to age conueyed the Doctrine of Christ and of his Apostles downe to our very times?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> This is as friuolous, as it would be a tedious taske. It suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth vs, that we can shew our faith to be euidently grounded vpon do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Apostles, and so we are sure wee succéede them in their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and faith, though perhaps wée cannot punctually and particularly number vp all those Doctours, by whom we haue receiued it from hand to hand. It sufficeth we haue our eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences to sh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w out title and right to our inheritance. Let those that want the euidences of Scripture, which we haue, prooue their pretended title by a long beadrow of personall successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Blessed be God we haue the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:25382:23"/>
to prooue our faith and religion by, and we néed séeke no further, though wee could shew how our faith hath béene professed in all ages from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles dayes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>If it be so; how comes it, that the Romish Priests and Iesuites doe so stand vpon succession, and put vs to proue our religion by naming all those Doctours in all ages, who from one to another haue brought our religion home to our doores?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. This is a méere shift, whereby they gull and beguile silly soules, and so they gaine time in exacting that, which they themselues are neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to shew on their part. For they cannot exactly tell the punctuall time, wherein all their errours, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlesse ceremonies entred into their Church, nor can they tell the authors of them perfectly, It sufficeth that the enuious man, Satan did sow so many tares in that field, while the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, drowned in sensualitie, were fast asléepe. Yet all that while, God had his Church, though persecuted here and there by Antichrist and his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: which Church blessed be God we
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:25382:24"/>
Protestants in England now a long time haue iniored, and pray and trust we shall enioy to the comming of Iesus Christ. Euen so come Lord Iesus. Amen.</p>
