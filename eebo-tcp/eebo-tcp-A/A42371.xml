            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

proſecution. That the Clauſe in the 21. K. <hi>James,
chap.</hi> 3. viz. for all informations upon penal Statutes to

reaſon the Judges, <hi>alias</hi> Sheriffs, are the offenders, and

ſent for his Father and Mother to diſ-ſwade him and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade

took another.</p>
               <p>(D) He murthered Duke <hi>Arthur</hi> Earl of <hi>Brittan</hi> his eldeſt Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Son, being Heir to the Crown, in the Caſtle of <hi>Roan</hi> in
<hi>France,</hi> and chaſed <hi>William de Branes</hi> out of <hi>England,</hi> and cauſed

               <p>(I) He was the cauſe of firing the chief Town in <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi>
called <hi>Morpeth,</hi> and cauſed many more Towns in

               <p>The Barons of <hi>England</hi> being armed, demanded of him the

vulgarly called St. <hi>Edward,</hi> he deſired reſpite till Eaſter, and
gave Sureties to perform them.</p>
               <p>(K) He met with the Barons of <hi>England</hi> in Running Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,<note place="margin">15 year.</note>

Nations for Armies to make void thoſe Charters and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
granted to the Barons, and to ſubdue <hi>England,</hi> and
promiſed them great rewards, Forty thouſand Souldiers
that were to have <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi> to conquer <hi>England</hi> for
King <hi>John</hi> were all caſt away on the Sea. The Pope ſends
in great ſtrength, who landed at <hi>Dover,</hi> and deſtroyed many

by their names, great ſubverſion and diſſolution thereupon
fell, laying all Hedges and Ditches level, tormenting the
Barons,<note place="margin">16 year.</note> with their wives, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>(L) The Barons were neceſſitated to ſend for <hi>Lewis,</hi> Son
to the King of <hi>France,</hi> for to come with an Army to joyn
with them to conquer King <hi>John,</hi> whoſe cruelties were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable,
which was done, and King <hi>John</hi> overthrown,
and forced to flee towards <hi>Lin;</hi> being poyſoned by a Monk
at <hi>Swinſted</hi> (the reaſon he gave was, that if he had lived
half a year longer,<note place="margin">17 year.</note> a half penny loaf would coſt 20 s.) he
died, and was buried at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and King <hi>Henry</hi> the third,

Son to King <hi>John</hi> of nine years of age, was crowned at
<hi>Gloceſter,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>(M) The reaſon of King <hi>John</hi> his granting Charters in
<hi>England,</hi> and making Corporations, was for that he had but
little land, to raiſe great Rents from them, and to aſſiſt him
with ſtrength by out-voting the Knights of (M) the Shires,
as is hereafter expreſt; For all Free-holders of <hi>England</hi> that
had forty ſhillings a yeer, met two times a yeer at Seſſions
Meadows neer <hi>Rockingham</hi> Caſtle in <hi>Northampton-ſhire,</hi> and
there made ſuch Laws as the Nation was governed by, and
confirmed by the King.</p>
               <p>(N) King <hi>John</hi> reſolving to have Monies and Aid of men
to go to <hi>Normandy</hi> to conquer them, could not conveniently
motion it, by reaſon of the numerouſneſſe of the Free-holders,
but made a ſpeech to them, that he had contrived a
very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it and convenient way for the making Laws for the
good of the whole Nation, which was, that by reaſon he
conceived it a great trouble, for all them to come ſo far for
that purpoſe, onely to make Laws, that they would chuſe
two Knights of every Shire and County in <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Wales,</hi> and give to them the full power of the Nation, and
then the ſaid Knights to come and fit with him in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and alſo to allow them four ſhillings a
day, out of the County ſtock, which more plainly appears
in the Statute of 35. <hi>Hen. 8. Ch.</hi> 11. Knights to have 4 <hi>s. per
diem,</hi> and Burgeſſes 2 <hi>s. per diem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(O) King <hi>John</hi> when he had got the hundred and four
Knights in Parliament, they having the full power of the
Nation from the Free-holders, immediately required from
them great Subſidies, and Armies to go for <hi>Normandy,</hi> to
recover ſuch Lands as he had loſt.</p>
               <p>(P) The Knights anſwered, they onely were intruſted to
make Laws, and not to taxe the Free-holders, who had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
them, and not to raiſe Armies, and that by ſo doing,
they could not diſcharge the truſt repoſed in them.</p>
               <p>(Q) The King finding his expectation fruſtrated, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
nothing doubted, but to have wrought his deſign on ſo
ſmall a number (Maſtered his paſſion, and not long after
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58145:8"/>
acquainted the Knights, that he was ſorry for the great
burden which lay upon them for making Laws, being for a
publick, and that they were too few in number, and that he
had found out a way how to eaſe them, and bring in a great
revenew to free the Nation from impoſitions.</p>
               <p>(R) Which was, that he reſolved to Incorporate all the
great Towns in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> and depute Magiſtrates
to govern as his Lieutenants, and every Corporation ſhould
hold their Town in Fee-Farm from him and his heirs at a
certain Rent, ſome more, others leſſe, according to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>(S) Alſo that every Corporation ſhould chuſe two Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the ſtate of every County, and the Burgeſſes of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
(by which means the Burgeſſes being more in
number then the Knights might out-vote them, and vote
for him) the Knights medled not therein at all, but were
out-voted by theſe Vaſſals and Tenants to the King, they
granting to him what ever he demanded, or elſe muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
their Charters: And he granted to them what ever
they demanded &amp;c.</p>
               <p>(T) The Free-holders of <hi>England</hi> were repreſented in
Parliament by their Knights in their Election; And if the
Burgeſſes were Free-holders, then repreſented in the ſame
Knights.</p>
               <p>(V) But if the Burgeſſes were no Free-holders, then no
power in <hi>England</hi> to make Laws, or to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

He alſo granted to them, for him and his Heirs, that in

dated at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the tenth day of <hi>May</hi> in the one

with an addition of his own, that he for himſelf,
and his Heirs, Granted, Demiſed, and Confirmed unto his
honeſt men of the Town of the <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tyne,</hi> his
Town of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> before called <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> with all its

the ſaid King, and his Heirs, &amp;c. Which he the ſaid King
confirms to the ſaid men, and Burgeſſes, and to their Heirs
for ever. And becauſe on the behalf of the ſaid Burgeſſes
of the ſaid Town, it was humbly ſupplicated to the ſaid
King, That whereas the ſaid Moore and Lands called Caſtle-fields,
and Caſtle-moor on the North-ſide of the ſaid Town
of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> from a certain place called Ingler Dike, &amp;c. as
the ſame are butted and bounded, &amp;c. even to the ſaid

of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> belonging to the ſame, beyond memory;
with all profits coming of the ſaid Lands, Moor, and Soil,
as by an Inquiſition thereof taken, and returned into the
Chancery appeareth. And albeit the ſaid Burgeſſes, and
their Predeceſſors from the time they have had the ſaid
Town to farm, they have held the ſaid Moor and Land, as
though it were appertaining to the ſaid Town, and have
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58145:10"/>
alwayes hitherto peaceably, and quietly had, and reaped all
the profits coming of the ſaid Moor and Lands, yet the
ſaid Burgeſſes (now they are turned from honeſt men, to
Burgeſſes, the next will be to—) For that there is no
mention made of the ſaid Moor and Lands (albeit they be
of the Appurtenances of the ſaid Town) do fear that they
may be impeached afterwards, and for that the ſaid Town,
as well by reaſon of the laſt Peſtilence at that time, as by
the hazards of Wars, and divers other adverſities, was ſo
impoveriſhed, and deſtitute of men, that the profits of the
ſaid Town ſufficed not for the payment of the ſaid Farm
(as they then pretended.) The ſaid King being willing to
provide for their indempnity in that behalf, and for him,

and vending of all Coals to ſhipping. And in conſideration
thereof, they would pay to her Majeſty, and her ſucceſſors
twelve pence for every Chalder, exported from thenceforth
to the free people of this Nation. The Queen conceiving
that twelve pence upon every Chalder would be better for

then the two pence ſo long in arrear could endamage, which
was granted upon condition ſpecified in that Grant, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining

which the ſaid Maſters payes the one ſhilling <hi>per</hi> Chalder
Cuſtome, being allowed in his hand, the Maſter conceives
he doth not pay it further then being left in his hand by the
Fitter; but if the Maſters will look upon that Leaſe, they
will find they are to have the beſt Coals for ten ſhillings,

               <p>As to Preſcription a <hi>Quo Warrante</hi> will avoid that upon

               <p>And as to plead Cuſtom, they have no right, nor never

(A) KIng <hi>James</hi> in the ſecond year of his reign, being
humbly ſupplicated by the Mayor and Burgeſſes of
<hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> that he would be graciouſly pleaſed to confirm all
their antient Grants and Charters, and to give them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
powers, eſpecially of the River of <hi>Tyne,</hi> The King
confirms their Charters, but grants nothing new, onely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
the Election of their Officers, and preſcribes them new
Oathes to be adminiſtred to the ſaid Officers in their Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which Charter is in the Chappel of Rolls.</p>
               <p>(B) Alſo the King and his Council grants them the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmancy
of the River of <hi>Tyne,</hi> by giving nine Articles up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the 29. of <hi>January</hi> 1613. and joyned in the ſaid Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
The Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi> and other Juſtices of Peace
of the County of <hi>Durham</hi> and <hi>Northumberland,</hi> with the ſix
Aldermen of the ſaid Town of <hi>Newcaſtle:</hi> But three years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
being weary of partners, the Mayor, Aldermen and a
Jury of the Burgeſſes, exhibited a great complaint to the
King and Council at White-hall, of the great decay of that
River occaſioned by the ſaid Commiſſioners, through their
neglect, and breach of Truſt. Which Complaint, begat this
following Reference from the Council Table, and further
power to add to the former, See chap. 34. (C.) 35. (A.B) 28.
(A P)</p>
               <p>(C) Whereas upon complaint of the decay of the River
of <hi>Tyne,</hi> and of the daily abuſes done and committed to the
prejudice of the ſame. Certain Articles were granted on
the 29 of <hi>January</hi> 1613. and commanded to be put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the remedy of ſuch abuſes. And for as much as a
Jury of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi>-men have by their Petition to this Board
grievouſly complained thoſe Articles were wholly neglected
by the Mayor and ſix Aldermen of the ſame Town, and the
Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi> and Juſtices of Peace, all which were
joynt Commiſſioners for the preſervation of that River;
The River decaying ſo faſt, that in ſhort time it would be
dord and wrecked up with ſand, &amp;c. If not Order ſoon
taken therein. The Council Ordered Sir <hi>Ralph Winwood,</hi> Sir
<hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> and Sir <hi>Daniel Dun</hi> one of the Judges of the
Admiralty, with the aſſiſtance of the Trinity Maſters of

with the former nine. And by ſpecial Order of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Council at White-hall was given and commanded that
all the ſaid Two and twenty Articles be put in execution
for the conſervation and preſervation of the River of <hi>Tyne</hi>
by the Commiſſioners hereafter named. Or elſe to forfit all
the Towns Liberties into the Kings hands. See chap. 13.</p>
               <p>(D) And though the Commiſſioners formerly appointed
for the execution of the former Articles, are perſons of

publick. Yet for as much as contrary to the Truſt repoſed
in them they have altogether neglected their duty therein,
whereof further notice may be taken as occaſion ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.
It is thought expedient that theſe perſons following
be named and authorized Commiſſioners for the due per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance

bearing date the 29. of <hi>January</hi> 1613. as of thoſe now

               <p>(A) ON the 4th. of <hi>December</hi> 1634. certain Lands and
Waſts were diſcovered to the late Kings Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners,
at the Commiſſionhouſe in Fleetſtreet, as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Crown concealed, eſpecially a parcel of Land or
Waſte in the River of <hi>Tyne,</hi> called <hi>Jarrow Slike</hi> at <hi>South-Shields</hi>
in the County of <hi>Durham,</hi> which the water at a full
Sea covers every Tyde, and is by eſtimation 300 Acres, a fit
and convenient place for ſhips to caſt Ballaſt at, for many
years to come, without any prejudice to the River, and
great furtherance of Trade, See Chap. 56. Chap. 34.
(A. B)</p>
               <p>The Mayor and Burgeſſes of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> hearing thereof
put in their Claim to the ſaid Commiſſioners, and alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that all that ground belonged to them, with all other
grounds to a low-water mark, from the full Sea mark on
both ſides the River from a place called <hi>Sparhawke</hi> in the Sea,
to <hi>Headwin-ſtreams,</hi> which is ſeven miles above <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi>
being fourteen miles in length granted to them and their
Heirs for ever, from King <hi>John</hi> by Charter, and confirmed
by his Succeſſors; and therefore beſeeched time to make it
ſo appear. (There being no ſuch thing granted, could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
make it appear.) Along time was given them, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58145:30"/>
appeared as truth of any ſuch Grant, and two years
after, upon the firſt day of <hi>July,</hi> 1637. they inſtead of
wearying out the Commiſsioners and Gentlemen that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
the ſame, was called to make good their claim,
then they became Petitioners to the Kings Commiſsioners,
that they would be pleaſed to ſell that parcel of waſt ground
called Jarrow-ſlike to them, and to admit them to purchaſe
the ſame, for which they would give two hundred pounds,
by reaſon it lay more convenient for them, then any elſe,
but they would give no more money for it. See chap. 18.
(<hi>A. B</hi>) See chap. 2.</p>
               <p>Upon which, one Mr. <hi>Thomas Talbot,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Richard
Allen</hi> of <hi>London</hi> gave four hundred pound and got it. The
King upon the 27 of <hi>November</hi> 1637. by his Letters Pattents
under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> confirmed the ſame Jarrow-ſlike,
and waſte ground upon the ſaid <hi>Talbot</hi> and <hi>Allen,</hi> and
their Heirs for ever, they paying in to the Exchequor
five pound <hi>per annum,</hi> as a Fee-farm Rent, which ſaid ground
is in conteſt between the ſaid Gentlemen, and Sir <hi>Henry
Vane.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this ground to a full Sea-Mark were really the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
of <hi>Newcaſtles.</hi> it would have ſo appeared in the
Charter granted by King <hi>John,</hi> and alſo they then might
have made good their claim, and not to have become Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners
to purchaſe the thing which was their own before
even as they do in this, ſo in other things.)</p>
               <p>Alſo if all ground be theirs from a full Sea-mark, why
were they Tenants to the late Dean and Chapters of
<hi>Durham,</hi> of certain ballaſt ſhores built to the low water-mark,
on which all ballaſt is caſt.</p>
               <p>And if all ground were <hi>Newcaſtles</hi> from a full Sea-mark,
why ſhould Mr. <hi>Bonner,</hi> &amp;c. buy the Lady <hi>Gibs</hi> ground, and
build a Ballaſt-ſhoar to a low water-mark, and wrong the
Town of their right. And why ſhould not <hi>Gates-head,</hi> and
both the ſhields which are built to a low water-mark, pay
<hi>Newcaſtle</hi> rent, &amp;c. See Chap. 18. (B) 34. (A. B.)</p>

in any of the two Counties to ſell their own Coals, but
the owners muſt either ſel their Coals to the free Hoaſt-men,
at what price they pleaſe, and then all ſhips muſt give

will not do what the Mayor and Burgeſſes commands

the copy of the charge, where the full Committee was met,

charge, &amp; the deſires were read, to the foregoing Gentlemen.</p>
                  <p>(A. S.) The Corporation, Agents and Aldermen humbly
begged ten weeks longer time, by reaſon they were not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,

that was neer and dear unto them<note n="*" place="margin">Oppreſſion.</note>. And hoped the Town
would not be ſurpriſed, and that they did conceive Mr.
<hi>Gardner</hi> had ſent down that order to affront the Town, by
reaſon it was dropt at the Mayors door by a boy; And
that there was a Paper printed by Mr. <hi>Gardner</hi> which was
as full of lyes, as words, which did conclude them, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58145:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their Witneſſes, alſo that the Scots having tumbled
their Records, could not draw up an anſwer in ſo ſhort a time.</p>
                  <p>(A. T.) In anſwer to the Town, it was humbly moved,
their Honours would give no longer time, by reaſon it was
the day ſet, and agreed upon, that they of the Corporation
ſhould plead, and that it was no new matter inſiſted upon,
but what was debated at that Board two years before, the
Records and Judgement given againſt <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> being in
their Honors cuſtody, and that they were as wel able to plead
then, as at any other time, and if there were any new matter
it ſhould be withdrawn, and was willing to joyn iſſue upon
the former Judgement granted two years before, at the ſame
Board.</p>
                  <p>The Towns Agents altogether refuſed that, and hoped
their Honours would not inſiſt upon the former Judgement,
but to give them longer time, they not being ready to
plead to the ſaid charge, nor came prepared upon the earneſt
ſolicitation of the Towns Agents: The Committee told
them, that if they would deal clearly and candidly with
them, as to give in writing under their hands ſuch an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to the charge as they would ſtand and fall by, then
they would give them their own time, if not, then they
would record that fair motion, and that they muſt plead by
reaſon they appeared, and entred upon a plea, and their
work was very ſhort, for all that they had to do, was to
plead Guilty, or not Guilty; if guilty, then to make it good
by what Law they did ſuch things as was laid to their
charge, (and if not guilty, then it was left to Mr. <hi>Gardner</hi> to
prove his Charge, (who indeed had proved all ſufficiently)
and therefore would give no more day, what ever, then the
13 of <hi>December,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gardner</hi> left free to bring in what
more he had to charge them with; Upon the 12 day of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi>
the Parliament was diſmiſſed.</p>
                  <p>But the Honourable Committee met in <hi>White-hall,</hi> and
drew up another report, and ſigned the ſame againſt the

                  <p>

often thereby add fuel unto the fire of Gods wrath, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

                  <p>(C) Thirty women were brought into the Town-hall,
and ſtript, and then openly had pins thruſt into their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and moſt of them was found guilty *, near twenty
ſeven of them by him and ſet aſide.</p>
                  <p>(D) The ſaid reputed Witch-finder acquainted Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Colonel <hi>Hobſon</hi> that he knew women, whether they
were Witches or no by their looks, and when the ſaid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
was ſearching of a perſonable, and good like woma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the ſaid Colonel replyed and ſaid, ſurely this woman is none,
and need not be tried, but the Scotch-man ſaid ſhe was, for
the Town ſaid ſhe was, and therefore he would try her;
and preſently in ſight of all the people laid her body naked
to the Waſte, with her cloaths over her head, by which fright
and ſhame, all her blood contracted into one part of her
body, and then he ran a pin into her Thigh, and then
ſuddenly let her coats fall, and then demanded whether ſhe
had nothing of his in her body but did not bleed, but ſhe
being amazed replied little, then he put his hand up her
coa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, and pulled out the pin and ſet her aſide as a guilty
perſon, and child of the Devil, and fell to try others whom
he made guilty.</p>
                  <p>(E) Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Hobſon</hi> perceiving the alteration
of the foreſaid woman, by her blood ſettling in her right
parts, cauſed that woman to be brought again, and her
cloathes pulled up to her Thigh, and required the Scot to
run the pin into the ſame place, and then it guſhed out of
blood, and the ſaid Scot cleared her, and ſaid ſhe was not
a child of the Devil.</p>
                  <p>(F) So ſoon as he had done, and received his wages,
he went into <hi>Northumberland</hi> to try women there, where he
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:58145:59"/>
got of ſome three pound a peece. But <hi>Henry Ogle</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> a

Bond of him to anſwer the Seſſions, but he got away for <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and it was conceived if he had ſtaid he would have made
moſt of the women in the North Witches, for mony.</p>

Trade, but advantage the whole Nation, eſpecially that
Town, by reaſon double Trade will be drove thereby, and
cauſe Coals to be cheaper at half Rates then now they are at,
and the River better preſerved.</p>
               <p>(D) Secondly, it will better the River, for Inning of
void and waſte grounds and flats in Rivers cauſeth the
ſtreams to be more ſtrong, and run more ſwift, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
will ſoowr and cleanſe the channel, and conſequently
gain more water to the River, preſerve the banks from falling

Navigable, the leſſe danger, and more ſafety for ſhips. See

               <p>When the <hi>Normans</hi> ruled <hi>England,</hi> the Laws were in that

Rulers, Monopolies were in force, but now ſuch power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>All Kings were ſworn that Juſtice ſhould neither be

               <p>Charters are no other than Commiſſions, Impowring per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
uncapable of the Laws, to be Judges and Juſtices in

                     <hi>WIlliam</hi> the Conqueror having killed many, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
the land, and brought under his ſubjection,
the people, cauſed ſuch who did oppoſe his forces, at <hi>Ely,</hi> to
have their legs and hands cut off, and their eyes put out, and
then gave liberally to all his <hi>Norman</hi> race, Earldoms, Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
Biſhopricks Honours, Mannors, Dignities, and Farms,
all being got by the ſword; Upon his Diviſions, &amp;c. the Earle
of <hi>Flanders</hi> ſent to know what part he ſhould have for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
him, who ſent him word nothing at all, by reaſon all
was but little enough for himſelf; Then he gave to his Son
<hi>Robert Cuming</hi> the Earldome of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> who in
poſſeſſing of it, acted ſuch cruelty with his Army, which
came againſt <hi>Malcolm</hi> King of the Scots. The ſaid <hi>Robert</hi>
built the Caſtle called the <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> upon the River of
<hi>Tyne</hi> in the County of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> about which was
built the Town called <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> the Town taking its name
from the <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and not the Caſtle from the Town, the
ſaid <hi>Northumberland</hi> being ſo oppreſſed, that they fell upon
<hi>Robert</hi> Son to the Conqueror, killed him, and his whole
Army; Upon which <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror ſent another
Army, who had command to kill both men, women, and
children, who did it, and waſted the whole County, that
for nine yeers there was not any food to be got: And ſuch
who had hid themſelves in Coal-pits, and other places, were
conſtrained to eat Dogs and Cats, dead Horſes, and mens

them.</p>
                  <p>Little of Confeſſion or Repentance was by King <hi>John,</hi> as
was by <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, for he upon his Arreſt at the
Suit of Death, confeſſed he had committed many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages,
and won <hi>England</hi> by the Sword, and not by Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and was heartily ſorry for the wrongs he had done,
and required his body to be buried at <hi>Cain</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi>
when he was dead, they would not affoard him a burial-place
till ſuch time as one of his relation was conſtrained to
purchaſe ſo much ground, but ſoon after they defaced his
Tomb, took up his bones, and brake them, and caſt them
away.</p>
                  <p>In the fifteenth year of King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, the
Scots burnt all the Towns of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and the North,
as far as <hi>York,</hi> except <hi>Rippon,</hi> who redeemed themſelves with
a ſum of mony.</p>
                  <p>In the ſixth year of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, 1332. a great
Battel was fought between the Engliſh and the Scots near
<hi>Barwick,</hi> where was killed eight Earls, fifteen hundred
Horſe, and thirty five thouſand Foot.</p>
                  <p>In the thirteenth year of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, 1339.

two hundred in a houſe, and then ſhut the doors, and fired

                  <p>1399. King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, cauſed ſeventeen Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

Reader, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>It is no ſmall mercy that we now live ſo in peace, here
being none of thoſe bloody times, and our Anceſtors would

                  <p>Many have admired the poverty of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> as
well they may, for what with the bloody Tyrants, the Scots
on the North of that poor County, and oppreſſive Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> on the South thereof, bounded in
with the High-lands on the Weſt, and the Sea on the Eaſt,
that it can get nothing but ſtroaks, and worried out of what
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58145:66"/>
they have, and not being tollerated to make uſe of their
own, and cold blaſts from the Sea; but it would be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
if ſuch Gentlemen might be re-imburſed for ſuch ſums
of money as they would expend to vend Coals out of
<hi>Hartly, Blithe,</hi> and <hi>Bedlington</hi> Rivers, which be convenient
places to vend them at, after ſome charge, which would be
done, by having either their money again, or Cuſtome free,
for ſome years to re-imburſe them, which would not onely
make that poor County as rich as any is, but reduce the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
rates of Coals and Salt, and bring in many thouſands
<hi>per Annum</hi> into the publick revenew, &amp;c. enable the people
to be ſerviceable, and abundantly increaſe Trade and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation,
as alſo there being as good Coals as poſſibly can be
burnt, which now lyes, &amp;c. and others not knowing their

                  <p>But if one thing they look after, which is to examine
ſome Records, they may perceive what is their Rights, and
which was, eſpecially in a book lodged in the Exchequor,
made in the year 1080. it being called <hi>Domus Dei,</hi> or

               <p>THe reaſon of my Collecting theſe few Statutes is, to
ſhew how they are intrenched upon by an illegal Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and preſſing upon a remedy ſhal, cite <hi>Poulton,</hi> which is, that
ſeeing we have all received, and allow it for truth, that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58145:67"/>
the ignorance of the Law, doth excuſe none of offence;
and alſo that the Law doth help the watchful, and not the
ſloathful man.</p>
               <p>Therefore it behoveth each perſon firſt to ſeek the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of thoſe Laws, under which he doth live, and whereby
he is to receive benefit, or to ſuſtain peril, and next with all
induſtry to frame his obedience unto them, or humbly to
ſubmit himſelf to the cenſure of them.</p>
               <p>And though we find by experience that ſome men by the
ſluggiſhneſſe of their natures, others by the careleſneſſe of
their own welfares; And a third ſort wholly given over to
pleaſures and vanities do little reſpect to know, and leſſe to
obey our criminal and capital Laws, being things of great
moment &amp; importance, and therefore do oftentimes taſte the
ſmart of them, and repent of their follies when it is too late.</p>
               <p>Many there be that by reading, deſires to conceive them,
others for increaſe of their knowledge, others in their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to be directed by them; therefore to content ſuch as
knoweth not as yet, theſe heads that they may know what
they condemn, and do tend to the breach of the peace of
the Realm, and to the diſlike of all the good members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
and what puniſhments ſhe hath impoſed upon the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors

inflicted eſpecially upon Murder, Robbery, Riots, Forgery,
Perjury, Extortion, and Oppreſſion, in any of which caſes,
any perſon maketh it his own cauſe, and doth in a ſort take
it to be done to himſelf, and ought to reduce the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor;
Nay his Highneſſe by his Oath, and all people elſe
are bound to puniſh them as being Tranſgreſſors of his
Laws and diſquieters of the Peace, therefore ought to be
rooted out, as the Husbandman the thiſtle from the good

wherefore ſeeing a guilty perſon in any of the offences
aforeſaid is perſecuted in deed, or conſent by all, wiſhing

               <p>It is requiſite that good men which eſchew to offend for
the love of vertue, and evill men, which fear to offend for
the dread of puniſhment, ſhould both know thoſe Laws,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58145:67"/>
which they are to make uſe of, and the penalties which be
threatned to the infringers thereof, to the intent the good
man having a will to ſtand, may truſt to his feet, remain

               <p>Theſe Laws are preſervers of the peace, and layes heavy
puniſhments, upon the withſtanders, or deniers thereof they
are his Highneſſe Privy Councellors inceſſantly, reſpecting
the preſervation of his Perſon, and Dignity; they be as his
Gentlemen Pentioners attending daily his preſence to do him
all Honor and Service, being as the Yeomen of his Guard,
waiting day and night to protect him, for his protecting the
Nation and them, and from all forcible aſſaults, and other
perils. Alſo they be as his great and goodly Ships, which

Judges, Juſtices, Sheriffs, Conſtables, and other Officers,
watching every hour and moment, in all Shires and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
places, and corners of the Nation, to repreſſe outrages,
and to maintain peace.</p>
               <p>To maintain theſe Laws, every good member hath the
like benefit as himſelf hath, for in fear of them, every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
doth enjoy his life and limbs in peace, and is defended
from the bloody-minded Murderer, and Man-queller, and
the rage of the furious Quarreller and Fighter, and in fear
of them, the houſe-keeper reſteth in peace with his wife

               <p>And we ſhould now obſerve with what care our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers

in Churches, in Fairs, in Markets, at the General
Aſſizes, and Quarter-Seſſions of every County, at Leets and
Law-dayes, and in every Inns of Court, and Chancery, and
how the ſame is continued and put in practice, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that the ſame Laws, and the penalties thereof, ſhould
be heard, learned, known, and underſtood by all ſorts
of perſons, willing to perceive, and apprehend the
ſame.</p>
               <p>Charter-Law is not ſo, but like the foul Spirit in the
Air, ſtill ranging, never at reſt, nor will let others take
any, never ſeen, but heard in every corner, ſtriking at
the pure Law, to advance it ſelf, it forces people to a
kind of an Order in a Town, and the whole Nation to a
diſorder.</p>
               <p>The chiefeſt reaſon, why I give a recital of the Penal-Laws,
is, that the ignorant may ſee how well they are provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for, and not to be left blind, and only being inſtructed by

(but that they may know themſelves) and to remedy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

If all the Pictures and Patterns of a mercileſs Prince
were loſt in the World, they might all again be painted to the life out
of the Story of that King.</p>
            <p>So having given the world an account of the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian,
illegal, oppreſſive practices of the <hi>Magiſtrates of
Newcaſtle</hi> upon the people of this Nation, whoſe either

Traffique or any other way, though forced into that Port
and Harbor, by diſtreſs of weather, tempeſt or any other
accident incident to thoſe that go down to the Seas in
Ships, and occupie their buſineſſes in the waters; Reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on their Actions, I may ſafely ſay of them as that <hi>Noble
Knight</hi> did of that King, <hi>If all the Pictures and Patterns of a
cruell and mercileſs people were utterly loſt in the world, they might
be all painted to the life out of this Narrative,</hi> ſetting out the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal
Oppreſſions, arbitrary Exactions, barbarous Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
practiſed and committed by the <hi>Magiſtrates of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle,</hi>
both on their Neighbors, and the free people of this
Nation.</p>
            <p>There are two Rules or Canons in Scripture upon
which all the Commandements of the ſecond Table (and
conſequently, all the duty of man to his Neighbor) do
depend.</p>
            <p>The Firſt is, <hi>Quod tibi fieri non vis alteri ne feceris, What
thou wouldſt not have another do unto thee, that thou oughteſt not do
unto another.</hi> This Rule well obſerved prevents all injury
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:58145:102"/>
and wrong: for while a man frames his own actions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his Neighbor, according to that pattern which in his
own breaſt he ſhapes to his Neighbor to perform unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
hee will do no injury, becauſe he would <hi>receive no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury;</hi>
and this is the ground of that Command or Precept
of our Saviour, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbor as thy ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Rule is, <hi>Whatſoever yee would that men ſhould
do unto you, even do yee unto them, Mat.</hi> 7. 12. and this rule ſtirs
us up to all beneficence, and doing good to our Neighbor:
for as to prevent injuring another man, a man ſhould aske
himſelf, would I that another man ſhould do to me, as I
am about to do unto him? and ſo, <hi>love</hi> to <hi>himſelf</hi> will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
hatred to another; So to confer favors, and to do
good unto another, a man ſhould aske himſelf, would I
require this boon, this favor, this good turn from another, if
I ſtood in need of it as my Neighbor doth, and I were in his
condition? and would the granting, or doing this favor, be
moſt acceptable to me, and lay an eternal obligation upon
me? Hence love to a mans <hi>Self,</hi> will kindle his bowels of
compaſſion to his <hi>Brother,</hi> and will diſpoſe him willingly to
do that good unto another, which, if occaſion ſerved, he
would willingly <hi>receive</hi> from another.</p>
            <p>Theſe men of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> regulate themſelves in all their
actions here charged upon them, and fully proved by oath
of men of undoubted integrity, neither by the one Rule nor
by the other; for they <hi>do</hi> not onely <hi>do</hi> thoſe <hi>injuries</hi> and <hi>wrongs</hi>
which they would not <hi>take,</hi> but they deny thoſe favors
which they would, if occaſion ſerved, willingly receive; Nay,
they do not onely deny to do thoſe favors themſelves, which
not onely by the <hi>Law of Christian Charity,</hi> but even by the
<hi>Dictate of Nature,</hi> and <hi>common Humanity</hi> they are bound to
perform, but they <hi>binder</hi> and <hi>deter</hi> thoſe that would do them,
and violently proſecute, fine and impriſon thoſe who have

<hi>Chriſt, Doth our Law</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>judge any man before it hear

way of proceeding in Judicatory is moſt repugnant both to
the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> as you ſee in the <hi>Romans Law,</hi> and alſo
to the Law of God, which poſitively determines, <hi>One wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſhall not riſe up againſt a man for any iniquity, or any ſin that
he ſinneth, At the mouth of two or three witneſſes ſhall the matter be
eſtabliſhed, Deut.</hi> 19. 15. And if God would not have any
man to be condemned in any Judicatory by the teſtimony of
<hi>one witneſs,</hi> but by the joynt atteſtation of two or three at
leaſt, as is evident by this Text of Scripture, and by
many concurrent places of divine Writ, as <hi>Numb. 35. 30.
Deut. 17. 6. Mat. 18. 16. John 8. 17. Heb. 10. 28. 2 Cor.</hi> 13. 1.
How much leſs would God approve of ſuch tyrannical
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:58145:103"/>
proceedings to condemn a man without any witneſs at all,
or ever permitting the perſon accuſed to take up an <hi>Apology</hi>
or juſt defence for himſelf.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Forcing men to ſwear againſt themſelves,</hi> (pag. 60.
72. 86. 87. 88. 91. 92. 103.) How highly were the hearts of
this Nation inflamed? what indignation did they conceive
againſt the practices both of the <hi>Star Chamber,</hi> and <hi>High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</hi>
heretofore (pag. 87.) as laying an unſupportable
yoak upon the necks of the people by the tender of the <hi>Oath
ex Officio?</hi> Hath all the Nation freed themſelves from
this bondage by a good Law, ſo that elſewhere no man
is compelled to teſtifie againſt himſelfe, or where other
witneſſes fail; inforced to accuſe himſelf? And muſt they
onely that come under the Juriſdiction of the Magiſtrates of
<hi>Newcaſtle</hi> remain inſlaved under the ſame bondage? Is this
Tyranny lawful at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> that is exploded and caſt off
every where elſe?</p>
            <p>Nay, that which infinitely heightens their oppreſſion and
wickedneſs, is this, That thoſe Reaſons which were alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

Joſh. 7. 19. was alleged as an inſtance to juſtifie their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
