            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, I haue here preſented you with an Hiſtorie out of French into English, containing the life and glorious actes of Scanderbeg King of Epyre, a Prince no leſſe admired in his life, then memorable after his death. I neede not commend vnto you, eyther the excellencie of the Hiſtorie, or the worthineſſe of the partie: for that both the one and the other are ſufficient to commend themſelues, and the shadow of my prayſes will but eclipſe the brightneſſe of their deſerts. Notwithſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may be expected that I should ſay ſomewhat, giue me leaue to ſpeake what I thinke, though I cannot thinke what I ought to ſpeake. Firſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore touching Scanderbeg, ſo exquiſite was his skill and experience in the art and ſcience militarie, ſo excellent and heroicall was his cariage and gouernment amongeſt his ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, amongſt his ſubiects, and towards his very enemies: ſo amiable and louely were his vertues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo vnſpeakable and vnmatchable were many of his qualities, ſo honorable and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious were all his actions, and ſo extraordinarie was his fortune in the multitude and rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his victories, that it may be a queſtion whether was greater his vertue or his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. The one was rare, the other admirable, and both together haue exempted him from compariſon: in ſo much, that if Hanniball the Carthaginian the ſcourge of Rome, and Scipio the Romaine the plague of Carthage, were now liuing, to reuiue their old diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, who should be reputed the beſt Captaine: I doubt not but each of them would giue Scanderbeg the garland, at leaſtwiſe they would acknowledge him (if not ſuperiour to all) yet inferiour to none, and equall to the worthieſt. If we compare his ſmall meanes with his mightie exploites, you will ſay they were wonderfull, if you conſider his policies and fine ſtratageames, you will ſay they were ſingular: if you reſpect his corporall giftes and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nature her ſelfe will ſay she was prodigall in gracing him, hauing made him as comely as Edgar Atheling, who was called Englands darling, and as vnpenetrable as Achilles, whom no weapon could faſten on. If you regard his fortune, fortune her ſelfe will tell you, that she was fond ouer him. For in him onely she shewed a change of her nature, which being vſually changeable and inconſtant to all men mortall, yet to him continued conſtant and vnchangeable. As for his vertues, Oh how they shine most glorious as the ſunne beames, dazeling the eyes of the beholders with the excellencie of their obiect. Looke into his life, and let this Hiſtorie be the glaſſe to shew you his perfections, you shall finde, that for warineſſe and prudence, he was comparable to Fabius Maximus, who by tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing repayred the eſtate of Rome almoſt ruinated: for loue to his natiue countrie, he was another Camillus, who being exiled by his ingrate citizens, yet reſcued them from the Gaules. For diſcipline he was equall to Manlius, whoſe ſeueritie to his owne ſonne hath made him euer famous. Couragious as Hector that neuer turned backe to his enemies, boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and courteous as Caeſar, who by giuing, forgiuing, and relieuing, made himſelfe way to the Romaine Empire: mercifull as Traian, who neuer ſigned Bill for the execution of malefactors but he bedewed it with his teares: deare to his ſubiects and ſouldiers as Tytus, who was termed the delight and the Iewell of the world. Alexander the glorie of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon, got the name of Great amongst the Greekes, becauſe he ouercame the Orient like a tempest: Pompey the ioy of the Romaine Nobilitie, had the name of Great giuen him by
<pb facs="tcp:13368:4"/>
the Romaines, becauſe he purged the ſeas infested with Pyrats, and becauſe he ſtoode for the common libertie: Charlemaine the honour of the French was entytled Great becauſe he brake the force and power of the Sarracens. Gonſaluo the pride of the Spaniards and Italians was called the great Captaine, becauſe he extorted the kingdome of Naples from the Frenchmen. As iuſtly may the Epyrots vaunt of their Scanderbeg to be the glorie, the honour, the pride, and the ioy of Albanie, ſeeing the Turkes themſelues his ſworne and mortall enemies haue giuen and attributed the name of Great vnto him, and ſeeing the greatneſſe of his exploits doe teſtifie that the name and title of Great is no greater then his deſerts. Nay all Europe may worthily acknowledge him to be as great as the greateſt: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his conqueſt in Aſia and Europe vnder Amurath, the ſtrange recouerie of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and of the libertie of his countrie, which he purged from the Infidels: his often and wonderfull victories atcheeued againſt infinite and huge armies, and the continuall courſe of his life, and of all his actions doe shew apparantly, that he was the glorie and onely ſtaie of his owne countrie, the ſole protectour of the common libertie, a bulwarke to Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, a champion for the religion, the paragon of that age, and the wonder of poſteritie: a terror to his enemies whileſt he liued, and adored by them after his death. Pardon me (my maſters) if I be ſomewhat immoderate or ſuperſtitious in admiring his excellencie, for what almoſt can there be in any man, that was not aboundantly in our Scanderbeg? ſo many were his perfections, and ſo few his imperfections, as it may iuſtly be imagined, that God created him as a mirror for the world rather to wonder at, then any way poſſibly to be matched, and yet moſt worthy of all men to be imitated.</p>
            <p>Now by the excellencie of the perſon here repreſented, the worthineſſe of this hiſtorie may eaſily be imagined, for where the ſubiect is ſo rare and notable, the eſtimat of the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie muſt needes be made correſpondent and agreeable. I will not compare it with the beſt that haue beene written, but this I dare auerre, that therein is litle or nothing wanting which in a hiſtorie is thought needfull. The ornaments of an hiſtorie are, elegancie of the ſtile, truth of the reports, varietie of the diſcourſe, and the profitableneſſe of the matter. For the ſtile, howſoeuer this historie may ſeeme defectiue, it is not much materiall: for though it want the grace of elegant and fine phraſes to make it pleaſaunt to curious eares and to daintie appetites: yet for all other the accomplements of a good and perfect hiſtorie I thinke it may go beyond the moſt: if it compare not with the beſt: touching the trueth thereof, diuerſe circumſtances and arguments do proue it to be without controllment, The age and time wherein it was firſt written: the conſent of ſucceeding times which haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it without reproofe, and the teſtimonies of ſundrie authors who haue recorded the moſt notable and ſtrangeſt accidents contained in this hiſtorie. For the varietie thereof to procure delight, I appeale to your owne iudgements when you haue read it. And I doubt not but you will confeſſe: that you haue found few hiſtories or none, more copious, more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable and more delightfull. For profit likewiſe: in many pointes it will ſhew it ſelfe to be excellent, and you can turne to no part through, but you ſhall finde matter of benefite. Hence may the ſage Philoſopher and prudent Poletist deriue all or the moſt precepts of the Arte and ſcience militarie. Herein may both the expert Martialiſt and the ſimple ſouldier ſee the excellencie and perfection of his calling and profeſsion: the benefit of good order and martiall diſcpline: and out of the <hi>Idea</hi> of Scanderbeg his actions, may they behold (as it were) the anatomie and ſhape vnto themſelues, the image both of an expert Generall and an abſolute ſouldier. Here may Princes and great perſons behold the bright ſhining luſtre of many royall and heroicall vertues, making their names glorious in the eye of the world, their power fearefull and terrible to their enemies, and their perſons deere and gratious to their ſubiects: here may they take a view of thoſe pernitious vices &amp; enormities of thoſe rash &amp; inconſiderat aſſertions which make them odious to God, hatefull to men, diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:13368:4"/>
in their eſtates, and moſt wretched and miſerable euen in the greatnes of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. In ſome, ſuch is the varietie, the veritie, the profit and the excellencie of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: that there is no eſtate, degree or calling, but may find therein ſomewhat to admire at, much to delight in, and moſt things to imitat and to put in practiſe and execution.</p>
            <p>It reſteth now (my maſters) that you make that eſtimate and account of it, which both the excellencie of Scanderbeg his vertues, and the worthineſſe of the hiſtorie doe require and merit: and that you meaſure the good will and painefull labours both of the authors, and of the tranſlator by their diſpoſitions affecting your good and benefit, and not by any ſiniſter ſingularitie of your miſdeeming conceipt. For if you be not too ingrate and iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the memorie of a Prince ſo well deſeruing, if you shew not your ſelues more then barbarous in contemning a monument of ſo great reckoning: or if you be not too auſtere and rigorous in your cenſures: you cannot but graciouſly accept the acquaintance of this hiſtorie: you will friendly welcome the rare example of Scanderbeg his peereleſſe vertues and his ſurpaſsing fortune: and laſt of all, you will couer the imperfection of this worke (if you find any) with the vaile of your ſelfe-gracing courteſie.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE OF THE FRENCH AVTHOR TO THE NO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BILITIE OF FRANCE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Maiſters: If we will exactly weigh and conſider the imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie of our natiuitie: we ſhall find (according to the obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Plinie:</hi>) that nature was verie ſparie and niggardly in our creation: becauſe that man (who was borne to haue the Seigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orie and Lordſhip ouer all other creatures) commeth into the world verie naked, fraile and poore, in compariſon of them. She hath beſtowed vpon all beaſtes euen in their originall and firſt beginning ſtrength, wherewith to helpe them, veſtures wherewith to couer them, weapons to defend them, paſture to nouriſh and feed them. But how hath ſhe dealt with man? he commeth naked out of his mothers wombe, weake and feeble, and not able to ſuſtaine and helpe himſelfe: man alone of all other creatures is borne without knowledge and hath nothing but what is taught him: he is fit for nothing, he is not able ſo much as to go or to ſpeake, and when he hath continued a long time learning and getting of experience, and when he is come (as the Philoſopher ſaith) to his owne naturall: he applieth himſelfe to nothing but to vice and ſenſualitie: and he remaineth ſtill (notwithſtanding all his paines and trauelles) inferior to the brute beaſtes: who on the contrarie euen by the inſtinct of nature do giue themſelues to follow that which appertaineth to their function, and which is proper and peculiar vnto them.</p>
            <p>This conceipt of the compariſon of the impuiſſance and infirmitie of mankind, putteth me in minde of an olde <hi>Italian</hi> prouerbe, which is: That it had bene expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and needfull for men either to be borne ſage and wiſe, or to be borne twice. For if we were borne wiſe, we ſhould eſchew and auoide the inconueniences of this life, againſt the which by ignorance we do daily and howerly ſtumble: or at leaſtwiſe in the courſe of our ſecond life, we ſhould put that in practiſe which we had learned in our firſt life: and we ſhould not walke blindfolded in the darknes of error as we now do, comming into this world depriued and deſtitute of the light of wiſedome which <hi>Solomon</hi> demaunded of God before all earthly things whatſoeuer.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding on the contrarie, if we do marke and conſider the excellencie of man: we ſhall ſee that in ſtead of theſe goodly corporall faculties wherein other creatures are his ſuperiours, God hath gratiouſly endowed him with a ſingular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence of that part of his nature which is intellectuall and capable of doctrine, and that is our ſpirit, which of it ſelfe is diuine and celeſtiall: and whereas by meanes of her priſon and earthly tabernacle, it is made rude, ſauage, and out of taſte: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tempered, reformed, and faſhioned by the fauour and ciuilitie of good artes and ſciences: it eſtrangeth vs as farre from the nature of creatures vnreaſonable: as it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs to approach and draw nigh to the reſemblance of the diuine Image.</p>
            <p>Seing therefore all men are by nature both capable of knowledge, and haue a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie impoſed vpon them to ſeeke after learning; the gentle man of all others hath
<pb facs="tcp:13368:5"/>
moſt reaſon to apply his mind thereunto: for that he exceeding all other perſons in dignitie of bloud, and in the gifts, graces, and qualities of nature, and being in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard thereof the ſooner called to degrees of honour, and to the managing of great matters, he ought alſo to beautifie and enoble his minde and vnderſtanding, and to make it more &amp; more glorious by the knowledge of good letters, eſpecially of good and worthy hiſtories: for in truth there is nothing ſo louely, beautiful or amiable, but the ſtudy of hiſtories wil plentifully ſupply any man with the knowledge therof, that ſhal delite to be conuerſant, and to exerciſe himſelf in them. This bringeth her follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to be priuie counſellers to kings and princes: this preferreth them to the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of kingdomes and common weales: to the moſt honorable eſtates &amp; offices of the warres, and to the gouernments of prouinces: this teacheth vs to be wiſe, at the coſt of others. To be briefe (as <hi>Cicero</hi> well calleth them) Hiſtories are the teſtimony of times, the light of truth, the life of memorie, the Ladie and miſtreſte of life, and the meſſenger of antiquitie, of the which who ſo is ignorant, may iuſtly be accompted as a ſtranger in his owne countrey. But I will not proceed any farther in her praiſes: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I will encourage you to be familiar with her: for I ſee (God be thanked for it) that ſhe hath good entertainment generally, and is well receiued &amp; cheriſhed amongſt you: that you are content to beſtow a good part of your honeſt leiſure in her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. Yet thus much let me tell you by the way, &amp; vpon occaſion of this diſcourſe: that foraſmuch as the principall and moſt ordinary profeſſion of Frenchmen is to followe armes, and yet they take litle or no care or pains at all to ſtudy &amp; know the lawes and rights depending vpon the profeſſion of armes: I deſire therefore, that the ſtudie and reading of hiſtories (which repreſenteth vnto vs manifold exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of ſo many migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie armies well gouerned, and of ſo many Captaines and ſouldiers which haue bene moſt curious and preciſe obſeruers of the ſtatutes and ordinances of the Art militarie) may prouoke and allure you alſo to follow more religiouſly &amp; carefully this ancient diſcipline, and that you would conforme your ſelues to the practiſe thereof: whereby thoſe famous and worthy perſonages haue purchaſed to themſelues endles &amp; eternall honor, to their Chieftaines and leaders innumerable triumphs and victories, and to their countrey mighty Empires, and Monarchies of infinite greatneſſe. What was it that reſerued and freed the name and memory of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> of the <hi>Greekes,</hi> &amp; of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> from the vngratefull ſilence and the iniurious obliuion of deuouring time? What hath made their glorie and renowme to be ſo famous euen till this day? What was it that ſpread abroad the glorious and immortall name of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> euen to the vtmoſt bounds and limits of this earthly frame? What made them ſo fearfull and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible euen to the proud and inuincible <hi>Romanes:</hi> that vpon euery rumor made to the Senate that the <hi>Gaules</hi> were on foote, they ſpeedily had recourſe to the Dictatorſhip, as vnto a ſacred anker in the moſt tempeſtuous ſtormes and perils of their eſtate? Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly it was not the ſupernatural force of their bodies: it was not the infinit number of their ſquadrons, but the onely exact, ſtrict, and rigorous obſeruation of the lawes and diſcipline of warre.</p>
            <p>Thus did that famous Conqueror <hi>Godfrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Bouillon:</hi> thus did our generous and Chriſtian <hi>Argonauts,</hi> and infinit others in times paſt make themſelues way vnto the heauens, &amp; purchaſed immortal fame vpon the earth. What hath made the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins</hi> &amp; the <hi>Turks</hi> to grow to that reputation and honor by armes? What hath made them inheritors almoſt of all the Empire of the <hi>Greeks &amp; Romanes,</hi> but this only, that they did firſt imitate and ſucceed them in their good orders and diſcipline? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they only of all others at this day are the ſole obſeruers, and they alone may iuſtly vau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that they haue the true diſcipline in price &amp; regard: they (I ſay) only may arroga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

this vnto themſelues: for I know not any one nation beſides them, who make anie account of the ſame. There is no care had now a dayes amongſt ſouldiers and men at armes, of any rules, precepts or pollicie of warres: we loue rather to learne the duties of the field by experience, and by the euent &amp; hazard of our owne proper perill, then by reaſon and diſcipline: and therein do we fulfill the old prouerbe; In loſſe is lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. But (in my opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) this is but a bad maxime: for the courſe of our life is briefe &amp; ſhort, and vſe and experience without reading requireth too long a time to furniſh vs with all thoſe things which are neceſſary for the perfection of our experience. But ſtudy &amp; reading of hiſtories being ioyned to experience, is ſufficient in a ſmal time to aduance, to quicke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to refine, &amp; to perfect our iudgement. For (as <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Comines</hi> hath<note place="margin">Saying of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip of Comines.</note> ſaid very wiſely) A man may know more touching the practiſe of deeds of armes by 3 moneths reading in one good booke, then 20 men ſhalbe able to know by the eye &amp; experience, if they liue in ſeuerall ages ſucceſſiuely one after another. I returne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to my matter: and I ſay, that this ſcience and practiſe being moſt needfull and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for our nation (whoſe profeſſion is to follow the warres<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) the ſpeedieſt and ſhorteſt courſe, and the beſt way and meanes to attaine to the true and perfect skill of armes, is to conſort and to marrie themſelues to the ſtudie and reading of hiſtories.</p>
            <p>The conſideration hereof hath moued me to communicate vnto you a hiſtory, out of the which (I hope) you ſhall gather no leſſe frute and profit, then pleaſure and recreation. Howbeit I knowe there are fewe or no good Hiſtoriographers auncient or moderne, domeſticall or ſtraungers, but they are publiſhed in our language by the vertuous labors of many learned &amp; rare ſpirits amongſt the <hi>French:</hi> neuertheles, in this our hiſtorie here imparted vnto you, firſt of all in reading the haughty aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and valiant exploites of an age ſo nearely conioyned to this of ours, falling in a manner within the time and knowledge euen of our grand-fathers: we haue good cauſe to reioice &amp; to glorie in the ſame, no leſſe then the world hath euer accuſtomed to make a benefit, and to attribute vnto themſelues the honor of great triumphes, and the glorie of their owne age and times. Beſides, here ſhalbe repreſented vnto you, not the deteſtable and bloudie effects of our owne miſeries, troubles, and ſeditions: nor the hatefull conſpiracies of ſubiects againſt their Prince and countrie: nor the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble maſſacres of friends and fellow citizens: of children againſt their parents, of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers fleſhed againſt their naturall brethren: nor of husbands againſt their wiues: you ſhall not heare in this diſcourſe the piteous cries and lamentations of wiues and maidens violated: you ſhall not ſee here the exceſſe of ſacrileges, of burnings, nor the rapine and ſpoile of the goods of friends and allies: but you ſhall reade of a moſt holy, a iuſt, and an honorable warre: of armes lawfully vndertaken, for the defence both of the Chriſtian, and of the ciuill libertie, againſt the Turkes and circumciſed miſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, the ſworne enemies of Ieſus Chriſt: you ſhall ſee their townes maintained and defended, their countrie preſerued and protected by the armes of their proper peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and naturall inhabitants: here ſhall you behold the image of a Prince moſt reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, of a warrior moſt magnanimous, armed with faith and zeale incredible: his ſouldiers faithfull, louing and obedient: here ſhall you trace out ſo perfect an obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of militarie diſcipline, that their notable victories and exploits will appeare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you worthie of wonder and admiration. All this ſhall you ſee in this hiſtorie, of the life of <hi>George Caſtriot,</hi> ſurnamed by the Turks, <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> which is, <hi>Alexander</hi> the Lord, or the Great, King of <hi>Albanie:</hi> whoſe immortall name is worthie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all contradiction, to be conſecrated to the temple of Memorie, farre aboue all other Knightes, and champions of the Leuant, whoſe honourable actes haue made them to be recommended for the defence of the faith of Chriſt againſt the
<pb facs="tcp:13368:6"/>
deteſtable and curſed ſect of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> For it ſeemeth that God had a ſpeciall will and purpoſe to marke him with all laudable qualities and prerogatiues: as faith, religion, ſtrength of bodie, comelineſſe of perſon, dexteritie of ſpirit, the practiſe and skill of armes: all which were accompanied with ſo wonderfull and vnſpeakeable good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, that it may be iuſtly auerred, that his deedes did ſurmount his deſtinies. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription whereof I haue according to the truth and ſinceritie of an hiſtorie, drawen and deriued out of the writings of thoſe that haue intreated of them: and ſpecially out of the Latine hiſtorie of <hi>Marin Barletus</hi> Prieſt, borne in <hi>Scutarie</hi> or <hi>Scodra,</hi> a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in <hi>Epire,</hi> whom we haue choſen and followed as a principall example and pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne, and as an Authour who hath bene reputed moſt diligent and ſincere, and moſt graue and ſententious. In regard whereof he hath purchaſed to him ſelfe a place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt the moſt notable and famous hiſtoriographers of the Latines, that haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in theſe latter ages.</p>
            <p>This Hiſtorie do I nowe impart vnto you (my Maiſters) humbly intreating you, that if ouer much temeritie haue cauſed me to forget my ſelfe in taking vppon me a taske which ſurpaſſeth and exceedeth the feebleneſſe of my ſpirit, you would impute the blame thereof to the readineſſe of my good will and affection, which I haue to do you ſeruice: and that you would pleaſe to receiue this my trauell as gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly as I haue made offer thereof vnto your curteſies with my beſt deuotion and abilitie.</p>

Howbeit I do impute their error vnto this, that they being ſtraungers to the Eſtate and affaires of Epire, and hauing intelligence of the deedes of Scanderbeg onely by heare ſay and by report, they could not ſo truly and exactly ſet downe the truth of matters as they are here deliuered in this Hiſtorie by the Latine Author: who being natiue of the ſame countrey with Scanderbeg, and liuing in the ſame age and time that he did, is to be reputed the beſt witneſſe and moſt perfect reporter of his deedes.</p>

               <p>AMurath the ſecond of that name, King of the Turkes, reſtoreth the glorie and eſtate of the Turkish Empire, being greatlie decaied by the ouerthrow and captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his Grandfather Baiazeth by the armes of Tamberlaine. Iohn Caſtriot reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in Epyre: His linage, vertues, and goodlie iſſue: The birth of George his youngeſt ſonne, and the ſtrange ſignes prognoſticating his future glorie and greatneſse. Amurath warreth vpon Iohn Caſtriot: who being wearie of the warres ſueth for peace, and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his ſonnes in hoſtage. Amurath cauſeth them to be circumciſed, chaungeth their names, and George is named Scanderbeg. The manner of the Turkish circumciſion, and their orders of prieſthood. The education, vertues, and preferment of Scanderbeg vnder Amurath: His notable ſeruices and good fortune in the warres: He fighteth two combats in the Turkish Court. Iohn Caſtriot the father of Scanderbeg dieth. Amurath vſurpeth his eſtate, and poiſoneth all his ſonnes except Scanderbeg, whoſe excellent vertues and the enuie of the Courtiers cauſeth Amurath to haue him in ielouzie and ſuſpition, and to practiſe by ſundrie plots his death and deſtruction. Amurath warreth vpon the Deſpot of Miſia, and expelleth him his Eſtate: who is aided by Vladiſlaus king of Hungarie. Scanderbeg and Carambey are ſent with an armie againſt the Hungarians: Scanderbeg reuolteth, Carambey and the Turkes are ouerthrowen by the Hungarians in the battell of Moruua. Scanderbeg by a pollicie ſeizeth vpon Croy: and recouereth it and the reſt of his fathers eſtate. The Princes, Nobles, and Commons of Epyre ioyne with Scanderbeg, and by their aide diuerſe of the chiefeſt and ſtrongeſt holdes of Epyre are regayned from the Turkes. Sfetygrade is beſieged by Scanderbeg, who maketh a roade into Macedonie, and ſpoyleth the Turkish territories.</p>

For notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the greateſt and mightieſt Monarchies in the earth, haue had their originall from moſt vile, baſe, and obſcure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings: yet hath the diuine Prouidence vphelde them in ſo ſtrange a manner, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:13368:9"/>
hath made them to proſper with ſo long continuance: that neither the ſundry aſſaults and trauerſes of vnconſtant Fortune, nor the attempts of any humaine forces, haue had the power to abridge any one day of their date and terme limitted and prefixed by the diuine ordinance. Of this we haue a ſufficient, though a lamentable teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, by that inſolent Empire of the Turkiſh Monarchie, (if we may ſo name that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate puiſſance of thoſe perſons) who by a iuſt and diuine iudgement, and for the manifeſtation of our ingratitude and ſecuritie, hath obtained at this day the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute dominion and commaund of <hi>Aſia, Afrike,</hi> and a good part of <hi>Europe:</hi> conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that Empire, which erſt was held holy, ſacred, and religious, into a fortreſſe of open blaſphemies, and into a filthie ſtall of prophane Miſcreants, the profeſſed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the ſonne of God.</p>
            <p>This people being growen famous by the conqueſt of <hi>Siria</hi> and the leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> and hauing extended their boundes on this ſide the ſea of Helleſpont, and hauing planted their Empire, and ſet it on foote within <hi>Europe,</hi> and all Greece being ſubdued vnder their obeiſance: made the <hi>Miſians, Bulgarians,</hi> and <hi>Albanians,</hi> the <hi>Valachians,</hi> the <hi>Hungarians</hi> and <hi>Sclauonians</hi> to quake and tremble vnder their victorious armes.

And in the yeare next following, the mightie<note place="margin">1397.</note> king of the <hi>Tartarians</hi> the great <hi>Tamberlain</hi> (termed the wrath of the heauens and the ſcourge of that corrupt age:) and <hi>Baiazeth</hi> the firſt then Emperour of the Turkes, encountring ech other in the confines of <hi>Armenia</hi> at the foote of the mountaine of the ſtarre; (where ſomtimes <hi>Pompey</hi> obtained a famous victorie againſt <hi>Mithridates</hi>) euenthere did the Turkes ſuſtaine ſo wonderfull and grieuous an ouerthrowe, by the great ſlaughter and diſcomfiture of their forces, and the perpetuall impriſonment of their Emperor: that the glorie of their Empire was for a long time diſcontinued, and there remained not almoſt any tract or ſhewe of their former pride and pompe, or of their puiſſance or maieſtie. After <hi>Baiazeth</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Amurath</hi> Nephew vnto him by one of his ſonnes, who in that time of their fathers calamity, being but infants, were then preſerued aliue, partly by the ouerſight of the Greekes, and partly by the deuiſions and diſſentions of the Latines, or (it may be) by the permiſſion of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinies: which reſerued them for the future plague &amp; miſeries of Chriſtendom. This <hi>Amurath</hi> in proceſſe of time, not without many ſeditions of his owne ſubiects, &amp; by great bloudſhed by ciuill warres (for he ſlew his own Vncle <hi>Muſtapha</hi> in battell) by good happe obtained the Empire, &amp; reſtored their Turkiſh Monarchie: and was the firſt amongſt his anceſtors that reeſtabliſhed their good fortune.

In thoſe daies (for to aſcend beyong thoſe times to the firſt beginning of ſtrange Empires, or to mount higher in recounting forreign affaires is a matter needleſſe and ſuperfluous) in that age I ſay, amongſt many other Princes, which then commaunded in <hi>Epyre,</hi> now named <hi>Albanie, Iohn Caſtriot,</hi> a man of no
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:13368:9"/>

            <p>This <hi>Iohn</hi> (of whom we are now in diſcourſe) farre ſurmounted all his predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors<note place="margin">Iohn Caſtriot the father of Scanderbeg.</note> in prudence, grauitie, and magnanimitie, and being of an hardie and inuincible courage, he did excell in all other vertuous qualities: and eſpecially (if that may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port any excellencie) the corporall beautie, and the comlineſſe of his perſon was very rare and ſingular. His wife alſo named <note n="*" place="margin">Voiſaua the mother of Scanderbeg. Alias.</note> 
               <hi>Voiſaua</hi> (a woman worthy of ſuch a husband) was much renowmed both in that ſhe was the daughter of the noble king of the <note n="*" place="margin">Lord of Pologne which is a part of Macedonie and Bulgarie.</note> 
               <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullians:</hi> as alſo for her beautie &amp; wiſdome, and for the excellencie of her ſpirit, farre ſurpaſſing that of other women. And it may be, that ſhe merited no leſſe commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by reaſon of that goodly iſſue and poſteritie which diſcended from her: a thing which hath made many women glorious, and maketh them worthy of ſpeciall praiſe and commendation. For ſome do hold that ſhe was the mother of nine children, fiue of them daughters; to wit, <hi>Mara, Iella, Angellina, Vlaica</hi> and <hi>Mamiſa:</hi> and the other male children: namely, <hi>Repoſius, Staniſius, Conſtantine</hi> and <hi>George.</hi> The youngeſt of<note place="margin">George Caſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot ſurnamed Scanderbeg.</note> them all was <hi>George:</hi> to whom afterwards (as ſhalbe elſewhere deliuered) the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Turkes gaue the name of <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ere we proceede further, I hold it not amiſſe to ſet downe that which (as I haue read) was both by prodigious ſignes and wonders foreſhewed, and by many perſons proguoſticated touching the future glorie and renowme of this famous <hi>Epyrot:</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit<note place="margin">Scanderbeg his future glorie and renowme prognoſticated by diuerſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious ſignes and tokens.</note> I doubt not, but there be many who will make a ieſt and mockerie thereof as of an olde wiues tale, and a matter meerely fabulous. Some ſay that his mother vpon his conception did dreame, that ſhee had brought foorth ſo great and huge a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, that the ſame hauing wellneere couered the whole Empire, did ſtretch out her head ouer the boundes of <hi>Turkie,</hi> and did deuour and ſwallowe them vppe with her bloudie throate: dipping her taile in the ſea towardes the coaſtes of the Chriſtians: and eſpecially towardes the confines of the <hi>Venetians.</hi> This dreame being recounted vnto her husband, he conſidering the qualitie of the caſe, helde it a vaine and friuolous thing to ſeeke out the meaning and ſecret thereof, either by the ſuperſtitious viewe of the entrailes of beaſtes, or by ſeeking to the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of <hi>Apollo</hi> for the interpretation thereof: but hee comforted his wife with an incomparable kinde of ioye, giuing her to vnderſtande by an euident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture: That of her ſhoulde bee borne a perſonage of that excellencie, that ſhould make himſelfe renowmed by armes and warre-like exploites: who ſhould be a grieuous and heauie enemie to the Turkes: a happie Captaine and fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate leader to the Chriſtians: a true defender of the faith of Chriſt: and ouer and aboue, one that ſhould during his whole life, beare great honour and reuerence to the ſtate of <hi>Venice.</hi> The hope and expectation of the carefull father, and of others was in nothing fruſtrate. For the infant being come into the worlde, did exceede farre and beyonde all compariſon that which was preſaged of him. For on his right arme appeared the forme of a ſworde ſo naturally imprinted, as if it had beene engrauen by the handes of ſome cunning and artificiall workeman.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:13368:10"/>
A notable and euident ſigne of the reputation which hee ſhoulde purchaſe by armes. O the notable bountie of nature which euen in our natiuity doth giue vs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſements and in our bodies doth imprint the enſignes and tokens of that which is to enſue &amp; happen vnto vs. This infant being growen to a lad of ſome yeres (aſſoone as his age would permit him) began to exerciſe his bow and other weapons, giuing ſuch proofe of his forwardnes in the firſt rudiments and apprentiſhip (as it were) of his tender yeares, that the ſignes of his future vertue and valure did eaſily diſcouer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in the eye of ech man ſufficiently: and in his youthfull race alſo there did from thenceforth appeare in him more and more, ſuch an ardent deſire to frame his life in goodneſſe and vertue; and ſo comely and elegant a cariage in his behauiour, with a certaine ſhewe of religion, euen then promiſing a reuerence and regarde vnto the faith of Chriſt; that all men had their eyes and their regard fixed vpon him. He one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was the man whom both father and mother, whom his brethren, and the reſidue of the inhabitants of that countrie did with a ſecret kinde of aſtoniſhment euen ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and wonder at. Of him were all their diſcourſes: of him did the people mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure in all places as of the moſt rare and excellent paragon of that age. Ouer and aboue theſe preſages of his fortune, he had euen by nature a certaine goodly and ſtately feature of bodie, which did (as it were) ſeaſon and grace all his actions. But of a graffe ſo likely and towarde (if it be lawfull ſo to terme him) the deſtinies did not permit the doubtfull parents to gather any frute anſwerable to their deſires. For after that <hi>Amurath</hi> had ranged <hi>Greece</hi> vnder the yoke of his obeiſance, and had turned his Enſignes againſt <hi>Macedonie,</hi> hauing afflicted it with a long and tedious warre, and reduced it to the point of extreame miſerie: <hi>Iohn Caſtriot</hi> being wearied with the trauell of continuall warres, and weakened by the ceaſeleſſe diſcommodities of thoſe troubles: was in the end conſtrained to entreat and ſue for peace: the which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained vpon condition, that he ſhould deliuer all his ſonnes to the Turke in hoſtage. A more greeuous and intollerable ſeruitude, or a more deadly &amp; ignominious bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage could they not haue impoſed vpon any parents. For what ſolace or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort could they reape by ſuch a peace? and what contentment could they take of their dignitie and eſtate, which was preſerued by ſuch meanes, ſo lamentable and grieuous? Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding what is it which the wretched deſire of life, and the greedie thirſt of raigne and Empire will not perſwade timorous and fearefull men to yeeld vnto? So fared it with theſe vnfortunate old folkes, that they loued rather to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit themſelues to the mercie of a moſt felonous and falſe enemie, and vtterly to depriue themſelues of ſo pretious pledges: then to attende with ſome delay the extreame ruine of their fortunes, which were euen then tumbling to decay and confuſion.</p>
            <p>Thus was <hi>George</hi> (together with his brethren) deliuered in hoſtage to the Turke,<note place="margin">George Caſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot deliuered in hoſtage to the great Turke.</note> cauſing farre greater ſorrowe and lamentation for him alone then for all the others both in publique and in priuate. All this notwithſtanding, the father was nothing deceiued of that hope which he had erſt conceiued of his ſonne. But at the time of his departure from him, after many &amp; often kiſſes and ſweet embracements, he caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf vpon him as more pitying his misfortune the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any of the reſt: and daily &amp; deuoutly did he pray vnto God; that the attent &amp; expectation which he had in him, might not become fruſtrate &amp; in vaine. And euen amongſt the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people there wanted not ſome, who (wiſhing vnto the lad the yeares &amp; ſtrength of mans eſtate with long life) did ſeeme euen to propheſie that <hi>Amurath</hi> ſhould in him nouriſh a domeſticall enemie, and the confuſion of his owne houſe and family. Theſe young Princes were no ſooner conueyed to <hi>Ottoman:</hi> but they foorthwith felt the firſt frutes and<note place="margin">Ottoman the ſurname of the great Turke.</note> proofe of his infidelitie, in that (violating the faith and promiſe which he had giuen
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:13368:10"/>
to their parents) he cauſed them ſpeedily to be circumciſed according to the lawe of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> The manner of which ceremonie (for that the knowledge thereof is not vnpleaſant) I hold it not impertinent in this place, briefely and particularly in ſome ſort to recite it. The Turkes doe herein obſerue a cuſtome and vſage not much<note place="margin">The Turkiſh ceremonie in their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.</note> differing from that of the Iewes, but onely in this one thing, which is added vnto it by the inſtitution of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> And that is: That before anie be circumcized, (if he be of reaſonable yeares and diſcretion) he is brought and placed in the middeſt of ſome great aſſembly: and there, by the commaundement of their Prieſt (whom they call Darniſſe,) he holdeth vp his forefinger, and lifteth vp his eyes towards heauen crying with a high voice, to the intent he may be eaſily heard and vnderſtood. <hi>La, Ila, La: Mehumet Reſulam.</hi> Which is to ſay, God, God, God alone, and <hi>Mahomet</hi> his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. After that, his foreskin being cut off by one skilfull and expert in that art, he is preſented to the people, and his firſt name being chaunged, they giue him a new. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly wherupon, all the ſtanders by both more and leſſe (if the party circumcized were either a Chriſtian or of any other religion) with exceeding great reioycing doe contribute money vnto him: and they magnifie him, kiſſe him, and embrace him: and from thenceforth, there is an houſe aſſigned for him of the publique charge, with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient prouiſions for him to liue vpon.</p>
            <p>But it ſhall not be amiſſe, if (digreſſing a litle from my matter) I diſcourſe ſomwhat<note place="margin">The diuers or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders &amp; eſtates of Prieſtes in the Turkiſh religion.</note> of the Turkiſh &amp; Mahometan religion: ſetting down both the ſtate &amp; diuerſitie of the orders, condition, and degrees of their Prieſts and religious perſons in that ſect &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. The firſt, and thoſe which are of the moſt ſtrict rule &amp; order amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are called Darniſſes: (of whom we haue before made ſome mention) &amp; we may compare<note place="margin">Darniſſes.</note> them to the Fryers obſeruants. But theſe (in the time of <hi>Baiazeth</hi> their king the ſonne of the laſt <hi>Mahomet</hi>) being detected of diuers foule offences &amp; enormities which they had committed: were by him baniſhed and exterminated: becauſe that (vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of deuotion &amp; holines) going about on begging, and retyring themſelues into deſerts and ſolitarie places, they did beſet the highwaies &amp; paſſages, by which mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, pilgrims &amp; trauellers were to paſſe: and eſpying occaſion &amp; oportunitie (no otherwiſe then as theeues &amp; robbers) they fell vpon them, wounded &amp; murdered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and then ſtripped them out of all that they had about them: The report wherof being come to the eares of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Prince, he was ſo highly prouoked and diſpleaſed therwithall, that he cauſed all of them (as is ſaid) to be cut in peeces &amp; to be deſtroyed, minding that the memory of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould haue bin for euer extinguiſhed. Next to theſe there are a ſecond ſort, whom the Turkes in their language call the <hi>Hozes:</hi> who may<note place="margin">Hozes.</note> well be likened to the Friers conuentuels. And laſt of all after them are the <hi>Talaſmans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Talaſmans.</note> whom they haue for their third order: and they do enioy the laſt place among them, and are like to the order of Prieſts Seculars. Beſides theſe three kinds, there be not any other orders, degrees, or manners of Prieſts or religious perſons, in the ſect or reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Turkes: but the whole charge and adminiſtration of the Prieſthoode, ceremonies and holy rites of their religion doth appertaine vnto them only. But now returne we to the ſubiect of this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe young Epirots hauing their firſt names changed at their circumcizion, had<note place="margin">George Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriot circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg, by the Turkes.</note> others giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> according to the cuſtom of that nation. <hi>George,</hi> (whether that it were by chance &amp; caſualtie, or were it, that there was in him a kind of appearance more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable then in the others, promiſing ſome thing which ſhould proue in him moſt rare &amp; excellent) was ſurnamed <hi>Scanderbeg:</hi> That is being interpreted, <hi>Alexander the Lord,</hi> or <hi>the Great.</hi> Ineſtimable &amp; great was the ioy which was made about <hi>Amurath</hi> at the circumciſion of theſe yong Epirots (as is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly ſeene with vs when any one

leauing the filth and infection of Iudaiſme doth embrace chriſtianitie and the light of ſaluation.) And they had ample and large allowance ordayned them for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences and maintenance.</p>
            <p>But the gentle diſpoſition which did naturally flouriſh and excell in <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi>

As his force en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by little and little with his yeares, ſo did he take delight in nothing more then to acquaint himſelfe with all thoſe vertuous exerciſes which were fit for the warres, without letting any one thing to ouerpaſſe him wherein he had not ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and inſight.

            <p>This was the occaſion, that the Sultan (not willing he ſhould any longer continue about him in the ſtate of a priuate perſon) determined to aduance him: and euen in<note place="margin">The firſt actes, ſeruices, and preferment of Scanderbeg.</note> the beginning he honoured him with the dignitie of Sanziack: (which is the ſecond degree after the Baſſaes, and is of greater of leſſer authoritie, according to the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of power which it pleaſeth the bountie and liberalitie of the Prince more or<note place="margin">Scanderbeg made Sanziac, with a charge of 5000. horſe.</note> leſſe to attribute and impart vnto it.)

            <p>As yet had not enuie (hatefull and repining at others vertue) aſſailed nor gotten hold on the heart of the Turkiſh Prince: and albeit both the maners and the ſtate of this noble <hi>Epirot,</hi> were a fit ſubiect for this humour and maladie to worke vpon: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his youth being as yet but of ſimple and meane experience, and his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in that age being not caried away with any immoderate, or greedie deſire of glorie: but hauing conceiued onely a kinde of liking &amp; loue of honor, it rather pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed vnto him the fauour, grace, and good will of all men. And therefore euen <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mureth</hi> himſelfe did ſingularly grace and honor him, both with good and gratious wordes, and with great and bountifull gifts and fauours. Short was the abode of this young gentleman in Court, by reaſon that (as ſeldome are the Turkes without great<note place="margin">Scanderbeg made General of an army in Aſia.</note> affaires) there came newes of new troubles, and tumults in <hi>Aſia,</hi> whereunto <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg</hi> was appointed; being choſen by an vniuerſall decree, and the good liking of all men, to haue the commaund as Generall ouer the whole armie, with all the honors appertaining to that place in regard of his former deſertes, and for that he had borne himſelfe ſo well in the forepaſſed warres.

of <hi>Scythia</hi> a certaine aduenturer, more faire and arrogant in outwarde ſhew and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, then valiant and braue in fight and combat: This gallant defied and challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged<note place="margin">A challenge of combat made by a Sythian to the Turkes.</note> all the Court of the Turke, demaunding if there were any one who durſt encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him in armes, and to proue himſelfe in fight againſt him. And this was the order of the combat which he offred: That both the champions naked in their ſhirts being ſhut vp in a ſtreight and narrow place, with their ſwordes only ſhould make triall to whom the hazard of the victorie would befall. This raſh and inconſiderate plot had this Tartarian laide, and made choiſe of, either becauſe he was prodigall of his bloud and life, or, it may be, of a vaine hope and conceite, that none durſt accept the chance and hazard of a daunger ſo ambiguous, and of an act ſo vnaduiſed: by meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of his happe might be to beare away the praiſe, and to obtaine ſome great rewarde without endaungering himſelfe in combat. <hi>Amurath</hi> alſo had proclaimed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the conquerour a certaine prize of great and rich value, that he might by all meanes poſſible, animate ſome of his ſeruants in hope of ſo great a rewarde to accept the challenge: as if indeede the onely fruite and glory of the bare victory alone would not haue allured and drawen men on to vndertake the combat.

This day therefore I alſo will make a preſent of my bloud vnto <hi>Amurath,</hi> and the reſt of my companions.</q> The <hi>Scythian</hi> being no whit abaſhed nor terrified, thought with moſt braue &amp; fierce words to haue affraied and appaled him, calling him boy and childe (for he was not as then but in the prime of his youthfull yeares, and the ſoft downe had not yet budded on his chinne, nor made his faire and ſmoth face to become rough.) Then being conducted towardes the Sultan, with loud and high clamors of the people: and the field being appointed for the combat according as the Barbarian had demaunded: both of them were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently ſhifted out of their garments, hauing not ſo much as their ſhirtes to couer them: and thus leaping all naked into the place, by this new and vnwonted kinde of ſpectacle, they made all the ſtanders by to regard them with admiration. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that <hi>Caſtriot</hi> both by his voice and by his countenance did bewray in himſelfe a wonderfull reſolution and aſſurance, notwithſtanding an incredible kind of care in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled with griefe did aſſaile the hearts of the regardants, and at one inſtant both the age, and the comlineſſe of his perſon, ioyned with a gratious and pleaſing cariage of all the parts of his bodie, had drawen them both to fauour, and to pittie him. Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, high, and eminent was his ſtature, his armes ſo ſeemely as the like had ſcarce bene ſeene: his necke ſtrong and ſomewhat bending, ſuch as is much commended in<note place="margin">The deſcription of Scanderbeg his perſon.</note> great wraſtlers: his ſhoulders large and maruellouſly well ſpred: his viſage of colour

Theſe corporall perfections did him great ſeruice to his other vertues, and the good qualities of his mind, which ſeemed to be augmented &amp; increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by them. The two champions thus reſolute and well aſſured, being furniſhed with ſhort daggers, (for longer weapons would not the ſtreightneſſe of the place permit) made their entry into the field, &amp; were there left with great ſilence on all parts. It is not to be imagined that here needed any great counſel and aduiſe, or any rare and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie hardines and reſolution, but onely a certaine promptitude, and readines, and a quicke and deliuer agility of the hand. Both of them now ſtanding vpon their gard, and ech readie to offend the other, the <hi>Scythian</hi> gaue the firſt charge, and onſet vpon his enemie: againſt whom dreſſing and bearing the point of his dagger, he ſtroke at his belly with intent to haue ſtabbed him: <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> bending his bodie in all partes, and bowing it arch-wiſe almoſt in forme of a bow, with his left hand ſeized on the right arme of the barbarian, and ſtayed the blow: and in the ſame inſtant aduancing his poignard, at one blow he cut his throat, and that with ſuch dexteritie, as he deuided all the arteries of it aſunder. So that with his tongue yet ſtaggering and ſtuttering<note place="margin">The victorie of Scanderbeg.</note> in his head, he tumbled to the ground, litle wanting but that he filled al the place with the maſſie hugenes of his bodie. But being ſoone and ſpeedily remoued by thoſe that ſtood neere at hand to behold the fight, and diuerſe of the Courtiers alſo flocking together full of ioy and gladnes about the Victor, they led him ſafe and ſound vnto the preſence of <hi>Amurath,</hi> vnto whome (being exceedingly ioyous of his good happe) with his hands yet all bloody, his champion preſented the head of the dead <hi>Scythian.</hi> Then were deliuered vnto him the rewardes ordained for the partie that ſhould obtaine the victorie, which he accepted (as it were) vnwillingly: proteſting that he did not hazard himſelfe in that enterpriſe, neither for gold nor ſiluer, but onely to maintaine the honor of the Court, and to repreſſe the arrogancie of the barbarian. So great was the modeſtie of this braue Epirot, that thereby he allured vnto him more and more the good will of ech perſon: the naturall bountie and dexteritie of his gentle heart aboliſhing the enuie and hatred, which the excellency of exceeding vertue doth vſually engender in men of his ſort and calling. I hold it not amiſſe here in this place alſo to recount one other exploite which he atchieued with no leſſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and commendation, and with like courage by force of armes. At ſuch time as he followed <hi>Amurath</hi> into <hi>Bithynia</hi> in a voiage which he made thither rather for his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and recreation then vpon any occaſion of warre: There were at that time in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Burſa</hi> (which is at this preſent the capitall city of the empire of <hi>Aſia</hi>) two <hi>Perſians</hi> named <hi>Iaia,</hi> &amp; <hi>Zampſa</hi> being of a very faire &amp; goodly ſtature, &amp; moſt ſumptuouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled,<note place="margin">The ſecond combat of Sca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Ech of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pleaded in the behalfe of the other, and by magnifying and extolling their owne acts, the one ſought to further the others ſute with mutuall teſtimonies and ſoothing vp of ech other, that it ſeemed to proceed more of a kind of impudent and ſhameleſſe audacitie, then of any valure or reſolution in them. At laſt <hi>Zampſa</hi> the younger of the two ſpake vnto <hi>Amurath</hi> in this manner. <q>To the intent (moſt mightie and puiſſant king) it may not be thought, that we are come, furniſhed onely with glorious ſpeeches and great wordes to demaund thy pay, and that (the certaintie thereof being vnknowne vnto thee) we be not condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of vaine arrogancie, nor of fooliſh hardineſſe and forward temeritie: behold here we are readie to make proofe before thee of our courages, if not haughtie, yet at leaſt deſirous of honor and glorie. Though there be here many braue men, and full of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:13368:13"/>
we chalenge them all to take armes, that it may be tryed whether we be worthy or vnworthy to liue vnder the commaund of thy greatneſſe.</q> Then ſhewing that they had no other armes but their horſe, ſword, launce, and ſhield, and that their bodies were not otherwiſe armed: they ſayed that they would combat only thus appointed. <hi>Amurath</hi> (as he was both courteous and gracious) after he had ſpoken vnto them with a kind of benignitie, he promiſed them that they ſhould want nothing which on his part might be conueniently yeelded vnto them. And then turning his head, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king here and there round about him, he ſtayed to ſee if any one would receiue the chalenge. But perceiuing that euery man ſtood ſtill and mute, and that all his ſeruants did by their ſilence bewray a ſecret confeſſion and acknowledgement of their faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe &amp; backwardnes, ſuppoſing it would be ſmally for his honor &amp; reputation, if the preſumption of thoſe <hi>Perſians</hi> ſhould ſo reſt vnpuniſhed: caſting his countenance vpon <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> as being well acquainted with his hardines and fierce courage, by meanes whereof he made no doubt, but he would vpon any termes vndertake it though the perill were very doubtfull and hazardous: he thus ſpake vnto him. <q>What is thy cauſe of ſtay (my ſonne) in whom all vertue and valure doe abound ſo exceedingly? This doth belong to thee, and the glorie of this victorie doth tarrie for thee. Go to then, once againe at this time let the gallantiſe and brauery of thy youth, and thy inuincible arme, be made yet more famous and memorable, by ſome notable act in this ſpectacle.</q> Litle entreatie needed to encourage him to this attempt: for hauing kiſſed the prince his feete (according to the Turkiſh cuſtome) he called for horſe and armour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be giuen him, and iſſuing forth (with great applauſe of the people) into the middeſt of a large plaine appointed for the combat, with a braue audacity he called his enemies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: demaunding of them what order they ment to obſerue in the fight. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion was, that <hi>Iaia</hi> ſhould firſt aſſay his fortune, and if he were victorious that then the fight ſhould be determined, but if he were vanquiſhed then his companion ſhould ſucceede him, and at all aduentures to abide the hazard of the like condition. <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg</hi> would not refuſe their order, albeit the kings ſeruantes (who accompanied him into the liſtes) did alleage the inequalitie of the order, affirming that it was againſt reaſon that the party which had the victorie againſt the one (if he hapned to be either weary or wounded) ſhould endure a ſecond enemy freſh and ſound: notwithſtanding (after that the preſſe of people was auoided out of the place) the trumpet gaue the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of the battell, and the champions ſet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſpurres to their horſes, fetching a full courſe ech againſt the other. Then the <hi>Perſian</hi> hauing faſtned his lance in the ſhield of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie, bare himſelfe cloſe coutched with all his force full vppon him, thinking to haue throwen him from his horſe, and therewithall he brake his ſtaffe vpon him. On the other ſide, the <hi>Albanois</hi> (who ranne onely at the head) did miſſe altogether in his courſe, by meanes whereof, both the one and the other hauing runne in vaine, they held on their cariere, ech paſſing beſide other that they might afterwards betake them to their courtelaxes. But <hi>Zampſa</hi> hauing loſt all patience (without tarying for the iſſue and euent of his companions fortune) aduaunced himſelfe, and coutched his lance againſt <hi>Scanderbeg:</hi> who on the other ſide quickly perceiuing the danger, and that it was not now time with booteleſſe termes of expoſtulation to accuſe his enemie of diſloyaltie, prepared himſelfe to aſſaile him manfully, and preſsing hard vppon him with his launce, he pierced him cleane through the throate. Scarcely was he laide on the ground, but that <hi>Iaia</hi> running haſtily thither, and with an horrible voice addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelfe againſt <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> with his ſword in his hande, it litle wanted that he had not ſlaine him, but he ſpeedily gaue his horſe the turne, and returning vpon him with his ſword likewiſe drawen, he ſuſtained the force of his enemie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming againſt

            <p>It may be that I haue dwelt ouerlong, and beyond all meaſure vpon the deedes of this worthy perſon: but in my opinion the praiſe and commendation of men of war and the commemoration of their actes in particular; is a principall point which doth wholly and eſpecially belong vnto them. <q>For that which is done in the warres, others haue their part and intereſt therein: but theſe exploites did <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> atchiue with his owne proper hand: and therefore my deſire is (if it muſt needes be) that our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſhould be noted rather to exceed in being ſuperfluous,</q> then to ſeeme ingrate in not giuing him his deſerts, &amp; the rather, for that I mind to be but briefe in other ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces effected of like nature and condition, of which alſo I am preſently to intreat. That which he did in the ſight of <hi>Amurath</hi> at the taking of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> and <hi>Pruſia,</hi> and at <hi>Ottrea</hi> a good towne in <hi>Aſia</hi> is nothing inferiour vnto his former deedes, whether we regard the daunger, or the greatnes of the fact: for he was the firſt man that mounted on the wall, and diſplaied his enſigne on the rampier: and entring the towne in maner all alone, he was the chiefe cauſe of the winning of the ſame. Likewiſe being ſent into <hi>Europe</hi> againſt the Chriſtians: ſometime againſt the Greeks, and at other times againſt the Hungarians, he did more often purchaſe the renowme and eſtimation of a ſage &amp; prudent Captaine, then of one too venturous and ouer hardie. If he ſaw any neceſſitie that hee muſt needes ioyne in battell, and that he could not either refuſe it without ſuſpition, or giue it without griefe: he would before all things, deſire of God, that it might be far from him to purchaſe honor by ſhedding of the blood of Chriſtians, &amp; to keepe him from vſing crueltie towards them: for in outward appearance only, and in his externall habit, he was a Mahometiſt, but inwardly, and in his hart, he did moſt conſtantly obſerue the faith and profeſſion of a Chriſtian. Neuertheleſſe as often not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding as he was enforced to marche againſt them, he did euer ſeeke by all meanes poſſible, as litle as might be, to endomage them: prouided alwaies that he did not thereby wrong his owne forces of which he had the command and gouernment. By meanes wherof, he did beare himſelfe ſo well, &amp; did his deuoire in ſo good faſhion, and did ſo fully diſcharge the dutie of a good and politique Captaine in all ſeruices of charge both within the campe and in fight, that euen the Chriſtians themſelues did not maligne him any whit the more for it. And this his moderate, ſtayd, and aduiſed behauior ſeemed to proceed rather of true diſcipline and prudence militarie, then of any fraude, ignorance, or want of courage: and continually did he gouerne himſelfe with ſuch arte and dexteritie, that he would neuer ſuffer himſelfe (if he could chuſe)
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:13368:14"/>
to be beaten: and yet by all meanes poſſible, would he giue oportunity to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to ſaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues: or (if he could not do otherwiſe) he would take them priſoners: holding it farre more tollerable for them to endure ſeruitude and bondage, then to be put to the ſword, and vtterly to be deſtroyed. When he would exhort or endourage his ſouldiers at any time, he did it with ſuch a grace, &amp; ſo effectually (were it in campe, or in the middeſt, and heate of fight) that he would worke in them both ſhame and feare almoſt at one inſtant: and afterwardes in the furie of fight he would order all matters ſo ſubtilly by the liuelineſſe of his ſpirit, and the ſtate of his armie ſhould be diſpoſed ſo cunningly, that the preſeruation thereof (ſeeming to be with a certaine difficultie, and by his extraordinarie vertue) did afterwardes purchaſe him more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and eſtimation with <hi>Ottoman,</hi> then others could obtaine by many a notable and famous victorie. From thencefoorth there was none that went beyonde him in credite and authoritie about the King: and no man was more agreeable, and better accepted amongſt the ſouldiers, by reaſon that he was courteous, familiar, and friendly, not challenging to himſelfe in particular, the honour which was gotten in common, but attributing it to the whole companie. Whatſoeuer money came to his handes he would diſtribute bountifully, and diſpend liberally; iudging the ſame (and not without cauſe) to be of great efficacie and force to drawe vnto him the mindes and goodwill of men: and the ſureſt bond to tie the heartes of the popular ſort vnto him. Euerie man of his owne free will and motion, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out call, would gladly haue beene ranged vnder his enſigne: and for the loue of him would expoſe him ſelfe freely to the hazarde of all perilles. But fortune did not long forbeare to powre foorth her venome: for <hi>Iohn</hi> the father of <hi>Caſtriot</hi> in<note place="margin">Iohn Caſtriot dieth.</note> this meane time happened to dye in <hi>Epire,</hi> whereof <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> being aduertized, albeit by theſe lamentable tidinges (according to his naturall dutie) he conceiued exceeding ſorrow in his minde: yet did he neuer diſcouer by any open and apparant ſignes of ſadneſſe or mourning, the ſecret dolour and griefe which lay hidden with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his heart.

But this is my full reſolution, to liue continually vnder the wing of thy Maieſtie: and aſſure thy ſelfe that hardly, or not at all, will I be of anie other minde.

            <p>The king tooke ſingular pleaſure at his ſpeeches, and ſo great credite did he giue<note place="margin">Scanderbeg his wiſedome and prudence.</note> vnto his wordes, that he heaped promiſe vpon promiſes, endeuouring to fill him with hopes, and the expectance of great matters. From that time forward the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banois</hi> beganne ſecretly to feele the maladie and griefe which did dayly ſpreade it ſelfe more and more: and notwithſtanding that with ſingular diſcretion he did diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble all things, yet did not that make him negligent, but that he did looke nearely vnto him ſelfe, and tooke great care for the ſafetie of his perſon; and the more he was in doubt of the tyrant, the more did he ſtudie to purchaſe the fauour of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and the affection of the ſouldiers. Neuertheleſſe being vnceſſantly occupied in ſome one or other tumult in the warres, he did euerie day adde newe matter to make him ſelfe renowmed, and no leſſe did he growe to be enuied. For he could
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:13368:15"/>
not ſo eaſily preuent the faithleſneſſe of men, either by the modeſt ſhew of his mind, or by his liberality and ordinary curteſie: but that with the time euen vertue it ſelfe did engender the contrary to his deſire. In ſo much that there were ſome in the Court, who (not able to endure the apparaunce of ſo great vertue in a ſtraunger, euery day<note place="margin">Scanderbeg en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uied, ſlaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the Turkes Court.</note> more and more increaſing) as ſoone as they perceiued that <hi>Amurath</hi> did any thing encline or hearken vnto them: they would daily ſlaunder him behind his backe, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their Lord to vnderſtand for certainty, that the ſumptuous expences which he beſtowed vppon the common ſort ſo bountifully, and the fauour of the people which he ſought for ſo ambitiouſly, were a ready meane to raiſe him in power, puiſſance, and authority: Alledging moreouer, that he being ſuſpected by thoſe in court, it was a good and ſufficient proofe of that which he did inwardly intend and aſpire vnto. All this it was eaſie to perſwade the Prince, and the rather for that the accuſation of his mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence and his large expences, did openly ſhew it ſelfe to be true according to their ſurmiſe. Alſo the old age of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> being of it ſelfe fearefull, iealous, and ſuſpitious, did curiouſly interpret all other matters to the worſt; in ſuch ſort that a certain doubt did by litle and litle engender in his ſpirite, cauſing him to be miſtruſtfull not only for the Realme of <hi>Albany,</hi> but alſo for the ſoueraignty euen of his own Empire. And his conſcience being confounded and conuinced by the gilt of his owne miſdeedes and wickednes, and the iealouſie which he had of his eſtate ill gotten, made him repute all things ful oftrechery and infidelity: and to ſuſpect his moſt inward and familiar frends as moſt dangerous and ſecrete enemies. This his ſuſpition being augmented, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan ſecretely to hate <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> and to beare a more watchfull and intentiue eye v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him: to ſee if he could by any couert and cloſe meanes cut him off, and worke his confuſion; not that his wicked and pernicious will wanted power and liberty to doe any miſchief, but becauſe he had no reaſonable cauſe, nor ſufficient colour to procure his death &amp; deſtruction. To oppreſſe him wrongfully and by violence he was afeard, becauſe he ſaw him ſo well beloued of all men generally; and for feare leaſt he ſhould alienate the hearts of others, and by an example of ſuch cruelty, ſhut vp and take away in time to come from his Kingdome, the hope of all vertues and good deſerts by any ſtraungers: by which meanes principally the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire had bene amplified, and raiſed vnto his greatneſſe.</p>
            <p>But whileſt theſe things were thus a doing, other affairs of greater waight and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance<note place="margin">This Seruia, Boſnia, and Ruſſia is called by the Turkes Segoria.</note> happening abroad, did ſucke and ſwallow vp theſe domeſticall ſuſpitions &amp; diſtruſts: for open warre was proclaimed againſt <hi>George</hi> Lord of <hi>Miſia,</hi> commonly called the <hi>Deſpot</hi> of <hi>Seruia.</hi> The king of Turkes deſired nothing more then to commit this charge vnto <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> and that for two ſpeciall conſiderations: The one, becauſe he could not finde any man, whoſe ſeruice in his affaires was ſo fortunate as was his: The other, for that knowing him to be hot &amp; forward in the war, and prompt &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to hazard him ſelfe to all dangers, he did well hope that he ſhould ſee him miſcarie in ſome one encounter or other againſt the enemy; as in armes it doth oftentimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide<note place="margin">Scanderbeg ſent with an army againſt the Deſpot of Seruia.</note> to diuers. For this cauſe hauing leauied his forces, <hi>Caſtriot</hi> was ſent againſt the <hi>Miſians.</hi> This was at that time, that he dealt worſer with the Chriſtians, then he was accuſtomed, for feare leaſt in temporiſing, &amp; attending ſome fit oportunity of retrait, if he ſhould not take the occaſion to ouercome when it was offered, he might miniſter matter of ſuſpition to <hi>Amurath,</hi> who was already enclined to take any impreſsion of miſtruſt in his iealous and ſuſpicious head. Oftentimes therfore he defeated the <hi>Deſpot,</hi> and put him to the worſe, returning in all conflictes with victory to <hi>Andrinople.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, at ſuch time as the ſaid <hi>Deſpot</hi> had newly repaired his forces, and did begin to make head againe, and to reenforce his army; <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> being diſpatched againſt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:13368:15"/>
him with more luſty forces, did vanquiſh him in battell, and put his army to flight. And hauing razed many of his holdes and fortreſſes: he ledde backe his ſouldiers loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with the ſpoiles and rich booty of their enemies.</p>
            <p>Theſe tumults abroad being appeaſed, the old wretch by the like purſuit of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer<note place="margin">Amurath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpireth and practiſeth the deſtruction of Scanderbeg.</note> deteſtable deſſeignes, did againe addreſſe himſelfe and conſpire againſt him, who had bin the author of ſo notable a victory, and of the reſt, and tranquillity of his eſtate. To this end he cauſed the ſame time a ſolemn Iuſts and tournement to be proclaimed both on horſebacke and on foote, promiſing gifts and rewards of great value to them that ſhould beare away the prize: to the intent that by this deuiſe and policy he might expoſe and put <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> to all perils and extreme dangers. But as his counſails were abhominable, ſo did they appeare to be vain and of no effect: For albeit great numbers both of ſubiects and of ſtrangers, all hardy, actiue, and able men did daily preſent them ſelues to this triumph: yet did <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> continually ſhew himſelfe amongſt them, &amp; with an admirable hardines &amp; brauery, and no leſſe good hap held againſt all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mers, and as one fatally predeſtinated to be victorious, he alone did cary away the honor &amp; the prize, with the extreme wonder and ſingular fauor of all men. The vnmatcheable vertue in this gentle warriour, which might haue ſufficed to aſſwage and mollifie the arrogancy &amp; fiercenes euen of his enemies, could no whit bend the corage of <hi>Ottoman</hi> alone to any curteſie or clemency, but his diſtruſt ech day growing more forcible, his heart alſo began to be enraged &amp; enflamed with anger &amp; hatred, making him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think with himſelf more ardently, how he might by ſome other ſecret kinde of death diſpatch him. But why am I thus caried away in the purſuit of theſe vain reuenges, &amp; fooliſh counſailes of <hi>Amurath</hi> on the one part, &amp; the prouidence of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> on the other part? why rather do I not in a word attribute the ſafety and preſeruation of this man vnto God only? Aſſuredly he it was that confounded the ſpirits &amp; ſenſes of <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:</hi> he it was that raiſed vp thoſe diſturbances of the wars, and new commotions in <hi>Miſia:</hi> finally, he it was that ſtirred vp the arms of the Hungarians, to the intent that this mans life (being vowed and deſtinated to maintaine the dignity of the Chriſtian religion) ſhould not be abridged &amp; cut off: and that the ancient liberty of <hi>Epire</hi> might once again be reuiued: for had not a kind of diuine power interpoſed it ſelf in this caſe: there is no doubt but that <hi>Amurath</hi> had attained to the height of his intent and deſire. Did he want any means to bring him to his end? might he not haue had a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes with which (without the leaſt fear of ſedition) he might haue circumuented him? where were poiſons? where were ſecret traines &amp; ambuſhments? where were falſ and ſlanderous accuſations, which are the ordinary weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of tyrants to execute their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and miſchieuous attempts? <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> hauing with great facility diſcouered theſe trains &amp; ſecret practiſes, &amp; perceiuing that (if he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued long about the prince) he ſhould hardly be able to auoide his ſnares, he found it high time to bethink himſelf how he might aduance his affaires, for the recouery of his fathers eſtate by ſome good &amp; vertuous exploit, &amp; by the ſubtelty of his own ſpirit (a thing which he had alwaies conceiued in his thoughts by the ſweete remembrance of his liberty) he deuiſed ſome honeſt colour to quit him ſelfe of the ſeruice of <hi>Amurath,</hi> &amp; vnder pretence thereof, to return one day into his own natiue country, ſo greatly by him deſired: where all men with one mind did attend and wiſh him with a veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; generall affection: yet did he neuer impart this his determination to any man liuing: neither did any perſon euer diſcerne his hidden conceite, either by word or by any other ſigne, notwithſtanding<note place="margin">Scanderbeg ſollicited by the Albanians to the recouery of his eſtate.</note> that there were many, &amp; eſpecially of the <hi>Albanois,</hi> in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he might haue repoſed ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall confidence, by reaſon of their ordinary frequenting, &amp; long familiarity together: &amp; eſpecially ſome of them, who after the deceaſe of <hi>Iohn</hi> his father (inuited thereunto
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:13368:16"/>
aſwell through the bruite of his great renowne, as for the deſire they had to recouer their libertie) were come vnto him on the behalfe of the principall and chiefeſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in <hi>Albanie,</hi> to offer him the meanes, occaſion, and oportunitie, together with the aide of the ſubiects, to pull his fathers crowne and ſcepter out of the hands of <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath.</hi> Notwithſtanding, knowing how great the inconſtancie and lightneſſe of men is, and conſidering the greatneſſe of the perill, he diſſembled it verie wiſely, and the rather for that (holding it a verie eaſie matter to get the poſſeſſion of all other things) yet he had his minde mightily perplexed and diſtracted, how he might recouer <hi>Croie,</hi> which was his principall care. The Turke had furniſhed it with ſo ſtrong a garriſon, that it was impoſſible to gaine it by armes or by force, but onely by art and induſtrie. It was alſo the chiefe and capitoll citie of the realme of <hi>Albanie,</hi> ſituated vpon the creſt of a moſt high and ragged mountaine, and on all ſides almoſt inacceſſible, being ſo fortified by art, and ſo defended by the naturall ſite thereof, that (except it were by famine onely) for an enemie to vſe any other force or violence againſt it, it might<note place="margin">Scanderbeg his wiſedome and ſingular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</note> be held meere folly, and a verie mockerie. By meanes whereof, if the mind of <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg</hi> were at any time ſounded in it, he would commend their affection, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of their libertie not yet wholly extinguiſhed in the hearts of their nation: But he alledged the wonderfull power and puiſſance of the Turke: telling them, that his gouernement was not grieuous nor inſupportable, and that it was but a follie and meere madneſſe, raſhly to begin any tumult or commotion, where was wanting ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient forces to bring them to a good concluſion. And that they ought not to account of that libertie, the poſſeſſion whereof would be of ſhort continuance, and for which they ſhould afterwards be brought, not into the like and ſo eaſie a ſeruitude, but into a bondage, and reſtraint of libertie farre more grieuous and intollerable: bringing themſelues in the end to be murthered and maſſacred as ſacrifices to appeaſe the wrath of the Prince, who would be mightily incenſed againſt them, by reaſon of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. And yet did he alwayes comfort and cheere them vp, promiſing them, that according to the credite and authoritie which he had with <hi>Amurath,</hi> he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, that their yoke might be gracious, and his gouernement ſo moderate as might ſtand with the condition and ſtate of their affaires. Thus did he diſcreetly prouide on all partes both for them and for him ſelfe: and did continually temporiſe, finely plotting &amp; deuiſing the way and oportunitie how to eſcape and get away; no more nor leſſe then as a poore priſoner, who attending with great patience and deuotion ſome ſedition within the place of his reſtraint, and a generall aſtoniſhment of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, by meanes whereof, whileſt euerie man is buſied in extinguiſhing the fire of the diſſention, he may in the meane time ſtrike off his fetters and breake priſon: and (aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring thereby his libertie) it may be the meanes to auoyd the hard ſentence of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and ſeuere iudge.</p>
            <p>True it is, that fortune did not long hold his deſire in ſuſpence, for whileſt theſe things were thus in doing, the <hi>Deſpot</hi> of <hi>Miſia</hi> (of whom we haue lately ſpoken)<note place="margin">Deſpot of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia reeſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed againe by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Amurath.</note> was reeſtabliſhed againe in his eſtate, as well by the reuolt of his owne ſubiects from the Sultan, as by the forces of his neighbours, and the ayde of his friends ſometime chaſing and expelling, &amp; ſometimes cutting in peeces ſome of the Turkiſh garriſons. By occaſion whereof the Sultan being grieuouſly incenſed againſt him, &amp; perceiuing that to bring him to reaſon he muſt not from thenceforth any more commit the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his affaires to other chiefes &amp; commanders: he determined to go thither him ſelfe in perſon, and hauing leuied a moſt puiſſant armie, hee marched againſt the <hi>Miſian,</hi> with purpoſe vtterly to ſuppreſſe and deſtroy him; the which did verie ſoone and eaſily fall out, euen according as hee wiſhed: for that the <hi>Deſpot</hi> being
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:13368:16"/>
farre inferiour vnto him in power and puiſſaunce, did (as it were) at the firſt ſtroke, looſe all his holdes, and places of ſtrength, and flying into <hi>Hungarie,</hi> left all vnto him, without any one droppe of bloud ſhedde in defence thereof. Some ſay that <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi> in this voyage, did aide him ſelfe with the counſell and ſeruice of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> rather then of any other in his Court: as of one, who by his happy conduct in many other warres forepaſſed in thoſe quarters, had gotten more knowledge and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the places, and of that countrey, then any other whatſoeuer. But as yet for all that, could he finde no fitte occaſion to effect his owne deſſines and purpoſes, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that the time was not now farre off to accompliſhe it. For <hi>Amurath</hi> had ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought backe his troupes to <hi>Andrinople,</hi> and licenſing them to depart, had ſcant broken vp his Campe; but a publique bruite and report began to grow of new trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and emotions of the Hungarians, and of other daungers approching, farre more furious then the former.

rather to flie then to fight: or becauſe he was in doubt that he was deceiued and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied, in regard whereof he charged the enemy more faintly and with leſſe ſtomack, This was the occaſion that the Hungarians being encouraged (as it appeared) by the feare of the other, without any great force or effuſion of bloud, brake and ſcattered the battell of their enemies, who abandoning their armes, and baggage, their Captaines<note place="margin">Turkes ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen by Huniades.</note> and Enſigns, without any care of their companions: and hauing no other recourſe but to their heeles, endeuoured to ſaue them ſelues by running. <hi>Huniades</hi> purſuing the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of his victory, neuer left killing ſo long as there reſted any for execution.

The letters being written, both the Secretary, and all the reſt which were taken together with him, were preſently put to death, to the intent that the matter might the longer remaine concealed from the great Seigniour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not they onely, but as many as fell into the hands of <hi>Caſtriot</hi> had no better fortune. So that this army of the Turkes was almoſt all brought to nothing: for that thoſe alſo which eſcaped the fury of the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, comming (by meanes of their diſperſed and ſcattering flight) into the handes of the Paiſants by one and the ſame death made an end of their daies. A great number of the ſouldiers Albanois who were preſent at this encounter, after they had intelligence of the act of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> as they went here and there wandering and diſperſed, aſwell to auoide the hand of the Conqueror, but principally pricked with the deſire of their natiue countrey, did gather them ſelues neare vnto him: and in an inſtant they were found to be a troupe of three hundred good and able men. <hi>Haniades</hi> and his people charged with ineſtimable ſpoile and booty, did retire themſelues to their compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I may not here let paſſe in ſilence that which ſome haue ſeemed to affirme: That <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> had before hand had ſome intelligence with the Hungarians, and by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret meſſengers had acquainted and inſtructed <hi>Huniades</hi> of all matters in particular, &amp; that he was the cauſe that made him haſten with his forces. Howſoeuer it was as I dare not auerre it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo I doe not greatly ſtand vpon it.

This towne is ſeated in the confines of the <hi>Tribullians,</hi> ſeauenty miles from <hi>Croie,</hi> and is very famous amongſt the <hi>Epirots,</hi> for that it bringeth forth men very actiue and valiant: and it was ſingularly eſteemed and fauoured of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> by reaſon of their fidelity, and many commendable ſeruices which they had done for the defence and protection of the ſtate vnder <hi>Iohn</hi> his father, at ſuch time as he was moleſted by <hi>Ottoman.</hi> Other towne or fortreſſe there is not in thoſe Marches towardes <hi>Macedony,</hi> but onely <hi>Sfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigrade:</hi> but the people of the countrey diſperſed throughout mountaines, and vallies without any encloſures of walles, doe preſerue them ſelues by the onely naturall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the places againſt the violence and iniuries of their enemies. <hi>Caſtriot</hi> then there firſt of all made ſome ſtay, not holding it conuenient to paſſe further, till he had ordained and ſet in order certaine affaires of ſome conſequence and importance as you ſhall heare. Hauing ſent (very ſecretely) for ſome of the principalleſt in the towne to come vnto him (for he had a ſpeciall care to conceale, and keepe all things ſecret, and therefore had ſo diſpoſed his iourney, as he might arriue thither in the night) he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered vnto them the ſecrets of his thoughts, and he obtained al things to his content, not ſo much as one perſon being found, (as the report goeth) that would in any thing gaineſay his demaund, either for feate of the grand Seignour, or for miſtruſt of an act ſo dangerous; or of his owne diſpoſition, as ſome would haue done. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, their owne deſire ſo long time nouriſhed, the incomparable reputation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, conceiued by ſo many yeares (which was a great furtherance vnto it) and withall the loue and ſingular deſire which they had of liberty, had wonderfully wrought him into the good grace and fauour of euery man. All therefore in generall, which were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him (as it were) in emulation each of other, ſometime with great ioy and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph: ſometime ſheading of teares through exceſsiue gladneſſe, with long embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſome kiſſed his handes, others his face, one the head, another his feete, yea and al parts of his body, ſeeming to be rauiſhed with the ioy of his good fortune: and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſingular contentment which they had in the reſource, and reſtitution of the <hi>Albanois</hi> name and maieſty. And preſenting vnto him all the means of their vtmoſt power, and ability, they offered the ſame vnto him: both their bodies, their hearts, their children, and whatſoeuer was of any better accompt, and value then other euen vnto their liues. The firſt thing that they tooke order for, was to ſet good and ſpeedy watch and ward, for feare that (during theſe affairs) ſome aduertiſement ſhould come from the Turke to the gouernour of <hi>Croy,</hi> which might diſcouer the practiſe. It was aduiſed alſo touching the leuy that ſhould be made; what forces ſhould take armes at the firſt ſignal and token that ſhould be giuen them. Of the three hundred horſe which he had brought with him, reſeruing but a very ſmal number (with which he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ride to <hi>Croy</hi> to preſent the Packet to the Gouernour, and to receiue the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) the reſidue he ſent before, and well neare as many of the <hi>Dibrians,</hi> who knew all the paſſages of the countrey, willing them very cloſely to ambuſh them ſelues in the woods, and thickets next to <hi>Croy,</hi> til ſuch time as he had gotten poſſeſsion of the town, and that then he would couertly let them in to cut the throates of the Garriſon. All things being well diſpoſed and in order, the ſelfe ſame night that he came thither (it was in the end of Autumne, when the nights began to grow long) he whom the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentnes of his deſire did make impatient of delay, and who held that the leaſt ſtay, was
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:13368:18"/>
of great importance to endanger his enterpriſe, earely in the morning before the breake of day, he departed from <hi>Dibria,</hi> accompanied with his troupe of horſe, and his baggage, and certaine of the Dibrians who attended him, and he drew directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Croy,</hi> with as great ſpeede as might be. And as he approched towardes the towne, willing by this deuiſe to ſet the better colour vpon his deliberation, and to make it ſeeme more probable, he commanded on the way that <hi>Ameſe,</hi> with two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as his ſeruants, ſhould goe before to cary the newes vnto the Gouernour, and to aduertiſe him, that he with his traine was not farre off. The young man being of an excellent quicke ſpirite, and good courage, and ſo well diſſembling him ſelfe both in habite and in ſpeach, as if he had bene a Turke naturall, was receiued into the towne, and went ſpeedily to finde the Gouernour: vnto whom, (hauing after their maner) done his reuerence, with a good grace he began to make mention of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was his Secretary, and with great modesty told him withall, that his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and his traine onely, would be there very ſpeedily. As God would, that which <hi>Ameſe</hi> deliuered, was from point to point beleeued, and from thence forward the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian</hi> began to prepare and make him ſelfe ready to depart: and before that he had either read the letters, or had any notice of the will and pleaſure of his Prince, he truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp his baggage, and prouided to diſlodge: in ſuch ſort, that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> being come, and the Packet opened, and the letters read, credit was giuen vnto the ſame, and they obeyed thereunto, according to their tenour and contents, and the <hi>Albanois</hi> was<note place="margin">The gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Croy, reſigned vnto Scanderbeg, by the Gouernor.</note> receiued with great ioy. Then were called before him (as is the vſe) all the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary garriſon, and the auncient inhabitants of the towne of all ages and eſtate. His great renow me being diſperſed ouer all partes, made him much eſteemed and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commed of euery man. The Turkes loued his naturall diſpoſition becauſe he was popular and familiar, by occaſion whereof, all of them tooke it in good part to be vnder his command. The <hi>Croians,</hi> who ſaw before their eyes the race of their good Prince, did forth with take heart and courage, and (neither more nor leſſe, then as if they had preſently bene deliuered from ſome long captiuity and miſery) they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan ſodainely to conceiue in their inward thoughtes and wiſhes, the ſecret coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailes and enterpriſe of <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi> And in eſpeciall, ſome of thoſe who were of eldeſt yeares amongeſt them, and did as yet retaine their auncient deſire, carying in their mindes the apparaunt ſignes of his vertue ſhining in him from his infancy, they would diſcourſe of his education, the beginning of his birth and natiuity, and the curious preſages of his parents; yet was there not any one of them all the while, that durſt open his conceite vnto the new Captaine, nor yet betake him to armes, till they ſaw that he him ſelfe did aduaunce forward, and ſet in foote as chiefe and leader to regaine their liberty. (It was concluded betweene <hi>Caſtriot</hi> and a few o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that ſome ſhould ſtirre vp the youth of the towne, and when time ſerued prouoke them to take armes: and it was forbidden them to make any ſigne or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of alteration, till that the ſuccours of the men at armes, (which lay neare the towne in ambuſhment) were let in within the gates: the which being enioyned them to be done ſecretely, and in the dead time of the night, was put in execution, and they were brought into the towne. The portes being ſhutte, the ſtreetes, the croſſe wayes, and all the ſtrongeſt paſſages being filled with armed ſouldiers, the Turkes not knowing any thing of their counſailes, or at leaſt for feare diſſembling it: and the errour of the night augmenting the feare of the daunger, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> gaue the ſignall to beginne the maſſacre.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:13368:18"/>
put to the ſword, others being diſpoſed in their places. With no leſſe furie the priuate houſes being forced open, the bands of <hi>Croie</hi> were the firſt that marched, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> himſelfe doing the office both of a commander and a ſouldier. At the ſhutting vp of the gates, many being ſurprized ſuddenly, had their throtes cut in their beds. But the alarme being come from one and other to all the reſt, a great number being wakened, ran preſently to armes according as the tumult, and the darkneſſe of the night did giue them leaſure: and rendring them ſelues vpon the place, they endeuored to caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in order of battell, with intent either to die honorably, or by making head a while againſt the enemie, and gaining one of the ports, to ſaue them ſelues by flight. This notwithſtanding, all the paſſages being ſhut vp, and both the one and the other of their deſſeignes being aſſayed in vayne, they ſaw them ſelues on all partes murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſlaughtered as beaſtes. Thus the hope of all flight being taken away from them, and being depriued of all good and honeſt meanes to dye with honour, they had recourſe to cryes and lamentations, which they had long forborne; and with teares (abhorred of all generous hearts) they called for mercie to <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and adiuring him to make a ſtay of further ſlaughter, and not any more to deface <q>and ſtaine the fortunate beginning of his eſtate with bloudſhed: and that he would make choyce rather to let them liue, and to reſerue them to a ſeruile eſtate of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, for the further increaſe and ornament of his triumph: then to diſgrace it ſo with the ſhew of their bloudie &amp; ſlaughtered carcaſſes: and by too too much crueltie to diſhonor this day of ioy, and the aſſurance of his eſtate with their innocent bloud, howſoeuer iuſtly ſpilt; that they had not merited any ſuch thing: that they had not deſerued the ill will and malice of the people, nor had bene iniurious to any; but that they had as friends (rather then as enemies) inhabited and conuerſed with them in the towne which was committed vnto them by <hi>Amurath:</hi> and that for their part they would not from thenceforth debarre any man from regaining their libertie, but lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe their weapons and their armes, they did proſtrate them ſelues inuocating the mercy of the vanquiſhers.</q> On all ſides were heard horrible and fearefull cryes, clamours, plaints, howlings, ſighes, threats, and lamentations full of confuſion. In the middeſt of the heate and furie of the maſſacre, <hi>Caſtriot</hi> with all his power cauſing his ſouldiers to retire, and to ſound the retrait, was eaſily moued with the pitifull voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of theſe miſerable ſuppliants: and he deferred the courſe of his proceedings till the morning following: in hope that this people ſo beſet on all ſides, and ouerwhelmed with infinite miſeries and miſchiefes, might peraduenture either by faire or fowle meanes, by flatterie or by threats, be brought and drawen to embrace the Chriſtian religion. Neuertheleſſe for all that, wiſely ordering his companies, and appointing to each man his place, he commanded to keepe good watch, for feare and doubt of ſome ſurpriſe that might be made by the enemie. Him ſelfe in the meane time rode directly to the port, accompanied with <hi>Ameſe</hi> and ſome others that followed them: and there ſent and diſpatched him away with certaine <hi>Dibrians</hi> to carrie the tidings to <hi>Dibria</hi> vnto them who were of his faction, how that <hi>Croie</hi> was his owne, and of all the reſt which paſſed: admoniſhing them all in generall to take armes, and to ſollicite their allies and neighbours to the recouerie of their libertie: and that they would not faile (during this troubleſome change, and vnexpected aſtoniſhment on all partes) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell and driue away the garriſons of the enemies: eſpecially now that <hi>Amurath</hi> did not yet know any thing, and whileſt he was occupied in the wars againſt the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians. And as for him, that as ſoone as he had cleered the towne of the Turks, &amp; ſet the ſtate thereof in good peace and quietneſſe, he would incontinently be with them, with the beſt and braueſt troopes that he could poſſibly aſſemble. The next morning
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:13368:19"/>
at the ſunne riſing, being deſirous to make an end of that which reſted vndone within the towne: he cauſed it to be cried by ſound of trumpet, that all thoſe which would be baptized, and become profeſſed Chriſtians, ſhoulde retire them ſelues neare vnto him without armes: and they ſhould both haue their liues giuen them, and be indifferently admitted to all places of charge and dignity within the towne. But all thoſe which ſhould neglect and refuſe this fauour, ſhould be held for ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and it ſhould be lawfull for euery man to puniſh them with all extremity of cruelty. The terrour of this Proclamation did not much moue their wretched ſoules and obſtinate mindes, and few there were that did hearken vnto this good and wholeſome counſaile (ſo liuely were the old preceptes of their aunceſters fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed in their feeble ſpirites: and ſo deepely had they taken roote, and were (as it<note place="margin">The obſtinacy of the Turkes.</note> were) engrauen within their bones, that they could not be diſſwaded from them.) Moſt willingly therefore did they make choiſe, that their miſerable bodies ſhould accompany their guilty ſoules to deſtruction, rather then they would enioy the exceeding clemency both of God and men. The Turkes therefore, deſiſting from prayers, for that the condition propounded vnto them by the Chriſtians, ſeemed vnto them very vnreaſonable, and hauing recourſe vnto a vaine and booteleſſe flight, they did rather delay then auoide their torment, by reaſon that the corpes du gard of armed ſouldiers diſpoſed on all the wayes, did eaſily oppreſſe them being amazed and diſperſed. And albeit that many of them enraged (as it were) when the hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous image of imminent death and deſtruction did preſent it ſelfe to their eyes, did with their naked ſwordes make them ſelues a paſſage in ſome of the ſtreets through the middeſt of their enemies: yet could they not for all that, auoide the handes of the reſt, and though they ranne here and there as birdes ſhutte vp in a cage, and did wander by all the croſſe wayes of the towne, hauing no way to eſcape, yet were they ouerthrowen by the ſouldiers comming vppon them: or elſe did they murther them ſelues with their owne weapons. For it is ſayed that ſome of them were ſlaine by their owne hands: others getting into the Temples and ſacred places to hide them ſelues, were drawen out by the ſouldiers deſirous of bloud, and were made (as it were) a ſacrifice for the common liberty. Libertie was in euery mans mouth, and euery where ſounded the ſweete name of Liberty. Many of them being not yet for feare gotten out of their houſes, but keeping them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues within dores, did there ſhedde their owne bloud, excepting ſuch as retiring them ſelues into the inner and moſt ſecrete partes and corners of their houſes, did for a time beguile the ſouldiers notwithſtanding all their wilineſſe and diligence: a great number of them alſo had refuge vnto <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> not for that the feare of ſo hideous a ſpectacle, had withdrawen them from their former intention, but onely to prolong (as long as they might) the courſe of their vnhappy liues. For this fury being appeaſed, and the tumult ceaſing within the towne, euen as <hi>Caſtriot</hi> was in making preparation to haue them to be baptized, the moſt part of them with faire intreaty and ſupplications did not ceaſe to importune him, that he would not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their wils force them therunto: that well they might faine themſelues through the feare and horror of preſent death to yeeld them ſelues to be Chriſtians, but that they could not forget the auncient lawes and ceremonies of their Elders; that they meant not obſtinately to oppoſe them ſelues nor reſiſt againſt any of his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes, though it were to preſent them with a cruell death: neuertheleſſe, that this could not enter into their thoughts, becauſe that ſuch ceremonies and traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ought to be vſed to ſuch as are willing, and not with conſtraint and violence. And they required him by the faith which he had plighted vnto them, and by the reuenge
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:13368:19"/>

For (be it ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken without preſumption) of my ſelfe I neuer doubted but that I ſhould alwayes retayne the ſame minde, and the ſelfe ſame loue and affection to my countrie: and that I ſhould be alwaies of like courage for the recouerie of our publique liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. In like manner your deſires, your vowes, and your wiſhes were in effect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with mine ioyntly, but as one and the ſame thing. For manie times (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of willingly and freely I doe delight to make often rehearſall) you did by all manners and meanes of affection and dutie conuite me vnto this charge whileſt I was yet abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding about <hi>Amurath.</hi> Peraduenture in your opinion I might ſeeme to haue beene forgetfull of my countrie, to haue forgotten mine owne honour: and it might be, you thought me careleſſe of our deliuerance and freedome, at ſuch time as I ſent you home to your houſes charged with ſorrow, without any certaine hope, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie apparance or likelihoode of anie generous or honourable thought ſeene or diſcerned in me. Certainely (my good citizens) by that diſſembled remiſſneſſe and default of mine, I prouided both for your ſuretie and mine owne ſecuritie: the eſtate of our affayres being then of that qualitie and diſpoſition, as they required rather to be put in execution, then to be conſulted on: beſides that I haue in you a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter neceſſitie rather of a bridle to reſtraine you, then of ſpurres to pricke you on to the recouerie of your libertie. True it is that I concealed from you my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations, but the cauſe why I ſo long forbare to make knowen vnto you my readie will and affection, was: not for that I either ſuſpected your loyaltie, or that I had not ſufficient knowledge of your good hearts (for your ſelues were the firſt that entred into this dangerous courſe, and made me acquainted with the ſecrets of your thoughts) but that which turned and withdrew me from it, was the frailtie of mortall men, and the inconſtancie of mens mindes: the which, as in all other actions
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:13368:21"/>
it is brittle, variable, and inconſiderate: ſo muſt it be drawen with force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and not guided by any gentle entreatie and vſage to ſeeke and purchaſe liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. For it is in nothing ſtable and conſtant, neither doth it obſerue any good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or direction, and if there fall out any the leaſt occaſion or opportunitie, which may giue any hope or plauſibilitie for the purchaſing thereof, or for the attempting of it onely: not a thouſande ſwordes, not a million of perils, not manifeſt death and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant hazard to looſe both life and goods might haue diuerted and turned vs from our purpoſe. But after that the matter once in vaine attempted, had made knowen your endeuors, either muſt you haue endured a moſt cruell puniſhment, or a bondage farre more hard and intollerable, all hope had beene quite taken from you in time to come, and the oportunitie once let ſlippe had beene loſt for euer after: ſo that this fact muſt haue bene enterpriſed once for all, and if it had not ſucceeded at the firſt, all future means to accompliſh it had bene vtterly loſt without any hope euer to returne againe. For this cauſe (I will ſpeake it freely) hardly durſt I truſt my ſelfe with my owne conceipt of my enterpriſe, neither could I thinke my ſelfe aſſured in that I had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated it to my owne thoughts: I miſtruſted leaſt my tongue, impatient of a caſe ſo important, ſhould diſcouer it to the very walles of my priuate chamber, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof is <hi>Ameſe</hi> my Nephewe, my chiefeſt friende and counſellour at that time, and the faithfull companion of my trauels, and ſome fewe beſides him, whoſe faithfull and forward aſſiſtance and diligence did vs good ſeruice in the execution of this action. For albeit we liued together and familiarly (as it were) in one and the ſame courſe of life: though we did eate at one and the ſame table, and though wee did in a manner (as it were) breath ioyntly with one and the ſame ſoule: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, neither they nor any man aliue did euer heare me mindefull of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, but onely in the warre of <hi>Hungarie:</hi> neither was there euer anie man that heard me vſe any ſpeech, or to vtter any one worde at any time, which might argue mee to be a Chriſtian or free man, till ſuch time as I ſawe and perceiued that I might freelie doe it, and without all feare of daunger. Well therefore might you (O <hi>Albanians</hi>) haue ſought and found out ſome other perſon (as this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince was neuer deſtitute of moſt excellent ſpirites) whome you might haue made the author of your libertie: and who might haue more aduanced your meanes and courages thereunto: but it pleaſed you, and it may be, God would haue it ſo, that you ſhould attend this your deliuerance rather by me, though ſomewhat with the lateſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then to go ſeeke out others, or by your owne vertue to purchaſe and obtaine it. It was not any griefe vnto me, neither did the magnanimitie of my minde, albeit nouriſhed to libertie, ſuppoſe the time any thing long or tedious, to be helde in ſo long ſubiection, and to haue my courage kept vnder by the villanous Barbarians: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I did ſtill liue in hope that you ſhould one day ſee me in the ſtate wherein I nowe am.

no leſſe then the libertie which I haue gotten and purchaſed by you. It is not I that haue giuen you this Empire and Seigniorie: it is not I that haue giuen you this citie, it is you that haue giuen it vnto mee: it was not I that did put armes into your handes, I founde you readie in armes: I found you euerie where bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſhewe of libertie, in your hearts, in your countenance, in your ſwordes, and in your launces: and (as moſt loyall tutors and gardians ordained by my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you haue put the Scepter into my hande with no leſſe faith and diligence, then as if you had kept and preſerued it for me euen till this day: and you haue brought me by your labour and carefulneſſe into the poſſeſſion of my aunceſtors without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny effuſion of bloud. Now therefore (in the name of God) doe you leade and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct me to the recouerie of the reſt which is yet remayning in the hande and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of others. The greateſt part, and in a manner the whole worke is already by you accompliſhed: <hi>Croy</hi> is recouered, and the territorie thereof wholly reduced vnder our obeiſance: the <hi>Dybrians</hi> and all the people in generall are now vnited vnto vs, the name of the enemy is baniſhed and exiled out of the countrey, onely the townes and ſtrong holdes do reſt vnſubdued. If I conſider their diſcommodities, how al places are either taken by vs, or beſieged, and howe nothing is left them but the encloſures of their walles; I haue hope of good ſucceſſe: but if I contemplate the difficultie and ſtrength of the places, and the force of the garriſons placed in them by the Tyrant, it behoueth vs either to vſe ſome notable policie to ſurpriſe them, or ſingular reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and obſtinacie in forcing them. But hereof we ſhall better and more conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently both conſult and determine, when we come vppon the place in the face of the enemie, and our armes in hande, then nowe that we are abſent, and our mindes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together doubtfull and vnreſolued. Let vs then march on and aduance our enſignes ſpeedily, let vs take vnto vs the courages of conquerours: fortune ſhall ſeconde our endeuours, which hitherto in all our actions and in all places hath ſingularly both accompanied and followed vs. <hi>Petrella</hi> is the place wee muſt firſt ſet vppon, not that the ſame is inferiour vnto others in the ſtrength and naturall ſite thereof: but for that (being neerer to this citie) I haue good hope that it will be the more terrified by the fame and report of our good fortune which we haue had at <hi>Croie.</hi> Manie are the ſpectacles which are preſented before their eyes both of your valure, and of their owne calamitie: it may happen that theſe thinges may ſomewhat moue and appale them, but if the conceite of theſe will not make them to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: that which ſhall be wanting, aſſuredly our owne reſolution and obſtinacie muſt and ſhall ſupply. For this is one thing we muſt holde reſolutely and to build vppon; That if this place be not caried and if we come not therein to the ende of our deſires, we muſt neuer thinke to returne any more vnto our houſes. Let vs trie therefore by all meanes, by arte, cunning, and policie: by paines and trauaile, by patience, by the ſworde, and by golde and ſiluer, that by our ſucceſſe in this, we may finde the beginning and commencement of our good fortune: and we may make it the firſt good ſigne and augurie of our victorie. If it pleaſe God that we enter by force, we muſt remoue all pittie and compaſſion of theſe obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Miſcreantes, and wee ought rather to vſe the victorie with all obſtinacie and ſeueritie, for the greater diſcouragement of thoſe that ſhall reſt vnſubdued. If by compoſition and without bloud, wee can by any meanes gaine it, then is it requiſite, that wee carrie our ſelues towardes them in all courteſie, and vſe them friendly and fauourably both in generall and in particular: to the intent wee may make others the more tractable, and keepe them from being too obſtinate and deſperate.</q>

            <p>This ſouldier being of a quicke ſpirite, and verie ſubtell, with ſpeeches fitte and appertinent to the purpoſe: finding this people alreadie enclyning to yeelde themſelues, brought them to ſuch reaſon as himſelfe deſired: and he tooke not the beginning of his perſwaſion concerning <hi>Scanderbeg:</hi> but in regarde of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes and great buſineſſe of <hi>Amurath</hi> vppon his diſcomfiture in <hi>Hungarie,</hi> and the conſpiracie of the Chriſtians againſt the Turkes: And then with a firme aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance he came to the inſtructions of his Captaine often times inſinuating for a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour into the mindes of the hearers the proſperous fortune of the garriſon of <hi>Croye,</hi> and the miſerable condition of the others who laie diſperſed throughout all the corners of the Prouince, and were left and abandoned for foode vnto Wolues and dogges in the open fieldes. The trueth of theſe perſwaſions beeing in parte heard, and in part ſeene with their owne eyes, they were ſoone and verie eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, and the conditions were accepted: that they ſhould freely depart with their armes, bagge and baggage: as for other preſentes they regarded not. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour therefore appointed certaine to treate with <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> vppon this point,<note place="margin">Petrella yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> and to ratifie the agreement with ſolemne oath. All matters beeing concluded and ended, the Barbarians departed: there was a newe garriſon receiued within <hi>Petrella,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Albanie</hi> being mindefull of his promiſe, after he had honoured and kindly entreated the enemies with good ſpeeches, he furniſhed them with money, horſe, and victuals, and after ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> with certaine horſemen
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:13368:22"/>
to conduct them to the frontiers of <hi>Epyre,</hi> for feare leaſt they ſhould ſuffer ſome outrage by meanes of ſecret ambuſhmentes or open violence on one ſide or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his owne followers, as diuerſe others had ſuffered the like vſage. Beholde nowe in the diſcourſe of theſe affaires, howe the exceeding and wonderfull good fortune of this Chiefetaine doth bewray it ſelfe no leſſe then his ſingular and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent<note place="margin">Scanderbeg moſt fortunate</note> vertue: and as God did ſuccour him in preſeruing him from the traines of <hi>Amurath,</hi> when he abode with him; In likecaſe I may iuſtly auerre, that at the verie time of his ſetling and reeſtabliſhment in his Signiorie, he did not onely fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour him, but did alſo fight for him. The towne of <hi>Petrella,</hi> though ſmall in<note place="margin">The ſituation of Petrella.</note> circuit, is notwithſtanding inexpugnable by reaſon of her ſituation, both for the nature of the place, and the height of the mountaine, vppon the toppe whereof it is ſeated: beſides it was aboundantly prouided of men, armes, and munition. Neuertheleſſe in the winter time (being a verie hard and vnfit ſeaſon for the ſiege of townes) it made ſo little reſiſtance againſt him, that hee loſt not in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereof ſo much as one ſouldier, nor (as the common ſaying is) a worde waſt or in vaine. Herein alſo haue we to commende his ſingular patience which ſtoode him to great purpoſe, and his bodily ſtrength, which was hardened to all trauailes, beſides the infatigable and vnwearied vigour of his ſpirite, whereby he executed all offices and dueties of charge, with great promptneſſe and celeritie. But to the matter: The fortreſſe being regayned, and all thinges neceſſarie orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and prouided, he made not anie abode there, not ſo much as a day, an houre, or anie moment of time: but at the verie inſtant truſſing vppe his baggage, hee ledde his forces againſt the other townes ſo ſpeedily, as though they had fledde away before him. All places were couered with ſnowe, the faces of his men were euen ſhronke with colde, their handes frozen, their bodies benummed and almoſt ſenſeleſſe: yet would he ſuffer no man to enter into the towne ſaue onely the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, neither would himſelfe ſet foote within it, to make others as it were aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the example which himſelfe gaue them. But one thing there is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">The properties of Scanderbeg.</note> of him of farre greater maruell, which I may not ſuffer to be forgotten, and that is, that from the firſt day in which he entred into <hi>Epyre,</hi> euen to the perfect and full recouerie of his eſtate: it was neuer knowen that he ſlept at any time full two houres in a night, which may bee reputed a miracle proper to a bodie of ſome diuine nature, and to a ſupernaturall force and vigour. It may well be that he attayned to this patience of labour, and ſufferance of hardneſſe, by a cuſtome in often watching, by daily exerciſe, and by the greatneſſe of his forces. Some doe holde (which the auncients alſo did excuſe in that great perſonage <hi>Papirius Curſor</hi>) that he was a great eater and drinker. His vſe was in fight to combat with his arme bare and naked: and he tooke no care either of heate or colde: a thing (it may be thought) more maruellous then credible to all poſteritie. But let vs nowe returne from whence we are digreſſed.</p>
            <p>The next courſe taken was directly to <hi>Petralba,</hi> diſtant 30. miles from <hi>Petrella,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Petralba, and the deſcription thereof.</note> and as much from <hi>Croy:</hi> and from <hi>Petrella</hi> to <hi>Croy</hi> was fiue and twentie miles. This caſtle is in <hi>Emathia,</hi> vpon the height of a mountaine, the which beſides that it is of ſmall entertainement, and not able to yeeld any great reliefe or ſuſtenance, can not be forced but by famine onely. Moreouer hauing the riuer of <hi>Emathy</hi> neere vnto it which waſheth the foote of the mountaine; it is the cauſe that it yeeldeth vnto the place no leſſe ornament and beautie, then defence and commoditie. No ſooner had the ſouldiers planted their enſignes before this towne, but that thoſe which helde it, did yeeld it vp by one of their companie, whom they ſent purpoſely to <hi>Scanderbeg:</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:13368:23"/>
and they had the like conditions graunted and accorded vnto them as had the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trellians:</hi> and as inuiolablie were they obſerued, certaine of the <hi>Epyrots</hi> being aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned<note place="margin">Petralba yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> them for a conuoy to their garriſon at their diſlodging from the towne againſt the violence of the countrie inhabitants. The towne being furniſhed with all things neceſſarie, ſcant had they any leaſure to breath themſelues, but that they marched on<note place="margin">Stelluſa and the deſcripion thereof.</note> with the like heate and furie to <hi>Stelluſa:</hi> being diſtant from <hi>Petralba</hi> fiue and twentie miles, from <hi>Petrella</hi> fortie, and from <hi>Croy</hi> fiftie, or thereabouts. This litle hamlet like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, notwithſtanding that it meriteth no great commendation for her greatneſſe, yet may it with good right be accounted of, by reaſon of the naturall fortification, and the pleaſantnes thereof, and the healthfulnes of the aire. In the plaine champion fields of <hi>Armathia,</hi> there runneth out a very high mountaine ſeated as if it had bene of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in the middeſt of a valley, the toppe of the ſame being excellently well enuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with walles maketh this caſtle. In this place our <hi>Epirots</hi> being arriued about the ſunne ſetting, nothing was done for that day, but they attended the day following. Early in the morning <hi>Caſtriot</hi> hauing ſent his Heraulds to the beſieged, they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but wordes, neither was there any certaine anſwere giuen them: for the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians being diſtracted into diuerſe opinions, it litle wanted but that they had fallen into a mutinie by reaſon of the obſtinacie or (to ſpeake more properly) the firme re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the Gouernour; who contradicted the others, vpon the capitulation and agreement, perſwading the multitude to ſtand to their defence. Notwithſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vanquiſhed by the greater number, and yet not willing to accept the reaſonable offers made him, he was in the end conſtrained to receiue a yoke farre more diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, vile &amp; pitifull.

Vnto theſe more then to all the reſt did the Chriſtians in all friendly ſort vſe notable bountie and liberalitie. The greater ſort of them by reaſon of their crime and treacherie committed againſt <hi>Ottoman,</hi> would not returne into their own countrie, but did ſtill continue in that place: of whom ſome were baptiſed, and the reſidue were left to their owne libertie and diſcretion to vſe their religion at their owne choice and pleaſure not any one of them wanting maintenance and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the publique and common charge.</p>
            <p>There remained yet vnrecouered the citie of <hi>Sfetigrad,</hi> the which in the Sclauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian<note place="margin">Sfetigard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged.</note> language ſignifieth, the holy citie. Thither therefore without any ſtay made at <hi>Stelluſa,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Epyre</hi> marched with his armie making all the ſpeed that might be: this towne being ſeated in the vpper <hi>Dibria</hi> on the frontiers of <hi>Albanie,</hi> vppon an high mountaine (as we haue ſaide alſo of the former) and it ſtoode aloft and verie eminent as the neſt of an Eagle, being well neere as great in compaſſe as <hi>Stelluſa.</hi> All<note place="margin">Of the antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of the chiefe townes of Epyre.</note> theſe places by vs before mentioned had not any founders of any great antiquitie: for thoſe which the ancient kings of <hi>Macedon</hi> and <hi>Epyre,</hi> and other ſtrange Princes had ſometimes builded; as <hi>Meandria, Heraclia, Togla, Nicopolis, Echina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Leucas</hi> and certain others: they had bene deſtroyed and razed by the enemies of the Latines, or (as we may more fitly terme them) the firebrandes and plagues of mankinde, the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Gallogretians,</hi> at ſuch time as they inuaded and ouerwhelmed the whole world. This was the reaſon that ſome of the inhabitants of the countrie, &amp; the particular Lords of places long time after that being deſirous to recule and reaſſemble in one the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude moſt miſerably diſperſed, and to reduce it into ſome forme of a Prouince: for that they knewe it to be a matter of ſome difficultie to reſtore the reliques and ruines of thoſe auncient townes; and if they were repayred, yet they would be neuertheleſſe

And although that <hi>Croy</hi> (as the capitall and chiefe citie of the realme) be farre more beautifull and larger, beyond all compariſon, then all the others: neuertheleſſe I find that he which founded it was one named <hi>Charles,</hi> a man rich and very wealthy, of the noble family of the <hi>Tholoyes,</hi> the which (at the ſame time that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> did enioy the ſouereigntie of <hi>Epyre</hi>) had<note place="margin">Scuria or Scodra.

            <p>Aſſoone as <hi>Caſtriot</hi> was come in ſight of the enemie, after he had deuided his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies ech in his quarter, and that he had ſet good watch and ward on all partes of the<note place="margin">Sfetigard ſum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moned by Scanderbeg.</note> campe, he demanded parley with them of the towne, and to prouoke them the more by examples, he made knowen and put them in mind from point to point of all that he had done at <hi>Croie, Petrella, Petralba &amp; Stelluſa:</hi> and chiefly of his liberalitie &amp; gratious vſage, and entreatie of the garriſon of <hi>Stelluſa:</hi> and on the other ſide of the captiuitie of the gouernor of that place: whom they ſhould ſhortly ſee executed with others that were likewiſe obſtinate. This meſſage did aſtoniſh euerie one of them, &amp; aboue all, the captain of the garriſon: who hauing before his eyes the ſignes &amp; markes of other mens fortunes, durſt not beginne to declare and open his aduiſe, nor yet to make anſwer to the enemie, miſtruſting the inconſtancie of the common multitude, and the mutable<note place="margin">The oration of acommon ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to the garriſon of Sfetygrad perſwading them to hold good againſt Scanderbeg.</note> mindes of the popular ſort being for the moſt part nothing reſolute. Wherefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing honorably receiued and feaſted the Herauld: he addreſſed himſelfe to his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers with great modeſtie and beganne thus to ſpeake vnto them. How thinke you valiant men &amp; faithful ſouldiers? or what ſhall we ſay to this ambaſſade of our enemy? Then one of the ſtanders by (wel perceiuing the intent and meaning of the Gouernor by his ſpeeches) with his ſword drawen, and ſhaking it aloft as he held it in his hande: Captaine (quoth he) ſeeing thou doeſt terme vs valiant and faithfull: and doeſt <q>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> for our enemie: this my ſword ſhall make anſwere for vs all. What reaſon hath any man to alleadge here vnto vs ſo preciſely &amp; expreſly that which hath paſſed at <hi>Croy</hi> and at <hi>Stelluſa?</hi> do they thinke thereby to feare and terrifie the courage of men free and reſolute? As great diuerſitie as there is in the countenances of men, and as different as are their viſages: ſo great varietie is there in the habilitie and dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of their ſpirites. Ech man is wiſe to himſelfe: or ech man is fooliſh in his owne actions. Neither the Petrellians, nor the Stelluſians receiued any lawes of vs, nor were they commaunded by vs: no more ſhall they commaund or preſcribe lawes vnto vs. Let vs take heed that the examples of theſe ſlaues ſo baſe &amp; infamous do not any way enter into our harts ſo valiant and generous. Couragious mindes do highly diſdaine, not onely in caſes that are ſhamefull and reproachfull, but euen in honeſt actions, to imitate the deedes of other perſons: but ech man liueth after his owne guiſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. Let it be that the Gouernor of <hi>Stelluſa</hi> ſhould be ſacrificed before our eyes, and that his companions ſhould be likewiſe maſſacred: what, do you thinke that we alſo ſhall die in their bodies? or that our ſpirits ſhall be extinguiſhed in theirs? or is it likely that our blood can be ſpilt in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?

and their libertie, haue equally contemned both gold, ſiluer, the ſword, and all things elſe which the wretched nature and condition of mankind doth either affect or is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of. Returne therfore meſſenger backe againe to our enemie, and carrie this meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to thy Generall from a priuate ſouldier: tell him, That if this be his intention, to impoſe vpon vs any termes of commaund, let him ſhew vs the ſtrength of his arme which as yet by men of courage is nothing feared nor redoubted: it may be that if god be not for vs, he may by force bring vs in ſubiection: but by perſwaſions of good words to draw vs thereunto I am ſure he ſhal neuer do it. Moreouer it ſeemeth in this caſe that your <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> is not the man he is reported to be, namely: of a ſpirit gentle and courteous, readie to pardon, and no leſſe iuſt to his enemies then to his owne. For wherfore then is the gouernor of <hi>Stelluſa</hi> detained priſoner? who for his king, for his faith, for his libertie: freelie, valiantly, iuſtly, and as became an honeſt man hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered his mind and opinion? wherfore is hereſerued to be butchered by the hands of the executioner? he hath not deſerued to be put to the ſword nor to ſuffer death: who ſo honorably hath neglected his owne ſafetie, and ſought the hazard of death for the preſeruation of his libertie.</q> The ſouldier was heard with great admiration of all of them without the interruption of any perſon, till he had ended his ſpeech of his owne accord and diſpoſition. Incontinently there beganne a great tumult of infinite peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple aſſembled round about him, clattering their ſwordes and bucklers together with great noiſe: and after this ſigne and token followed a mightie clamor of ſuch as did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and approue his diſcourſe. The Turks Gouernor being the better aſſured and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to ſee his ſouldiers ſo well reſolued, licenced the Chriſtian Ambaſſador to depart: and at the ſame inſtant bending all his care and ſtudie to prouide for the ſure and ſafe keeping of the towne, he commanded his ſouldiers to withdraw themſelues euerie one to his place, and where his deuoyre did call him. And although order had bene taken before in manie pointes for the defence of the wall: he altered notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the whole order and courſe thereof, and diſpoſed otherwiſe of it, either aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting or changing things as neede required. Beſides in the middeſt of his prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he would euer and among vſe exhortations and good encouragements: telling them, That they now gaue manifeſt proofe and ſhew of that wherof himſelf had euer<note place="margin">The Gouernor of Sfetigrade encorageth his ſouldiers ſeeing them reſolute to ſtand to their defence.</note> conceiued a certaine hope and aſſurance: that the examples of other places which had ſo faintly &amp; ſo cowardly yeelded their necks to the yoke of the enemie ought ſo much the more to increaſe their conſtancy and perſeuerance: that they ſhould thinke vpon the great rewards and recompence prepared for them by <hi>Amurath,</hi> if that they alone <q>in all <hi>Epire,</hi> and in the middeſt of the diſloialtie and tretcherie of all others, did man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſtand to the defence of the name, the libertie, and the empire of the <hi>Ottomans.</hi> On the other ſide if want of courage or cowardiſe ſhould carrie them from regard of their dutie, they ſhould haue iuſt occaſion to expect from him farre more rigorous and hard intreatie then thoſe of <hi>Petrella</hi> or <hi>Stelluſa:</hi> for that the infidelitie of the others was in apparance more excuſable, becauſe they ſeeing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues beſieged, &amp; on all parts hard beſet by the enemie, and in the very hart of the enemies countrie, ſeemed to be euen forced to render themſelues: whereas they, being but vpon the limits and frontiers of the enemies dominions, &amp; being couered &amp; protected with a place of greater ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth and inpregnable, could not alleage thoſe vaine excuſes and faint pretences: eſpecially for that euen in an inſtant they might haue ſuccours from their Prince, wherwith to make their enemies forſake &amp; raiſe their ſiege. A further co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort he gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this alſo, that the winter (an vnfit ſeaſon to beleager any place) would make their trauels but ſhort &amp; of ſmall continuance, for that he firmly beleeued, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the enemies ſhold haue notice of their laſt reſolution, they would not in haſt make any attempt againſt them,</q>

nor be ſo fooliſh hardy as to thinke to force their walles, but would retire themſelues incontinently.</p>
            <p>To theſe perſwaſions he added a deed of no leſſe prudence and policie, and that<note place="margin">The gouernour of Sfetigrade putteth all the Chriſtians out of the towne.</note> was (for feare of ſome treacherous mutinie and conſpiracie) to put out of the towne all the Chriſtians and ancient Citizens: of whom diuerſe had bene ſuffred to remaine both there and in other townes by the <hi>Sultan,</hi> who had appointed the ſuburbes for them to lodge in. Theſe things thus prepared and diſpoſed, they within the towne did reſolutely attend the enemie. Whileſt theſe things were in doing, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> hauing intelligence of the anſwer of the defendants, and the artificiall oration of the ſouldier, ſmiling at the conceipt which he had propounded, he ieaſted at it in theſe termes. Behold (ſayed he a braue ſouldier if his deedes be anſwerable to his wordes: <q>but God willing we will ſend him alſo to keepe companie with thoſe happie ſoules of the <hi>Stelluſians.</hi> This ſaid, he cauſed the Gouernour and other priſoners to be brought before him, vnto whom, preſenting the image of the crucifix, ſome were conuerted: <hi>Deſdrot</hi> and the reſidue were executed.</q> When they came to conſultation concerning<note place="margin">Deſdrot the Gouernor of Stelluſa exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</note> the aſſailing of the towne, there were three ſeuerall opinions ech differing from other. The firſt was, that there ought not anie attempt to be made at that time againſt the citie; for that all places were couered with froſt &amp; ſnowe in ſuch ſort that it made the mountains inacceſſible, the ſouldier being hardly able to keepe his footing: for which cauſe, they held it much better to deferre the ſiege till the ſpring, by reaſon of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties of the winter. Others were of the minde that choice ſhould be made of the<note place="margin">Diuerſity of opi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nions touching the ſiege of Sfetigrade.</note> beſt and moſt picked ſouldiers; that ſcaling ladders, artillerie, and ſuch like inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of aſſault ſhould be prouided, and that the obſtinacie of the defendants ſhould be encountred with the like in the aſſailants: and that they ought not to take any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time of breathing or delay vpon the matter: after the manner of ſmall and ſillie birdes, who vſe to attend the pleaſantneſſe and temperature of the ſpring tide: that they ought in any caſe to beware how they did giue time to the enemie wherby they might be ſuccoured and relieued by <hi>Amurath.</hi> But <hi>Moſes</hi> (folowing the middle way &amp; a meane courſe betweene both the one and the other of theſe opinions) did conclude; that neither ought they to attempt the aſſault of the towne, nor yet to quit and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the ſiege: and that this was to be done in an other manner and faſhion then they had a duiſed, and that was, that thoſe forces (which they were to entertaine and to keepe in a readines vpon the borders for other accidents and occurrencies, might alſo ſerue and commodiouſly ſupplie the neceſſities and wants of the campe: ſo as the ſiege neede not altogether to be broken vp, but they might in the meane time hold the enemie ſhut vp within their hold: and ſo by litle and litle prolong the ſeruice to a time of more oportunitie, and ſo ſhould they take from them all leiſure and meanes to take ſpirit and courage vnto themſelues. This opinion being ſo indifferent was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally approued, and the execution thereof committed vnto the author thereof by <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> who cauſed to come thither the regiment of two thouſand horſe (which<note place="margin">Moſes left to keepe the ſiege of Sfetigrade.</note> was not farre off) all well appointed and verie willing to the ſeruice: and he adioined vnto them another thouſand, leauing <hi>Moſes</hi> with all theſe forces to continue there before the fortreſſe. The reſidue of the armie with enſignes diſplayed retired to <hi>Croie:</hi> there alſo a councell being held, the opinions were verie different touching the ſum and principall point of the whole warre; the moſt of them being verie vnwilling and greatly grieued and diſcontented to quitte and leaue their armes, but did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwad him to follow the victorie, and to inuade the enemies countrie, and to winne ſomething from the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire.

ſouldiers endure them, and therewith all the fieldes all parched and dried vp with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame colde ſo as they would not be able to yeeld them any food or paſture for their horſes. <hi>Caſtriot</hi> aſſenting vnto this latter opinion, to the intent they ſhould ſee how he tendered the ſafetie and good of his ſouldiers, and that during the time of this delaie he might the better intend to the fortifying of the countrey which he had conquered, licenſed all men to depart hauing firſt rendred thanks vnto his ſouldiers in this or the like language:</p>
            <p>I know not (my companions) whether I ſhould firſt or laſt praiſe and commend in<note place="margin">The oration of Scanderbeg vnto his Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and ſouldiers.</note> you your vertue or your good fortune: this latter hath bene ſtirred vp by the former, and the former hath ſuccoured &amp; furthered the latter, and by her induſtrie and celerity (a thing in warfare verie requiſite) hath made your counſels and your endeuors all one <q>and equall. For this cauſe, I haue conceiued a moſt aſſured hope and preſage of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture renowme and glorious name of <hi>Albanie,</hi> and of your honour and reputation. What is there wherein fortune can hereafter refuſe vs? what is there but your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will ſurmount and compaſſe? It is yet ſcant the thirteth day ſince that I (full of doubt and vncertaintie, and almoſt as one forgotten or vnknowen, by reaſon of my long abſence and pilgrimage) did happily arriue and ſet foote in this my natiue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie poſſeſſed with infidels and miſcreants: of whom (<hi>Sfetigrad</hi> excepted) there is not nowe remaining in this prouince, neither the name, nor (if I may ſo ſpeake) not ſo much as the ſmell or odour. It is God to whom firſt and before all we ought to render thankes, that had ſo blinded the eyes, and ſhut vp the vnderſtanding of our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, cauſing them to deliuer into our hands the poſſeſſion of ſo goodly and ſtrong for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes without any ſlaughter and blooſhed: next of all, your painfull patience and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance hath merited great praiſe and commendations, which hath deſpiſed ſo many diſcommodities preſenting themſelues before you, as the menaces of the heauens, and the iniurie and roughnes of the winter, and yet without turning your faces either one way or other, till ſuch time as your noble thoughts and deſires long ſince conceiued in your hartes were fully ſatisfied and contented. I do well like and allowe your wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mindes on both parties, as well thoſe who iudge it needfull to purſue our victory, as thoſe alſo who thinke it good for a while to deferre our proceedings. For albeit there be nothing that ſhould ſtay the man that is magnanimious and valiant, but that vertue is accuſtomed to make her ſelfe wayes through fire and water (as the ſaying is) and through all places how ſoeuer vnacceſſible: notwithſtanding ſo long as no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience do happen vs by our delay, you may well (without any wrong to your ſelues) haue a care to your bodies, and to conſider that they are made of no other then a humaine conſtitution. Retire you therefore victorious in a good and happie houre to breath and refreſh your ſelues: ſo ſhall you returne more gallant, ſtrong, and luſty, in a ſeaſon more temperate, to newe ſeruices and expeditions: then ſhall all of you haue the free vſe and your full of warres, of labours and trauels: then ſhall you finde a continuall emploiment in armes: then ſhall you receiue largely the paye and wages which you haue nowe ſo well deſerued. For if <hi>Ottoman</hi> ſit ſtill and doe ſuffer vs, to wage warre without diſturbance (as we haue begun alreadie) then will we ouerrun, ſacke, burne the tirant his countrie, and aſſay vpon ſome of the neighbour-garriſons: if we can get to be maſters of them. But if the <hi>Sultan</hi> (which I thinke moſt likely) doe proclaime warre againſt vs, we will then aduiſe our ſelues in the field by the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the enemie, how and in what manner we are to proceede, and to demeane our ſelues againſt him. Neuertheles howſoeuer we haue occaſion of ſeruice elswhere, it will behoue vs to giue the firſt attempt againſt <hi>Sfetigrad,</hi> and there to employ and bend our firſt forces: For I hold it no leſſe ignominious then vnſufferable, that the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:13368:25"/>
infidels ſhould continue there ſetled and vnremoued to the great reproch &amp; diſhonor of the <hi>Epirots.</hi> But it is neceſſarie at this time, that we temporiſe for a ſeaſon, for feare leaſt in attempting with too great obſtinacie the deſtruction and ruine of <hi>Sfetigrade:</hi> if the action ſhould fall out to be vaine, &amp; our attempt fruſtrate; we ſhould retire with ſhame as ouercome and vanquiſhed, and the enemie growing inſolent would learne in a ſmall time to contemne and deſpiſe our forces: and ſo ſhould we haue to contend not againſt men onely, but euen againſt the heauens. I haue heard ſome ancient Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines highly blamed, who by imprudence and want of experience in the arte military haue loſt goodly armies, more by the diſcommodities of things then by the ſword &amp; force of the enemie. But beſide all this, we haue the feaſt of the natiuitie of Chriſt our ſauiour now at hand, &amp; I am not of the mind that any thing ſhould be enterpriſed du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring theſe feſtiual daies, nor that we ought to depriue any of life in a time wherein we our ſelues haue receiued life, &amp; were brought vnto the light, but rather by our vowes and daily prayers (I may often repeat it) let vs yeeld thanks vnto God in all reſpectes for our liberty, for our eſtate and empire, for our wiues, for our children, for our ſelues recouered &amp; freed from the bondage of our enemies. For my part (my good friends) if there be any thing wherein I am not able to be thankfull: I proteſt vnto you it is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in that you haue brought me theſe excellent gages of ſo many gallant youthes, and haue honored me with the preſence of ſo many valiant &amp; braue Captains, whoſe companie is very agreeable and acceptable vnto me. My minde doth promiſe it ſelfe great matters, and all great good hap by the aide and aſſiſtance of ſuch leaders. It is they who will giue me the meanes, themſelues will giue me the matter and occaſion whereby one day I ſhall be able to be thankefull vnto you according to the worthines of your deſerts. At this time if there be any thing which may purchaſe you honor or reputation: ſpeake it freely, vtter your thoughts and open your minds vnto me. For I aſſure you the acknowledgement of the greatneſſe of your ſeruices, whereby I am bound vnto you, ſhall neuer faile nor be wanting in me.</q>

            <p>The meaner ſort of people, and ſome alſo of good qualitie, became ſo audatious by reaſon of this ſpeech, &amp; ſo ſhamleſſe, that (as if they had feared leaſt one of them ſhould haue ſtepped before the other to make their demaundes) flocking together in great troupes, and preſſing neere about him very rudely: they were not aſhamed to make diuerſe requeſts vnto him according to their ſeuerall humors &amp; affections, ſome cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to haue the pay of horſemen, ſome of footmen. Others deſired money &amp; horſes; and ſome deſired rents, reuenues &amp; liuings: and many who vpon the change of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, had bene ſpoiled of their patrimony by the Turkes to giue it vnto others, were importunate to be reſtored vnto their poſſeſſions. That which could conueniently be done &amp; without contention was liberally granted them: the reſt which could not be without the iniurie of ſome other, was referred till ſome further oportunitie. The Captaines being diſmiſſed, &amp; <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> being entred into the towne with his own traine (for that there were many which followed him, eſpecially his Nephewes and the Princes of his bloud.) The firſt thing that he did was, to cauſe to be enrolled and admitted into the communion of the Chriſtian faith, by the Sacrament of holy Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,<note place="margin">Ameſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his companions Baptiſed.</note> 
               <hi>Ameſe</hi> &amp; ſome other of his companions, who came with him from <hi>Hungarie,</hi> and a great multitude alſo of Turkes, which were yet remaining at <hi>Croy</hi> and at other places: the ſame hauing bene before left vndone for the haſt which they had to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the warre. The ſolemnitie hereof being ioyned with the feaſt of Chriſtmas, was celebrated with great ioy for many daies together. The inhabitants of the countrey both in publique &amp; in priuate did ſend him according to the cuſtome, many preſents.

            <p>This reſt did not <hi>Caſtriot</hi> inioy any time of long continuance, for euen in the chiefeſt<note place="margin">The Turkes in Epire aſſemble in armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Moſes.</note> time of the feaſt, &amp; in their greateſt mirth: behold there came newes on a ſudden from <hi>Moſes,</hi> how that the Turks of that prouince which had fled into the places next adioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with a great troupe of their confederats &amp; no ſmall number of the common ſort gathered together, were comming with all ſpeede poſſible to ſurpriſe him. Vpon this occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> himſelf haſtned preſently away, becauſe if it ſhould happen that he going before ſhould be drawn far off by the enemy, he feared leaſt either he ſhould be conſtrained to leaue &amp; abondon the enterpriſe of <hi>Sfetigrade:</hi> or if he did determine to hazard the fight before the wals, he might be incloſed in the midſt betweene them and thoſe of the town.

The princes of Epyre aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble in a generall counſell and Parliament at Liſſa, they elect Scanderbeg both king of Epyre, and chiefe Generall of their forces.

Turkes againſt Scanderbeg: who mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with him, ouercommeth him in a ſet battell, and then ouerrunneth and ſpoileth the Turkish Territories. The peace concluded between Amurath and the Hungarians is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the perſwaſions of Iulian the Cardinal &amp; Popes legat, who cauſeth the king of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie and the Chriſtians, to enter into league againſt the Turkes.

Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg marcheth with an Army of 30000. to ioine with the Hungarians, but is hindered by the trecherie of the Deſpot of Miſia.

of the diſcourſe of the whole action, and of the reuolt of the <hi>Albanois,</hi> and aboue all of that ſubtell and wily deuiſe, whereby hee had gotten the falſe letters from the Secretary (for this no more then the reſidue) could be long concealed from him. The maruell and aſtoniſhment of a deede ſo audacious and deſperate, and of a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, as it fell out, ſo ſodaine and vnexpected, did ſo binde vp the vſe of his tongue, and repreſſed his ſpeech within him, that he was not able to ſpeake any one word. Notwithſtanding after a while, the paſſion being ſomewhat moderated, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to diſgorge it ſelfe, and to breake forth in words and ſpeaches: ſometimes with threates and menaces, and ſometimes with complaints and exclamations, he did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt<note place="margin">Amurath mightily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed vpon the reuolt of Scanderbeg.</note> and ſwallow vp with all poſſible and continuall vehemency this his wrath and indignation.

That there was neuer any ſtraunger which had receiued ſo good entertainement and nouriture in his Court,</q> neither had the vertue of any Alien bene ſo highly recompenced and ſo honourably rewarded. Againe in one and the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant faining and diſſembling to the vtmoſte of his power, and extreame <q>diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and impatiency of griefe and ſorrow, hee would exalt the loialty of his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and nobles, and would often exclaime, and with a loud voice affirme, that this notwithſtanding was a great good hap and benefit both for him and for the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, to ſee him ſelfe freed and diſcharged from ſo waighty a burthen as is domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call fraud and treaſon: that it might be, he ſhould haue bene ſurpriſed with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poyſon farre more daungerous, and with ſome miſchiefe of greater dammage and inconuenience, if this plague ſhould haue beene ſuffered to grow or to continue in his houſe any longer time: that nothing ſhould now trouble his minde, and for this fact, hee doubted not but it would aske vengeaunce both of God and man: it being vnpoſſible that he ſhould ſuffer ſuch a crime to remaine vnpuniſhed, by which, contrary to all right and equity, with ſo wicked and lewd a minde, he hadde giuen that victory to the Chriſtians in <hi>Hungarie.</hi> For if he had had any cauſe or occaſion of reuenge againſt him, or any colour or pretence of iuſt diſcontentment, for the detayning of his patrimony from him, and the inheritaunce of his fathers kingdome: what could his Army doe to that, which with all horrour and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty he had brought to the Butchery, and had made it neither more nor leſſe, then as a ſacrifice to the enemies?

            <p>With ſuch like diſcourſes did the <hi>Sultan</hi> enflame the hearts of the Barbarians, who were already of them ſelues ſufficiently animated againſt him. But nowe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings being brought one ſtill vppon an other from the partes of <hi>Epyre,</hi> it did more violentlie aggrauate and exaſperate his ſorrow at ſuch time as it was tolde him that <hi>Croie</hi> was taken by <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> that he was poſſeſſed of the other places and ſtrong holdes of like waight and conſequence, that the garriſons were ſlaine and deſtroyed, and in briefe, that the whole eſtate of his aunceſtours was remitted and reduced vnder his power and gouernment, with the incredible fauour and good liking of all the nation. Now albeit theſe matters went neare the heart of <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and did extreamely grieue him; yet hauing in a manner put all other things out of his minde, he bent and conuerted all his thoughtes to the warre of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie.</hi> There was not any other matter or ſubiect of quarrell or enmity thought on, but that onely was it which all men did aduiſe him to proſecute: and which both the deſire of euery man in particular, and the publique vowes and prayers of all in generall did earneſtly long and wiſhe for. Yet did the diuerſe and variable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of the greateſt Captaines, hold the minde of the old man in ſome doubt and ſuſpence: ſome of them who would not be perſwaded there was any daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,<note place="margin">Amurath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulteth with his chiefetaines, whether it were more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to war vpon Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirots, or vpon the Hungari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> till ſuch time as they ſhould ſee all ſubdued by <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> were of this minde; that it was beſt to marche with all their forces againſt the Hungarians, and that they ought not by faintneſſe and cowardiſe to leaue the euent and triumph of all the warre, vnto thoſe who hadde vanquiſhed and were conquerours but in part one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and yet that neither had they hadde that aduantage and victory of their fellowes, but onely by the treaſon and fellony of his owne followers. Furthermore that there was a great difference and no compariſon to be made betweene the force of one Baſſa, with a few vauntcurrers of ſome twenty thouſand, in regard of all the <q>puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunce of <hi>Ottoman,</hi> and of the flower of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> and the huge forces which the <hi>Sultan</hi> hadde for the guard of his perſon, that theſe were not vſed nor accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be ouercome and conquered.</q> But others who did feare ſome greater ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and miſchiefe, were of a contrary aduiſe and opinion: affirming, that by how <q>much the more the former did excuſe the misfortune of the Baſſa, laying it vppon the diſloyaltie of <hi>Scanderbeg:</hi> ſo much the more was hee to be blamed in regard of the ſmall number of the enemies; for that <hi>Huniades</hi> with leſſe then the moity and one halfe of their number, and without any bloud of his ſouldiours, had giuen them ſo grieuous a checke and diſcomfiture. And whereas they compared the Baſſa his forces, to the royall army, and the greatneſſe of the imperiall hoaſt which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended ſo highly: theſe on the contrary did alleadge and willed them to conſider, the greatneſſe of the power of <hi>Vladiſlaus,</hi> with the renowme of all <hi>Hungarie</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> beſides the ſuccours of the Italians guyded and conducted by <hi>Iulian</hi> the legate Apoſtolique, and the ſtrength and forces of the Almaines: all which hadde not as yet any thing entermedled in this warre, but in very great deuotion did attend the occaſion to enter into this warre with their vtmoſt power and ability. Beſides that, the Chriſtians would not now in time of neede and extremity, leaue or forſake the <hi>Deſpot,</hi> whoſe cauſe they had already ſo fauoured and vndertaken, till ſuch time as they had fully enſtalled and ſettled him in the ſeate of his aunceſtors. And laſt of all, that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> who had newly declared him ſelfe for their enemy, was not to be deſpiſed and contemned, that there was none of them but knew very well of what and how great ſpirite and courage the man was, and with what good fortune (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his ſingular experience in the warres) he was euer accompanied. That hauing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:13368:28"/>
in a moment extinguiſhed the name of his aduerſaries,</q> he was now reentred and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed of al the eſtate of his father, without any charge or loſſe ſuſtained: then what would hee doe hereafter when he had ſettled and aſſured the affaires of his Realme, and gained the hearts and good willes of his ſubiects? That it was not to be doubted but he would ſtirre vp all Princes Chriſtian to enter into Armes, and would ſpare no trauels, dangers, nor watchfull labours to exhort and wring from him daily, ſome part or peece of his Empire. That it would argue great ſimplicity in the middeſt of ſo many enemies, both before and behinde and on all ſides, and in the middeſt of ſo many forces, to looke for any other, then a very bad and moſt vnfortunate iſſue. The wiſeſt way therefore and moſt expedient was, for once to yeelde vnto Fortune, for feare leaſt ſhee did often triumphe ouer them, and to diſcouer and lay open vnto her one part of their body, for the better couering and ſafety of that which was moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect and expoſed to her violence and aſſaults. That warres are guided rather by time, then by force of armes, that they ought not to take it grieuouſly to render <hi>Miſia</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Deſpot,</hi> to the intent they might by that meanes purchaſe a litle leiſure, and (as it were) a time of breathing from ſo many loſſes and dammages ſuſtained by the wars. But why ſhould they ſpeake of rendring <hi>Miſia,</hi> when indeede it would be but lent him for a ſeaſon? For at any time they might take it backe againe, and with more eaſe and facility, then it ſhould be yeelded or giuen vnto them.</p>
            <p>Theſe conſiderations did greatly induce <hi>Amurath,</hi> being before in doubt and vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainety,<note place="margin">Amurath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolueth and concludeth a peace with the Hungarians.</note> to allow of this aduiſe and to doe thereafter. Notwithſtanding fearing to be noted of puſillanimity and baſenes of courage, if he ſhould ſo ſoone and eaſily condiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to this opinion: after he had preciſely debated and diſcuſſed many reaſons and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments both on the one part and the other; in the end he yeelded, and (as it were) by a kind of conſtraint ſubſcribed to this laſt concluſion. There was ſent therefore an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage to the Hungarians with offers of <hi>Miſia</hi> vnto the Chriſtians, and of truce for ten yeares, according as themſelues had demanded. <hi>Huniades</hi> who by reaſon of the weakenes and infirmity of the others, was in a manner left alone to mannage all the affaires both of peace and of war, perceiuing his troupes to be vnfit for the warres, did not refuſe nor prolong the conditions offered by the Turks. There be ſome notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding who affirm, that that great lord &amp; fauorit of <hi>Amurath</hi> who (as we haue ſaid) was taken priſoner by <hi>Iancus,</hi> beſides, the ſumme of 40000. crowns agreed vpon for his ran ſome, had aduiſed to demaund <hi>Miſia</hi> of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> aſſuring him that he would not refuſe to grant any thing, by reaſon of the diſcomfiture &amp; ouerthrow of his <hi>Baſſa.</hi> This being an eſpeciall proofe thereof, becauſe in the preparation of his prouiſions for the wars, this word had eſcaped from him amongſt his familiars, that he would accord with the Chriſtians, the which he did accordingly with the ambaſſadours,<note place="margin">Miſia reſtored to the Deſpot by Amurath.</note> whom <hi>Huniades</hi> ſent vnto him for the concluſion &amp; ratificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the agrement. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is (as ſome ſay) that <hi>Amurath</hi> hauing had perfect notice afterwardes, of the piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full eſtate of our forces, it litle wanted but he had run mad for rage and anger: and he tooke ſuch an extreame griefe thereat, that with the teares euen trickling downe his checkes, he lamented that a victory ſo certaine and aſſured, through a vaine and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh feare ſhould eſcape him, and be taken out of his handes.</p>
            <p>Out of <hi>Albany</hi> all this while there came no new tidings, but onely of certaine roades and falſe alarmes made vppon the confines of the Turkiſh Empire, by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion whereof, <hi>Ottoman,</hi> both for the diſcommodity of the winter, and becauſe he had not yet well digeſted in his hart the peace of <hi>Hungary,</hi> who (as it was reported) were daily as yet in armes, till the <hi>Deſpotte</hi> were fully and entirely eſtabliſhed in his eſtate, did put ouer the affaires of <hi>Epyre</hi> to another time of more opportunity, and caried
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:13368:28"/>
him ſelfe according to the time. For he was ſo extreamely perplexed and troubled in his thoughts, as he would daily walke vp and downe by himſelfe alone, imagining &amp; deuiſing from day to day vppon the variety and diuerſity of the cauſes and reaſons which brought vpon him, and continued theſe new impediments and hinderaunces one after an other, to the great good, welfare, and encreaſe of the Chriſtians affaires. The which (God be praiſed) did daily grow better and better and were in good reſt and happy eſtate. For this is a thing moſt aſſured, that the roughneſſe and intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancy of the cold and froſty weather, and the doubtfull faith of the Hungarians, did at that time yeelde our people great matter and cauſe of quiet. But the affaires of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> being now compounded and ſettled by the retrait of the Hungarians, and the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being paſt; what was it that then did hinder <hi>Amurath,</hi> that hee did not preſently make ſhew of his hatred againſt <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> and ſeeke ſome notable kinde of reuenge vpon him, in diſcharge of that malice, which had ſo long boiled in his ſtomacke? For before the thirtieth day of Iune, there was no motion of any war againſt him. It may be peraduenture that the courage of the olde man being abated by his loſſe in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie,</hi> he made more reckonning and accompt of his caſe then of the loſſe of <hi>Epyre,</hi> or of all the iniuries receiued by <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Caſtroit</hi> hauing taken his leaue of <hi>Moſes,</hi> returned from <hi>Dibria</hi> to <hi>Croie,</hi> where, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exempted for a while from the trauelles of warre (for the time would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him otherwiſe) he ſpent the better part of the winter in prouiding for the ciuil af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the weale publique, and in ordering the eſtate of particular occaſions: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uppon<note place="margin">1443.</note> ſeeing the ſpring to approach and draw on, he tooke with him <hi>Ameſe,</hi> and ſome few horſe beſides, and went to leauie certaine forces, and hauing made a muſter and taken the fielde with ſixe thouſand men, he drew ſtraight to <hi>Sfetigrade.</hi> But what ſhould he doe there? As the place was nothing changed in difficulty, no more was the enemy altered in obſtinacy. Neither menaces nor faire wordes would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite any thing. Artillery or other engines hee hadde none, and if hee had brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, it might be they had ſerued ſomewhat to abaſh and terrifie them, but litle or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would they haue profited him for the recouery of the place. On the other ſide to try his fortune with the manifeſt perill of his men, and (as it were) with their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and vtter ruine, ſeemed vnto him a courſe of great raſhneſſe and temcrity. For this cauſe according to the beſt counſell and opinion, whereunto the greater part al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo<note place="margin">The countrey about Sfeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade ſpoiled and haried.</note> did aduiſe him, leauing for a ſeaſon all care of <hi>Sfetigrade,</hi> hee marched elſe where with his campe, with intent to amplifie and enlarge the limittes and borders of his dominions. But firſt of all he ſpoyled and deſtroyed all things that bare fruite about the towne: depriuing the beſieged of the benefite and profite of all the champion, and not leauing them any thing, but the onely bare and naked encloſure of their walles.

bene the auncient ſubiects of his aunceſtors? For this cauſe, commaunding his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes to march, he turned his fury and rigour to other places.</p>
            <p>There was in this prouince a goodly open and large country and circuit of ground, maruellouſly pleaſant, and wonderfully well peopled, with many townes and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughes alſo, very plentifully inhabited. Thoſe of the countrey doe call it <hi>Moerea,</hi>

Thitherwardes <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> leading his army, did adde the ſame to his dominion: paſſing beyond the boundes whereof <hi>Iohn</hi> his father was poſſeſſed. There was not any where an enemy to be found in all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: for the Turkes before that time either had bene expelled, or had willingly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded and forſaken thoſe partes.

Oftentimes comming and going to <hi>Croy,</hi> he would viſite all other places of importance, and be euer riding and courſing here and there in and out con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually: ſeldome or neuer was he idle, but he would be preſent euery where, and there was no place or corner but he tooke diligent and ſpeciall notice of, mountains, hils, forreſtes, thickets, caues, dennes, and ſecrete lurking holes. All his thoughtes and deuiſe was vppon the warres, to ſee before hand how he might one day with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle loſſe of his men, make head againſt an enemy ſo puiſſant and mighty. That litle leaſure that was left him, was wholly ſpent in dayly roades and inuaſions to ſpoile and waſt the territory of the Pagans. He hated nothing ſo much, as that his ſouldiers<note place="margin">An Army not to continue long in a place.</note> ſhould corrupt them ſelues with idleneſſe, hauing this ſentence of <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> daily in his mouth, that it was not good for an Army to continue long in one place, but that the often chaunge and ſhifting of their place and campe, was much more laudable, and would enable and make them farre better diſpoſed to all the actions and ſeruices Military.</p>
            <p>Theſe things could not be ſo handled, but that <hi>Amurath</hi> muſt needs haue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them: for by this time there came vnto him many meſſengers from <hi>Pharſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Macedonie:</hi> ſo as all partes of his pallace were filled vp with outcries and clamours: many reports being brought, and importing that all was loſt and vtterly deſolate; that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> hauing obtained the poſſeſſion of infinite places, did dayly purſue his conqueſts with his accuſtomed fierceneſſe and crueltie. That long ſince both the one and the other <hi>Dibria</hi> had willingly rendred them ſelues to his deuotion, killing with their proper hands the Turkiſh garriſons, or deliuering them bound and fettered to their new Lord and maiſter. Theſe marches both of the neather and vpper <hi>Dibria</hi> did of old appertaine to <hi>Iohn Caſtriot:</hi> but he (as hath bene ſayd) being oppreſſed by <hi>Amurath,</hi> and by meanes of the peace which he demanded, had giuen him his owne children in hoſtage, and had reſigned vnto him both thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, which he quitted vnto him vpon ſome other conditions. Now theſe curriers comming (as is ſaid) to the court of <hi>Amurath,</hi> declared, that by meanes of the reuolt of the <hi>Dibrians,</hi> the Chriſtians would ſoone and eaſily come to be maſters of <hi>Sfetigrade:</hi> the which being ſeated in the vpper <hi>Dibria,</hi> where all was at their deuotion, did not

Vpon<note place="margin">Amurath leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an army againſt Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg.</note> this occaſion hauing with great diligence aſſembled his Counſell, &amp; the matter fully concluded on, he commanded a puiſſant armie to be leuied: by the which without the aduenture or loſſe of any thing, he thought vtterly to aboliſh and extinguiſh the name of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> and to take vengeance of the reuolt of the <hi>Albanois,</hi> and of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny iniuries which he had offred him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſtriot</hi> in like maner being certified of <hi>Amurath</hi> his reſolution, not onely by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons vnknowne and ſtrangers vnto him (as in ſuch changes there do neuer want men of that ſort) but by ſome alſo who were his friends, of whom he had as yet good ſtore about <hi>Amurath,</hi> made and procured long before, and whom the change of fortune had no whit altered or changed. He (I ſay) as he had ſhewed himſelfe of an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable audacitie and confidence in expoſing himſelfe to all perils: ſo did he euen in the middeſt of them vſe ſingular prudence, ſage aduiſe, and counſell. For conſidering the greatneſſe and importance of his conceipts, and the weightie burthen which he had taken vpon his ſhoulders, and hauing ſome doubt and miſtruſt in him ſelfe, that he ſhould not be of ſufficient abilitie to ſuſtaine and beare it out for ſo long a time, nor yet be able to renew his forces ſo often as the greatneſſe of thoſe warres would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>require: which he foreſaw (as a true Prophet) euen within the entrailes of <hi>Epire,</hi> and whereof he did but attend the comming euerie houre; he determined therefore to<note place="margin">Confederacy of Caſtriot purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with his neighbours, for the reſiſting of the Turkes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſions.</note> ſeeke out ſome ſtrange and forreine ſuccours, by meanes wherof he might more ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly order his owne affaires, and by the ayde of many might be the better able to repell and keepe off the force and violence of the tempeſt that did ſo threaten him. Firſt of all therefore he reſolued to enter into confederacie, and into ſome ſtrict and perpetuall kind of alliance with the Princes and great Lords his neighbours, both <hi>Albanois</hi> and * <hi>Illyrians.</hi> A thing indeed verie difficult to be effected, for that commonly men are<note place="margin">Theſe are the Sclauonians.</note> naturally more prone and apt to diſſention and diſcord, then to amity and concord. Yet did this fall out vnto him very facile and eaſie, as both the iſſue and the diſcourſe of the matter will make it manifeſt.</p>
            <p>But for that this treaty could not commodiouſly be handled with euery one in particular, neither by letters, nor meſſengers, nor by him ſelfe in perſon: it was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought beſt, that a Diet and generall aſſembly of all of them ſhould be aſsigned and appointed in ſome place within the circuite of <hi>Albany;</hi> to the intent, that both the preſence of the parties meeting together, and their voices and opinions being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and made knowen in common amongſt them all, it might be the better know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by the aduiſe of the whole counſell, what courſe was moſt meete and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to be taken. In the choiſe of the place alſo he vſed no leſſe prudence and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie: for none of all thoſe Princes were ſummoned to repaire to <hi>Croie,</hi> for feare leaſt it ſhould be thought he would ſtand too much vppon his greatneſſe, and would arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate to him ſelfe the preheminence in their aſſembly: as alſo to auoide all occaſion of miſtruſt: neither did he conuite them to <hi>Apollonia, Diana, Zabiach,</hi> or any other towne appertaining to the name of <hi>Albanie:</hi> to the intent he might take from them all matter of enuy, backwardneſſe, or delay, which might haue growen if they had bene drawn againſt their willes out of their own territories: or elſe for feare that they
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:13368:30"/>
ſhould diſdaine to repaire to any place belonging to a ſtraunger: becauſe it might be they eſteemed their owne townes of as much if not of more worthineſſe then thoſe of <q>others. As there is a kinde of people, who doe preferre and prize anie thing of their owne, farre before the like of other mens. But there was the towne* <hi>Liſſa</hi> (we ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily call it <hi>Aleſsia</hi>) diſtant ſomewhat more then two and twentie miles from <hi>Croy,</hi>

            <p>Thus were meſſengers diſpatched on all parts to call them together, and to ſignifie<note place="margin">A generall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly ſummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of all the princes and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of Epire.</note> vnto them the dayes &amp; the place wherein they ſhould aſſemble. Of thoſe which were aſſigned, there was not any one that was vnwilling or negligent in comming: not one of them made any excuſes or delayes, neither was there any buſineſſe (as it happened) either publike or particular which cauſed any of them to faile or to ſtay away: but all of them haſtened thither with exceeding readie and verie willing mindes. This was an euident teſtimonie what maner of men they would ſhewe them ſelues in time to come in other the accidents and occurrences of warre.

and beleeuing hath without doubt ruinated &amp; deſtroyed all of them: in ſuch ſort that on the tyrants part, they haue nothing at all left them, but the repentance of their ſimplicitie and ouerſight.

Go to now: let anie man here tell me, whether <hi>Ottoman</hi> did euer by his proweſſe atchieue anie great conqueſts, and whether the innumerable prouinces and infinite realmes which in our time he hath gotten and purchaſed, haue bene annexed vnto his crowne by force of his armes and puiſſance: let them account and recken vp the number of thoſe his triumphes and victories. Shall <hi>Epire</hi> then, being ſo inuincible, ſo flouriſhing in armes, ſo repleniſhed with Princes, with valiant Captaines, with ſo many warlike and ſtout peoples, ſo vnited and agreeing within themſelues; ſhall <hi>Epire</hi> I ſay, onely through this our credulitie be made the ſubiect of his outrage? How greatly the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian doth eſtimate and redoubt your vertue, I my ſelfe can giue you moſt certaine and aſſured teſtimonie: euen I, who haue liued with him many yeares both in warre and in peace. They would not euen now enterpriſe nor vndertake the warre againſt you, but that verie neceſſitie doth conſtraine them to it. Now what good or great matter can be effected or executed by a courage that is forced &amp; violently drawne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, any braue and reſolute ſouldier will ſoone tell vs. But howſoeuer this affection and matter of ſo iuſt griefe, do carie me away in ſpeaking vnto you, yet I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, but that there be many who hauing bene now of a long time accuſtomed to a peace (though ſmally honorable) will be highly aggrieued and diſcontented when they ſhall ſee themſelues inuited by me to participate with the miſeries and miſchiefes of warre: and they will not ſticke to ſay; That whatſoeuer be the fortune and ſucceſſe of our armes, yet nothing can be done without the expence and loſſe of their bloud. In like caſe me thinkes I ſee how the mothers will be diſcomforted, when they ſhall ſee their children ſent to the daungers and hazardes of the warres: the wiues will be heard to lament with great griefe and ſorrow, for the care which they haue of their husbands ſafetie: and the verie infants left at home in their houſes, will ſeeme to crie, for feare they ſhould be made orphanes: all men generally will call me cruell, and will deteſt me (which I can not thinke without horror) as a new authour of warres, of perils, and of bloudſhed and murther: whereas they ought rather (be it ſpoken without vaunting) to name me the Occaſioner and preſeruer of their libertie. But neither am I ſo careleſſe of the publique and common good, nor ſo carefull of mine owne priuate profite and intereſt, that I can endure to heare ſo manie complaints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amongſt you, nor to ſee ſo many miſchiefes light vpon you all in common: but that if this my counſell (moſt worthie Princes and Lordes) ſeeme not good and to your liking: or if this occaſion of entring into armes be not found profitable for the weale publique: or be not held honourable by all of you, I will be readie and willing to yeeld vp vnto <hi>Amurath</hi> (if you thinke it good) both <hi>Croye,</hi> and all the reliques of this vnfortunate Realme and Kingdome, deſiring much rather with the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular daunger of mine owne life, to prouide for your ſuretie, then to raigne with the publique detriment and dammage of all of you. One thing onely there is, the griefe whereof doeth greatly preſſe me: and that is, the miſerable condition of my people, and the innocent bloud of my cittizens, whome my heart can not ſuffer
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:13368:33"/>

(giue me leaue my lords to ſpeake freely vnto you) Is there any reaſon that your fellow citizen and countrie man ſhould ſtill abide with the tirant, in the middeſt of ſo many dangers and euer dwell in ſo damned a religion, as a continuall fugitiue from his natiue countrie, rather then to ſpend the reſt of his life in <hi>Epire,</hi> in the place of his natiuitie, in the ſocietie of Chriſtians, and in the middeſt of you his owne countrie men? Or is it poſſible that I ſhould be in <hi>Epire,</hi> and there to ſee and endure hereafter, that the ſeate of my aunceſtors, the ſcepter of my father, our ſepulchers, our temples, &amp; eſpecially (if I may ſo ſpeake) that our Gods ſhould any longer remaine vnder the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie of the circumciſed miſcreants? alas, doth it ſeeme a ſmall thing to you, that I haue euen vntil this day ſeene their hands filled with the blood of my ſubiects: that I haue dwelt ſo long with a wicked and vnmercifull bloudſucker, and haue ſpent well neere all the beſt and moſt pleaſant ſeaſon of my age in manifeſt &amp; certaine danger of my life?

And if for all this, my calamitie doe not yet moue you, but that you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre an ignominious peace, before an honorable warre; I will haue recourſe to my owne Nation, to my owne people and citizens, being reſolued to ſubmit my ſelfe quietly to the hazard and aduenture which fortune ſhall ſend me: and with thoſe only who with ſo conſtant &amp; free harts haue vowed and conſecrated their owne liues for my ſafetie. But neither will you (moſt courteous Princes) as I thinke, forſake &amp; aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me: for to what end are all of you here aſſembled in ſuch deuotion, if it be not for the warre, ſeeing that you cannot ſerue your ſelues of me to any other vſe or purpoſe? You I ſay, will defend me, though it were euen againſt your wils: when you ſhall vnderſtand, that this land afflicted by <hi>Amurath,</hi> ſhall implore &amp; craue your aide and aſſiſtance, when you ſhall know that the enemie inſolent &amp; puffed vp with victorie, will ſubuert &amp; ouerthrow your Seigniories &amp; your libertie: &amp; with a bloudy throat, &amp; full of rage, &amp; with polluted and ſacrilegious hands, wil run &amp; make haſt furiouſly to ſucke &amp; ſwallow vp your bloud. But let me intreat you, not to ſtay and attend theſe extremities: doe not you make ſo long ſtay and tariance, till you ſee ſome comming (then perhaps it will be too late) to implore your ſuccours: but euen now rather, and preſently conioyning your forces with our forces, &amp; your armes, with our armes: let vs driue and compell the enemy ſpeedily to take the field, or let vs be the firſt to ruſh
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:13368:34"/>
vpon him, and to inuade his territories. Then if he ſhall once ſee vs vnited: ſure &amp; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that either he will change his thoughts: or if he do aduenture to march for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, he may well, to his coſt, looſe and come ſhort of his wretched and greedy deſire of victorie &amp; conqueſt. For doe you thinke, that I in the meane time with the troupes which you ſhall commit vnto me, will remaine ſhut vp and reſtrained within the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures of any walles, and that as one of a faint courage and degenerating from my anceſtors, I will hide my ſelfe in ſome corner? or that from ſome high place or tower amongſt children, I will take vp my ſtande to beholde the enemie ſpoyling of your fieldes, and ſuffer the deſtruction of your landes and liuings and ſuch like calamities? No be you aſſured, that ſuch cowardize ſhall neuer come within my heart: the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie ſhall ſee me daily &amp; continually euen in his face with my enſignes, with my ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, to trie the fortune of his aſſaies and attempts; not in plaine battell &amp; open fight: but (God aiding me) by ſome other better kind of pollicie, and it may be, with verie litle and ſmall loſſe of my men, I ſhall make the deſſeignes and audacitie of <hi>Amurath</hi> to turne to ſmoake and to vaniſh away to nothing: and that from hencefoorth he ſhall haue enough to do, and be conſtrained to giue ouer his quarrell, and to leaue his bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage vnto you for a prey and bootie; at leaſtwiſe if he loue not to ſee his campe (after long continuance in his enemies countrie, in the fields of ſtrangers, and in the midſt of many diſcommodities) to be brought to that paſſe, as it ſhalbe rather in eſtate of an armie forced and beſieged, then of a beſieger &amp; one that forceth others. Vp then (no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and moſt Catholique Princes) let vs ſet aſide all delaies, let vs viſite the Prouince, let vs ſet downe good lawes &amp; orders of diſcipline, let vs leauie and muſter our ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and let vs lead on our forces, that when the infidels come in ſight, and the ſound of the trumpets doe call the ſouldiers to the battell, we be not then vnprouided, and to ſeeke for counſell, when there will be no time for it. Let vs make ſhewe vnto the poſteritie, and let vs make it knowen vnto all ages to come hereafter, that we are men worthie of a Chriſtian Empire.</q>

            <p>The oration of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> being ended, all the great perſonages in the aſſemblie did generally addreſſe themſelues vnto him, as the authour of their freedome and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation: and all with one accord approuing his ſpeech, with infinite praiſes &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations did exalt &amp; extoll him euen to the heauens. For this cauſe there was not any, who did not willingly commit vnto him al the charge &amp; weight, and al the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct &amp; managing of this warre, chooſing him alone as chiefe and ſuperiour. Euerie<note place="margin">Scanderbeg choſen generall of the warres againſt the Turkes by the Princes of Epyre.</note> one did conſigne vnto him his ſubiects and his armes, teſtifying thereby &amp; by his high clamours, that to him only was due the honor of this ſouereigntie; the only name of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as of another <hi>Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der,</hi> was able to defend that litle angle &amp; corner of <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> againſt all the aſſaults of the enemie. And more then that, the perfection of his skill &amp; ſcience in armes &amp; the art military: his maruellous prudence &amp; counſel euen befitt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing &amp; worthy an Emperor: his long experience practiſed in the manners &amp; cuſtomes of the barbarians: his diuine iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t confirmed by daily vſe &amp; long experience, did enflame the harts of them all with a certaine and aſſured hope of victory. But after ſo many goodly offers made vnto him, the principall and chiefeſt was this, which <hi>Ary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amnites</hi> in the preſence of the whole aſſembly, did preſent vnto him, for he after he had raiſed himſelfe out of his ſeate, and with a good grace and eloquent oration had exalted the rule and gouernement of <hi>Iohn</hi> the father of <hi>Caſtriot,</hi> the counſels and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations of the ſonne, and the happie beginnings of his vertue and good fortune, then frankely and freely did he offer vnto him a yearely tribute: which he preſented vnto him in this or the like language.</p>
            <p>That which <hi>Amurath</hi> did exact and take of me euen till this day, during the time
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:13368:34"/>
that I preferred an ignominious peace before a deadly and fatall warre: and whileſt I<q>
                  <note place="margin">Oration of Aryamnit offering him ſelfe tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie to Scanderbeg.</note> did loue a ſhamefull libertie, better then the warres accompanying and occaſioning my misfortunes: the ſame doe thou receiue moſt valiant Prince by the conſent both of God and man; receiue (I ſay) the gage and pledge of a good heart, if not ſo great and magnificent, yet at leaſtwiſe not ingrate and vnthankefull. I adiudge it and giue it thee freely, for the libertie of <hi>Albanie</hi> and mine owne, for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of our eſtate, of our crowne, our people and our children: praying thee that from hencefoorth, thou wouldeſt vſe in common with me, my men and my forces, and if there be any other thing which either my fortune or my vertue ſufficiently tried and knowen, haue reſerued vnto me from the handes of ſuch an enemie. And this which I doe preſent vnto thee moſt redoubted Prince of the <hi>Albanois</hi> (for let<note place="margin">viz. Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath.

            </p>
            <p>Immediatly vpon this act, many others moued by a certaine iealouzie, did of their<note place="margin">Princes of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre ioyne in league to aide Scanderbeg.</note> owne motion ſeſſe and taxe themſelues, becomming tributaries vnto him, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the qualitie of their power and abilitie. <hi>Andrewe</hi> and <hi>Tanuſee</hi> his Nephew were inferiour to none of them in liberalitie. And by this meanes a great ſumme of money was gathered at that inſtant for to defray the charges of the warre. And it may be (as the report ranne in thoſe partes, that the reuenue of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount<note place="margin">Reuenewes of Scanderbeg more then 200000. crownes by the yeare.</note> to more then two hundreth thouſande crownes by the yeare. But be it that that which he poſſeſſed within the Prouince, was of a more large compaſſe and circuit then any other Prince, yet it can not be gaineſaide, but that hee was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeable and burthenſome to his ſubiects in exacting vpon them alone this huge ſumme, eſpecially in a time of warre kindled on all partes without ceaſing, and the inhabitants (as a man may ſay) with one hande holding the plough, and with the other the ſworde.

Nicholas de la Pierre,</hi> on the other ſide. The which countrie is verie famous or rather infamous by reaſon of a notable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſter and great miſhappe that befell the Romaine Senate, who were once there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, at ſuch time as <hi>Caeſar</hi> being Dictator, did take armes againſt <hi>Pompey,</hi> and his owne natiue countrey. But to our purpoſe: The reſidue of the companie who were not of power and abilitie to furniſhe him with taxes and ſubſidies, did promiſe him the imployment of their perſons liberally and freely, and their continuall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and trauell. The Venetians, becauſe they woulde not derogate anie thing from the maieſtie of their greatneſſe, would not taxe them ſelues, nor bee tyed with the reſidue to the aduauncing out of anie certaine and ordinarie contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but they promiſed to be readie at all times to ayde and helpe them with victualles, and anie other kinde of ſuccours. Nowe after that this worthie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage had beene made thus beholding vnto them by an infinite number of prayſes and officious courteſies (according as all of them did ſtriue therein, either more or leſſe to ſurmount each other) and after ſolemne and publique prayers and proceſſions generally made for the better ſtrengthening and fortifying of the league: ſome of the companie did accompanie him to <hi>Croie,</hi> and the reſt retyred themſelues to their owne homes. The firſt that was appointed to come thither<note place="margin">Sfetygrade yeelded to Moſes.</note> was <hi>Moſes,</hi> who (hauing ſo ſtreightened and neere preſſed <hi>Sfetigrade,</hi> that it was rendered vnto him by compoſition) had beene called backe with his troupes
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:13368:35"/>
from the frontiers, excepting a few, who were left there vpon certaine mountaines to keepe good watch: beſides thoſe whom he had put in garriſon within the towne. Theſe bandes did not exceede the number of fiue thouſand men, for that <hi>Caſtriot</hi> at his comming from thence to the former aſſembly, had licenſed many of them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part; by meanes whereof without any delay commiſſions were made and diſpatched and many great men ſent abroad to leauy ſouldiers on all parts.</p>
            <p>Whileſt theſe things were thus a doing within <hi>Epyre,</hi> you may not thinke that the braynes of <hi>Amurath</hi> alſo were vnbuſied, or that he did forget anything tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſubiect of this warre which hee had enterpriſed with ſuch hatred and fierceneſſe of courage. He had nowe raiſed an armie of fortie thouſande horſe,<note place="margin">Haly Baſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with an armie of 40000. againſt Scanderbeg.</note> all men of choiſe: and he had committed them to <hi>Haly Baſſa</hi> one of his leaders, a man as valiant of his perſon, as in matters of aduiſe and counſell well tryed and approued: and who for his ſufficiencie had attayned manie high degrees and great charges of honour in the warres: in ſo much that the brauerie of the troupes, and the reputation of the Chieftaine, did giue them an eaſie hope and good aſſurance of a happie and fortunate ſucceſſe. There was no other talke to be heard amongſt the Turkes, but of this armie and of the warre of <hi>Epyre:</hi> and ſuch was the opinion and conceite of all in generall of this iourney, that whoſoeuer had heard them, would haue iudged, that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> had beene alreadie taken priſoner: and that hee had beene euen nowe going to ſuffer puniſhment and execution. So doe wee ſee ſometimes in the ſiege of a towne, that the aſſaylantes before it be taken, doe thinke to haue the victorie without bloud: and they doe often fall to contention amongſt themſelues about the parting and deuiding of the ſpoile and bootie. For it is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie vſuall and accuſtomed in the ſpirites of mortall men, to reckon without their hoaſt, and to promiſe themſelues great matters without paine or difficultie. For this cauſe euen in <hi>Epyre</hi> there was nowe nothing but diſorder and confuſion by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the troubles which ſeemed to approch: for the brute of the comming of the Baſſa made all things ſeeme greater and more fearefull, then they were in truth and in deede. A man might haue ſeene on all ſides thoſe that dwelt in the fields, haſting<note place="margin">A notable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the tumult and confuſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt the common people where an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaſion is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</note> to ſaue themſelues in the townes, and driuing their cattell before them: the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes fortifying their walles, and appointing gardes for their portes, as if the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie had beene alreadie diſcouered: the olde men quaking and trembling would put the young men in minde of their countrie, their wiues, their children, and of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God and their religion eſpecially: they would cry vpon them to be of good courage and hardie, and they would neuer ceaſe to inflame &amp; animate them that they might the better doe their deuoire and dutie. Neither was the weake and tender ſexe of women free from this publique feare and terror, but that it did embolden them to runne out into the ſtreetes amongſt their armed husbands: ſometimes ſtirring them vppe to vertue and manhood, by their iuſt and pitifull lamentations: and ſometimes in extreame care running to the temples and holy places, and making their vowes, prayers, and orizons vnto God before the altars, for the preſeruation of their countrie. And the litle children alſo aſtoniſhed with their mothers teares, would crie out more and more with all extremitie.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> none of theſe newes, neither of the arriuall of <hi>Haly,</hi> nor of the enemies armie, nor the aſtoniſhment of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people, did any thing at all moue him: but he made a mocke of the vaine attempts of <hi>Amurath,</hi> &amp; of the fooliſh feare of the <hi>Albanoys.</hi> Hauing therfore aforehand ordered all things throughout the prouince for feare leaſt too great licenſe &amp; neglect of the enemy ſhould abate the courage of his ſouldiers, &amp; diuert them from the care &amp; regard of the war, he did ſo deale &amp; perſuade
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:13368:35"/>
with them, that he enflamed their harts with ſo generall a confidence, &amp; did put them in ſo good a hope of victory, that they were neuer ſeene to deſire any thing more then the comming of the Turkiſh generall, ech of them hauing a kind of enuie and deſire to make proofe of their deuoire and valure: and by the generall and particular deſert of them all to leaue vnto their Prince a large and ample teſtimonie of their loyaltie. In like manner in this one thing did <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> alſo ſhewe a notable example of his<note place="margin">Courage and reſolute aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg.</note> maruellous courage and aſſurance, giuing all the world occaſion of wonder: yea and <hi>Haly Baſſa</hi> his enemie, if he had in any ſort conſidered of the fact, I doe not doubt, but it would haue made him greatly abaſhed. For whereas many fierce and warrelike peoples and nations did reſort vnto him in great abundance from all partes: ſo as he might well haue made, not one, but many great and mightie armies: he, after he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended &amp; magnified their good affection, would not admit any but the choiſeſt of them, and did retaine with himſelfe only eight thouſand horſe, and ſeuen thouſand foote. The ouerplus both of the old bands, and of the new encreaſe he licenſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part: of whom notwithſtanding he diſpoſed ſome in certaine places for diuerſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes and occurrences. Euery man wondered and was abaſhed at this deuiſe of the Prince ſo hardie and aduenturous: but my opinion is, that this his act proceeded of ſome doubt, leaſt if he ſhould haue had the diſgrace to be ouercome in ſet battell, he ſhould afterwards want the meanes to relieue himſelfe. And this was the occaſion (as I beleeue) that he did furniſh ſo many fortreſſes with forces and garriſons, as being willing to reſerue them for a ſupplement and remainder of defence in time to come, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the inconueniences of an ouerthrow, and by meanes wherof, he might by way of ſurpriſe, extort the victorie out of the hands of the enemie, beginning perhaps to waxe inſolent in their proſperitie. Notwithſtanding he was neuer heard to ſpeake of any ſuch matter, but he did continually and with a cheerefull countenance promiſe himſelfe an aſſured good fortune, and a ſucceſſe in all things anſwerable to his deſire, which maketh me to thinke and to affirme, that this only was not the reaſon, why he retayned at that time ſo ſmall forces. But I beleeue that it proceeded of a ſingular <q>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence which remained in him: a thing commonly ſeene, eſpecially in great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent<note place="margin">Confidence and fortune ſeldome faile great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent natures.</note> natures, who very ſeldom or neuer doe find themſelues abuſed or deceiued by fortune.</q> For this is to be marked, yea and to be admired in <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> that almoſt continually and with verie few and ſmall forces, he obtained againſt the infidels ſo many and often victories, as it is almoſt incredible. This is it, which hauing often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times rauiſhed and held me in ſuſpence, hath made me in this hiſtory to deliuer many aduentures to the poſteritie, the truth wherof had not yet ſunke into my owne mind and opinion. And yet (it may be) hereafter it will not be amiſſe nor inconuenient to beleeue them: becauſe it can not be denied, but that ſome ages doe bring foorth<q> ſtrange caſes and accidents, to the intent we ſhould haue ſome matter to maruell at. And that this is true, we may beholde a principall example of the like valure and good fortune: if we looke no further then euen in the ſame age, to <hi>Hunyades,</hi>
               </q> who<note place="margin">Hunyades the Deſpot of Tranſiluania was the father of Mathias Coruinus king of Hungarie.</note> ſo many times in a manner all alone, did foile and confounde the puiſſance of the Turkes, and with a ſmall number obtained more trophees of victorie, then manie others who haue bene much better accompanied, &amp; whoſe numbers haue exceeded. But why ſhould we ſtand any longer with ſuch curioſity vpon the truth and credit of this matter, ſeeing that (without ſingular impudencie) no man can denie theſe things being ſo freſh and late in memorie, and whereof it litle wanteth, but that our fathers might with their eies haue bene witneſſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> hauing now enrolled and taken a generall view and muſter of his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and publique vowes and prayers being offered vnto God by euery man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

to his owne fancie, departed from <hi>Croy</hi> and encamped neere to the lower <hi>Dibria,</hi> where euery day he heard newes that the enemy approched. Therupon he bethought himſelfe, that being newly made their Chieftaine and Captaine, he ought to vſe ſome ſpeech to his new ſouldiers: for which cauſe commaunding ſilence, Thus he began<note place="margin">Oration of Scanderbeg to his ſouldiers marching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the</note> to ſpeake vnto them.</p>
            <p>I would wiſh (my companions) that you had happened vpon me as your Captaine, <q>and that I might haue enioyed your notable &amp; faithfull ſeruice, when my affaires had bene in greater proſperity, and in a time wherin my reigne had bene more happy and fortunate. For nowe being aſhamed of the many bondes and obligations, whereby I ſee my ſelfe tyed vnto you, I would not haue inuited you to the diſcommodities of new warres, and to ſo many freſh miſchieues: but hauing bene ſo well receiued and entertained by my Citizens, I would then haue yeelded them (at my eaſe and leiſure and with patience) that due thankes and recompence which long before this time I had prepared my ſelfe to render vnto them: and as a Chieftaine that ſeeth his ſouldiers embrued and couered with blood, I would make no ſpare of my ſelfe in recompence of your labours, trauels and daungers, and for the blood of the enemy which you haue heretofore ſhed ſo valiantly. But ſeeing the deſtinies haue ſo ordained, and that it pleaſeth fortune that I muſt diſcouer vnto you my affaires, and that I muſt be an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion rather of your paines then of your tranquilitie and reſt: Conſider I pray you, that it ſtandeth vs vpon to endure it valiantly and patiently, and to ſubmit our ſelues to whatſoeuer difficulties this warre ſhall bring with it; to the intent that one day we may liue in peace and quiet. It behoueth vs, willingly and with francke and readie mindes to take armes, to breake the bondes of ſo long a ſeruitude and bondage, and the enemie being chaſed from our partes, afterwardes to reioice our ſelues in a more happie kinde of life, and in a perdurable and laſting libertie, whereunto it is not needfull that I paine my ſelfe to animate and incenſe you: For that as all of you doe now ſhew your ſelues affectioned to take my part: ſo is it moſt certaine, that wordes (as the ſaying is) doe not increaſe hardineſſe in men that are couragions: ad hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that I canne ſay no more vnto you with my weapons in my hand then you being in armes ought to know of your owne ſelues. The enemy (whom you haue nowe neare you) will adueriſe you thereof ſufficiently: the indignitie of ſo many iniuries: the wrath and hatred which they haue conceiued doe admoniſh you of it, and doe arme you againſt them: the yoke of our bondage ſhaken off and broken: the libertie both of our bodies and of our ſoules: the mortall hatred of <hi>Amurath:</hi> the qualitie of the Barbarian: the cruell commandementes: the horrible executions wherewith he doth aduance himſelfe to ſucke vp our blood: and laſt of all the proces of the finall ruine and deſtruction of vs all being now paſt and fully concluded on: all theſe doe inuite you to take armes againſt him. If then our countrey (the loue whereof containeth all loue, and for which we ought to thinke, that we haue neuer ſhed ſufficient of our blood, if the particular vertue of euerie one of vs, if the honour and nobilitie of our kindred doe ſtrengthen the courage of anie man; let them animate you (my friendes) to betake you to armes and to ſharpen your launces. You haue by my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite and procurement, ſo ſpeedily and without the loſſe of one drop of blood, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered <hi>Croie</hi> the ſeate of your forefathers: Spare not now in defence thereof to ſhed your bloud if neede be. This is the daye, wherein both hope and oportunitie doe preſent themſelues vnto you, for the recouerie of your countrey ſo long time loſt: and for the rayſing of you to great and high fortune, you haue choſen me either for your companion or your Captaine before any other, and I wil not be the laſt in any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, in any hazards whatſoeuer: and if peraduenture in other things my forwardnes
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:13368:36"/>
ſhal not be ſeconded with as good fortune: yet will I neuertheleſſe make known vnto you the conditions, the conceites, the wiles and policies of the enemy: with whom (it may be by the diuine ordinance) I haue ſpent the moſt part of my yeares to my owne hindrance, and haue bene inſtructed in them to the end they might ſerue to ayde you at this preſent. It would be vnpleaſing vnto me heere to report vnto you their baſe and vile condition, but that hope (which maketh promiſe of a victorie leſſe paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) doth render the ſouldier more reſolute and deliberate. What other thing are they but the dregs and ſcum of ſlaues and raskals gathered together, more accuſtomed to theftes and robberies, then to a true warre and a iuſt kinde of fight and combat? Is it certaine that this ſort of men, whoſe name is ſo famous amongſt perſons feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and timerous, ſhould be thoſe Turkes, the ſlaues and fugitiues of the <hi>Scythians?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Originall of the Turkes.</note> whoſe fathers (as ſome ſay) had their dwellings beyonde the Ryphean mountaines, and the Iſles of <hi>Tarracont</hi> euen in the heart and boſome of the North, and in the Northerne Ocean?

follow with a troupe of horſe, and to couer themſelues vnder their ſides:</q> by meanes whereof they might be the better able both to ſafe gard themſelues from the enemie, and to endammage the Barbarians the more grieuouſly, who miſtruſted no ſuch kind of matter in their ordering: betweene the one and the other of theſe troupes ſtoode <hi>George Streſe,</hi> a Knight moſt hardie and couragious, accompanied with the ſouldiers<note place="margin">George Stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe.</note> and all the youth of <hi>Croy</hi> round about him, hauing ſo diſpoſed of them purpoſely, that he might be both the beholder and encourager of his citizens. After the ſquadron of archers followed the maine bodie of the infanterie: namely, the bands of pikes and targatyers, conducted by <hi>Aidyn</hi> the brother of <hi>Gnee Muſachee. Vranocontes</hi> a ſage and<note place="margin">Aidin. Vranocontes.</note> expert warrior with the reſt of the horſemen, led the rereward and the ſupplies. This was a ſtrong and cloſe batallion, compounded of the flower of the olde ſouldiers, and beſt men: holding themſelues firme like a bulwarke for the rallay &amp; retraite of the other troupes, before that they ſhould be broken or forced to recule: (the Romaines named it <hi>Triarij.</hi>) The troupes of footmen that marched with him, were commanded and had in charge; that aſſoon as they ſhould ſee their fellowes to breake forth in the am buſcado, and the enemie charged behind, and entangled betweene the two points or wings of the armie, they ſhould ſuddenly ſpread themſelues, and opening their rancks, ſhould giue way vnto the men at armes: and that then with a new terror, they ſhould diſorder the enemie, and with one and the ſame charge ſtrike in vpon them being alreadie wearied and ſore trauelled: and that then the ſaid footmen cloſing and ioyning themſelues againe in troupe in their owne places, ſhould together with the ſupplies ſtand faſt, and keepe the batallions from being broken or endammaged, till ſuch time as they might ſee manifeſt and apparant likelihood of victorie, and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie in full diſaray and diſorder. In this manner had <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> martialled his troups, and cauſed them to holde cloſe without ſuffering the trumpet to giue the ſignall of fight, till he ſawe the Baſſa alſo arranged in order of battell, and aduancing forward. For he feared leaſt that the ſouldiers disbanding themſelues through ouermuch haſte and raſhneſſe to the encounter: and breaking their orders by reaſon of their too great furie and deſire to aduance themſelues, ſhould bring the eſtate of the whole armie to ſome encombrance.</p>
            <p>The Generall of the Turkes conſidering the order of our battelles, aduanced for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, and by way of mockery often repeated theſe wordes: Euer, euer (quoth he) doe the greater deuour the leſſer, and with open throate he laughed both to ſee them<note place="margin">The battell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg and Haly Baſſa.</note> ſo raunged, and at the fooliſh pompe of the Chriſtian: marching ſo formally (as he thought) to his owne funerals. One of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> legions was come forward with great hardineſſe before the others, but being charged ſpeedily and neerely by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne hope of the Chriſtians, they gaue backe and forſooke their place as ſuddenly, before that the two armies had affronted ech other: and at the verie firſt beginning, they ſuffered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be beaten backe euen within their trenches, retyring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues faſter then a good pace. But the Prince of <hi>Albanie</hi> miſdoubting ſome Turkiſh ſtratageme, ſent forth part of his horſemen both to ſtay the furious purſuit of his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and to bring euery man into his place. The like hapened in the left wing, and therefore both the one and the other being retyred to their troupes, they prepared themſelues againe to the future conflict, and to come vnto a full battell with both the armies. Now were the <hi>Mahometiſts</hi> the more encouraged, for that a few of theirs in a mockerie (as it were) had deceiued many of the Chriſtians: wherefore when the maine fight beganne, <hi>Tanuſe</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> parting betwene them the two wings of the enemie, went fiercely to the encounter. And <hi>Caſtriot</hi> with the like furie pricking forward cheerefully with his horſe, did aſſaile the Batallion of the enemie that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:13368:37"/>
had made choiſe of. At one and the ſame time alſo was the ambuſhment ready to breake forth of the wood with moſt high and loud cries and clamours, before that the enemie with all his forces had giuen in vppon our ſquadrons, and before that all were come equally to the medley. Manie companies of the Turkes perceiuing this, (eſpecially thoſe of the rereward,) &amp; being poſſeſſed with a ſudden feare, leauing both the campe and the charge, betooke themſelues to flight: ſo that they in the vowarde being ſurpriſed and incloſed by the two wings of the Chriſtians, did ſee themſelues ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the butcherie and ſlaughter of the middle legion. There was but one batal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion onely of the enemie which <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> was not able to breake, nor durſt to ſet v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, ſo well was the ſame defended and reenforced by the Barbarians, who had made it of their greateſt number of their people as a ſure and ſafe rampier for the ſafetie of the whole armie. There (as it was ſoone after knowen) did the Baſſa <hi>Haly,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enuironned with the ſtouteſt and ſtrongeſt forces of all his armie, maintaine the euent and hazard of the battell for a verie long time, wauering and vncertaine. In this meane while <hi>Aydin</hi> hauing charged vpon the middle warde of the Turkiſh ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and preſſing hard vppon thoſe legions, had filled all with murther and bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhedde: and the tumult was there more bloudie and deſperate, then in anie other part of the fight. For the enemie ſeeing that there was no meanes of faſetie left him, but onely by armes, with the greateſt furie that might be, forced in vppon our men with their ſwordes in point, to the intent they might not die vnreuenged. And after the hazarde and vnfortunate errour of warre had brought ſome of them thither to the encounter: there came others ſtill running to their ſuccours, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by the acceſſe of their forces to haue relieued their companions; in ſuch ſorte that the more the Turkes made head thitherwardes, and the thicker that they reſorted to the encounter: ſo much the longer and doubtfull would the reſiſtance haue beene, if <hi>Vranocontes</hi> freſh and luſtie both of courage and of forces, diſmarch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſame inſtant, and falling in pell mell amongeſt them, as they were now wearied and wauering had not ended the battell, and ouerthrowen thoſe that remayned. That which moued the Chriſtian Chiefetaine to be of this minde: that his hoaſt ſhould inuade the Infidels ſo late, and not to come to the ayde of his men before they were in ſo harde an eſtate, was this; for that he ſawe both the two winges, and the Cornet and garde it ſelfe of the Prince on all ſides beſet and buſied: and hauing their handes full at the beginning, he would not that they ſhould remaine altogether vnfurniſhed and deſtitute of ſupplyes and ſuccours. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he deferred the employment of his horſemen, and made choice of this time and occaſion as moſt fitte and proper to weaken their forces, and to giue them the checke and ouerthrowe. Hence it grewe that not anie one of them almoſt did eſcape awaye in ſafetie, but that they paſſed vnder the ſworde of the Chriſtians, excepting onely three hundreth vppon whom, lifting vppe their handes for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: and caſting awaie their weapons as people wearied and ſpent with woundes, <hi>Castriot</hi> would not permit the extreame rigour of victorie to be vſed. By occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion whereof the troupes of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> after this their goodly exploite and mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie trauell accompliſhed and ended, came with exceeding great reioycing and<note place="margin">Victorie of Scanderbeg of Haly Baſſa &amp; the Turkes.</note> acclamations to the preſence of their Generall, where they founde all things as they wiſhed and deſired. For the <hi>Croyans</hi> had wholy broken the battallion of the Baſſa, and after a wonderfull ſlaughter did purſue the Turkiſh Generall, who ſaued himſelfe with the loſſe of his horſe. There was nothing ſeene nor heard on any ſide but bloud &amp; maſſacres with cryes and lamentations of men drawing to their end: Some tooke priſoners, others leauing behind them the trunkes of the dead bodies deformed, did
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:13368:38"/>
cut off the heades to make preſents of them to their Generall: manie of them alſo fell to rifling of the baggage: according as the minds of ſome men are to be egerly ſet on their gaine and profit. Finally throughout all the campe there was mention made of this victorie ſo memorable and almoſt incredible, euen to them eſpecially who were ouercome and vanquiſhed: euerie man being abaſhed at the maruellous execution in ſo ſhort a time: for the fight continued from the ſunne riſing but till the third houre. In this battell beſides foure and twentie enſignes taken, and 2000 Turkes priſoners, there were ſlaine vpon the place two and twentie thouſand. Of the Chriſtians there<note place="margin">Number of Turkes 22000 ſlaine.</note> died verie few; and it is ſaid that there were not miſſing of them but about one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth and twentie: but of ſuch as were wounded there were a farre greater number. In this manner then did our men that day obtaine that notable victorie vpon the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creantes according to the expectation and hope of them all in generall: withall that in this hard encounter, nothing was forgotten which might not onely inuite, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo compell fortune to fauour them in the euent and iſſue of the battell. There was no oportunitie, place, nor good order, nor any notable reaſon which might be eſteemed iuſt and neceſſarie to drawe a man to the hazard of battell, but it was carefully and diligently obſerued. If we ſhould ſpeake of the Captaines and the ſouldiers; I dare well affirme, that in this iourney Lyons had Lyons for their leaders and conducters. A great number of them were olde ſouldiers, who had before times borne armes euen vnder the father of <hi>Scanderbeg:</hi> ſo as you would not haue taken them for ſouldiers, but for maſters and teachers in the arte militarie. In this ſort did they thinke nowe to haue made an end of this warre by meanes of the winning of this battell: and that once they ſhould haue abated the bragges and audacitie of the Turkes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> being nowe maſter of the fielde, held himſelfe quiet within his campe, the reſidue of that day, and all the night following. The next morning (his courage as yet boyling through the good hap of this encounter) he buſied himſelfe in taking or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for that which remained, and eſpecially to animate the ſouldiers to an enterpriſe verie conuenient and needefull, and which ſhould be no leſſe delightfull to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: to witte, the ouerrunning, and ſacking of the enemies countrey. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Oration of Scanderbeg to his ſouldiers, inuiting them to ſpoile the Turkiſh terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torier.</note> he vſed theſe or the like wordes vnto them.</p>
            <p>Hitherto (my ſouldiers) haue you foughten for me your prince, euen till this day, and till nowe haue you ſhewed and done your deuoire for your countrey: from henceforward your owne profeſſion doth inuite you, and your owne good fortune doth ſummon you to continue as you haue begunne. Behold how on all partes the <q>legions of the enemie are by your vertue ouerthrowen and diſcomfited: and nowe may you number and recount your owne prowes and valiant deedes. It may be that ſecretly in your thoughtes, you promiſe to yourſelues from me ſome great rewards, and ſome ſingular recompence, which ſhould be prepared and prouided for you, for ſo many labours: for ſo much blood: for ſo many trauels ſuffered in this battell: and I proteſt vnto you on my faith, your expectation ſhall not be fruſtrate, ſo farre forth as I ſhall find the meanes and poſſibilitie. I do verie well and ſufficiently conceiue in my minde the commendations and praiſes of you all both in generall and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. This onely is the reward that you ſhall expect of me (let me make my ſelfe a litle merrie with you) if ſo be the courages of ſouldiers canne content themſelues with praiſes onely. Other goods haue I not at this time, wherewith I may honour your valure: but hereafter when I ſhall haue things in abundance to diſpoſe of, aſſure your ſelues I will depart with them vnto you as bountifully. What is there that you can receiue more pleaſing and with a better courage? according to other mens iudgement and opinion, then this honor &amp; glory, which ech of you ſhall carie home in triumph
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:13368:38"/>
as a conqueſt atchieued by his owne arme and proper vertue? Beholde here neare at hand the territorie of the enemy, rich and plentifull in wealth of all ſorts: your gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantiſe and proweſſe hath diſfurniſhed them, and made them bare and naked of all defence: now therefore with good leyſure and eaſe doe you charge and loade your ſelues with the prey and ſpoyle thereof, which is left and abandoned to your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and diſcretion. Let the feare of the enemy farre and wide know you to be the Conquerours; euen you (I ſay) whom our natiue countrey ſhall preſently ſee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourning home chearefull, ioyous, and triumphant. This will be no ſmall encreaſe of benefite vnto you, to come from a peece of ſeruice ſo excellent. Neuertheleſſe, to the intent it may be ſayed, that I alſo in ſome ſort haue rewarded you for this dayes victory, and that the one of you haue no occaſion to enuy the other, ſeeing that the vertue of you all in the fight was alike and equall; I doe here ordaine and appoint, that the footemen ſhall take the horſes of their ſlaine enemies, and that all of you from henceforth ſhall ſerue on horſebacke as men at Armes. Now therefore (vnder the fauour of the great God) let euery man follow me chearefully, that we maie goe on and reape the moſt acceptable and gladſome fruites of your perfect and full deuoyre.</q>

            <p>The ſouldiours who had liſtened all this while verie attentiuelie to his ſpeaches,<note place="margin">Spoile and ſack of the enemies countrey, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Sca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg to his ſouldiors.</note> with verie great ſignification of ioy and gladneſſe (as men ouerioyed with hope of the prey and booty, which they did expect by ſpoyling of their enemies countrey) did approue this his encouragement. They ran therefore euery where, here and there without diſcretion, without order, without conduct, being ſtirred and pricked on with an aſſured and ſodaine contempt and negligence, proceeding (as it ſeemeth) of their happy and good ſucceſſe. But the Prince being well aduiſed, and not hauing any affiaunce in the inconſtant and fickle fauours of Fortune, he ſtayed the fury and violence of his ſouldiours, till ſuch time as thoſe which hee had ſent to make a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery, did bring him backe word that there was no daunger. And then (the ſacke and pillage being permitted them freely) the men at armes altogether puffed vppe with the late victory which they had gotten, and diſperſed here and there in diuerſe places, did caſt them ſelues in vppon the enemies country, and caried away the goods of the husbandmen, their perſons, and their cattell. Neither did their furie ſpare to ſhew it ſelfe vppon the verie trees. Nothing was pardonned of what kinde ſoeuer, whereunto the fire and the ſword might doe any dammage and diſpleaſure, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting onely women and children. The booty was gathered and drawen together, and driuen with ſuch confuſion, noiſe and debate, that a man woulde haue iudged, there had bene begun ſome new tumult of warres, and that the fieldes had bene full of men fighing and combatting. Their woundes did not withhold or hinder anie one of them (for the greedie deſire of pillage had drawen thither many of thoſe who were wounded in the battell) but their paines and trauels ſo lately taken, were quite forgotten, and (as it were) cleane vaniſhed away. Neither the labours, nor the waightineſſe of their burthens, did not diſcourage any one of them, no more then the exceſſe and aboundance of ſpoyle (which commonly cauſeth wearineſſe and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiety) did ſatisfie and content them: in ſo much that the griefe and ſorrow of the ſouldiors was greater, for leauing that which they could not beare away, then their ioy and contentment of that which they caried with them. When they had thus continued long enough in ſpoyling and foraging, and that the rage of the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours was mitigated and appeaſed vppon the countrey of the enemy: <hi>Caſtriot</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſound the retraite, and his men being ouerloaden with the prey and bootie, marched awaie preſentlie with great gladneſſe and ioy. The Captaines made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:13368:39"/>
               <q>mery at the ſloth and lazineſſe of the ſouldiors: reproaching them that of braue and valiaunt warriours, they were now become ſheepeſtealers: and of defendours of the glory and renow me of <hi>Albanie,</hi> men might ſee them chaunged into the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite and trade of ſheepeheardes. And thus ſcoffing ſometimes at one, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at another, with many pleaſaunt ieſtes and wordes of mockerie, each after o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this or the like manner; what (ſayed they) woulde <hi>Halie</hi> Baſſa now ſaie with the reliques of his diſcomfiture, if hee were euen nowe in place and did ſee you in this point, dragging after you ſo vile and baſe baggage of neither worth nor valour, but a fitte reward for couetous and greedy ſouldiours? Would hee not bluſhe extreamely at ſo vile and ſhamefull Conquerours? And would hee not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach his men of their faintneſſe and cowardize, that hadde ſuffered them ſelues to be ſurmounted and ouercome by ſuch a ſort of baſe companions: and for that they hadde yeelded vnto ſuch men the honour and the glorie of the combate?</q> Thus did the ſouldiours full of mirth and merriment, with diuerſe ſportes and ſongs full of ioy and gladneſſe, caſe and mittigate the hard trauell of the way, till ſuch time as with high cries and clamours they ſaluted the guardes of their Campe which mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched on before them. The night following being paſt within their Campe: <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi> the next morning before daie breake, commaunded to truſſe vp the baggage, and with his hoaſt triumphaunt marched on directly towardes <hi>Croie.</hi> The multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ſcattered euery where throughout all the high waies and paſſages, did ſalute and call them both generally and priuately triumphant and valiaunt. Euery man admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the greatneſſe of the ſpoiles gotten from the enemy, and hardly were the new made men at armes diſcerned and knowen from the old. Theſe congratulations and reioycings did endure many daies, and there were ſent vnto all the Princes and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Lordes of <hi>Epire,</hi> letters crowned with lawrell and certaine ſtandards, and the reſidue were hanged vp in their churches.</p>
            <p>This yeare was famous and notable by reaſon of this victory: but much more<note place="margin">1443.</note> memorable was it afterwardes by the dolorous diſcomfiture of the Chriſtians at <hi>Varna.</hi> The which to paint it out vnto you more liuely, I muſt draw backe to the<note place="margin">Of the warres betweene the Turkes and the Hungarians.</note> defait of <hi>Carambey,</hi> whereof I entreated in the former booke. You knowe (if you haue any knowledge in the courſe and vſage of Armes) that one diſgrace of Fortune, and the gaine of one onely battell, doth euer bring much disfauour and many miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes to the looſer, and cauſeth freſh beginnings of new enterpriſes to his enemies. Euen ſo that rude Baſtanado giuen to <hi>Carambey</hi> at the battell of <hi>Moraua,</hi> and the reuolt of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> falling both at once vppon <hi>Amurath,</hi> did ſollicite and cauſe the * <hi>Caramanian</hi> to moue warre againſt him: ſo that preparing a puiſſant and mightie<note place="margin">This is the king of Cilicia.

But finding that he ſhould not be ſtrong enough, vnleſſe he did wholly and altogether oppoſe him ſelfe againſt this new e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy: beſides that the ſucceſſe of the forepaſſed ouerthrow at <hi>Moraua,</hi> did make him begin to bethinke him ſelfe, and to redoubt the felicity of the Chriſtians. Firſt of all therefore (as I haue told you) he would aſſure him ſelfe of the king of <hi>Hungarie</hi> by a peace: the which being concluded, and reſpectiuely ſworne vppon the holie Euangeliſtes, and the Alcaran, was fully ratified by the mediation of <hi>George</hi> the <hi>Deſpot</hi> of * <hi>Seruia</hi> and <hi>Ruſcia:</hi> which notwithſtanding was ſoone after violated, by the means<note place="margin">This is the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Miſia, by the Turkes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Segoria,</note> which I will now ſhew you.</p>

And that ſuch oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity which then was offered, ought not to be loſt and omitted: that now this curſed and wicked nation might be either rooted out in a manner without anie fight, or at leaſt wiſe chaſed and driuen ſo farre off, that they ſhould be no more heard nor ſpoken of.

recouery of your owne eſtate, but alſo for that by your vertue and prudence, the ſame hath bene couragiouſly defended. In this then doe we ſolace and reioyce our ſelues both with you, and with all Chriſtendome: conſidering that the diuine cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency and your valour, hath giuen ſuch ſuccours and comfort to the publique weale and eſtate Chriſtian. For to ſpeake the trueth, the loſſe of the nation of <hi>Albanois</hi> hath beene ſuch a wound that wee may continually bewaile it, as much as any one of our other miſhappes and misfortunes: at that time when <hi>Iohn Caſtriot</hi> your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (whom God pardon) a Prince (as I vnderſtand of excellent merite and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert,) being oppreſſed by <hi>Amurath,</hi> and taken out of this world by the vngratefull deſtenies, had neither the meanes to leaue vnto you the inheritaunce of his Crowne and Scepter (as vnto his Sonne, being then vnder the yoke and bondage of a ſtranger) nor yet was able otherwiſe to prouide for his affaires. O that it had pleaſed God, that this Father being moſt happy and fortunate in ſuch a Sonne had bene now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing: no greater bliſſe could haue befallen him, whereby to ſurmount all humaine felicity, then to haue ſeene you before his death.

               <hi>Amurath:</hi> howbeit that the newes of his deſaſter oftentimes reiterated, had made way before him. Some ſay that he was ſharply reproued by the <hi>Ottoman,</hi> who obiected vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by way of reproach, that it was not likely that ſo puiſſant an army could haue bene almoſt wholly ruinated without ſome great and notable cowardize, or ſome counſell raſh and timerous. Sometimes he would exclaime and ſay, that his army was betrayed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſometimes he would alleadge, that either it was ſurprized by the negligence of the Generall, or that in comming to the encounter, they had giuen the aduantage of the place vnto the enemy: whereof it proceeded that ſo great a deſaſter and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune had fallen vpon his people. Now albeit <hi>Haly</hi> Baſſa could not deny, but hee had bene ouerreached and preuented by our ambuſhments, the which might haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued any man, were he neuer ſo polliticke, ſubtill, and circumſpect, yet did he excuſe himſelfe neuertheleſſe, calling his ſouldiours to witneſſe, that there was nothing in him to be reprehended, but the variable and inconſtant chaunce and lotte of Armes: and that there wanted neither good order, nor diſcipline, nor the aduauntage of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:13368:41"/>
place, nor the oportunity of charging at a fit and conuenient time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Finally that neither the ſouldiours did faile their Captaine, nor the Captaine their ſouldiours. But if it would pleaſe his Maieſty, to permit him once more to attempt and make triall of his Fortune; he would make him to ſee, that he had a deuiſe and ſtratageme, by which he would bring it to paſſe, that this proſperity of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> ſhould proue dolefull and lamentable. The vaine promiſes of the Baſſa did ſoone moue the <hi>Sultan,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now more animated then euer, was willing that in any caſe new forces ſhoulde ſpeedily be prouided, if the other Baſſaes and Councellours, eſpecially <hi>Caly Baſsa,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him to change his aduiſe, had not ſhewed him: That another war of greater dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty and conſequence did fall vpon his ſhoulders, that the enterpriſe of <hi>Epyre</hi> might with ſafety, either be deferred or omitted, but ſo could not the tumults of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> but that it behoued him carefully to attend and looke vnto them.</p>
            <p>In the middeſt of theſe affaires, the letters of King <hi>Vladiſlaus</hi> being brought to <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> were a ſpeciall meane and occaſion to moue and induce him to giue him aide and ſuccours. For a more honeſt cauſe and fitter occaſion of warre, could not<note place="margin">Scanderbeg calleth a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the Albanois to conſult vpon the ſending of ſuccours to the king of Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> haue bene found then was the ſame miniſtred at that time. This notwithſtanding, for that he would determine nothing without the aduiſe of thoſe with whoſeayde he was to ſerue him ſelfe vppon all occaſions: hauing called together his chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, he would that the kings letters ſhould be read openly in full aſſembly of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall councell. And there was not any one who did diſalow of that warre, for that the exceſsiue greatneſſe of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire encreaſing from day today, did animate euery one with the ſpurres of wrath and indignation: and did ſollicite their mindes, almoſt trembling and quaking for feare of more grieuous inconueniences: and did ad mouiſh all the world of the vnfortunate condition of the Chriſtians, and of the former fortune ſometimes inuincible of the Hungarians, the which if <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath</hi> ſhould once caſt to the ground, euery man did propound and ſet before his eyes, both in publique and in priuate a finall deſolation; conſidering that there was no where to be found any puiſſance more ſufficient, or better able to ſuſtaine the feeble and weake eſtate of Chriſtendome for any long ſeaſon, nor which could with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall warres and endleſſe hoſtility, repreſſe the Turkiſh malice, whom the inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and pride of ſo many victories, had made to be their deadly and extream<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Moreouer, the hope of the Epirots was ſo augmented by the happy ſucceſſe of that victory lately befallen them; that they went euery where ſaying and promiſing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them ſelues, that they ſhould finde the like fortune: eſpecially ſeeing they changed not their Chiefe, nor their enemy, but the place of the warre onely. To conclude, all of them did affirme, that it behoued them, and they ought to aduenture the loſſe of their liues for the gaining and getting vnto themſelues, ſo great and puiſſant a king to be their friend in this troubleſome ſeaſon, againſt the inconſtancy of fortune, and ſo many humaine accidentes. Wherefore it was concluded without contradiction, that ſuccours ſhould be ſent him, but as touching the number of the men of warre, and the forces of thoſe ſuccours, they could not ſo ſoone be accorded and agreed: and this difference continued amongeſt them till the darke of the euening came vpon them. Many opinions being laied downe on the one ſide and the other touching this point, ſome agreed vppon eight thouſand, others vppon fiue, and the moſt part offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red fewer, ſhewing that there was no reaſon to disfurniſh the Prouince of men, the warre being on all ſides kindled, and the enemy (it might be) yet boyling in deſpite vpon the confines of <hi>Macedony,</hi> and that they ought not to thinke, becauſe the Baſſa had bene lately beaten, that therefore the warre was ended and determined: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it wanted ſo much that the Turkiſh forces were thereby weakened, or their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:13368:41"/>
diminiſhed; that on the contrary, he was by reaſon thereof much more enflamed and incenſed. Some alſo made a doubt, and it was long debated with great diuerſity of opinions, whether <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> himſelfe ſhould march thither in perſon, or whether they ſhould onely ſend aide and ſuccours vnto the king, for that without the infinite diſcommodity of the proceedings and affaires of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> and his eſtate not yet throughly ſettled and confirmed, he could not well be abſent, nor leaue the care and adminiſtration of the ſame: that his preſence (if need were) in time of peace or of warre, would be of great conſequence and moment, conſidering that the people of <hi>Albany</hi> would acknowledge no other ſoueraigne to command ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that al things, he being in place and preſence, would ſucceed well, and floriſh by his aduiſe and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell: But he being abſent, it could not be otherwiſe then a caſe moſt pittifull, to ſee the deformity that would enſue within the countrey, by the negligence and ſecurity both of the citizens, and of others of all eſtates and qualities, who for griefe and ſorrow which they ſhould conceaue at his departure, would ſuffer the vigour and liuelineſſe of their ſpirites to vaniſh and to relent.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Albany,</hi> albeit he had not determined any way to alter or change his firſt reſolution, yet becauſe he would not ſeeme to diſdaine or to make litle reckoning of the loue and good will of his ſubiects (whom he could not vpon the difficulties of that voyage openly contradict) nor yet to repugne againſt their offer of ſo ſmal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of ſouldiours, for feare leaſt he ſhould ſeeme willing to draw them on by force to a ſtraunge warre, and to be the cauſe of new perils and dangers vnto them, he iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it no leſſe conuenient for the common profite, then for his owne in particular to be ſilent, and to vſe litle or no ſpeech in the matter. But the vehemency and earneſtneſſe of <hi>Paul Ducagin</hi> (whoſe ſpeach was worthy and well beſeeming ſo excellent a prince) did ſoone cut off all theſe diſputes and diuerſities of opinions: and did in an inſtant ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe all theſe difficulties, that ſo troubled their mindes, thus ſpeaking vnto them.</p>

But I aſſure you, there is no ſuch matter as you thinke of, for that I ſee not that you haue laied downe or expounded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing which is correſpondent to the greatneſſe and Maieſty, either of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> or of the name of the <hi>Albanois.</hi> Pardon me though I ſay ſo (for in generall <q>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelles this hath euer bene allowed as a ſpeciall priuiledge, for each man to ſpeake free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and at liberty, and to be heard quietly and patiently.) And therefore if it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for me now to diſcourſe vppon theſe your conſultations of the warre of <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:</hi> much more willingly would I hearken vnto thoſe who would reſolutely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of ſending any ſuccours at all vnto the King: and would rather decree and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine (and that not vnaduiſedly) that the ruine and deſtruction of our neighbours, and the perillous eſtate of ſtraungers were not to be preferred nor regarded before our domeſticall miſchieues, and our owne proper neceſsities. For is there (I pray you) any thing ſo ridiculous, as to heare you to count ſome vppon eight, ſome vpon fiue thouſand ſouldiours, and ſome vppon fewer, to vphold the waight and burthen of ſuch a warre and ſo important, as if you were to thinke that a King ſo puiſſant and mighty, would demaund out of the whole countrey of <hi>Epyre</hi> ſo ſmall a number, in the extremity, and (as it were) the laſt triall of his Fortune? Shall <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> be ſo meanely accompanied into the middeſt of the <hi>Varnian</hi> fieldes, where all men in generall doe attend and wiſhe for him? Shall ſo many Princes and great Lordes of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> and of the Chriſtian Army, ſee your chiefe and ſoueraigne (whoſe glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous renowme is now diſperſed and gone into all partes before him) ſhall he I ſay be
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:13368:42"/>
ſeene marching before a handfull of men, no otherwiſe then as one accompanied with ſo many theeues and robbers? Admit (which God defend) that he ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be ouerthrowen and vanquiſhed, well and iuſtly might the enemy mocke and ieſt at the miſhappe of his diſcomfiture, much more his owne ſubiectes, in that hee would aduenture to conduct into a forraine countrey, and into an other mans domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions ſo ſmall a number of men as would ſcant be in ſafety within their owne home and dwellings. Contrariwiſe, if he ſhould ouercome and get the victory, litle praiſe and leſſe profite would come of it. Some others there be, who with a deuiſe all new and not heard of, would that forces ſhould be ſent to the King for his ſuccour, but they would not that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> ſhould bowdge, that forſooth a regard ſhould be had of his Citizens, or of the vnruly multitude, who would hardly be brought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue or admit the command of any ſecond or inferiour perſon. This is the point (my maiſters) wherein conſiſteth all our difference: either that abſolutely (as I haue ſayd) we doe refuſe to ſend the King any ſuccours, or elſe that you chaunge your aduiſe and opinion. What ſhall we ſend theſe triumphant ſuccors vnto the Hungarians with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> whoſe onely name will yeeld them more ſuccour, then if all of vs were with them and he abſent? whom they eſpecially doe inuite, and whom all of them doe demaund and ſeeke after? Let vs ſend them then a gods name, if any be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to goe without him. Cannot your Citizens liue one day in reſt and quiet without <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> and will you that the ſouldiour being in armes, ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the aduenture of forraine ſeruice without his Captaine? Do you thinke that our houſes and our countrey ſhall be in danger without his aſsiſtance? and ſhall the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour finde him ſelfe ſafe and ſecure in a ſtraunge countrey and a farre off, being ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and farre remoued from his accuſtomed Chiefetaine and Generall? What is then to be done? On the one ſide your forces doe hate and abhorre to go into <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> without their <hi>Scanderbeg:</hi> and on the other ſide, the loue of your countrey, and the deſire of your fellow Citizens doth reſtraine and withhold you. For my part my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe is, that a ſpeedy leauy be made as great and as puiſſaunt as may be, that wee loſe not the occaſion of this warre propoſed and laied before vs: and during the other affaires and buſineſſes of the <hi>Ottoman,</hi> let vs not doubt the eſtate of our owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. Furthermore, who is he that will not promiſe and aſſure him ſelfe of an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted victory, by the iſſue of this encounter?

As touching <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> there is not any one of you but will confeſſe, that it is more eaſie for you to finde a man to gouerne you in peace, and to adminiſter iuſtice, then to conduct and lead ſouldiours marching with their Armes. But to the intent you may not thinke that in this diſcourſe, I bring you nothing but great and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wordes: Behold here am I, who doe offer my ſelfe with fiue thouſand men to the warre of <hi>Hungarie:</hi> and (if neede be) doe vow and conſecrate my life for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of Ieſus Chriſt, principally, and next for the glory and reputation of all of you: and for <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> his honour, name and dignity.</q>

I am exceeding glad, and doe take ſingular contentment in this laudable deuotion and forwardneſſe of mine owne people, both in regard of your ſelfe, and in the behalfe of the common and publike cauſe: in that our men of warre, and all other my ſubiectes of all eſtates and degrees (without any perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion vſed on my part) doe ſhew them ſelues ſo chearefully and couragiouſly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in defence of the faith and Chriſtian religion, and ſo well affectioned towardes your Maieſtie.

            <p>Theſe letters being diſpatched away to the King, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> applied and bent all his mind and ſtudy for the leuying of forces. Firſt of all, thoſe companies which had<note place="margin">An army lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uied by Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg for the aid of the king of Hungary.</note> foughten againſt <hi>Haly</hi> Baſſa, he cauſed to be made ſtrong with new ſupplies, not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering any one of them to abſent him ſelfe from this voyage: And he was fully deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined not to vſe any idle and vnprofitable perſons in this iourney, but ſuch onely as ſhould be willing and reſolutely minded. Then hauing ſent publique Commiſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners throughout the Prouince to that effect, he had ſoone raiſed and enrolled to the number of ten thouſand more. <hi>Paul Ducagin</hi> did moſt largely make proofe by the effect and by his deeds, of the good mind and affection which he had before in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, made ſhew of by his ſpeaches. For comming to preſent him ſelfe to <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg,</hi> euen with the formoſt, beſides his owne perſon, he brought with him alſo, fiue thouſand all choſen and picked men, and ſingularly well appointed.

diuine maieſtie with their prayers and ſupplications, as they did at that time for the happy returne of their ſouldiers, who were then to march out of their owne country. All things both diuine and humane being thus well ordered &amp; diſpoſed, the ſoldiers now drawne from their natiue home, did take vnto them a new kind of courage; and their minds and imaginations were continually deuiſing vpon no other thing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had they ought elſe before their eyes, but the warre of <hi>Hungary:</hi> neither did they carrie the ſhew and countenance of any other then of ſuch men as had bene euen lately accuſtomed and exerciſed to embrue themſelues in the bloud of their enemies.</p>
            <p>Thus with great and exceeding ioy had they aduanced their enſignes euen to the<note place="margin">Scanderbeg marching with his armie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, is hindered by the Deſpot of Miſia.</note> frontiers of <hi>Miſia,</hi> when that either cruell Fortune, or the immortall and ſecret order and decree of the heauenly powers, or (which is moſt likely) the indignity &amp; hateful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſinnes and wickedneſſe of the Chriſtians, which ſeemed now to approch neare to receiue their deſerued puniſhment from the deuine maieſtie, did raiſe &amp; ſtirre vp the diſloyaltie and periurie of one wretched perſon, to trouble &amp; breake the courſe of theſe glorious attempts: cauſing both perpetuall matter of lamentation to the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians,</hi> and a moſt memorable loſſe and calamity to the eſtate &amp; wealth of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. This was <hi>George VVhoruich</hi> (of whom we haue made ſo often mention) at that<note place="margin">George Deſpot of Miſia his deſcription.</note> time called and commonly named the Lord or <hi>Deſpot</hi> of <hi>Seruia:</hi> a man (if ſuch graces and accomplements had any way furthered his vertues and good behauiour) of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall beauty, and of an excellent maieſtie and countenance moſt gracious &amp; venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and one that in eloquence and grauitie of ſpeech was moſt rare &amp; admirable, and not inferior to any of his time, deſcended of a noble and ancient familie, and very aged and well growne in yeares. As concerning his faith and religion (that we may not in this alſo omit his impietie) he was one that did altogether neglect and contemne it: for being a verie Atheiſt, and hauing his pernicious mind deuoyd of all pietie, feare,<note place="margin">His irreligion, atheiſme and impietie.</note> and reuerence of the Deitie, he did equally and alike contemne and deride both the precepts of Chriſtianitie, and the traditions of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> On a time (long after the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell of <hi>Varna</hi>) when this old Prince, being at leaſt ninety yeares of age, and flying from the face and preſence of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> did happen to come into <hi>Hungarie,</hi> to deſire their ayde and ſuccours againſt the Turkes, he chanced to fall in companie with a notable zealous preacher Frier <hi>Iohn Capiſtran</hi> of the order of <hi>S. Francis,</hi> vnto whom (after he<note place="margin">Frier Iohn Capiſtran.</note> had heard him make many excellent and holy diſcourſes touching his reuolt and apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faith of Chriſt, it is reported, that he made him this anſwer; That ſooner <q>&amp; more eaſily he could be perſwaded to hang himſelf, then to abiure thoſe traditions (though he were now paſt ninetie yeares of age) which he had reciued from his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers: giuing vs thereby to vnderſtand how dangerous a thing it is, to make a mock and ieſt of religion, and of the Sonne of God, and to follow after peruerſe and falſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, when they ſhall once grow to haue gotten an habit within vs.</q> For the <hi>Deſpot</hi> in this perſwaſion retyring himſelfe from the preſence of the Frier, was heard often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to reiterate and repeate theſe words. That he had rather his ſubiects ſhould call <q>him a Prince miſerable and vnfortunate, then an old and aged dotard.

vnto him. For this cauſe vnderſtanding of the preparations made for the warre of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> and of the comming of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> who approched neare his borders: he ſtopped vp all the wayes and paſſages, and debarred him from entring within his <q>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. <hi>Caſtriot</hi> did aſſay, but all in vaine, by his Ambaſſadors ſent to the <hi>Deſpot,</hi> to<note place="margin">Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors ſent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Scanderbeg to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpot of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to graunt him paſſage tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row his coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trey.</note> admoniſh him of the wrong and iniurie which he offred him: and he intreated him in friendly ſort, That he might not be the firſt which ſhould charge him with ill dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, who had giuen him no cauſe of offence and iniurie: that he would not of his friend and neighbour, purchaſe him for his enemie, and draw vpon him ſelfe the arms both of all <hi>Hungarie</hi> and <hi>Epire.</hi> That he would not ſuffer and procure by his meanes and occaſion onely, ſo great a loſſe and miſchiefe to all Chriſtendome, which might ſwallow vp both himſelfe &amp; his eſtate and Empire. For albeit in regard of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he did ſo cleaue and adhere vnto <hi>Amurath,</hi> yet he ſhould not thereby hope and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect for any other then certaine loſſe &amp; aſſured dammage: hauing had good proofe &amp; experience both of the infidelitie and periurie of his ſonne in law, &amp; of the great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures &amp; benefites which the Hungarians on the other part had often times done him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe perſwaſions nothing preuailing in a mind ſo depraued and corrupted, and the Prince of <hi>Epire</hi> now perceiuing that he was out of all hope to get paſſage by anie other meanes then by the ſword, he fully reſolued with him ſelfe to take that courſe: notwithſtanding that both it diſpleaſed him highly, &amp; that he held it a matter of ſome danger and difficultie to begin the warres ſo neare his owne home, and to hazard his forces at that time to the trauell of armes, which hee had thought to haue reſerued whole, freſh and ſound, and to haue made proofe and triall of them againſt the royall armie of a more worthie and ſtronger enemie.</p>

The Turkes were the firſt that beganne the fight, the which hauing continued for a while; the vantgard of the Turkiſh armie<note place="margin">The battell of Varna betwen Vladiſlaus king of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murath the great Turke.</note> was receiued ſo couragiouſly, and preſſed with ſuch furie by the Chriſtians, that (as if the victorie had beene alreadie gotten by them) the ſame was ſoone diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered and put to flight, and purſued more then two miles off: in ſo much that <hi>Amurath</hi> himſelfe had beene driuen to ſhift for his owne ſafetie, if the two Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes of <hi>Varadia</hi> and <hi>Strigonia</hi> (who were better skilled in their Portuiſſe then practiſed in armes) had not disbanded them ſelues vnaduiſedly, and forſaken the<note place="margin">Biſhops of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radia &amp; Stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonia by their folly, hinder the victorie of the Chriſtians.</note> place aſſigned them, onely for the chaſing of the enemie on that ſide where they were broken: which was the occaſion that a great and freſhe troope of Turkiſh archers on horſebacke, charging in flancke on that ſide which they had abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and left vndefended, did finde an eaſie entrie in vppon them: and they great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubled the rankes of our footemen, with a ſhower and tempeſt (as it were) of their ſhotte and arrowes, which they powred vppon them thicke and thinne. <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyades</hi> with his Valachians running ſpeedily thither, preſently vppon his arriuall chaunged the fortune of the fight which continued for a long time doubtfull and vncertaine.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:13368:45"/>
whereſoeuer he ſaw his owne forces to haue the worſt, he ſuccoured the left wing: which as then alſo was ſore encombred, and was not able to ſuſtaine and endure the ſhocke of the enemy: but he notwithſtanding ſtill vphelde and maintained them in good point. Yet would he not hinder but that <hi>Amurath</hi> in the meane time, founde the leaſure &amp; opportunity to re-ally himſelfe, and by the encouragement of <hi>Haly</hi> Baſſa he made head with his ſquadron of Ianiſſaries, and renued the perill of the encounter. <hi>Hunyades</hi> was in great doubt &amp; feare of his young king, whoſe fiery and haughty cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage did giue him great cauſe to ſuſpect ſome hazard and miſaduenture by his raſhnes and temeritie.

Great was the number both of men and horſes which were there laide on the ground: ſome of them being ſlaine, and others hauing their legges cut off or maymed. In ſo much, that they could not any longer march vppon the plaine ground, but they were conſtrained to make themſelues way vppon the heapes of dead bodies: ech preſſing and ruſhing vppon others ſo egerly and fiercely, that a man would haue iudged it rather a meere rage and furie, then any ardent and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment deſire of victorie, that animated them on in this conflict. The Ianiſſaries ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuſtained the force and violence of the Hungarians which were in company with their king, yet did he himſelfe in the end breake in amongſt them, and they moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiquely receiued him into the middeſt of their battallion, whereof it enſued; That being held either as dead, or taken priſoner, at the ſame inſtant that the Turkes were now turning their backes, and readie to flie away: the Chriſtians alſo on the other ſide, as hauing left their king did beginne to abandon the place, and in ſteede of fighting, fell to plaine flying.

            <p>Vpon theſe alterations <hi>Iohn Hunyades</hi> ſeeing the Chriſtians in diſaray, and moſt fearefully and ſhamefully to forſake their rankes, he made himſelfe way through the <q>middeſt and thickeſt of the preſſe: and being come to the place where <hi>Vladiſlaus</hi> then<note place="margin">Hunyades perſwadeth Vladiſlaus to retyre and to preuent an vtter ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe.</note> was, he ſhewed him the diſorder, the affray, and confuſion of the Chriſtians, hee cryed and called vnto him, he requeſted and entreated him to turne bridle and to yeelde vnto the preſent miſchance, and not to hazard all to vtter miſchiefe, and to the misfortune of an entire diſcomfiture: that there was as yet great good hope of the victorie, and that it attended and ſtayed for him, conſidering that the loſſe on his ſide was ſo ſmall and of ſo litle account, that it appeared in a manner, as none at all: and that therefore it were good he did retire himſelfe within his Chariots and tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches with his men ſafe and ſound as they were, ere they were altogether ſcattered and diſperſed. For the loſſe of his life alone, would not onely hazard and endaunger his owne realmes &amp; dominions, but the ſtate of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and the whole bodie of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome.</q> All theſe perſwaſions and reaſons notwithſtanding, the king ſtill thruſting himſelfe moſt vndiſcreetly into the midſt of his enemies, after a ſharpe &amp; furious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict (his horſe being wounded &amp; hought) he was in the end ouerthrown to the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<note place="margin">Vladiſlaus king of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie ſlaine by the Turkes.</note> and ſo ſlaine in the companie of many of his Nobles both Hungarians &amp; Polonians. <hi>Hunyades</hi> for a time held good, and made reſiſtance, endeuouring and aſſaying diuers times, to haue reſcued the kings body, but all was in vaine. For the head being cut off, and faſtened vpon the end of a launce: the Chriſtians vppon ſight thereof, being on all partes terrified and abaſhed, did ſeeke by maine flight to purchaſe the ſecuritie of

their owne perſons: excepting certaine Valachians with whom their Chiefe and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<note place="margin">Huniades his flight and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment by the Deſpot of Servia.</note> 
               <hi>Huniades</hi> (ſeeing that he could not ſtand againſt the huge multitudes of the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels) tooke part alſo with the reſt in the retreate: Holding it no diſgrace after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe of the king, that ſome ſhould remaine to reuenge the ignominie of this ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe, and to extinguiſh the memorie of ſo diſhonorable a defeat. And therefore as well as he could, he ſaued himſelfe, taking his courſe after the ſunne ſet towardes the coaſts and confines of <hi>Seruia:</hi> where he was ſtaied and made priſoner, and moſt ſhamefully put in irons by the <hi>Deſpot,</hi> being reſtrained of his libertie till ſuch time as thoſe townes, whereunto he pretended a right, were firſt yeelded and reſtored vnto him. The Cardinall <hi>Iulian</hi> (the authour and procurer of the breach of peace which had beene ſworne betweene the Turkes and the Chriſtians) made there alſo his laſt end: howbeit <note n="*" place="margin">Callimachus.

And that being ſo ſlaine, he was ſpoyled and left naked, hauing ſuffered many reproches as he was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vp the ghoſt, for his ill and wicked counſell in procuring of this warre. The two<note place="margin">Biſhops of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radia &amp; Stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonia drowned in the mudde.</note> Biſhops were likewiſe drowned in the mud, as they fled into the next mariſhes. Thus you ſee the euent and ſucceſſe of this iourney, ſo famous and memorable, which coſt the Conquerour greater loſſe &amp; bloudſhed, then it did to the partie conquered. Some alſo doe report, that <hi>Amurath</hi> after he had eſcaped this daunger, did ſhewe himſelfe<note place="margin">Victorie of the Turkes with great loſſe and bloudſhed.</note> much more ſad and penſiue then he was vſually accuſtomed: and being therfore bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by his ſeruants, he made them this anſwere; I would be loath, quoth he, often to gaine in this manner. In that place where the battell was foughten, and the dead bodie of the king found, <hi>Amurath</hi> cauſed a mightie piller to be erected, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription for a monument of his victorie: and at this day are yet to be ſeene diuerſe mounts and litle hils, made with the bones of thoſe who were there ſlain and buried, which doth argue that the ſlaughter was great and wonderfull: which fell out on the day and feaſt of Saint <hi>Martin,</hi> the eleuenth of Nouember, in the yeare of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. 1443.</p>
            <p>This battell is ſomewhat otherwiſe deſcribed by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the ſecond, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we in this place haue followed <hi>Callimachus,</hi> who hath ſet it downe with a moſt excellent and good grace, and without any partialitie. This is moſt certaine and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that the Chriſtians euen to this day, may finde good and ſufficient cauſe to be diſcontented with the <hi>Deſpot</hi> of <hi>Miſia,</hi> for keeping the bands &amp; army of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> from being preſent at that battell, by reaſon of his faithleſſeneſſe and diſloyaltie. For it could not be but the good deuoire and prowes of ſo many thouſandes of reſolute fighting men would haue done much, &amp; the only valure of <hi>Hunyades</hi> ſeconded with the ſufficiencie and good fortune of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> how could it but haue wrought ſome notable &amp; ſingular effect? And what could haue hindered them, but that they would haue borne a great ſtroake in the happie euent &amp; good ſucceſſe of that battell? What ſight or ſpectacle more famous and notable could any man haue ſeene in any age, then a battell foughten againſt the enemies of Chriſtendome, and directed by two ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and renowmed Chieftaines? Both of them were moſt hardie and valiant ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,<note place="margin">Compariſon of Hunyades and Scanderbeg.</note> and moſt expert and accompliſhed Captaines, of wonderfull great force and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſtrength of their bodies, and equall and alike in greatneſſe of courage. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit more fortunate was the latter, being one that had fortune alwaies more fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto him, as appeared afterwards in the whole courſe of his life. <hi>Hunyades</hi> was more aged and ſtriken in yeares: <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> much younger and leſſe exerciſed at that time in armes. And albeit he had not bene in ſo many conflicts and foughten fieldes,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:13368:46"/>
yet had he continually good and happie ſucceſſe: being as fortunate in priuate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats betweene man and man, as in the maine fight of plaine and ſet battelles. Both of them were verie acceptable and agreeable to the minds and good liking of their ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, but <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> was of a more pleaſant conceit and diſpoſition. The one did ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or neuer exchange the ſeruice either of the Valachians or Hungarians: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was much delighted, and did often ſerue himſelfe of the Italians in his conqueſts: taking a ſingular pleaſure in the vſe of their armes, and in their counſell and aduiſe. <hi>Huniades</hi> neuer knew other enemies then the Turkes: <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> in the warre of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie</hi> when he reſtored the libertie of the kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> in the aide of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> king of <hi>Naples,</hi> did purchaſe to himſelfe no leſſe glorie and reputation, then he did by his often triumphes obtained againſt the barbarous infidels.</p>
            <p>This fame and report of the ouerthrow and diſcomfiture of the Chriſtians, being euerie where diſperſed, and <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> being certified (whileſt he was yet remaining in the limits of <hi>Seruia</hi>) of the grieuous calamitie and defait of the Hungarians; tooke on as if he would haue died for verie conceite and griefe of that miſfortune: and hauing a long while bethought himſelfe, and caſting vpon many matters in his minde, he reſolued at length to turne bridle, and to take his way to his owne country.

                  <p>All the honors and benefites, wherewith I could adorne, and raiſe thee to greatnes in my court, ſo long as thou wert with me, I neuer made ſpare of them, but beſtowed them bountifully vpon thee (ô <hi>Scanderbeg</hi>) of all men liuing the moſt vngratefull. I want fit words and termes to ſpeake vnto thee: ſuch is the multitude of thy crimes &amp; diſloialties, wherewith thou haſt offended my maieſtie, and wounded my verie ſoule, that I know not well what kind of ſpeech to vſe vnto thee, to thee I ſay, who wert my domeſticall and houſehold ſeruant: for neither will any rough or ſharpe languages mollifie thy hard harted courage, (whoſe nature is ſo fierce and arrogant) neither doeſt thou deſerue anie gracious wordes or kindnes of ſpeech: who haſt mightily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded and excelled in all kind of fiercenes and beaſtiallitie. And (that thou mighteſt omit no occaſion to make thee hatefull and odious vnto mee) thou haſt growen to that madnes, that thou diddeſt caſt aſide all care of thine owne benefit, and the ſafetie of thy citizens, in compariſon of that loue and affection which thou diddeſt carrie to the Hungarians, who were lately armed againſt me. I could be content to let paſſe in ſilence other matters, and not to touch and handle thoſe wounds which thou haſt made, if ſo be my minde might be once perſwaded to forget them, or that ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceites, or ſuch notable examples of an ingratefull part did deſerue to be concealed: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, I hold it neceſſarie at length (though perhaps ſomewhat too late) in ſome ſort to admoniſh thee, and to lay open before thee thy ill deſertes, ſo farre leaſt the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:13368:48"/>
furie of this thy pride and arrogancie do ſuddenly carrie thee away headlong to ruine and deſtruction, together with thy vnhappie and vnfortunate kingdome. And then thou wouldeſt be willing to make confeſſion of this the obſtinacie and error, at ſuch time as thou ſhalt not haue left vnto thee any helpe or remedie of thy affaires, being once brought to the exigent and extremitie of a moſt deſperate eſtate. We haue hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto enough &amp; too much endured theſe outrages, and too too much haſt thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire with thy great and intollerable iniuries: and yet haue I ſhewed my ſelfe too patient in ſuffering and tollerating ſo manie wronges and miſchieues. Doſt thou think that thou ſhalt be acquitted of that thy treacherie wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with thou betraiedſt my armie in <hi>Hungarie?</hi> doeſt thou imagine that thou ſhalt goe vnpuniſhed for the withdrawing of ſo many townes from my obeyſance in <hi>Epyre,</hi> and for ſo many of my garriſons which thou haſt cauſed to be ſlaine and murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? doeſt thou ſuppoſe that the other thy miſdeedes lately done and perpetrated, ſhall go free and vnchaſtized? as the armie of <hi>Haly</hi> Baſſa deſtroyed, ſo manie inuaſions and fierings of my territories, and the tumult of the warre of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> which to the vttermoſt of thy abilitie, euen of late, thou diddeſt further and ſet forwarde: beſides the ſpoyling of my father in lawe his dominions, becauſe he would not ſuffer thee to haue a paſſage through his Countrie? I would thou wouldeſt once at the laſt remember thy ſelfe moſt wicked wretch, and not continue any longer in expecting what wilbe the end and iſſue of this my diſpleaſure and iuſt indignation. Take heede that theſe ſlight enlargements of thy proſperitie, doe not ſo animate and encourage thy diſordinate appetite, and draw thee on with fooliſh deſire to that paſſe, that thy fortune (being hereafter made much more miſerable) doe moue euen thoſe that hate thee (my ſelfe eſpecially) to the pitie and compaſsion of thy hard and wretched eſtate. If there be leſt any curteſie or humanitie in thy deſperate and graceleſſe mind, remember thy ſelfe yet at the laſt, of the bountifull benefites which thou haſt receaued of me, and giue me no longer occaſion to repent me that I haue beſtowed them ſo vnthankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Although it be an vnſeemely and vnciuill part to obiect vnto any man the good &amp; liberalitie that hath bene ſhewed him; yet is it a token of too too great ingratitude ſo ſoone and eaſilie to forget the merite of fore-paſſed benefits: wherefore I cannot but be ſorrowfull for thy forrune (ô <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi>) and take pitie vpon thy vnhappy eſtate. For ſetting apart the ſafetie of thy ſoule (whereof as a man paſt all hope, and vtterly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ouer of the Phiſitian, thou takeſt no care nor makeſt any account or reckoning) not yet to ſpeake any thing of thy contempt of the lawes of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and of the ſmall eſtimat which thou makeſt of this diuine Prophet: was there any one thing of all thoſe vaine &amp; blind delights, wherein the thoughts of men do take a pleaſure, which I haue not moſt bountifully yeelded vnto thee, who art now caried away with the baſe and vile regard of thy poore and ſorie kingdome? Hadſt thou not plentie of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, horſes, great and huge traines of ſlaues, aboundance of gold, ſiluer and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluitie of all other things, which do commonly allure and entiſe all eſtates and ages to affect them? Diddeſt thou euer want any fit or continuall occaſions to exerciſe thy vertue, or to aduance thee to the glory of great eſtates, and places of charge, either in peace or warre? or to any kinde of honours which were fit and agreable to thy yeares? In ſumme, who, in all my courts, was a greater fauorite, and more in my grace then thy ſelfe? was there either ſtranger or naturall ſubiect, who amongſt my moſt inward and ſecret friends was more pleaſing and acceptable vnto me? How carefully and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently did I prouide to haue thee nouriſhed and brought (vp from the time thou wert firſt brought vnto me) in knowledge and learning, in good manners and diſcipline? &amp; how willingly and continually did I aduaunce the forwardneſſe of thy vertue, which
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:13368:48"/>
I ſaw to grow and encreaſe daily? ſometimes by recompences and rewardes, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by all poſſible meanes of praiſe and commendation? And as for the honor and renowne of armes (then the which nothing is to be accounted or helde more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable or commendable,) therein I made thee ſo glorious, that in all kinde of ſeruices whatſoeuer, neither did I take notice of any ſouldier in regard of thee, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did I ſeeme to ſet by any of my Captaines in compariſon of the grace and honor which I did vnto thee. For all theſe my merits and good deſerts, thou (ô <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg</hi>) haſt now at length well rewarded me: hauing ſhewed thy ſelfe to be ſuch a one, that it ſeemeth I haue not exalted the man I tooke thee for: but that I haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed a plague and peſtilence within mine owne houſe and familie. But be it that the loue of thy natiue countrie did wound thy ſoule, and ſollicite thee to doe as thou haſt done; if thou hadſt required me to reſtore the ſame vnto thee, doeſt thou thinke that I would haue denied it vnto thee, ſeeing that ſo often and vndemaunded (if thou liſt to remember it) I did freely and voluntarily make offer of the ſame vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee? But thou notwithſtanding haddeſt rather to haue it of thy ſelfe by thy owne miſdeedes and iniquitie, then as a benefite receiued from me, or as a gift proceeding from my bountie. Keepe it therefore ſtill in the name of God: neither ſhall I be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented therewithall, and I proteſt vnto thee (ſo great is my clemencie towardes all thoſe that haue beene in any ſort familiarly knowen vnto me) that I doe nowe freely pardon all former faults and offences, not for any merit of thine owne (which is iuſt none at all) but I doe it becauſe euen in the middeſt of this publique hatred and diſlike, it pleaſeth me to call to minde both the manifolde benefites which thou haſt receiued from me, and that firſt faith and loyaltie which I did once finde in thee, when thou wert with me: for that of longer time and continuance was the good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice which thou diddeſt me, then the offences wherewith thou haſt wronged mee. Both <hi>Croy,</hi> and the ſtate of thy father (although thou haſt ſeized vpon them by fraude and treacherie) doe I permit thee to enioy frankely; on this condition, that thou doe voluntarily reſigue or reſtore thoſe other townes of <hi>Epyre,</hi> wherein thou haſt no right nor intereſt, and which doe in equitie appertaine vnto me, who haue here<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tofore purchaſed them by the fortune of warres, and by mine owne vertue. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that thou doe preſently and without delay repoſſeſſe my father in law of all the goods of the Miſians as farre as may be, and what is wanting to ſupply and make good with money: and that from hencefoorth (during thy life) thou holde it no leſſe crime then fellonie, to offer any violence, either to him or to anie other whom we repute to be our friends: or by any manner of meanes whatſoeuer to grace, aide, or comfort our enemies; in ſo doing, thou maieſt for euer ſhunne and auoide the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and hatred of the Turkes, and ſo ſhalt thou haue my good grace and fauour nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more nor leſſe, then thou haſt heretofore and in time paſt, if ſo be thou haddeſt not rather (though then all in vaine) to ſeeke place for repentance, when thou haſt bene beaten with the rod of thine owne miſerie, and when thine owne preſumption and audatious obſtinacie ſhall haue drawen me thither in perſon to take the reuenge thereof in a moſt mercileſſe and implacable maner. Thou knoweſt well the puiſſance of my forces, and thou art not ignorant of the force &amp; ſtrength of mine army.

Notwithſtanding ſome there were of opinion, that this deuiſe of <hi>Amurath</hi> was without any fraud or guile, and they did aſcribe it to a certen kind of feare and neceſſity, alleadging that the <hi>Sultan</hi> had bene <q>induced to make theſe offers and conditions of peace for doubt of the warre of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie,</hi> and through the vnweldines of his age, which was then growen verie great. Moreouer that the tender age of his ſonne <hi>Mahomet,</hi> being as yet vnfit and vnſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the charge and burthen of the Empire, did giue vnto the father great cauſe carefully to bethinke himſelfe of the future eſtate of his childe, meaſuring the forces of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> by the late ſlaughter of <hi>Haly</hi> Baſſa; and being as much feared and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, by reaſon of the ſingular faith and fidelitie which he ſawe ſo many people in <hi>Albanie</hi> beare vnto him, and the good will of the Chriſtians which did daily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe towardes him: that in the meane time neuertheleſſe, he did but diſſemble and make an outward ſhew, whileſt with a fained kind of feare, he demaunded of <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi> the reſtitution of thoſe townes, and a parte of <hi>Epire,</hi> and the reparation of the wrongs which had bene offered to his confederates: that he did ſet downe ſo manie conditions without reaſon or equitie, to the intent he might obtaine ſuch as were reaſonable and commodious: and that there was no doubt but he would be contented to accept of ſuch a peace, and to yeeld vnto ſuch termes of ſubmiſſion, as <hi>Castriot</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe would ſet downe, and preſcribe vnto him, without that he would make any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther queſtion, either of the loſſe of <hi>Epire,</hi> or of the warres of <hi>Miſia,</hi> ſo that the <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois</hi> could be content to abſtaine from armes, and to aſſure him of peace and quietnes. Wherfore, to make peace with <hi>Ottoman</hi> vpon theſe termes, and to conclude an abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from warre for a time; could not but be greatly for their honor and aduantage, and the rather, for that himſelfe was the firſt, that did motion and inuite them to a parley: that therefore it would not be otherwiſe, but that many and great commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties would thereby redound to all the inhabitants of that prouince: that the accidents and iſſues of warre are verie doubtfull: and it was a point of ſmall wiſedome: neither were they well aduiſed who would preferre troubles before reſt and quietnes: neither ought any man to ground the courſe and ſucceſſe of his good fortune, vpon the firſt beginnings of his good happe and proſperitie: that the Hungarians had more often and more happily foughten with the Turks, then had the Albanians: yet being now ouerwhelmed with their late miſfortune, they might in vaine frame their complaints<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> and record their vnſpeakeable dammages and loſſes: that therefore it was farre better by ſome acte and ſhew of courteſie and humanitie, to make a frend of an enemie: then to incenſe him more and more by diſdaining and refuſing the peace which he profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them ſo franckly.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe diſcourſes being thus debated in the preſence of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> (albeit in part<note place="margin">Scanderbeg excepteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the meſſenger and peace of Amurath</note> they had ſome appearance of truth) yet did he preſently impugne &amp; contradict them: ſeeming to bewaile and complaine againſt the follie of the Epirots, that they onely of all the nations of the world (to their owne exceſſiue dammage) ſhould be the laſt that would take notiſe of the wiles &amp; deceites of <hi>Ottoman:</hi> that it was a ſtrange thing, that the vaine, idle, and impertinent letters of <hi>Amurath</hi> ſhould meete and encounter with a beleefe and credulitie farre more vaine and ſottiſh, &amp; ſhould purchaſe any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit or faith among them: or that the wits of his people could be ſo dull and ſenceleſſe as to thinke that <hi>Airadin</hi> (being a Spie and Intelligencer) ſhould be reputed as one ſent vnto them in the name and credit of an ambaſſador. Beſides, admit there were no danger nor deceite in this matter, but that all things were according as <hi>Amurath</hi> had written, yet what lightnes and inconſtancie were this, to giue faith and credit to their
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:13368:49"/>
enemy rather then to their owne actes, and the eſtate of their owne affaires? And that the fortune of an other rather then their owne, ſhould make them to chaunge their counſailes and determinations concerning the peace &amp; the warres: true it is (quoth he) that <hi>Amurath</hi> is in the declining of his life, and that the Turkes at the battell of <hi>Varna</hi> haue receiued a mortall &amp; deadly blow. Beſides that other accidents do inuite the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians to deſire reſt and quietneſſe: but what ſhould theſe things giue any occaſion to the Albanians, either to abate or to looſe their courage, or to receiue ſuch condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of peace, as an enemy whom they had vanquiſhed ſhould dare to preſent vnto them who were the vanquiſhers? Neither was it any thing to be regarded that they imagined that ſome of thoſe conditions might be allowed and other ſome reiected: for they could not any way accept of peace but it would be moſt ignominious, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could they ſo warelie or circumſpectly handle the matter, but that the <hi>Sultan</hi> would ſoone perceiue both the fearefulneſſe of their mindes and the difference of their meanes: but admit that peace were made, and let it be imagined that <hi>Amurath</hi> would ſit ſtill and be glad of quietneſſe, till the tumultes, now growing vpon the late ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the Hungarians, were throughly appeaſed: and till ſuch time as he had quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the flame, that was now beginning to be kindled: it might be till then the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rots ſhould enioy the benefite of that peace, notwithſtanding afterwardes there was no other likelihood, but that he would turne the whole violence of the wars, vpon their neckes, and with his full forces would ſeeke to oppreſſe them, when they ſhould in vaine obiect vnto him the violating of the articles of agreement concluded betweene them. Neither was the age of <hi>Amurath</hi> ſo impotent and decrepit, that it would make him vtterly vnapt and vnable for the warres. For it was the counſell and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> of a Generall, which ought to be reſpected, not his bodily ſtrength &amp; puiſſance: and the prudence of the leaders was a matter in all ages more vſually to be redoubted, then the promptneſſe of the hand, or raſh temeritie and fooliſh hardineſſe in vſing of the ſword. That in his weake and feeble body, did remaine a ſpirite, ſound, quicke and watchfull to all aduantages &amp; opportunities, &amp; a hart full fraught with mortall hate &amp; extreme mallice. And though that <hi>Ottoman</hi> himſelf would not be dealing with them, yet it could not be but they ſhould find enemies. He forgot not alſo to ſhew them, that ſmall and ſhort could be the profit of that peace which they ſhould make with one ſo old, and who was now drawing to his laſt end, that the fierce and hautie courage and the reſtleſſe minde of his ſonne <hi>Mahomet</hi> would aime and attempt greater matters: ſo that they ſhould be ſure of peace, when warre was moſt for their profit: &amp; they ſhould not faile of warre when they would be glad of reſt and quietneſſe, by meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that which they ſhould do, ſhould not be for the benefit and good of the Epirotes, but for the profit and aduantage of the Turkes. What reaſon therefore had they to deſire peace, ſeeing that the victorie was euen already in their hands, and that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my himſelfe did ſeeme to auouch no leſſe, but openly to confeſſe it: wherefore then ſhould they not follow the proſperous winde, and pleaſant gale of their good fortune, and enioy the occaſion which was ſo freely offered them, whereof, if the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſhould once ſlide away or be let paſſe: in vaine would they repent hereafter that they had not laid better hold vpon it, that it was a ſhame for them now to ſpeake of compoſition: when the woundes lately receiued in the battell of <hi>Haly</hi> Baſſa were not yet cured, that they ſhould firſt recouer the Seate of their anceſtours, and aſſure the libertie of ſo many peoples their Subiectes: that then they ſhould finde the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie to accord, either by propounding or accepting honeſt and honorable conditions of peace and compoſition, is it poſsible, that the remembrance of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

that ſuch an accident and chance of warre ſhould alienate the mindes of the Epirotes from that warre more then the Hungarians, who had ſuſtained that ouerthrowe, for the report went amongſt the common people, that <hi>Huniades</hi> did burne in a vehement deſire to reuenge the loſſe and ignominie of the battell at <hi>Varna:</hi> and that he did ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plot and deuiſe the meanes to raiſe a new armie.</p>
            <p>Vpon theſe reaſons alleadged, all men were wonderfully encouraged, and in this<note place="margin">Subiects of Scanderbeg re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to holde warres with Amurath.</note> as in all other matters, they were obedient vnto <hi>Scanderbeg:</hi> his people alſo were verie much aggreiued, &amp; repented them that they had opened their mouthes in that matter which was not to his liking, all being vnwilling that he ſhould haue any conceipt, that they in any wiſe, or in any matter concerning his ſeruice would refuſe his aduiſe and counſell, which they had euer followed in the field and in the Campe. Whereupon the Prince of <hi>Albania</hi> hauing firſt of all called the Turkiſh Ambaſſadour to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, he held him in a long diſcourſe, ſometimes apart, and ſometimes in full aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of his ſubiectes: by a long narration of his loſſes and damages, both publique and priuate: and complaining himſelfe greatly of the diſloialtie and periurie of <hi>Amurath.</hi> And thus hauing gratiouſly entertained and bountifully feaſted him for fiue dayes, with a cheerefull and glad countenance, full of confidence and aſſurance, for feare leaſt he (which was ſent for a ſpie) ſhould coniecture or imagine any kind or apprehenſion of feare: he led him in his owne companie, and ſhewed him all the rampiers, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, and all the courtes of garde of his men of warre, giuing him alſo a ſight of the forme and manner of his campe, and then returned him with an anſwer in writing to this effect.</p>

God and man, as though that I had giuen thee &amp; not thou to me the firſt offence. Doeſt thou count this to be infidelitie, that I reuolted from following of thee, being compelled thereunto by neceſsitie? doeſt thou obiect this for a crime and reproch vnto me, that I recouered my Countrey by vertue and induſtrie? But go to, let it be ſo, neither doe I greatly care to be held guiltie of this treſpaſſe: the benefites alſo ſhewed me, which thou ſo at large and ſo orderly doeſt reckon vp, I my ſelfe could bee verie well content to remember them: were it not that the knowledge thereof doeth draw with it the dolorous remembrance of an infinite number of great and greeuous miſchiefes and calamities, the which, if the one ſhould bee compared and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with the other, aſſuredly the greatneſſe of the deſertes and merites would ſoone be buried and ouerwhelmed vnder a greater heape of the miſchiefes and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deedes.

How long did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou thinke that I would haue endured thy ſo inſolent and proud gouernment? Yet did I for a long time ſuffer many things, neither did I at any time refuſe the yoke in thy ſeruice. All my life time did I expoſe my ſelfe to all perils and daungers both publique and priuate, both of mine owne diſpoſition willingly, and at thy comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, to ſhewe my obedience and duty vnto thee: euery day did I heare ſpeaches diſperſed concerning thee, and amongeſt my friendes and familiars, I heard no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther talke ordinarily, then of thy ſnares and trappe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Leaue off therefore henceforth theſe thy ſharpe threates and menaces, and deſiſt from obiecting vnto vs ſo often the lamentable miſhappe and misfortune of the Hungarians.

In the meane while, neither will we take any conſell of our enemy of that we haue to doe, neither will we ſeeke or intreate for peace from thee: but relying vpon the diuine fauour and clemency, we will endeuour to triumph ouer thee, with a moſt glorious and triumphant victorie.</p>

For the rumours which aroſe daily from the part of <hi>Huniades,</hi> and the often meſſages of the vnfaithfull <hi>Deſpot</hi> of <hi>Miſia,</hi> that pernicious old wretch, who was now infamous through his double treaſons, and by the enuious deſtinies was reſerued, euen till that time, for ſo many miſeries and calamities to the Chriſtians: theſe conſiderations (I ſay) did tranſport and cary away his mind elſe where, and did hinder and trouble him from bending all his forces, and turning the waight and burthen of the whole warre vppon the kingdome of <hi>Epire.</hi> Meane while neuertheleſſe, to the intent the late iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry offered him by the contempt and refuſall of his friendſhippe and confederacy, might not reſt without ſome preſent kinde of puniſhment: he concluded that if he did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, yet he would trouble and moleſt the peace and quietneſſe of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> though he were not able vtterly to aboliſh it. To this effect he imagined that he had a fit and conuenient oportunity by the negligence of the Chriſtians, who (as he heard) were growen very careleſſe and ſecure, through their manifold good fortunes and happy ſucceſſe in the wars, and that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> hauing diſmiſſed his army, did keepe the field with his horſemen onely; who did daily and careleſlie range abroade farre from their Campe, here and there diſperſed and ſcattered for deſire of prey and pillage.<note place="margin">Feriſey ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murath.</note> For this cauſe hee cauſed <hi>Feriſey</hi> to be ſent for, who was one of his Baſſaes, a man of a ſtirring and fierce diſpoſition, and of a quicke and ready ſpirite. To him hee gaue in charge nine thouſand horſe, all choſen and picked men, and hauing heaped vpon him many great and large promiſes, in caſe he returned with victorie (as hee wiſhed and deſired) he commaunded him to enter into <hi>Epire,</hi> with all the ſpeede and ſecreſie that might be, that his comming might be felt before it was perceyued by the enemy. The reaſon that made <hi>Ottoman</hi> at that time to ſend no greater forces, was either for feare that delay and protracting of time might worke their dammage and diſaduantage, or that the rumour of his comming being blowen abroade and diuulged, might awaken the Chriſtians, and giue them time and leyſure, both to aduiſe themſelues, and to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew the perill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by addreſſing and preparing new ambuſhmentes, as the euent after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes made manifeſt, to fruſtrate and diſappoint the traines of him that was a maſter in ſuch arts and ſubtelties.</p>

from the common opinion, ſeeing that it is a matter yet freſh in memory, and many alſo haue committed no leſſe to writing, iuſtifying the ſame to all poſteritie: That <hi>Amurath</hi> in his latter dayes, immediately vppon the battell of <hi>Varna,</hi> meditating and lamenting, ſometimes vppon the miſeries and inconueniences of Princes, and ſometimes vppon the temeritie and inconſtancie of Fortune, after hee had ordered<note place="margin">Haly Baſſa go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of Mahomet the ſonne of Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath.</note> his domeſticall affaires, and appointed <hi>Halie</hi> Baſſa for gouernour to his eldeſt ſonne <hi>Mahomet,</hi> hee preſently depriued himſelfe of his Crowne and Empire, and leauing <hi>Andrinople,</hi> and the care of all publique matters, and retayning with him but a very ſmall number<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the companions of his counſell) hee retired him ſelfe into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> where he vowed and profeſſed a religious and a godly life, according to the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition of his forefathers. Neither did hee forſake that kinde of life, till ſuch time as the <hi>Deſpotte</hi> of <hi>Tranſiluania,</hi> namely <hi>Huniades,</hi> was come before <hi>Sophia:</hi> and that the cries and daily exclamations of the people, did reuoke him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alleadging that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> by reaſon of his young and tender yeares, was not able to ſupport and beare the heauy burthen and charge of the eſtate, and that the credite and authority of <hi>Halie</hi> Baſſa, was not of ſuch force in the Campe, as might make the ſouldiours to obey and reſpect him. Certainly I cannot but maruell from whence this erro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>But this errour proceedeth not from thence, for in the order and accompt of the times, will not be found anie confuſion or diſagreement, if wee ſhould graunt that theſe things did paſſe, before that euer <hi>Amurath</hi> did giue ouer and renounce his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. But herein my minde cannot be throughly ſatisfied, to ſee that the death of the <hi>Sultan</hi> ſhould be ſo vnaduiſedly tranſlated from <hi>Epire</hi> into <hi>Aſia.</hi> For in deed, there is nothing more contrarie to the trueth, and there was neuer any one heard of, that durſt maintaine or allow the contrarie, but that the ſiege of <hi>Croie</hi> did make an end<note place="margin">Amurath made his laſt end before Croy</note> of his aged yeares, and all ages enſuing will giue the honour of the death of <hi>Ottoman,</hi> vnto <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> as being conſumed and extinct through pure conceipt and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, and through impatiencie of griefe: for that hee could not preuaile againſt <hi>Croie.</hi> But the diſcretion and good iudgement of the Reader, will eaſily finde out theſe particularities, and the probability of the whole trueth of thoſe matters, by the diligent computation and conference of the times.</p>
            <p>But returne wee againe to <hi>Feriſey,</hi> who in great ſecreſie was entred into the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers<note place="margin">Feriſey cometh into Epire.</note> of <hi>Macedony,</hi> and did in vaine promiſe vnto him ſelfe the reward and honour of the victory, which he had before conceiued in his minde, puffed vp with ſo great and a vaine hope. And therefore ſtanding very carefully vppon his guard, he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched on, approaching daily nearer the enemy, in manner and countenaunce rather of a Robber, then of a true and iuſt warriour. And yet coulde not hee for all that preuent the newes of his arriuall. For <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> being admoniſhed of all thinges by the Garriſons, that were diſpoſed in diuerſe and ſundry places, or (as others write) by a ſpie, comming from the Court of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> ſodainely (as a man that went euer furniſhed and appointed to all caſualties and accidents of warre) taking the occaſion of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:13368:52"/>
time and place. He firſt of all ſeized vppon a certaine ſtreight and narrow valley na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med<note place="margin">The valley of Mocrea.</note> 
               <hi>Mocrea,</hi> (which was the onely place where the Turkiſhe Captaine was able to paſſe) and he diſpoſed it full of ſouldiours, all hardy men and well reſolued. The Baſſa began now to approach, and the huge thickneſſe of the duſt raiſed by the treading and trampling of their horſes, did euidently diſcouer that the enemy was neare at hand. Our men keeping their ſtand, did attend with no leſſe ſilence the diſcouery of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, til ſuch time as they ſaw them entred into the hollow vallies, and enuironed with high and craggy rockes full of woods, and that they were entangled on all ſides in the<note place="margin">Battell of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea againſt Feriſey.</note> thicke and huge forreſts. Then iſſuing out vpon them with great fury &amp; violence, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly and vnexpected, they preſented them ſelues to the enemy. There were of foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men about the number of one thouſand fiue hundred, beſides two thouſand horſe at the leaſt. But theſe were reſerued to a further and better peece of ſeruice. The Turkes (who had enough to doe, and were ſufficiently beaten with the diſcommodities and diſaduauntages of the place) were on all ſides aſſailed, both before, behinde, and in flanke, by the Infantery, who killed and ſlew them at their pleaſures. They notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding not forſaking their ranckes, but defending themſelues with great hardineſſe, as long as there was any hope of victory, did ſtoutly continue in the ſame place, where the enemy had firſt charged them. But the horſes did rather hurt and hinder then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite or ſuccour their maiſters, and were in the end the loſſe and ouerthrow of the riders. For (being as men beſieged) they receiued and tooke more wounds by far, then they could giue or inflict vppon their enemies. And yet when as all appearaunce and likelihood of eſcaping this daunger was cleane taken from them, euen then did they ſhew themſelues more valiant and hardy then euer: &amp; they maintained the fight with the greater obſtinacy, almoſt all of them keeping the ſelfſame place to the very death, where they had once ſet footing and taken poſſeſſion, whileſt they were aliue: Some few only being excepted, whom either the ſhameful deſire of life, or a more vrgent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution taken vpon the place (for they ſcorned to die ſuch a kinde of death, the deſire whereof was more fooliſh and contemptible, then honeſt or commendable) did make them to humble themſelues on their knees, and to lay down their armes, which made the conquerors to ſaue their liues and take them to mercy. There were of them taken priſoners 760. but of thoſe which were ſlaine, the number was much greater. Thus the Barbarians making haſt to the prey, became themſelues to be an eaſy prey to their<note place="margin">Victory of Scanderbeg a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Feriſey.</note> enemies giuing vnto the Chriſtians a ioyfull teſtimony of their miſconceited &amp; falſe imagined victory. <hi>Feriſey</hi> ſeeing the vantgard of his owne army encloſed &amp; ſurpriſed, and the enemy buſily fleſhing themſelues in their ſlaughter, &amp; plying themſelues vpon this occaſion, as hauing gotten a fit ſubiect for their glory, hee turned bridell with the reſidue of his troopes, and being ſmally mindfull, either of his Princes inſtructions, or of his owne naturall fiercenes, he was vtterly vnwilling in ſo ſodaine and vnloked for an accident, and in a place of ſuch diſaduauntage, to make any further triall (to his coſt perhappes) of a worſer Fortune: doubting both the danger and the number of the <q>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to be greater then he ſuppoſed. Hee therefore turned his backe to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and in his retire hee cried out aloft, that it was more commendable in an expert<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> Captaine to ſaue ſome, then to loſe all,</q> eſpecially in ſuch a place where (euen as dumbe beaſtes) they muſt giue their throates to the cutting. True it is that there be ſome, who write, that he was ſlaine in the fight by the handes of <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi> But the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the <hi>Albanois,</hi> did not ſuffer their retraite to bee altogether without bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhedde, but keeping continually in the taile of them as they fled, they did kill many of them which ſtragled and ſtayed behinde, and they preſſed vppon them hard, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing them continually, till ſuch time as they grewe to be ſomewhat wearyed, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:13368:52"/>
depriued rather of ſtrength, then of will and appetite to chaſe and follow them. Theſe matters being thus diſpatched, and the Turkes put to flight, without any great hurt of his owne companies, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> with all thoſe troopes which he had with him, did inuade the territory of the enemy, filling and ſatisfying the deſires of the ſouldiers with the ſweete contentment of prey and pillage.</p>
            <p>The misfortune of <hi>Feriſey</hi> was ſeconded with the like deſaſter &amp; miſhap of <hi>Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,</hi> no leſſe vnhappy &amp; vnfortunat.

Beſides, his thoughts affected nothing more (he being vtterly ignorant of his owne miſhap) then one day to ſee the fields of <hi>Epire,</hi> where he did hope to find ſome matter to execute his long wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deſired reuenge of ſo many outrages and iniuries both of old and lately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: in ſuch ſort, that ſome ſecret force and operation of the heauens, did ſeeme to draw on the fate of his old age, which (of it owne nature) was fearefull faint and time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous:<note place="margin">Sentence. Old age natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſaint and timerous.</note> but the troubles which were reported to be as then imminent from the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians, did not permit and ſuffer him, freely as then to diſcharge his rage and choller againſt the Epirots. The glorious old fellow with the like humour of wrath and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, did not for beare to reproch and menace <hi>Huniades,</hi> ſaying, that this was not the firſt time, that the tumults and troubles of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> had ſaued and preſerued the ſtate of <hi>Albany:</hi> neuertheleſſe, becauſe he could not ſuffer nor endure the bloud of his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ſo lately ſhed, nor that the bodies of ſo many valiant warriers, ſhould lie on the earth without any reuenge, and eſpecially becauſe he was perſwaded that the profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble example of the former, might keepe others hereafter from the like ſurpriſe, &amp; learn them to be wiſer: and for that the troupes of <hi>Feriſey</hi> ſeemed to haue bene vanquiſhed, not by any proweſſe of the Chriſtians, but onely by the diſaduantage of the place: he committed the care of this buſineſſe into the hands of <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> of whom afterwards<note place="margin">Muſtapha ſent againſt Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg with an Army of 15000. Turks.</note> he did often, (but not with any great good ſucceſſe) ſerue himſelfe in thoſe quarters. Him he commaunded to make a ſupply, and to fill vp the companies of <hi>Feriſey,</hi> and to encreaſe their numbers with a new ſtrength of 6000. horſe, he enioyned him more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, and expreſly charged him in any caſe not to enter neither more nor leſſe into the ſtreightes and paſſages of <hi>Epire,</hi> where the enemy held him ſelfe in ambuſhment, and where the perill was moſt to be redoubted, and that vppon no occaſion, nor for the hope of any good ſucceſſe whatſoeuer, he ſhould not hazard himſelf to the fight or force of the enemy: but that without any more adoe, he ſhould onely waſt and ſpoile their borders, and to hold him ſelfe contented with this glorie, that the trees and the fieldes of the <hi>Albanois,</hi> had in ſome ſort felt the force and violence of his victorious and conquering ſword: and that their countrey was burnt, waſted, and conſumed by the fire. Theſe and ſuch like goodlie admonitions, did the <hi>Sultan</hi> giue to <hi>Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,</hi> as though a man could preſcribe vnto the hearers, what they hadde to doe when their armors are once put vpon their backes. Notwithſtanding when the time came that this ſhould be put in execution, the carefull diligence of the Captaine did not let paſſe or neglect any one point of this charge which had bene giuen him: but as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſerued, hee added to the ſame many good reſpectes, after hee came to conſider the nature of the countrey, and to haue a view of the ſituation of the place. For
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:13368:53"/>
ſcarcely had he diſplaied his enſignes within the confines of the chriſtians, but for bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to march on with his Campe at large, through the open field, he firſt of all ſent forth three hundred horſe to beat ouer the plaine champion, and to diſcouer farre and neare all the paſſages, and to ſound the couerts and ſecret places which might ſerue for ambuſhment; enioyning them, that if they ſaw any likelyhood of daunger from the enemy, they ſhould ſpeedily retire themſelues to the body of their forces, or elſe draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them on by litle and litle, they ſhould ſuffer them to preſſe and follow hard vppon them, till they were trained neare to the place appointed for their retraite. In ſo doing they ſhould be ſure to deale ſafely, and they might happe to entrappe the wily foxe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entiſed ſo ſmoothly to the ſnare: both for that his forces being the weaker, they ſhould haue no cauſe to feare and redoubt them, and becauſe they had litle reaſon to thinke, that albeit his numbers were at the greateſt, yet in ſo ſodaine an occaſion, hee ſhould be able to ſtirre abroade with any great ſtore of forces. Now when theſe skoutes had well and diligently ſurueyed all quarters, and hadde vppon their returne made report, that all was ſafe and ſure; the Captaine Turke retayning with himſelfe<note place="margin">Muſtapha en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skonſeth his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dony.</note> foure thouſand horſe, enskonſed and fortified the place (where he meant to abide) in forme of a Campe, both with large rampiers and trenches, and with men of an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and good courage, partly thereby to aſſure the pillage, and partly to preuent and withſtand all the hazards and chaunces of variable and vnconſtant Fortune. A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſmall height or mount of ground riſing, and mounting it ſelfe in manner of a little hill, did make their fort ſomewhat the more defencible, and leſſe acceſſible for the enemy. Hauing taken this order for his campe, he placed ſome for ſecrete ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelles and watches vppon the tops of certaine high mountaines, with certaine tokens &amp; ſignals to giue notice of the comming of the enemy. This done, the reſt of his horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men he licenſed to the ſpoile, abandoning the countrey to their greedy auarice &amp; cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, which by their continuall bloudy roades and inuaſions, brought all things to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible ruine and deſtruction. But he had firſt giuen them in charge, that whoſoeuer did not at the firſt ſound of the trumpet, and when the retrait ſhould be ſounded, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently retire himſelfe within the campe, he ſhould be reputed as an enemy. Now was that goodly and pleaſant country harried, ſpoiled, and layd waſt: now were the trees and plants rooted vp and deſtroied, by the rage and ſword of the Barbarians: the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows &amp; paſtures did ſeem (as it were) to bewail and lament: &amp; the flames of the towns and villages (which were openly ſeene fired and burning euery where on all ſides, did ſeeme to cry and call for ſome to work their reuenge. Al the ſeed corne in the ground being beaten downe and troden vnder foote, with the trampling of their horſes, (for it was in Autumne) the innocent and harmles earth did now make ſhew, that it ſhould defraud the poore and vnfortunate labourer of his pains and trauell. Nothing was left free or vntouched which the ſword or fire could conſume or deſtroy: of moueables &amp; cattels of ſmall value, and litle reckonning which belonged to the poore people, there was good ſtore and plenty to be found, but of men and inhabitants very few or none: by reaſon that the enemies were their next neighbours, ſmall was the number of them that remained in the countrey villages, and the moſt part of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with their wiues, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, &amp; all their families, and with the chiefe &amp; choiſeſt of their ſubſtance, were ſhifted and fled away into the next walled townes, and ſtrong fenced holdes.</p>

            <p>I was wont (my companions and copartners in Armes) to giue counſell, and to<note place="margin">Oration of Scanderbeg to his ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how to aſſaile Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtapha.</note>

We were giuen to vnderſtand, that the Turkes as robbers and free-booters without any order or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, without any regard, did wander vp and downe the fields, flying hither and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as men that did feare any thing more then our comming. For this cauſe by my perſwaſion and procurement, &amp; vnder my conduct, here are you come with this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable intent and purpoſe, to inuade and ſet vpon them with your forces: it is not needful that I tell you what new counſels and directions the happy &amp; oportune com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of this man hath brought vs: you haue heard himſelf recount, what the enemie doth, &amp; how they do demeane the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues.

For this cauſe in my opinion it is requiſit, that you carrie yourſelues more conſiderately with a better deliberation againſt your enemies, then (it ſeemeth) you were determined.

For, the reſidue of theſe free-booters (ſome of them being excluded and ſeparated from the ſuccours of their companions, and others of them being on all ſides beſieged by your forces) they will be at your mercie, either aliue or dead, as your ſelues ſhal pleaſe to diſpoſe of them.

            <p>This counſell of the Generall was vniuerſally liked and allowed, and it was put in execution and followed with the conſent of all the ſoldiers. The troupes therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing marſhalled and ordered according to the Art and skil of armes, they were drawne forth of the ſecret and cloſe vallies into the open and plaine fields, &amp; they did now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to the wards &amp; ſcouts of the Turks: who from the tops of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, by the fiers mounting vp on high, did giue notice of their comming to thoſe within the fortreſſe. Then was heard the ſound &amp; noiſe of the trumpets, to the great griefe of thoſe men of armes, who were diſperſed abroad in the champion, and were buſied in ſpoyling and pilling of the countrey. Many of them retired vppon the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and were receiued within the trenches, before that our men could get neare them, and others as they were making haſt to enter, were ſore troubled and terrified. The noiſe and cry of the enemies ſoldiers, ſounding and fearing them, with the name of <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi> Many (whom the ſodaine and ſpeedy comming of the <hi>Albanois,</hi> did finde without at the entry of the Fort) were excluded and ſhut out. And being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with the ſpoile and prey of the countrey, they found them ſelues likewiſe charged with their enemies. On all ſides was the aſſault giuen to the trenches, and at<note place="margin">Scanderbeg aſſaileth the Turkes within their fort and trenches.</note> the firſt charge (in a manner) their cariages and baggage, which they hadde made as a Barricado to their fort, and the Targatiers that guarded the place, were ouerthrowen and caſt downe, with an exceeding great noiſe and confuſion, both of thoſe that were excluded, &amp; of our men, who ſtriued pell mell to enter with them. All of them made way indifferently and alike, and all places were full of enemies mixt together. The preſſe was ſo great, and the place ſo ſtraight, that there was no vſe of dartes nor yet of ſhot. The fight was more hand to hand, and they found it more aduauntage to vſe the ſword, and certaine Maſes of iron (a ſhort kinde of weapon which the Turkes did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vſe in battell.) It was a ſtrange kinde of fight, to ſee the Turks fighting with their <q>ſwords in one hand, and their fatall booty in the other.

The Chriſtians encreaſing ſtill in fury and fierceneſſe, did eagerly preſſe vppon them more and more, and without intermiſſion,</q> did on al parts put them to vtterance, filling the whole place with feare and ſlaughter, till ſuch time as <hi>Muſtapha</hi> (who kept in the ſafeſt place of his Campe, and did performe

rather the part of an encorager the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a ſoldier) ſeeing no hope of ſafetie left by armes, and being conſtrained to yeeld to his misfortune, he ſhifted himſelfe from the danger<note place="margin">Victorie of Scanderbeg a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Musta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha.</note> by the ſwiftnes of his horſe, at one of the ports of his camp which was fartheſt off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his enemies. Immediatly hereupon the conflict began to be more moderate and leſſe cruell, with leſſe ſlaughter &amp; bloudſhed, by reaſon that ſome caſting away their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons did ſubmit themſelues to the Chriſtians, &amp; the reſidue partaking in the neceſſitie of their Captaine, did ſhift for their liues with quicke ſpurring of their horſes. Manie (whom the earneſt deſire of their profit had drawne far from their fort) miſdoubting the ill ſucceſſe of their companions, by the cries and noiſe of the enemie, which they heard a far off, did endeuor to ſaue themſelues by flying: but there was ſcant any one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that eſcaped: for diuerſe great troups of archers lay in waite vpon the paſſages, who annoying the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the abundance of their arrows, did by that meanes diſcharge their anger vpon them. Some hold that the whole power of the Turkes (excepting <hi>Muſtapha</hi> and a few of the principall, who were beſt mounted) was ſlaine in that bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell. But in my opinion they come nigheſt to the troth, who write, that there were ſlaine about 5000. men, but a far leſſer number taken priſoners, which amounted not at the moſt to aboue 300. and the moſt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mightily disfigured or maimed by their many and grieuous wounds: becauſe that the ſoldiers being incredibly incenſed vpon the ſight of the pillage gotten fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their fellowes, and the extreme ſpoile &amp; deſolation of their countrey, were caried away &amp; moued to vſe the greater furie and crueltie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. Of the victors there were wanting but 20. horſemen, and 50. foote, who were rather ouerrun with the horſes then ſlaine by the ſword of the enemy. Thus the Albanois being now poſſeſſed of the campe, the enſignes, the baggage, &amp; the cariages of their enemies, they inuaded alſo and ouerrun their territories: where, with a prize and bootie more aſſured and of better certaintie, they recompenced that loſſe &amp; dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage which had bene receiued by the Turkes, with a greater vſurie and aduantage.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time that theſe things were ſo happily atchieued againſt the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,<note place="margin">Lech or Luke Zacharie Lord of the towne of Dayna vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the riuer of Drinon in Albanie.</note> it is reported that <hi>Lech Zacharie</hi> (of whom we haue before made ſome mention) was vnfortunately murthered by <hi>Lech Ducagin</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Paul.</hi> This man was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage who made himſelfe famous through the happie and proſperous ſucceſſe of his wicked actions, yet borne of a father who was a good man, and moſt vertuous.

For theſe two Princes being next neighbours each to other, and <hi>Ducagin</hi> perceiuing the other to be without iſſue, &amp; hauing no hope of any lawfull heires, he thought belike that the ſucceſſion of his eſtate, would eaſily fall &amp; eſcheate to him that could firſt and ſooneſt ſeize vpon it:</q> whereupon he both depriued him of his life, and at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant he iniuriouſly vſurped a great part of his ſigniory. Yet could he not abſolutely &amp; fully accompliſh his deuilliſh intent, which he had ſo wickedly begun and attempted. For the Daynians (who inhabited the capitall towne &amp; chiefe fortreſſe of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey) by their conſent, faith and fidelitie (the onely meane wherein they could make ſhew therof) did teſtifie their loue and affection which they bare to their Prince. And whereas the Ladie <hi>Boſſa</hi> the mother of him that was ſlaine, being very old and aged, was not a litle penſiue and ſorowfull in that ſhe had ſuruiued her ſonne, they defended<note place="margin">He meaneth the Gouernour of Scutary or Scodra.</note> her eſtate with great loyalty, till ſuch time as ſhe (induced thereunto by the counſell and practiſe of others, and by the perſwaſion of her friends) or imagining that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie of her aged yeares, and the weake ſpirit of a woman was not ſufficient to go through with ſo great a charge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eſpecially the ſtate of her affairs being ſo troubleſome

            <p>See now how fortune prepared her ſelf to make <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> famous &amp; renowmed on the one ſide by the armes and forces of <hi>Italie,</hi> in that ſhe bred a iarre betweene him and the Venetians: and on the other ſide by <hi>Myſtapha,</hi> who in the preſence of <hi>Amurath</hi> as an vpright iudge (although enuious againſt his enemy) with a great diſcourſe and abundance of good words (both to couer his owne misfortune, &amp; to excuſe the fault of his companions) did highly extoll the inuincible proweſſe of this perſonage, and his incomparable experience in the Art militarie: oftentimes repeating that it was <q>needfull to prouide other maner of forces, and with a more mightie kind of warre to<note place="margin">Muſtapha excuſeth his ouerthrow vnto Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath.</note> tame his furie and fierceneſſe: that this was not the way to ſound the mind, &amp; to try the ſtirring thoughts of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> by ſuch rodes and inuaſions, and by the ſpoyling and waſting of the fields: that theſe were meanes rather to incenſe and animate the harts of the Albanois (who were a nation of a braue nature, and of a high corage:) that theſe ambuſhments and wiles of warre were not to preuaile againſt him that was his crafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter in ſuch ſubtilties, but that they would always redound to their ruine &amp; confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and more then that, by the courſe and cuſtome of ſo many daily victories, by litle and litle they ſhould ingender a contempt of the name &amp; maieſty of <hi>Ottoman</hi> among the Chriſtians: that (in his opinion) the beſt way was either altogether to abſtaine &amp; giue ouer fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> making war vpon him, or elſe, to frame themſelues to follow the wars with ſo full reſolution, that they might at once and without any more a do, vanquiſh and ſubdue this enemie, and ſo make a finall end &amp; concluſion of the warre of <hi>Albany.</hi>

            <p>Theſe reaſons and allegations of the Baſſa (though the <hi>Sultan</hi> did take ſmall pleaſure in the praiſes of his aduerſary) could not ſeeme to proceed of puſillanimity or want of corage, ſeeing he had before his eies the like misfortunes of all thoſe, whom he had at any time ſent and emploied againſt <hi>Caſtriot.</hi> Somtimes <hi>Haly</hi> Baſſa, and ſomtimes <hi>Feri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi> (who of all others was leaſt faulty) did put him in minde of their calamities, more ſingular and notorious, &amp; they did excuſe vnto their Prince <hi>Amurath,</hi> the vnfortunat vertue of <hi>Muſtapha.</hi> Wherefore he alſo changing his mind (a common &amp; vſual thing<note place="margin">Sentence.

being reported at one &amp; the ſame inſtant to <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> made him diuerſly diſtracted in his thoughtes and cogitations, and did greatly perplexe his minde. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Barbarian (with whom it was an ordinarie matter to be vanquiſhed) did not ſo much trouble him, but the horrible accident of that Prince his ſingular friend: and his end no leſſe cruell then lamentable, did ſo oppreſſe his heart with grief, that it was thought it would go neare to kill him. Beſides this, his ſorow was much aggrauated when he heard of the determination of the Lady <hi>Boſſa,</hi> and that the Venetians had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken her cauſe, and made it their owne proper quarrell: for true it was, that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors of the places next adioyning had fortified all of them, &amp; principally the town of <hi>Dayna,</hi> with ſtrong and great garriſons.

For it was euident &amp; apparant, that there was a former compact paſt betweene him &amp; <hi>Zachary,</hi> that he that was the ſuruiuer of them twaine, ſhould be the others ſucceſſor, and enioy his dominions: &amp; this their agreement was confirmed by a ſolemne oth betweene them: what the right of law was in that caſe, either for the one or the other, I leaue to the lawyers to debate it, &amp; true it may be, that the diuine power by the fortune of the warre did equally deuide their controuerſie. But here in the meane time may alſo good Chriſtianlike minds ſee the fruits &amp; effects of ambition and auarice.

But now ſeeing that he refuſed the combat, wherby he was out of all hope either of doing of any exploit, or of any meanes to ſurprize or circumue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t him: he there left all thoſe forces which he had with him vpon the borders of the enemy, to preuent all new occaſions of tumults, and to repreſſe the inſolencie of the Turks: &amp; himſelf bending all his thoughts to the preparation of the war of <hi>Daina,</hi> with a very ſmall company attending him, tooke his iorney preſently towards <hi>Croy.</hi> There (knowing that the deciding of this debate was not likely to be otherwiſe then by force of armes) he ſpeedily commanded a publike leuie of ſoldiers: and himſelf riding all ouer the prouince with ſome of his moſt nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; ancienteſt Captaines, for the raiſing of men, he aſſembled a mighty armie.

The reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue (hauing prouided for all occaſions) hee left to hold the ſiege before <hi>Dayna.</hi> The which (notwithſtanding the rumour of the enemies approach) he determined notto leaue or to abandon. Thus the vndaunted Chiefrain by his ſingular prudence, hauing ſeperated his forces into 3. partes, did thereby occaſion his aduerſaries, through a vaine &amp; fooliſh kind of hope, to triumph ouer him, and to grow the more in heart and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For the <hi>Daynia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> ſeeing <hi>Caſtriot</hi> to be abſent, did think now that they were no longer beſieged, for their courts of guard at the portes, were not ſo ſtrong as was vſuall, but they grew to be neglected, the wals were not ſo well manned: and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes might the ſouldiours of the enemy without, ioyntly with the citizens with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, haue entred into their gates which were diuerſe times left open. To be briefe, they growing, in a maner careles of al things, only the imminent danger of famine did ſeem to perplexe them, which neither was to be conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned by their audacity, nor auoided by their valor and magnanimity. Notwithſtanding the honor &amp; reputation of their faith which they had once paſſed &amp; promiſed, did aſſure their corages, &amp; did bind them to endure the rigor of all difficulties. Beſides the aduertiſements touching their confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats (who aduanced them ſelues with great iourneis to mitigate theſe miſchieues &amp; to deliuer them from this miſery) did greatly comfort their afflicted ſpirits, &amp; made them to conceiue an aſſured hope of deliuerance. Moreouer perſwading themſelues that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriot</hi> was not able to make head againſt ſo great a puiſſance, they did look euery hour in great care and expectation to ſee ſome meſſenger, and to heare ſome certaine newes of the victory (which in their opinion they did promiſe vnto their owne fancies.)

Faine would he haue aſſailed the garriſon there left vpon the borders, and willingly would he haue made a ſacrifice to the iuſt wrath of his Prince, and to his owne am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of thoſe ſouldiers, whom he ſuppoſed to be weakened by the abſence of their Chieftaine, and the reſt of their companions. He had an infinite deſire to be made a partner with the Venetians in this glorie and triumph ouer his deadly enemie: and he was more intentiue to the preſent aduantage and opportunitie, then mindful of the charge and commaundement of his Soueraigne. But on the other ſide, the ſeueritie of <hi>Ottoman,</hi> and the ſundrie examples of others, (whoſe diſobedience had bene moſt grieuouſly puniſhed) did with hold &amp; ſtay his doubtfull and variable mind.

The very eies of the ſouldiers ſeemed to flame with fury, &amp; on either ſide was heard a mighty noiſe (an argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of their wrath and choller). Then were praiers, vowes, and ſhewes of deuotion in the mouthes of the leaders, &amp; alſo of the ſouldiers, and euery man ſhewed himſelfe a good Chriſtian and recommended himſelfe vnto God.

The former were encouraged through their merits &amp; deſerts in ſo many valiant acts &amp; exploits daily atchieued vpon the Barbarians, &amp; through the remembrance of their honor &amp; renowne lately gotten vpon <hi>Muſtapha:</hi> the latter though they were wel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for all things needfull for a greater warre, and though they might (not without good cauſe) promiſe vnto themſelues the hope of victorie, yet (if they ſhould happen to haue the worſt) they were not for all that ſuch as would be diſmaied or ſtoupe to the fortune of the enemy: for euery man knew the vnuanquiſhed power of the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, &amp; that they were able continually to ſupply new &amp; greater forces to maintaine the quarrell, &amp; to bring the warre to a better iſſue: in ſuch ſort that this enterpriſe of <hi>Dayna</hi> was like to be the confuſion of the Duke of <hi>Albany.</hi> Yet did the hard &amp; miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eſtate of the beſieged, greatly perplex them, becauſe they were certified that there remained a ſtrong power before the city.

An example hereof (my good friends) is here repreſented vnto vs in this our enemie, no leſſe proud then preſumptuous: who by his vnhappy audacity &amp; his exceſſiue fortune is now growen to this point, that he dareth to raiſe warre vpon warre, and to moleſt thoſe Princes of whom (if he will conſider the benefits he hath receiued) there is not any one thing, excepting his temeritie, but he may attribute it vnto them wholly. But the good hap of his affaires hath now ſo peruerted his ſenſes, that it behooueth vs not onely at this time to take armes publiquely, but in priuate alſo to hate him mortally. Behold &amp; turne aſide your eies to the pitifull eſtate of the Dainians, to the intent the iuſt wrath of their iniurie, &amp; the honeſt care of your friends, may animate your cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.

For (to omit other matters) can there be any greater temeritie then this? can there be any folly more notable then by ſo leud an example to debarre men fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the libertie of protecting of others in the right of their own goods &amp; poſſeſſions? And by meanes thereof moſt wickedly to purchaſe to him ſelfe al that he can ſeize vpon, &amp; vnder this vaine pretence of I know not what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pact &amp; agreement, to excuſe his greedie deſire of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand: abrogating by this meanes, and taking away from men all the rights of their libertie? His ambitious mind is enraged that the Venetians ſhould be preferred before him by the Dainians: &amp; he impugneth the voluntarie mind of the mother in the diſpoſition of the heritage of her own ſonne deceaſed: but you may ſee how the malladie &amp; infirmitie of his owne mind, and the vehemency of his deſpight hath ſo blinded and inueigled him, that being tranſported with enuie, he runneth headlong to his own deſtruction: for he could not endure to put off the care of this warre, till ſuch time, as (hauing chaſed away this enemie the

Turke, who is daily at his dores) he might haue bin the better able to vnite all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces &amp; to haue come with al his whole power to execute his hatred againſt the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians: neither hath he bin ſo well aduiſed as to ioyne battell againſt vs with any great forces, though it be in ſight of the towne beſieged. But he (this expert warrior) hath ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated his forces here and there, ſhewing himſelf therin a more vpright iudge to you, then to himſelf, &amp; to further your cauſe more then his own. And whilſt that the ſiege of <hi>Dayna</hi> on the one ſide, &amp; the care &amp; doubt of <hi>Muſtapha</hi> on the other, doth not ſuffer his mind to enioy any reſt or quietnes, he hath reſerued this army not as a fit enemie able to encounter with you, but as a ſacrifice rather to be ſlaughtered by you.

For nothing can be more reprochfull to him that is nobly minded, neither can anie thing be more repugnant to the dignitie and maieſtie of a Prince, then to ſuffer by timorouſneſſe and puſilanimitie, his right to be vſurped by an other: and to holde (as a man would ſay) his finger vnder his girdle, when he knoweth his right is not to be had, but by

force of armes. There is none of you but knoweth the hartie amitie and the inwarde conuerſation which was euer betweene me and the Seignior <hi>Lech Zacharie,</hi> whoſe death (being no leſſe cruell then grieuous) hath ſtirred on all parts ſo many troubles, and that he and I (induced thereunto by other mutuall affection) did with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſet downe this as a lawe inuiolable, that which ſoeuer of vs two ſhould firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe without iſſue, ſhould be ſeized (by the compact and the right of ſuruiuorſhip) of the other his heritage &amp; dominions. Now the Venetians haue gotten his lands, and I am left heire only of his teares to lament the iniquity of his fortune. Did not I by this agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hazard the renouncing of my own patrimony, if my accident (as the danger of death is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to all men) had taken me firſt away out of this life? I haue no reaſon therefore, neither am I determined to giue ouer the warre, except (God being againſt me) I be put to the worſt, or that I be inueſted in the quiet poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Dayna:</hi> for none but fooles can blame me for this war, whereunto ſo good reaſon, &amp; ſo honeſt a cauſe doth perſwade me.

True it is, we do with a ſtreight ſiege preſſe the towne &amp; countrie of our owne kinſmen, of our owne bloud &amp; alliance; but yet we do it not with ſo ill an intention as they imagine, neither are we lead thereunto, either vpon a greedie deſire of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund &amp; Empire, or delight of murther and bloudſhed: but only to wring that citie out of the hands of our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and to draw the vngratefull inhabitants (at the leaſt) to a confeſſion &amp; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of their error and obſtinacie. We are come to fight with the enemie, who hath firſt prouoked vs by diuers acts of hoſtilitie. Reſolue you therefore in your cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage with an aſſured &amp; honeſt reſolution to maintaine your honor and reputation. It may ſeeme that the ſouereignty of <hi>Dayna</hi> being propounded for the reward of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror ſhould giue ſufficient &amp; ample occaſion to take armes: but let not (I pray you) any ſuch conceipt enter into your thoughts, for theſe are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly the baites to allure ambitious minds, &amp; they are entiſements of the baſe popular &amp; vulgar ſort. The only deſire of praiſe and commendation is ſufficient to animate &amp; ſtirre on thoſe which are valiant: and yet if you obtain this daies victory, al ſhal be yours without controuerſie. For the enemie being chaſed away, and the beſieged ſeeing their hope to be fruſtrate which they had in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions, &amp; being preſſed with extreame famine, they will ſoone open their gates to receiue you in as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>querors. As touching the victory, I need not ſay any thing vnto you, who haue always accuſtomed to be victors: if they againſt who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you are now to make proofe of your valure be a new enemy, ſo is it a new kind of glory that doth now attend you. Doe the Venetians ſurpaſſe you in number? be it: the honor which you haue purchaſed in ſo many battels, where you haue alwaies bin the leſſer number, hath euer heretofore made you famous: the free and gentle heart doth diſdain to ouercome when euery mans deuoire cannot be ſeene, &amp; where he can not purchaſe particular praiſe and commendation: againe, what aduantage haue they in that their number is greater then ours? Seeing as there is amongſt them diuerſitie of languages, variety of habits, &amp; a different vſe in armes: ſo is there as great diuerſity and diſagreement in their mindes and courages: and as their army is compounded of many and ſundrie Nations, as Sclauonians, Italians, Albaneezes: ſo are they diuerſe in faſhions, and with a confuſed kinde of ignorance followe vnder one and the ſame colours: their crie and noyſe in the fight will be of diuerſe and ſundrie ſounds, and much leſſe auaileable will be the encouragements of their leaders. March on there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (my good ſouldiers) and in the very entrie and beginning of the battell, valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe you beate backe, repulſe, and diſperſe theſe enemies, who are better diſpoſed to

the flight, then to fight: and ſee that you doe nowe renewe by the honour of this dayes iourney, the glorious renowne of ſo manie trophees and victories which you haue heretofore gotten and obtained vppon the Turkes. Neuertheleſſe I would not that you ſhould carie your ſelues towardes theſe as againſt other enemies: but rather that you vſe more moderation and leſſe choller, and that being inclined to mercie and clemencie, you doe labour rather to haue them all priſoners, then to haue them ſlaughtered in the fieldes. In anie caſe doe you not, either through intemperate fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of warre, or the heate of your anger and indignation, pollute and defile your vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious handes with the bloud of thoſe, who ſhall yeelde and render themſelues to your mercies. For it is not with Barbarous, fierce, and ſauage Nations that we haue now to deale, but with Chriſtians, againſt whom we are to contende according to the rights and lawes of armes, with equitie and iuſtice, and onely to repulſe iniuſtice, and to liue in reſt and quietneſſe.</q>

            <p>The great modeſtie that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> made ſhew of in this his ſpeech, did the more<note place="margin">The affection of the ſouldiers of Scanderbeg after his ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> vehemently animate the minds of his ſouldiers, and made them the more affectionate vnto him: for that (being a matter rare and ſeldome ſeene) he did in the ſame bewray himſelfe to be both reſpectiue of their good, and no leſſe carefull for the enemie. For this cauſe, flocking about their Prince, they praiſed &amp; applauded his counſell, ech of them affirming: that they were readie to make proofe of their reſolution, and to offer themſelues to all hazarde and fortune of battell, not for the defence onely, but for the increaſe alſo and augmentation of his renowme and glorie: that the armes of the Venetians were not ſo to be redoubted: that their opinion in attributing much vnto them, ſhould make them in the meane while, to forget their owne dutie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoire: that if the diſhonour and ignominie, offered by the Danians, ſhould by their faintneſſe and ſlouthfulneſſe remaine vnpuniſhed, the iniurie would be common to all his ſubiectes: and that it was not for their honour now to be diſcouraged, in the middeſt of ſo great broyles, and at this time wherien they were buſied and ſurchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the weight and burthen of a double warre: that men ſhould not be able to doe any thing worthie of honour and commendation, if euerie idle conſultation, ſhould reſtraine and ſuppreſſe the vehemencie of their courages: and if they ſhould examine euerie particular with a kinde of blockiſh and ſlouthfull deliberation, that the hardie man and he that is valiant ought to aduenture himſelfe, and to march on reſolutely, and to beare off all daungers with head and ſhoulders: and that it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not him to looke into matters with too much curioſitie, to augment his owne feare, nor by a ſtrict examination of things, to interprete and reueale vnto men, thoſe miſchiefes which are hidden from them: that many high and difficult affaires haue beene ſurmounted and ouercome by the furie of the reſolute ſouldier, and by the fierceneſſe of his courage once ſtirred and enflamed: whereas a mind free and quietly diſpoſed would not dare to aduenture vpon them; that a man ought alſo to relie and caſt his care wholly vpon God, who aſſiſteth continually in the warre that partie whoſe cauſe and quarrell is iuſt and rightful. And neuertheleſſe if their ſafety did only depend vpon their own valure, yet the ſtate of <hi>Albany</hi> ſhould be ſufficiently defended &amp; protected, only by the faith &amp; mutuall amity of her owne peoples. Moreouer that <hi>Amurath</hi> was withheld &amp; kept doing by the warre of <hi>Hungary,</hi> &amp; that they knew the power &amp; puiſſance of the Venetians to be great: but withall they were not ignorant, that the Italians, the farther they are drawn fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> home, the more ſlowly do they march on, &amp; proceed the more vnwillingly. Theſe with many ſuch like ſpeches were vttered confuſedly amongſt the whole troupe of ſouldiers according to euery mans diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: with this intent and purpoſe alſo, that their Prince (hearing their deuiſes) might
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:13368:59"/>
take the better notice of their good willes and affection, and might ſhewe them the better countenance: he (prayſing and extolling the affection of euery of them) ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king aloud vnto them in manner of ieſting and merriment, ſmiling he tolde them, that nature was much to blame in that ſhe had not placed theſe noble and generous ſpirits of the <hi>Albanois,</hi> in a higher and better fortune.</p>
            <p>This done, <hi>Caſtriot</hi> cauſed his ſouldiers to go and refreſh themſelues: and then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taken ſome repaſt, and all matters being throughly prouided for, about midday, with a mind cheerefull and confident, he drewe forth his troupes into the field. The archers and others which were lightly armed, he placed in the front before the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes:<note place="margin">Order of the armie of the Albanoys.</note> then (with the corſlets and thoſe whoſe armes were more weightie) he made the two wings, appointing vnto each of them 2000. horſe: to <hi>Tanuſee</hi> was giuen the middle battell, wherein likewiſe amongeſt the men at armes were mingled cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine foot men. As touching the rereward or for any ſupplies, he tooke no care at all, becauſe he had determined to make it knowen that he accounted the victory ſure his own: and that the enemie was much more eaſie to be vanquiſhed, then the Venetians did ſeeme to make ſhew of, either by the aſſurance of their countenances or by their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and forwardneſſe at the firſt charge. As little regard did he take to the garding of his campe, for he left the ſame all emptie, and with ſo fewe to defende it, that hardly could he haue held it againſt the meaneſt companie of any theeues or robbers. This ſo reſolute an aſſurance of this Chiefetaine could not haue beene exempted from the blame of temeritie, were it not that he had appointed the ſtrength and force of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traite in thoſe companies which held the ſiege before <hi>Dayna:</hi> for if contrarie to his expectation he had ſeene the enemy to haue had the better, his purpoſe was to retire thither to that campe, becauſe neither the number of his ſouldiers, nor the ſituation and nature of the place, did profite him to fortifie his owne campe: yet in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was this a counſell farre vnworthie of the wiſedome and the prudent inuention of ſo great a Captaine: ſeeing that if his troupes had happened to haue beene broken, their flight in this manner had bene much more dangerous and pernicious, then their courage and obſtinacie in the fight could haue wrought their aſſurance. For the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians being victorious and purſuing them in the taile, and the paſſage of the riuer <hi>Drynon</hi> being made more difficult in ſo great an affray, and ſo confuſed a tumult, muſt needes haue deſtroied and ſwallowed the moſt of them that remained: wherfore the truth is, and we muſt needes confeſſe, that the opinion of his owne vertue not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to be vanquiſhed, did make him to place his hope in himſelfe onely. The Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians<note place="margin">Order of the armie of the Venetians.</note> in the ſame manner likewiſe did affront their enſignes with their pykes, who were Italians, and their wings they diſpoſed in the ſame order as did the Albanians. <hi>Daniell</hi> himſelfe tooke the charge of the right wing, which he enuironned with a ſtrong guard, or garriſon of Sclauonians, of which he had made choiſe of purpoſe. Certaine men at armes Italians were placed in the head, and in the rereward of this battallion. <hi>Colla Humoy</hi> of <hi>Scutarie,</hi> who was the ſeconde man, and next to the<note place="margin">Colla Humoy.</note> Generall in this armie, had the leading of the left wing, and being accompanied with his owne citizens, did make head againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and his ſouldiers the Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brians. <hi>Andrewe</hi> his brother and <hi>Symon Volcathagne</hi> had the guiding of the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle<note place="margin">Volcathagne.</note> battell. In briefe, all the rankes were filled indifferently with ſouldiers of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie ſortes, ſeruing rather for an hinderance and impediment, then for anie defence or good aſſurance. The Venetians were litle leſſe then thirteene thouſand men, and<note place="margin">The battell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians and Scanderbeg.</note> with this number was this battell foughten. The fight was begunne by their pyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who at their firſt encounter were repulſed by the archers: but when they once came to approach and ioyne neere ech to other, and that the vſe of their arrowes did
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:13368:59"/>
ſerue to little purpoſe: the Targatyers, couering them ſelues with their targets and the reſidue of thoſe which were light armed, came to the ſword and fought with the enemy hand to hand. In the meane time <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> couering the Archers with his troupe of horſes, and cauſing them a little to retire them ſelues, gaue them the meanes to vſe againe their bowes more conueniently. The Pike men for that they were ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly armed with good and ſtrong corſelets, had aduentured them ſelues the more hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and came to aſſault the enemy the more cruelly, whereby they put their fellowes in good hope of victorie. There began the wings to ioyne on both ſides with high &amp; mighty cries, which madethe very aire to reſound againe: The <hi>Albanois</hi> exceeded the other in number and goodneſſe of their horſe, yet was the place indifferent to them both, and no more for the vantage of the one, then of the other: for the place where this field was foughten, was in the middeſt of a goodly large plaine and cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, and neare adioyning to the riuer of <hi>Drynon.</hi> The Venetians being for a while equall to the enemy rather in forces then in courage, did for a long time maintaine the fight about their Generall with variable and doubtfull fortune, till ſuch time as the Prince of <hi>Albanie</hi> and certaine horſe with him, charging them in the middeſt did breake through the battell, by meanes wherof (many being wounded and great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of them being diſperſed and diſordered) all hope of the victorie had bene taken from the Venetians, had it not bene for the Illirians: who rallying them ſelues on all ſides, and trouping together in groſſe (as the agillitie and quickneſſe of that nation is ſingular) they made head againe againſt the enemy, and with a greater ſtrength did reaſſure the corps du Garde of the Venetian Generall, valiantly keeping of the enemy; yet, ſo as they ſeemed rather to ſtand vpon their defence then any way to offend their aduerſarie. The mayne battels on both ſides ſtood ſtill all this while and kept their ground, ſeeming rather to take a view then to entermeddle in the fight, ſo long as the wings or points being in fight did with doubtfull euent encounter each other. But aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoone as <hi>Tophia</hi> ſaw the right wing of the enemy hardly beſtead, (he taking courage by the former example of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi>) with a troupe of his beſt horſemen, and part of the infanterie, preſently charged vpon the middeſt of the left wing of the enemy, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them alſo into a new feare and confuſion. For the Illirians (who were placed in the front to beare the ſhocke of the enemy,) were not able to endure the charge, but made preſently to the right wing, and there ſtood vpon their owne defence, betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their companions on the one ſide, whom they had forſaken: and on the other ſide, they brought by their comming the greater difficultie vnto <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> who was there ſtriuing and inforcing him ſelfe to breake through the corps du Gard of the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirians. The like alſo did their footemen after their departure, for being not able to make their partie good againſt the <hi>Albanois</hi> horſemen; they ſcattered them ſelues here and there, and hauing their beſt aſſurance in their legges, they made them the meanes of their ſafety: which was the occaſion alſo that the horſemen of <hi>Scutarie,</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left naked &amp; open to the enemy) ſaw them ſelues ſodainly diſabled &amp; broken by the <hi>Albanois:</hi> for both their leaders and many others were taken priſoners, who being abandoned and forſaken of their footemen, and deſpairing of ſafety by hauing any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther recourſe to armes, did yeeld them ſelues to the diſpoſition of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: this made the other companies alſo greatly to feare, leaſt that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing once broken through that battell of the Illirians) which he had already charged, ſhould afterwarde charge alſo the backe of the wings, and ſo encloſing them on all ſides might preſſe them the more furiouſly.</p>
            <p>But the ſucceſſe of the vanquiſhers fell not out according to the fearefull <q>imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the vanquiſhed (ſo mightily doth proſperity oftentimes dull the minds of men.)</q>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:13368:60"/>
For the leaders when they ſaw themſelues to haue this aduantage, tooke no greater regard of any other thing, but held themſelues contented, that they could preſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their ſouldiers, as it were in ſhewe and triumph, their enemies bounden and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue. <hi>Caſtriot</hi> likewiſe not regarding the common ſouldiers, but diſdaining as it were the bloud of the inferiour and priuate ſort, did wholly enforce himſelfe to enterpriſe vpon the Generall, but a great and ſtrong troupe of horſe did hinder him from appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching neere him, and by that meanes diſappointed him of his purpoſe. The fight thus continuing on all handes, <hi>Moſes</hi> (who had charged vpon the left wing of the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian armie, where they of <hi>Scutarie</hi> ſerued) did draw all men to the regard and behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the fight on that ſide. Great was their labour and their daunger: for either partie ſhewing themſelues both ſtout and inuincible, did maintaine the fight egerly and couragiouſly; and they did ſo vnceſſantly contend ech to force other, as though the fortune of the fight had depended vpon them onely. It ſeemed that they were not very vnequally matched, and in that reſpect they fought for a long time with like ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, and hardly could it be diſcerned whether partie had the better. But at length the ſtrength and force of the Dybrians ſeeming to be weakned with faintnes and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe, and both themſelues and their horſes being well nigh tyred with continuall fighting, as men vanquiſhed willingly they would haue giuen ouer, and they were almoſt readie to leaue the battell, had it not beene for <hi>Moſes</hi> their Colonell, who ſharpely reprehending them, euen as they beganne to recuile, did ſometimes blame their faintnes and wearineſſe, and ſometimes did accuſe them of feare and cowardice: and being thus in point of being almoſt vanquiſhed, he taught them howe to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh and to be victors ouer their enemies, crying out in this manner vnto them.</p>
            <p>What a ſhame is this (my friends?) how lewd and foule an example is this of your<note place="margin">Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Moſes to his ſoldiers.</note> vnwonted feare and timerouſneſſe? Is it poſſible that the Dibrians can forſake their <q>ranckes and places aſſigned them, as long as they be liuing? or can they be content to loſe their honor and glorie purchaſed by armes, and to giue it to their enemies? where are thoſe ſouldiers which diſcomfited the forces of <hi>Haly</hi> Baſſa? who tamed the pride of <hi>Feriſey,</hi> &amp; abated the puiſſance of <hi>Muſtapha?</hi> and who with the ſpoiles of the Turks, haue enriched the houſes of the <hi>Albanois?</hi> Where is now the fiercenes of your haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and proud courages? where be thoſe your looks which were ſo full of threats and menaces within your campe? where be thoſe your promiſes of victorie and triumph? is this the way to recouer <hi>Dayna</hi> to <hi>Scanderbeg?</hi> is this the way for you to prepare your entry into the towne which you haue beſieged? what, did you neuer proue the vertue and valure of any enemy till now? haue you not found them any where elſe to be ſtout and valiant, and did you neuer ſee the ſwordes brandizing in any place but here onely? Behold howe your fellowes and companions are on all ſides victorious, and they do alreadie in ech quarter of the field, recount the frutes of their valure and hardineſſe. <hi>Tanuſee</hi> (hauing taken their Captaines and caried them bound into the campe) hath either diſperſed, or vtterly defeated and deſtroied the middle battell of the enemie: ſee (I pray you) how <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> hauing broken the ſtrength and bodie of the Sclauonian troupes, doth now paſſe away the time in binding them together like beaſtes, and taking of them priſoners: onely we here on our ſide haue nothing but feare and terror, and the memorie of our flight, moſt ſhamefull and diſhonorable.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The ſouldiers ſeeing themſelues ſo ſharply reproued and rebuked by <hi>Moſes,</hi> tooke hart to themſelues, and their courages were ſo enflamed with a moſt ardent deſire to repaire their fault, that a man would haue iudged them not to haue bene the ſame men, but that both horſe and men had bene chaunged euen in an inſtant. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict being then renewed, the fortune of the fight grew likewiſe to be chaunged, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:13368:60"/>
the Scutarians by litle and litle beganne to be repulſed, yet did they for a while hold good, by meanes rather of their multitude and great number, then through any hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or greatneſſe of courage. At the laſt <hi>Humoy</hi> coniecturing (by the former ſpeeches of his enemie) his brothers miſfortune (the griefe whereof, through verie impatiency, made him ſcarce able to holde his weapons) forgot his companions and went (though all too late) to ſuccour his brother, where ſtriking into the middeſt of his enemies: in ſo doing he both aſſured the victorie to the Dibrian, and left alſo vnto the poſteritie an euident teſtimonie, how needfull and requiſite it is for a chiefe or Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> to keepe amongſt his troupes: and how greatly it importeth the good order and <q>ſafetie of his companies to enioy the benefit of his preſence: for no ſooner was he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from his charge,</q> but they were ſuddenly diſperſed on all ſides, turning their backs to the blowes &amp; furie of their enemies. Likewiſe on the other ſide, the Generall of the Venetians being now forſaken and left deſtitute of the ſtrength of his corps du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde: yet holding ſtill good, and keeping his troupes cloſe &amp; in order (more through pure ſhame, then for any ſtrength or puiſſance that he had:) he ſuſtained the force of the enemie, and maintained the fight continually. But when he once perceiued that his ſouldiers were on all ſides put to a doubtles flight, and that all of them made de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault alike: himſelfe alſo ſetting ſpurres to his horſe for companie, (leaſt he ſhould be made a partner with the others in their miſfortunes) prouided by ſpeedie flight for<note place="margin">The victory of Scanderbeg ouer the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians.</note> his owne ſafetie. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> all at leiſure purſued thoſe that were ſcattered ouer the fieldes, becauſe that the long and continuall trauell of his ſouldiers did greatly detaine and hinder them, by reaſon the battell had bene foughten with that obſtinacie, and held out to that extreamitie, that they were hardly able to haue continued fight any longer: yet as wearie as they were, they did not for all that ſuffer their flight to be free and without any diſturbance: for <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> had publikely commaunded, that all the enſignes ſhould purſue after them, and follow the chaſe euen to the gates of <hi>Scuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</hi> It may be that this great Captaine being led on both with anger and with glorie, did hold it a goodly matter, that theſe enemies (who ſtood in infinite and thicke num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers vpon the walles, ſhould now ſee him and his armie to be the conquerors. In ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places did they light vpon the tayle or rereward of thoſe that fled, and a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſuch as made the leaſt ſpeed, came into the handes of thoſe that followed them: for they were commanded not to kill any of them when they were once come verie neare and within the view of the towne: then making a ſtand with their armie in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they continued there a long time with their colours wauing al aloft in the wind: hereupon, the victors aſſembling themſelues in troupes not farre from their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies thus arranged, with high cries and exceeding ſignes of ioy; they preſented their priſoners before the eyes of the townſmen, who were wondefully ſad and penſiue at this miſfortune and affliction, concerning them ſo neare, both in publike, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. On the one ſide, the grieuous ſight and miſerable condition of their friendes and allies, did ſuggeſt vnto them new prickes of warre and deſpight; on the other ſide their late loſſe did confound and abate their courages: and furthermore, the care of the Captiues (which ſtaied and withheld them, did keepe them from attempting or doing any thing againſt the enemie, for doubt leaſt it ſhould incenſe the vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to vſe the priſoners with more extreamitie.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> had permitted his ſouldiers (all at their pleaſures) to reioice themſelues in the honor of their victorie: he cauſed to ſound a march (for the day was then well neare ſpent) and euerie man prepared himſelfe to the retraite, &amp; tooke their way to the ſiege before <hi>Dayna:</hi> but vaine was the hope and conceit of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> in that he thought the inhabitantes would haue opened their portes and receiued him
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:13368:61"/>
forthwith, as his ſubiects, and haue ſubmitted themſelues vnder the lawes and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that it ſhould pleaſe him to impoſe vpon them: for albeit the ſudden diſcomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their friendes and confederates, and the neceſſitie of victuals, encreaſing daily within the towne, did redouble both the griefe and the care of the Daynians, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the companies of Albanois, left before the place expreſſely for that intent and purpoſe, had hindered them from foraging or making any other prouiſion: yet did they not conceiue any one diſhonorable thought within their hearts, for the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of themſelues from ſo many miſchieues and wants which oppreſſed them. But euen in the middeſt of theſe extremities, prouiding and diſpoſing all things with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table conſtancie and ſingular good diſcretion; they began more ſparingly then they had accuſtomed, to ſhare out the munition and victuals vnto the ſouldiers, allowing either of them ſo much onely as ſhould ſuffiſe to ſuſtaine their faithfull ſoules, and (as the ſaying is) might hold bodie &amp; ſoule together. As for the aged perſons there was no order taken for them, becauſe it was ſuppoſed ſuch perſons ſhould not want anie meanes, wherewithall to helpe themſelues, either by the naturall ſtrength and ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the place, or by their fidelitie which was of all other the moſt aſſured rampier.</p>
            <p>Now when <hi>Caſtriot</hi> had ioyned his victorious troupes, to thoſe which lay before the towne, he pained himſelfe (but in vaine) to repreſent vnto their grieued heartes, the motions of vaine feare. With great ſhewes and oſtentation, with many repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and high cries, he cauſed the enſignes and colours gained from the enemie, to be ſhewed vnto them: great numbers of captiues ſad and ſorrowfull, were led round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the towne, with their eyes caſt downe to the ground, for ſhame that they ſhould be ſeene in that plight by their allies and friends, (who ſtood in thicke troupes vpon the walles, and who at ſo hideous a ſight did ſhead abundance of teares.) For there were many among the captiues, who were of kinne and nearely allied to the beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, as may be eaſily perceiued by that which hath bene before recited. Now <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi> knowing that his perſwaſions were of no force nor efficacie towards men ſo throughly reſolued: he began to treate with them for the yeelding of the towne, and with a certaine kind of confidence all aſſured, he demanded that the garriſon of the <q>Venetians might be yeelded into his hands: but his raſh demaund had a notable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,<note place="margin">The liberall and free an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of the Danians to Scanderbeg.</note> well beſeeming the vertue of franke and free citizens: telling him, that he ſhould deſiſt from terrifying their eares and their eyes with ſuch ſights and menaces: that their faith was not grounded vpon ſo light a foundation, as that they would mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them ſelues rather by a new accident of croſſe and peruerſe fortune, then by the ancient habit of their mindes and diſpoſitions: that they had all of them determined (if they could not otherwiſe do) to leaue vnto their good Princes, an eternall teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of their vnfortunate faith, by the witneſſe of their diſmembred bodies: and that neither the loue nor affection which they did beare to their owne, nor the captiuitie of their confederates was ſuch, that they ſhould hope thereby, to extort from them any ſuch action of pietie, which might tend to their ſtaine and ignominie, and ſuch, as the priſoners them ſelues (if they were put to the queſtion) would not require to be vſed towards them. Moreouer, that they were in good hope that their Seigniours the Venetians, would not ſuffer either the bonds &amp; captiuitie of the one to be perpetuall, or the ſiege of the other to be of any long continuance: that he ſhould take this their example as a true proofe and enſignement, that the faith of anie people ought not to<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> change and turne with the wind, nor to follow the inſtable and vnconſtant fortune of Princes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It was a wonderfull ſigne and token of liberalitie and naturall clemencie in <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg,</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:13368:61"/>
in that (ſeeing his reaſons and demaunds ſo neglected and reiected by the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes<note place="margin">Scanderbeg his curteſie and magnanimity to the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian captiues.</note> of <hi>Dayna,</hi> and all hope taken away to obtaine the towne, by reaſon of this their obſtinacie) yet he ſhewed not any kind of diſcontentment (as the moſt part of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are naturally inclined) neither had he recourſe to any termes of wrath or furie, or deſire of reuenge, and leaſt of all did he exerciſe any crueltie vppon the priſoners, whereas he might haue vſed them as himſelfe had liſted: but contrariwiſe he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded preſently that they ſhould be vnbound, and hauing gratiouſly entreated and cheered them, he ſet them at libertie, and ſent them away to their owne houſes. It may be that this politique and ſage Captaine did this of purpoſe, which his intent though it be not to be allowed, yet the deuice and inuention is much to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: for that being notable any other way to ſubdue the walles of the Danians, he might at leaſtwiſe vanquiſh them by this courteſie and humanitie; and might gaine thoſe by gratious vſage, whom neither rigour nor force could any way remoue from their determination and purpoſe.

            <p>Theſe things being thus atchieued, he had a new deuiſe in his head to bring the towne vnder his ſubiection: to the intent therfore, the thing which he ſo affectionately deſired, might be brought to ſome good end and perfection, he enterpriſed an action, whereby he might with more facilitie and commoditie not only further &amp; aduance the ſiege of <hi>Dayna,</hi> but the meanes of the whole warre betwene him &amp; the Venetians.</p>
            <p>There was ſometimes a towne named <hi>Baleze,</hi> of which as then there was nothing<note place="margin">Baleze.</note> remaining but a ſmall ſhew &amp; the ruines only: it had bene ſomwhat renowned, not for that it was founded by any man of name or memorie, but onely for the antiquitie thereof: it was ſeated at the foote of the mount Sardonicke (which the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple<note place="margin">The mount Sardonikor Marra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This ſame place being fortified and defended with a good garriſon and ſome other forces, he was of the opinion, that he might by the benefit thereof, more freely annoy the Venetian territorie, and keepe the beſieged from hauing any releefe or ſuccours, by reaſon, that the enemie ſhould be buſied on all partes with ſo many occaſions: for this purpoſe he cauſed it at one inſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This done, he repaſſed the ſame day ouer the riuer <hi>Drinon,</hi> to proſecute the ſiege of <hi>Dayna,</hi> which for no occaſion of time or other affaires, he would ſuffer in no caſe to be intermitted.</p>
            <p>The fortifications and walles of the new fortreſſe being finiſhed, and many bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warkes being raiſed within it as ſeemed moſt expedient, <hi>Ameſe</hi> being a young man and impatient of reſt (both his owne peculiar reputation, and the freſh renowne of his vncles vertue, animating his youthful mind hereunto) becauſe he had ſomewhat hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily made certaine rodes and light inuaſions vpon the plaine countrey, he imagined
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:13368:62"/>
that he ſhould be as fortunate in all other matters of greater weight and importance. And therefore he caſt in his minde, with a full reſolution to ſurpriſe <hi>Driuaſta,</hi> which was a towne there neere adioyning: this made him that from thence forward he had<note place="margin">Driuaſta.</note> no other thought daily then to make readie his companie, though he disfurniſhed<note place="margin">Ameſe purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to ſurpriſe Driuaſta.</note> the new fortreſſe of the garriſon, for he thought that his commendation ſhould by this act be the more augmented, if (before any ſuccour were ſent from his vncle, and ere that he knew any newes thereof) he might ſuddenly ſend vnto him the markes of ſo notable an exploit, by the ſpoiles of the towne once conquered and ſubdued: and that it would be a ſecret argument that his vncles valure were now in the wane, and did as it were, waxe old vnder the wals of <hi>Dayna:</hi> ſo fondly did the boiling heate of this young mans courage puffe him vp with hope, vainely promiſing vnto himſelfe all the fauours of fortune. But <hi>Marin</hi> (whoſe induſtrie <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> had made choiſe of, and had made equal with the other, for the ſurer preſeruation of the new fortreſſe, hauing therein ioyned moſt vnfortunately, the prudence of the one with the temeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the other) <hi>Marin</hi> (I ſay) being an old and expert ſouldier, by reaſon of his long practiſe in matters militarie, and being more venerable for his age: fearing, that if openly he did withſtand the wilfulneſſe of this youth, there might grow ſecret diſlike and enmitie betweene them (a moſt peſtilent miſchiefe in the adminiſtration of anie affaires.) For this cauſe he thought that he would in the very beginning breake off this enterprieſe, by alienating of the deuotion of the ſouldiers from him ſecretly, and by that meanes would diſappoint him of his purpoſe: but afterwards when he ſawe that the affections of them all in common, and that the inordinate lycenſe of the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier did encline more to the other partie, he reſolued in the ende to ſpeake his minde openly &amp; freely in the preſence of al the whole company, to the intent himſelfe might be diſcharged from that default which was likely (by another mans counſell) to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede vnhappily: and therefore (as the ſpeech is) in theſe or the like termes, he gaue him this admonition.</p>
            <p>Certenly <hi>Ameſe; Scanderbeg</hi> hath left thee heere a greater croſſe vnto me then the<note place="margin">Marin Span his ſpeech to Ameſe.</note> Venetians our enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for now that we haue other matters to looke vnto, by <q>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the heat of this warre throughout all the country: I am conſtrained and driuen to a new ſtrife and contention, cauſing ſome ſecret hate or diſlike betweene vs, becauſe that thou art growen to haue a vehement ſuſpition leaſt I (of a deſire to contradict thee or through the ielouſie of thy youthfull glorie and reputation,) doe ſeeme to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thee from this thy enterpriſe. But why do I impute any fault vnto my ſelfe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both God and men will ſufficiently acquite me, for that this my counſell in this caſe and concerning this accident, either (being neglected) ſeemeth not to haue bene wanting, or (being followed and allowed) cannot well be reprehended? The loſſe will ſurely be thine owne and no mans elſe, for in this action (whatſoeuer thy intent be) it is not the citie of <hi>Driuaſta,</hi> but thy ſelfe and thy vncle, that thou goeſt to aſſaile: thou doeſt but haſten to abridge the daies of thy owne friends and fellow citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and to bath the enemies ground with the blood of thy ſouldiers. Haue we to this end repaired this new towne? haue we fortified it with ſuch ſtrong companies, and with a garriſon of ſo many braue men, to the end it ſhould be ſo ſuddenly diſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and diſfurniſhed of her forces? and while we fooliſhly ſeeke after others, our own fortreſſe ſhould be left and deliuered as a prey vnto our enemies, who expect and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for nothing elſe? Say that this place were not to be regarded, yet is there any of you that will thinke that townes will be ſurprized with ſo ſmall a mumber of ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eres, who would ſcarcely ſuffice to defend them? eſpecially the towne of <hi>Driuaſta,</hi> which (as it is large and populous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) ſo (for in this reſpect we may commend our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

it is likewiſe excellently well prouided both of armes and of men couragious and valiaunt. If I be not deceiued both you and the enemy doe expect one and the ſame thing. Firſt their old men and other of the weak and vnable multitude, from the battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their wals, will make a ieſt at your fooliſh preparations, and at your vaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes in ſeeking thus to take their city. And then their young men, who (being fierce and luſty) do deſire nothing ſo much as to come to fight with you, iſſuing forth of the towne, will force vs to leaue the aſſault, and will chaſe vs away with ſhame and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny, or elſe leauing their ports open to receiue vs, ſodainely and vnaduiſed they will ſurprize and ſet vpon vs, and ſo reuenge the late loſſe of their companions, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries of the Scutarians. Then will other townes take courage vnto them, and thoſe who are now ouercome and vanquiſhed, will become to grow hardy, and nothing at all to redoubt vs. Lay aſide therefore (I pray thee <hi>Ameſe</hi> whileſt all things are well and whole) this your pernicious forwardnes and audacity: and do not cauſe the reuerent and honorable name ofthy vncle, by ſo great an indignity to be diſgraced &amp; rent aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by the mouths of thoſe that are his aduerſaries and ill willers. Stay a while, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend till that God fauour thee, in preſenting thee ſome other matter of more abundant and greater glory, and with greater ſafety and ſecurity. Then will I be the formoſte man, not to perſwade thee only, but to cauſe thee to take armes, and will alſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany thee. No man will be vnwilling to follow thoſe enſignes which are fortunate. Reſtraine therefore the broyling heat of this thy courage (though it be hard to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained) learne of thy ancients, firſt thy ſelfe to beare the yoke, which thou deſireſt to impoſe vpon thy enemy. For youth being vncapeable of good counſell, (let me ſpeake<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> freely what I thinke) is oftentimes as hurtfull vnto it ſelfe, as vnto thoſe which are his enemies. It is rather to be drawen then to beled to any thing, &amp; of all the burdens that are laied vpon men, the vnaduiſed wilfulneſſe of youth is the moſt dangerous. Wars are to be managed by counſell and good aduiſe, and let the wiſeſt Captaine cary him ſelfe in all his actions, neuer ſo ſagely and aduiſedly, yet hardly and with great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty doth Fortune anſwere his deſerts, or ſucceed accordingly.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The graue and prudent ſpeeches of this perſonage, were ſufficient to haue changed the mind of this yong ſouldier. But becauſe in the haſtineſſe of his owne temerity, and the raſhneſſe of his owne counſels, hee had already ordained and prouided all thinges which were expedient and neceſſary for that enterpriſe; it ſeemed vnto him a matter of more diſhonor, to giue ouer (by diſcretion) the attempt which he had vndertaken, then (with misfortune) to put the ſame in execution. Hee reiected therfore this whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and ſound admonition, and preferring the worſt before the beſt, he held it leſſe ſhame and diſgrace, to follow his own humor (though it were to his loſſe and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce) then by reforming himſelfe vpon the admonition of an other, to take that choiſe which might be for his benefit and aduantage. Beſides the credit which he had purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the companies, and the readines of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſouldiers obedient to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand did animate his fooliſh deſires, and did withhold his doubtfull eares from hark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto any good aduertiſements. To that therefore which <hi>Marin Spaniard</hi> had perſwaded ſo aduiſedly, firſt of all he replied with great inſolency, that his vncle had<note place="margin">Anſwere of Ameſe to Marin Span.</note> 
               <q>left either of them with like power, commaundement, and authority: that hee was not appointed there to gouerne himſelfe either in peace or war, at the liking and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biterment of another:</q> that he ſhould looke to his owne companies: and that for his part, it was in him to command his ſouldiers at his owne will and pleaſure. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding within a litle while after, when his choller was a litle cooled by ſpeaking, and that the vehement and immoderate paſſion of his mind, was ſomewhat ſetled and abated, then began his tongue to be much more modeſt, and his ſpeaches grew more
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:13368:63"/>
               <q>milde and gracious. For he told his colleague &amp; companion, that he would willingly approue and allow of his opinion, were it not that the affaires of <hi>Baleze</hi> and <hi>Driuaſta</hi> might both at once be directed and ordered, &amp; that neither of them would hinder and diſturbe the other: that their forces were ſufficient both to guard the one and to cary the other: and that he did not ſo inconſideratly vndertake this attempt, but that he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well knew what he did: that he would ſurprize them of <hi>Driuaſta</hi> ſodainely and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouided: that he ſhould finde the youth of the towne out of armes, the gates vngar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the wals without ſentinels: beſides that, there were many of the inhabitants which (if they were ſummoned to yeeld) would gladly hearken vnto him. But admit that all things do fall out more difficult then he expected, that then he meant not to be ſo obſtinate as to make there any long abode, to the preiudice of his ſouldiers.</q> And in ſaying this he tooke <hi>Maryn</hi> by the hand, praying him to be of good courage, and to hopewell of his ſucceſſe. Thus hauing recommended his affairs vnto God, he diſplaid his enſignes, and ſo marched chearefully onward. Of thoſe which remained behinde<note place="margin">Ameſe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize Driuaſta</note> with <hi>Marin</hi> for the gard of <hi>Baleze,</hi> they were ſcant fully 2000, not that any man was enforced to accompany them in that iourney, but becauſe that the Albanois were more exerciſed in labor and trauell, then in lying idle and at reſt: and the ſouldiers had no kinde of warre more agreeable, and familiar vnto them, then the aſſaulting and ſurpriſing of townes and holdes.</p>
            <p>Now albeit <hi>Ameſe</hi> did haſten on with all poſsible celerity, and did conceale his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt as much as might be, yet could he not preuent the newes of his comming. For the Driuaſtines being aduertiſed of his approach, (as men that could ſoone deſcry any ſuch purpoſe) and at the very beginning of the war of <hi>Dayna,</hi> did ordinarily keepe and maintaine great courts of guard in certaine places about their towne, and a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, purpoſely to watch in armes: they were notwithſtanding at the firſt great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſtoniſhed, and mounting vpon their wals, they made preparation of all ſuch things as were requiſite to repulſe the enemy, bringing from all partes ſtones and ſuch other munitions, which were fit to be throwen downe vpon them and to annoy them. But afterwardes when they had a ſight of the enemy, as they drew neare the towne, they grew ſodainely to be both better encouraged and leſſe carefull; contemning both the ſmalneſſe of their numbers, and their Captaine all alike. Notwithſtanding the good countenance which they made, did nothing at all apall or diminiſh the confidence of the yong Chiefetaine, but he ſummoned them within the towne (in the name of <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi>) with many faire offers and promiſes, to render the ſame vnto him. But being rudely repulſed and with many ſharpe tearmes reiected: (hee reſting as yet in ſuſpence and doubtfull, and being withall caried away with choller and indignation) retired himſelfe about a mile and a halfe from the towne, where all in vaine, according to the variable and diuerſe opinions of his ſouldiers, he beate his braines, deuiſing by what means he might bring the towne to reaſon, ſeeing he had no ordinance wherewithall to batter them. Thus did he ſeeme both to conſult and to beſiege the towne, all at one time. In the meane time to aſſure his troups from a ſurprize, but principally from towardes <hi>Scutarie,</hi> he placed skoutes and watches round about the place where hee was encamped.</p>
            <p>Whileſt theſe things were thus in doing: the Driuaſtines with a worthy and verie commendable care did bethinke themſelues, how to free their towne from the doubt of this ſiege, &amp; their concluſion was (whatſoeuer became thereof) to hazard the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, before the enemy ſhould attempt to force their wals and rampiers. The author of this their reſolution was <hi>Andrew Angell,</hi> one of the chiefeſt men of accompt within their towne, noble by his owne worthy actes, and well knowen by the honor which
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:13368:63"/>
he had gotten by his long practiſe in armes. This man (hauing ranged his men in good order ofbattel at the lower gate of the city, which lieth on the weſt towards the plaine, &amp; the wals of the city being well manned, and the ports ſtrongly garded, before that he ſalied forth vpon the enemies) he began to encorage them with this language.</p>

Now ſeeing our fortune by ſo notable a ſpectacle hath brought vs to this, that wee are driuen to combat both before and for our wals, will not you (my good companions &amp; moſt louing citizens) imitate the example of your aunceſters, and maintaine the welfare of your town, your countrey, your houſes, your temples, and your altars? To what end ſhould I recount vnto you the manifold triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phs which they gained vpon their enemies, &amp; which you your ſelues haue yet freſh in your memory? Let it ſuffice of a great many to recite a few, ſeeing the ſhortneſſe of the time will not permit any long diſcourſe. I remember well that I haue heard it reported by my forefathers, how <hi>Barach</hi> a Turkiſh Captaine<note place="margin">Driuaſtines their valiant exploites a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their enemies.</note> in the raigne of <hi>Amurath</hi> the firſt, with 20000. horſemen, inuading this our territory in the beginning of the warre, did make this demand vnto our citizens, That the keies of the towne ſhould be deliuered him, vppon ſuch conditions as he would propound vnto them. But they not willing to ſubmit them ſelues vppon ſuch tearmes: and he falling to the burning of the country, and deſtroying of the fruites with fire &amp; ſword, the people (I ſay) of <hi>Driuaſta</hi> came vpon them in full troups as they were here &amp; there diſperſed; in ſuch ſort that (many of them being left engaged dead in the fieldes, and many of them being made priſoners) they enforced the reſidue to betake them ſelues to flight: and hauing by this meanes obtained a notable victory, they returned into the towne rich and triumphant. What ſhould I tell you of <hi>Steuen</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Herceck,</hi> Duke of <hi>Boſina,</hi> who in like manner being entred within our limits, with an army of fiue and twenty thouſand, vnder pretence of the like expedition; firſt ſummoned the towne to yeelde vnto him: but our braue Driuaſtines, by their ſtout and lofty refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, put him in ſuch rage and fury: that he preſently ſent forth his troupes to ouerrun the countrey, and make hauocke of all things? But what did our citizens? they went to encounter him with a good company both of horſe and foot, they charged him with great furye, they brake and diſcomfited him, and they purſued after him in chaſe ſo greedily, that beſides a great ſlaughter of the enemies, and many enſignes gained, they returned triumphant and loaden with prey and booty into the town: honoring their countrey by the preſeruation of their liberty and them ſelues, in their glory and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. March we on therefore (my good friends) and let our ſelues be the meſſengers to our ſenceleſſe enemies, of that aunſwere which our towne ſendeth them with ſo great vertue and reſolution. Let vs take from theſe few ſtraglers or robbers their vaine and fooliſh hope of winning of towns with ſuch weak forces and ſo ill accompanied. What thinke you of the ſtout reſiſtance of <hi>Dayna,</hi> before which <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> him ſelfe with ſo great an army, hath for ſo long a time bene buſied? Will not this be a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull touch of reproach and infamy vnto all of you, that his nephew ſhould haue a Commiſſion ſo baſely to ſurprize vs with ſo ſmall forces, the which will be ſcant able within a while to defend their owne fortreſſe?

            <p>This ſhort ſpeach did ſo animate the Driuaſtines, that all of them at once began to<note place="margin">Driuaſtines ſally forth of Driuaſta a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Ameſe.</note> make a noiſe, and with a loude voice they willed him to lead them on againſt the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.

Then began the cry to be renued on all parts, and on the one ſide the diſcomfiture of their captaine, and on the other ſide the ſodaine approach of the enemy, did take away from the gards all meanes to rally them ſelues together, and to renue the fight. Finally, the forces of the enemy being reioyned and vnited, they made towards the Fort, where (after long debate) the aduantage fell to the Driuaſtines: and all things enclining to fauour them, the Ameſens did abandon the defence of their trenches, and on diuerſe ſides flying and fighting all at once, they retired them ſelues into the plaine. <hi>Angell</hi> made no rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konning to purſue them, nor to ſacke their campe: but thinking he had done enough in depriuing them of the victory, cauſed to ſound a retraite, and led backe his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with great reioyſing into the city: But the ioy of this good and happy encounter did not long continue to the inhabitants. For <hi>Ameſe</hi> hauing gathered his ſouldiers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether from their flight, and thinking vpon this diſcomfiture (the ſhame wherof was greater then the loſſe) and ſeeing himſelfe fruſtrate of all hope to gaine <hi>Driuaſta,</hi> hee<note place="margin">Ameſe ſpoileth the countrey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Driuaſta.</note> turned the impatiency of his anger elſe where, not ſparing any thing whatſoeuer could be found, either for encreaſe or recreation, but both the houſes were burnt and ruinated, and all ſorts of trees and plants were cut down and deſtroied. Nothing was left vntoucht, except a few Oliue trees, (the abundance and fertility of the which, doth
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:13368:64"/>
make that towne to haue great traffique, and to be much eſteemed:) all theſe ſpoilings and ruines notwithſtanding, and for that <hi>Ameſe</hi> ſpoiled (a good waies off from their Ports) the Driuaſtines though their hardines had once ſucceeded happily) yet would not they againe be drawen into the fields, fearing that if they ſhould range abroad too farre, their returne might be hindered, or they might fall into ſome ambuſcado, and ſo ſhould they giue an account for their too too great forwardneſſe, and their ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much hardineſſe might coſt ſome of them full dearely.</p>
            <p>I hold it not amiſſe here to lay downe in ſome ſort the deſcription of the towne of<note place="margin">The Towne of Driuasta.</note> 
               <hi>Driuaſta,</hi> not much renowmed neither for her foundation, nor for her antiquity, albeit the credulous error of the inhabitaunts doth moſt obſtinately attribute the originall thereof to the Romains, alleadging that they were the firſt founders of the ſame. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in do they moſt glory, in that they affirme themſelues to be a Colony of the Romains, and they do preciſely maintaine, that from thence they had their deſcent and original. For my part, I ſuppoſe that the humor of theſe men, ſo deſirous of glory, is rather to be pardoned, then that their opinion is any way to be credited. For neither are there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny teſtimonies of good authority to ratifie this perſwaſion, neither are there any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents to confirme it. The like fortune alſo hath <hi>Antibara,</hi> a towne of verie good<note place="margin">Antibara.</note> accompt in theſe our daies within the ſayd countrey, and (not without cauſe) doeth it complaine of the vngratefull ſilence of the ancients. Notwithſtanding the ſeat of <hi>Dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaſta</hi> (in my iudgement) ſeemeth not vnworthy (if reaſon may perſwade vs) to haue a Colony there erected, both in regard of the pleaſantnes of the place, and of the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and commodity of all things, which may allure men to inhabite or manure it. For the territory of that city is moſt fertile and fruitfull, yeelding all things which mans life in reaſon can wiſhe for. On euery ſide there are great ſtore of ſprings and<note place="margin">Scituation of Driuaſta.</note> fountains, ariſing and deſcending with a pleaſant noiſe from the hils adioyning, which by nature are ſo orderly mounted, as if they had bene diſpoſed by artificiall workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: and moſt wonderfully doe they adorne and beautifie the plaine countrey. The aire (on what ſide ſoeuer you turne your eies) is exceedingly healthfull, and it doth ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and temper all things, ſo as it maketh them to proſper ſingularly. The Citie is ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon the diſcent of a mountaine, bending towards the South, and extending to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the plaine (where it is watered with a brooke called <hi>Clire</hi>) which may more iuſtly be tearmed by the name of a riuer, by reaſon that the ſtreames thereof do neuer faile, for any drought or diſtemperature of the ſommer whatſoeuer. The circuit of the wals and trenches is aboue two miles in compaſſe. The fortreſſe or caſtel (being ſeated vpon the top of a mountaine) by nature and by art is moſt defenſible: it both comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and defendeth the city. From <hi>Scutarie</hi> it is diſtant 8. miles, and from <hi>Motry</hi> 27. This towne hauing beene raſed by the Gallo grecians in the declining eſtate of the Romaine Empire, was reedified &amp; reſtored by <hi>Helena,</hi> a moſt chriſtian Princeſſe deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended<note place="margin">Helena the wife of Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana king of the Miſians.</note> of the bloud royall of the houſe of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and who was eſpouſed to <hi>Simeon Nemagna,</hi> king of the Miſians and Sclauonians. This Lady being very deuout &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, did reſtore (beſides this) many other townes neare adioyning, which had bene likewiſe ruinated in that country. Shee builded alſo both in <hi>Epire</hi> and <hi>Sclauonie,</hi> many Couents, Monaſteries and religious houſes, &amp; endowed them with great liuings and poſſeſſions, as is manifeſtly to be ſeene, by the marbles engrauen with ſuch teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, beſides other monuments and memorable markes of her bountifull and prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deedes. But returne we to our purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The choller of <hi>Ameſe</hi> being fully diſcharged vpon the plaine country of the Driua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines (which he had made in a maner deſolate) he had no deſire to returne anie more to <hi>Baleze,</hi> becauſe being aſhamed of his aduenture, hee was loath (after the triall of his

miſhap, and the proofe of his imprudency and temerity) to come in his preſence, to whom he had refuſed to giue eare, when time and place ſerued. And he now repented (though all too late) that he had contemned his good counſell. He turned therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way, &amp; marched with his companies directly towards <hi>Dayna:</hi> ſhunning moſt vnaduiſedly the reprehenſion of his fellow <hi>Marin,</hi> to endure the diſpleaſure far more dangerous, and the frowning countenance of his vncle, whom he had moſt grieuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incenſed. For <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> hauing had tidings brought him by ſome, dwelling neare the ſame place, how all things had paſſed, aſſoone as hee knew of his comming, he ſent for him to his preſence, and openly in the ſight of all his companies (which was <q>hardly digeſted of the young gentleman) in extreame choller hee conuinced him as<note place="margin">Scanderbeg reproueth Ameſe for his temerity.</note> guilty of all the fault that had bene committed. He accuſed him (and as his debtor) he challenged him, demanding of him the innocent bloud of his companions, which he had cauſed to be ſhed through his folly, terming him with a loud voice both raſh and arrogant, that without any commiſsion from him had plaied ſo fooliſh a part. He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected vnto him moreouer, that at his departure from <hi>Baleze,</hi> he commanded him no ſuch matter. That he ought to haue taken &amp; interpreted his ſilence, as a manifeſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition &amp; an appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t argument, that his will was not to haue any ſuch proceedings.</q> Afterwards when he had examined the ſouldiers which were preſent at that ſeruice, and was by their report certified that the matter was altogether concluded and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted without the aduiſe &amp; conſent of his companion, his fury grew then to be much more vehement, and his minde being full of wrath and indignation, he perſiſted in <q>this ſeuerity, ſaying: that it grieued him ſo much the more, becauſe, beſides the teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the act, he had added a more grieuous and inhumaine fault, in deſtroying by a moſt miſerable example, the fieldes of the citizens, &amp; in vſing cruelty with ſword and fire againſt their trees and buildings.</q> But <hi>Ameſe</hi> as one confounded (hauing not anie thing to anſwere for his excuſe) replied not a word: but ſtood ſtill ſilent, only turning <q>him ſelfe a litle aſide to his companions: good God (quoth he) there is nothing more<note place="margin">Speeches of Ameſe vpon the reproach of his vncle.</note> infamous then a man that is vanquiſhed: for he muſt on the one ſide, accept to endure the inſolency and triumph of his enemies: and on the other, the fearefull countenance and wrathfull viſage of his friends.</q> Hereupon the whole companies aſſembling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues about <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> did humbly entreat him to mitigate his wrath, and to pardon him his diſpleaſure: alleadging, that the youth of his nephew was enough chaſtized, and his misfortune was ſufficiently aggrauated with the bitter ſpeeches he had giuen him, and that themſelues (as well as other) were culpable of the ſame offence. By meanes of theſe interceſsions made by his ſouldiers, was their Generall ſoone intreated and pacified: ſo familiar and curteous was his nature and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>

            <p>After that <hi>Muſtapha</hi> had obtained leaue of <hi>Amurath</hi> to begin the watre, prouiſion being made of all things for his Campe: he conceiued in him ſelfe a wonderfull courage, thinking by one onely peece of ſeruice, to ende and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all the toyle and trauell of the whole warres: and from thence foorth he did not (after the faſhion and manner of thoſe which deale cloſely and cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) conceale his preparations: but openly and apparantly bearing him ſelfe both in countenance and behauiour as an open enemy hee, ſeemed to bee the man that durſt and would hazard the fortune of a battell in any place where the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banois</hi> would offer and preſent it vnto him. In the meane while the garriſon which was left vppon the confines of <hi>Macedonie,</hi> had ſent word in poſt haſt to <hi>Caſtriot</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Dayna,</hi> enforming him particularly of the whole caſe as it ſtood, and making knowen vnto him the whole eſtate of their affaires. Whereupon this Prince in a good reſolution (as an expert ſouldiour, that vſed no leſſe celeritie then cunning in all his actions) preſently diſpatched away an other freſh poaſt: by whom he charged them that in any caſe, they ſhould not giue the Baſſa any occaſion or opportunitie to come to fight with them, but retiring their troupes ſometimes to the thickets and woodes vpon the mountaines where they might be ſecure of the enemy; and ſometimes vnder colour of a timerous and fearefull flight, they ſhould abuſe him, and by little and little protract the aduenture and hazard of fight: till ſuch time as him ſelfe (being arriued thither with his companies,) ſhould giue order for all things, what ſoeuer ſhould be needefull to accompliſh their deſire and purpoſe: and that then they ſhould not faile, ſpeedely and aſſoone as they perceiued him to draw neare, to ioyne them ſelues in one with his traine and to follow him: to the intent, that where him ſelfe ſhould be in perſon, there alſo might be the enſignes, the ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, and the whole force and ſtrength of the Campe. This done (albeit it greeued him greatly to ſee him ſelfe withdrawen from the of ſiege <hi>Dayna</hi>) calling <hi>Ameſe</hi> (his friend and faithfull companion in all dangers and perils) vnto him, he gaue him in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:13368:66"/>
charge to haue a carefull eye vnto the ſiege: and he ſpake vnto the young man not onely by way of counſell, but alſo by entreatie: praying him not to alter any thing in his abſence, nor in any wiſe to make any attempt againſt the beſieged, hauing bene ſufficiently warned and inſtructed by his owne former diſgrace. And he willed him not to bowdge nor ſtirre a foote from before the walles, but ſo to gouerne him ſelfe, that they within the towne, might not either make any prouiſion of victuals, either haue any meanes to refreſh them ſelues. Hereupon (out of the armie which hee had there, and which by this meanes was greatly diminiſhed) he made choiſe of fiue hundred horſe, and a thouſand fiue hundred foote of the beſt and moſt picked ſouldiers, with which he purpoſed to ſtrengthen the old garriſon, againſt the new emotions of the Turkes. Theſe ſouldiours which had the foyle at <hi>Dryuaſta,</hi> were commaunded and enforced to ſtay at the ſiege vnder the gouernement of their young Gouernour, which greeued them at the very hartes: for each of them deſired, and all of them in generall did inſtantly requeſt the Prince, that he would permit them to make amendes of their former default, by ſome vertuous act of freſh marke and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory: and by the purchaſe of ſome new honor, to aboliſh the remembrance of their late diſhonor. Notwithſtanding not any of them had their requeſt graunted, both by reaſon of the preſent eſtate of his affaires, which diſſwaded him from taking all his forces with him: and alſo for that he could not in this caſe gratifie ſome of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a certaine diſcorde and diſcontentment of the reſidue: and becauſe there was not any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but did eſteeme himſelfe to haue aſmuch valour as any one of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, he tooke none with him but the very chiefe and ſtrength of all his armie: namely the old ſouldiours, and ſuch as were beſt hardened, or moſt able to endure in armes: for well knew this moſt expert Chieftaine, what difference there is, betwixt the beſieging of the walles of a towne, where men lying incamped idle with their handes in their boſomes, doe onely waite by time to enforce and bring a place to reaſon: and the ſeeking in open field, neare at hand, and in the face of the enemy by the fury of fight and mortall blowes, to purchaſe honor and glory, not eaſily to be gained or without great difficulty.</p>

This ſo new and ſtraunge a caſe, and this great ſilence, ſeeming to them verie ſuſpitious, did at the firſt ſhew, make them fearefull and full of horrour: but afterwardes, certaine of their companie being ſent foorth to diſcouer the enemie, and hauing brought word backe, that they were departed thence: their whole armie approched the fort without any feare. The ſight of the place ſo ſolitarie, and the diſlodging of the garriſon did mightely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe thoſe, which were of great and hautie courages, ſeeing that there was nothing but the poore walles for them to bend their forces againſt, and the Towne onely, without any liuing creature in it. Aboue all others, <hi>Humoy</hi> (of whom we haue before ſpoken) was in a great rage and choller: by reaſon of the exceſsiue deſire which hee had by ſome like match and good hap, to be reuenged for his brothers captiuitie, (for the truth is,) it vexed him extreamely, that he could by no meanes obtaine his deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi> And it may be that he went thither (as amitie and friendſhip doth make the mindes of men very vigilant) to the intent at the ſurpriſing of this place, he might get into his handes, ſome pledge and raunſome of good worth, thereby to make an exchaunge for the perſon of his brother, who was detained priſoner. On all ſides did the ſouldiours clime and leape ouer the walles, for the razing and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the which their ordinance was not needefull to do them any vſe or ſeruice. For the ſtones cleauing but ſlenderly together by reaſon that the morter was in a<note place="margin">Baleze razed by the Scuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</note> manner new and lately layed, and being beaten downe with barres of iron, and torne vp without any great labour, they did eaſily enough tumble downe of them ſelues alone: in a ſmall ſpace therefore was all ouerthrowen and ruinated. The reſt which was made of wood, pallizadoes, and other ſuch like defences, were not long able to continue againſt the fire, which was put vnto them, and did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together conſume them: the ſouldiours cabbines and all other fortifications like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe were troden vnder foote and layed euen with the ground. Thus the <hi>Scu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians</hi> of an ouer haſtie deſire to ſatisfie their hatred and malicious mindes, by a dead kinde of reuenge, left that towne moſt deformed and hideous to looke vnto: in doing whereof they were the cauſe but of their owne dammage and greater griefe and calamitie, in making it the ſubiect of future reuenge to their enemy. There were ſome of the companie, whoſe counſell was, that they ſhould march with their forces before <hi>Dayna,</hi> both to chaſe the enemy from the ſiege, and to trye the fortune of battell, ſeeing that all things ſeemed to encline to them, and to promiſe them victorie, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> beeing abſent from his armie. But the ſmall number of their forces made them that they durſt not doe it: beſides ſome others there were, who would not in any caſe agree to hazard and aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture any further, then the Generall and gouernour of <hi>Scutarie</hi> had giuen them in charge and commandement. Wherefore they turned their enſignes and retired their troupes home towardes <hi>Scutarie,</hi> without hauing done any thing worthy of glorie or commendation, either by the purchaſe of any bootie or priſoners, or by the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of any of their enemies.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide <hi>Maryn</hi> hauing brought his garriſon backe to <hi>Dayna,</hi> did reuiue in <hi>Ameſe</hi> a griefe to ſee the misfortune and ſhame bee fallen to them in publique, and yet priuately he did euen ſmile through a kinde of contentment, which he tooke in his owne particular miſhap: in that he ſeemed not onely and alone, thus ſhamefully to be foyled and repulſed by the <hi>Dryuaſtines,</hi> but that his colleague and

            <p>Thus on the one ſide did matters paſſe on with complaints, and murmurings. On<note place="margin">The procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the warre, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtapha and Scanderbeg.</note> the other ſide <hi>Muſtapha</hi> hauing ſent forth his ſouldiers into the countrey, did not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Garriſon of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> to be at reſt, but by their continuall and daily roades and inuaſions which they made vppon them, they did more and more terrifie them. For the Albanois ſhunning the fight continually, did ſtand vppon their defence, ſometimes relying vppon the ſtrength of their trenches and fortified places, rather then vppon their valour and force of armes. And ſometimes ſallying forth in ſmall troupes, and faining a flight, they (by a kind of mocking and skorning of the enemy) did entertaine him and gaine time vpon him. Wherefore <hi>Muſtapha</hi> perceiuing, that all his endeuours were in vaine, and that there was ſmall hope to oppreſſe the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, hee had no deſire, to make any attempt againſt their fort, and as vnwilling was he to purſue them in their flight for feare of ambuſcadoes and ſuch like pollicies, which were vſuall and familiar with his enemy. Onelie with good aduiſe he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned and prouided good guardes and ſentinelles, and imployed the reſidue of his ſtrength and forces to waſt and ſpoile the countrey neare adioyning vnto him; till ſuch time as being enfourmed of the comming of the Prince of <hi>Albanie,</hi> hee reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the whole ſtrength and force of his armie, and went to encampe him ſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in litle leſſe then two myles of the enemie. The place which they made choiſe of<note place="margin">Oronochea.</note> for the battell, is called <hi>Oronochea,</hi> and is in the vpper <hi>Dibria,</hi> vppon a certaine faire plaine, yet of no great breadth, and about ſixe miles from <hi>Croie. Scanderbeg</hi> with his freſhe and new forces, were likewiſe entred into the Campe of the Epirots,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:13368:68"/>
where he was no ſooner arriued, but he cauſed proclamation to be made by the ſound of Trumpet, that no perſon ſhould iſſue foorth nor depart thence, without eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all leaue and licenſe: and immediatly he ſet euery man a worke about the fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Campe: <hi>Muſtapha</hi> in the meane while on his part not ſtirring nor mouing any whit at all. On both ſides therefore all was quiet and peaceable: by meanes whereof the <hi>Albanois</hi> hauing ſufficientlie ordered their affaires, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſtrengthned their armed forces, with ſtrong and well defenced rampiers: they began to fortifie likewiſe the fortreſſe with armes, men, and ſouldiours: and <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> making a generall view and muſter of his companies to know the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his men, and the certaintie of his forces: the old bandes were three thouſand and fiue hundred horſe, and ſix hundred foote ſtrong. For albeit <hi>Caſtriot</hi> had left there, little leſſe then fiue thouſand men at his departure (when he went to make prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the warre againſt the Venetians:) yet afterwardes he drew foorth a great many of them vpon diuers ſpeciall reaſons and good conſiderations: the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber therefore of their forces being reckoned and accounted then preſent, were neare<note place="margin">The number of Scanderbegs forces againſt Muſtapha.</note> about ſix thouſand fighting men, with whom hee purpoſed to affront the forces of <hi>Muſtapha</hi> and to hazard the fortune of that glorious triumph, and yet were not all of them employed: for the vigilancie and circumſpect prouidence of this pollitique chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, would not permit that his fort ſhould remaine naked and empty without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence (what ſoeuer chance ſhould betide him) but he ordained 300. choſen men for the<note place="margin">Order of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie againſt Muſtapha.</note> gard and cuſtodie of the ſame. His army very aduiſedly and vpon good conſideration did he deuide into wings: the fore front of the which, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſted altogether of horſemen, whom he made the chief force and ſtrength of both the battallions, placing in each of them a thouſand and fiue hundred horſe, for feare and doubt leaſt his footemen, (being vnable to indure and beare the charge of the enemies horſe,) ſhould at the firſt onſet be diſordered and ouerthrowen: and this was the cauſe that he placed but very fewe of them in the backe of his two winges: the greateſt part of his infanterie (being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in the middle battell, which was likewiſe couered and ſupported with fiue hundred horſe, to the intent the battell, being not troubled and diſordered at the very firſt encounter, on all partes, both on the one ſide and on the other,) the horſemen ſhould make head againſt the horſe of the enemy.</p>
            <p>Whileſt the Prince of <hi>Epire</hi> with the ſtrength and body of his armie, thus ordered and arranged, did containe his ſouldiers in great ſilence, and not ſtirring his enſignes, but attending the diſmarch and ſetting forward of the enemy: Behold a<note place="margin">The combat of Paule Mane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſey and Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſa.</note> certaine Turke, disbanding and ſeuering himſelfe from the reſt of his company, (whoſe name was <hi>Caraguſa</hi>) preſented himſelfe in the middle ſpace of the field, which lay betweene the two armies, and gaue a ſigne of defiance challenging ſome one of them to the combat: from thence aduancing him ſelfe neare to the ranckes of the Chriſtians, with a high and loftie voyce, he called for the moſt hardy and aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous perſon in all their companie, to aſſay him ſelfe againſt him body to body. At the firſt there was a generall ſilence, and no man gaue him a word, but euery one ſtood mute, as men who were, no leſſe doubtfull to refuſe the challenge for feare of ſhame and diſgrace: then to accept the combat, the hazard whereof was ſo daungerous: but <hi>Paule Maneſſey</hi> (who was knowen to bee a verie readie horſeman, and an excellent man at Armes) did not any longer tollerate theſe bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uadoes of the Barbarian againſt his nation and countrey-men: all the companies ſeeming to caſt their regard vppon him and to attend no other thing, as if hee eſpeciallie were the man, whom this challenge did concerne, and to whom the fortune of this fight did belong and appertaine: He therefore aduauncing
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:13368:68"/>
himſelfe roundly and in great fierceneſſe, with a ioyfull countenance went to ſeeke out <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> to know his mind and good pleaſure in the matter: of whom he was both verie highly commended: and his courage and good hope very much &amp; vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently augmented and animated by meanes of thoſe good ſpeeches which <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg</hi> gaue him: for he willed him in a good houre and vnder the true conduct of the<note place="margin">Paul Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſey encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by Scan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derbeg to the combat.</note> 
               <q>great God to march on, both to purchaſe to himſelfe particular praiſe and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, beſides immortall fame vnto his memorie: as alſo by the good and fortunate encounter of this ſo haughtie and memorable an act, to begin and lead the way vnto his companions to a glorious and happie victorie, leauing a worthy preſident for them to imitate, and which the whole armie in generall could not but follow with great ioy and gladneſſe, vpon the happie preſage of his new gained honor and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Hereupon thoſe of his own cornet flocking on all parts round about him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to praiſe,</q> to extoll and commend him, as if he had alreadie gotten the victorie. Then he making no longer ſtay, (but only whileſt he was arming &amp; furniſhing him ſelfe with ſuch things as were neceſſarie and ordinarie for the fight) ſuddenly moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on horſebacke, and forthwith gallopping into the open and plaine field, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing himſelfe towards the barbarian, (which there attended him) he called vnto him, and with an high voice, and wordes well fitting and beſeeming an enemie, he willed him to prepare and make him readie to the combat. The Turke bad him ſtay a litle, onely to giue him the hearing of a worde or two, which he deliuered in this manner.</p>
            <p>The victorie betweene vs, our valure and our fortune will decide and determine:<note place="margin">Speeches of Caraguſa to Paul Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſey.</note> 
               <q>but as touching the lawes of the victory, for that we our ſelues are to take ſome order: If ſo be the deſtinies haue ordeined thee this day to haue the honour of my loſſe and ouerthrow, I will not refuſe (being ouercome by right of armes) but thou ſhalt freely diſpoſe both of my ſlaughtered carkaſſe, and of theſe my ſpoiles: in like caſe, if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that thou be vanquiſhed and doeſt fall vnder mine hande, I will that the like right be done to me, to diſpoſe of thy bodie at my pleaſure. And this let our Generals ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie and confirme, for feare leaſt either in the heate and furie of our fight, or after the deciding and adiudging of the combat, ſome tumult and vproare doe ariſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene our battels, in fauour of the part of one of vs. Heereunto <hi>Paul</hi> gaue him this aunſwere: That for his part he did allow of the lawe and condition of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,<note place="margin">Anſwere of Paul Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſey to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raguſa.</note> which he (as it ſeemed) fearefully did demaund to be obſerued. For where the ſpirite reſolute and full of courage doth once yeelde to the others fortune, all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue by order of law and good right ought to be at the pleaſure of the conquerour. That he ſhould therfore fight ſecurely and without feare: that he needed not to doubt of anie other enemie beſides him, whoſe bodie (if it once became ghoſt leſſe vnder his hand) ſhould there alſo remaine to be diſpoſed of, at his free pleaſure and electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And albeit himſelfe could be content to bequeath the vnprofitable reliques of his dead carkaſſe amongſt his fellowe ſouldiers, to bewaile and lament his misfortune: that yet <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> would not ſuffer that thoſe members (which had ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſo faint and ſluggiſh in the combat as to be vanquiſhed) ſhould be brought backe and receiued into his campe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The audatious replie of this caualier, and the ſlight regard and account which he ſeemed to make of his life, did ſo appale and aſtoniſh the Barbarian, that it made him in a manner to repent himſelfe that euer he prouoked him. Imediatly the ſumme of their agreement being confirmed and ratified by the Chieftaines, and the two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batantes left alone in the middeſt of the fielde: euerie man had his eies fixed vppon them. Thoſe who were preſent at that fight, being diuerſely affected with doubt
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:13368:69"/>
and hope, did ſtand &amp; abide rauiſhed with a maruellous care concerning the ſucceſſe and euent of the combat: for in ſhew and tauleneſſe the two champions were neere alike. Both were of a meane ſtature, and of equall yeares and age, neither of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a ſlouthfull or heauie conſtitution, nor yet of too youthfull or ouerhot and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie a diſpoſition. Ech of their armes were alike: firſt their launces and their ſhields, which were barred all ouer the midſt with bars of ſteele: by their ſides they had cemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries after the Turkiſh faſhion, and great &amp; heauy maces of yron: their bodies were armed with curaſſes, and their heads with helmets. Ouer their armour they had verie rich caſſockes made of ſilke, ſhining very bright &amp; gliſtering: the which, albeit they did no way profite or further them to the victorie, yet did they adde a kind of grace and ornament vnto them. Both of them being thus appointed, and either of them bewraying a kinde of fierceneſſe and cruelty both in their countenance and courage, they tooke the field ech oppoſite againſt other, then ſetting ſpurres to their horſes, and fetching a ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g carreer (with their lances in the reſt to encounter ech other) the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian knight running at the head of the Paynim, ſtroke him aboue and ouer his ſhield<note place="margin">Paul Maneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey killeth Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raguſain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat.</note> into the right eye, and pierced the ſame quite through: with which wound, he tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ſaddle to the ground, the other diſmounting ſpeedily, diſarmed his dead carkaſſe, &amp; cut the head from his bodie: and thus loaden with the ſpoiles of his ſlaine enemie, he quickly mounted againe on horſebacke to returne to his fellow ſouldiers, who breaking forth on al ſides out of their ranks where they ſtood embattelled, with exceeding ioy and gratulations did conduct him towards their Generall. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> hauing receiued him with many gratious ſpeeches and infinite praiſes and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,<note place="margin">He is rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg.</note> euen there in the fields and in the preſence of the whole armie, did reward him with a rich cote of armes of gold tiſſue, and with a great demeſne and liuelihood in token of his vertue. Then for that the time did vrge him to beginne the battell and to commit the hazard of the fight to the greatneſſe of his fortune: he thought it good to encourage his ſouldiers, and thus he ſpake vnto them.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If the glorious actes and deedes of armes, do any thing moue the courages of men<note place="margin">Oration of Scanderbeg to his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</note> who are valiant and hardie: I do thinke (my good ſouldiers) that euery one of you is ſufficiently animated by this excellent teſtimonie of vertue in a particular priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: and the rather for that it ſeemeth the heauens could not haue afforded you a more notable example before your eies, nor haue giuen you a better occaſion to ſpurre and to prouoke you, then this happie beginning and theſe firſt frutes of victorie, which is ſufficient both to encourage you to a more braue and ſetled reſolution, and to abate and diſmay the courage of our enemies. Go you to therefore and paſſe on hardly in this path of honour, which hath bene troden out vnto you: and by a commendable kind of emulation, do you immitate the act of your fellow in armes, whoſe hands you may ſee yet ſmoking with the bloud of that infidell. The carefull regard &amp; diligence of your companion hath vowed it ſelfe for you, hath vowed it ſelfe for the victorie: his valiant and puiſſant arme hath offered vp a ſacrifice for you, that you likewiſe without any bloudſhed at all ſhould follow after him in the like, and (by the fauour of God) ſhould march ouer their bodies which are dedicated to deſtruction by your handes, and ſo you may enioy the ſpoiles which are promiſed to your valure and deſertes. Let vs therefore giue the onſet, and charge preſently vppon the enemie: he was the firſt to challenge you out of your rankes, let vs be the firſt to challenge him with our whole battell. Let vs force him into the field which ſeemeth to be fatall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, whileſt that feare and griefe haue depriued him of all ſtrength, and whilſt that a generall aſtoniſhment doth preſſe the hearts and minds of their people with a moſt ſad and ſorrowfull ſilence.</q>

            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:13368:69"/>Aſſoone as he had thus ſpoken (their bodies hauing beene before refreſhed) about the ſeuenth houre he cauſed the trumpet to ſound, and in the verie inſtant he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched forwarde in battell array. Behold a notable and wonderfull kinde of hardineſſe in this man: marke well his reſolution moſt worthie of an inuincible vertue, and deſeruing to be admired of all poſteritie. This Chiefetaine (the onely fine ſouldier of his time) with ſo ſmall a troupe of men, brauely diſdayning the great forces and mightie puiſſance of his enemie, durſt in open and plaine fielde with armie againſt armie, aduenture the hazarde of ſo great and doubtfull a battell: not ſeeking by the helpe or furtherance of anie politicall inuention, or of anie martiall deuiſe and ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageme, to ouerreach and circumuent his enemie he had the courage and audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to be the firſt that ſhould forgoe his trenches, and putting himſelfe vpon the field, to giue the brauado to ſo ſtrong an enemie: whom (as if he had bene vnready or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to come on, or as one readie to flie awaie) he ſeemed to force and compell forth to the conflict. In this maner with a maruellous clamor and mightie crie (made by his ſouldiers) he now beganne to aduance himſelfe towardes the fort of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: but that <hi>Muſtapha</hi> came forth to meete and encounter him, at firſt with a ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron<note place="margin">The battell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg.</note> tumultuouſly aſſembled, and afterwardes with all his forces. But like as in feare and terrour they did ſet forwarde, ſo were they aſſoone and eaſily repulſed at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie firſt onſet, and ſcarce were they all come foorth of their trenches, and placed in good order of battell, but that manie of them ſuddenly betaking themſelues to flight, did flocke backe againe in troupes, making haſt to get within their fort, moſt baſely and cowardly ſeeking to fence and warrant their liues with the ſtrength of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe and rampiers. Which thing being perceiued by the Turkiſh generall, and that neither the enſignes nor the ſouldiers did keepe their ſtande, nor any order; to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent he might the better encourage them by the regard and example of his owne for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes, he cried vnto them to follow him, and where they ſhould ſee him to make way, there the enſignes ſhould follow and come after him. And therewithall bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelfe cloſe with his lance in the reſt, he broched his horſe with his ſpurres, and with head and ſhoulders gaue in vpon the front of the enemy with a full &amp; firme reſolution, either to carie away the victorie vnto <hi>Amurath</hi> his lorde and maiſter, or elſe to ſell his life dearely. Many of his leaders and captaines followed him, and a good number of his owne battallion: and the reſidue alſo beeing aſhamed to leaue their Chiefetaine in time of neede, by little and little came to ioyne with him, and oppoſed themſelues to the force and violence of the Chriſtians: ſo that in diuerſe and ſundriie places gathering and trouping together, they did maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the fight to the vttermoſt of their powers. Thus on all ſides were the battels reenforced, and the fight beganne ſpeedily to be renewed, yet was there not anie appearance of the change and varietie of fortune both to the one partie and to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as is commonly ſeene in ſuch fights) but alwaies and on all partes a like, were the infidels without any hope of victorie, the Chriſtians euer ſurmounting them by the continual encreaſe and proceedings of their good fortune: ſo firmely had the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of the two firſt champions from the verie beginning, wrought and confirmed the fortune of both the armies, and had engrauen in the mind of ech man ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of hope or terror, that it made them either fearefull or aduenturous. <hi>Moſes</hi> from his ſide, ſometimes aduancing &amp; ſetting forward with his horſe, and ſometimes bringing on his footemen againſt the Turkiſh enſignes, did ſo diſorder them, that he eaſily broke in vpon them with great force &amp; violence. They on the contrary ſide, who were oppoſed againſt him being vanquiſhed, rather by a certaine fatall deſtinie, then by any valure &amp; prowes of the Chriſtians, and being ſcant able to ſhun &amp; auoide
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:13368:70"/>
the blowes and wounds which were giuen them did ſeeme as men in bonds &amp; alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die vanquiſhed, rather then fit to bind and vanquiſh others. <hi>Paul Maneſſey</hi> fighting in the middle battell beſtirred himſelfe notably, leauing after him whereſoeuer he went a maruellous ſlaughter of the circumciſed. By this time were their rankes broken on all ſides, neither horſemen nor footemen continuing in fight, or keeping their place in battell array: but all being confuſed and mingled one with another, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part well neere, of the Turkes hauing their horſes ſlaine by the footmen <hi>Albanois,</hi> with their lances in their handes, came to ſerue as footemen alſo: but on the one ſide, their bodies being vnaccuſtomed and not vſed to fight on foot: and on the other part the diſcommoditie of their armour being great, did much endammage and hinder them. And by reaſon that their own forces did more &amp; more decreaſe and diminiſh, they imagined that our numbers did multiplie and increaſe; neuertheleſſe, being blinded with ſhame, they did ſtill abide expecting and attending the ſucceſſe of their Generall, who on the other ſide was as buſily occupied. For he (being accompanied or aſſiſted with all the moſt notable &amp; valiant men of his armie, &amp; hauing made head againſt the middle battell where <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> himſelfe remained) did thinke to haue repaired the forme and good hap of all the reſt of the ſquadrons. Sometimes the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of <hi>Paul Maneſſey</hi> did greatly vrge them, for that by the glorious and honorable opinion, which they had in their champion lately ſlaine, their fearefull thoughts and cogitations, did meaſure all things in their enemie, to be greater then they made ſhew of: ſometimes againe their hearts were incenſed and inflamed with wrath, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as either the deformed image of their ſlaine champion, or the ſhadowe of his dead bodie vnreuenged, did ſeeme to appeare before their eyes, and to preſent it ſelfe to their remembrance. Moreouer the great rewardes and recompences (which was the greateſt and chiefeſt inuitement to pricke them forwarde) propoſed and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Muſtapha</hi> to him that could kill this enemie (whom they hated grieuouſlie) did encourage his people to be the more deſirous and forwarde to endaunger them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues:<note place="margin">Paul Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſey aſſailed by the Turkes.</note> by meanes whereof, manie being reallied and aſſembled in troupes about <hi>Paul</hi> alone, they preſſed vpon him to the vttermoſt of their powers, and as men that cared not for anie of the reſt, him onelie did they ayme and ſhoote at. There was not anie one of them but did ſtriue, euen with the hazard of his owne life, and with deadly wounds to purchaſe the pretious reward of that head which was ſo highly prized. But the obſtinate proweſſe of this Cauilier, cauſed the fonde and fooliſh deſire of the Turkes, to turne to their owne pernitious and extreame dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage. For being well garded with a troupe of ſuch as were moſt hardie and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, he was able enough to ſuſtaine their furie and violence, and to contemne their vaine preſumptions. At length perceiuing a farre off, that one of the Barbarians had disbanded himſelfe from the reſt of his troupes, and was verie hotte and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate vppon thoſe of his companie, he turned himſelfe towardes him, without anie word ſpeaking: and hauing gotten neere vnto him, he diſcharged ſo full a blow with all his ſtrength ouerthwart his head, and redoubled one or two ſtrokes vppon him, that he ouerthrew him headlong off his horſe, making him to take the meaſure of his tombe vpon the hard earth. When his champions ſawe him lie dead vpon the ground, they beganne preſently to turne the bridle, neither caring to reuenge his death, nor to warrant his body fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the outrage of the enemy. This made the Epirots (when they ſaw them to ſtande as it were in a ſtudie, and certaine of them flying) to preſſe vpon them the more fiercely, and to charge them with the greater fury, giuing them no time to breath, but handled them rudely, till hauing them in full chaſe, they left all the aduantage &amp; honor to the conquerors. <hi>Paul</hi> purſuing them ſtill as they fled,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:13368:70"/>
did gleane and take vp ſome of them that made leaſt ſpeed, and with bitter and biting termes, he thus tauntingly exclaimed vpon them. Whether flie you (ſaied he) you<note place="margin">Speeches of Paul Maneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey to the Turks as they fled.</note> baſe companions, are you ſo forgetfull of all good fellowſhip: hath not <hi>Caraguſa</hi> here, neither brother, coſin, nor ſo much as a friende, amongeſt ſo many of you: who in honour of his corps (that lieth here dead and disfigured) will vouchſafe to reuenge <q>him, which is the laſt good you can do him, being paſt all your aide and helping?

            </p>
            <p>But the Turkes (more mute and dombe then fiſhes) had minde of nothing but of ſpeedie fight and running away: and with an infamous kinde of ſilence, did neither approue nor reproue the tauntes and reprochfull ſpeeches of the enemie. And thus within a while, hauing by litle and litle gotten the aduantage and libertie of the open field, they did quickely vaniſh out of ſight, ſo as hardly could they heare the ſound or noyſe of thoſe that chaſed them: onely the archers did trouble them with great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacie: as for the reſt of the troupes, they abſtained from purſuing them, becauſe wearineſſe and extremitie of trauell had dulled both the force and the ſpirits of the<note place="margin">The dewſe of the Turkes in their enſignes.</note> Chriſtians. Notwithſtanding hauing gathered vp the enſignes &amp; half moones, which lay euery where diſperſed ouer the field (for the Turks in their ſtandards &amp; enſignes doe beare this for their deuiſe) the ſouldiees with wonderfull great ioyes making the aire to reſound, &amp; with their pleaſant clamors, and rude riming ſongs, did euen ſtriue and contend who ſhould carie them to the tents of <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi> For all had gone well on that ſide a good while before: and the Turkes being either ſlaine, did lie diſperſed ouer the fielde in great heapes, or being reſerued (according to the right of armes) with their hands faſt pinioned behinde their backes, did giue euident and open teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of their owne bad deuoire, and the clemencie of their enemies. <hi>Muſtapha</hi>

For the pernitious humor of ambition, and a peſtilent deſire to purchaſe vnto himſelfe the greater glorie, by the proofe and triall of his reſolution, had caried him furiouſly into the ſquadron of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> where (being encloſed and deſtitute of all aide &amp; defence of his ſouldiers, and of all the meanes, either to eſcape away free, or die honourablie) the vnfortunate Chieftaine made choiſe to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pound with the loſſe of al other things, yea and of his libertie alſo, for the ſauegard and preſeruation of his life onely.</p>
            <p>I can not ſay certainly, whether in all the time of the warre held with <hi>Amurath,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The victory of the Chriſtians.</note> there were any exploit atchieued more notable, or more fauored by the diuine power then this: So worthily did this iorney make ſhew of euery man his good courage and deſert: neuer was there any leader nor any ſouldier, nor any other perſon of what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree ſoeuer, that did euer returne more honorably charged with reputation and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, either in publique, or in priuate. The report is, that there were ſlaine of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie 10000. And that there were taken onely 82. priſoners, and 15. ſtandardes. This happie and fortunate ouerthrow, coſt not the <hi>Albanois</hi> much bloudſhed, for he loſt (as they ſay) ſcarce 300. men. The campe of the enemy did greatly enrich the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſouldiers, for that the Turkes, who had ſoiourned certaine monthes vppon the marches &amp; borders of the prouince, had gotten together &amp; purchaſed good ſtore of pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:13368:71"/>
and a notable number of good horſes: but albeit the ſouldiers helde themſelues rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonablie well ſatisfied with pillage, yet for all that, was not the wrathfull and fierie courage of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> ſufficiently appeaſed: but that immediately and aſſoone as he had refreſhed his troupes, that part of the day which remained, he ſpent and imploied it in ſacking and ſpoyling the territories of the enemie. And in this ſort continuing the courſe of his late victorie, ſetting fire on all things both farre &amp; neere: that which could not be deſtroied by the ſworde, was burnt and conſumed by fire. Neither did the very meaneſt or worſt ſort of the ſouldiers, returne from thence empty and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bootie: for wherſoeuer they found any thing good and worth the taking, they forgot it not behind them. And beſides, they brought away a wonderfull manie of beaſts and cattell: ſo that, what with the wearineſſe of their exceſſiue trauell, &amp; what with the abundance of their bootie (wherewith they were ouer charged) ſcarcely could they get home to their campe, before an houre within night. The reſidue of the night was ſpent in taking their reſt, which they paſſed very ſtill and in great qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe, without any bonfires, without any noiſe and clamors, or any other ſhewes or tokens of their victorie: and the reaſon was, for that the Prince of <hi>Epyre</hi> ſhewed him ſelfe more ſad and penſiue then he was accuſtomed, becauſe of the newes that <hi>Baleze</hi> was ouerthrowen and raſed. Therefore all thoſe within the campe (who were any<note place="margin">Scanderbeg is penſiue for the razing of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leze.</note> thing diſcreetely and ſoberly diſpoſed) framing their countenances altogether to ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and melancholie, did conforme themſelues to the ſame humour ioyntly with him: ſometimes confirming him with good and pleaſing ſpeeches, and ſometimes raging with hatred and mallice againſt the enemie. But the agreeued thoughts &amp; pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue imaginations of this Prince would admit no comfort nor accuſtomed reſt ſo long and ſo often as he called to remembrance the outrage and ingratitude of the Scutari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, in regard of the benefites and clemencie which they had taſted and receiued from him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> therefore hauing appointed and left (according to his cuſtome) two thouſand horſe, and a thouſand foote for the gard of the frontiers: the next morning<note place="margin">Scanderbeg ſpoileth the territorie of the Scutarians in reuenge of the razing of Baleze.</note> by the breake of daye he departed with the reſidue of his forces; (taking with him both the priſoners, and wellneare all the beſt and choiſeſt of the bootie,) and ſo tooke his way to the ſiege of <hi>Dayna:</hi> where when he had learned by <hi>Marin Span</hi> more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely and particularly how all things had paſſed, he made no longer abode, then whileſt he renewed and repaired his troups: and then immediately and without delay with freſh forces (which caried with them the extreame loſſe and calamitie of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Scutarie</hi>) he paſſed ouer the riuer of <hi>Drynon:</hi> and diſperſing his horſmen ouer all the countrey; whatſoeuer he found tilled and ſowen in any place or quarter (for it was in the end of autumne,) all was deſtroied, waſted and ſpoiled: the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yardes cut vp cloſe by the ground, and moſt of their trees that bare frute were felled downe: the peſants and ruſtickes themſelues were not ſaued from ſlaughter, but as many of them as were found to reſiſt againſt the enemie, were put to the ſword, and the reſidew were ſacked and euill entreated. From thence turning his furie vpon the other townes of the Venetian territorie, he purſued them in ſuch ſorte that they had good cauſe giuen them, to curſe that raſh exploite of the Scutarians againſt <hi>Baleze.</hi> Moſt of the inhabitants and al the forces which remained within the countrie did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolt and adioine themſelues and take part with <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> rather then they would taſte of the rigor and diſcommoditie of ſuch ruines and deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> did largely blame and reprehende the immoderate choller of his Nephewe, but he could not acknowledge the infirmitie of his owne paſſion. He deteſted the indiſcretion of a young courage, but he could not temperate
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:13368:71"/>
and moderate his owne anger and impaciencie. The countrie being thus ouercome, made deſolate and brought vnder the dominion of a ſtrange lord, he now alſo began to growe terrible to the townes and places of chiefe regard. Notwithſtanding the extremitie and rigor of the cold winter now beginning to approch, and the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall falling of the raine without ceaſing, did driue him home againe againſt his wil, and made him retire into his tents to winter vnder the wonted walles of <hi>Dayna.</hi> Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring theſe troubles and alterations, the gouernours of the Venetian prouince, and the magiſtrates of <hi>Scutarie,</hi> being by meanes hereof in maruellous diſtreſſe and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, (but eſpecially in regard of theſe forces which were ſhut vp within <hi>Dayna,</hi> whom they well knew to haue beene brought to the laſt point and extremitie of want and neceſſitie) diſpatched letters to the Senate of <hi>Venice,</hi> containing the miſerable eſtate of their confederates.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time there arriued into the campe, certen infidels with great and<note place="margin">Muſtapha &amp; the other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners ranſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for 25000 Ducketes.</note> rich preſents vnto <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> for the ranſome of his priſoners: and they agreed vpon the payment of fiue and twentie thouſand Duckates. Thereupon was <hi>Muſtapha</hi> and all his companions deliuered: and the Turkes (hauing bene bountifully feaſted, and entertained verie honorably, (as if all rancour and enmitie had bene vtterly forgotten and layed aſide:) had guides appointed them (ſuch as were verie skilfull in all the paſſages of the countrey,) both for their ſafe conueiance and better aſſurance on the way againſt the violence of the Chriſtians. The money leuied and made by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerie, was wholly diſtributed amongſt the ſouldiers by <hi>Scanderbeg:</hi> his deſire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they ſhould be made partakers of the reward, who had bene partakers of the trauels &amp; danger of the warre. Al this while there was not any attempt made againſt the towne by reaſon that the rigour of the colde and froſtes, did not permit them thereunto. The defendants hauing abandoned the care and remembrance of al things,<note place="margin">The conſtancie of the Dayni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> ſaue of their faith and fidelity only, did abate nothing of their former wilfulnes &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacie. Many and infinite diſcommodities had waſted and conſumed their forces, but yet they reſerued ſtill one and the ſame minde and courage, and their ſpirites did ſeeme daily to waxe more liuely and reſolute though their bodies were greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled and their ſtrength much abated and diminiſhed. Thus did a ſmall Hamlet ſtaie the force and violence of a moſt excellent and ſoueraigne Chiefetaine: and he that was a conquerour inuincible in ſo manie famous battelles, ſawe himſelfe ſurmounted by the conſtancie of that place onely. Yet did not the ſhame hereof, neuertheleſſe any whit deterre <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> from purſuing his attempt: but he was the more reſolutely determined to winne them by famine if he could not otherwiſe bring them to reaſon. There were at this time certen ſecret ſpeeches, and vncertaine rumors amongſt the common ſort: that the Seigniorie of <hi>Venice</hi> was verie willing<note place="margin">A treatie of peace betwene Scanderbeg &amp; the Venetians.</note> and enclining to a peace, by reaſon whereof, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> bare himſelfe more mildly and gratious towardes the enemie: and in thoſe roades and incurſions which were made thenceforth vppon the countrie, the <hi>Albanois</hi> did diſcharge their choller and mallice with more gentleneſſe and leſſe extremitie. Not many daies were paſt, but that newes were brought of certaine Ambaſſadors ſent vnto him by the order &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Senate at <hi>Venice,</hi> to entreat a newe agreement of peace and amitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, and the time of their comming was hourely expected. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> therefore (according to the vſage and cuſtome of great perſonages) hauing ſent the chiefe of his nobilitie with a great traine to meete them, entertayned them moſt honorably: and hauing feaſted them in verie ſumptuous and bountifull manner, the<note place="margin">Conditions of peace offered to Scanderbeg.</note> next day he gaue them full audience to deliuer their charge and commiſſion. The effect whereof was this, That the Prince of <hi>Epire</hi> ſhould breake vp his campe before

            <p>My hartie wiſh and deſire is, that that prince were yet liuing amongeſt vs, whoſe death was the beginning and firſt occaſion, both of my iuſt griefe, and of theſe weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome warres which I haue had with you: for whileſt I ſought to recouer from you the poſſeſſion of <hi>Dayna,</hi> ſtayned with the blood of our Citizens, by the miſhap of an vniuſt warre: I would not at this time haue ſeene this prouince of Chriſtians and of our friendes and allies to be ouerwhelmed with ſo many miſchieues: but I would <q>haue gloried in the obſeruation of peace and amitie inuiolably with that moſt hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and worthie Senate, the interruption and troubling whereof at this preſent, (happening vpon ſo ſmall, and trifling a cauſe) my hart will not of a long time but greatly grieue at. But this breach and debate grew vpon another occaſion: for your taking of armes is to be excuſed, in that the diſloialtie of others by their ſiniſter and peruerſe counſels, did eaſily eſtrange and alienate from me the hart and good affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that * Ladie, and moſt malitiouſly and with a certaine affectation of flatterie, did<note place="margin">Boſſa.</note> conceale that which was agreed betweene <hi>Lech</hi> and me, and were the authors that <hi>Dayna</hi> did yeeld it ſelfe into your protection. It was not you therefore with whom I found my ſelfe ſo much agreeued, neither did I take armes to conuince you of iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, nor yet to impute anie ambition or greedie deſire of Empire vnto the Venetians, whom as yet, no age did euer heare to haue enterpriſed or authoriſed any warre, that was vniuſt and againſt equitie. But one thing there was which did not a litle diſpleaſe me, that you had leſſe truſt and affiance in me then was requiſite: and whileſt you gaue care, and builded vpon their tales and reportes, you thought me to be ambitious, and to be led with a deſire of trouble and contention. I therefore (ſeeing that right was not to be had but by armes onely, did lay hold vpon this occaſion of the warre, which was in a manner, caſt vpon me, and euen as it were put into my handes. But now moſt gladly doe I laie aſide my weapons (God himſelfe being willing to haue it ſo) &amp; more then that (if your ſelues had not required it) euen this territorie which by the ordinance of the Senate you haue giuen me in recompence of <hi>Dayna,</hi> and for the confirmation of this our league and amitie, holding my ſelfe well ſatisfied one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the good will and francke offer of your Senate, and doe willingly embrace the good will and friendſhippe of thoſe liberall and magnificent princes. As for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other thing I neither deſire nor accept of: but (if occaſion ſerue, and neede be,) all this territorie which I haue, my whole eſtate, and my goods and ſubſtance, yea my very life, will I vow and conſecrate for you,</q> for your children, and for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie<note place="margin">Peace pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Venetiant and Scanderbeg.</note> of your Empire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> hauing finiſhed his ſpeech, tooke order that Heraulds ſhould be ſent throughout all the Prouince, to publiſh vnto the people the glad tydings and ioyfull
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:13368:72"/>
newes of this peace ſo much deſired: the ſiege alſo was broken vp and raiſed, and the ſconces and other fortifications made during the ſiege were beaten downe and razed: the ſouldiers in all mirth and ioy (laying aſide all hatred and malice both in publique and in priuate) did friendly entertaine and welcome thoſe of the towne, and did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite them into their tentes and pauillions. Immediately alſo vpon this treatie <hi>Andrew</hi> and <hi>Volcathagne,</hi> were deliuered and permitted to goe at large where they thought good: all other things which had bene lately taken from the Scutarians and their neighbours: as villages, caſtels, fortreſſes and ſuch like, they were rendred and rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered to the ambaſſadors. The day following (after many triumphes, and many goodly ſhewes (as the manner is publiquely had and ſolemnized) the Ambaſſadors were diſmiſſed, but not without many rich and ſumptuous preſents.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> being naturally of a liuely and ſtirring diſpoſition, (and being<note place="margin">Scanderbeg leauing the ſiege of Daina marcheth to the ſpoile of the Turkiſh territorie.</note> impatient of reſt, and not able to endure idlenes) preſently he led his troupes to the Turkiſh frontiers: with intent to waſt and ſpoile them, as he was vſually accuſtomed: where gathering in one the olde garriſon and the reſt of his companies, with both incorporated together, he ſeemed to haue a good and faire armie: in ſuch ſort that a man would haue thought thoſe forces ſufficient, not onely to pill and ſpoile the fields, but to enterpriſe, vndertake and execute ſome great and notable good peece of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, ſo cheerefully and contentedly did ech of them follow on, to receiue the deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued pay and ſtipend of their long ſeruice and warfare. For in thoſe daies the ſouldiers did not expect nor demaunde any other wages of their Generall then what they could get and purchaſe vpon the enemie by the ſword and force of armes. Hereof it grewe that the Princes (his neighbours) were wont (in way of mirth and ieſt) to call<note place="margin">The Turkiſh territory Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbegs treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> the territorie of the enemie, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> his treaſurie. Afterwardes parting his hoaſt into three ſeuerall troups, he entred on all ſides vpon the borders of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> where he ſpent two whole daies in ouerrunning, pilling, and harrying of the countrey: the ſouldiers being their owne pay maiſters for their paines, at the coſt and charges of the inhabitants: who went not ſcotfree without the loſſe of their liues, except ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baptized were become Chriſtians: and to thoſe alſo they left nothing, nor ſhewed them any other fauor, but gaue them their liues and their libertie. After the furie of the ſword, followed the rage of flame and fire; which being kindled in the houſes, did deforme and diſfigure all things, and burned all into aſhes in ſuch ſort that if the campe of <hi>Amurath</hi> had happened at that time to haue come into <hi>Epire;</hi> there was no hope for it to haue found any victuals to haue maintained them, ſo much as one day, except they had caried and brought it with them. The earth therefore being left all bare, naked and emptie, with the onely ſhew and markes of deſolation: <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> cauſed his enſignes to march homewards, &amp; retired his armie within his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines. Then did he licenſe his ſouldiers to depart, and ſent them home to their owne houſes, after he had highly praiſed &amp; commended the diligence of euerie one of them, excepting the number of three thouſand onely; which (being the ordinarie garriſon appointed for the defence of the borders) did alwaies continue there, and neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued from that place: himſelfe with the reſidue of his citizens and his ordinarie gard, did take the way directly towards <hi>Croy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tidings being brought to the Venetians of the peace concluded in <hi>Epire,</hi> and of the bountie of the Prince of <hi>Albanie,</hi> and the Ambaſſadors giuing him high praiſe and commendation: the Senate conceiued exceeding ioy, and an incomparable gladnes: for that their prouince (after ſo long and fierce a warre) might from thenceforth take breath and reſt themſelues. Then being willing to honor the vertue and magnificence of that Prince, with ſome ſhew and argument of their thankefull hartes, in a generall
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:13368:73"/>
counſell of all the citizens and gentlemen of that eſtate, by a common and publique<note place="margin">Scanderbeg &amp; hupoſteritie made free of the citie of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant generall of the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian territories in Epire.

            <p>All this while there was nothing ſpoken of the Turkes, neither was it heard that they made anie roads or ordinarie inuaſions, or that they attempted any thing vpon the Epirots. For the rude diſcomfiture and ouerthrow of <hi>Muſtapha</hi> had ſo terrified and abated their courage, that <hi>Amurath</hi> durſt not ſtirre any further againſt the Duke of <hi>Albanie,</hi> fearing by ſuch like enterpriſes (as he had formerly and vſually aſſailed him) he ſhould rather augment and ſtrengthen his forces, then be able either to breake or to diminiſh them: ſeeing that ſo many and ſo great armies, (which euen till then had entred <hi>Epyre</hi> for the inuaſion of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi>) were for the moſt part either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied, and left dead vpon the fields: or elſe ſhamefully diſcomfited and put to flight, or being brought into ſeruitude and captiuitie, did ſerue but as laughing ſlockes for their enemies to triumph ouer, and a fit matter for the encreaſe of their glorie and reputation. Suppoſing therefore that to be once reuenged of theſe diſgraces it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to make farre greater preparations, and to march againſt him with another ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of puiſſance, he ſpent whole houres and daies in diuerſe conſultations, ſtill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing the occaſion of that great honour which he had vainely conceiued, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to himſelfe by ſuch a iorney. But the report of the peace made with the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and the ſpoiling of his Prouinces, and ſo many diſcomfitures, one happening in the necke of another, comming to his eares, his heart being before mightily addicted and inclined to warre, was now much more incenſed and more ſharply pricked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Wherefore the old man (being thus full of care and thoughts) before he would decree any thing for the leuying of ſouldiers; cauſed certaine who were neareſt his perſon to be ſent for (whom they call <hi>Viſiers,</hi> and are thoſe of his priuie councell) to<note place="margin">Viſiers the Councellours of the great Turk</note> whom, as one mad for verie anger, and full of furie and choller, he diſcouered in the end, the ſecret and long conceiued hatred of his hart in theſe termes.</p>

               <q>Hitherto (moſt worthy and truſtie Councellours) we haue both well nouriſhed &amp;<note place="margin">Orat on of Amurath to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours for the warre to be vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againſt Scanderbeg</note> much augmented the proſperous temeritie of this fugitiue: and being occupied with the vrgent neceſſitie of the warre of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> we haue ſo long deferred the due pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of this our hate full enemie, that by the multitude of outrages and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelious abuſes, he hath freely and without chaſticement, incenſed the maieſtie of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire; ſuch as neither my eares can endure to heare reported, nor my eyes can abide the ſight of. His fierce and furious madneſſe, (I ſhame to ſpeake it) is encreaſed ſo farre and is growne to that paſſe, that he dareth with all his forces, to be aforehand with vs, in aſſaulting vs: and openly to condemne vs of faintneſſe and want of courage. What auaileth it heere to recount vnto you the miſfortune of <hi>Haly</hi> Baſſa? and the like miſchances of ſo many other Captaines and leaders? we neede goe no further to take a view and coniecture of the image of our eſtate, but onely by the miſerable prouince of <hi>Macedon,</hi> which (as I vnderſtand) by continuall roades, inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and burnings is brought to that extreamitie, that from henceforth we haue lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hope left to ſee therein any markes or tokens that it is our prouince, but filled ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and repleniſhed with our enemies: for euen of late did he enter it with an armie leauied of purpoſe, ſpending whole daies in the ſpoiling and diſpeopling of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. How long ſhall we endure the attemptes of this wicked and ſeditious wretch? ſhall we ſuffer him ſo long till we our ſelues be fettered, and that he put irons vpon
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:13368:73"/>
our owne legs: it is high time that wee ſuppreſſe his pernitious endeuors; for feare leaſt by our negligence, this fire do increaſe: and then all too late (which my mind miſgiueth me) we do begin to frame our complaints, and ſeeke remedie all in vaine: conſidering that an enemie being once contemned and neglected, of a ſmall and meane beginning manie times doth amplifie and enlarge his forces, and lifteth vp his<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> head to the ruine of his aduerſarie. All things (my maſters) doe inuite you to the warres,, and do ſeeme to miniſter the meanes vnto you: for if there were no other reaſon to induce vs thereunto, yet neuertheleſſe, the onely regard and lamentable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the miſeries and calamities of our ſubiects, were not that alone ſufficient to ſolicite the courages of men braue and valiant? The daylie captiuities and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſo many our friends, the ſmoke of our townes and vilages on all ſides fiered and burnt (which do euen call and crie in themſelues for a reuenge) would they not make vs euen to bluſh for verie ſhame if we ſhould ſuffer them? Haue we ſo often heretofore reſtrained and repreſſed the rage of the Hungarians? haue we by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and memorable defaits, left <hi>Greece</hi> mourning in her owne ſorrowes &amp; laments? haue we broken the forces of ſo many mighty and redoubted potentates &amp; brought them euen to naught? and ſhall we now ſuffer (through a timerous kind of puſilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimitie) theſe troubles and tumults of <hi>Epire,</hi> to gather ſtrength and to encreaſe vpon vs? ſhall we yet endure to ſee that prouince (which of late was tributarie vnto vs) now to ſtand in contention and to braue vs by armes? what? hath the land of <hi>Albanie</hi> ſo ſuddenly of late engendred another ſort of Epirots? and is it poſſible that a new &amp; vnaccuſtomed kind of enemie ſhould iſſue forth vnexpected againſt vs? I am deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined once againe, to make triall if this nation be ſo fierce and vntameable: and if the hardie and haughtie courage of their obſtinate and proud Prince can be brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the accuſtomed yoke of their ſubiection. We muſt not from henceforth ſtand vpon points of ſubtiltie and vaine pollicies; nor muſt we any more ſeeke to ſurprize this enemie by ambuſhments: neither doth the time now ſerue (by the diuerſitie of the Leaders and Chieftaines and by ordinarie troupes one after another) to fill their hatefull ſoile with the blood of our ſouldiers: for we ſee that one and the ſame kind of miſfortune doth follow both our leaders and our armies: and whereas we made choiſe of them to do vs ſeruice, they haue ſerued to endammage rather our ſelues the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our enemies. Shall we commit another armie to <hi>Haly</hi> Baſſa, or <hi>Feriſey,</hi> who beſides the wounds and the deformed reliques of their owne forces, haue brought vs not ſo much as one ſtandard or enſigne of the enemies? Shall we follow the vnfortunate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe and counſelles of <hi>Muſtapha:</hi> and miniſter paye vnto the Chriſtians, and eaſe their charge in the maintaining of their forces: while he is caried onely with a deſire to extinguiſh and free the infamie of his bonds and impriſonment? We haue bene ſo often vanquiſhed, taken priſoners, ranſomed: and in briefe ſo often beaten and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited, that we haue reaſon from henceforth to abhorre, and to be aſhamed of our owne eſtate and condition: we muſt now therefore take vpon vs the charge of this warre, with our beſt meanes and the vtter moſt of our endeuors. It behooueth vs to vndertake it with ſuch forces, to employ ſo great a puiſſance, and to march into <hi>Epire</hi> with ſo mightie an hoaſt; that the countrey may be ſcant able to containe it, nor yet to ſuſtaine the force and violence of our armie. By this meanes without any loſſe or bloodſhed, ſhall we purge and clenſe all the countrey: and by a notable diſcomfiture of our enemies (being either expelled and chaſed quite away, or vtterlieſubdued and vanquiſhed) we ſhall reeſtabliſh thoſe townes in their auncient forme and faſhion: which by the diſloialtie of this fierce nation, hath bene withheld from vs: or if the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe obſtinacie and obdurate ſtubborneſſe of this people (as it is likely &amp; vſuall with
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:13368:74"/>
them) vpon a raſh and deſperate reſolution, and of an inconſiderate deſire to defende their Prince, do betake themſelues to armes: we will then vtterly deſtroy theſe wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ſoules (who do euen long for their deſerued puniſhment) and with a ſingular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge (which we haue ſo long deſired) we will recompence them for the old wrongs and iniuries which they haue done vs, both in publique and in priuate. It is your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (valiant and worthie men) to vndertake this warre, not as you were wont to doe againſt the Hungarians, or other enemies: but with a farre greater wrath and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as againſt thoſe which are your ſlaues and fugitiues, and who (being moſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieuouſly affected againſt you) haue now made ſhewe of their inſolent and hatefull mindes, which for a long time lay cloſe concealed and diſſembled.</q>

For the winter beginning now to waxe more milde, the tops of the mountains coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſnow, began to ſhew forth and to be diſcouered. Immediatly therefore, and without anie delay, commiſſions were directed, and proclamations made through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the Prouinces and Nations vnder the Turkiſh obeiſance, and throughout all the Realmes of his allies and confederates, and to ſuch cities and townes by name, as the <hi>Sultan</hi> thought conuenient<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that they ſhould furniſh him with ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of horſe and foote to be readie with all ſpeede, and to repaire vnto him to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinople:</hi> for as yet had not <hi>Greece</hi> loſt the feate of her noble and famous Emperors at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> neither had ſhe at that time cauſe to mourne and lament their dolefull funerals; happening afterwards at ſuch time as they came to be buried and throwen downe vnder the yoke and ſubiection of the miſcreants. The rumor of theſe prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and huge prouiſions brought with it great feare and terror to the neighbour na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and adioyning townes of the Chriſtians: who being ſurprized with notable aſtoniſhment, were in wonderfull great doubt, where and vppon what place the<note place="margin">Secreſie of the Turke in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing his counſels.</note> burthen of this warre, and the extreame puiſſance of ſo great forces would powre forth and execute their bloodie effects. For hardly was any man able to coniecture of the ſecret counſels of <hi>Amurath:</hi> not his owne inward and moſt priuate fauorites, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept certen of his councellors, in whom (as we haue ſaid) the <hi>Ottoman</hi> had a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all truſt and aſſurance: for feare leaſt the enemies, being thereof aduertiſed, might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide themſelues both of counſell and meanes to repulſe the violence of his attemptes. This putteth me in remembrance how in that firſt expedition of the Turkes againſt <hi>Scutarie,</hi> the Barbarians were diſcouered and ſeene before our walles in a manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we hearde any thing of their arriuall. But in truth it is a policie verie ordinary and vſuall with this warlike nation; to giue out a lying and falſe rumor of ſome vaine tumult and attempt one way; whileſt they do bend their forces, &amp; conuert the whole<note place="margin">The policie of the Turkes to oppreſſe the Chriſtians.</note> puiſſance of their redoubted armes another way: to the intent they may the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſurprize &amp; oppreſſe thoſe, who (being leaſt aduiſed) are caried away with a vaine kind of light beleefe and pernitious credulitie. But the fame and ſuſpition of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations cauſed a generall allarme and tumult on all parts: on the one ſide the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians miſtruſting the infidelitie of their perpetuall aduerſarie, began to betake them to their armes which they had found ſo vnfortunate: and to raiſe their forces which
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:13368:74"/>
were ſore weakned by ſo many diſcomfitures and ouerthrowes. On the other ſide, the Greekes being in extreame diſtreſſe, and hauing their ſpirits diſperſed and deuided, by reaſon of their priuat domeſticall diſſentions: yet did they take a good heart and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage vnto them, for the defence and maintenance of the poore and weake reliques of their declining and decaying Empire.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding <hi>Amurath</hi> could not any way deceiue or ouerreach <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Scanderbeg maketh prouiſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of reſiſtance againſt the Turkes.</note> who by long practiſe and experience, being well acquainted with the diſſimulations of that Monarchy, had all his cunning ſleightes and diſguiſementes at his fingers ends. Neuertheles, ſome ſay that he had alſo intelligence therof from ſome who were neare the Turke, and his ſpeciall fauorits, by the diſcouery of certaine ſecret meſſengers, who albeit they could not report it in any certainety, yet did the Albanois eaſily beleeue it. And one principall thing that made him the rather to credit it, was the extraordinary idleneſſe and vnaccuſtomed reſt of <hi>Ottoman,</hi> becauſe euen to that day, he had not ſent any new forces, either to reuenge the outrage done to <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> nor for the ſecurity &amp; defence of the limits and confines of his own country. Wherfore <hi>Caſtriot</hi> hauing laid aſide the care of the priuate and ciuill affaires of his eſtate, and being nothing at all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maied nor troubled in his mind for all that mighty and perillous tempeſt of war and vprore by the enemy, with a moſt ready and aduiſed reſolution, he prouided and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed in very good order whatſoeuer any other Chiefetaine (were he neuer ſo prudent and expert) could haue either foreſeen or executed in the like caſe or accident. For he diſpatched meſſengers out of hand with letters to al the Princes &amp; nations his confederates amongſt the Epirots; to the intent that both themſelues might be ready in armes, &amp; that they might arme others likewiſe, diſpoſing them in fit &amp; conuenient places for the aſſurance of their townes and ſtrong holdes: both by good and ſtrong garriſons and fortifications, and by the prouiſion of victuals and munitions in good ſtore and abundance more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ordinary. Becauſe the hugenes of ſo great a multitude, and ſo infinite numbers, did threaten all of them with like ruine and deſtruction, and with deſolation alike common vnto all of them: for that <hi>Ottoman</hi> ſeemed to imagine not his confuſion and ouerthrow alone, but the total ſubuerſion of the whole country of <hi>Epire.</hi> Himſelfe (not ſleeping nor being idle) after he had diſpatched <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; many others of his chiefeſt nobles, both to make a leauy and muſter of men, and to prouide corne ſufficient for the neceſſity of the time preſent, went from place to place, &amp; in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per perſon, to viſite and ouerſee all things, and ſending forth daily new and often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, taking not any reſt neither day nor night, till he had bereft the enemy of al fit matter &amp; occaſion, either of getting honor, or bringing dammage vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. And the better to compaſſe it, he cauſed the greater part of the husbandmen, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort of the people, who were vnfit for the field, (together with their families &amp; all that they had) to retire themſelues into the walled townes. But all thoſe which were men of any ſtrength or ability, &amp; were of age fit to beare armes, he retained to imploy them in diuerſe ſeruices of the wars. Neither did he forget the garriſon of <hi>Macedony:</hi> but they, and many other great troupes (aſſembled from all partes) and day by day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing to <hi>Croy,</hi> when they came to be incorporated &amp; ioyned in one, made a faire and goodly army. It remained now that he ſhould part his companies, and appoint them<note place="margin">Scanderbeg or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt the inuaſion of the Turkes.</note> to their ſeuerall charges. Firſt therfore he reſerued for his own regiment 10000. men, of thoſe whoſe ſeruice he had lately vſed in the warre of <hi>Venice,</hi> and at <hi>Chronichea,</hi> for with them he was aſſured, he might make head againſt the Barbarians, according as the oportunity of the place ſhould miniſter meanes vnto him. To the old garriſon of <hi>Croy</hi> (beſides the number of citizens) he added 1300. ſouldiers, all Epirots and men of approued valour, which made the Croians alſo to furniſh themſelues with all ſorts of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:13368:75"/>
armour and munitions, ſeruing for the defence of their walles and the repulſe of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, but eſpecially it encreaſed their courages, and the greatneſſe of their ſtomackes, which were faithfully deuoted to the preſeruation of their liberty. The ſame time therfore that the garriſon was brought into the towne, was the feeble ſexe of women<note place="margin">Scanderbeg re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueth old per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, women &amp; children out of the citie.</note> and children drawen forth without the wals, and none ſuffred to ſtay within, but the youth of the towne only, and ſuch as were fit for the wars. And yet were not they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted nor confounded with the baſeſt of the popular ſort, in whoſe harts and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, commonly the liuely ſparks of honor and of liberty, did not enter and penetrate ſoone or eaſily. Thus did <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> with good &amp; graue aduiſe and deliberation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for the importance of his affaires, becauſe that city was the chiefeſt place, and (as it were) the key of all his Realme, and the ſureſt fortreſſe to ſtay the courſes &amp; attempts of the Turks: and vpon which depended the whole ſtrength, the hope and the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the reſidue of the ſtate of <hi>Albany.</hi> But here might it be doubted, whether it<note place="margin">Queſtion. If better that women and children ſhould be excluded or retayned in a towne beſieged?</note> were better done, thus to take away the wiues and children from the ſight of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, or to haue ſuffered them to continue there ſtill, conſidering that their preſence and countenances full of griefe, the ſight of their teares, and the hearing of their lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, the miſery and feare of their ſeruitude, and the infamy of bonds and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment threatned vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are of far greater moment and of more force, beyond al com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon to animate &amp; to encorage men, then the bare remembrance of them away and abſent. But it may be notwithſtanding, that old and expert warriours, did hold it more expedient, and a matter of more certainty and aſſurance that they ſhould be abſent. For albeit in the eie of the regardants, this encoragement be in truth proper &amp; conuenient in the middeſt of their trauels and perils, to make them hazard their liues liberally and without feare: ſo is it of no ſmall force and efficacy to make the enemy more hard and obſtinate, by reaſon that the vnmeaſurable deſire of the prey (which they hope for) doth driue and cary on the ſouldier with a more ſetled reſolution, and doth enflame much more ardently the corages of the Barbarians to giue the charge &amp; to purſue it: making them to aduenture more fiercely, euen in deſpite of woundes, and to expoſe themſelues more furiouſly to the violence of the ſword: whereas (on the contrary) they goe on more coldly and temperatly, when they ſee nothing within the place, but the force and ſtrength of men ſtout and reſolute, when they ſhall ſee vpon the walles, none but ſuch as haue their hands thirſting greedily after bloud, and whoſe bodies are euen vowed and deſtinate to die without all care or regard of life.</p>
            <p>It was a pitifull ſpectacle to behold this mournfull multitude of the Croians, when they were to depart the towne, and to forſake their owne houſes &amp; habitations, euery where was to be heard nothing but complaints and lamentations of women. There was no houſe, ſtreet, nor corner of the towne exempted or free from griefe &amp; ſorrow: the market place did reſound with diuerſity of cries, ſome rebuking &amp; ſome blaming their friends for their grieuing at their departure, others inuiting and procuring them to teares and exclamations. But the moſt notable marke and ſhew of the publique miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune and dolefull affliction was to be ſeene at the temples and in the Churches, for there was a moſt maruellous concourſe of people of all ſorts and conditions. Infinite were the vowes and deuout praiers and ſupplications, intermingled with aboundance<note place="margin">A notable deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of the lamentation of the Croians vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture out of the city.</note> of tears &amp; lamentations, which were poured forth before the Altars. And that which made the ſight of this miſerable calamity to be the more hideous and terrible, was a cuſtome which this nation had in doing outrage to themſelues, by tearing their faces and beating their breaſts moſt pitifully. The like paſſion and vehemency of griefe did appeare in the graue women &amp; ancient matrones, who (beſides the deforming of their vilages) thought it a moſt pleaſant thing to imitate the ſorowfulnes of the others. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:13368:75"/>
was held ſhamefull, nothing was accompted too much or exceſsiue in this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident: but ſhee was reputed to haue deſerued moſt praiſe and commendation, whoſe diſcomfort was deemed to be moſt euident and apparant. There wanted not ſome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, who (according to the vſe and nature of mortall men, though not without ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar impiety and wickednes) did exclaime vpon the diuine power, attributing to God the cauſe of their griefe and misfortune. At the length when their ſorrow (ſomewhat eaſed with their teares) began in part to be mitigated and appeaſed: the mothers (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſsing their ſpeaches to their ſons) with oft repetitions would command them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, euer and among embracing them and kiſsing them. Sometimes they would put them in remembrance of the good offices and kind entreaty with which they had vſed them in their infancy, and of the mutuall loue and affection which they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in recompence of their kindneſſe: and ſometimes would they ſhew their aged lockes, and their Venerable white haires. All of them were in one caſe and vſed like ſpeaches: the wiues ſhewing their ſucking babes vnto their husbands, did deplore &amp; bewaile that from thenceforth they ſhould remaine in their dwellings in caſe of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes, and in pittifull eſtate of widdowhood. The aged fathers (as men confounded) and altogether ſilent for very griefe, and being in a wonderfull great care &amp; perplexity for the life of their ſons, durſt not by ſpeaking vnto them, neither animate nor pricke forward their valiant hearts, who were of themſelues ſufficiently fierce &amp; couragious. Neither durſt they diſſwade them from the trauels and dangers of armes, nor fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their deuoire &amp; perſeuerance in their ſeuerall charges &amp; duties, for doubt leaſt they ſhould be thought to prefer their affection to their children, before the loue and duty which they did owe vnto their country. But a general commandement being come from the Prince, that the town ſhould be diſcharged of this burdenſome company: &amp; that they which were in armes, ſhould repair euery man to his charge, (telling them that in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vp of vaine plaints, and by their priuate conſultations, they did but ſpend &amp; trifle away the time:) hereupon began the ſorrow to be renued, their cries and their teares began a freſh, neither more nor leſſe, then as if they had already ſeene the enemy to ranſacke and ſpoile al things, to draw and drag away their husbands, their fathers, and their mothers into cruell bondage: to raze and breake downe their wals, and to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, pollute, and prophane their Churches, and all holy and ſacred myſteries. Hardly could the multitude be drawen from that which they had once embraced, and euery one would haue remained as the companion of his friends danger, and the partner of his fortune: notwithſtanding, ſeeing that the criers and other officers of the Prince, did now preſſe and importune them to depart, (then taking their leaue with their laſt kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and embracements) all of them at length, each after other, with ſighes and groanes, left the ſight of that which they held moſt deare: and ſtill caſting backe their eies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the city wals, they ſet forward on their way without any care or regard, where they ſet their foote, or which way they went. It is ſayd that they were tranſported into the townes of <hi>Epire,</hi> that lay vpon the ſea ſide, and in other places and cities vnder the obeyſance of the Venetians, and other their confederats: where likewiſe an innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble multitude of husbandmen and laborers were retired, with their cattell, beaſts, and moueables, to the intent the enemy ſhould finde nothing to prey vppon, whereby he might be relieued or holpen.</p>
            <p>After that the multitude was ſent away, and that this trouble and tumult within<note place="margin">Scanderbeg prouideth vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, armour and munition for the war<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The ſame time that <hi>Caſtriot</hi> with his forces here and there aſſembled from all parts<note place="margin">Amurath lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uieth a mighty army againſt Scanderbeg.</note> of <hi>Epire,</hi> was making towards <hi>Croy,</hi> to take order for the ſafety and aſſurance of that ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: the Turkiſh army which had bene leauied in <hi>Aſia,</hi> was tranſported into <hi>Europe,</hi> and by long iorneis was arriued at <hi>Andrinople,</hi> their numbers not exceeding 40000. For whenſoeuer the <hi>Sultan</hi> had any war in <hi>Europe,</hi> the moſt part of his forces were vſually leauied in thoſe quarters neare the ſame place: both for that the ſouldiers of thoſe parts are better acquainted &amp; accuſtomed with the maners of the Chriſtians in their wars, and alſo for that their preparations may be there made more commodiouſly, &amp; with greater celerity, as being at home and in his owne countrey.</p>

Some held opinion that without any tempori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing <q>or further daliance, it were neceſſary to ſend before into <hi>Epire</hi> a running campe of horſemen (whom they call <hi>Alcanzi</hi> or <hi>Achimzi,</hi>) and whom we may wel reſemble to<note place="margin">Alcanzi, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturers without pay.</note> our aduenturers, (a moſt cruell and brutiſhe kinde of people, and giuen extreamelie to robbing and ſtealing.) And that theſe, as an outragious tempeſt comming vpon them ſodainely, and ſurprizing them at vnawares, with notable violence ſhould deſtroy, confound, and turne all vp ſide downe: and that the enemy (not carrying themſelues very wary and circumſpect) but vnder colour of fained fight, being deluded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by theſe troupes, ſhould be drawen forth to the fight, in ſuch ſort, that his maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty following neare at hand (in proper perſon) with the groſſe of his whole army, might the more eaſily and entirely oppreſſe and vanquiſhe them. Others were ofa contrary aduiſe, perſwading him in any caſe to forbeare by ſuch meanes to prouoke, and incite the enemy: for feare either of giuing occaſion to the Chriſtians to prouide
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:13368:77"/>
themſelues of things neceſſary for ſo long and tedious a warre, or leaſt they themſelues might runne headlong firſt of all into their traines and counterwayes: that the late ſlaughters ſuſtained by others had ſufficiently taught them. Beſides that they had intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence (which was now euery where and commonly reported) that the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince of <hi>Albanie,</hi> being throughly prouided and prepared, was already in armes, their townes ſtrongly fortified, and their fortreſſes garniſhed with ſouldiours for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and with other preparatiues in good quantitie: and that all places both paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages and ſtreightes were purpoſely poſſeſſed and full of ſouldiours: that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> with the reſidue of his troupes did dayly ride vppe and downe viſiting the prouince, and ſearching and viewing the thickettes and ſecret corners of the woodds and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtes, to the intent he might once againe conueniently and according to his minde lodge in them his happy and fortunate ambuſhments: that it was a moſt pernitious thing to imagine to preuaile againſt ſo cautelous and warie an enemy by warring in that manner: that they ought rather to take an other courſe of better aſſuraunce, and which the iſſue and euent might not yet once againe reproue and condemne, as it had done in times paſt. For what ſhould let (ſayd they) but that all of them might miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carie vnder the ſword of the <hi>Albanois</hi> before that the ſame ſuccours ofa campe ſo heauily charged ſhould be able to retaine them. Wherefore to preuent the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that they ſhould not by the bloud and ſlaughter of their people, preſate vnto them ſelues any good fortune in this warre, they held it better to march on with their whole armie all at once, to the intent they might at length deliuer the Empire of <hi>Ottoman,</hi> from the labour and burthen of this troubleſome warre. Neither of theſe opinions was allowed,</q> but a third (indifferent betweene both) caried a way the matter, as being more fitte and commodious for the qualitie of that time, and for the honour and reputation of ſuch an enterpriſe. It was concluded therefore that the third part or little leſſe of the whole army, ſhould aduaunce foreward before the reſidue, ſuppoſing that that number would ſuffice, not onely to repell, and keepe the enemy from going forward (but if neede were) to ſet vppon them: and that by their ſodaine comming, they ſhould be able both to diſturbe the courſe of the enemies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires and purpoſe, and conſequently to prepare a free paſſage for the army royall of his Maieſty.</p>
            <p>According to this concluſion, there were immediatly choſen &amp; ſent away 40000.<note place="margin">Amurath ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth part of his army before to beſiege Sfety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade.</note> light horſemen, whoſe ordinary armes were ſword &amp; target, &amp; lance, a plate of maile and a mace of iron.

And euery Flambur hath vnder him alſo many Subaſſides or chiefes of companies, who are of a higher regard and accompt, and haue a larger ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend then the Timariots: and according to their qualities are allowed either a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or leſſe number of horſemen vnder their charge. The foote bands likewiſe both of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> haue their order certaine, and are diſtributed into ſeuerall compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies vnder their Captaines. In like manner the auxiliary forces, or extraordinarie ſuccours (which in time of warre are commonlie decreed, and ſent to the Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior) were not of any meane or ſmall number.

They certified him (as feare maketh men credulous) and yet were they vncertaine of it, that <hi>Amurath</hi> him ſelfe was there in perſon, and had already filled and couered with armes, men, and horſes, both the mountaines and vallyes, and the champion and plaine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys: and they inſtantly prayed their Prince, to prouide for the ſuretie of his troupes, and of his perſon eſpecially: and not of a pernitious and ouer much hardineſſe to attend in plaine field at the firſt comming, the furious violence of ſo puiſſant an enemy: that he would retire his ſouldiers into ſome place of a notable height &amp; inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsible, from whence he might behold the vſage of the enemy, and ſo to deuiſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue vpon ſome ſure courſe, which ſhould be moſt for his profit and commoditie.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſpeeches did not much moue <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> neither could theſe perſwaſions<note place="margin">Scanderbeg with 5000. me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt the enemie.</note> make him diſlodge from that place, whereof he had once made choiſe to encampe in: neuertheleſſe when he perceiued and vnderſtood that his ſcoutes did on all ſides returne vnto him with more then poſting ſpeede: and their reportes did agree all in one, ſaue that they differed in the number and quantitie of the enemies forces, of which they coniectured diuerſly, (for the Turkes were not yet ſeene nor diſcouered altogether: neither were they deſcended all of them into the plains: neither were their Batallions ſo vnited and ordred, that a true and certaine eſtimat could be made of their iuſt numbers:) <hi>Caſtriot</hi> thereupon chooſing out of his whole army, 4000. horſe, and 1000. foote, whom he commaunded to follow him and diſlodging as ſecretly as he could, from thence drew directly towardes <hi>Sfetigrade,</hi> where he knew that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were to encampe themſelues. It was in the dawning of the morning in the twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, that the ſouldiers had the ſigne giuen them to ſet forward. The day following notwithſtanding, when it was ſcarce the third houre of the night, they came to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campe within ſeauen miles of <hi>Sfetigrade,</hi> betweene which towne and <hi>Croy,</hi> were litle leſſe then 60. miles. There <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> hauing choſen a place ſure and commodious for his company, cauſed it to be entrenched round about, making it by that meanes more ſtrong and defenſible.

Vpon the dawning of the day, and by that time that the ſtarres began to grow out<note place="margin">Moſes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſent to draw the Turkes ſorth to fight.</note> of ſight by the breake of the morning, they were now come within little more then a myle of the tentes of the enemy: at ſuch time as the Turkes ſentinels hauing diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them from aloft, began firſt by ſignes ſhewed in the aire, &amp; then by their often cries &amp; clamors to bewray them. They nothing troubled not abaſhed with their noiſe, did only haſten their pace ſomwhat faſter: (for as yet, neither needed they to feare any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from the enemy, neither would their flight haue bene to any purpoſe.) At the le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth one of the Turkiſh ſquadro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s being wakened by the ſentinels, &amp; yet (by reaſon of their ſleepe being in ſome doubt) taking their weapons in their hand, they aduanced them ſelues forward &amp; began to ruſh vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſuppoſing them to be ſhepheards, or peaſants loden with corn.

The Barbarians coniecturing their feare by their flight, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued after them with great ſpeede and charged them behinde in moſt rude &amp; furious manner. Then they all at once ſtopping their horſes, turned about, and making head againſt them (with their ſwordes drawen,) they went on and drew neare to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them (as being enforced by neceſsitie either to incurt the laſt extremitie of danger;) or elſe by oppoſing their bodies and turning their faces to make reſiſtance and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe the violence with which they were ſo egerly purſued: for that whileſt they held on this their diſſembled flight, they were in manifeſt daunger, their enemies horſes euen breathing cloſe at their backes: yet were not the Turkes any whit abaſhed for all this, but couering them ſelues with their large targettes, and meaſuring the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my by their habite onely, they approched them, and were the firſt that gaue the onſet<note place="margin">A shirmiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene certain Turkes and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirots.</note> againſt them. One of them borne in <hi>Aſia,</hi> being of a mighty ſtature and wonderfull ſtrong made, marched before his fellowes with a heauy mace of iron, the which after he had oftentimes whirled about with his right hand to giue it the more force, with a mighty cry and clamor, and with an incredible violence, he threw it ouerthwart the whole troupe of the Albanois: the which (being cloſe knit and ioyned together) albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it they ſuſtained no harme thereby, yet could they not auoyd the force of the blow co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The number of the combattants being almoſt equal &amp; their armes not much vnlike, it was a very goodly and pleaſant ſight, and it gaue good grace vnto the combat. For the Turkes were no better armed then the Chriſtians, by reaſon they made ſuch haſt out of their trenches, and did in a maner contemne their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enemies. The weapons wherewith they were armed, was but a cimitary and a ſhield. In one point only the Infidels had the diſaduantage, and that was, that the very choiſe and beſt men at armes, and the floure of the youth of <hi>Albany</hi> was there in place, where as their company on the contrary were intermingled with people of no reckoning &amp; men of valure both together: for that according as the skoutes had raiſed them confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly and in tumult, ſo did they iſſue forth both one &amp; other to the fight. This was the occaſion that euen in the very firſt fury of the encounter, their fortune did appeare to be far inferior. For the Aſian (in whom conſiſted the ſtrength of the reſt) being ſlaine by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the others were ſuprized with an incredible feare, diſpairing not only of the victory, but alſo of their life &amp; ſafety, if they had not ſpeedily ſome ſuccors from the campe. Wherefore by litle &amp; litle retiring themſelues, in the end they began<note place="margin">The Turks put to flight.</note> to ſhew their backs: and (with change of fortune) by a moſt ſhamefull flight, forſooke

Their audacitie and courage was greatly augmented through fortunat ſucceſſe of this encounter, yet did they defer all their ioy, till ſuch time as they had accompliſhed a happy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion of the enterpriſe which they had vndertaken. It chanced that one of their company well knowen amongſt his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, through his manifold good deſertes in the wars, found himſelfe to be gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly wounded: in ſomuch that his continuall complaints, and the impatiencie of his paine proceeding of his wound, did greatly trouble the contentment of all the reſt, and did not a little diſcomfort his companions: for one of the Turkes with his ſword had thruſt him through the left ſhoulder ſo as he had not ſufficient ſtrength, either to carie his armes, or to guide his owne horſe. <hi>Moſes</hi> tooke great compaſsion of his griefe, and diſmounting from horſebacke, he tooke him downe with his owne handes, and ſet him vppe behinde one of the ſouldiours, to whoſe charge hee committed him, willing him to haue a care that he did not fall from behinde him, becauſe if he galloped his horſe, his handes were not able to ſuſtaine him: and that he ſhould make haſt with all ſpeede poſsible to carie him to the Campe, to the intent before any other allarme or tumult were rayſed by the enemie, he might be gotten within the tentes amongeſt his companions: as for the reſt of his fellowes, they were all ſound, and not one of them beſides him, returned hurt from the medly: Of the Circumſized there were fiue ſlaine and eight wounded, few to count of, but yet many in regard of their ſmall number.</p>
            <p>By that time that the horſe (whereon the two ſouldiours were mounted) had ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried<note place="margin">The Turkes campe in a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult vpon the diſcomfiting of their fellowes.</note> them quite out of ſight, there was heard a maruellous cry and noyſe in the Campe of <hi>Amurath:</hi> for thoſe which had bene wounded, at their returne filled all with their plaints and exclamations, and ſhewing their deformed and vnmeaſurable woundes, they ſet all the hoaſt of the enemy in a tumult and a rage: eſpecially ſuch as were of any affinitie to thoſe that were ſlaine. Wherefore (not reſpecting any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand made to the contrarie) they disbanded them ſelues on all ſides from their enſignes without any chiefe, without order and all diſcretion, according as their anger and deſire of reuenge enflamed them: but proclamation being made ouer the whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, by the commandement of their commander, that no man ſhould ſtirre or bouge, euery man retired: then they arranged them ſelues in order of battell before his tents, there attending his pleaſure. Their Generall did greatly doubt the accuſtomed ſleights and traines of the Chriſtians: ſuſpecting that vnder pretence of forraging, ſome nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deceipt and guilefull pollicie might be lurking: and the rather, for that the ſtrange largeneſſe of the woundes of his ſouldiours, did plainely argue that it was not the arme of any baſe or raſcall perſons, nor the ſwordes of countrey clownes that could giue ſuch ſtrokes and cruell blowes. He determined therfore to take out of his whole armie foure thouſand horſe, ſuch as were moſt fierce and venturous: to the intent the fewneſſe &amp; ſmall nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of his people might not ſtil cauſe them to returne with ſhame and diſgrace: them he enioyned both to ſcatter thoſe forragers, and to put them from their horſes: and then with diligent ſearch to raunge throughout all the mountaines, hils, valleyes, woods and ſecret places to diſcouer the ambuſhments of the <hi>Albanois.</hi>

with his hurt companion was arriued in preſence of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> and hauing deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his charge to ſome of his fellowes, who came to meete him, and willing them to haue a care to the curing of his wounds; himſelfe ranne vp and downe in the ſight of the ſouldiers, as one almoſt out of his wits: and calling manie by their names he cried with a loud voice, Arme arme, the enemy is comming, all their camp is in arms,<q>
                  <note place="margin">Alarme in the campe of Scanderbeg.</note> they haue taken their allarme: and (pointing with his finger) he ſhewed them the duſt, as an argument of their comming. At the firſt, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> was ſomewhat moued &amp; abaſhed, fearing leaſt his people had miſcaried, for of all the troupe he ſaw but two onely returned,</q> and both of them (as it were) ſhamefully flying: the one of them alſo halfe dead, embrued and polluted with the warme blood that yet iſſued from his wounds: and the other by the fooliſh crie and exclamation which he made, did ſhew himſelfe full of feare and ill aſſured. But after he vnderſtood by him how all things had paſſed; his ſorrow being turned into laughter, and his care into boldneſſe &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, he willed his men to be al of good courage, and that euery one ſhould be in a readines with his horſe &amp; armor. By this time had our Sentinels (which were placed<note place="margin">Turkes purſus Moſes and hit companie.</note> vpon the height of the mountaines) diſcouered <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Turkes comming after him, ouer the plaine champion, euen readie to fall into their ambuſcado, and to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered to the ſword of the Epirots. For at the firſt our men made no great haſte, but rode on, driuing their beaſts faire and eaſily, bending their courſe ſometimes here, ſometimes there, and rather attending for them, then flying from them: but as ſoone as they perceiued a farre off, that the Infidelles were iſſued foorth of their trenches: then leauing both their ſackes &amp; their carriage, they prepared themſelues to a round and ſpeedie flight. Wherefore hauing poaſted ouer the plaine in a moment, they got to a hill which (on the North ſide being oppoſite vnto a certaine valley) did couer the center and bottome thereof, where our men lay cloſe, and couertly encamped: and before they were ouertaken with the danger, or that the enemy could preſſe too neere vpon them, they did ſecretly conuey themſelues among their fellowes, both they and their horſes ſo ſpent and out of breath with their continuall courſing and trauell, that it made ſhew they had fled in good earneſt. The enemie perceiuing that they were in a moment gotten out of ſight, &amp; thinking (becauſe they were ſo ſuddenly ſlipt away from the top of the mountaine) that they were hidden in the bottome of the valley. They followed directly after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without any feare or conſideration. But as they came neere vnto the place, to the intent they might more eaſily enuiron and encloſe them, both on the one ſide &amp; on the other, all ſcattered &amp; out of order, they prepared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, ſome to gaine the top of the hill, and others by ſome meanes or other to enter into the valley. But at their arriuall notwithſtanding, hearing a great neighing of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny horſes, they began to be aſtoniſhed, &amp; to ſtand ſtill, without ſpeaking a word, but vſing ſilence for a ſeaſon, till ſuch time as the noiſe of the horſes being more certainly diſcouered, and growing more ſenſible to be heard, did manifeſtly diſcouer the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcado of the enemie. Then did all things ſeeme greater vnto them by ſight of the eye, then they had imagined by the eare: and the vncertaintie of the danger being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted (as is vſuall) according to the greatnes of their feare, did eaſily perſwade this people (thus amazed &amp; terrified) to betake themſelues to preſent and ſpeedy flight. As<note place="margin">Turkes fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ambus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cado of the Epirots.</note> they were ready to breake &amp; make away, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> (co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding the trumpets ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to ſound, &amp; putting them in a wonderfull feare as not expecting any ſuch thing) made head againſt them, &amp; went to charge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on the right hand, <hi>Tanuſee</hi> on the left hand; &amp; the footmen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a loft out of thoſe ragged &amp; woddy places of the mountains, where they lay in ambuſh deſcending ſuddenly vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, all at one inſtant, with great fury did beat them downe &amp; ouerthrow them: neuertheleſſe they did abide, ſurpriſed

rather with a kind of admiration &amp; aſtoniſhment, then of any certaine reſolution to endure the fight. But when they ſaw that neceſſitie did enforce them, &amp; that the furie<note place="margin">Conflict be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the Turkes and the Epirots.</note> of the Chriſtians did vrge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to do their beſt: then ſetting ſpurs to their horſes, with ſingular fierceneſſe they got poſſeſſion of the mountaine: where firſt lifting vp their lances, &amp; caſting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt the enemy (as if they had bin darts) for that the vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the place, the vneuennes of the ground, &amp; being withall very ſteepe, did not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them otherwiſe to helpe themſelues with thoſe weapons: they kept the ſouldiers for a time from co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming neere them. But <hi>Peic Manuel</hi> being gotten vpon the hill on<note place="margin">Peic Manuel.</note> the other ſide, with a company of footmen (of which 200. were archers, &amp; as many crosbowes) did ſoone beate them off the place &amp; droue them downe with more then good ſpeed. Beneath were they beſet on all ſides with our forces, &amp; aboue them did the intollerable violence of the ſhot ſo gaull them, that there was ſcarce any free place for the miſerable wretches to get forth. In this extremity, drawing forth their Cimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries &amp; deuiding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues into two troupes, deſperately they ruſhed vpon their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, &amp; (as men that had cloſed their eyes againſt all perils) with a greater ſlaughter of their companies they oppoſed themſelues to the blowes &amp; ſwords of the enemy. But it was no difficult matter for the greater to beat back the leſſer nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber: &amp; for men freſh &amp; ſound, to put them to the retreat who were wery &amp; ſore trauelled: eſpecially in the right ſide, where <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> himſelf with a groſſe troup, both of horſe &amp; foot armed with pikes did ſtand in manner of a wall or ſtrong bulwarke. This was an occaſion that the Turks did altogether reſolue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to try the vttermoſt of their valure: &amp; therfore ioining themſelues cloſe together in one ſtrong ſquadron, they gaue in vpon the left ſide, and with an equal &amp; deſperate kind of fury, they made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues way with their ſwords, euen through the midſt of our battallion: and thus purchaſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues a paſſage with great loſſe &amp; bloudſhed, the remnant fighting &amp; flying al at once, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for their owne ſafety. Then began a ſudden confuſion, and the Albanois forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king both their ranks &amp; the keeping of the mountain, (euery man forgetting all other matters) tooke care only to purſue the vanquiſhed, &amp; made haſt to the executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by all means poſſible to make the others alſo in their fight copartners of the like mortall calamity &amp; bloudy ſlaughter. In that tumult (when they ſought to iſſue tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the enemy) more were beaten downe &amp; ouerthrowen, by their owne weight &amp; the armes of their fellowes, then by the power of the aduerſary. Notwithſtanding there eſcaped of them litle leſſe then 2000. the reſidue remained behind for a gage, and their carkaſſes (whileſt they were yet panting) being diſpoiled, were left naked vpon<note place="margin">The victorie of the Epirots a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt 4000.

Of thoſe that fled about 80. were taken priſoners, the reſidue were not purſued aboue 20. paces or little more, becauſe of the ſudden retreat ſounded by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented himſelf with this victory: alleaging that if he ſhould ſuffer his ſouldiers to fulfill their own deſires to the extremity vpon their enemies, there was great danger leſt he ſhold pay dearely for this proſperity. There were won fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the barbarians 3. Enſigns or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets (for more had they not brought with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>). The horſes of thoſe which were ſlain being full 1000. or better, did greatly augment &amp; enrich the booty: the reſidue were killed in the fight.

            <p>Thus did the Prince of <hi>Albany</hi> by a notable prey &amp; victory reward &amp; recompence the loſſe of his corne, vpon the bringing whereof into the campe of the Turks, lying before the towne, euery one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made great ioy &amp; triumph, expecting hourely that theſe victuallers ſhould haue bin led thither tyed &amp; bound to their appointed puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; to haue bin offered as a ſacrifice to the vnhappy ghoſts of thoſe 5. who were firſt ſlaine. But when they ſaw afterwards contrarie to their imagination, the maſſacre

and hiddeous ſhew &amp; deformity of ſo great &amp; goodly a companie: of pure deſpite and vaine indignation conceiued, they made great lamentation, and through extreme ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row<note place="margin">The grieſe and trouble of the Turkiſh campe vpon the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of their forces.</note> they ſtood for a time (as men inchaunted and amazed) not without maruellous feare &amp; trembling of all the armie, and doubting leaſt the Chriſtians animated with this proſperous aduenture, ſhould come on with the like ſucceſſe, to force them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their campe. For they ſuſpected that the numbers of our men were much greater, &amp; that all the Prouince had bene in armes before them. Their chiefeſt care therefore was to ſet a good and ſtrong watch ouer all the army, and carefully to arrange euerie companie in order of battell, neere the tents of their ſeuerall commaunders, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiron them round about: and accordingly the bands were parted into their places. Their horſes were kept ſtanding with their bridles on, as if they had bin aſſured that the enemy would haue viſited the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> immediatly. But the <hi>Albanois</hi> was otherwiſe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, neither did this victory cauſe him to be the more high minded, nor yet made him any thing the more loftie: but he redoubted as much the enemy, as they ſtood in feare &amp; doubt of him: &amp; he did looke euery houre that they ſhould attempt ſomwhat vpon him, to aboliſh the diſhonor of their laſt ouerthrow: and eſpecially for that the report ran firme &amp; conſtant how the army roiall was at hand. This made <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> to looke to his buſines more carefully, &amp; therfore the firſt thing he did, was (aſſoone as it grew dark night) quietly to truſſe vp baggage &amp; to depart, encamping 5. miles far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the enemy. The next day before ſunne riſing, he ſent <hi>Tanuſee</hi> towards <hi>Croy,</hi> with 50. horſemen &amp; ech of them a varlet, both to haſten away thoſe forces, which he had left there with <hi>George Streeſe,</hi> and to haue the guiding of that conuoy which was ſent for the conueiance of the horſes and other pillage lately gotten from the enemie, into other places within the Prouince, where he willed they ſhould be tranſported for their more ſafetie and ſecuritie. In 7. daies ſpace was all this ordered &amp; diſpatched, and the whole troupes vnited and incorporated. And yet about two daies before the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall of theſe ſupplies to the campe, there came in ſight 5000. Turkes vaunt currours of the armie royall: and a three houres within night they pitched their tentes before <hi>Sfetygrade.</hi> The day following, about the ſhutting of the euening, thither alſo came <hi>Amurath</hi> himſelfe in perſon, with the reſt of his armie and all his carriage.</p>
            <p>It was in the yeare of our redemption 1449. and the 9. yeare after that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi>

This was it alſo that moued the <hi>Ottoman</hi> expreſly to forbid his ſouldiers to waſte or ſpoile any thing within the enemies country, nor to tread down their corne, to the intent whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſhold grow ripe &amp; be readie to reape, it might ſerue for the prouiſion of his army. The <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> at his arriuall before <hi>Sfetygrade</hi> did make a glorious ſhew &amp; oſtentation of all his forces before the towne: and this he ſeemed to do not without any reaſon, but vpon good conſideration &amp; aduiſe, both becauſe it is the cuſtome of that Nation, &amp; to the intent he might by the ſight therof terrifie the inhabitants.

The Turkes Embaſſadour pretending that it was his part to ſpeake, becauſe he had procured the parley: at the very firſt, enforced himſelfe by a number of flattering and entiſing ſpeeches to purchaſe credite with the citizens, and to gaine their fauour and good liking. He beganne with the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of many cities and Nations, diſcourſing in all points ſo well and eloquently, that you could not haue reprehended him in anie thing, ſaue onely (the more to terrifie them) he extolled beyond all meaſure &amp; humaine capacitie, the power and puiſſance <q>of the king his maiſter. <hi>Perlat</hi> made him aunſwere ſaying, That he had eloquently<note place="margin">The worthie anſwere of Perlat to the, Turkiſh Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour.</note> and excellently well pleaded this matter, had it not beene to ſuch men whoſe cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages were reſolutely determined, and whoſe hearts were vowed to the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of their libertie. That all of them could be well and willingly content to yeeld to his demaunds, if either the bootleſſe threates and menaces of <hi>Ottoman</hi> and their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, could preuaile with their couragious hearts: or that the commaund or Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niorie of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> were grieuous and yrkeſome vnto them. But neither could they charge him for his part with any miſdeed or ill deſert, neither did they know where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Amurath</hi> had benefited them, whereby they ſhould be drawen to preferre a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger before a citizen, an enemie before a friend, or an Infidell before a Chriſtian. That the <hi>Sultan</hi> ſhould doe, aſſay, and enterpriſe what he could by armes: that he ſhould by the ſword ſeeke to terrifie the defendants: that he ſhould not ſpare to batter their wals. In briefe, that he ſhould firſt of all make a maſſacre of their bodies, and lay their dead carkaſſes in huge heapes, to ſee if the inhabitants terrified and feared with this ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, would then come vnto him vppon their knees, and proſtrate themſelues at his feete, to graunt them theſe conditions of peace and compoſition. That for the preſent he held it a thing infamous and meerely rediculous, to abaſe and ſubmit their heartes to ſo great an indignitie: before ſuch time as they had ſeene the enſignes of the enemie to make proofe of their valure againſt their wals and bulwarkes: before the ſouldiers had preſented them with any skirmiſh: before they ſaw any ſignes of lamentations, of wounds, or of bloudſhed among their owne people: and before ſuch time as they did perceiue, either the frame of their walles diſioynted, or their towne diſpoyled, and made naked of her flankers and defences. That <hi>Amurath</hi> ſhould doe much better to quite himſelfe of the daily cares and vnquietnes of the warres, to take his way back againe to <hi>Andrinople,</hi> to raiſe his ſiege from before the towne, and to ſpend the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue and end of his life and aged yeares, quietly at home, and not any longer to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke and incenſe by his armes, a people who is fatall vnto him: and whoſe faith and excellent fidelitie in the conſeruation of their libertie, and whoſe ſingular affection and deuotion to their lordes both in publique and in priuate, he had often tried and approued with ſo much bloudſhed, and the ruine of his owne ſouldiers and ſubiects. That he for his part, as long as his life laſted, would neuer forſake or abandon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoire and dutie of his faith once ſworne vnto his Prince: nor the towne which he had committed to his cuſtodie and protection. That he helde it ſufficient and ample recompence, and reputed it honor ynough for him, if he did either ſuruiue to ſee his countrie ſafe and preſerued, or (if it ſhould happen to come to ruine and deſtruction)
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:13368:82"/>
then ſhould the ſtrength of his right arme neuer ceaſe to ſeeke the reuenge of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique libertie, till ſuch time (as keeping co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie among the dead bodies of his friends) his innocent ſoule did paſſe and depart away to the libertie of a better countrie.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This his anſwer and the aſſembly did finiſh both at once: for the great men and magiſtrates of the towne there preſent, all with one voice and with infinite commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,<note place="margin">The Turke his meſſengers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne in raine from the town.</note> (extolling the ſpeech of the Gouernor) did generally approue it, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on it accordingly.

            <p>The aſſurance and grauitie of the Sfetigradians, together with the prudence of their Commander being vnderſtood by the <hi>Ottoman</hi> did not a litle moue him. The like did the abundance of all good prouiſions marked within the towne by the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors: for it abounded in ſuch plentie, that they had not onely to ſuffice for their neceſſitie, but euen with exceſſe and ſuperfluity.

Wherefore accordingly as it was reſolued in their ſecret aſſemblies and conſultations, albeit they had before prouided for moſt things requiſite, both for the ſtuffing of their holds with ſtrong garriſons, &amp; for the gard of the ſtreights &amp; paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for their countrey: they ſent notwithſtanding from all partes Ambaſſadours to <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> entreating him not to ſuffer <hi>Amurath</hi> any longer to vexe and tyrannize ouer the townes of <hi>Albania</hi> at his pleaſure, and with ſuch impunitie.

But he receiued from the Gouernor a notable anſwer: the recitall whereof (as well beſeeming and worthy of his ſound faith and loialty) I ſee no reaſon why we ſhould omit: or by an vngratefull kinde of ſilence, to defraud ſo great and honorable a perſon of his deſerued praiſe and commendation.

               <hi>Caſtriot</hi> knew not what to ſay here againſt, but only to purge and excuſe himſelfe: telling him that he came not thither to vſe anie exhortations vnto them, but onely to aduertiſe them how all things ſtood. And thereupon after he had embraced the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour, he tooke his leaue both of him and of his ſouldiers, and ſo paſſed onwardes to other places: where finding all things according to his deſire, he left them as hee found them: and retyring towards his armie, he came to his campe ſomewhat before day, being extremely wearie through the long trauell of his iourney.

As touching the ſuccours which they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred<note place="margin">Anſwere of Scanderbeg to the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> him, his anſwere was: That they ſhould be of good courage, that his intent was not for that time to vſe any greater forces againſt the enemie, nor (all things being as yet in good caſe) to diſarme the flankes of his confederates: but he would wiſh them <q>in the meane while to be ready prepared, and to haue a good eye to the <hi>Ottoman:</hi> for that it was very difficult to diſcouer the enterprizes and counſels of one ſo trecherous and diſloial: that aſſoone as good occaſion were offered him to enterprize any thing, he would not faile ſpeedily and beyond their expectation, with ſuch forces as he had to inuade him: &amp; when the neceſſitie of his affaires ſhould exact it, or that the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of a greater danger, or the occaſion of a ſet battell did require it: that then he would vſe their aide and readie ſuccours as farre forward as his owne forces.</q> Theſe things thus diſpatched, the tables were couered after the ſouldiers faſhion: and after that they had refreſhed themſelues, and had bene honorably rewarded with great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents: about the ninth houre of the morning they were licenſed to depart.</p>
            <p>Whileſt that matters did thus paſſe on by conſultations: and that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> rather with wordes then deedes did ſeeme to inuade the Turkiſh Prince; the other beganne the battery againſt <hi>Sfetigrade,</hi> which though it had bene long deferred, yet<note place="margin">Sfetigrade battered by the Turkes.</note> was it fully concluded &amp; agreed on. He placed therefore two pieces of artillerie of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding greatnes (for he had brought no more with him) vpon a certaine high place directly againſt the towne, where the walles were moſt open and diſcouered. Three whole daies together did the thundering of the cannon continue; by which time ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made a large and wide breach, the <hi>Sultan</hi> imagined preſently, that his enſignes the next morning would haue cleared the breach: and (by reaſon that it was of a great largeneſſe) both the flanckers, and the wall being on all ſides beaten downe and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen, he was fully perſwaded, and did in a manner promiſe to himſelfe: that his ſouldiers might eaſily enter the towne: and that (notwithſtanding any reſiſtance or deuiſe which the defendants ſhould vſe againſt them) they ſhould not be able to hold them out, but that they would get the poſſeſſion of the place. Of all this, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> had notice the ſame night by his eſpials, and by ſuch as were appointed to keepe the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:13368:84"/>
watch in ſeuerall places thereabouts: and therefore giuing a neere coniecture of the ſecret intent and purpoſe of <hi>Amurath:</hi> he was at the firſt in ſome doubt and miſtruſt, leaſt they within the towne being preſſed with the exceeding multitudes of the aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants ſhould not be able and of ſufficient power to repulſe them: beſides that the ruine of the wall on that ſide, did augment this his feare and ſuſpition. Wherefore after he had debated many matters in his mind, he concluded at length, that he would diuert and take vpon himſelfe ſome part of the perill and of their labours: &amp; that he would ſomewhat eaſe the beſieged of their trauels. About midnight therefore (taking with<note place="margin">Scanderbeg approcheth nearer to the Turkiſh camp.</note> him victuals for one day onely and no more, and leauing all the reſt of the baggage in his campe) he went to entrench himſelfe within fiue myles of the enemie, in the ſame place where he had laſt layed his ambuſcado. But he ſent before him, two of the chiefeſt of his nobilitie <hi>Muſache,</hi> and <hi>Gnirize de Vladrenne</hi> (men of a notable and ſingular conceipt and ſubtiltie) to take a view of the camp of the enemie, and to marke what courſe they would take in the aſſault: he himſelfe in the meane time abode there ſtill without any noiſe, till ſuch time as they returned, that he might then reſolue v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his proceedings accordingly.</p>
            <p>About the ſeauenth houre in the morning was the returne of theſe gentlemen to their Generall: and at the ſame time, the Aſappi and Ianiſſaries (men that contemned and regarded no perils) were brought foorth of their trenches: and being armed of purpoſe with a notable reſolution, they marched vp the mountaine. The horſemen for all that they could doe, were not able to get aboue ſome three ſteppes aboue the bottome and foote of the hill, by reaſon of the ſteepeneſſe and roughneſſe of the place:<note place="margin">Sfetygrade aſſaulted.</note> and therfore ſtanding there aloofe, and ſhooting with their arrowes towards them, they did rather feare then repell the defendants at the breach, whileſt the raskall mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and vile and baſer ſort of the Turkes, were drawen on to preſent themſelues to the firſt furie of the Chriſtians: to the intent that they being tyred and wearied with the killing of theſe ſlaues and raskals: and the citizens being otherwiſe occupied and drawn away with eſcaladoes, from the defence of the places aſſigned to their cuſtody,<note place="margin">A ſtratageme vſuall amongſt the Turkes.</note> the others might afterwards find the leſſe reſiſtance, and with the geater eaſe make themſelues maiſters of the rampiers, which by this meanes might be diſfurniſhed of all defence. This was it that was attempted on that ſide where the violence of the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non had made the breach. But the ſudden mounting of the place being of it ſelfe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally vpright and ſteepe riſing, did eaſily beat backe the aſſailants; who at ech ſtroke that was giuen them (were it neuer ſo litle) were turned vpſide downe by the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants: who alſo had ſpent all the night in repairing and fortifying of the breach, by caſting vp a rampier or countermure in faſhion of a platforme: which they trimmed with plancks, boords, and baskets made of oſiers, and well ſupported and borne vp with ſtrong poſtes faſtened round about, and with great heapes of ſtones: ſo that the verie height and downefall of the place, did make their dartes and other ſhot (being but weakely throwen and deliuered) either to flie ſtaggering and without any force: or to be beaten downe backewardes vpon thoſe which preſſed forward: who could ſcarcely find any ſtay or reſt, or any plaine or ſmooth place to get themſelues footing, as they preſſed to the aſſault, nor yet to ſtop and ſtay their bodies as they tumbled and rolled downe when they had the repulſe. On the other ſides of the towne, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally towards the gates where the place was more plaine and open, and where the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and falling of the ground did ſeeme more eaſie and pleaſant for the ſouldiours; there the Aſappi with their targets and pauiſhes were placed round about in the forefront: behind them were appointed two great and choſen ſquadrons of harga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſſiers and croſſe-bowes who with the thicke ſhowers (as it were) of their quarels
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:13368:85"/>
and deadly bullets, might make them within to quit and abandon the defence of their walles: to the intent the Ianiſſaries, who followed after them, might the more eaſily carie the place, and make themſelues maiſters of the towne by the helpe of their ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ladders: with the which they preſſed forwarde ſo furiouſly, and with a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſo reſolute and obſtinate, that forgetting all care and feare both of wounds, or yet of death: ſome of them whole and ſound, others wounded and may med in their approch to the walles, were now gotten vp and had laid hold vppon the toppe of the battelments. For on that ſide, the walles had not felt the diueliſh rage and furie of the Cannon: neither had they any other helpe or receipt (as it appeared) to carrie the place but onely by a ſcalado. But notwithſtanding all this their labour and ſtriuing, by how much the higher they were gotten from the ground in skaling of the walles, ſo much the leſſe force had they to keep their ſtand. For many of them being ouerborne with their proper weight, and the burthen of their owne heauineſſe, did tumble downe to the ground with their heeles vpwardes, and their ladders vpon them, the ſame being broken with the ouergreat weight of thoſe that clymed on them. Others hauing their fingers cut off, were enforced to forgo their hold: and ſo their weapons falling firſt out of their hands, themſelues followed after, and their bodies tumbled likewiſe. But the chief and principall furie of the fight was with ſtones and ſuch like, which being caſt downe from alofte with exceeding great noyſe and offence, did mightily both ſpoile and encomber the aſſailants, their armour, and all other their furniture. How beit though there fell continually innumerable with their heades downewards, yet was the number of the aſſailants nothing diminiſhed, but ſtill there came others freſh and luſtie in the place of thoſe which were wounded or wearied, who ſucceeding into their roomes, did ſtill maintaine the aſſault, ruſhing furiouſly ouer the carkaſſes, and through the bloud of thoſe that lay dead, with a greater deſire of reuenge, then of any great hope to preuaile: and without any apprehenſion or feare of death, and with an herrible noiſe and tumult, they made haſt to ſeize on the battel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and by their ouermuch haſtineſſe &amp; ſtriuing to mount ech before other (eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one not being able to get vp with the firſt) the one of them did (as it fell out) hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and hurt the other. Concerning the beſieged, as they had no want of armes and munition, ſo you may imagine that their force and ſtrength did no way faile them: beſides that, the place did greatly fauor them in all points, and did ſeeme to yeeld ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour vnto it ſelfe. Moreouer they had certaine pauiſhes and thicke plancks extended in the forme of bucklers to keepe off the ſhot and blowes of the enemie, to the intent that the ſouldiers ſtanding behind them cloſe and in couert, might the better main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the defence of the places aſſigned them: and euerie man might the more frankly employ himſelfe to the diſcharge of his deuoire and dutie. Many of the Turks might haue bene taken aliue, by reaſon that their ladders being exceeding long and high, their bodies were euen aboue the toppes of the walles: and ſome of them alſo hauing left their armour behind them were mounted vp vnarmed: becauſe the waight ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would haue hindred them, if they had come otherwiſe to the aſſault. But no man had any mind or care of the liuing more then of the dead: for feare leaſt if in the heat and furie of the fight, they ſhould haue had anie deſire to reſerue the enemies for their<note place="margin">Turks repulſed from the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault of Sfeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade.</note> priſoners, or to couet after gaine and bootie, the towne might haue bene fooliſhly loſt by their negligence and auarice. This was in a maner the whole proofe of the valure and deuoire ſhewed by the Barbarians in the firſt and ſecond aſſault, from the which ſeeing themſelues repulſed with ſhame and ignominie: and beginning now to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue their bootles and vaine aſſaies, and their fooliſh deſire how they ran headlong to ſeeke their owne deaths, euerie man comming to conſider his proper wounds, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:13368:85"/>
the ſtreames of bloud which ran downe their bodies: then (their corages being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what abated) they began to mitigate their furious and beaſtly fiercenes, their blowes grew to be more faint: and they fought not with their wonted ſtomack, their choller was well cooled, and they went not ſo hotly on to the aſſault, becauſe by litle and litle their forces failed them: and (as it is commonly ſeene) men going continually vpwards and mounting ſtill aloft, do waxe faint and weary, and do looſe their breath in going. Notwithſtanding the Baſſaes &amp; other the roial leaders being at their backs, ſolliciting and encoraging them, ſometimes with good words, and ſometimes with rough ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and menaces, did enforce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (weary as they were) to paſſe on againſt the enemy: and if any were ouerſlow and lazy in their march, they would with blowes driue and force them on, beating them with cudgels or baſtinados in moſt cruell maner. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon thus conſtrained, they went on again to the aſſault; &amp; drawing on their fainting and wearied bodies againſt the enemy, they came to the wals almoſt tired: where they continued in fight, though to no great purpoſe, til by litle &amp; litle growing to be ſpent, they yeelded vp their miſerable ghoſts in the ſight of the Chriſtians. Many of them (as their ſoules were departing from their bodies) being dragged away by the feete, their fellowes (whileſt they endeuored by ſo charitable a deed to conuay them to their tents &amp; to ſaue them from the fury of the citizens) prouiding for others better then for their owne ſafety, were themſelues mortally wounded from the wals: by meanes whereof they tumbled and fell vpon their companions half dead &amp; almoſt breathles: and were reduced to the ſame, if not to a worſe plight &amp; condition. The Sfetigradians the meane while aloft vpon the wals making ſhew by their loud clamors and pleaſant ieſts, that they were the victors, did with open mouth mocke &amp; deride the aſſailants, which did not a litle exaſperate their griefe, and renue the ſorrow of their miſchaunce.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sultan</hi> himſelfe being not able to endure this iniury, nor to ſuffer it without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge,<note place="margin">Feribaſſa ſent with a new ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Immediatly hereupon the noiſe grew to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed within the towne, and their ſtill ſilence arguing a new feare &amp; doubt, did recall the ſoldier to a more difficult and harder peece of ſeruice, &amp; to the beginning of a new labor. Wherfore both the ſpirits and the eies of all men were intentiue to receiue, and to repell the aſſailantes, and to trouble them in their proceeding, keeping them aloofe from the wals at the beginning, with force of arrows, quarrels, harguebuſſe, &amp; all other kind of ſhot, whereby they might be hindered from making their approches. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing that notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding al their deuoir, they marched cloſe on with their enſigns without all fear, and that they made rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly to the wals; they threw downe vpon them huge peeces of timber, and ſtore of ſtones both ſmall and great, beſides artificiall fires, as baskets and fagots nointed with oile and pitch, and ſo ſet on fire: in ſuch ſort that the Infidels being ſore terrified with the fiercenes of the fire, whileſt ſome of them haſted to quench it, and others to auoid it, they could not preſent any great number of lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders againſt the wall: and of thoſe which were ſet vp, the moſt part were burnt and fired. During this contention and confuſed noiſe, their commander himſelfe with part of his troupes, ſomewhat remoued from thence, hauing ſlaine ſome of the defendantes, had raiſed vp ladders againſt that part of the wall, where fighting eagerly &amp; incenſing his ſouldiers with often admonitions, he encoraged the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to enter in on that ſide which was almoſt naked and void of defence. There wanted not in the ſoldier obedience nor readines, nor in the common ſort forwardnes or corage: but of themſelues they were ſufficiently enflamed. For al of them pricked on with an exceeding fury, &amp; almoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:13368:86"/>
as if the one of them had enuied the other) they did ſtriue to purchaſe the credit to be the firſt man that ſhould enter: well knowing what high fortune and rewardes, (beſides the crowne due vnto him that firſt got vpon the wall) were prepared for that man that could attaine therunto. But <hi>Perlat</hi> with a good number of Dibrians, running ſpeedily to the place, and filling it with freſh men in ſtead ofthoſe which had bin ſlain, did ſoone diſappoint both the exhortations of the Turkiſhe commander, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuors of the ſouldiers. For bringing a whole ſhoure and tempeſt (as it were) of ſhot v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, both the aſſailants were by that meanes oppreſſed, and all their engines and other prouiſions were broken in ſunder and diſperſed. Therupon began the cry to be renued within the towne, &amp; the Infidels were repulſed with greater fear then danger: for but 30. were ſlaine of that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, and about 18. of them wounded. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, they deſiſted not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> purſuing the aſſault by all other means, till ſuch time as they heard the retrait ſounded: and yet was it only a meere obſtinacy and a moſt wilful hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor that made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo to perſeuer: and ſhame rather then corage preſſed them forwards on al parts: ſo that the Chriſtians had good and ſufficient leiſure to refreſh them ſelues.</p>
            <p>But the ſodaine comming of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> did ſoone after yeelde them ſome more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage<note place="margin">Scanderbeg go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to inuade the campe of the Turke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sfetigrade</note> to refreſh them: for the approch of their friends gan now to be diſcouered, &amp; the thicknes of the duſt with the great noiſe made through the trampling of their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, did euidently bewray their comming to the eies and eares of euery man. The long ſtay of our men (for before their arriuall the aſſault had continued more then 3. long houres) grew vppon this occaſion: becauſe after many opinions debated in counſell, it had bene aduiſed as the ſureſt and ſafeſt courſe, that the firſt onſet to be giuen vpon the enemy, ſhould be protracted a while: till ſuch time as the Turkes hauing left their tents void &amp; empty, ſhould employ the forces of their whole camp againſt <hi>Sfetigrade,</hi> and that euery man ſhould be buſied in his particular charge and duty, ſuppoſing that then would be the fitteſt time to make them yeeld an accompt of their expedition, and to quit the aſſault which they had vndertaken. But the prouident <hi>Ottoman</hi> was not found ſo negligent and ſleeping, neither did this Emperour (being ſo wiſe and polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke) ſhew himſelfe faulty in ſo groſſe an ouerſight &amp; abſurdity, as to make head with his chiefeſt ſtrength againſt the towne, and to leaue his back bare &amp; open in the mean time to the mercy of the Albanois. For the truth is, he had placed a ſtrong &amp; mighty court of gard about 500. paces from the wals: in the midſt whereof himſelfe ſtood en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironned<note place="margin">Amurath his pollicy and great proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> with his ordinary gard, both as a ſurueior and encourager of his people; and beſides he had prouided a ſtrong battallion of yong men purpoſely picked and choſen to the number of 15000. all horſemen, to whom he had giuen in charge to courſe vp and downe, and to diſcouer all places, and on all partes, for feare leaſt ſome ſtur and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult might be raiſed behinde them at their backes. Nowe <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> hauing gotten within 2. miles of the enemy with 7000. good horſe, &amp; 3000. foote, he had according to his cuſtome, made a deuiſion of his companies, appointing <hi>Moſes</hi> to lie in an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcado with all his footmen, and 2000. horſe, to preuent the diuerſe inconueniences which might fortune to befall him. He himſelfe with the reſt of his horſemen, taking the wide and open champion, did march on with great fury and violence againſt the enemy, and with a great and notable cry before he came to the encounter, he added corage to the beſieged, &amp; diſcomforted the aſſailants. Therewithall the Battallion roi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all<note place="margin">Conflict of Sca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The Albanois nothing abaſhed at their great multitude, but keeping cloſe in good order of battell, went to the charge with ſuch brauery, that at the verie firſt onſet, they beate them backe and diſordered them: and many of them being enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:13368:86"/>
in fight together, did with their ſwords or cimitaries rudely and fiercely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine each other. The Infidels holding good for a time, by reaſon of their numbers only, did within a while recuile all together, and caſting away all ſhame by a fearefull kinde of flight, by litle and litle did ſeeme to confeſſe, that the Epirots were no men for them to deale withall. Whereof as ſoone as their Prince had knowledge, and ſeeing that he fought on all ſides with ſo great misfortune and bad ſucceſſe, (as if God himſelf had bene againſt him) he commanded preſently to ſound a retrait: and pointing with his finger to the ſmall number of the Chriſtians, he ſpake thus vnto his ſouldiers.</p>
            <p>What a ſhame and reproach is this (ꝙ he?) what? hath ſo ſmall a troupe of theeues<q>

Nay, I my ſelfe haue ſeene it alſo, which (if you were men of any valour) would make you bluſhe for verie ſhame. What? haue your enemies, euen the Gods at their command? and do they cary victory with them in their boſomes? and haue you nothing but your ſwordes (and thoſe vnprofitable) and your hands dead and without life, and your bodies feeble and ſubiect to the ſword and iniuries of your enemies? Behold how they do yet abide you and ſtirre not a foot from you, wherefore ſtay you? Can you endure that a handfull of ſuch baſe &amp; infamous perſons, ſhould preſent them ſelues as conquerors before your eyes, whom you are able to ſwallow vp whole both horſe and armes?

            </p>
            <p>Vpon theſe his ſpeaches and exclamations, all of them ſodainely turned their faces towards the enemy, &amp; euery man (leauing al other buſines) ran confuſedly on all ſides: and thoſe alſo which were on the mountaine deſcended to charge the Albanois. But the Prince of <hi>Epire</hi> would not attend them though they were almoſt breathles &amp; out of order: but retiring ſpeedily to the place prouided for his ſurety, he kept the aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage which he had gotten in that encounter, without any loſſe except of one only, and 3. wounded: and ſo came &amp; ioined himſelfe with <hi>Moſes,</hi> holding that the only way for his ſafegard from the enemy. Of the Turkes there were ſlaine ſome 60. or better, of which number (men ſay) that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> ſlue fiue of them with his owne hands. The Barbarians did not purſue them far, becauſe the <hi>Sultan</hi> doubted of ſome ſecret traine or counterwaits: and the rather, for that he had ſome apparaunt ſigne of the other troupes in the ambuſhment: wherefore he commanded them againe to a ſecond retrait. It was a notable ſight to ſee how in one and the ſame inſtant, the Barbarians on the one part<note place="margin">Garriſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Sfetigrade ſallie out vpon the Turkes.</note> did charge vpon the Chriſtians, and on the other part themſelues were charged at the backes by thoſe of <hi>Sfetigrade.</hi> The Turkes ſcoffed at <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> as he retired from the fight, and being not able to hurt him with their ſwordes, they proſecuted him with taunts and villainous ſpeaches. But <hi>Perlat</hi> on the other ſide was much more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and deſpitefull vnto them, and did more grieuouſly importune their compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for he not onely angred the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the hearing of his quips and fine girding ſpeeches, but he vexed them alſo with good ſtore of blowes at their backes both with pikes, ſhot, and other kinde of weapons. For as ſoone as he perceiued, that at the only name of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> they gaue ouer the aſſault, and deſcended a pace downe the mountaine, he (embracing the occaſion offered him with a traine of three hundreth men quicke and well armed) iſſued out vpon them with a great clamour, and playing vpon them with his ſhot as thicke as haile, he went on beating, killing, and chaſing them euen to the foote of the mountaine.</p>
            <p>Thus was that day moſt vnfortunate to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> and all his enterpriſes, for that time fell out to be vaine and vnprofitable. The aſſault was broken off, the enemy was
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:13368:87"/>
not ſeized vppon, but without any loſſe vaniſhed out of ſight. The audacity of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendantes was augmented and encreaſed, and the moſt part of the Turke his readieſt and beſt ſouldiers, lay dead before the walles of <hi>Sfetigrade,</hi> beſides the incredible ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocke and ſpoile of his munitions and artillery, and other prouiſions for the aſſault. For the number of thoſe which were ſlaine in that iourney, was reckoned to be full<note place="margin">Number of Turkes ſlaine and hurt at the firſt aſſault of Sfetigrade.</note> three thouſand: and more then foure thouſand hurt and wounded, and infinit engines and inſtruments for the warre, were broken in peeces and conſumed with fire. This victory coſt the towns men the loſſe only offorty men: but of them that were woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the number was very great: yet was there an ineſtimable quantity both of armes and other baggage found before the walles, and caried into the towne, whileſt the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy was buſied in the purſuite of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> which was ſome amends for the loſſe and dammage they had ſuſtained. For that day the Turke gaue no other attempt, but retiring him ſelfe from before <hi>Sfetigrade,</hi> he ſpent the whole night in ſorrow and ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſilent and melancholicke. On the other ſide the Prince of <hi>Epire</hi> holding him ſelfe ſufficiently contented with this good and happy ſucceſſe, in that this diſcomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and repulſe of the enemy, did yeelde ſome time of reſpite to the beſieged, he made no longer ſtay there, then whileſt his ſouldiers muſt of neceſsity to breath themſelues. But he imediately after returned to his firſt campe where hee had left his baggage at his departure, and there his people refreſhed themſelues both with ſleepe and victuals. The next day early, the firſt thing hee did, was, to ſend away meſſengers, who rode poſt to cary the ioyfull newes of the victory of <hi>Sfetigrade,</hi> both to <hi>Vranocontes,</hi> and to the other townes and peoples vnder his obeyſance. He him ſelfe the day following with two hundred horſe onely, taking his way through the height of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, went to take a view of the demeanour and countenaunce of the enemie. All things were there in quiet, and the towne at good reſt: by meanes whereof, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his tentes, he ſoiourned there two dayes longer, and the third day truſsing vp his baggage, he remoued his camp into the vpper <hi>Dibria,</hi> &amp; there entrenched him ſelfe in a place ſtrongly ſeated and well defended, about fifteene miles from <hi>Amurath.</hi> The principall cauſe that moued him ſo often to remoue from one place to another,<note place="margin">Stratageme of Scanderbeg in often remouing of his campe.</note> was (as I take it) either for feare leaſt the ſouldiers (abiding long in one place certaine) might accuſtome them ſelues to ouermuch idleneſſe: or leaſt the enemy might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by take ſome courſe and occaſion, either by ſome draught layed, to ſurprize his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or to guard him ſelfe the better from thoſe traines which the enemy ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to entrappe him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amurath</hi> all this while being exceedingly malcontent for the vnhappy euent of this firſt aſſault, and badly digeſting in his ſtomacke the rude repulſe ſuſtained by<note place="margin">Sfetigrade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain battered.</note> them of <hi>Sfetigrade:</hi> after hee hadde now ſufficiently tormented his thoughts, with vaine conſultations, griefes, and complaintes, once againe hee called together the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of his rage and vengeaunce, charging them diligently to conſider of the ſite of the place, and on what ſide the towne might be beſt inuaded and offended. The place being once aſsigned, he appointed the ordinaunce to be planted againſt it, and then conſumed three whole daies in battering the towne on that ſide, thinking to haue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manteled it by the the force of the Canon, but their labour was all in vaine: for albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it on that part the flankers of the wall were beaten downe, and though fortifications which had bene made by hand, did tumble to the ground, yet the excellent and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall<note place="margin">Sfetigrade, her naturall ſtrength and ſituation.</note> ſtrength of the place, would not ſuffer it to be forced, neither by any violence or induſtry that could be vſed againſt it. For if it had bene laid wholly open, and no man there to defend it, yet had it not beene poſsible but with great difficulty, as (the ſaying is) by creeping both on hands and feete, for the moſt nimble and actiue perſons to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:13368:87"/>
it, much leſſe for men armed and carrying their furniture with them. So crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, rough, &amp; ful of woods were the mountains, ſo raggedly &amp; vneuen did they ſtand, ſundered each from other, with ſuch variety of turnings and windings in and out, and ſo ſteepe were their bottoms and downefals: that they made the towne being ſeated v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, both inacceſsible and impregnable. And againe on the other ſide where it ſeemed more aſſaultable, though the wall might eaſily of it ſelfe haue bene battered, and a breach made, yet right oppoſite againſt it, there preſented it ſelfe a certaine belly of ground, ſwelling (as it were) or riſing vp with a knob in forme of a Boſſe, which running out from the backe of the mountaine, did ſo fitly couer and ſhadow the wall, that from the place where the enemy lay encamped, it was not poſsible to plant their cannon, nor to manage their artillery in any ſort to offend them. But for that both the getting vppe at the firſt approach was very difficult, and becauſe the towne was too neare a neighbour vnto them, they did attempt it though often, yet in vaine: for the beſieged by their ordinary ſallies (being helped with the fauour of the place, did daily hinder them of their intent, breaking the engines all in peeces. And beſides, with their Cannon ſhotte and other artillery from the walles, they did in great ſafety and ſecurity diſappoint the enemy of their purpoſe, and diſturbe the endeuours of the aſſailaunts. Thus on all ſides was their labour loſt, and there was no appearance or hope of any good ſucceſſe, which might encourage the aged <hi>Sultan</hi> to come to the end of his deſires. Yet was he reſolued to purſue the ſiege to the laſt point: and by<note place="margin">Amurath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolueth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of Sfeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade by often and light skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes.</note> often and continuall skirmiſhes, to trauell, toile, and weary out the defendauntes without ceaſing: affirming, that this was the beſt and likelieſt way to conſume their forces, and to bring them to nothing: and that though the firſt dayes aſſault had coſt him dearely, yet hadde not the Chriſtians made any great good market, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their ſmall numbers, and that hee both durſt and would make further proofe of that way, though not by the venture and hazard of a generall battell, both becauſe the enemy did by his continuall and dayly inuaſions and canuazadoes keepe him in awe: and the remembraunce of his late diſcomfiture and ouerthrowe, did daily renue his ſorrowes. Thus were the townes men neuer aſſailed, but onely by looſe and light skirmiſhes: and the <hi>Ottoman</hi> forces did onely watch and lie in waite for ſome good occaſion, amiddeſt their often incurſions, ſodainely and vnprouided to ſurprize the citie. Neuertheleſſe they left not with their ſhotte cach to annoy other aloofe and a farre off: neither did they intermit or giue ouer any of the other ordinary ſeruices ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed and vſed in the ſiege of townes.</p>
            <p>Little or none at all was the dammage and hurt ſuſtained all this while, either on the one ſide or the other: neither was there any exploite done worthy of memorie. There was no new aſſault giuen to the walles, neither were the ſcaling ladders anie more vſed, till ſuch time as certaine Ianiſſaries, ſecretely gotten out of their campe, did perceiue that there was one place of the towne on the other ſide thereof, which being abandonned and vndefended, the inhabitantes thought not needefull to be manned, by reaſon both of the height of the place, which was naturally defended, and in a manner inacceſsible: and the knoppe of the hill being ſeuered and deuided, and<note place="margin">Turkes thinke to ſurprize Sfetigrade.</note> ſodainely diſtoyned from the mountaine. The matter being reported vnto the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> did make him exceedinglie ioyfull and glad: and therefore liking well of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, he ſent very many, ſome at one time, ſome at another, who by creeping ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing gotten vp to the toppe, were now a ſufficient number able to make a reaſonable good troupe or ſquadron. By good happe the gouernour him ſelfe went the rounde at that time, to ouerſee and view the rampiers and fortifications: who being ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily aduertized of the daunger by the next Sentinell, and court of guard, went pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:13368:88"/>
to the place, accompanied with a good number of choſen ſouldiours, and with great prouiſion of munition both of ſhotte and armour. And at the firſt he kept himſelfe cloſe, regarding and beholding the bold enterpriſe and aduenture of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: and he could not but greatly wonder at their hardy and audacious attempt, or rather at the great folly of this people, who durſt ſo to hazard their liues, without all care or feare of daunger. Hereuppon to the end hee might vſe guile for guile and (as the ſaying is) cut them ſops of the ſame loafe, and giue them drinke of the ſame cup, hee held him ſelfe ſtill and quiet behinde the rampiers, marking how euery one of them was buſily occupied at their worke, with their ladders raiſed vppe againſt the walles, and ſome of them already mounted, and others yet climing towards the top. Therewithall ruſhing forth againſt them with his onely preſence, hee ſo terrified and amazed them, that leauing their armor and weapons, and many forſaking their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions (according as each mans feare did leade and aduiſe him,) they began to flie before that any ſhot came to touch them. Many of them as they fledde to ſaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, were oppreſſed and beaten down with ſtones: all the reſidue in a manner, were moſt miſerably cruſhed and bruſed with falling from their ladders, tumbling downe headlong from the top to the bottome of the ſteepe mountaine: in ſuch ſort that their bodies were ſo ſtrangely battered and disfigured, that at their returne to the campe, they could not be knowen nor diſcerned by their owne fellowes, for that ſcant there appeared any ſhew or ſhape of humaine forme to be ſeene in them. Of the defendants, not any one that had any hurt or dammage. And during all that time, there was not heard in a manner, ſo much as one ſigh within the towne: for with very good aduiſe and conſideration all the day long they would ſpend their time towardes the place where the battery had bene made, and when the darke night came on, then woulde they fill vp and repaire the breach, with great ſtore of earth, ſtones, and other ſtuffe, ſtrengthening it with fagots, poſtes, and ſuch like.</p>
            <p>Whileſt they did thus by light skirmiſhes and conflicts incenſe ech other; &amp; that the<note place="margin">Scanderbeg ſcoureth the countrey.</note> Turks did rather enflame the choller of the defendants, then any way diſcourage or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall them: <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> accompanied with 2000. horſe did ſcoure ouer all the country, leauing no corner nor place vnuiſited, to ſee if he could any way finde the oportunity to entrap the enemy, either as they went on foraging, or ſeeking for freſhe water, or (which he was in hope of and might haue happened) that he might meete with ſome of their companies, ſent forth by the <hi>Sultan</hi> to ouerrun, ſacke, and waſte the countrey: but he was euer deceiued of his expectation, for I neuer heard, that either then or at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other time during the ſiege of <hi>Sfetigrade,</hi> any ſuch thing was enterpriſed or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken by <hi>Amurath.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> ſeeing that all his draughts did turne to ſmoake, and that he could finde no fit matter, whereupon to diſcharge his choller, he returned to his campe more agreeued then he went forth.</p>
            <p>It was now the two and twentieth of Iune, about two houres after noone, that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> (as one that hadde of a long time beene kept faſting from the bloud of the enemy which hee ſo eagerly coueted) mounted againe on horſe backe, and taking with him <hi>Tanuſe</hi> and fiftie other tall ſouldiours, he went about his ordinary and<note place="margin">Scanderbeg goeth to viewe the armie and demeanour of the Turkes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sfety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade.</note> wonted taske: namely to vnderſtand ſome newes of the enemy. Now it happened as he beheld their Campe from aloofe: that he found all ſtill without any ſtir or noiſe, nothing being to be ſeene that caried any ſhew or countenaunce of enemies, but the enſignes and ſtandardes onely: the men lay wallowing all along vnder their tentes, pell mell amongſt their horſes, (for it was at that time when the Sunne being in <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi> and in the extremity of heate did burne and broile their bodies moſt intollerably.) <hi>Caſtriot</hi> therefore ſeeing them in this plight, turned his face to them in his companie,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:13368:88"/>
and with a ſmiling countenaunce (as the report goeth) ſpake vnto them in this maner.</p>
            <p>O what a goodly ſight haue we here my friendes! See here the Emperour of the<q>

Hardly can any minde be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with this ſight, to ſee how filthie and vncleane a ſhewe they make on all partes, reſembling very beaſtes and brutiſh creatures. O that the great Princes of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome were here now preſent to behold them: I doe not thinke, but doe fully aſſure my ſelfe of it, that ioyntly with me they would ſhed teares when they ſhould come to meaſure the indignitie of their misfortune by the infamous eſtate, and by the vile habite, and baſe ſhewe of the vanquiſher. For your partes (my good ſouldiours) as you cannot now behold this filthie ſpectacle propoſed before your eyes, without the ſingular diſdaine and contempt of theſe baſe miſcreants: ſo (I pray you) let the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of this ſight be ſo deepely engrauen in your ſtomackes, and imprinted in the very bottome of your harts: that they may continue ſtill mindfull of your libertie. Go to then, let vs make haſt while the day yet laſteth, and whileſt the repreſentation of this ſpectacle, remaineth freſh in our memory: let vs returne to our campe to take vp our enſignes &amp; to arme our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions, whileſt our enemies thus laid along all at their eaſe, ouercome with ſleepe &amp; drowſineſſe, do offer themſelues as a prey to our ſwords and do inuite vs and giue vs ſuch oportunitie to the cutting of their throats.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This ſayd, he pricked forward and being fully repleniſhed both with hope and choller, he returned to his Campe, where without giuing any reſpite vnto his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours (ſcarce ſo much as a litle to refreſh them ſelues) and cauſing them to carie vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualles for one day onely and no more: with ſingular diligence he willed the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes to be diſplaied, and commaunded all the companies to followe him with all celerity. For the guard and cuſtody of the Campe, he left onely fortie ſouldiers: for the reſidue of thoſe that ſtayed behinde, were but vanlettes, and men of ſeruile condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A litle before the Sunne ſetting, the earth began to be couered with a darke miſt, during the which, the Princ of <hi>Epire</hi> with a ſoft and eaſie pace was gotten neare<note place="margin">Scanderbeg his order and policie in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching with his arme.</note> the Turkiſhe army, but he euer hadde ſome horſemen continually riding and ſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the countrey before him, to ſuruey and regard all places round about, and after their ordinary and accuſtomed manner of ſearching (by turning and winding, here and there on all parts, to ſound euery forreſt and daungerous place, leaſt there might haue bene laied ſome ambuſhment to ſurprize and beguile him, who was his craftes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſter in ſuch traines and artificiall ſleights of policy. For this expert Chiefetaine, either was continually in feare and doubt, or elſe he did purpoſely faine and diſſemble a kinde of feare by a certaine ſingular dexterity of his ſpirite, to the intent hee might make his ſouldiers more wary, circumſpect, and aduiſed, and the more attentiue to all accidentes whatſoeuer. And this was the reaſon (as the report is) why he was wont<q>
                  <note place="margin">Saying of Scanderbeg.</note> commonly to haue theſe ſpeeches in his mouth. That many more excellent captains &amp; triumphant armies, haue bene ouercome &amp; vanquiſhed by ſurprizes then in open and ſet battell: that he had rather fight againſt ten men reſolutely, and openly being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for them, then againſt two vpon any vncertainty &amp; ſuſpition either of place or any other inconuenience. Becauſe that all things whatſoeuer which are doubtfull
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:13368:89"/>
are more ſuſpitious and fearefull, and vpon aſuddaine do ſeeme more hard and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> was come within a quarter of a league of the enemy, he made a ſtand, being not minded to aduaunce his enſignes any farther, till he had firſt ſent<note place="margin">Moſes with two other ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours goeth as aſpie into the campe of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murath.</note> two ſouldiours (to whom he had promiſed a good ſumme of money) to the tentes of <hi>Amurath</hi> to ſee and vnderſtand the doings of the enemy. <hi>Moſes</hi> likewiſe voluntarily tooke vpon him with a gallant and chearefull courage ioyntly with them to be an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor in the matter: for that he thought there was not any great confidence to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in their skill and ſufficiencie. Immediatly therefore leauing their horſes (for that being on foote they might the moreſafely deceiue the Turkes ſentinels) he being diſguized in a varlets garment &amp; a Sclauonian ſword by his ſide went chearefully on, and was ſoone out of ſight, with both the other ſouldiers, who followed him without any feare at all. They in the campe when they ſaw that <hi>Moſes</hi> did not ſpare to aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture himſelfe in that enterprize, conceiued a ſingular hope in the matter: neuertheleſſe they ſtill expected in great perplexitie (by reaſon of the darkneſſe of the night, which made them ſomwhat both in feare and doubt) what would be the end of this attempt, and to what ſeruice they ſhould bedrawen, when this worthy ſpy ſhould returne to make report what he had ſene. Neither did the Dibrian deceiue them of their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for I may iuſtly ſpeake it) he did not onely compaſſe all the tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches &amp; fortificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the infidels, to take a view &amp; notice of euery thing: but he went euen through their inmoſt courts of gard, paſſing &amp; ſearching the moſt ſecret places of their campe. I am not ignorant, that ſome haue aſcribed the proofe of this hardy and audacious fact vnto <hi>Standerbeg,</hi> of which for my part, neuertheleſſe I will not robbe nor depriue <hi>Moſes:</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying in this matter (though there be no great certainty thereof) vpon the pluralitie of<note place="margin">Scanderbeg went as ſpy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Turkes campe lying at the ſiege of Croy.</note> opinions which do defend it: how beit that this was not the firſt time that <hi>Moſes</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited this commendation, neither was this peculiar to him alone. For it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied but that euen <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> did aduenture himſelfe to the like hazard (eſpecially du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſiege of <hi>Croy,</hi> with the like courage and good ſucceſſe, I will not ſay, counſell and good aduiſe ſeeing in this caſe there is not any thing in a maner gouerned and <q>gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded<note place="margin">Generall of an army not to be comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturing his perſon ouer hardily. A rare thing to ſee fortune, and vertue in one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be alwayes ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther.</note> by reaſon, but by meere chance and fortune. And therefore I dare not much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend in a Generall of an army that valour or vertue which is careleſſe &amp; ſo prodigall of his life and ſafetie. How beit fortune her ſelfe ſeemeth to haue exempted <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> from reproofe and blame in this behalfe: in that ſhe did continually ſo accompany and ſecond the endeuors &amp; heroicall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceipts of this worthy perſonage, that it was a thing very ſeldome ſeene in that age, &amp; it was a ſpectacle both rare &amp; ſingular to ſee a happy iſſue &amp; euent ſtill ioyned with counſell &amp; wiſedom, &amp; that vertue ſhould be ſo atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by fortune. But we ſhall haue occaſion elſewhere to entreate of this matter: let vs now returne to our campe with <hi>Moſes:</hi> who being perceiued a far off by the court of garde (for the moone was then at the full and did ſhine all night)</q> they went to meet him and receiued him with infinite ioye and gladneſſe, and ſo conueyed him to the generall. Then might you ſee the priuate and common ſort of ſouldiours mingled pell mell with the nobles and chiefe commanders, all of them running in great deſire to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what he had ſeene, what he had learned, and what likehood he brought either offeare or hope. When it it was knowen that all was well, and that matters ſtood in good caſe, and this ioyfull newes being diſperſed &amp; publiſhed to euery one of them: <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> knew that the wiſhed houre did now approch for them to march on againſt the enemy: he beſtirred him ſelfe therefore on all ſides, and you might haue ſeene him ſometimes there amongſt the rancks and ſquadrons of his armed ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:13368:89"/>
taking order, both for the men and their armes. Now diſpoſing of ſome in the vauntgard, and others in the rereward, each one to his charge. And there withall he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged them with many braue ſpeeches and exhortations.</p>
            <p>Although (ſayd he) my good friends and companions, both the preſent time and<q>

This is the cauſe, that I do now freely ſpeake vnto you, and as inſtantly as poſsibly I may, I do pray and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate you, I do exhort you, and I do require you, that euen the night it ſelfe may ſhew you to be mindfull of your noble courage, &amp; to be mindfull of your honor &amp; reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which you haue purchaſed and continued ſo many yeares. For now cannot I be either a beholder or encourager of the valour or of the ſloth of any of you, onely the moon-light ſhall be the witneſſe of your valure, and your valure muſt animate and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you. Notwithſtanding the ſucceſſe and iſſue alſo of this nights ſeruice will giue an open teſtimony of your deuoire, and my ſelfe wilbe the particular iudge of your ſeuerall deſertes, when I ſhall ſee your victorious handes bring me the bloudy ſpoyles of our dead enemies, their enſignes encountred and conquered before their trenches, and the heads cut off from the carcaſſes of their ſlaughtered bodies.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe and ſuch like ſpeeches did he vſe vnto his ſouldiours, as it were in ieſt and meriment, admoniſhing them notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding in any caſe to abſtaine from the pillage of their campe, leaſt in thinking to ſatisfie their vile &amp; couetous humour, their booty might happen to proue fatall vnto them, and be the occaſion of their death and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: that nothing could be more pretious, neither could fortune offer any thing of better value to the braue ſouldier then the throat of the enemy.</p>
            <p>This done, and hauing made their praiers and vowes of all ſorts vnto God for the obtaining of victory, about the fourth houre of the night, hee cauſed his enſignes to<note place="margin">Scanderbeg gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a canua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do to the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh campe.</note> march, but the clattering of their armour, and the neighing of the horſes, did diſcouer their comming to the skoutes, before that they came to the tentes of the enemy: and they giuing the allarme to their Captaines, filled all parts with diſorder, tumult, and confuſion. Vpon this ſo ſodaine and vnexpected a noiſe, the tents of the Graund Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niour himſelfe were ſtriken with feare and terrour, and the old man being ſoone awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, as a man amazed and deſtitute of all counſaile, did prouide as well as he could v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon ſo deſperate an accident. But <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> for all this, neither ſlacked his courſe nor abated his fury: and although he perceiued by this tumult, that all the campe was in an allarme, and that the ſouldiers did runne in and out to the gardes, and paſſages of the campe, yet did he not diminiſh any part of his fury and fierceneſſe formerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, but with high cries and wonderfull noiſe, he inuaded their trenches and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications. The firſt quarter that was aſſailed, was where certaine ſouldiers of <hi>Aſia</hi> lay encamped, who being by chaunce the firſt that were encountred, had their tents and lodgings ouerthrowen in an inſtant, and themſelues as they ſtood vpon their defence being partly ſlaine &amp; partly put to flight, did draw on the like fury and deſtruction v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon others that ſucceeded in their roomes. For many who had taken armes in great haſt &amp; tumult, came to make head againſt the enemy, but being not able to make their party good, by reaſon they were vnequall to our men both in number and in fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they were quickly cut in peeces, or driuen to forſake the place. From thence the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:13368:90"/>
Chriſtians paſsing further on, they found diuers tents and pauillions voyde and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which they cauſed to be fired, and the cordes being cut in ſunder, they left them thus ouerthrowen in poore eſtate. Thus did <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> a long time continue victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious without any loſſe or bloudſhed of his men, till ſuch time as a ſtrong batallion of Turkes being rallied and gotten cloſe together, did come forth and aduaunce for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from the hart and ſtrength (as it were) of the Campe to repulſe the ſhame and ignominie of this diſhonour. Then began the fight to be doubtfull and ambiguous, the place was couered with dead bodies, and dyed with much bloud. For the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the Albanois making head againſt them with a troupe of harguebuſsiers and crosbowes and all his companies of archers, and bearing them off brauely at the firſt encounter when they came to charge him: he gaue them ſuch a volley of ſhot both with bullet and artillerie, and he handled them ſo rudely, that growing at the very beginning to be aſtoniſhed, and the night redoubling their feare, they ſtood a while in a doubt whether they ſhould preſſe forward or returne backward, neuertheleſſe tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting to their number wherein they thought them ſelues the ſtronger (for there were more then 14000. fighting men:) they reſolued at length to try the extremitie and laſt hazard, neither would the Albanois in any caſe quit the place which he had once ſet foote on: but marching ſtill on with obſtinacie &amp; perſeuerance, he prepared himſelfe both to giue &amp; to take blowes with like hardineſſe &amp; reſolution. For albeit he could not pierce any further into the campe of the enemy (becauſe the thicknes of the preſſe and multitude trouping cloſe together) did hinder them: yet would he not for any danger whatſoeuer giue ouer this occaſion of ſo notable a victory. Wherfore ioyning cloſe with the enemy, &amp; ſetting foote to foote, ſword to ſword, &amp; target to target, they came to encounter together man to man, and hand to hand, all of them taking good heede to keepe them ſelues from entermingling with the enemy, for feare leaſt in this confuſion and in the darke, they ſhould not be able, to diſcerne their friends from their foes. And their fight did ſeeme in ſhewe and reſemblance to be in the nature of a particular combat, for ſo eger and furious was their fight, that they ſeemed like mad men, and ſo vehement was their hatred which they bare each other (not ſo much in publique as in priuate) that euery one did imagine the enemy then before him, to haue bin predeſtinat vnto him, and therefore each man did his beſt and the vttermoſt of his endeuours to lay hold on the bloudy ſpoyles of his enemy.</p>
            <p>Now did it appeare on all ſides how notably the late oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> was fixed &amp; imprinted in the memories of his ſouldiers, and what effect his particular preceptes &amp; inſtructions had wrought in their harts: For on all ſides the Circumcized yeelding vp their ſoules, did ſigh and grone vnder the hands of the Chriſtians, and their throats (as they were cut a ſunder, did euen crackle &amp; make a noyſe through the aboundance of bloud which like ſtreames, iſſued from them: ſo ardent a deſire had euery one of the Albanois to ſhew vnto his Prince the heads ſeperated from the carcaſſes) as the certain &amp; euident pledges of their faith which they had giuen him, &amp; the aſſured markes of their prowes &amp; vertue. But our men did not lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g enioy this libertie of killing &amp; maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cring: becauſe the Turkes (ſeeing how their batallion was preſſed &amp; ill entreated) did now retire on all ſides, both thoſe which were whole, &amp; thoſe that were wounded, all together: and they conueyed themſelues into the moſt ſecure and ſafeſt places of their campe eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the lodging of their Prince. By this time their whole army being drawn out of the ſeuerall quarters of their campe, &amp; orderly raunged) as the time &amp; tumult would permit) they made towards the place of the combat, where purpoſing to haue done their beſt againſt the Chriſtians, their comming was not ſo furious and ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent as it was in vayne and vnprofitable, for they euen vpon the firſt flight of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:13368:90"/>
being partly wearied and partly ſatisfied with the ſlaughter, were departed. And albeit they were ſcant a mile from thence, yet durſt none of them be ſo hardy, as to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after them for feare of ambuſhments. They remained therefore and abode ſtill in that place, till ſuch time as the morning light did diſcouer the horrible butchery, and the ſorrowfull obiect of the dead bodies of their companions, which them ſelues did bewaile with warme and bitter teares. It is generally agreed that there were ſlaine 2000. and more then 500. hurt and wounded: for two and fortie of the Chriſtians<note place="margin">Number of Turkes ſlaine in the canua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zado.</note> which lay buried amongſt the heapes of their dead enemies, whom afterwardes being found (though their bodies were ſtone cold and their eyes pale (as in dead men is vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all) &amp; though their members ſtiffe and cold had loſt their vſe &amp; ordinary functions by the departure of their happy ſoules) yet theſe miſcreants neuertheleſſe, through a vaine deſire of reuenge moſt inhumanly tearing them in peeces, did endeuor to ſatisfie their rage and malice, vpon the deafe and ſenceleſſe trunkes of their dead carcaſſes.</p>
            <p>This meane while the Prince of <hi>Albanie</hi> had gotten ground, and being paſt cleane out of ſight and hearing of the enemy; he cauſed his army to make a ſtand in a certaine<note place="margin">The fayre val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley.</note> valley which the inhabitants call the fayre valley, and was about fiue miles from <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath.</hi> There did he make ſome ſtay, to the intent both to breath his companies, and to ſet his troupes in better order by the benefite of the day light, as alſo to prouide for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that were wounded, whom viſiting one by one, he did gratiouſly comfort, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſpect of the dignitie of his eſtate, with a ſouldiourlike regard (as one that had bene but a meane footeman) him ſelfe did handle and looke vnto their woundes. All things being well and diligently ordered and diſpoſed, he diſloged thence with his<note place="margin">Scanderbeg re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth to his Campe.</note> enſignes diſplayed, and came to his Campe about the eleuenth houre of the day a little before noone. He had made the leſſe ſpeede, becauſe the wounds of his ſouldiours did much hinder him: ſo likewiſe did the extremitie of the heate, and the burthenſome cariage of the preye and booty gotten from the enemy. Beſides there was a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of priſoners both good and bad: for whatſoeuer was found within the enemies tents was taken and caried away. Amongeſt the reſt of the pillage, there were 230. horſes and ſeuen enſignes: but the heades of the Turkes, cut from their bodies, which the ſouldiours held and caried in their handes, as the notable markes of their priuate vertue, did ſingularly grace &amp; beautifie the fight of this triumph. And <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got not both with high praiſes, and rich preſents and rewards, to honor all of them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly and in publique. The priſoners were ſent into the next townes there to abide, till ſuch time as they were ranſomed. The enſignes with certaine moueables and riche ornaments, were ſent vnto the Princes his aſſociats: the reſt of the ſpoiles were graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and parted amongeſt the ſouldiers. After this for a while was the campe in good<note place="margin">Scanderbeg en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campeth in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathia.</note> reſt and quietneſſe, and they had leyſure to repaire their forces with new ſupplies. The third day being paſt, they remoued with bag and baggage, and all their cariage into the plaine countrey of <hi>Emathia,</hi> where they encamped.</p>
            <p>The wrath and anger of the Turkiſh Emperor did ſo far preuaile with him, that the ſame being conuerted into rage and meere madnes (both for the peruerſe misfortune and ſlaughter of his people, and through the deformed ſhape and aſpect of his campe: and ſeeing no other meane nor matter of reuenge, he diſgorged the rage and fury of his heart (yet all in vaine) againſt the beſieged, and againſt the wals of their city. For<note place="margin">Sfetygrade aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted for 3. dayes together by the Baſſa of Romania.</note> three daies together did the Baſſa of <hi>Romania,</hi> with a great and puiſſant preparation, enterprize vppon them, and as often was he repulſed, and with notable great loſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowen and beaten backe. By meanes whereof, as the hardy and couragious fierceneſſe of the defendants was encreaſed more and more, ſo did a vehement in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation and broyling rage more and more torment the heart of the <hi>Sultan.</hi> And
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:13368:91"/>
though his body were euen waſted and worne out with age, yet the exceeding vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of his ſpirite (ſuruiuing within him) did euen reuiue and quicken it ſelfe a new, through the remembraunce of the worthy exploites, and the notable deedes<note place="margin">Speeches of Amurath to his ſouldiors: encouraging the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to a new aſſault of Sfetygrade.</note> 
               <q>of armes which he had atchieued in times paſt. He told his ſouldiours, that the euents of warre are diuers, and that the vnconſtant humour of fortune doth not ſhewe it ſelfe in any thing whatſoeuer, morevnſtable and variable, then in armes and martiall matters: that all difficulties by deliberate obſtinacie and continuall ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy may be eaſily ſurmounted: that the ſtrongeſt Townes and fortreſſes are but weake and feeble: that rampiers and all fortifications are of no force nor of long reſiſtance: In briefe, that all things are eaſie to be compaſſed and effected, whereunto men doe frame their mindes, and intende their thoughts, and apply their continuall trauelles and endeuours.</q> With theſe and ſuch like ſpeeches animating his people, and giuing them therewithall large promiſes of huge and exceſsiue rewardes (ſuch as he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer made the like to any ſince the time of his comming to the Empire) the appointed a new aſſault to begin the next day following.</p>
            <p>Nothing of all this was concealed or hidden from <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> but dayly aſſoone as the Turke had decreed or determined vpon anything: he was ſpeedely aduertiſed of it, both by eſpialles which he had abroad of purpoſe, and alſo by the diſcouerie and relation of the Paynims themſelues, of whom many did dayly flye vnto him,<note place="margin">Turks fly from Amurath to Scanderbeg.</note> either for that they were wearie of the Turkiſh tyranny &amp; dominion, &amp; did deſire to follow that good fortune which ſeemed (as it were) to ſmile vpon this Prince fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by God him ſelfe: or (as it often happeneth) being drawen thereunto through the inconſtancie of their owne diſpoſitions. More then this, the franke and liberall nature of the Epirot, and his admirable prudence did ſo rauiſh the hartes of all ſuch as did repayre vnto him: that if any of them came vnto him, with an ill and frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent intent, and with a purpoſe and reſolution to deceaue him, they would ſoone alter their minds: ſo ſuddenly would he vanquiſh them with the regard of his bounty and with this clemency and benignitie. Now <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> vpon notice had of <hi>Amurath</hi> his determination, made no longer ſtay but till the returne of <hi>Moſes,</hi> whom he had ſent to leuie certaine new men for the ſupply of thoſe whom he had loſt in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſeruices. The reſt of his troupes in the meane time ſtood ready ordered and raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for the fight, as if they had bene to charge and giue battell preſently, and as if the enemy had bene in ſight to encounter them.</p>
            <p>The day being come which <hi>Amurath</hi> had aſsigned for the aſſaulting of the Towne, early in the morning the enſignes being brought cloſe vnder the walles, and the alarme giuen, the aſſault began euen by the breake of day. On all ſides where the Towne was approchable was it enuironed round about, and all places were couered with armed forces. For the monarch of the Turkes hauing publiſhed and made it knowen, that this aſſault ſhould be the laſt that he would attempt: he labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red tooth &amp; nayle, and employed &amp; bent all his forces &amp; puiſſance againſt the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants. And in the meane while to the intent he might preuent the ſodaine comming<note place="margin">Feribaſſa ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed with an army to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the inuaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Scanderbeg, during the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault of Sfety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade.</note> of <hi>Caſtriot</hi> from troubling (as he was wont) the courſe of his furious deſsignes &amp; ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, he gaue vnto <hi>Feribaſſa</hi> that braue warriour, (at his owne inſtant &amp; earneſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt) an army of 12000. horſe &amp; foote, for the encountring of ſo daungerous an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that making head and oppoſing him ſelfe, againſt the violence of his inuaſions, he might keepe him ſtill doing: ſo as his other troupes might not be diſturbed nor withdrawen from the Towne, nor the aſſault diſcontinued. The ſufficiencie of this<note place="margin">Feribaſſa his praiſes and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations.</note> chieftaine was great and notable: he was of a very good conceipt, &amp; aduiſed, &amp; full of courage, as one whom the continuall practiſe of deeds of armes had brought to haue
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:13368:91"/>
the reputation of a moſt worthie ſouldier and an excellent Captaine. Hauing recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his charge and ordered his forces, he neuer ceaſed courſing vppe and downe of all ſides, and ſending foorth his ſcoutes to diſcouer euen the moſt remote and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt places from the campe: and in great impatiencie both of choller and of reſt, and as being grieued and diſcontented, that ſo faire an occaſion of honour and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, ſhould be ſo long delaied and detayned from him, he did attend and expect the enemie with a ſingular deſire and deuotion: and did wiſh that he had euen then beene there before him. So mightily doth the immutable deſtinie of the heauens <q>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uegle<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> and blinde our eyes, and the licentiouſneſſe of vnaccuſtomed libertie, that it maketh vs oftentimes more hardie and audatious then either in reaſon or neceſſitie is requiſite. And ſo was it with <hi>Ferybaſſa,</hi> who being an vnskilfull iudge of his owne ſtrength and puiſſance, had long ſince determined to trie himſelfe in priuate and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular combat againſt <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi>
               </q> vpon the firſt opportunitie that he could get in the tumult of armes, and in the furie of the fight.</p>
            <p>By this time was a great part of the towne beaten downe, and certaine of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications<note place="margin">Aſſault to Sfetigrade.</note> ouerthrowen. The Turkes likewiſe had filled the walles with ladders and with all ſortes of weapons: but eſpecially with long and great hookes did they aſſaile and preſſe vppon them which ſtoode vpon the walles, whileſt that others (though all in vaine) did not ceaſe, by hollowe caues and mynes digged through the earth, to haue made themſelues way into the towne. There wanted not alſo ſome who caſt balles of wildefire into diuerſe quarters of the citie, (for as yet were not Mortyers in vſe, or not knowen at all:) but ſoone was the fire quenched by the inhabitants, who without ſparing their liues, did carefully guarde and defende the walles on all ſides. But the chiefeſt ſtirre and whole daunger in a manner was towardes the great gate, where the Mahometans by the helpe of a great number of ladders, and long plankes and bordes heaped together, had raiſed vp (as it were) a certaine tower or plotforme, by the which manie might get vp at once, and hauing once gotten good footing, they might afterwardes ayde themſelues both with their ſhotte and dartes, to make the defendantes to forgoe their places. The number of the enemies reſorting thither did ſo increaſe continually (aſſoone as they ſawe this matter inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) as if they had nowe founde the way to enter into the towne. Some brought great and long beames both to ſtrengthen and to enlarge this newe building: others made them ſecret lodgings in couert cloſe adioyning to the walles, and then brought diuerſe inſtrumentes, as pick eaxes, barres of yron, and ſuch like, to digge and vndermine the wall. They prouided likewiſe ſtore of arrowes, dartes, ſtones, and other flying weapons, by which they might oppreſſe the defendauntes from the toppe of this their building. Nowe beganne the heate and furie of the aſſayle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantes on ech ſide, in the other partes of the towne by little and little to waxe colde: and thither was drawen all the daunger and violence of the conflict. Beſides that the tumult and horrible crie of them without did make all things ſeeme more feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and terrible. Feare and diſpaire mingled together, had mightily ſeized vppon the hearts of the Chriſtians, who were very buſily occupied in the defence of this place; when they ſaw the matter brought to that iſſue and extremitie, that the enemy could neither be remoued, nor yet hindered from the obſtinate purſuite of their endeuors. For by how much the more they were repulſed and beaten downe and ſlaine, by ſo much the more did their numbers ſtill encreaſe: and freſh men continually ſucceeding in their roomes, did by heapes mount vpon the walles, not giuing them any time of reſt and breathing, or anie intermiſſion; in ſuch ſort that the defendants did not only now want weapons to repell them, but their force and ſtrength began to faile them.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:13368:92"/>
Perceiuing therefore that their reſiſtance did ſmally auaile them, and fearing the imminent daunger leaſt the towne on that ſide ſhould be wonne by the enemie: they ſent ſpeedily to call the Gouernour. But the brute and terrour running from one to an other, was alreadie come to the eares of <hi>Perlat,</hi> and had ſummoned him to make haſt thitherwarde: by meanes whereof thoſe that were ſent to call him, found him neere at hande, and comming to the place withall poſſible ſpeede and good diligence, and accompanied with a good troupe of citizens. For all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple both olde and young, being as men confounded and amazed, neither more nor leſſe, then as if they had heard that the towne had beene alreadie taken by the Turkes: yet (being in ſuſpence, and vncertaine of the matter) they ranne thither ſighing and ſorrowing, yet deſirous to ſee the iſſue of this lamentable ſight and ſpectacle. The preſence of this hardie and ſtout Chiefetaine, did at the verie firſt onſet beate them off that were mounted vppon the wall, and certaine ſtandardes of the Turkes, which were found raiſed vppon the rampier, were quickely pulled away, and with great crie and clamours caried into the market place, to the intent the ſight of this bootie might encourage and hearten their companions, and free them from their former care. One thing yet remained of eſpeciall importance, and that was, to breake in peeces and to beate downe this maſſye heape of woode, and thoſe great beames of timber which lay ſo neere the wall: vnder the couert where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (as we haue ſaide) the ſouldiers being lodged, did both vndermine the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations with pickeaxes and iron barres, and did furniſh the aſſaylants with diuerſe thinges needefull for the aſſault. Beſides the enemie yet ſtanding firme aloft vppon this tower, and preſſing the defendants with a furious and eger fight, did hold them continually in allarme, and in ſmall ſecuritie. To remoue this inconuenience, they got together manie heapes of great and huge ſtones, which they cauſed to be rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led downe vppon this building, caſting downe alſo withall great quantitie of oyle, vineger, and ſeething water, all of them boyling whot, which they continued ſo long, that with the force and violence thereof, and with the often ſtroakes of the ſtones, and other things caſt from aloft, both the plankes of this tower, and the whole frame, by which the ladders were ioyned and helde together, beganne at length to be broken, and to be laide euen with the grounde. In like caſe the other engines and inſtruments of the enemie, were broken and buried vnder the ruines of this frame: beſides more then a hundreth common ſouldiers, and with them alſo two of their chiefe Captaines, were cruſhed to death and ſmothered by the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall of this building. The towne being freed and deliuered from this feare, the tampiors being newly repayred, and the walles furniſhed and guarded with freſh ſouldiers (for that there was ſcarce any one left either vnſlaine or vnwounded of thoſe that were placed there at the firſt) the Gouernour with his traine went ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily from thence to oppoſe himſelfe elſewhere againſt other attempts of the enemie. For by this time the like debate and conflict was riſen in other places, and the Turkes did preſſe ſo hard to get the aduantage of the walles, that the towne ſeemed to be in as hard an eſtate, and in as great a daunger as before. Within a while after the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour his departure, the Mahometans (which had beene repulſed and beaten backe from the aſſault, by the freſh ſupply of our men that came againſt them) hauing for a litle while withdrawen themſelues from the wall: aſſoone as they knewe that the Gouernour was abſent (imagining that the former heate of the Chriſtians was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what abated) they beganne once againe to goe in hande with their former worke, and to vndertake the taske which they had beene forced to leaue vnfiniſhed. Raiſing vp therefore once againe their beames of timber againſt the walles, which were yet
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:13368:92"/>
fuming with the bloud of their companions, they ſeemed to giue the defendants a new repreſentation of their forepaſſed daunger. But their laſt aſſayes were no more fortunate then the former, by reaſon of the ſudden arriuall of <hi>Perlat,</hi> who with little labour ouerthrewe this worke but newe begunne: and the ſtuffe being ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yet brought together for that intent and purpoſe, was quickly diſperſed and caſt to the ground.</p>
            <p>In the middeſt of theſe contentions and varieties of fortune at the aſſault, there preſented it ſelfe another kinde of fight, farre more notable and more worthie to be regarded, the which was able to haue withdrawen the thoughtes, and to haue ſtaied the handes both of the one ſide and the other, and to haue made them (as if all armes had beene laide apart, and all choller and rancour quite forgotten) not to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue their attempt, but to ſtande ſtill wholly attentiue to the ſucceſſe of their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.<note place="margin">Scanderbeg commeth to inuade the Turkiſh campe</note> For now was the Prince of <hi>Epyre</hi> approched neere with his armie, and (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come almoſt within ſixe hundreth paces of the enemie) he was determined ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to breake in vppon their campe. On the other ſide, <hi>Ferybaſſa</hi> was readie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided to receiue him with the forces which the <hi>Sultan</hi> had giuen him to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. For he did not thinke that the Albanois had anie other intention, but onely by a faint and falſe allarme to hinder the aſſault that was begunne, and to make the Turkiſh bandes to retyre from the walles euen in the chiefeſt of their furie: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to preuent him in this point, he made towardes him, and would not ſuffer him<note place="margin">The battell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg and Feribaſſa.</note> to paſſe forwarde, till they had debated vppon the matter. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> feigning a kinde of feare, beganne ſoftly to retyre drawing on the enemie (who ſtill followed him) ſome ſeuenſcore paces farther: and then with all his forces, well ordered to the battell, marching againe forwardes directly againſt him, he charged him moſt furiouſly. The Turkiſh Captaine (who had beene euer deſirous of battell) did not in anie ſort refuſe him: but hauing ſeene the ſmall number of the Chriſtians, who were but nine thouſande men, or little more, (for <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> had left the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of his troupes, being but fifteene hundred at the moſt, with <hi>Muſache,</hi> about a mile and a quarter off for the ſafegarde of the others, if anie misfortune ſhould betide them) he oppoſed againſt them all his footemen and foure thouſande horſe, whom he placed in the front before them: and with theſe he made head againſt<note place="margin">Stratageme of Feribaſſa to encloſe Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg.</note> the Albanois, and receiued them to the ſhocke. The reſt of his horſemen with a wylie and fine ſtratageme, he cauſed ſecretly to withdrawe themſelues from the bodie of the armie, and a farre off to fetch a compaſſe about, to the intent they might get behinde the Albanois at their backes, and ſo, (hauing them encloſed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled on both ſides) they might ſhut vppe the paſſage, and bereaue them of all meanes and poſſibilitie to ſaue themſelues, and perhappes alſo take <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> aliue. But this olde beaten and expert ſouldier did preſently diſcouer the deuiſe: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leauing <hi>Moſes</hi> to maintaine the fight of the middle battell, himſelfe with a troupe of horſemen moſt readie and reſolute, ſetting ſpurres to his horſe, turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide to the right hande: where at the firſt ſight, hee ſtaied the courſe of the enemie that haſtened to haue encloſed him, and afterwards comming to handie ſtrokes, and preſſing rudely vppon them, he made them giue ground, and in the ende to change their determination, and to looke to their owne ſafegarde. There were of the Turkes more then foure thouſand horſe, whereas the Albanois did not fully make two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande. Neuertheleſſe, for a while the hope of the victorie reſted indifferent on both parties, and their courages were equall, though their fortune were not alike, for that there fell a farre greater number of the circumcized. <hi>Muſache</hi> likewiſe (hauing beene called foorth by ſome of the Albanois) had now charged the Paynims on the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:13368:93"/>
left hand, and with all his forces kept the reſt of them there employed. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner both the armies, being deuided tripartite, did repreſent on the one ſide and the other, the forme of three ſundrie fightes and combats. <hi>Moſes</hi> behaued him ſelfe wonderfull aduiſedly, and ſeemed to vſe rather pollicie then force againſt the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. For neither would he giue the bridle to the furie of his ſouldiers, nor would he aduenture them to the hazarde ouer haſtily: till ſuch time as he perceiued that the two winges beganne to haue ſome likelihoode of good ſucceſſe, and had made an entrance to the victorie: to the intent he might reſerue the ſtrength and vigour of his men freſh and luſtie. Till then therefore he helde the rankes of his battell firme and cloſe ioyned together, and with a kinde of ſubtiltie ſeemed to temporize and to prolong the fortune of the fight, till the comming of his companions. This made <hi>Feribaſſa</hi> the more fierce and inſolent, and to preſſe vpon them without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion: and oftentimes would he vſe to encourage and hearten on his ſouldiers with theſe and ſuch like ſpeeches.</p>
            <p>
               <q>On, on, (my good ſouldiers) vſe the fauour of the gods, take the benefit of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie, whileſt the ſwords of the Chriſtians doe ſtand (as it were) amazed, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt<note place="margin">Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Feri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſa to hu ſouldiers in the battell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg.</note> their forces doe growe faint. Goe we on to ſeeke out theſe heads which are vowed to the ſlaughter, and to cut in peeces their curſed bodies. See how they faint on all ſides: ſcarce can we diſcerne any tokens of enmitie in our enemies, neither doth their countenance, nor their voice, nor their geſture make anie ſhewe that they haue a minde to ſtande vppe long againſt you. Or (it may be) that they doe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely delay the combat, and attend the comming of the night, becauſe (as theeues and robbers) they are vſed to the night. It behoueth you to aide your ſelues with the light, and you muſt keepe them from this policie, and take that opportunitie out of their hands, euen now whileſt we do exceede them in number, and do ſurpaſſe them in valure. If we ſtaie for the night, the leſſer numbers will be equall to the greater, and the cowards will match the moſt valiant and hardie. But what do I blame theſe, or why doe I preſſe vpon them, whoſe obſtinacie will ſoone ceaſe and vaniſh as the ſurges of the ſea, when the tempeſt is gone and paſt? We muſt cut off their head, and then the bloud of the other (as it is but vile and baſe) ſo is it of no force nor reſiſtance. Where is this wicked fugitiue, the author of ſo manie miſchiefes? I my ſelfe alone will diſpatch him of his life without the hazarde of any of you, if it be my good happe to encounter him in the battell. And I will ſacrifice the bloud of this ſauage and wilde beaſt, (whom ſo many theftes and robberies haue made inſolent) to the ſoules of our ſlaine brethren, friendes, and kinsfolkes. I haue (my friendes) of a long time bene of this minde, and this my deſire is not of any ſudden or new affection. It is long ſince that my thoughts did ayme at this combat: and my ſpirit hath beene euer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed to ſeeke the puniſhment of this wretched, vnhappie runnagate. I will once make proofe whether this my ſword can cut well or not, whether that bodie of his be penetrable, or that it be fatall to thoſe that encounter him. And I will ſee from whence he hath that corporall ſtrength and vigour: and in what this happie war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour (whoſe fortune hath beene of ſuch long continuance) doth excell and ſurpaſſe all others.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In this manner did the Barbarian ſpeake vnto his ſouldiers, and then ſwelling with pride and furie (more then was befitting a Generall of an army) he went vp &amp; down<note place="margin">Feribaſſa cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg to the combat.</note> ſearching and ſeeking amiddeſt the preſſe, and caſting his eies on all ſides to ſee if he could finde out <hi>Scanderbeg:</hi> and his minde being ſet on nothing elſe, he made ſignes with his hands and with his voice, ſtill calling and demaunding for <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi> The ſouldiers were nothing diſcontented with the hearing of theſe vauntes: and albeit
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:13368:93"/>
the prowes and valure of the Chriſtian Captaine, did ſeeme vnto all of them to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible, yet did they attende neuertheleſſe with great deuotion (as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſort is<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> deſirous of nouelties) to ſee the ſucceſſe of ſo notable a ſpectacle. Beſides they were in hope, that (the aduantage of the fight and victorie falling to the one or the other of them) it would be an occaſion that the bloudines of the fight would be the ſooner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, and their labour would be the more ſpeedily at an end.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ferybaſsa</hi> hauing his eares ſhut to all theſe reaſons and perſwaſions, and litle or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing regarding this good and wholſome counſell, with a mind &amp; humor quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tratie, ſet ſpurres to his horſe: and being attended with a ſtrong ſquadron of horſmen, went to call for <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> and with a loud voice willed him to prepare himſelfe to his defence. The king of <hi>Epyre,</hi> albeit he had before heard almoſt the whole diſcourſe<note place="margin">Scanderbeg prepareth him ſelfe to the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bat with Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rybaſſa.</note> of his aduerſarie: yet not remitting for all that the heate and fury of the battell already begunne, but either diſſembling, or in reſpect of his royall dignitie diſdayning him, he would ſcarce turne his face towards him. But when he ſaw the victorie already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyning vnto him, and that the barbarian did ſo preſſe and importune him: then his fierceneſſe being augmented with the new and happie ſucceſſe of that aduantage, he refuſed not the challenge: but being all beſprinckled and embrued with the bloud of his enemies, he went well accompanied to meete with <hi>Ferybaſſa.</hi> The fierce and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere countenance of the Epirot, whom the Mahometan had prouoked to preſent himſelfe there before him: the wings of his owne legions being then in rout and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and the loſſe of ſo many of his ſouldiers, might haue ſufficed to diſſwade this raſh and temerous Turke, and to haue bethought himſelfe better. The view and piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful regard of his misfortune, ought to haue terrified him &amp; ſpeedily to haue ſuppreſſed all deſire of entring into combat. Neuertheleſſe whither it were the neceſſitie of his deſtiny that did conſtraine him, or that the feare of ſhame &amp; infamy did reſtraine him, he ſhewed not any change of his firſt reſolution, nor bewrayed any alteration of his courage. Now in an inſtant both the one part &amp; the other ceaſed from fighting, and the fury of the ſouldiers was ſtaied by their Generals, in ſuch ſort that betweene both the armies, there was not heard or perceiued any noiſe nor any ſhew of malice and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie.<note place="margin">Speeches of Scanderbeg by his Nobles en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating him not to combat with Ferybaſſa</note> All things were ſtill and quiet, except certaine of the Lords &amp; chiefe Captaines of the Albanois, who inuironning their Prince, did endeuour ſometimes by praiers and petitions, and ſometimes by their importunity to entreate him: that he would not meddle with the clamarous and rayling beaſt: and they told him moreouer, that his head only after he were ſlaine, did appertaine to their Generall, but that his <q>ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter belonged vnto them &amp; was their dutie: that it ſhould redound more to his honor
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:13368:94"/>
and more aduantage the eſtate of <hi>Albanie</hi> for the <hi>Ottoman</hi> to ſee, that the ſouldiers of the Epirots were to be compared for their valure with the Captaines and leaders of the Turkes: and that there was no compariſon betweene their Generals. Beſides that it was not conuenient, that ſo great a Prince ſhould aduenture the reputation and honour of ſo many honourable exploites, and the glorie and renowme purchaſed by ſo many yeares: in combatting with one that was but a ſlaue and bondman to <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath.</hi> That it could be no increaſe or augmentation of honour or fame vnto <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg</hi> to ouercome this barbarian, whereas <hi>Feribaſſa</hi> by this act might grow more tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant and glorious,</q> then by all the deedes and demerits of his life before paſt. All theſe perſwaſions notwithſtanding, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> hauing highly commended and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled their ſingular affection and good wils towards him, whileſt he was preparing himſelfe to the iouſt: he thus replyed vnto them.</p>
            <p>God defend (quoth he my friends) that as long as this hand of mine can handle the ſword, and as long as this bodie of mineretaineth his wonted ſtrength and vigour,<note place="margin">Anſwere of Scanderbeg to his Nobles, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading him from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat with Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribaſſa.</note> that any of you ſhould carrie away from me the ſucceſſe of this aduenture: the which (whatſoeuer it be) I referre to him that is the giuer of all victorie. Reſerue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <q>theſe your offices of good will to ſome other ſeaſon when you ſhall ſee me aged and ſtricken in yeares, when my limmes beginne to faile, and when I ſhall aſſure my ſelfe that my ſtrength doth decay. At this time you ought to haue a care, leaſt whileſt you ſhew your ſelues too carefull of my life, you doe enuie my honour and reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And what would the enemy ſay if (according to your requeſt) I ſhould yeeld you the hazard of this combat: but that my holding backe and refuſing of the fight were but a meere diſſimulation of my cowardice, and a true confeſſion of a fearefull and faint heart, and that I durſt not encounter him, nor were comparable vnto him. For (to anſwere your obiections) it is not amiſſe ſometimes for a Generall of an armie to vndertake a combat as well as a priuate ſouldier. That glorious combat of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Great with <hi>Porus</hi> king of the Indians was it any diminiſhing to his honour and reputation? Did our aunceſtors euer diſcommend the fight that was betweene <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> and <hi>Pantachus?</hi> I will not here ſpeake of the <hi>Marcelli,</hi> the <hi>Torquati,</hi> and the <hi>Coruini,</hi> who with the ſingular glorie both of themſelues and their citizens, haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome their enemies that challenged them to the combat. Theſe are the hands that muſt vndertake this hazard: for me it is that the enemie calleth with ſo many mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and brauadoes: to me it is that this cruell beaſt ſpeaketh. I could do litle if I ſhould refuſe him in ſuch a matter, and he might thinke me very vnkind if I ſhould not ſatisfie his deſire in ſo honeſt and reaſonable a requeſt. He is a man of ſufficient worth to feele the weight of this my ſword, whom <hi>Amurath</hi> thought ſo worthy to haue the charge and commaund of ſo great an armic.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This ſaid, he ſent preſently one of his guard to tell the Barbarian that he ſhold make readie to receiue him: and immediatly he preſented himſelfe vpon the place aſſigned<note place="margin">The combat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg and Feribaſſa.</note> for the conflict, being conueyed thither with many acclamations and high clamors of his ſouldiers. The inequalitie of the combattants (the Turke not being compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in valure to his enemie) and his ſhort and ſpeedie ende, (for he was too too ſoone diſpatched) did make the ſight and ſpectacle leſſe delightfull, and made the combat leſſe notable then otherwiſe it might haue bene. For at the firſt courſe and encounter with their launces, <hi>Feribaſſa</hi> being ſtriken through the face into the head tumbled downe to the ground, and left both his life and his horſe both at once. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king<note place="margin">Feribaſſa ſlain by Scanderbeg.</note> no regard either of his bodie or of his ſpoiles, but returning preſently to his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, willed them to renue the fight, and to inuade the enemie a freſh. But the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels being enraged, would not giue them the leaſure: for aſſoone as they ſawe their
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:13368:94"/>
Generall laide on the ground, at the firſt they made towardes his corps with their troupes cloſe and firme together, thinking to haue guarded his bodie from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of the enemie, and to haue dragged him away by the feete. But being not able to<note place="margin">Victorie of Scanderbeg againſt the armie of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribaſſa.</note> effect it by reaſon that the Chriſtians ſuddenly comming vpon them, did hinder their attempt, they thought it better to withdraw themſelues, and to carrie the newes of their miſfortune vnto their ſoueraigne: and therfore turning their backes, they fled away with might &amp; maine, which the Albanois perceiuing (who were come thither with a full reſolution and good deuotion to haue charged them) many of them, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the vauntcurrers fell to the chaſe, till ſuch time as the retraite being ſounded, cauſed them to returne. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> ioyous and glad of this victorie, after he ſaw that all was quiet and that there was nothing to be ſeene but the footeſteps of the enemie, and the earth waſhed with the blood of their cold carcaſſes, preſently ſent the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſouldiers to gather the pillage whileſt himſelfe with the reſidue of his beſt and braueſt ſouldiers arranged in order of battell, ſtood vpon his guard for feare of ſome commotion that might be made from the campe of the enemie.</p>
            <p>This ouerthrow and vnhappie diſcomfiture being firſt reported, and afterwards<note place="margin">Amurath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth his campe againſt future inuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</note> perceiued by the <hi>Sultan,</hi> did ſo ouerwhelme his heart with griefe and ſorrow inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled with feare, that he ſtood mute for a long ſeaſon as if he had bene in a traunce: for he ſawe himſelfe ſo fruſtrate of his hope and expectation, as if all the powers of heauen had conſpired againſt him. But the violence of his paſſion by little and little leauing him, he prouided by reaſon of this accident, and tooke order for all matters ſo fully and in as good ſort as any Generall (were he neuer ſo prudent and expert) could poſſibly haue done. Firſt therefore he placed ſouldiers on all ſides, charging them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently and carefully to eſpie the driftes and counſels of the enemie: then drawing downe certaine ſmall peeces of artillerie from before the towne, he planted them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that part of his campe where the townes men did moſt vſually ſally out vpon him, and which was moſt ſubiect to the iniuries and inuaſions of the enemie. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer hauing augmented and reſtored the troupes of <hi>Ferybaſſa</hi> with a ſupply of foure<note place="margin">Number of Turkes ſlaine in the battell betweene Scan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derbeg and Feribaſſa.</note> thouſand men (for ſo many had bene ſlaine in the fight betweene him and <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg</hi>) he appointed them for the defence of the trenches and fortifications of the camp, expreſly charging and enioyning them, that no man ſhould ſet his foote without the trenches to oppoſe himſelfe againſt the Chriſtians, till ſuch time as they ſawe them entred within the campe: and that then they ſhould make ſome barricado at the place, and playing vpon them with the peices (which were placed there of purpoſe) they ſhould oppreſſe them with the force and violence thereof, rather then with the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding of their bodies againſt them: ſuppoſing by this meanes, that both his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ſhould be the better preſerued, &amp; that ſo he might happen to recompence them both for his forepaſſed and future loſſes ſuſtained at all times in ſeuerall conflictes. Thus did he make prouiſion to preuent all inconueniences, ſo as the ſiege and aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the towne ſhould not be any way interrupted. Notwithſtanding the courage of the Mahometans was mightily decreaſed and diminiſhed, their ſtrength beganne to faile them, and the force of their blowes ſeemed to waxe faint and feeble, after they once ſaw that the fortune of the fight did ſucceed ſo vnluckely againſt them, and that contrarie to their hope and expectation, the fauor of the field did ſeeme to ſmile vpon the aduerſe partie: and principally for that the vertue and fortune peculiar to the prince of <hi>Epire,</hi> had gotten him the good will and liking of many euen of their owne company: eſpecially them who meaſuring matters by their ſucceſſe and euent, do va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riably frame and conform their faith accordingly. For I find it recorded, that the ſame day of the diſcomfiture of <hi>Ferybaſſa,</hi> more then fiftie Turkes left the ſeruice of <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath,</hi>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:13368:95"/>
and came and yeelded themſelues to the Chriſtians. The honor of this iorney<note place="margin">Turkes flee to the Chriſtians.</note> ſeemed to encreaſe and (as it were) to yeeld a kind of nouriture to the forces and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of the Sfetigradians: whereof they gaue a large and blooddie teſtimonie to the aſſailants: who continuing more freſh and fierce then before, had made another aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault againſt the towne, notſuffering the beſieged at any time to breath and reſt them ſelues, till the darke of the night ſo long and earneſtly deſired, did ſeperate and part them aſunder, cauſing euerie man at the ſound of the trumpet, to retire to his quarter ſore wearied and wellneare tyred with their extreame labour. This daies iorney coſt<note place="margin">Number of Turkes ſlaine at the 2. aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault of Sfeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade.</note> the grand Seignior the liues of ſeuen thouſand ſouldiers at the leaſt, an euident ſigne of his miſfortune: and more returned hurt then whole from the aſſault. Of the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants there wanted 70, beſides ninetie two wounded verie dangerouſly, by meanes whereof their numbers daily diminiſhing, many of them grew to be troubled: fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring leaſt at length, the towne being diſſurniſhed of menne to defend it, ſhould be brought to that iſſue and extremitie, as to yeeld to the will and pleaſure of the enemy. This made them to apply all their ſtudie, care and endeuors more intentiuely then euer, to the repairing of their walles, to the building and raiſing of their rampiers, platformes and Gabions: to the intent the ſouldior ſtanding cloſe and in couert, might the leſſe aduenture his bodie to the blowes and ſhot of the enemie. One thing notwithſtanding did greatly comfort and encourage them though they were ſhut vp and ſorely trauelled: and that was: to ſee their Prince continue his good fortune and proſperitie: and that the armie of the infidelles was ſo harried, weakned and beaten with ſo many ſlaughters and rough diſcomfitures, that it was greatly diminiſhed and empaired.</p>
            <p>I come now to <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> and his people, whom I left making their benefite all at pleaſure of the victory which they had gotten, and gathering the ſpoiles of the dead bodies before that the <hi>Ottoman</hi> troupes deſcending from the mountaine, did giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer<note place="margin">The returne of Scanderbeg to his campe.</note> the aſſault. This done, he retyred himſelfe with tryumph for his double victorie, to his campe, where he ſpent the reſt of the night in ſinging of ſongs and other ſports. The bootie carried away was ſo maruellous, that the ſouldiers ſeemed not to care for it: but eſpecially they had ſuch plentie of horſes, that there was not any of the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in a manner, but had ſome giuen them. Many of them were giuen to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces neere adioyning, with other rich and coſtly preſents purchaſed from the enemie. Moreouer there were infinite marchants which came purpoſely both from <hi>Italy</hi> and other Nations, who buying of them for ready money, or for exchange and barter of other marchandize, did daily rid and carie them out of the countrie.</p>
            <p>The whole Prouince of <hi>Epyre</hi> began now to leaue all feare, and to be ſecure from the terrour of the Turkiſh armie, and the <hi>Ottoman</hi> grew to be little redoubted, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contemned by all in generall, now that they ſaw his forces ſo beaten, broken and diſcomfited: and euen <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> alſo was of the opinion, that <hi>Amurath</hi> would of himſelfe raiſe his ſiege from before <hi>Sfetygrade,</hi> and truſſing vp his baggage, after ſo many calamities ſuffered and endured, would depart and not make any longer ſtay in the countrie. Neuertheleſſe, he daily ſent out ſpies and others to ſound the counſels &amp; ſecret deliberations of the <hi>Sultan:</hi> but yet for all that he could heare no newes from the campe of the enemie. Wherefore as one that mortally hated idleneſſe, he made<note place="margin">Scanderbeg goeth to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vpon the enemy.</note> choiſe of 2000. horſe, &amp; taking the way of the mountaines, he went abroad to ſearch and enquire in what eſtate all things ſtoode, and he was in great perplexitie, becauſe he could not any way learne nor coniecture, what were the counſels &amp; intent of the <hi>Ottoman,</hi> nor what courſe he was determined to take. If he could intercept any of the foragers or vaſſals of the Turke ſo it was, otherwiſe he was like to remaine doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:13368:95"/>
and in ſuſpence as before: for either to inuade his trenches, or to come openly to fight with him was but meere folly: neither was there any ſurety to be hoped for by any ſuch courſe; becauſe he feared the number of the Turkiſh forces whole and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the engines which lay couertly prouided for the fortification of their campe: of the which he had had aduertiſement by thoſe that were come vnto him from the enemie. All this notwithſtanding he courſed ſtill vp and downe, ſometimes heere, ſometimes there to ſhew himſelfe to his enemies, and vpon the appearance and ſhew of his ſmall numbers, to draw him foorth to fight, in hope of ſome good and happy exploit. But all theſe deuiſes did litle or nothing auaile him; for that the Infidels (as if themſelues had bene beſieged) did not ſtirre a foote out of their trenches and ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers: by reaſon that the <hi>Sultan</hi> had pronounced the rigorous and terrible ſentence of death, to be executed vpon all thoſe who ſhould dare to aduenture without licence, either to iſſue forth to fight, or to make any mention of fighting with him. The Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banois ſeeing that matters did not fall out to his deſire and expectation, returned to his campe full of care and diſcontentment, there to take further aduiſe what courſe<note place="margin">Scanderbeg holdeth coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the enemie.</note> was moſt conuenient, both to deliuer the towne that was ſo ſtraightly beſieged, and to expell the enemie out of the countrey: conſidering he was not able to vſe open force againſt him, neither would he be brought to enterprize or aduenture any thing raſhly and vnaduiſedly. To ſolicite the potentates and townes of <hi>Epire</hi> his confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates to take armes, and with them to aduenture the fortune of the whole eſtate to the doubtfull chance of battell, ſeemed a courſe of litle or no ſafetie. For, put the caſe he were aſſured of the victorie, yet could not a matter of ſo great conſequence and difficultie be effected but with much bloodſhed of infinite of his people. Amongeſt many opinions propounded in councell, this was laied downe as the moſt ſafe and commendable, to continue the warre according to their accuſtomed manner, and that be ſhould ſuffer the power of the enemie, to vaniſh and waſt away, and to grow into contempt: till being conſumed and ſpent by their owne ſecret diſcommodities and inconueniences, and his forces growing from day to day, to waxe more faint and to decay, he ſhould voluntarily deſiſt from his attempt, and by his owne loſſes and dammages, might be driuen to leaue the prouince which he had ſo vnfortunately inuaded: that he had not (God be praiſed) any occaſion to find himſelfe aggrieued nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the faith and loyaltie of any perſon, nor yet with his owne good fortune: and that touching thoſe of <hi>Sfetigrade,</hi> there did appeare ſo many &amp; ſo notable ſignes and euidences of their good perſeuerance, that euerie man might hold himſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and his mind well ſatiſfied. Beſides that, the towne was ſo well fortified and defended of all things needefull for the beſieged, that they had not onely good ſtore of neceſſaries for their ordinarie vſage, but more then enough though they ſhould miſpend and abuſe them: and therefore, what courſe ſoeuer the Turke ſhould take, either by abſtaining along time from aſſaulting of their walles, or by giuing the ſame new and often aſſaults, it ſhould be to the ruine and confuſion of his owne people: or that whileſt they ſhould be moſt buſily employed and troubled about the aſſault, they might eaſily approach with an armie from the field, and ſo annoy or endaunger them within their campe, that both on the one ſide and the other, they ſhould reape no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſhame and infamy euen in the face and view of <hi>Amurath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things did <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> alleadge openly and in publique, making a ſhewe in outward appearance, and carying a countenance of great cheerfulnes and aſſurance: but inwardly and in his hart, his mind was violently troubled and perplexed with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe cares and penſiue thoughts and imaginations: and he did diuine of the counſels and practiſes of <hi>Amurath</hi> no otherwiſe then the iſſue and euent of matters did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:13368:96"/>
make manifeſt. He was no leſſe in doubt and feare of the ſad and ſilent behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, and of the ſlothfull and idle quietnes of <hi>Amurath,</hi> then of his armes and all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and he had reaſon: for he knew by long experience his naturall diſpoſition, and his ſubtile cariage and demeanour. He daily conſidered with himſelfe alſo, that gifts<note place="margin">Scanderbeg in great perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for doubt of treaſon in Sfetigrade.</note> and large rewards, were able both to aſſaile and to peruaile againſt any towne or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe. He knew that couetouſnes and the hunger of gold, hauing taken hold in mens hartes, did make them ſacrilegious and irreligious, and worſe then brute beaſtes and monſters. The conceit here of did eaſily perſwade him to doubt and feare euery thing, whoſe mind was full of ielouſie and ſuſpition: for he was not ignorant, that the wals of many townes, and the bodies of many men who had contemned all daunger of ſword and armor, who were vnconquerable by force, and againſt whom iron could not preuaile, yet had bene tempted and ouercome by gold and ſiluer. This was it that brought him into an exceeding feare, and an incredible miſtruſt: for his mind run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and diſcourſing of diuerſe matters, he imagined it a matter verie eaſie and likely, that in ſo great a multitude there might be found ſome one wretch or other of a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and miſchieuous diſpoſition, who being blinded and inueigled with the inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate deſire of gaine, might open his eare and be ſeduced to condeſcend to ſome infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and vile conditions of trecherie and infidelitie. And this care did not torment him for <hi>Sfetigrade</hi> only, but for all the other townes likewiſe within his dominions: but principally for <hi>Croie:</hi> fearing leaſt ſome one of his ſubiects traiterouſly diſpoſed, ſhould haue ſecret and priuate intelligence with the <hi>Ottoman,</hi> and ſhould worke him ſome miſchiefe and miſfortune. For this cauſe taking with him in companie no more then <hi>Tanuſee</hi> and <hi>Muſache,</hi> and about thirty other beſide them, and being diſguiſed in the habit of a ſimple ſouldier, he emploied all his poſſible diligence and induſtrie to ſearch out and enquire if he could heare of any thing attempted or managed to that effect.</p>
            <p>Thus you may ſee how the Prince of <hi>Albanie</hi> on the one ſide, and the Soueraigne of the Turkes on the other ſide, ech ſuſpecting and redoubting other, and being tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in their mindes, had both of them their imaginations occupied with diuerſe thoughtes and cogitations about the vncertaine iſſue of their affaires. The <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
               <note place="margin">Amurath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulteth vpon his proceedings againſt Sfery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade.</note> keeping himſelfe cloſe within his trenches (as we haue ſaide) did ſpend all his time in diſcourſing and conſulting vpon diuerſe ſubtle plots and deuiſes: for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that neither violence, nor menaces, nor a long and tedious ſiege, nor the often and continuall aſſaults of his ſouldiers were ſufficient to carrie the towne, but that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants did perſeuer in their former conſtancie: he determined therefore to trie his fortune another way, albeit there were ſome who counſelled him to continue ſtill in<note place="margin">Counſellers of Amurath are in diuerſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions for his proceedings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sfety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade.</note> preſſing them with his forces, and to holde on his attempts againſt the towne. Many alſo did aduiſe him not to proceede any further againſt ſo manie difficulties, but to bend all his forces to the deſtruction &amp; ſpoile of the countrie, and to make the whole Prouince of <hi>Albanie</hi> to feele the extremitie of ſworde and fire, the two ſcourges of warre: and to purſue the enemie, who being growen inſolent and arrogant with ſo many victories, did ſeeme to contemne all dangers, and did courſe here &amp; there wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vp and downe the countrie at his pleaſure, with a handfull (as it were) of raſcals and beggers: or elſe that leauing <hi>Sfetigrade,</hi> he ſhould leade his armie before <hi>Croit,</hi> where peraduenture they might encounter ſome better fortune: and (it might be) that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> would ſhut vp himſelfe within that citie, by meanes whereof they ſhould haue but one enemie onely to make head againſt them. For they were eaſily perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that he would not commit the guard and care of this place, being of ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to the faith and induſtrie of any perſon but himſelfe onely. None of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:13368:96"/>
could ſinke into the minde of the <hi>Sultan</hi> to reſolue vpon: but contrariwiſe he reiected and contemned them, replying (and that with good reaſon) that theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions<note place="margin">Anſwer of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murath to the reaſons and aduiſe of his Councellors.</note> of pilling and robbing the countrey, were but mockeries and childiſh toyes: for that the fields did ſcarce aford wherewithall to ſatiſfie the appetite of one onelie ſouldier, ſo carefully had <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> prouided againſt all inconueniences before their <q>comming into that prouince. No leſſe did he deride the fooliſh diſcourſe of thoſe, who counſelled him to purſue the Epirot: telling them, that there was nothing more pernicious and daungerous, then of a fooliſh and vaine curioſitie to entangle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in thoſe large forreſts and thicke woods of <hi>Epyre,</hi> being a fit couert for wilde and ſauage beaſtes, where no man could come neare them: but not for men endued with reaſon and diſcretion: and that the enemie himſelfe would deſire no better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage againſt them. In like caſe, to remoue his campe before <hi>Croy;</hi> he ſaid, that were to runne into new doubts and ambiguities, and to hazard themſelues to freſh ſubtilties and alterations of fortune: and that it was certaine they ſhould there find the Croians farre more ſtout &amp; obſtinate in their defence: that <hi>Croy</hi> had their peculiar and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Gods aſ well as <hi>Sfetigrade:</hi> and do you thinke (ſaid he) that there is any appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or likelihood of reaſon, for vs of a vaine deſire and meere fancie onely, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede any further in making tryall of their vertue and fortune, in a matter of ſo great weight and importance, which we (full litle to our profit) haue found to be ſo fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable vnto them in matters of leſſe conſequence? and in the verie beginning and (as it were) in the prime of their good fortune? ſhall we leaue <hi>Sfetigrade</hi> vnconquered at our backes being but in their borders? and ſhall we plunge at the firſt daſh into the verie hart and bottome of <hi>Albanie,</hi> and into the bowels of their realme, and beſiege <hi>Croy</hi> their capitall and ſtrongeſt citie?</q>
            </p>
            <p>In this manner did <hi>Amurath</hi> diſcourſe with his councellours, neglecting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting thoſe counſelles which they propounded, yet not finding any other courſe which could ſeeme more plauſible &amp; expedient: ſo that all things remained ſtill vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine and vnreſolued. But this was it that moſt vexed him, on the one ſide feare of ſhame and reproch, and the vehement indignation of his mind diſdaining beyond all meaſure to be repulſed, would not permit him to diſlodge and breake vp his ſiege. On the other ſide his miſfortune and extreame loſſes did diſſwade him from making any farther attempt againſt the towne. Thus did <hi>Amurath</hi> hang in ſuſpenſe, ſtill doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vnreſolute, concealing his diſcontentmentes, and diſſembling his extreame<note place="margin">Amurath ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to corrupt thoſe of Sfeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade with giftes.</note> dolour. Yet becauſe he would not lye idle and doe nothing at all, by litle and litle he made way to finde ſome oportunitie, and he ſought a farer off, to eſpie the meanes how to haue ſome parley and conference with the Sfetigradians: which in the end ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing compaſſed, he endeuored to allure and entiſe them with ſmooth and gratious ſpeeches, which are fit enticements for variable and vnconſtant Epirotes: and (that<note place="margin">Anſwer of the Citizens of Sfetigrade to the entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murath.</note> which doth moſt ſolicite the curious and vnſatiable minds of men) he aſſaied by force of rich offers, great rewards, and large promiſes, to perſwade them to open their gates vnto him, and to receiue in a garriſon into the towne. The Citizens gaue him diuerſe anſwers, which came all to one iſſue and concluſion: <q>that they ſawe no cauſe why they ſhould conſent to exchange their faith and fidelitie, &amp; to become corrupt and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loiall: nor to leaue the loue and fauor of the Prince of <hi>Epire</hi> for the yoke and ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a ſtranger: that there was none of them all yet that could be content to make marchandize of that faith: that they were all of them bound vnto their Prince with a moſt ſtrict bond, and in a fraternitie together, which they would continue whileſt they had breath. All this notwithſtanding the <hi>Sultan</hi> perſiſted ſtill in hope: becauſe hauing propounded ſuch large offers, he had valued their diſſoialtie at ſo high a price
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:13368:97"/>
and ſo exceſſiue a rate,</q> that it was able to haue corrupted the faith, and to haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted the alleageance euen of the moſt conſtant and beſt minded. Neither was he at<note place="margin">Amurath cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth one of the garriſon of Sfetigrade to betray the towne.</note> the laſt deceiued of his opinion, for the filthy and foule deſire of gaine preuailed with one of the garriſon, a moſt wretched and deſperate villaine of all men liuing to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred: who being corrupted by the large and perilous offers of <hi>Ottoman,</hi> did not care a button for the ſafetie of his citizens, of his countrey, nor of his frendes or kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes, in reſpect of his owne particular profit and commoditie. This wretch becauſe he would not be perceiued by the watch and Sentinels of the towne, ſought a fit and conuenient time to deceiue them, and to conferre ſecretly with certaine ſpies of the grand Seignior, with whom he bargained and concluded vpon the price and reward that ſhould be giuen him for betraying the towne into their hands. But fortune did not immediately preſent him the meanes to compaſſe his deteſtable and wicked en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize: but (the guilt of his crime, and his owne conſcience making him timerous) he was doubtfull to attempt any thing: leaſt his treaſon happening to be diſcouered, himſelfe might be the firſt that by his owne ruine and deſtruction ſhould incurre the danger of ſo execrable a conſpiracie. To breake downe the barriers or portcallys, to force or breake open the ports, and ſo receiue in the enemie was a matter of great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie, and litle certentie, becauſe the place was ſo carefully garded by the citizens. To practiſe with others, and to procure vnto himſelfe conſorts and companions, by whoſe helpe he might in the nighttime raiſe an allarme in the towne, cut the throats of the principall perſons, and oppreſſe the citizens being in feare and aſtoniſhment, &amp; ſo to let in the Barbarians into the towne, &amp; to poſſeſſe them of the place, was a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of as great impoſſibilitie: becauſe he knew that there was not any creature within the towne, but had the verie conceipt of any ſuch fact in horror and deteſtation: and he ſaw euen by the countenance of ech of them, that they were reſolutely determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, either by a glorious victorie to ſee their countrey preſerued, or if it ſhould be loſt and vanquiſhed, to end their liues honorably.</p>
            <p>The citie by reaſon it was placed vpon the mountaines, and ſeated vpon the toppe<note place="margin">The cauſe and ground of the treaſon, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the loſſe of Sfetygrade.</note> of an exceeding high rocke, was vnprouided of the commoditie both of freſh ſprings and of the riuer that ranne neere it. They had within but one onely pit or well in the middle of the towne, which long before that time had beene digged and built by the diligence of their aunceſtors for the common vſe of the inhabitants, but principally for their neceſſitie in time of warres that might afterwards befall them. The whole garriſon (as we haue before touched) conſiſted of ſouldiers that were Dibrians, who though they were a people subiect to <hi>Scanderbeg;</hi> yet were they not naturall Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,<note place="margin">Deſcription of the Prouince of Dybria in Epyre.</note> neither in name nor in language.

The higher <hi>Dybria</hi> is mountanous, hilly, and full of woodes, yet verie fertill and commeth neere
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:13368:97"/>
to <hi>Macedonie</hi> both in neighbourhood and reſemblance of manners. The Bulgarians<note place="margin">Tribullians of Bulgarians, inhabitants of the vpper Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria, bordering vpon Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. Tribullians or vpper Dibri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans hold of the Greeke church.</note> or Tribullians do inhabit it, a nation fierce and addicted to the warres, and as deare were they vnto <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> as the other, both for the merites of their proweſſe, and of their ſingular faith and deuotion. Notwithſtanding, they do vſe the faſhions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions rather of ſtrangers, then of the Epirots: and in many of their cuſtomes they do in a manner abhor the vſage and manner of the Albanois, by reaſon that they doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the ceremonies of the Greeks, and do imitat them in many of their ſuperſtitions.</p>
            <p>Hence did this abhominable traitor take the occaſion of his damnable and wicked purpoſe, for he knew and was perſwaded, that if the Dibrians ſhould once ſee the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſſe<note place="margin">The manner of the treaſon cauſing the loſſe of Sfetigrade.</note> of any beaſt, drowned in the bottome of the well within the towne, they would ſubmit them ſelues to the extreameſt ruine and deſolation, and admit any conditions of peace were they neuer ſo vniuſt and diſhoneſt, rather then they would drink of that water. And accordingly as he imagined ſo it came to paſſe: for the ſame night, this wretch hauing polluted the water with the carrion of a dog which he threw into the well: the next morning the thing being perceiued, the rumour thereof was in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment diſperſed abroad from one to another ouer all the towne: whereuppon there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a ſtrange murmuring throughout all the ſtreets of the city, to enquire who ſhould be the author of ſo deteſtable an act: but being not to be found, the matter grew well neare to a ſedition. The Dibrians being diſcomforted as much as was poſsible, did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely grieue to ſee themſelues brought to that eſtate, exclayming that they were<note place="margin">The notable ſuperſtition of the Dibrians.</note> betrayed, and that they ſhould ſhortly die as bruite beaſtes for pure thirſt and want of drinke. See the ſtrangenes of the caſe, there was not ſo much as any one of them who had not rather make choiſe to be made ſlaue to the Infidels, then to drinke of this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Some of them cried out a loft, that they ought to ſet fire on the towne and to burne it to aſhes, and ſo by a furious ſally through the enemy to prouide for their ſafety, or elſe to die valiantly. Neuertheleſſe of all other miſchieues, they held it to be the leaſt to fall to compoſition with the enemy. By litle and litle therefore their griefe began to vaniſh, and the noiſe grew to be appeaſed on all parts. Thus for a matter of ſmall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and a very trifle, was the fierceneſſe and couragious ſtomackes of the Dibrians abated, and their faith being now quite exiled, had left &amp; forſaken their ſuperſtitious conſciences. Now had the Infidels more eaſy acceſſe and liberty to repaire vnto them, and their eares began more graciouſly to encline to conference with the enemy, and now the ſouldiours in a generall commotion, without all care and regard of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<note place="margin">The Dibrians are determined to ſurrender the towne to Amurath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> and deuoire, did prepare them ſelues of their owne accord to goe vnto <hi>Amurath,</hi> and to demand thoſe ſhamefull and ignominious conditions, which of late ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly they had refuſed and reiected. The number of the citizens was much leſſer then the Dibrians, and therefore were farre inferiour vnto them in force and puiſſance: by meanes whereof they were not of ability either to put them to the ſword, or to expell the garriſon out of the towne. Beſides, if they had bene able to haue cleared the town of them, yet were their owne numbers ſo fewe and ſmall, that they did not ſuffice to keepe watch and ward vpon the walles: notwithſtanding (poore men) they murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on all ſides, ſometimes exclayming againſt their infidelity, ſometimes accuſing them of fooliſh and blinde ſuperſtition, and charging euen <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> in his abſence with their complaints, for that he had committed the care and ſafety of their liues, and of their city, into the hands of ſuch vnfaithfull perſons. <hi>Perlat</hi> being aſtoniſhed at their ſcandall, and ſuſpecting that this corruption of the water pretended, was but a meere fiction, and onely inuented by ſome whoſe mindes were inclined to diſloyalty, he did firmely beleeue, that there were ſome who had intelligence with the enemy. For this cauſe firſt he prohibited them to haue any treaty or parley with the Turkes without

Out alas! it maketh me euen beſide my ſelfe, and I know not what to thinke, when I conſider your pernicious conſultations, and this ſodaine change of all things, that ſo ſlight and ridiculous a matter ſhould be the occaſion of ſo great an indignity and diſcontentment. Doe you thinke it more honeſt to betray the countrey of your friendes and confederates, and to deliuer their wiues, their children, their dwellings, their temples with all holy and ſacred myſteries, into the hands of the Infidels, and to yeeld your ſelues to ſo great trechery and infidelity, rather then to preſerue the excellency of your courages, the purity of your hearts, and the glory of your faith, which hath bene euer admired? and rather then you will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file your mouthes with drinking of this water, be it (as your ſelues terme it) filthy and polluted?

All men will laugh at vs, the poſterity will wonder at vs, our enemies themſelues will deteſt vs, when they ſhall vnderſtand that ſo ſottiſh and fooliſh a cauſe ſhould make vs change our faith and loialty: that our minds ſhould be ſo eaſily with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawen to reuolt and decline vppon ſo vaine and abſurd an occaſion to ſuch notable diſloyalty and treaſon. Nay there is no man but will thinke (I my ſelfe ſhall be of that minde alſo vnleſſe you draw me from that errour) that it is the giftes and promiſes of the Barbarians which haue gained and corrupted you, for the deſire whereof you are now willing to pretend this excuſe, and to forge this for a colour of your rebellion: by the very obiect whereof (whileſt you endeuor to purge your ſelues to the world from the guilt of that crime) you ſhal confirme and make manifeſt, euen by your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion in the iudgement of each man, that you are faulty, and to be condemned for this hatefull and vnhappy fact. For what good reaſon can you yeelde, or what argument can you make of ſufficient efficacy to perſwade them, why you ſhould ſo ſodainely forget all remembraunce of your honeſt deuoire and duety, and all the benefits which <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> hath beſtowed vppon you? Are theſe the preſentes which you giue him (ô you Dibrians?) Are theſe the teſtimonies of your conſtancy? Is this all that you owe to the Sfetigradians your allies, who haue vſed you ſo kindly? I am aſhamed thus to ſpeake to men that are reputed valiant. From henceforth let vs looke for no ſecurity and ſurety in mens affections, no integrity, no vpright and ſound dealing.

to the inconſtancy of their occaſions, if (as trees doe with their leaues in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſummer,) ſo men doe ſtill put off and put on new thoughtes and affections. What would you haue done (I pray) if the immoderate heate and diſtemperature of the ſeaſon had altered or corrupted this water? Is it not ſtil the ſame water that it was? O daungerous kinde of faith! O the deteſtable inconſtancy of mens mindes! we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe and diſcourſe concerning the ſafety and liberty of this towne, as if the leaſt and haſeſt thing of the world were now in queſtion. Your duety were (ô you Dibrians) after the laſt droppe of your bloud had bene ſhed, to haue left your bodies to be trailed by the feere halfe dead, out of the poſſeſsion of this place: and not voluntarily, whole and ſound to reſigne and giue ouer the command of your glorious and good fortune. We our ſelues (if I may ſpeake it) doe inuite the enemy, we offer them our neckes, wee abrogate our owne liberty: and becauſe wee will not defile our ſcrupulous mouthes with a ſuperſtitious kinde of drinke, we will not ſticke to pollute all lawes, and all rights both diuine and humaine. Haue you not heard how <hi>Darius</hi> that proud and delicate king of the Perſians, did not refuſe to take a draught of muddy water at the handes of a ſlaue which had taken it vp (as they fledde) in the high way amongſt the dead carkaſſes, and vnder the horſes feete, at ſuch time as being ouercome by our countey man the great <hi>Alexander,</hi> he fled before him ſhamefully after that memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſcomfiture? As braue and proude a Prince as he was he did not diſdaine it: but after he had taken and taſted it, he ſware, that he neuer drunke more ſauourly: and that before that time, he neuer knew what it was to be thirſty. Thus did a draught of filthy water both keepe him from being made captiue to his enemy, prolonged his fortune, and preſerued the life of a great and mighty King. What will you ſay to <hi>Caius Marius</hi> that famous Generall of the Romaines? how hath the antiquity recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his ſufferaunce of hunger, and thirſt, at all times amiddeſt the extreame heate of fight, and amiddeſt his greateſt laboures and trauelles in any ſeruice at the ſiege of townes or otherwiſe? And to let paſſe the conſtancy of the Saguntines; what thinke you of the city of <hi>Petilia</hi> amongſt the Brutians in the time of <hi>Hanniball?</hi> did it not by an example of ſingular regard, and almoſt incredible, leaue a rare teſtimony of their conſtancy and fidelity vnto all poſterity? And to the intent they might obſerue their faith inuiolably, which they had giuen to the Romaines, and for the defence of their bare and ſore battered walles, they made no difficulty to liue vpon the fleſh not only of dogges (which you abhorre ſo greatly) but of all kindes of foure footed creatures, and with the skinnes of ſwine, with rootes, and with barkes of trees? The moſt noble and renowmed Athenian <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> to the intent his vngratefull countrey might not ſuſtaine the blame of his death, dranke (as it is reported) a cup of deadly poiſon. But perhaps you will ſay that the Sfetigradians are ſtraungers to you, and that their city is none of your countrey: it was deliuered to you to be defended, and therefore it is yours (ô you Dibrians:) <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> made choiſe of your faith and honeſty before all others, to ſee to the ſafety of this place. The towne which your Prince hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to your charge, it behoueth you to ſee it ſafe redeliuered into his hands. Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate therefore I beſeech you, and lay aſide theſe your deſperate opinions, and doe not you attribute that to force and neceſsity, which is indeede nothing elſe but a damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and peruerſe counſell and reſolution. For tell me true, (I pray you) what will you doe in caſe the <hi>Ottoman</hi> will not accept of the compoſition to graunt you your liues? would you then refuſe this drinke that you imagine to be ſo deadly? I am perſwaded that all of you would drink it, ere you would do your ſelues anie outrage. But now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are aſſured of your own ſafety, &amp; you are not in danger to loſe any thing but your faith, you are all of you touched &amp; infected with one malady, and your thoughts
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:13368:99"/>
doe runne a madding as men franticke and out of your wits. So little reckonning doe you make of your faith: &amp; of all other crimes, you hold it the leaſt to be touched with the crime of periury and diſloialty. I cannot (ô you Dibrians) commaund nor mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate my affections, I cannot abſtain from tears when I cal to memory our good prince <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi> Me thinkes I ſee how graciouſly he ſpake vnto you, with what praiers &amp; intreaties he recommended this towne vnto you at his departure, &amp; how euen in this place he implored with too much credulity, your deuoire and loialty. I do remember thoſe clamors and loud cries, which all of you made with brauadoes and magnificall promiſes both openly and priuatly. Where are thoſe your clamors now (ô you Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brians?) where is that fierceneſſe of your courages? where are thoſe hearts which you then vowed for your country? where is that audacity &amp; careleſſe contempt of life and death? I ſee here ſtill the ſame men and the ſame armes: but the habit and diſpoſition of their mindes is cleane altered. And this towne being brought to a deſperat point, I ſee all things in a miſerable eſtate and condition. Imagine that your Prince ſtandeth here before you in great anguiſh and griefe for this your notable treaſon: what thoughtes think you, will he, &amp; all others entertaine? what aſtoniſhment will there be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the prouince? what will be the eſtate &amp; condition of all <hi>Epire?</hi> ſeeing that from you doth proceed the root of all their misfortunes and calamities? ô that you would preſent before your eies, whileſt you are yet able, the indignity of this fact, &amp; that you would preſerue your ſelues for your ſelues. Ceaſe not to keep your allies and confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats in the poſſeſsion of their countrey, do not leaue to defend their liberty, &amp; to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine your own honor and reputation, which without any great paine or trouble you may yet eaſily preſerue. Regard the piteous &amp; grieuous lamentations of theſe citizens, regard me, euen my ſelfe, who (if you can abide to ſee it) do lie proſtrat at your feete. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how all of them doe offer their throates vnto you, and I mine firſt of all. Behold here my naked breaſt (ô you Dibrians) runne it through, pierce it with your ſwordes, take away my life it ſhall not grieue me: let my bloud ſerue for drinke vnto you (if ſuch drink doe pleaſe you,) and if ſo be you cannot by any other meanes neither main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine your faith, nor defend this city.</q>

            <p>With many ſuch reaſons and perſwaſions did <hi>Perlat</hi> vrge them, recommending vnto them the life and liberty (if not of others) yet of themſelues, and that they ſhould regard their proper ſafety: and ſtill he was in hope to haue remoued them from their ſtrange and pernitious purpoſe. And in the end becauſe he would know whether his ſpeeches had any efficacy or working in their ſcrupulous thoughts: aſſoone as he had finiſhed his Oration, he went preſently towards the Well, hauing almoſt al the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munalty<note place="margin">Perlat and the citizens of Sfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigrade, drunke of the polluted water, to draw the Dibrians to do the like, who refuſe it.</note> at his heeles, and in the preſence of them all he dranke a good draught of that water: the like alſo did the moſt part of the inhabitants. Whereupon it was preſented likewiſe to certen of the captains, &amp; chiefeſt perſons of the garriſons: but neither good words, nor good deeds could preuaile with thoſe ſuperſtitious and curious ſtomacks.</p>
            <p>Scarcely can I without bluſhing, either beleeue it my ſelfe or deliuer it to others for a matter of truth, that ſo light and ridiculous a cauſe ſhould preuaile with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a caſe ſo waighty &amp; important: and I make no doubt but that the poſterity will take a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleaſure rather to laugh at it, then to admire &amp; wonder at this ſtrange accident: and if they do giue any credit to the ſtrangenes of the caſe, yet will they hardly be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that ſo vaine and friuolous a humor could haue moued them thereunto. But they wil iudge rather that it was taken as a fit occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the ſouldiers, who being enclined to treachery and infidelity, had bene before corrupted by the enemy. For my part ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſearched and enquired of all things with all poſsible diligence, I could neuer find any likelihood to verifie this ſuperſtition: and therfore I need not make any difficulty
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:13368:99"/>
to thinke them blame worthy, who haue conceiued of them ſo ſmiſterly. My reaſon is, for that (as I ſuppoſe) there is nothing in the actions of mortall men ſo ſecrete and hidde, which could for ſo long a time haue bin vnreuealed. And more then that, of all thoſe who were ſo ſuperſtitiouſly addicted, there was not any one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer known to haue yeelded him ſelfe to <hi>Amurath:</hi> nor at any time was the eſtate of any one of them ſo enriched, whereby it might be preſumed or coniectured, that they had any fraudulent intelligence or ſecret practiſing with the Infidels. Neither is it any maruell that the Dibrians being once intoxicated with this fooliſh ſcrupuloſity, and being fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into ſo frantike a humor, did commit ſuch an error: ſeeing that they were not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giuen to be ſuperſtitious, but were alwaies and yet are reputed for Heretickes.

            <p>The Gouernour was inſtant vpon them ſometimes with praiers, ſometimes with promiſes of great giftes and rich offers, at the laſt, ſeeing all of them to be obdurat and hardened againſt his fruit loſſe perſwaſions, he framed and conformed his minde alſo to the exigence and neceſſity of the time. And hauing aſſembled together a certaine number, part of them Dibrians, and part of the chiefe and principall of the citizens to deliberat vpon the matter: they made a ſhort concluſion (for the matter would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any long delay) and themſelues did ſet downe the conditions &amp; couenants of their ſurrender, ſuch as they thought would neither be iniurious vnto themſelues, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable vnto the enemy. Namely, that the garriſon ſhould depart freely &amp; in ſafety, with bag &amp; baggage, that the citizens ſhould haue free choiſe either to remain in their former eſtate with in the towne, or to depart at their pleaſures. Touching the garriſon nothing was altered by the grand Seigniour, but for the citizens he would not in any caſe condeſcend, that they ſhould remaine within the towne. All the reſt was accorded and a watch appointed in the ſuburbs. Immediatly were the keies brought vnto <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sfetigrade yeelded to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murath.</note> and the place was rendered vp voide and empty of all the inhabitants. Some of the citizens (who were deeply affectionat to their countrey, and loth to depart from the place of their natiuity) did tary ſtill without the walles. But many of them who could not endure to liue vnder the Infidels, leauing and abandonning all, went to ſeeke out <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi> The traitor who had corrupted the water ſtaid within the towne, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with the enemy, where being knowen by them that practiſed with him to

betray the town vnto the Turke, they conueied him preſently to the tents of the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> with wonderfull ioy and great gladnes. You need not doubt but he had good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment: for the <hi>Sultan</hi> honored him infinitly, both with good words and notable<note place="margin">The traitour who betraied Sfetigrade, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by the Turks.</note> rich preſents, far exceeding the promiſes that had bin made vnto him, in recompence of his diſloialty and treaſon. For firſt he had 50000. aſpres giuen him, and three roabs or ſutes of apparell of excellent workemanſhippe and very rich. Moreouer hee had ſo much land of inheritance and demeanes aſſigned him, as the yearely reuenues thereof did amount to 2000. crownes. But litle ioy had the traitor of thoſe great benefites: for albeit he were thus magnificently rewarded with all theſe honors and riches in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ſight and knowledge of a multitude of people, and albeit hee did daily receiue a world of fauors amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the Barbarians: yet within a while after he was ſodainly gone<note place="margin">The end of treaſon.</note> and vaniſhed, and was neuer more ſeene nor heard of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The report went, that he was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly made away by <hi>Amurath,</hi> by ſome priuy and deſerued kinde of puniſhment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he durſt not repoſe any truſt or aſſurance in the nature and diſpoſition of him, who by a filthy auarice had traiterouſly conſpired againſt his countrey, againſt his confederates, and againſt his owne bloud and kinsfolks.

            <p>The garriſon of <hi>Sfetigrade</hi> was ſuffred to depart free, and without hurt through the middeſt of the Turkiſhe ſquadrons, which ſtood orderly raunged on each ſide as they paſſed betweene them. How beit that <hi>Mahomet</hi> the yong Prince of the Turks a fierce and cruell youth, who (as the report goeth) did then follow the army of his father into <hi>Epire,</hi> vpon a deſire to ſee the warre, and to purchaſe himſelfe reputation, did inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vehemently vrge and intreate <hi>Amurath,</hi> not to ſuffer them ſo to depart freely <q>without any puniſhment. And he alleadged, that it was but a vaine curioſity to ſtand<note place="margin">Speechees of Mahomet the yong prince to his father, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading him to violate his faith with them of Sfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigrade.</note> vppon the obſeruation of his faith, and that it would be to his eternall reproach and infamy; for that the Turkes haue not any doctrine more expreſly deliuered in their law, nor any precept more auncient in the religion of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> then to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by all poſsible meanes mortall enemies to the Chriſtians: and ſpecially to them from whom he had receiued ſo many calamities and outrages by the ſlaughter of their legions, the killing of their Chiefetaines, and the pitifull waſting and deſtroying of their army: that the Sfetigradians ought to be chaſtiſed to terrifie others, &amp; were to be made an example vnto thoſe which ſhould come after, to teach them not to perſeuere in ſuch peruerſneſſe and obſtinacy. For it is not (quoth hee) the office of an excellent Generall, to cary a minde mutable and chaungeable according to the eſtate and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the enemy, and to commiſerat their teares and petitions: that it were wel done to put them all to the ſword, or to keepe them in irons or ſtraight impriſonment, till ſuch time as they had order for their raunſome.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By theſe ſpeeches did this arrogant and proud Prince ſufficiently bewray his nature and diſpoſition, declaring euen in his youth and priuat eſtate, what manner of man he would proue one day when he came to riper yeares, and to the poſſeſsion of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. And the inſolency &amp; fiercenes of his tender yeares, did already diſcouer the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his auarice and cruelty. But the wicked and blouddy counſell of the ſonne could not preuaile nor finde any place in the prudent thoughtes of the aged father: but <q>ſharpely reproouing him, it is ſayed, that he thus replied vnto him; That nothing<note place="margin">Anſwer of Amurath to the ſpeeches of his ſonne Mahomet.</note> was more neceſſary and requiſite amongſt men, then the integrity of their faith, the which being once violated, it was not poſsible that either kingdomes, Empires, and eſtates or any ſociety could ſtand or continue. That euery Prince of a generous and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:13368:100"/>
noble minde, and of high renowme (if his hope and courage doe aime at honour and ſuperiority, &amp; to the compaſsing of great matters) this faith ought to be the one or the other, either in truth and effect, firme, ſound, and inuiolate, or at leaſtwiſe in outward appearaunce. For that is the onely way and ready meane to procure and purchaſe the lone and good will of all perſons: whereas periurie and crueltie doe ſubuert both ſcepters and crownes, both Townes and nations: and laſt of all they are not more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious to others then to the parties that vſe them: that men are conquered and won by the beneficence and liberalitie of thoſe who deſire to finde them faithfull and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, but that crueltie, hatred, and inhumanity do little profit a Prince towardes his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes. For when they ſee themſelues gouerned and commaunded by a proude and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderat kind of puiſſance, they will not long endure the yoke of ſuch dominion: that by clemencie the harts &amp; affections of many are ſoone gained, and being once drawen to like, ſeldome or neuer will they abhorre to endure that ſubiection which is ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious gentle &amp; tollerable.

            <p>Theſe things thus concluded and finiſhed, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> perceiuing that the <hi>Sultan</hi> was buſily employed in fortifying of <hi>Sfetygrade,</hi> and did wholly apply his minde to that worke: he tooke with him fiue thouſand horſe, and haſted with all poſsible ſpeed towardes thoſe partes with a purpoſe to interrupt and diſturbe him in his endeuours.

The next day at the ſunne riſing (hauing firſt in the night time fired their lodgings, and ſome other furniture of their Campe) him ſelfe marched after the others, with the reſidue of the armie who with exceſsiue ioye did make an exceeding noyſe, both by their loude cryes and clamours, and by the ſounde of their ordinaunce and cannons, which they made to roare with of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſhooting off at their departure. The Turkiſh monarch did euer vſe in times paſt,<note place="margin">The manner of march obſerued by Amurath with his campe.</note> and ſo did he then take his place in the middeſt of all his batallions, where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mounted vppon a white horſe, and enuironned rounde about with his armed Ianniſſaries, he needed not to be affrayed of any tumult or perill.

But all theſe loſſes and hinderaunces did <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> enlarge with the ignominie of a new ſlaughter: and he renued the misfortune of their eſtate with a freſh calamity. For vppon this returne of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> the Albanois hauing intelligence giuen him where he lay encamped, that the enemy did diſlodge, he put him ſelfe on<note place="margin">Scanderbeg purſueth the armie of the Turkes.</note> the way to purſue them with all his army, which was 8000. horſe, and 3000. foote, and liuely preſsing them in the rereward, without any intermiſsion, he held on ſtill killing and deſtroying them: and he gaue his ſouldiours good occaſion to fleſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and to ſhew the fury and eagerneſſe of their ſtomackes vpon all thoſe, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were found to ſlacke their pace, or by any miſchaunce and inconuenience were left behinde their companies: for there was none of them but were gleaned vp, and they did dearely buy it with the loſſe of their liues. The Barbarians did often make head againſt him with their whole army, to ſuſtaine and repulſe the violence of their purſuite. But the Albanois euer diſſembling as though he fled, did ſtill delude them, when they were ready to receiue him: ſometimes withdrawing him ſelfe into the next vallies and hilles adioyning, and then ſodainely againe appearing in ſight: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times would he charge them in front, ſometimes in ſlanke, and ſometimes in the rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: and thus ſtill skirmiſhing with them as they went on, he plagued them with a thouſand diſcommodities. In this maner mocking and abuſing <hi>Amurath</hi> and his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, he continued ſo long in purſuing them, that for ſixe miles together, he neuer left following them cloſe at the heeles, preſsing and annoying them with innumerable iniuries.</p>
            <p>The Emperour of the Turks being extreamly vexed with the ſhame &amp; ignominie<note place="margin">Amurath lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the Baſſa of Romania to repulſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaſion of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg.</note> of this abuſe, and at the ſlaughter of his people, commaunded the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Romania</hi> to ſtay behinde with 30000. horſe, for the ſurety and free retraite of the reſidue, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him that if the enemy did continue to importune him, he ſhould either charge

Wherefore he ſeized vpon certaine valleys and paſſages of the mountaines, where he knew he ſhould be ſafe, and that he could eaſily warrant both himſelfe and his army againſt the puiſſance of ſo many enemies. There for a while did he make a ſtand with his forces ready raunged in order of battell, as if he had bene vpon the point to go to charge vpon the enemy, and to hazard the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the field with the Mahometan: and peraduenture ſo would he haue done (ſuch was the hardineſſe and confidence of this perſonage,) if the wearineſſe of his ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, who were almoſt tyred with their long and hote purſuite of the enemy, and the inequalitie of their numbers being farre inferiour to the Turkiſh forces, had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained this braue warriour to lay apart that counſell which was ſo temerous and dangerous. Vpon this occaſion therfore addreſſing himſelfe to his ſouldiours, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming as if he would excuſe himſelfe, he ſpake vnto them this prouerbe (which he vſed <q>often:) I had rather (quoth he) that this place ſhould be noted to be famous for the<note place="margin">A prouerbe vſed by Sca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>When the Baſſa of <hi>Romania</hi> ſaw that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> would not moue, but did abide ſtill<note place="margin">The Baſſa of Romania mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth away af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Amurath.</note> within his campe he likewiſe by little &amp; little bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to remoue with his companies, &amp; to march away, being as willing to let alone the enemy and not to meddle with him, but to go onwardes &amp; to ioyne him ſelfe with the maine army that went before him.

Notwithſtanding the care and griefe of the Chriſtians was wonderfully comforted, in regard they were fully perſwaded, and made no doubt, that the infidels being once gone and departed, <hi>Sfetygrade</hi> might be ſoone regained, and without any great difficultie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered out of their hands.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> was of a humour cleane eſtraunged and alienated from any ſuch thought, and the haughtineſſe of his conceiptes did ayme at greater matters: and as one that was either vnmindfull or careleſſe of all other things, he fixed not his hope nor his thoughts vpon any thing, which did not ſeeme to exceede the common reach of all humane capacitie. Wherefore as the report goeth, at the firſt he did with many reaſons full of grauitie and ſententious, vehemently impugne this aduiſe and counſell<note place="margin">Aunſwere and ſpeeches of Sca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried life.</note> of his friends, exalting and commending with no friuolous proofes the ſimple &amp; <q>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maried life eſpecially in Princes and great perſonages. And he told them: that nothing was ſo burthen ſome and inſupportable to a free minde, as the dominion of a wife: that the troubles of mariage hauing once made an entry into a mans houſe, his body &amp; his ſpirite had no longer libertie to vſe thoſe rights which do belong vnto them: that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune<note place="margin">Mariage both trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and the hinderance of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s good fortune.

Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding at the laſt becauſe he would not ſeeme as one that was giuen to ouer much auſteritie,</q> not to neglect the good zeale and ſincere affection of his friends, he conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended and granted, being loath to refuſe their aduiſe in any thing which they ſhould iudge to be for the publique good, &amp; for the aduantage &amp; dignitie of the eſtate of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banie.</hi> And he was content to ſubmit him ſelfe to that yoake, ſince they thought it ſo expedient, &amp; ſeeing it was ſo agreeable vnto their minds. Neuertheleſſe he demanded a time of reſpit for the accompliſhment of the matter, and deſired that the ſame might <q>be deferred till ſuch time as <hi>Sfetygrade</hi> were recouered, ſaying: that for the preſent it could not but be greatly to his reproch, if he ſhould now bend his minde to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities of mariage, to feaſting and ſuch like actions of reuelling and banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: and in the meane while to ſuffer his allyes and friends to remaine vnder the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of the enemies of Chriſtianitie.</q> The Princes and nobles of <hi>Albanie</hi> thought them ſelues ſufficiently ſatisfied in that they had obtained thus much at his hands: and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:13368:103"/>
therefore they would not importune him any further, but yeelding him a thouſande thankes, as if he had done them ſome ſpeciall grace and fauour, or beſtowed ſome ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular gift vpon them: they quickly publiſhed &amp; made it known through al the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, &amp; the whole Prouince was repleniſhed with exceeding ioy at the report therof.</p>
            <p>Theſe things thus depending, there came meſſengers daily from the frontiers, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging tidings, ſometimes that the lands and poſſeſſions of the Barbarians were waſted and ſpoiled: and ſometimes that their ſcouts were beaten and put to flight. About the<note place="margin">Frontier wars betweene the Turkes in Sfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigrade and the garriſon of the Albanois.</note> ſame time alſo, the garriſon of Turks within <hi>Sfetigrade</hi> were enforced to keepe cloſe within their fortreſſe, by the daily and continuall skirmiſhes of our horſemen, who v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to ambuſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in the woods neere vnto the towne, did ſuffer none to eſcape whom they found at any time, wandering abroad either careleſly, or as they went on forraging, or vpon any other occaſion. For hauing many times iſſued foorth of the towne, they were enforced ſtill, moſt commonly, to returne againe faſter then with a good pace. True it is, that our Chriſtians doubting the diſaduantage of the place, durſt not go too neere the walles to encounter with them, but by feigned ſhewes of flight, they did ſtill endeuour to draw them out into the open fields. One day amongſt the reſt they grew ſo audatious, that 300 of them came forth and paſſed about a bow ſhot<note place="margin">A skirmiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the Turkes of Sfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigrade and the garriſon of the Albanois.</note> beyond the foot of the mountaine, drawen thereunto with a vehement deſire to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged vpon our men, with whom comming to the encounter with more fury then wiſedome, three and fortie of them there left their liues, and 14. were taken priſoners, the reſidue ſaued themſelues by their timely departure, flying away with a ſpeedy gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop: and there had not any one of them eſcaped to carry the newes into the towne, if their companions, who ſtaied within for the guard of the place, had not made haſt to come &amp; ſuccour them. It was an eaſie matter for the Scanderbegians in this tumult &amp; confuſion of all things to haue ſurpriſed the towne, if they had either chaſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with more feruencie, or if they had had a greater company. The Turks being from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth ſhut vp within their ports, were ſeized with ſuch feare and terror, that they durſt not any more ſet foot out of the citie, but held themſelues cloſe as if they had bene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged by a handfull of Chriſtians. All this was done onely by a part of that garriſon which (as we haue ſaid) was left vppon the frontiers. Notwithſtanding they did it without the aduiſe or knowledge of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> neither did he giue them any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion ſo to do: but ſent thither thoſe forces only for the ſuertie of his ſubiects, and to repreſſe the courſes and violence of the Painims. Neuertheleſſe being aduertiſed how all things had paſſed, though his ſouldiers in ſo doing might ſeeme in ſome ſort, both to haue contemned his authoritie, &amp; to neglect all order &amp; care of martiall diſcipline: yet was not this ſage &amp; prudent Prince any thing diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented with them, but he ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked both their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell &amp; their actions, that it both gaue him an occaſion to haſten his buſines, &amp; did incite him the more cheerefully to the aſſayling of the place, in regard that the feare &amp; reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of ſo ſmall a loſſe did make them to mew themſelues vp within their wals, as men quite diſcouraged and out of heart. For this cauſe without making any delay, before that he had proclaimed any generall muſter for the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of his old bands, or for any leauie of new ſouldiers: he diſpatched away to <hi>Sfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigrade</hi> 300. horſe, and 500. footmen, which he had then ready at hand to comfort &amp; aide their companions: to whom alſo he ſent many gifts and preſents, to ſhew that he approued thoſe exploits which they had already done, &amp; willing them to go on &amp; to perſeuer in the like, and whatſoeuer they could with ſafety enterpriſe againſt the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my they ſhould not neglect it, nor ſuffer them to take any reſt, till ſuch time as himſelfe comming with greater troups, &amp; with all other prouiſions fit &amp; neceſſary for a ſiege, might bring the town to be at his diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This done he bent all his thoughts to the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:13368:104"/>
gathering of new forces, ſo that within few daies he had aſſembled an armie of 18000 men, of which 8000. were horſemen, and the reſidue did ſerue on foote.</p>
            <p>His preparations being all ready, &amp; his cariages ſent away before, himſelf marched<note place="margin">Sfetigrade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged by Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg.</note> after with all his hoaſt: ſo that the xx. day of September, he planted his enſignes before the wals of <hi>Sfetigrade.</hi> His owne perſon &amp; his horſmen were lodged no farther from the wals, then ſo as an harguebuſſe ſhot could not reach them, (for the garriſon of the Turkes was in a manner all harguebuſſiers the beſt that <hi>Amurath</hi> could chooſe.) The footmen were quartered ſomewhat neerer: and to the intent the enemy ſhould not be able to offend them with their ſhot, they raiſed vp (in manner of a Palyſſado) a great quantity of rafters &amp; plankes, wherof he had made great prouiſion, behind the which the footmen might ſtand &amp; remaine in ſuertie. The Albanois were almoſt all of them archers: the reſidue being Italians and Almaines did ſerue with harguebuſſes &amp; croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowes. There were alſo ſome Sclauonians, who being more skilfull in the vſe of the<note place="margin">Souldiers of ſeuerall Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſerue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg.</note> ſword then of the bow: vpon the newes of this leauie of ſouldiers (being allured with the deſire of prey &amp; purchaſe) did come to ſerue with the Albanois voluntarily and without any pay at all. There were in thoſe daies that came daily into <hi>Epire</hi> out of all Nations to ſerue, &amp; to take pay vnder <hi>Scanderbeg:</hi> for that of all the Captains of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, he only was ſtill buſied and emploied, and was neuer out of armes: but in continuall ſeruice, as the mortall and deadly enemy of the Turkes and Miſcreants. For this cauſe many of them that were retained, being emiſed both with the ſweetneſſe of daily booties and pillage, and by the pleaſantneſſe of the countrie, did ſet vp their reſt to remaine and dwell there for euer. But the truth is that the moſt part being enriched with the ſpoiles of the Barbarians, &amp; growen wonderfull wealthy, did afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne home to their owne countries. There were alſo ſome Frenchmen to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 50. or more, who ſerued in that armie: they were appointed to haue the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging &amp; diſpoſing of certaine ſmall field pieces (for they were entertained ſpecially for Cannoniers) with the which they might annoy the defendants, rather then the ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers of the towne. For I do not find that there were brought thither any other grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter peeces, either for batterie or to make any breach, becauſe it ſeemed, that to force the citie by the ſcalado was moſt to the purpoſe. Theſe things thus ordained, the chiefeſt matter &amp; of moſt importance reſted yet behind: and that was, to prouide for the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilitie of the whole campe, &amp; for the more aſſured continuance of the ſiege: namely, to ſhut vp all the paſſages from the enemie: for by this meanes both the beſieged ſhold be out of all hope of comfort, and the Turkes ſhould be debarred from comming to ſuccour or relieue them. In this ſeruice was the old garriſon emploied, and there was ioyned vnto them a ſupply of 800. foot, &amp; 1000. horſe of the new leauied troupes. All which forces being deuided into two parts, the one moity of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſent with <hi>Streeſe,</hi> the other moitie with <hi>Tanuſee</hi> into diuerſe quarters, for the better gard of the reſidue of his bands, and to detaine all ſuccors from the beſieged. This was no ſooner conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on, but it was as ſoone put in execution. And thereupon <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> thought it high time to ſet his ſouldiers on worke, &amp; by giuing a braue aſſault vnto the towne, to let them know the fierceneſſe of his fury. For you muſt vnderſtand, that the ſeuen firſt dayes after the Chriſtians had preſented the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues before <hi>Sfetigrade,</hi> they were vnceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly occupied in encloſing &amp; entrenching of their campe, &amp; in building &amp; ordering of their lodgings (becauſe they thought they ſhould haue wintered before the towne.) And during all that time they had not in any ſort moleſted the beſieged, neither in word nor in deede: which made the ſouldiers now of all hands aſſemble about their Prince, demanding euery houre that they might be ſuffered to aſſaile the enemie. But <hi>Caſtriot</hi> being vnwilling to attempt any thing by armes, til he had firſt aſſaied al other
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:13368:104"/>
meanes, he did for a time reſtraine the forwardneſſe and heat of his men, till ſuch time as he had ſounded the minds of the defendants. He ſent therefore two ſouldiers to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vnto them the ſame capitulations, which the citizens of <hi>Sfetigrade</hi> did lately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of <hi>Ottoman.</hi> But the Turkes made no more reckoning of his offers, then as of a<note place="margin">Anſwere of the Turks within Sfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigrade to the ſummons of Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg.</note> thing of nought: but with notable reſolution, they ſent him this aunſwere, That the place which coſt them ſo much bloud, was not to be ſold for wordes: that he ſhould offer hardily the bodies of his people, yea his own head, for the price of the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that towne: and that then he ſhould well knowe, whether that their faith were dependant vpon the water of a well, as was that lately of the Dibrians.</p>
            <p>This aunſwere was no newes to <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> neither did it come contrarie to his expectation, for he foreſawe and coniectured how the Turkes were affected. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thought good to haue recourſe to the ſword, &amp; he determined to ſet the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians a worke as they had before deſired: and he tooke vnto him courage not as one that would vſe many words, but as an enemy that would make them feele the weight of his blowes. The next morning therefore about breake of day, hauing cauſed his<note place="margin">Suburbes of Sfetigrade aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted and burnt by Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg.</note> troups to approch cloſe vnder the wals, he firſt gaue the onſet vpon the ſuburbes, late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſigned by the Turkes to the poore citizens, which he cauſed to be ouerthrowen &amp; burnt. Many of thoſe, who inhabited in the ſame, at the firſt ſight of the Chriſtians enſignes, had their refuge to their ancient friends and allies: the others diſperſed here and there, and being retyred vnder the walles, did ſafegard themſelues by the fauour of the ſame, &amp; of the ſouldiers which ſtood aboue for their defence. In like maner the buildings next the towne were without hurt, except ſuch as the fire (being caried fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one to the other) did conſume with the like confuſion. The fury of the aſſaylauts did not in this place proceed any further, becauſe there were but few Turks there abiding, but only Sfetigradians &amp; Epirots, who although it might wel be ſuppoſed (as was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly to be ſeene) that they were but badly affectioned to our men, yet Chriſtian charitie made them to be more remiſſe and pitifull: and they meaſured the perſons by the habite and affections of their hearts in times paſt, and not by the eſtate preſent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> was not idle in the meane time, for perceiuing them of the towne to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied on that ſide in defence of the ſuburbes, and in quenching of the fire: he lead againſt<note place="margin">Aſſault by Moſes to the ports of Sfeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade.</note> the great gate three thouſande ſouldiers all ſtout men and hardie, whom being coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſhrowded with pauiſhes againſt the iniurie and force of the aſſaylantes, he did animate on with all his might to force and breake downe the portes. The Turkes (whoſe number was more then ſufficient both to defend ſo ſmall a place, and to yeeld readie ſupplies in all parts) came running thither ſpeedily from all quarters, and ſome of them from aloft with great ſtore of ſhot: others with great ſtones &amp; long peeces of timber, did prop vp &amp; defend the port on the inſide, making them ſtronger then they were before: by meanes whereof they cauſed our men to quit the worke which they had vndertake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And thus was the iſſue of that attempt without any great loſſe of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for the Chriſtians hauing not then (as it chaunced) brought any ſcaling ladders with them, they did not long ſtriue in aſſaulting of the walles, but they diſcharged their choller that day both on the one ſide &amp; the other, with bow ſhot and harguebuſſe ſhot only. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> hauing cauſed to ſound a retreat (albeit <hi>Moſes</hi> being chafed &amp; ſet in<note place="margin">Scanderbeg cauſeth to ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a retreat, and to giue ouer the aſſault.</note> a heate by litle and litle with the furie of that fight) did call and cry vnto his ſouldiers to bring their ladders and other engines for the aſſault: neuertheleſſe all of them vpon the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of their Generall did preſently retire, and in a maner againſt their wils, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ech man to his quarter. Thus were the courages of either partie at that time the more incenſed and ſharpened by the proofe of that ſmall &amp; light conflict, for that the fight was broken off without any hope or doubt either on the one ſide or the other.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:13368:105"/>
The reſidue of that day did <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> ſpend in diuerſe conſultations, deuiſing vpon<note place="margin">Conſultation of Scanderbeg for his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings againſt Sfetigrade.</note> the ſhort &amp; ſureſt way to force <hi>Sfetigrad.</hi> For the ſtrong ſituation therof which made it almoſt impregnable, and the great &amp; puiſſant garriſon wherwith it was ſtuffed, did euidently make ſhew, that the perill would not be ſmall, if they ſhould attempt it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderately or vnaduiſedly: and the late example of <hi>Amurath</hi> by his ouerhardy and too peremptorie experience, did coole the courages of the Chriſtians from being too forward in committing of themſelues to the hazard of the like inconuenience. It was concluded therefore for the more ſuretie, that during the daies following, the enemie ſhould be drawen forth by ſmall &amp; light inuaſions, and with as great ſubtiltie &amp; wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines as might poſſibly be inuented, he ſhould be entiſed to iſſue out, and to make ſome ſallies vpon them: hoping by that meanes in time, either to diminiſh the forces of the garriſon, without any great loſſe of their owne people, or elſe making ſhew by little and little of a diſſembled and fained flight, to toll the Infidels out from the guarde of their portes, and then ſuddenly at the ſame inſtant ſetting vpon them with great furie, they might happen to ſurpriſe the citie, during the tumult of that alarme and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if ſo be the Chriſtians did preſſe hard vpon the Turkes in their flight, and did ſtriue to enter with them pell mell, into the towne.</p>
            <p>The execution of this counſell was no longer delaied then till the next night, the darkenes and ſecrecie whereof did giue them the opportunitie to attempt it in ſuch manner as ſhall preſently be deliuered. <hi>Moſes</hi> was appointed to haue the leading of<note place="margin">Moſes.</note> 300. choſen horſe, to prouoke foorth the enemie. <hi>Zacharie Groppe</hi> on the one part<note place="margin">Zacharie Groppe.</note> with 500. horſe, and <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> himſelfe on the other part, with the like number of horſemen placed themſelues very cloſe and ſecretly in an ambuſcado. For theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, taking the benefit of the darkeneſſe of the night, and creeping with as great ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence<note place="margin">An ambuſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do laid for the Turkes of Sfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigrade.</note> and ſecrecie as they might, by the pendant of the mountaine, hid themſelues in a place verie fit and conuenient for an ambuſhment, and where the enemy would not haue any doubt thereof, euen amongſt the hollow &amp; winding turnings of the vallies, and amidſt the woods next adioyning full of buſhes &amp; bryers, where the ſcouts of the enemie could not haue any knowledge of their being. For hauing partly put out, and partly couering and keeping cloſe their fiers, they went forth on the backſide of their campe. The time it ſelfe alſo did in ſome ſort aide them to the concealing of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe: for all the long night, the ayre being full of moiſt &amp; foggie vapours, and the earth being couered with darkeneſſe, and with obſcure and thicke cloudes: the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall thunder and lightning did ſo hinder the ſight and hearing of euery man, that it was an eaſie matter to deceiue the Turkiſh Sentinels. The <hi>Dybrian</hi> in the meane time without ſtaying till the day breake, watched and pryed round about on euerie ſide with his men, in manner of a freebooter or robber: and approching by degrees neerer and neerer to the walles, he wandered vp and downe here &amp; there in the ſight of the townſemen, and did keepe ſtill within their daunger. They within <hi>Sfetygrade</hi> were not all of one minde and aduiſe, nor of like courage. Many would not be with<note place="margin">Speeches of the Turkes within Sfeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade, being deuided in their opinions, concerning a ſally to be made vpon the Albanois.</note> 
               <q>held, but did exclaime and crie out: That it was neceſſarie to iſſue out and to ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, and that it was a ſhame for them to endure and ſuffer, that ſo faire an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſhould be loſt: ſome others helde ſtiffely on the contrarie, That they ought to bouge nor attempt any thing without good aduiſe and deliberation. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon there grew a great alteration and diſſention amongſt them, as it is commonly ſeene in thoſe men, who being naturally of a fierce &amp; haſty diſpoſition are pricked on &amp; caried away by a kind of light incredulitie only regarding the outward ſhew &amp; ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial apparance of things, &amp; neuer looking nor ſearching into the marow, depth, and ſubſtance of matters. To ſuch men al good and wholſome counſels do ſeeme vile
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:13368:105"/>
and naught: and they do thinke that all good fortune is then only cleane fled &amp; eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> away out of their hands, if the ordering and diſpoſing of any affaires be neuer ſo litle deferred, or (as it were) ſeaſoned and attempred with a litle moderation of ſome ſhortand ſmall delay. Notwithſtanding in the end the better opinion (as the euent te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified) did beare it away, euen thoſe whoſe aduiſe was to be ſtill and not to ſtirre at all:</q> for they without could not heare any newes nor perceiue any likelihood of any ſalley; but the gates were kept cloſe ſhut, and none ſuffered to come forth, onely they were ſaluted with harguebuſh ſhot aloofe from the wals. The Albanois ſometimes in troups, and ſometimes ſcattered and diſperſed, with their bowes bent againſt them that ſtood vpon the wall, did courſe and gallop here and there, to the intent that they being prouoked the ſooner by theſe brauadoes, might be entiſed to iſſue foorth vnto them. But when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw that he got nothing but blowes, and that there was more likelihood of further danger, then of hope to doe any good vpon the enemie (for by this time two of his men were ſlaine, &amp; ſixe or ſeuen of them ſore hurt, that he could hardly carrie them away) he beganne to retire faire and eaſily from the wals: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing conceiued no leſſe indignation then ſhame, he withdrew himſelfe from the view of the enemie. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> likewiſe with his troupe in as pitifull a caſe as the other was not long behind him, but he came forth alſo from his denne extremely grieued and diſcontented: in ſuch ſort, that both he and his company, being thoroughly wet and (as it were) all dropping with the raine which had fallen on them all the night: and the <hi>Dibrian</hi> on the other ſide, returning with his ſouldiers full of anger &amp; deſpite, they gaue good occaſion to the enemy to laugh, and make themſelues merry at them.</p>
            <p>But the Epirot did not long endure this mockery, for he was minded to requit them with plaine and open force &amp; by a generall aſſault. The next day therefore, hauing ſet<note place="margin">Sfetygrade aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted by the Albanois.</note> his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies in order of battell, &amp; euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> appointed to his charge, about two houres before noone, he lead at the very firſt 10000. men againſt the wals. Of the reſidue of his army part was left to keepe the trenches, and part was reſerued in a teadineſſe for a freſh &amp; new ſupply, to the intent the aſſault ſhould not be interrupted. <hi>Moſes</hi> firſt of all<note place="margin">Moſes.</note> with a good ſquadron of ſtout &amp; valiant young men went to the ſcalado, hauing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued a good hope to carry the towne. For <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beneath with a great band of archers &amp; crosbowes Italians made the defendants by force of their ſhot to forſake their ſtandings, &amp; by that meanes the others had the more liberty to mount vp to the wals, in ſo much that many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hauing gotten to the tops of their ladders, did now get footing vpon the rampiers, &amp; there with equall courage &amp; fury did maintaine the fight with the Turkes for the poſſeſſion of the wals. The artillery, which as we haue ſaid, was pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted on the farther ſide of the town to beat the rampiers, did not ſuffer the garriſon to reſt on that ſide. For albeit the ſhot of theſe peeces did not make any great breach, yet did the wals daily decreaſe in the ſight of them that fought: &amp; the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants by litle &amp; litle did diminiſh &amp; waxe leſſe by reaſon that the continuance of the ſhot which raſed the wals, did alſo make away many of their me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſtood in defence of that place. If theſe here did performe the part of tall ſouldiers, I can aſſure you that the others did behaue themſelues with much more fury on that ſide, where <hi>Zacharie</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zachary Groppe.</note> 
               <hi>Groppe</hi> went to the aſſault, with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were the chiefeſt forces &amp; ſtrength of the armie, and eſpecially the Almaines who were reſolute euen to the death, and knew not what it was to recuile fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the enemy. Theſe with pickaxes &amp; bars of iron did ſeeke to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the wals where they had bin newly reedified &amp; repaired. Some couered with the targets of their companions and with baskets cloſe ioyned together, did digge &amp; vndermine the foundations: others voiding and ridding away the ſtones that were digged vp, did make the place like vnto an arch or hollow caue. The Infidels that
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:13368:106"/>
were aloft on the wall could not, although they would, hinder them from the purſuit of this worke. For albeit many of our men did droppe downe here and there, &amp; were ſlaine with harguebuſſe ſhot from the towers and flankers of the wall, yet did others continually ſucceede in their places without any reſpect of daunger, or without anie feare of death. And the others in the meane time with their croſſebowes and hargue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſſe ſhot did play vpon the enemie: and they had ſo diligent an eye vnto them wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they ſawe them to ſtirre or to preſent themſelues in the defence of the walles, that they kept them in ſuch awe and ſubiection, as without euident perill, they durſt not abide vpon the rampiers: yet the beſieged laughing at the great paines and labour that the Chriſtians tooke, did purpoſely delay and protract the fight. For in very deed the foundation of the wall was laid ſo thicke and ſo large by the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and beſides, it was rampiered within, with ſuch ſtore of ſtones and bankes of earth, that the place was ſure enough of it ſelfe, without the aide or ſuccours of any armed forces. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe for a while did <hi>Zachary</hi> hold on ſtiffely in his enterpriſe, to ſee if he could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile or find any entrie for his men. In the ende when he ſawe that he loſt his labour, and that it was almoſt an endleſſe worke, he chaunged his courſe: and to as litle pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he determined to ſcale the walles, crying vnto his ſouldiers, To the ſcalado, to the ſcalado. The Turkes perceiuing from aboue the new attempt of the Chriſtians, did purpoſely ſuffer ſome of them to mount euen to the toppe of their ladders, &amp; then ſaluting them with a great volley of harguebuſſe ſhot, and with great ſtones which they tumbled downe vpon them as thicke as hayle, they did eaſily turne both them and their ladders vpſide downe from the height of the wall to the bottome of the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley. For on that part the ground about the wall for a very litle way only was ſomwhat plaine and euen: but on a ſudden, it was inuironed with a mightie great downfall of a huge depth, exceeding hollow and ſteepe withall. Litle better entertainement had the aſſaylants on the other ſide, where <hi>Moſes</hi> with his company hauing reared their ladders, had diuerſe times raiſed vp the colours of the Albanois vpon the rampiers of the enemie: but the Pagans waxing raging mad to ſee this their brauerie and valure, cauſed a ſtrong ſupply of their companions to come thither, who held themſelues co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in a readineſſe to helpe and relieue their fellowes where moſt neede ſhould be. And then all of them cloſe ioyned together, beſtirring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues without all feare of death or daunger, did ouerthrow both men and ladders topſie turuy to the ground, killing and murthering many of them, ſo that in a ſmall ſpace they got the aduantage of the fight. And wheras they were but euen now as men confounded &amp; vanquiſhed, they wreſted the victorie out of the hands of the Chriſtians, with ſuch furie and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that the fortune of the fight being ſuddenly chaunged, and in an inſtant; it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that God did fauour their part. <hi>Caſtriot</hi> being wounded with extreame griefe to ſee his men ſo ill handled, and aboue all for the hurt of <hi>Moſes,</hi> whom with much<note place="margin">Moſes woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> adoe he had withdrawen from the ſhot of the enemie, and ſent vnto his tent to haue his wounds dreſſed: he was a litle retyred and gotten farther from the wall, where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing couered with the targets of two ſouldiers on ech ſide one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he inuited ſome to ſtand by him &amp; with their ſhot to play vpon the enemy. Others being freſh &amp; ſound, he commaunded and encouraged to take againe the ladders and fiercely to terrifie the beſieged by renuing of the aſſault. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> himſelf ſerued there that day with bow &amp; ſhafts, which many of them within the towne did find to their coſts. For it is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that it was a wonderfull thing to ſee how many Turks he alone did kill that day: and that he neuer drew any one ſhaft in vaine. It was no hard matter to bring the lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and to raiſe them againſt the walles, but the ſouldiers beganne now to preſent themſelues in ſlender troupes, and they durſt not hazarde themſelues in mounting
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:13368:106"/>
vp vpon the walles. One of them ſtood looking vpon another: and albeit the great<note place="margin">The Albanois repulſed from the aſſault.</note> promiſes of the Prince inuited many of them to be forward: yet did the recompence ſeeme to be deadly and mortall, as it made none of them deſirous to aduenture for it. Thus either partie growing into cold blood by litle and litle, they left fighting at the laſt, and the darkneſſe of the night which was equally deſired both of the beſt and worſt ſouldiers, did end and determine that daies ſeruice. The Albanois held them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues quiet and verie ſtill within their campe all that night, as thoſe whom both the ignominie of the day before and their preſent miſfortune did ſeeme to inuite to take their reſt with ſilence: for they had loſt two hundreth of their beſt ſouldiers, and of thoſe that were wounded there were aboue ſix hundreth, of whom there died of their wounds ſhortly after more then thirtie. Of the defendants, though there were a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number ſlaine, and that the cries and plaints of an infinite number, which were wounded were heard on all parts: yet the repulſe of their enemies, and the preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the place, made them to demeane themſelues in great mirth till the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: paſſing away the night with great fiers, and they neuer ceaſed running vp and downe the walles and rampiers, ſinging of ſongs, and making great triumph and exceeding ioy.</p>
            <p>By this time had <hi>Ottoman</hi> intelligence of the ſiege of <hi>Sfetigrade,</hi> and it grieued him<note place="margin">Amurath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimeth a new leauie of forces to returne into Epire.</note> at the hart, often times complaining that when he was ſcarce gotten to one end of his trauels, and had but newly licenſed his armie to depart, he ſhould now againe be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to a worſe warre then euer, eſpecially in the beginning of winter: a ſeaſon not ſo ſtrange as vnfit and inconuenient to make warres in. Neuertheleſſe ſeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vanquiſhed both with ſhame and with a certaine kind of neceſſitie and predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate fortune, which would not permit him without ignominie and diſhonor to leaue his townes to the oppreſſion and furie of his enemie, he concluded againe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiue his former preparations, and to proclaime a new muſter: and to this effect he diſpatched on all parts his Saniacks, Baſſaes and Chieftaines, employing all meanes which he could poſſibly deuiſe to haſten his purpoſed iorney. And the firſt thing that he did, was, to publiſh abroad his returne into <hi>Epire,</hi> perhaps doing it of purpoſe to giue the more countenance and authoritie to the matter: or for that the Chriſtians being aſtoniſhed vpon the report of this newes, might be diſcouraged from procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with their ſiege. For to ſpeake the truth what I thinke thereof: hardly can I be perſwaded, that there is any likelihood or probabilitie, that the <hi>Sultan</hi> in the laſt point and period (as it were) of his age, and the daies being at ſhorteſt, in ſo intemperate a ſeaſon and time of the yeare, would be ſo fooliſh and vnaduiſed as to take the fielde at that time in proper perſon; conſidering eſpecially, that the matter was not of ſuch importance, that (if any accident ſhould haue happened) it could haue bene any great preiudice vnto his crowne or kingdome: but that ſome other rather then himſelfe might haue bene ſent, and employed in that action, and haue diſcharged it well and ſufficiently for his honor and reputation.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Epyre</hi> being nothing at all abaſhed for the late ſlaughter of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or through the diſfauor of fotrune for that daies ſeruice, did apply all his wittes, and emploied his beſt diligence, from time to time to moleſt and annoy them of the garriſon: ſomtimes in the day, and otherwhiles in the night, he would lead his troups cloſe vnder the walles, and caſting balles and pots of wild fire vp into the aire, which fell downe amongeſt the enemies: he ſought by theſe and all other meanes to aſtoniſh them: and ſometime he would ſend forth ſome ſmall number of ſouldiers, to gather together the dead bodies, and to drag them away, thinking by that policie to haue drawen them foorth to iſſue out vpon them. All theſe attemptes and cunning deuiſes
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:13368:107"/>
being practiſed in vaine by the Albanois, he concluded to make an end of this ſiege, after he had once more by one other aſſault tried the laſt and vttermoſt of his fortune, howſoeuer the ſame ſucceeded and fell out: and he was induced to this reſolution, partly by reaſon of the hurt of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and partly alſo becauſe the ill ſucceſſe of the laſt<note place="margin">Scanderbeg encourageth his ſouldiers to a new aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault.</note> aſſault might ſeeme in ſome ſort to be excuſed and imputed to the ſudden comming of the night vpon them, which might alſo promiſe the hope of better fortune to ſuch as had their mindes charged with care, and did interpret things according to their owne particular affections. Wherfore the day following after the ſun riſing, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it to be proclaimed throughout his campe by ſound of trumpet; that beſides the great rewards promiſed in recompence of their vertue who ſhould enter firſt, he did permit them to haue the pillage of the towne, and he amplified the matter with many good words, making it ſeeme a great thing in ſhew and beyond all credit. Beſides, he ſeemed to deplore and bewaile the ſhame &amp; ignominie of the name of the Albanois: that ſo many excellent Captaines and braue ſouldiers, after innumerable proofes of their ſufficiencie and valure, ſhould to their ſingular reproch be enforced by a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of baſe and vile ſlaues to make ſo long abode, and ſo ſhamefully to ſpend their time vnder theſe walles which were ſo ſhamefully loſt vnto the enemie. And he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of them, how long they would ſuffer and endure this infamie: that within their owne prouince, and in the middeſt of ſo many townes and fortreſſes, and nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their obeiſance, one vile garriſon of the Barbarians who had nothing but bare walles to defend them, and were deſtitute of all other hope and comfort, ſhould keepe and holde out ſo long in this place, euen vnder their noſes, and ſhould in a manner triumph at their puſillanimitie and want of courage? That they ſhould hardly do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny exployt of worth in a ſtrange countrie and a farre off in forraigne regions, if they had not the power to diſlodge and driue away theſe robbers who were gotten (as it were) within their doores, and did dwell euen within their very bowels.</p>
            <p>With theſe and ſuch like diſcourſes and examinations hauing ſet a newe edge on the courage of the Albanians, and made them more eger againſt the Infidels, he deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded<note place="margin">Second aſſault to Sfetigrade.</note> his companies, and hauing left about 600. for the guard &amp; cuſtody of the campe, with the reſt he preſſed the towne on all ſides where it was approchable. At the firſt they began the fight with their ſhot only both on the one ſide and the other, ech man doing his beſt to draw bloud from his enemie. After they had ſufficiently skirmiſhed together in that manner, and that they beganne now to growe in choller: the moſt hardie and ſuch as were well chafed betooke themſelues to their ladders, being min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to talke with the enemy ſomewhat neerer. Once or twice were they couragiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repulſed by the defendants, and they gaue them not ſo much leaſure, as to raiſe their ladders to the walles: but at the laſt the Barbarians being ſurmounted by the hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and obſtinacie of the Chriſtians, who no otherwiſe then as Lions almoſt fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, doe ruſh vpon the flocke without any remembrance either of ſnares or other trappes that men doe vſe to lay for them: ſo they, furiouſly perſiſting in the aſſault without all feare of death or daunger, by little and little, did yeelde and giue place to ſo extreame furie: and wanting both ſtrength and weapons to keepe off the enemie, they retyred themſelues behinde the rampiers in ſuch ſort, that they gaue the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans<note place="margin">The Albanoys winning the walles of Sfeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade vpon a ſurmiſe and feare of ſecret ambuſhments forſake and looſe the towne.</note> good meanes and opportunitie to haue made themſelues maſters of the place. But ſee what feare of Ambuſhments may doe: our men who till then were ſo fierce and couragious, and who in a cruell and bloudie aſſault, ſhewed themſelues ſo prodigall of their liues, and ſo careleſſe of death it ſelfe which they had continually euen before their eyes: aſſoone as they perceiued the enemie to waxe faint, and that one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other did abandon the wall, they beganne preſently to miſtruſt ſome policie, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:13368:107"/>
a conceipt and imagination, that ſome great troups of the enemie did lye cloſe behind the rampiers in ſome ambuſcado, and did attend there to bid them to ſome ill banquet: they grew more cold and negligent in their actions, and caſting their eyes about them on ech ſide, and carefully regarding all places neare them, they did expect nothing elſe, but euen in a moment to be all of them deſtroied: ſuch was their vaine and fooliſh opinion. Herewithall had the Barbarians good leiſure to bethinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and to prouide for that which ſhould be needfull and neceſſary: and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions flocking thither from diuerſe quarters vpon the rumour of that fraie, and bringing with them great ſtore and quantitie of weapons, did reuiue both their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and their good fortune. In this concourſe many a man loſt his life, both on the one ſide and the other: but many more on the part of the aſſailants then of the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants: and more had bene ſlaine if the readineſſe and good deuoire of <hi>Zachary</hi> had not hindred them: for he at another part of the wall hauing raiſed vp many ladders, did interrupt this their victorie, diuerting the enemie by a new onſet: ſo that they were conſtrained to ſeparate themſelues, and to ſunder their forces. All this while you might haue ſeene <hi>Caſtriot</hi> with his ſquadrons, ſometimes approching neare the wall, to terrifie them within: and ſometimes doing the dutie of a ſimple ſouldier, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them the way againſt their enemies; one while by prayers, another while by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches he would ſolicite and animate them on. The archers and other ſhotte being placed round about the walles, did keepe their ſtand where they were firſt appointed, and ſtill as the furie of the fight encreaſed and continued, they did neuer ceaſe to play vpon the Infidels as they marched vp and downe vpon the curtins. When the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants did perceiue that their numbers did decreaſe, and that the Chriſtians did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in courage and obſtinacie farre beyond humaine reaſon: they doubted what would become of it, and they feared the iſſue of that daies iorney: wherefore to ſtop the courſe of their furie, and to gaine time to themſelues, they deuiſed this policie. They ſnatched vp the Turkiſh enſignes from the rampiers, and calling to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans<note place="margin">A policy of the Turkes within Sfetigrade</note> with a loud voice, they deſired a truce and ſuſpenſion of armes for a litle ſpace, and that they might haue libertie to parley with <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi> This was granted vnto them by the Albanians with the conſent of their Generall: and both parts being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſurceaſe from hoſtilitie, the Infidels were permitted to ſpeake their minds. Thereupon one of them, an auncient and graue olde man (after he had firſt yeelded<note place="margin">Speech of a Turk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

At the firſt <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> ſhewed himſelfe highly diſcontented and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing tractable to thoſe demaunds of the Mahomatiſtes,</q> iudging verie wiſely, that they ſought for nothing elſe, but fraudulently by theſe ſhifts to deferre the aſſault for that day: and either to depriue him of that aduantage whereat he had them: or elſe in

True it is that he ſaw, that if there were any good hope to force the place, that this ſmall time of delay could not depriue him of that aduantage: wherefore retyring his enſignes, and engines of aſſault, and his troups being withdrawen into the campe. The reſt of that day, and the night following was ſpent in great reſt and quietnes.</p>
            <p>The next morning, foure Turkes, men notably ſubtile and wily, being deputed to treat vpon this matter, came to ſpeake with the Prince of <hi>Albanie;</hi> and brought him diuerſe exquiſite gifts and preſents. The conditions whereupon they offered to capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate were of that nature and ſubſtance, that not onely any victor, but euen men van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed would haue bene loth to accept of them: and they did it purpoſely to prolong the time, that whileſt theſe ſhould be reiected, in ſtead of them they might preferre others, and after that againe others: by meanes whereof, the treatie might be drawen at length. And this was the ſumme of their demaund, That the ancient citizens being<note place="margin">Conditions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the Turkes of Sfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigrade.</note> reſtored within the towne with their old priuiledges and immunities, both the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and the fieldes ſhould be equally deuided amongſt them all: and that in this <q>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they reſigning and yet retaining ſtill the towne, would become his ſubiects, and yeeld vnto him perpetuall fidelitie and obeiſance, vtterly diſclaiming the name and gouernment of <hi>Ottoman.</hi>
               </q> And they required alſo, tenne thouſand aſpres in readie mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to be giuen to their Gouernor. The Chriſtians gaue them no anſwer, but onely laughing at theſe demaunds, through pure deſpite which they conceiued of the ſame, they cryed preſently on all parts, To armes. And thus with iniuries and ſcoffes were theſe deceiptfull meſſengers diſmiſſed together with their guilfull and fallacious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents. The Paynims left not for all that, but ſuddenly ſent againe the ſame perſons to attend and know the laſt reſolution of the Chriſtian Generall, and in caſe they could not otherwiſe diſpatch, to referre the whole to his diſcretion. This ſtrange alteration in the mindes of the enemie, and their ſuſpected liberalitie, though it did keepe <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi> from beleeuing them ouer raſhly; yet neuertheleſſe he thought it not good to <q>reiect theſe meanes altogether: wherefore he tolde them plainely, that he would not<note place="margin">Anſwere of Scanderbeg to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            </p>
            <p>Whileſt the Barbarians did in this manner come and goe to and fro, and that they did thus faine and diſſemble, three whole daies were ſpent and conſumed in theſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parlances, and at length the ende made manifeſt, what was their intent and purpoſe. On the one ſide therfore the ſubtiltie and inuention of the defendants was diſcouered:
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:13368:108"/>
on the other ſide newes being now come of the ſtirring and ſpeedie comming of the great Turke, it did greatly grieue and perplexe the minde of the Prince of <hi>Albanie.</hi> To quit the place beſieged, the late iniurie and abuſe proffered by the Turkes would not permit him: and to continue there, he ſawe that both the doubt of the enemie, (who was reported to be neare at hand behind his backe) and the importance of all his affaires, which were of greateſt conſequence did diſſwade him from it: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he remained there a while longer, till ſuch time as there came more certaine aduertiſements of the preparation made by <hi>Amurath.</hi> But it ſeemed, the very deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies did oppoſe themſelues againſt his deſires. For the heauens powred foorth ſuch maruellous abundance of moiſtures and ſhowers in all that time, that the ſouldiers could not ſet their feete without their trenches, much leſſe could they attempt any thing againſt the walles. The raine being ceaſed, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> proclaimed one aſſault more againſt the towne to be giuen the day following: and he gaue good order and direction, that all things requiſite ſhould be made and prouided in a readineſſe. Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe abſtained from ſleepe all the whole night: ſometimes being buſied and emploied in diuerſe matters, which were moſt needfull and materiall: &amp; ſomtimes did he walk<note place="margin">Scanderbeg encourageth his ſouldiers to a new aſſault.</note> vp and downe his campe here and there, encouraging and exhorting his people: often times telling them, that they muſt either driue the enemie cleane out of <hi>Epire,</hi> or not returne any more to the campe, till they had made themſelues maiſters of the towne: <q>that the realme of <hi>Epire</hi> did ſeeme diſguiſed &amp; deformed: that nothing could be ſaid or eſteemed in ſafetie and ſecuritie, if the Pagans ſhould be ſuffered any longer to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide and continue within the countrey. And admit that there were no perill or daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be feared, nor any diſhonor did enſue by ſuffering them, yet what reaſon had they to endure thoſe outrages of their enemies? and how long would they ſwallow vp thoſe deriſions, and diſgratious ſcoffes and abuſes which had bene offered them?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the night being quickely ſpent in theſe conſultations and prouiſions for the intended ſeruice, the day began now to approch, before the breake whereof <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi> drawing foorth his troups, did lodge them all againſt the walles: but the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers found it more painefull to creepe vp againſt the hill, then was ordinarie or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed:<note place="margin">Third aſſaul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to Sfetigrade.</note> and the way was more ſoft and ſlipperie vnder their feete, by reaſon of the great ſtore of water wherewith the earth was waſhed: that it made them to drawe their ladders and other engines with great paine, and (as a man may ſay) to dragge them with their teeth. Neuertheleſſe the Chriſtians, being lately incenſed with chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and inflamed with anger, did not feele either the difficultie or the painefulneſſe of their attempt. The beſieged who doubted of no ſuch matter, at the firſt did reſort to the defence of the walles in ſmall numbers, and were ſomewhat negligent in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoire: but hauing quickely made prouiſion of all things, they haſtened thither with greater forces, and reenforcing their defence, they were of ſufficient power to repulſe the aſſailants. From thenceforth the audacitie and forwardneſſe of the Epirotes was not ſo fierce and violent as before: and the ſwords and countenance of the enemie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now neare them and at hand, did inuite and perſwade them to carie themſelues aduiſedly, and with diſcretion: and not with furie and raſhneſſe, and too much har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe of courage. Wherefore caſting a carefull eye to the blowes of the enemie on the one ſide, which fought with them aloft from the walles, they tooke a conceit im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, that there was another enemie at their backes: and that the rumor (which had bene reported of the returne of <hi>Amuarth</hi>) was not in vaine, nor a tale falſely giuen out. The bruite of this concepit did ſo encreaſe from mouth to mouth, and it tooke ſuch force in their credulous hearts, by a certaine apprehenſion of vaine feare that they ſeemed to ſee before their eyes thoſe preparations of the enemie, which were yet
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:13368:109"/>
ſcarcely begun: and they imagined the <hi>Sultan</hi> to be alreadie come into <hi>Epire,</hi> who was yet quiet and at reſt at home in <hi>Andrinople. Scanderbeg</hi> though he were of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible courage, yet perceiuing this feare and terror of his ſouldiers, was conſtrained to yeeld to the preſent neceſſity: and by reaſon that all things were in a kind of horror, confuſion and diſorder: he cauſed to ſound a retrait, and to ſurceaſe from the aſſault.</p>
            <p>It was ſcant the ninth houre of the day, but that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> (after his men had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken<note place="margin">Siege of Sfeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The trees and other frutes in the country had not bene exempted from the wrath and fury of the common ſouldiour, but they had made ſpoile and hauocke of all, if the Prince of <hi>Albanie</hi> had not repreſſed their rage: telling them, that it was to be hoped one day when it ſhould pleaſe God to be more fauorable vnto them, to recouer the towne, and to reeſtabliſh the ſame in her former eſtate. And therefore without any ſignes or markes of an enemie left behind him, he diſlodged as ſecretly as he could, and tooke the direct way towards <hi>Croie.</hi> It is reported that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> loſt at this ſiege of <hi>Sfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigrade</hi>

A thing moſt abſurd and far from all reaſon, conſidering the great number of the Turkes which were ſlaine at the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer expedition, when they beſieged the ſame place: as all men do confeſſe iointlie and with one accord: vnleſſe perhappes we will ſeeme to ſay as the fabulous Poets haue imagined of ſome men: that the bodies of the Chriſtians were leſſe penetrable then thoſe of the infidels.</p>
            <p>It was on the three and twentieth day of October that (the ſiege of <hi>Sfetigrade</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Scanderbeg prouideth for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the defence of Croy and other places.</note> raiſed) <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> with his armie returned to <hi>Croie,</hi> where he had ſcant a minute of leaſure to recreate and to refreſh himſelfe, but that he gaue preſent and ſpeedie order for the enrolling of men, and made choiſe of Captaines and leaders, to whom he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed their ſeuerall charges according as the conſequence of his affaires, and the newes lately brought vnto him did require.

And beſides all this, he had behaued him ſelfe well and valiantly during his whole life. Both the goodly repreſentation of his perſon, and the grauitie of his yeares did make him to be reuerenced of all men: and the auncient Nobilitie of his race, did greatly beautifie and (as it were) ſeaſon all theſe good parts in him. Wherefore to confirme and continue this good opinion concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of him by the Albanois with ſo generall a conſent and liking, he promiſed to

make no ſpare of his paines nor vigilancy, though it were with the loſſe of his life in all occaſions where it was needfull to be emploied. To <hi>Stelluſa</hi> likewiſe and <hi>Petralba,</hi> and other places of ſtrength, were ſent both gouernors and ſufficient forces to defend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Neither was it forgotten to appoint a great multitude of perſons in all the towns, who ſhould make prouiſion of victuals &amp; munitions from all parts. But notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all the care, paines, and induſtry taken in that behalfe, yet hardly could they make prouiſion of the ſame for 3. whole moneths, by reaſon both of the continuall ſpoile and waſt made by the wars, and for their daily attendance and emploiment in armes, which had cauſed the Epirots that year before to neglect their husbandry, &amp; not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to tillage. Notwithſtanding the report is, that certaine marchaunts of <hi>Venice,</hi> and others of the inhabitants there in the Venetian territories, did furniſh them of victuals ſecretly and vnder hand: becauſe at that time (ſuch was the ill hap of the Chriſtians) the lords of that Signiory were in league and amity with the Turkiſh Monarke.

For my part I will not wrong that Senat, which hath euer bene reputed both ſage &amp; religious, to ſuſpect that they did it in any other reſpect and conſideration, but only for the good and preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Greece,</hi> which ſeemed then to be banded and deuided euen within and againſt it ſelfe. And therefore I leaue this matter for others to giue their iudgements vpon it.</p>
            <p>Prouiſion being made of graine and other victuals within <hi>Croy,</hi> the common gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and magazins were filled in ſuch rate and proportion, as it was ſufficient to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine the ſoldiers for one whole yeare. Then was there preparation alſo made for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of all kinds of ſhot, both long bows and artillery: the charge &amp; managing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was continued to the French-men, &amp; they had allowance at all times both in peace and war, for each mans pay 5. crownes a moneth. And moſt part of the garriſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Croy</hi> were harguebuſsiers &amp; croſſe bowes. The affairs of <hi>Croy</hi> being well ſetled and aſſured, that which remained of the victuals, did <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> cauſe to be tranſported and deuided to other townes and places of the Prouince. For his owne part, before he would leauy any new forces to be retained to himſelfe for the moleſting and inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the enemy, as he was accuſtomed, he thought it good firſt to go and viſit thoſe troupes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he had lately ordained for the defence and guard of the frontiers. And therefore he called vnto him <hi>Moſes</hi> and ſome few horſemen beſides, with whom hee went both to take order, and giue directions for all things, and to ſend forth eſpials to ſound out the enterpriſes of <hi>Amurath,</hi> that he might be fully enformed of all things in particular.

And at other times would he diſguiſe himſelfe, and in the habit of a ſheepherd, would go euen vnder<note place="margin">Scanderbeg diſguiſeth him ſelfe to eſpie aduantages v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his enemies</note> the walles of <hi>Sfetigrade,</hi> to eſpy if he could by any policy or ſtratageme (as he had in times paſt) or by force, or by fauor of ſecret trains and ambuſhmens cloſely laied, ſeize vpon that towne, and get it out of the hands of the <hi>Ottoman.</hi> By meanes whereof, they

            <p>During that time that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> was thus carefully buſied about his affairs, the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pials<note place="margin">Amurath vpon the newes of the ſiege raiſed at Sfetigrade re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth his iourney into Epire.</note> being returned brought him tidings, that there was no more talke of aſſembling any forces by the <hi>Sultan,</hi> but that the fury of his armes was deferred, and that <hi>Amurath</hi> had put off the war of <hi>Epire</hi> til the next ſpring: for he hauing heard of the departure of the chriſtians from the ſiege of <hi>Sfetygrade,</hi> needed not to be entreated (conſidering the ſeaſon of the yeare) to make ſtay of his preparations, which he had begun with ſo great heate and vehemency, but changing his former order &amp; decree, he had cauſed a new e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict to be publiſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That al his ſoldiers and captains who were appointed &amp; enrolled for that action of <hi>Epire,</hi> ſhould make their repair and <hi>rende vous</hi> at <hi>Andrinople</hi> the 15. day of March following. He had a great deſire to haue that voyage &amp; the ſiege of <hi>Croy</hi> to be concealed and kept cloſe: but he could not diſguiſe nor conuay his matters ſo cunningly, but that euery man might aſſure himſelfe that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> was the enemie againſt whom thoſe forces ſhould be emploied. Vpon this determination of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſhe Monarch, the Chriſtians likewiſe had leiſure for a while to breath themſelues. Wherefore the garriſon vpon the frontiers being diminiſhed by the one moity, there were not left aboue 2000. at the moſt, who building for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues lodgings &amp; cabins (as the faſhion is of ſouldiers) did prouide againſt the iniury of the weather, &amp; winter ſeaſon, and the reſidue of them were diſmiſſed &amp; had leaue to depart home.

This done, as he was euer ſtirring &amp; impatient of reſt, ſodainly he ſet foot in ſtirrop, poſting to this and to that place: and being meanly apparelled, and with 10. men only in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, he went to the Potentates his next neighbors and allies, and to the gouernors of the <hi>Venetian</hi> towns, labouring to embarke them in this war, and to put them in mind of the imminent danger and ruine, that did threaten them euen at hand, and did hang ouer their heades: both admoniſhing and encouraging them to the remembrance of their deuoire and duty. Neuertheles the moſt part of that winter, he paſſed couertly in the confines of <hi>Macedony,</hi> in company of the garriſon which was there appointed. All which time, a man ſhould ſcarce haue ſeene them of <hi>Sfetygrade,</hi> to iſſue forth out of their gates, for that the neareneſſe of our campe being but 15. miles off, made them to ſtand carefully vpon their guard, and did keepe them in great feare and awe.</p>
            <p>The cold winter being thus ſpent and paſſed ouer, with the new ſpring came new<note place="margin">1450.</note> labours and calamities, and all things grew more troubleſome both in publicke and in particular.

            <p>The Prince of the Turkes in this meane while, had at the time prefixed, aſſembled the moſt part of his forces, &amp; yet he wanted many thouſands to furniſh vp ſo huge and<note place="margin">Amurath lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uieth his army and maketh preparations for his iourney into Epire.</note> maſſy an army as that which he had the yeare laſt paſt. By reaſon, that either the far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of places, or the difficulty of the waies did hinder ſome of them, either more or leſſe. And therfore attending till ſuch time as he ſaw his numbers and preparations in all points performed, becauſe he would looſe no time, he emploied that ſpace in the prouiſion of other things neceſſary for an action of that weight and importance, and eſpecially for the gathering of victuals. Albeit order had bin taken, that euery ſouldier ſhould furniſh him ſelf in particular with victuals for many daies prouiſion: for he was fully reſolued, that the Chriſtians had not left any corn vpon the ground, and that they would waſt and deſtroy all the paſture and herbage vppon the firſt tidings of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. It were almoſt a thing impoſsible to number vp all the inſtrumentes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines of aſſault which were prepared. Amongſt the reſt, there were many tooles and inſtruments of iron vſed by husbandmen, beſides an infinit number of bars and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks, &amp; pickaxes made of iron crooked of purpoſe to dig in mines, as was afterwards ſeene by experience: for the <hi>Sultan</hi> had bin perſwaded to vſe this deuiſe as a moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious and fit meane to carry the city of <hi>Croy,</hi> which otherwiſe was inexpugnable.

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:13368:112"/>
ought it to ſeeme ſtrange vnto any man. For by reaſon of the great burthen of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of the army, and the infinite baggage of the ſouldiers, &amp; partly for the eaſe and pleaſure of their ſoueraigne, being now very aged and deep ſtricken in years, they did not march aboue 5. miles a day. Thus you haue <hi>Amurath</hi> now before <hi>Croy,</hi> you may imagine that you ſee his companies lying diſperſed all ouer the fieldes, aud the towne enuironed and girt in on all ſides, ſo that there was no ſpace, no not a foote of ground round about the walles but it was couered with lodgings and pauilions; inſomuch<note place="margin">Croyans their notable and aſſured cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</note> that many of them were quartered more then 6. miles off: neither was it poſſible that ſo exceſsiue a multitude ſhould otherwiſe be lodged in any ſort to their caſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity. The wonderfull ſight of this ſpectacle was ſufficient to haue abaſhed the cora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the moſt braue &amp; hardy, not only of the ſouldiers, but euen of the captains and leaders, and to haue abated the ſtomacke of euery man not without ſome reaſon and cauſe of feare and terror, by the contemplation of their owne proper perilles, which might haue made them forgetful &amp; vnreſpectiue of their religion, of their country, of their faith and fidelity, and of all bonds of duty and common honeſty. Neuertheleſſe, ſuch was the corage of the beſieged far aboue the ordinary vſe of men, that they were nothing altered from their firſt purpoſe and reſolution, neither could the obiect of ſo pompous and fearefull a ſhew in any ſort terrrifie them, but rather taking thereby an occaſion of greater hardines and conſtancy, for the maintenaunce of their liberty and reputation, which they had before apprehended in their generous aud noble hearts; they did meaſure the greatnes of their glory, and did imagine that the quality of their future triumph and honor ſhould be recompenced according to the hugenes &amp; extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the perill then imminent. Wherfore, you might haue ſeene the ſouldiers ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon the wals, as gallant and reſolute as was poſsible, euery man with a certaine kind of iealoſie enquiring &amp; entermedling with the charge and duty of others, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare &amp; make all things ready againſt the time that the aſſault ſhould be preſented: and in the night time by their fires which they kindled, by their clamors and ſhouts inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled with ſongs and ſuch like ſignes of mirth and gladnes: they gaue forth euident notice &amp; teſtimony what litle account and reckoning they made of the enemy.

               </gap>aſtels of <hi>Epire,</hi> had now forgotten their wonted feare and aſtoniſhment, and they imagined that neither the power nor the name of <hi>Ottoman</hi> was of ſo great force and puiſſance, nor ſo much to be redoubted as in times paſt when he came againſt them. For they were now ſo hardened and acquainted with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of ſo many euils that the continuaunce and cuſtome of perilles, had brought them to contemne and ſet at naught all dangers whatſoeuer.</p>
            <p>The Infidels ſpent 4. whole daies in tranſlating and fitting of their lodgings, which being once ordered according to their liking, they came flocking in great troupes to the tents of their Emperor, demanding &amp; requeſting that they might be emploid. But for that day their deſire was refuſed, &amp; they commanded with a moſt ſeuere charge to keepe themſelues ſtill within their campe: the cauſe hereof was the extraordinary reſt of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> which did beyond all meaſure augment the ſuſpition of the old <hi>Sultan,</hi>

And concerning the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of <hi>Croy,</hi> in caſe his religion did not like them, he was content to graunt them free

With theſe conditions the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds being arriued neare vnto the Port, (for there was but one only by reaſon that on all the other parts of the city, the mountaine runneth whole continually on without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny breach, and is not to be approached) the Gouernor who had word ſent him of their comming by them of the court of guard, came riding thither very well accompanied: of whom the Heraulds requeſted that they might be admitted to ſpeak with him, and to deliuer that which they had in charge, but he wold not permit them to enter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the town, but only to approach ſo neare as their voice might be well &amp; conuenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard and diſcerned: and therupon made a ſigne vnto them that they ſhould ſpeake their minds. It is a ſtrange thing and very wonderful to ſee the fidelity &amp; reſolution of the <hi>Croians.</hi> Scarce had the Turks any time or ſpace to make an end of their ſpeach, but<note place="margin">Meſſengers of the Turke reiected by the garriſon of Croy.</note> that the ſouldiers interrupting the anſwere of the Gouernour, who was beginning li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally and ſtoutly to ſpeak his mind, did generally exclaime &amp; cry out: <q>that the enemy was to be anſwered with harguebuſſe ſhot and not with words; adding thereunto (as the guiſe of ſouldiers is) many ſcoffes and iniurious tearmes againſt the meſſengers.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This being rehearſed &amp; made knowen to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> his wrath &amp; indignation was<note place="margin">Amurath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth for the aſſaulting of Croy.

This worke was long a doing &amp; endured aboue 15. dayes. Of ten peeces which were made &amp; fully finiſhed, there was ſome difference in their greatneſſe: yet foure of them were of like<note place="margin">The batterie pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted againſt Croy.</note> equall bigneſſe: &amp; each of them did carry a ſhot of 600. weight, and the other which were leſſer bare a ſhot of 200. weight. Foure of the leſſer peeces, &amp; two of the greateſt were planted againſt the wall on that ſide that lyeth to <hi>Tyranna</hi> toward the Eaſt: the others were placed right againſt the Port. For on thoſe parts onely had they hope to enter the towne by meanes of ſome breach made in the wals, becauſe the acceſſe was more eaſie in thoſe places, in reſpect that the wals &amp; fortifications there were raiſed &amp; builded by handywork of men. And albeit they ſeemed to be moſt ſtrong &amp; ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, yet did they not doubt but the fury of the canon would at length leuel them with the ground. As for all the other bulwarkes and fortifications, they were euery where aſſured with ſuch excellent ſtrength, &amp; the naturall ſite of the mountain did ſo ſerue in ſtead of a rampier, that there needed not any workmanſhip of man to defend them: for if the moſt hardy and aduenturous men liuing durſt enterpriſe againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they ſhould but loſe their labor for any hurt they could do vnto them: in ſomuch that it is thought that the wall wherewith the towne is enuironned vpon the top of the mountaine, was raiſed there of old by the founders of the city, not for any defence or ſtrength that it could adde vnto the place, but only to giue a better grace, and to beautifie the towne.</p>

The towne was greatly endammaged both on the one part &amp; the other: the rampiers were beaten down, &amp; almoſt halfe the wall was ouerthrowen &amp; razed, and the reſt ſo ſhaken &amp; torne that it ſeemed ready to fall with the leaſt violence that ſhould be vſed againſt it. The Turks ſeeing ſo faire &amp; wide a breach, were in a ſingular good hope to carry the towne: and therefore they ſhewed<note place="margin">Turkes make preparations for the aſſault of Croy.</note> themſelues very forward to prouide ſcaling ladders and other engins ready for the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault. It was a wonder to ſee how the ſouldiers beſtirred themſelues, labouring &amp; ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to get together from all parts great and mighty beames of timber, &amp; running vp
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:13368:113"/>
&amp; downe the fields to make prouiſion of all other ſorts of engins and deuiſes. There was not almoſt any tent but with a kind of emulation did bring forth ſome particular ſtuffe or matter to ſet forward the aſſault: and according as euery one of them had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to out go ech other, &amp; to beare away the reward that was propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded for him, that could firſt free the wall againſt the enemy. The Baſſaes themſelues and other the chiefe officers of the grand Seignior did not make any ſpare of their paines nor did they ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<note place="margin">Mahomet his induſtrie at the ſiege of Croy.</note> idle, ſo deſirous they were to preuent the good grace &amp; fauour of <hi>Amurath. Mahomet</hi> was noted aboue the reſt to vſe an vnceſſable kind of diligence, and with a ſingular vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacitie of ſpirit, as if he had bene one of the meaneſt ſouldiers, was alwayes about his father, and ſetting aſide all regard of his eſtate &amp; degree, he ſpared no trauell &amp; paines but did buſie &amp; employ him ſelfe in all matters with great readineſſe &amp; reſolution: and running ſometimes here, ſomtimes there, he did enflame and encourage the ſouldiers, as much by the example of his owne doings as by words and chearefull exhortations. And morethen that, it is reported, that beſides the reward publiquely propounded by the <hi>Sultan,</hi> he promiſed a 100000. aſpres to him that ſhould firſt get within the town, and ſhould faſten the Turkiſh colours vpon the wall.</p>

Contrariwiſe the Chriſtians had their minds fixed vpon this: that all maner of moſt ample &amp; honorable rewards were aſſuredly to be expected fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> &amp; they did conſider moreouer that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeruation of the realme, the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of their countrey, the ſecuritie of their confederats, &amp; in briefe the welfare of all the eſtate of <hi>Albany</hi> did conſiſt &amp; depend vpon their valour &amp; vertue. For this cauſe they were animated &amp; hartned not onely with a kind of obſtinate &amp; ſettled reſolution and with a purpoſe of incredible perſeuerance: but they were tranſported with ſo violent a paſsion of wrath and furie, that they ſeemed as men almoſt enraged. Whereupon though the wall being throwen downe and ruinated on that ſide, did giue them cauſe both of griefe and terrour by the deformitie of that obiect: yet did the greatneſſe of their coutages neuertheleſſe ſo preuaile in their reſolute and ſtout harts, that it did eaſily put away and expell out of their mindes all conceipt of faintneſſe, feare or ſorow: &amp; they did mutually recomfort &amp; encourage ech other.

extreme heat of the ſummer: neuertheleſſe the <hi>Ottoman</hi> thought it to be the beſt time, becauſe he miſtruſted, that if he ſhould haue drawen them out of the campe either in the night, or late towardes the euening, perhaps it would haue giuen <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> the more oportunity to ruſh vpon them and to inuade and moleſt his trenches, and yet did not this his ſuſpition gaine him any thing, neither was it altogether in vaine.</p>
            <p>The allarme being giuen, and the troupes (as we haue ſayd) being iſſued forth, and<note place="margin">Scanderbeg in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uadeth the campe of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murath before Croy.</note> marching on with a wonderfull noiſe and ſound of trumpets drummes, and clamours of the ſouldiers, they were now come to the wals: and the foremoſt of them had ſcant or but newly begun the fight, when the Turkiſh campe was ſodainely in an vproare, and was filled with a great tumult and horrible feare ſprong vp amongeſt them. The cauſe thereof was <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> who hauing of a long time watched and layd eſpiall to ſee what the <hi>Sultan</hi> would determine to doe: now with a ſtrong troupe of horſemen (the moſt able and beſt mounted of all his army) was come to the tents of the enemy, &amp; ruſhed in vpon them where they lay next and nigheſt vnto him. The Turks which were placed there in that quarter, did receiue him at the firſt onſet very reſolutely: but perceiuing by the loſſe &amp; ſlaughter of many of their fellowes, that they could not hold out nor ſtand againſt him: they being ſcattered &amp; diſperſed here &amp; there in that feare, had ſoone forſaken both their court of garde and all things elſe whatſoeuer, if the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who were next them had not made haſt: and running thither from all partes at the noyſe of the allarme, &amp; making head againſt the enemy, had not ſtayed them from flying farther. The Albanians keeping their ranckes cloſe, and taking the aduantage of this good fortune, did charge thoſe that came laſt to encounter them more liuely then<note place="margin">Number of Turkes ſlaine by Scanderbeg at his firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaſion of their campe before Croy.</note> they had done the former, and hauing layd more then 600 Turkes dead at their feete, and made the Barbarians on that ſide to betake them ſelues to flight, they ſacked two of their tents carrying away diuerſe enſignes, and whatſoeuer elſe was found within the ſame. This rumour being brought from hand to hand (as the maner is) to the eares of <hi>Amurath,</hi> who was then buſied in ordering his forces to the aſſault, although the old man had made prouiſion before of many things, &amp; did greatly affie himſelfe in the ſufficiency of thoſe whom he had left within the campe: neuertheleſſe dreaming and <q>forethinking himſelf of the worſt that might happen (for he was wont euer to ſay, that<note place="margin">Saying of Amurath touching Scanderbeg.

               <hi>Mahomet</hi> who did alwayes burne in extreame hatred againſt this Prince (though his father would haue diſwaded him from it) went thither alſo being accompanied with the ordinary garde of his perſon, but before that theſe forces were ready on foot, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> perceiuing that he ſhould not be able to make his partie good againſt ſo many (as were comming vppon him) had turned bridle and prouided for the ſuretie<note place="margin">Scanderbeg in great hazard of his life.</note> of him ſelfe and his people, yet not without the extreame daunger of his life. For (as the report goeth) the heat of fight had made him ſo farre to forget him ſelfe, that he brake in amongeſt his enemies where they were thickeſt, and he engaged him ſelfe ſo farre, that he was almoſt oppreſſed by them, and he was not able (but with extreame payne) to make him ſelfe way through the multitude that preſſed vppon him and ſought to ſtoppe his paſſage, for both his owne ſtrength, and the forces of his horſe began to fayle, in ſomuch that very hardly and difficultlie did he eſcape and free him ſelfe from amongeſt them. And after he was with much a do gotten from them, yet did they not ceaſe on all parts to purſue him as long as they had any hope to ouertake him, or to ſtaye him. In this manner did the Chriſtian troupes on the one ſide, and the Generall on the other ſide by a happie retrait ſhift them ſelues out of the fight of the <hi>Mahometiſtes.</hi> This tumult being pacified and appeaſed, the Turkes retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:13368:114"/>
vnto their camp, and the <hi>Sultan</hi> his ſon repaired to his father, extreamly grieuing<note place="margin">Mahomet voweth and ſweareth the deſtruction of Scanderbeg.</note> that after ſuch a brauado &amp; the ſlaughter of ſo many of their people, his enemy ſhould be eſcaped from him. And he there tooke a ſolemne oth before them all, that he would neuer leaue watching whole moneths, daies, and nights (if need were) but at one time or other by his ambuſhments and traines, he would get this ſauage and wilde beaſt to fal into his ſnares which he meant to lay for him: that he wanted neither a good mind nor good meanes to effect it: and he did ſo far aſſure himſelfe of a good ſucceſſe, that if the other did hold on ſtil, and continue in this brauery &amp; temerity, thus to aſſaile them and to approach to their trenches, he did not doubt but to make him to repent it.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Epire</hi> hauing freed him ſelfe from the purſuite of his enemies, tooke an other way, and went after his owne company: who being in a maruellous care and<note place="margin">Scanderbeg his abſence cauſe of great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie to his ſouldiours.</note> perplexity for the abſence of their maſter, went here and there wandring vp &amp; down, and ſending forth ſouldiours in queſt on all parts to ſearch if they could diſcouer him, or could heare any newes of him in any place. Many of them alſo could not forbeare teares lamenting and deploring the eſtate of <hi>Albany,</hi> which ſhould remaine as a tender orphan, and the common weale of <hi>Epire</hi> which ſhould continue deſolate (as it were) in widowhood by the death of ſo diuine a perſonage ſo barbarouſly murthered by the Circumcized miſcrea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. But his ſafe returne (whereof they deſpaired) did reuiue their harts, &amp; made them ioyfull both in priuate and publike: in ſo much, that beſides diuers ſongs vttered by the common ſort in token of their gladneſſe: many of them with great deuotion performed their vowes which they had made for his ſafety: being in a firme beliefe, that by the ſame they had obtained of God, both his life and the recouery of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany. His ſhield was ſo battered &amp; cut with the ſwords of his enemies, that the ſhape therof was ſcant to be diſcerned: &amp; yet was not his body in any ſort hurt or wounded.</p>
            <p>The rareneſſe of this accident is ſo maruellous, that the truth thereof may ſeeme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible: notwithſtanding for my part I can eaſily be drawen to beleeue it. For admit that there were not in this Prince any corporall force, or dexterity in armes extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, more then in the common ſort of men: yet without all doubt, fortune (or to ſpeake more properly,) the diuine power and puiſſance can do greater things then this, and farre more ſtraunge without all compariſon. But it may be that an other matter may make this more doubtfull, and that is, that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> in all his actes, and exploits at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieued in times paſt, was neuer knowen to haue committed ſuch an ouerſight &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruity, where he had any time or leiſure to take any counſell or aduiſe vppon his actions. But perhaps it is requiſit, that we ſhould grant and attribute vnto ſome men of a hardy and magnanimious ſpirit, as the Poets do: that ſometimes in the wars they are tranſported, with a certaine fury and martiall impetuoſity, ſo as being once chafed and enflamed, they cannot for a while after, neither moderat nor refraine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues at their owne pleaſure. For before a man draw his ſword and take weapon in hand, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth well what he doth, and he is guided by reaſon which doth direct him. But when theſword is once drawen, then only doth fury and choller guid him, &amp; he doth as the vehemency of his paſsion doth lead him. Such was that notable and renowned hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of <hi>Horatius Cocles</hi> amongſt the Romaines, by which he ſuſtained the force of the<note place="margin">Horatius Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles his ſtrange prowes againſt Porſena.

            </p>
            <p>But to our purpoſe, the dammage that our men receaued in this conflict was not great: for there were ſlaine not aboue ten, and as many wounded, (for the Prince of <hi>Albanie</hi> hauing left behinde him all his infantery, and thoſe horſemen who were
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:13368:115"/>
worſt mounted) had inuaded the infidels with 5000. horſe, all of them choſen men, ſtout, &amp; valiant: who being prompt &amp; ready either to fly or to fight, might eaſily ſhun the force &amp; violence of the enemy. Wherefore hauing wounded their generall, they proceeded ioyfully on their way and ſo returned to their campe. But neither this fayre<note place="margin">Scanderbeg penſiue for feare of Croy.</note> victory gotten vpon the enemy, nor any other occaſion whatſoeuer of mirth or glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe could ſuffice to cheare the hart of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> or to make him mery: his thoughts were mightely troubled and ſurcharged, with the wonderfull &amp; deep conceipts of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite miſchiefs, &amp; he could not be quiet till he had ſome newes of the ſucceſſe of <hi>Croy.</hi> For notwithſtanding that the fidelitie &amp; approued valure both of the gouernour and of the garriſon, and the inexpugnable ſituation, and the good eſtate of the place did much comfort and eaſe his minde of care: yet neuertheleſſe on the one ſide, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the perill, and on the other ſide the incomprehenſible loue of his countrey, did enforce him euen in deſpight of his hart, to be affrayed: and a carefull kinde of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt did preſent vnto his imagination, many idle and vayne diſcourſes.</p>
            <p>Concerning <hi>Amurath,</hi> albeit the former allarme had not made him altogether to diſcontinue the aſſault: yet the chiefeſt preparations, &amp; the beſt endeuours of the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour were for a while hindered and reſtrained, till ſuch time as he had perfect notice what was the iſſue &amp; end of that ſeruice, which being made knowen vnto him to that effect as we haue deliuered, he cauſed forth with euen thoſe that were moſt backward and negligent, &amp; all his engins &amp; inſtruments for the aſſault to be bent &amp; employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the beſieged. Firſt of all he cauſed the archers &amp; other ſhot to ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d round about,<note place="margin">Aſſault to Croy.</note> ſo as they might annoy them which came vpon the wals to defend them. The leſſer peeces alſo were planted ſo neare, as they might well play vpon the defendants, whileſt in the meane time the raſcall ſort of the moſt vile &amp; commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſort of people (who were ordained of purpoſe to ſuſtain &amp; beare out the firſt fury of the enemy) ſhould draw &amp; cary the ladders &amp; other engins cloſe vp to the wals. And after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were to follow cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine braue and luſty troups of the <hi>Ianiſſaries</hi> &amp; <hi>Aſappes:</hi> who vpon the raiſing of the<note place="margin">Ianiſſaries. Aſappes.</note> ladders were appointed to the ſcalado, and ſo to get to the top of the breach: that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to fight hand to hand with the defendants, they might the ſooner terrifie them and gayne the towne more eaſily. This was the maner of the aſſault on that part where the wals were weakeſt, &amp; where the cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had made the battery: as for the other parts there was little or no care to be taken of them: for though the whole circuit of the wall had bene ouerthrowen &amp; razed: yet was it almoſt impoſsible, that the ſouldier could attempt any way on that ſide to endammage them by reaſon of the huge height &amp; rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſteepneſſe of the mountaine. Yet were there certaine peeces placed there alſo, and they played with great ordinance vpon that part of the towne, both to giue the more terrour to the Croians and to beat downe certaine priuate houſes, which ſeemed to be ſubiect to the force of their ſhot. Whileſt the Turkes were making their approches to the town, the defendants diſcharged certaine volleys of ſhot vpon them, &amp; did ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their rancks with the ſlaughter of many of their people, that it might haue terrified them from approching any nearer if the leaders of euery ſquadron (following them cloſe at their backes, &amp; ſolliciting them ſometimes with good wordes &amp; perſuaſions, &amp; ſometimes with menaces &amp; threats entermingled with the baſtinado) had not preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to go forward with their violent and rough vſage: and more then that, this their obſtinacie ſeemed to be the greater, becauſe the Mahometans with thoſe peeces which they had placed there of purpoſe, did without intermiſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> annoy them that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared vpon the rampiers, &amp; ſought to beat them from their defence: whileſt the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanzes (a number of ſlaues charged with ladders &amp; ſuch like preparations) did gayne<note place="margin">Alchanzes.</note> the foote of the wall, the which their labour tooke ſuch good ſucceſſe that at length
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:13368:115"/>
their ladders were lodged againſt the wall, notwithſtanding all the reſiſtance that the Chriſtians could make againſt them: and yet was it not effected without great ſlaughter and bloudſhed of the Infidels. Then beganne the defendantes euery man in his place and charge, to ſettle themſelues more roundly to their labour and to vrge the enemie more hotely: they made no ſpare of their ſhot both harguebuſſe and other, and now beganne their hatred more apparantly to be diſcouered. The clamours of the ſouldiours, the noyſe and clattering of their armour, did reſound on all ſides, the ſound of the drummes and trumpets continually redoubling in the ayre, and rebounding by the eccho and report of the vallyes neere adioyning, did the more animate and encourage the ſouldiers, taking away all power and poſſibilitie of hearing from them that were in fight. But as the cauſe and occaſion of their armes was different, ſo was there as great difference in the conflict: there was little likelihood for them to carrie the place from the beginning, if ſome other caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or miſchaunce of warre did not befall the aſſaylantes. The ladders were often rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt the walles, and the place was forced with manhoode ſufficient, but they were aſſoone caſt to the ground, broken and torne in peeces: the men alſo tumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling headlong that were mounted vppon them. The remainders of that huge mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the baſer and common ſort, were ſo broken and diſmayed, that they could not be made to continue there anie longer, by reaſon that both their ſpirites were ſurpriſed with an extreame feare, and their limmes (as it were) benummed with a kinde of aſtoniſhment. Scarcely ſhould you haue ſeene any one of them that was forward or willing to haue gone againe to the aſſault, though it did little auaile them to holde backewarde: for <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſtanding at their backes, both as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſeer of their demeanour, and as a ſeuere encourager (which perhappes was part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a cauſe that got him the name and report to be accounted a moſt cruell Prince by all poſteritie) did entreate them very roughly, and would not ſuffer them nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to recuile backewarde, nor ſo much as once for to breath them ſelues. Thus poore wretches, whileſt they thought to ſhunne and auoide the rage and fury of their aduerſarie, they were more cruelly plagued by the exceſſiue rigour of their owne Commaunders.</p>
            <p>Theſe miſerable and poore people thus handeled by the Infidels, are (for the<note place="margin">Chriſtians ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects of the great Turks their miſerable eſtate and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous condition</note> moſt part) Chriſtians vnder the ſubiection of the great Turke: of whome it is an ordinarie vſe and cuſtome with him to drawe foorth a wonderfull great trayne and multitude in all his expeditions almoſt wholly naked and diſarmed, becauſe he hath no truſt nor affiance in them. With theſe doth he furniſh and ſupply all the ſeruices of his campe, both for the prouiſion of the water and wood, and for the making and caſting vppe of their trenches, rampiers, and other fortifications: and when they come to fight (if it be in the fielde or in the maine battell, then are they<note place="margin">A ſtratageme vſuall with the Turks to weary and conſume the ſtrength of the Chriſtians in fight.</note> firſt expoſed and ſet out to the butcherie, to beare the force and violence of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, that they may diminiſh and ſpende their ſtrength and forces vpon theſe poore and ſilly wretches. If anie fortreſſe or place of ſtrength be to be aſſaulted, theſe are made as carriage beaſtes to drawe the artillerie, to carrie the engines and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to the walles: and their bodies are made to ſerue them but as fitte mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to fill vppe the ditches, and their carkaſſes are vſed but as bridges for others to paſſe and trauell on when they goe to the aſſault. And when ſo euer they doe happen to march on ſlowly or vnwillingly, they doe finde more crueltie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanitie at the handes of the Turkes their Lordes and Maiſters, then they doe of their proper and profeſſed enemies. Certainely it is the deadly hatred and naturall enmitie which they beare againſt the name and profeſſion of Chriſtianitie,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:13368:116"/>
that doth cauſe them to vſe this moſt beaſtly and ſauage crueltie, and not anie want<note place="margin">Siege of Scuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie or Scodra by the Turkes.</note> of other meanes that ſhould conſtraine them thereunto. At the laſt vnfortunate ſiege of <hi>Scutarie,</hi> many of theſe and ſuch like cruelties were then practiſed by the Turkiſh Infidels.

That though their bodies were compelled to march and to carrie armes againſt them, yet their hearts and good willes were moſt deuote and affectionate vnto them, as thoſe that did acknowledge one and the ſame God, the ſame faith, the ſame religion: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that they were not vnder the ſame Princes, that this was to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the publique fault and negligence of the Chriſtians, and to their owne priuate misfortune and vnhappie deſtinie.</q> Vpon theſe their complaintes and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, the citizens of <hi>Scutarie</hi> to the vttermoſt of their power did ſpare and fauour them, though in very truth, their eſtate then ſtanding as it did, they could not verie eaſily take that compaſſion of them which they gladly would haue done. O moſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable and extreame griefe, my heart is ſurcharged with ſorrowe, and my ſoule doth euen faint within me to thinke vpon the miſerable and diſtreſſed eſtate of theſe poore Chriſtians.

            <p>
               <q>Good God, is it poſſible that the great Princes and Monarches of Chriſtendome<note place="margin">An exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the author vpon the miſerable eſtate of the Chriſtians vnder the Turkes.</note> can ſo long endure both to heare and to ſee this extreame miſerie?

And are Chriſtian Princes ſo hard and ſtonie hearted, that none of them will commiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat thoſe extremities? The bloud of Chriſtians doth nowe flowe (as it were) in ſtreames throughout all partes of the worlde: and our ſtrength fadeth and decayeth by little and little, and no man the whileſt doth or will perceiue it. We are now fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into thoſe times (ſuch is the diuine pleaſure, or rather, ſuch is our ingratitude and infidelitie) that the bloud ſanctified by Chriſtian baptiſme, is now more vile and baſe then the bloud of brute beaſtes: and it will ere long come to paſſe (if this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe be ſuffered to encreaſe, and to gather greater ſtrength) that the circumciſed, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vs to ſale, ſhall ſcarce be able to make a pennie of thirtie Chriſtians, but they will be bought and ſolde at a more baſe and vile price, then were the Iewes of olde time, who (as auncient * Hiſtoriographers make mention) at the deſtruction of<note place="margin">Ioſephus.

They were Launceknights and Epyrots mingled together, who ſeruing with the harguebuſſe, had with great difficultie, gotten leaue of the Gouernour to iſſue forth of the towne, but they went not farre from the wall, where hauing made a reaſonable ſlaughter of the enemie according to the proportion of their ſmall number, they retyred themſelues imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly with a greater deſire to returne againe.

But farre greater was the ſlaughter on that quarter which was towardes <hi>Tyranna,</hi> where the breach being more plaine and ſpatious, did giue more free acceſſe to the aſſaylantes. All places there were ſtrawed and filled with dead bodies: and the earth did ſeeme to mourne with the pitifull noyſe of the panting ſighes, gaſpes, and groanes of thoſe, who yeelded vp their wretched ghoaſtes. And notwithſtanding, they neuer wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted encouragementes to enforce them on in their obſtinacie: but the miſerable wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were preſſed and vrged in a moſt deſperare manner, by the careleſſe contempt of their owne liues, to make a ſhewe vnto the Chriſtians of more courage then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede was in them. The rampiers and walles of the towne were ſo full ſtrewed both with ſhotte, and alſo with other ſtore of weapons, that it argued they made no ſpare of them: and the arrowes did flie ſo thicke in the ayre, as if it had beene a cloude darkening the brightneſſe and cleareneſſe of the ſunne. Thus you ſee what was the endeuours of thoſe Turkiſh ſquadrons, which went firſt to the aſſault.</p>
            <p>The day was now well ſpent, and it was aboue two houres after noone, at which time the <hi>Sultan</hi> ſeeing his troupes partly lying dead vppon the ground, and partly wearied with their great and long trauell: and on the contrarie ſide, the Croyans preſenting themſelues more brauely vppon the walles, he was at the firſt in ſome doubt and ſuſpence, whether it were better for him to renew the aſſault with a ſupply of freſh forces, or to intermit and put it ouer to another day, conſidering that both the great labour of his people taken all that day, and the exceſſiue heate, had ſo weakened the bodies of his ſouldiers, that they were ſcant able to endure to ſtande for faintneſſe and wearineſſe. <q>In the ende therefore hee was perſwaded<note place="margin">Speeches of the Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors of Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to recontinue and renue the aſſault of Croy.</note> to continue and goe forwarde with the aſſault by the importunities of his Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and Chiefetaines, who ſhewed him, that if hee ſhould nowe giue ouer the fight, and ſhould ſuffer the Chriſtians with ſo ſmall loſſe and bloudſhed to haue the aduantage of that dayes victorie, it would be an eternall reproach and infamie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. And albeit they ſhould haue little or no hope to carrie the Towne, yet he ought not in reſpect of his owne honour to ſuffer ſo many braue and valiant men their fellowes and companions to die vnreuenged, nor yet to reſtraine the forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and willing minds of the others. That all ſecondarie aſſaies were more faint and contemptible, and that they were nowe better acquainted with the enemie, and were more hardened to all kinde of daungers and trauels. B ſides that, if he ſhould
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:13368:117"/>
now giue them libertie to take breath, they would haue leaſure alſo to reſolue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with the more confidence, &amp; to fortifie their town with ſtronger defences: that it was much better therefore with freſh and new forces to attempt againſt the place, &amp; to force them to the vttermoſt whileſt they were yet wearied and ſore trauelled with their late labour: that when the defendants ſhould ſee them thus obſtinately bent and couragiouſly reſolued, either they would of themſelues abandon their defences, or they muſt needes faint and periſh vnder the burden of ſo vnſupportable a charge.</q> 
               <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murath</hi> vpon theſe perſwaſions followed their aduiſe, and cauſed as great forces as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be lead and conducted againſt the walles: in ſo much that the tumult began to be renued in a moment, and it might be that fortune her ſelfe forſaking the victours, would haue fauoured the new attempt of the Mahometiſtes, if the defendants had not<note place="margin">The aſſault renued.</note> with as great diligence and foreſight prouided in like caſe to receiue them in as good ſort and readineſſe, which was the occaſion that freſh men being oppoſed againſt freſh men, they did without any great paine hold good both in the poſſeſſion of the place, and in the maintenance of their honour and reputation. The Barbarians went ſtill onwards at brute and ſenſeleſſe beaſts, eſpecially on that ſide that leadeth towards the port, and although the way by which they ſhould paſſe was ſo ſtreight and narrow, that two horſemen could hardly march in front together: yet notwithſtanding they went on all on horſe backe euen cloſe to the walles, and with their launces in the reſt did runne againſt the gate, giuing thereby greater occaſion rather to laugh at their fooliſh and ſottiſh careleſneſſe and contempt of their liues, then to admire or to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend any hardineſſe or courage that appeared in them. Wherefore there lay ſo many of them ſlaine on all parts, &amp; there were ſuch heapes of dead carkaſes, as it might well be ſaid of <hi>Vranocontes,</hi> that he forepropheſied what would be the end and iſſue of that aſſault. The Turkiſh Monarch being not able to endure this hideous ſpectacle, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſound a retreat, which freed both the walles and the defendantes from further trouble of the enemie: and there was not any one but had forgotten the former paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his malice and hatred, and had loſt that feruencie and deſire of fight wherewith he was lately poſſeſſed. So greatly did they of all hands deſire to leaue fighting, &amp; this ſtay of the aſſault was welcome to them all. For their continuall labour and the heat of the day, accompanied with extreame hunger and thirſt, had in a manner wholly ſpent them, by reaſon that the ſuddenneſſe of the aſſault had preuented many from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any repaſt. The reſidue therefore of the day and the night following, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in refreſhing themſelues both with ſleepe and victuals.</p>
            <p>The ſame night tidings being brought to <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> of the victory of the Croians, it gaue him good cauſe of ioy and gladneſſe: and he preſently imparted theſe good newes vnto the Princes and peoples his next neighbours. But on the other ſide, the<note place="margin">Number of Turkes ſlaine at the firſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault of Croy.</note> enemie was in great ſorrow and diſcontentment, and was ſeene for many dayes to be very ſad and penſiue, for the notable loſſe of that daies worke was very hard to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, hauing loſt in that ſeruice more then 8000. good ſouldiers: but the Croians had verie little loſſe, and without any great ſlaughter to ſpeake of. It is reported, that <hi>Amurath</hi> kept himſelfe cloſe ſhut vp within his tent for two whole dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in debating vpon diuerſe counſels and opinions with his Captaines, and the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirs his Counſellers. But aboue all others, young <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſhewed himſelfe to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably vexed and diſcontented: his ſpirit boiling with fury and choller, and his youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full yeares being yet vnacquainted with croſſe fortunes and aduerſities, had turned all his paſſions of griefe and anguiſh into meere rage and madneſſe. From thenceforth he tooke vpon him to deale in all the affaires of the campe, &amp; with a carefull eye viewing and reuiewing all the ſeuerall companies, he ſhewed himſelfe ſo greedie of reuenge,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:13368:117"/>
that he ſpared not to labour himſelfe extreamely both night and day, and was verie watchfull at all times to take the aduantage of any fit occaſion: but principally he had an eie to that ſide where the Albanois had lately endammaged their campe. For there he placed a ſtrong and puiſſant court of garde, and dreſſed many ambuſhments, and oftentimes would he watch there him ſelfe whole nightes in proper perſon, to the intent if fortune did preſent him any good opportunitie to oppreſſe <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> he might not eſcape againe out of his handes. But all theſe his deuiſes turned to nothing, and vaniſhed away as the ſmoake by the prouident and circumſpect cariage of that expert Chiefetaine the Prince of <hi>Albany,</hi> who being from day to day enformed of all thinges, either by ſuch as came to render themſelues vnto him, or by eſpials ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad of purpoſe, he helde himſelfe ſtill and quiet in his campe for a ſeaſon, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and prouiding for the ſafetie of his affaires, and drawing on his enemies with delayes.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding he could not endure to remaine long idle, but being very deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous that his enterpriſes ſhold ſurpaſſe all others in glory &amp; reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he aduiſed him ſelf of a fine ſtratageme, by which he purpoſed to ſurpriſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who were too intentiue to intrap him. One night therefore truſſing vp his baggage, very ſecretly, he remoued<note place="margin">Monticlea.</note> his army to a place called <hi>Monticlea,</hi> from whence he might moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modiouſly trauel &amp; diſturbe the enemy.

According to this concluſion there was little diſtance of time betweene the allarme made by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the comming of <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi> For aſſoone as he perceiued the ſudden rumour and terrour of the allarme raiſed by the<note place="margin">A canuazado by Scanderbeg to the campe of the Turkes.</note> Dibrian on the other ſide, he bare in with a full and ſtrong carrer, and charged them on that part where they litle doubted or ſuſpected. In this manner was the campe of the Infidels full of doubt, feare, and confuſion: ſome ranne here, ſome there, making great haſte on all ſides, to oppoſe themſelues againſt the violence of the Chriſtians. One of them wakened another, crying that they were enuironned and rounde beſet with the enemie. But as for <hi>Moſes</hi> he did indeede put them in a feare, and that was all he did, by reaſon that thoſe ſouldiers which had beene lately placed in that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> did eaſilie repulſe them, eſpecially ſuch as were moſt forward. But the night hindered them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> purſuing after him, for that they ſuſpected ſome ambuſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they had good cauſe to be in doubt of, and eſpecially at that time. But the dammage that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> wrought them cannot be recounted. For their campe was on all parts beaten downe, and foully deformed and diſordered both by ſword &amp; fire, and yet did not this inuaſion continue any long time, by reaſon of the ſudden com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and readie arriuall of the Turkes, whoſe preſence in ſo great multitudes did ſoone determine and ende the conflict. For the Chriſtians making a retreate, durſt not hazarde and oppoſe themſelues againſt ſo huge forces as were there vnited, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in a place that was ſo plaine and euen: for it was in <hi>Tyranna</hi> where they gaue this charge vppon the enemie. Neuertheleſſe when the Chriſtians beganne to retire, the Infidels had no great deſire to follow after: and if they had, it might be they ſhould
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:13368:118"/>
haue paid well for it: for this warie and circumſpect warrior had placed all his infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie and 8000. horſe neere at hand, to the intent they ſhould be as a gard vnto him behind at his backe, and ſhould ſerue againſt all ſuch caſualties as might befall him. Of theſe companies was he receiued in his retreate with great ioy and high cries and clamors: and ſo paſſing forward, they ſpent the reſt of the night in trauelling to their campe. It is reported that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> did neuer doe anie exploite vppon his enemie with leſſe loſſe and bloudſhed: for he brought backe all his troupes ſafe and ſounde without the loſſe of any one man, not leauing vnto the Barbarians aniething ſaue woundes, teares, and lamentations, as the teſtimonies of his being with them; in ſuch ſort, that this ſlaughter and foule diſcomfiture, did make them in a manner quite to forget the calamitie of their late loſſe which they had had before <hi>Croy.</hi> No man durſt from thencefoorth open his mouth vnto the <hi>Sultan,</hi> or to aduiſe him to any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe: for this accident hauing ſucceeded to their ſo notable infamie, did ſeeme to reproue all their counſels and deliberations both in times paſt, and at that preſent. Wherefore they had recourſe in this their generall aſtoniſhment, to that wonted po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie which they had proued to be very profitable the yeare before at the ſiege of <hi>Sfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tygrade:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Amurath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth his camp with ordinance againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaſions of Scanderbeg</note> and that was to fortifie and aſſure their trenches on all ſides with artillerie. They drew downe therefore many ſmall peeces which they had planted againſt the walles, and they beſtowed them in conuenient places round about their campe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they thought beſt: but the greateſt part they placed in that quarter where they had of late found the greateſt danger. For what for the vehemencie of the heate, and what for the encombrance of their infinite baggage, their lodgings were deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded &amp; diſperſed here and there in ſo great diſtance one from an other, and ſo farre off, that it was not poſſible to furniſh and to fortifie all of them. All theſe their endeuors were not long concealed from the Chriſtians, for they wanted not both fugitiues &amp; good eſpials to giue them aduertiſements, but they were certified continually of the doings of the enemie, and eſpecially of this their preparation, which they beleeued to be likely by the example of the like, which they vſed the yeare laſt paſt. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> alſo was reſolued to lie ſtill for a time, and to hold himſelfe contented with that aduantage which he had alreadie gained, and to enioy the pleaſure thereof, till ſuch time as he might find ſome new opportunitie for ſome other happie action. Beſides, there was an other matter which withdrew his thoughts, and whereof he<note place="margin">Scanderbeg remoueth his campe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als.</note> was to haue a care, and that was the ſcarcitie and dearth of victuals, which now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to fall very ſhort: becauſe there was not left in the countrey any liuing creature of whom they could looke for any reliefe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wherefore to the intent he would not be in any wants, and for that he would refreſh his armie in the extreame heate of the ſummer: he determined to remoue his campe, and to leade his forces to a certaine place of ſingular recreation vpon a riuer which the inhabitants call <hi>Iſme,</hi> which lying<note place="margin">Riuer of Iſme.</note> cloſe on the ſea, would furniſh them of all things plentifully and in abundance. And they of <hi>Duraz,</hi> likewiſe (which towne was not farre off) did friendly accord to ſerue<note place="margin">Duraz or Dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rachium.</note> him with as much corne as he would demaund.

            <p>The Infidels in the meane time did nothing for many daies together but batter the towne, and ſeeke to breake downe the walles, in thoſe places eſpecially which the<note place="margin">Battery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued againſt Croy.</note> inhabitants had newly repaired, and which reſted yet vnbattered.

Aſſoone as the wall was beaten downe on that part where the cannon could be brought to play or make any batterie, and that the breach was made faire and large; the ſame daye did <hi>Ottoman</hi> commaund and take order, that euery man ſhould make himſelfe readie to the aſſault againſt the next morning, and to aduenture a new conflict with the enemie: but there was ſcarce any of them, that either openly or priuately did ſhew himſelfe willing thereunto as they had bene in times paſt. All of them did ſet a good face on the matter, but verie ſorily and with an ill grace: for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Turkes vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to a ſecond aſſault of Croy.</note> to refuſe it, or to draw backwards was not the beſt way or courſe for them. <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath</hi> perceiuing this backewardneſſe in his people, and that they were drawen to this aduenture, as it were maugre their teeth: (as the report goeth) he aſſembled the chiefe and principall perſons of all his troupes, who being come to his preſence, with a long diſcourſe, he did thus reproch and obiect vnto them, their faintnes and cowardice.</p>

Anſwer me I pray you. Is there any towne ſo weake? is there any fortreſſe ſo ſimple, or ſo baſe, as that one onely blow and the firſt attempt ſhould be able to ſubdue it? He that will diſlodge ſuch fierce beaſts as theſe out of their dens, muſt of neceſſitie vſe perſeuerance, he muſt ſtand firme, he muſt be of an vndaunted heart and a courage vnconquerable. Haue ſo many puiſſant armies? haue ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Captaines, euen for ſome friuolous cauſe of offence, and for ſome ſmall priuate quarrell, haue they I ſay ſpent their time, and (as it were) waxed olde in the ſiege of cities and fortreſſes? and you that haue receiued ſo many outrages, ſo many indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſo many contumelies of diſgrace by the diſloialty of the Albanians, will you now to your notable reproch, leaue them vnpuniſhed, and vnreuenged? Who is he euen to this day, that did euer obtaine a memorable victorie, and not in ſome ſorte blouddie? Remember the battell of <hi>Varna,</hi> the honor and glorie of which victorie doth ſcarce admit any compariſon. It is vnpoſſible to tame an enemie that is fierce and haughtie without ſome expence and loſſe of blood: and all difficult things doe come to a happie iſſue onely with extreame labours and hard trauell. Vpon <hi>Croy</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth depend the conſequence of this whole warre, which being once at your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, we ſhalbe for euer freed of our enemie in this countrie. For this place being gained which is the principall fortreſſe of all <hi>Epire, Scanderbeg</hi> will not aduenture to continue here ſo much as one day: wherfore plucke vp your hearts (my good frends) and away with this feare and faintnes of courage: you muſt make a triall of fortune: and if you will haue her to follow you, it is needful that you do often importune her. There is no onething in the world, wherein is more varietie and vncertaintie, then in wars and deeds of armes. Hold on your courſe then: ceaſe not to preſſe the enemy, and do you euen wearie him with continuall aſſaults. If at ech time you kill but halfe a ſcore of the enemie, it will be ſufficient, and the towne will be ſoone vndefended.</q>

And it may be (as it happened of late at <hi>Sfetigrade</hi>) that if our forces ſhall not auaile, yet our good fortune may ſecond this our enterpriſe, and may lay vs downe ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention and good meane to atchieue it.</p>
            <p>This ſpeech did reuiue their ſpirits and wrought in all of them new ſtomackes and freſh courages: it cauſed them to baniſh and caſt away all feare: it made their former hatred to returne before their eyes, and it ſtirred in them a ſingular deſire to purchaſe glorie, and in all actions to ſhewe themſelues very forwarde. But aboue all, this did greatly abate the doubt which they had before receiued, for that they ſaw their tents exempted, and their backes freed from the ſudden ſurpriſes of <hi>Scanderbeg:</hi> and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon<note place="margin">Stratageme of Amurath to diuert Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg from troubling his army during the aſſault of Croy.</note> they were aſſured, that during the fight the day following, they ſhould not be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed with any enemie, but only thoſe before them. For beſides thoſe orders which were alreadie taken for all things, and not yet mentioned: this was one which (as I will ſhew you) was laide downe for the diuerting of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> to the intent hee ſhould not of all that day moleſt nor trouble their trenches nor interrupt them from the aſſaulting of the towne. <hi>Sebalias</hi> (of whom mention hath bene made before) was ſent towards another part of the Prouince, that vnder colour of waſting and ſpoiling<note place="margin">Sebalias ſent with an armie to draw Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg from Croy.</note> the countrie, he might delude the Albanois, hoping by that meanes to draw him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with all his forces. In the euening therefore this Chieftaine Turke being diſlod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with a ſtrong companie of 16000. horſe, and hauing ſtreight inſtructions from <hi>Amurath</hi> ſo to demeane himſelfe, that the enemy might haue no occaſion nor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie to fight with him: he rode on his way with good aduiſe and deliberation. By that time that he had marched about ſome 20. miles, the newes of his diſlodge came to the eares of the Chriſtians, which raiſed a ſore murmuring amongſt the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers according to the varietie of their fantaſies which they conceiued and imagined vpon the departure of the Barbarian. Notwithſtanding they were all of this opinion, and one mind, that it was beſt forthwith to mounton horſebacke, and to trauell all the night in great ſilence and ſecrecie, that they might gaine all the paſſages of the mountains and woods where they ſuppoſed he ſhould paſſe. But the ſage prouidence of the Chriſtian Generall, who was an enemie to all prepoſterous temeritie, &amp; durſt not affie himſelfe vpon the doubtfulnes of the dark: did referre the whole to the next morning: and then at the dawning of the day, he departed wich enſignes diſplaied, and held the way of the mountaines, the couerts and ſecret places: alwaies hauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him his vauntcurrers to diſcouer and to beate the waies and paſſages, that he might not fall into the ambuſhments of the <hi>Paynim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the ſame houre that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> departed, the <hi>Sultan</hi> beganne the aſſault againſt <hi>Croy:</hi> for hauing ordained all things (as hath bene ſaid) he thought good to<note place="margin">Aſſault to Croy the ſecond.</note> beginne it betimes in the morning and before that the day ſhould be any thing ſpent: for feare leaſt the aſſault being deferred any longer, ſhould fall out in the extreamitie and heate of the daye.

In like manner ſome there were who forgetting their late loſſe and ſlaughter, did aduenture to approach euen to the port, ſtriuing to breake it open, or to force it off the hinges, and to make way for them ſelues through the ſame by meanes of their mattocks and barres of iron.

and did thereby deſtroy ſome both on the one ſide and on the other: for he did not thinke the head of a Chriſtian dearely bought, which coſt him twentie of his owne company. The defendants though they were not altogether free from dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, yet were they in good ſuertie, neither was there any hazard of the loſſe of the towne: for (beſides their other helpes) ſuch was the naturall ſtrength and ſituation of the place, that it made all the attemptes of the miſcreantes to be in vaine and to no purpoſe. And yet notwithſtanding, if at any time the defence of the place did depend vpon the valure of the defendants &amp; the deuoire of their good diligence, they did euer ſhew themſelues on al hands to be ſtout and valiant, and they gaue maruellous proofs of their faith and proweſſe: and ſtill did they encreaſe in courage, in ſtrength, and in good ſucceſſe. Of the Turkes that aduentured themſelues to the port, there was ſcarce any one that returned: on the other parts, thoſe that were moſt hardie and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturous, did remaine dead vpon the place, and an infinite number were ſore hurt &amp; maimed: and there was not almoſt in any one place but verie few or none of their ladders preſented againſt the walls. Neuertheleſſe <hi>Amuarth</hi> ſtill preſſed on his people with great furie on all ſides: and with a reſolution of obſtinacie more and more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, did continually ſend ſupplies of freſh men, ſtill renuing the aſſault without any intermiſſion: inſomuch as this ſight and ſpectacle did at one and the ſelfe time,<note place="margin">The Turkes repulſed from the aſſault.</note> both feed his humor, and yet torment him to the hart: till in the end being euen glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the pitifull butcherie and murther of his people, he cauſed to ſound a retrait and to ceaſe the aſſault, rather at the prayers and perſwaſions of his Baſſaes, then v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon any other cauſe. For they entreated &amp; humbly beſought him, that he would not ſo willfully and deſperately deſtroy and conſume his armie, conſidering that there was no apparance or probabilitie to get the towne in this faſhion: and that it were better to reſerue his forces to worke by mines into the towne, as the beſt and onely way to bring it into his poſſeſſion. But want of victuals, and the extreame famine which did now ſore pinch the armie of the Barbarians, did cauſe this worke to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede but ſlowly for a time: wherefore to recouer corne and other prouiſions, there were ſent Commiſſaries with certaine men to <hi>Lyſſa</hi> and other places of the venetian territories. For by reaſon of the peace ſworne betwene them, the <hi>Sultan</hi> did perſwade himſelfe that he would denie him nothing.<note place="margin">Scanderbeg marcheth after Sebalias.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Whileſt theſe things were a doing, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> had intelligence by his skoutes, what courſe <hi>Sebalias</hi> tooke in his iourney: who hauing diſperſed certaine troupes of horſemen all ouer the fieldes, did deſtroy the vines and other things bearing frute throughout the countrey. He diſmarched therefore with as great ſecrecie as was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: and being arriued within a three myles off the Barbarian: he choſe out foure thouſand good and ſtrong horſe to charge vpon him in the open and plaine fields. All his foote forces, and the reſidue of his horſemen, he left with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and placed them on a high hill neare to the high waye, where he was in hope that the enemie ſhould paſſe: and he willed him that if he ſaw the Infidels to flie that way our of order &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, he ſhould ſuddenly fall in vpon them, and charge them moſt fiercely: but if he did perceiue them to hold good and to ſtand firme, maintaining the fight with equall fortune and valure and without mouing: that then he ſhould ſpeedily come forward with his companies, and ioyne himſelfe to his forces: and he doubted not, in caſe the enemie durſt abide him, either to make him pay for it and to buy his reſiſtance verie deare, or elſe to driue him to a moſt ſhamefull &amp; diſhonorable flight. For their flight he was nothing at all deceiued: but for the reſt, it fell out otherwiſe then he expected: for <hi>Sebalias</hi> being aduertiſed of the comming of the Chriſtians by the ſentinels which he had ſet to watch of purpoſe: vpon a ſigne giuen had made all his forces to gather,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:13368:120"/>
together and to keepe neare vnto him: excepting ſome few ſcattered a farre off, who became an eaſie prey to the Albanois. And before that he had any ſight of the enemie, he poaſted thence by another way, and not by that where he knew <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> was marching. Thus was there nothing done at that time worthy the ſpeaking: and the rather for that <hi>Caſtriot</hi> kept his forces from following after them: in regard that his footemen were not able without exceſſiue toyle &amp; trauell, to endure ſo long a iorney in purſuing them. Beſides that, the perpetuall care of <hi>Croie</hi> did greatly reſtraine his forwardnes and fierecnes: and he held it more wiſedome to reſerue his armie in good plight for the continuall wants and neceſſities of the towne. On the one ſide therfore the Turkiſh Chieftaine returned to <hi>Amurath</hi> with great ioy and contentment, for that he had ſo abuſed <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> and kept him all that day from troubling of their trenches: on the other ſide the Epirot returned his campe extremely grieued, becauſe he had loſt that oportunitie, and through that perplexity of his mind which he tooke for <hi>Croy,</hi> from whence he was not accuſtomed ſo farre to abſent himſelfe.</p>
            <p>The report goeth, that he met with many vpon the way, who gaue him notice of the Turkiſh Commiſſaries being abroad for victuals: and of the conuoy which they had prouided for the ſafe conduct of the ſame. Whereupon, diſguiſing himſelfe out of hand in ſimple attire (an ordinarie policie which he vſed in the warres) and being<note place="margin">Ambuſcado of Scanderbeg whereby he ſurprizeth the Turke his victuallers.</note> attended with a hundreth ſouldiers in the ſame habit, he followed thoſe victuallers by the tract where they had paſſed: and hauing learned by what way they were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, he put himſelfe with his companie in an ambuſcado. Then ſent he two of his ſouldiers, men of good iudgement and experience, to go to <hi>Lyſſa:</hi> willing them to get notice, and to beare good eſpiall vpon the troupes of the enemie, and carefully to obſerue, whether in their returne they did take any other way, then that by which they had paſſed thitherwards: and if they did, they ſhould poaſt away with all ſpeede to giue him intelligence of it. But theſe victuallers returning the ſame way they went, fell into the hands of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> who hauing ſlaine ſome of them, tooke the others priſoners. The corne, the beaſts and carriage horſes, he conueyed to his campe, where he diſtributed the booty amongſt his ſouldiers. This done <hi>Moſes</hi> returning backe to the campe beſides <hi>Iſme,</hi> brought thither thoſe other troupes of foote, of which he had the leading.</p>
            <p>Whileſt <hi>Amurath</hi> did carefully and with great diligence ſet forwarde his mines againſt <hi>Croy,</hi> ſo much the more carefull was he, and neuer ceaſed to moleſt the beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged<note place="margin">Turkiſh campe before Croy victualled out of Macedonie.</note> with often and continuall allarmes and skirmiſhes: to the intent that by keeping them buſied in the defence of their walles, they might be the leſſe able to diſcouer the drift of his new deuiſes and his ſecret practiſes: during the which he receiued diuerſe meſſages, the one acquainted him with the diſcomfiture of his victuallers, the taking of his corne, and how all things elſe had paſſed: the other from <hi>Alchia</hi> brought him newes of certaine corne which was comming out of <hi>Macedon.</hi> So that as the latter gaue him cauſe of ioy and contentment, ſo the former did renue his wonted griefe &amp; diſcontentments. But the one being partly a recompence for the other, the Turkes were not much moued at the matter, but laying aſide the care of all other matters for that inſtant, the ſouldiers applyed all their care and ſtudie, that the new ſupply of prouiſions might be brought in ſafetie to their campe. Wherefore with the conſent of their Prince, there were appointed 20000. of the ſtrongeſt and moſt able men of their whole armie for a conuoy of thoſe other victuals, to the intent thoſe alſo ſhould not be made a prey to the Chriſtians, as the other had lately bene for default of a good and ſtrong conuoy to ſafeconduct them. But <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> was at that time ſufficiently buſied in conueying his bootie towards his owne campe, for that he might the better
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:13368:120"/>
auoide the enemie, and not any way encounter with him in his returne: he fetched a long compaſſe about by diuerſe by wayes, and with great diſcommoditie and paines, he draue the beaſts loaden with the prey, through the rougheſt and hardeſt ſtreights that he could chuſe within the mountaines, which was an occaſion of no ſmall wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines and toile vnto him, and made him to ſpend long time in his returne: and yet if he had bene freed from that cariage, and though all his forces had bene preſent with him and in a readines: I do not think that he would for all that haue bene ſo deſirous to purſue and ſet vpon the enemie, as to hazard himſelfe againſt ſo mightie and puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant a multitude. All this while was <hi>Moſes</hi> in great incertaintie and perplexitie for the prince of <hi>Epire,</hi> by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was certified by good eſpials of the departure of thoſe troupes out of the campe of the Turkes. And he was in doubt leaſt they were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for his confuſion: wherefore he ſent forth ſome light horſemen, who with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and celeritie, and with great iornies ſhould go ſeeke out <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> and to aduertiſe him of this particular. But they had no tidings of him till he was returned to his people, charged with the ſpoiles of his ſlaine enemies, and the graine which he had taken from them. Likewiſe the Mahomatiſtes without any lette or diſturbance, made a ſpeedie returne with their corne, victualles, and other prouiſions to their campe By meanes whereof, being thus prouided for the neceſſarie ſuſtenance of their bodies: it made them to take a good heart againe, and to reuiue both in ſtrength and courage.</p>
            <p>All this while did they trauell without ceaſing in vndermining of the wall: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit<note place="margin">A myne made by the Turkes against Croy.</note> the exceſſiue labor of the work did ſwallow vp many of them within the earth: notwithſtanding the pioners had their ſeuerall times and houres particularly propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned vnto ech of them: and the like order was alſo obſerued throughout all the ſquadrons, and amongſt the ſouldiers of euerie tent within the campe. The continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all labour, and the obſtinate reſolution of the men did eaſily ſurmount all difficultie, and daylie did they continue their skirmiſhes and looſe fightes before the walles, of purpoſe to abuſe the Citizens. And albeit there was no daie paſſed without the death and ſlaughter of ſome of them: yet did not they account that for any loſſe amongeſt ſo many thouſands of fighting men.</p>
            <p>The Infidels did in ſome ſort ſpend all that time ioyfully and to their contentment,<note place="margin">Venetian ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes ſuccour the Turkes campe before Croy with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals.</note> by reaſon that ouer and aboue their ſtore and abundance of victualles lately arriued from <hi>Macedony:</hi> there was alſo a great number of marchauntes of the next townes vnder the obeiſance of the Venetians, who ſerued them with plentie of corne, wine, oyle, and all ſortes of victualles day by day into their campe: neither was there any want of Mercerie wares, which diuerſe brought thither of purpoſe to traffique with them: who (as the prouerbe is) like flies drawing after honny, did repaire and flocke thither from all quarters, when they once knew of their eſtate: and that their campe was in great penurie of all prouiſions excepting money onely. All this did <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg</hi> ſee verie well: yet becauſe he would not offend the ſubiectes of his friendes and confederates, nor hinder their prinate gaine in particular: he tooke all with great patience, willing his people alſo to diſſemble it as well as himſelfe, without giuing any offence to any perſon either in word or in deede. For howſoeuer it were, he was not ignorant, that though he had hindered this traffique betweene them, yet the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie for all that ſhould not haue wanted it from other places, by reaſon of the neare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Macedonie, Thrace</hi> and <hi>Seruia.</hi> And therfore he buſied his braines with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter matters, and with other affaires of more importance: how he might by force of armes and dint of ſword, and not by famine and want of ſuſtenance, expell this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious enemie out of <hi>Epyre.</hi> This made him to haue an eſpeciall care and regard of a
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:13368:121"/>
matter which was deeply to be conſidered on: and that was to encreaſe and augment<note place="margin">Tanuſee and Moſes ſent by Scanderbeg to leauie a new ſupply of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</note> his forces: for of the eight thouſand men which he had leauied at the beginning of this warre, there was litle leſſe then a thouſand of them diminiſhed and decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: all which were either conſumed in the ſeuerall ſeruices againſt the enemie, or by diuerſe other accidents and diſcommodities: beſides a good number who were licenſed to departe, and were ſent a waye to refreſhe themſelues in their dwellinges: ſuch as he thought had endured ſufficient hardneſſe, and done their good deuoire in the forepaſſed dangers. The charge and commiſſion for this matter was committed to <hi>Tanuſee</hi> and to <hi>Moſes,</hi> who trauerſing and compaſſing all the prouince, did ſcarce leauie two thouſand ſouldiers, whereof fiue hundreth were horſemen, and the reſidue footemen. It was no eaſie matter at that time to find any one man in all <hi>Epire</hi> fit and able to beare armes, but he was alreadie emploied in ſome place either of charge, or elſe appointed to ſome particular ſeruices: ſo well and ſo carefully had <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> ſtrengthened and aſſured all things, with wonderfull counſell and aduiſe: becauſe he would not willingly leaue any angle or corner of his realme expoſed to the iniurie and violence of his aduerſaries.</p>
            <p>During the ſame time that this leauie was made by <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> the Croians being importuned by the daily alarmes of the Infidels could not any longer containe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues<note place="margin">Croyans ſallie out vpon the Turkes.</note> within their walles: but often times ſallying out of the towne, they did with great good happe and ſucceſſe encounter with them. One day aboue the reſt, their ſeruice was moſt notable, at which time there iſſued forth about 500 of the garriſon, and hauing well beaten the enemie of whom many were cut in peeces and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue put to flight, they were ſo earneſt and forwarde in the chaſe, that they purſued them euen within their trenches, which made the Mahometiſtes (when they ſawe the Chriſtians to be ſo hardie and couragious, and that their temeritie did drawe them on vppon this their good fortune) not to grieue verie much at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions which lay ſlaine, becauſe they were in hope ſoone to be reuenged. But this their hope was made vaine by meanes of <hi>Vranocontes,</hi> who though he ſawe his ſouldiers to returne with little or no dammage, yet neuertheleſſe wiſely weighing the danger and hazard of that dayes ſeruice, with the politique and ſubtill diſpoſition of the enemie, he would not from thence foorth any more permit them to ſet their foote without their portes.</p>
            <p>But greater was the griefe, and more notable was the ſlaughter that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> brought vpon <hi>Amurath</hi> and his forces: for his new bandes being vnited and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated<note place="margin">A ſecond can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uazado by Scanderbeg to the campe of the Turkes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Croy.</note> to the bodie of his whole armie, and the ſame being deuided into three parts, one to <hi>Moſes,</hi> an other to <hi>Tanuſee,</hi> and the third reſerued to himſelfe; about the ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the euening, he cauſed his Enſignes to march verie ſecretly &amp; directly towards the campe of the enemie. But before he was gotten as farre as <hi>Monticlea</hi> (which was diſtant about two miles from their trenches) he was diſcouered by the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Sentinels. Great and ſuddaine was the tumult when they vnderſtoode of his comming, but moſt of all where the tents lay neereſt to the daunger. Wherefore nothing was omitted by the Barbarians, neither did they leaue anie remedie vnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, which the vncertainety and darkeneſſe of the night could aduiſe them vnto either for repelling him backe, or for debarring him from entring vppon them. There were gathered together in great haſte and tumult about ſome eight thouſand men which oppoſed themſelues againſt him: which made him to pauſe a little, and with a ſofter pace and more leaſure to march forwarde againſt them. The <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans</hi> aduaunced them ſelues to encounter him, and with a huge crie on all handes were the firſt that beganne the fight: but the Chriſtians refuſing to ioyne
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:13368:121"/>
with them in fight, by litle and litle recuiled backwardes, to the intent that drawing them farther off from their trenches, their fury might be the more abated and dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.<note place="margin">Moſes and Tanuſe inuade the Turkiſh Campe.</note> Hereupon <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Tanuſe</hi> hauing ſodainly entred their rampiers and barriers on that part which was appointed them, had filled al the campe with exceeding feare and confuſion: and being entred within certaine tents, and the watches ſlaine, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied all with the fury of fire, where force of armes could not any way endammage them. Greater was the loſſe and diſhonor without compariſon receiued by them then by <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> for that the Infidels bending all their thoughts and endeuours to that part, <hi>Moſes</hi> had the more liberty euen from the beginning, freely to do execution vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the enemy, by burning, ſacking, and killing all at pleaſure, and to bring their Campe into feare and diſorder, as in all ſodaine actions and vnexpected it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vſed. But this victory was of ſmall and ſhort continuance, for within a while after a more ſtrong troupe of the Barbarians haſtening vpon them, the Chriſtians thought it not good to attend their comming. In one thing aboue the reſt did fortune greatly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor them, in that the artillery whereof they ſtood in ſo great feare, did not at all play v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them: were it that they could not well tell how to vſe it in the darke, or elſe that for the feare wherwith they were ſurprized (as it is oftentimes ſeene) they had forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to aide themſelues with it. The day began now to appeare, when as the Prince of <hi>Albany</hi> giuing place vnto the enemy, did withdraw himſelfe in the middeſt &amp; chiefeſt<note place="margin">Scanderbeg retireth from the enemy.</note> heat of the fight, and retired about 2. miles off to a certaine hil where it was eaſie for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to ſee him, and there did he attend <hi>Moſes</hi> with his ſquadrons: for that was the place which at their going to the charge, was appointed for their <hi>rende vous.</hi> Aſſoone as the Turkes ſaw him there to make a ſtand, they went in great haſt to the <hi>Sultan</hi> his pauili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, humbly entreating him to giue them leaue to iſſue forth, &amp; to ſet vpon him, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him &amp; pointing with their fingers at the ſmall number of the Chriſtians: ſo much<note place="margin">Turkes deſire and obtaine leaue of Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath to iſſue out and to ſet vpon Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg.</note> preuailed their praiers &amp; importunacy, that the old man ouercome with their requeſts condiſcended thereunto. Immediatly therefore there made out 12000. men ſtrong &amp; luſty 7000. horſe, and 5000. foot. Vpon the diſcouery of this great and mighty troupe, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> at the beginning made ſome doubt, whether he ſhould ſtay and receiue them, conſidering the nearnes of the whole army of the Turkes, or whither he ſhould yeeld and giue place vnto the time: but he held beſt for that time to take and chooſe the mid way and meane between both, neither to flie altogether, nor yet altogether to abide: wherefore retiring faire and eaſily by degrees towards the higheſt and rougheſt parts of the mountains, he did temporize and dally away the time: relying both vpon the ſtrength of the place, and the aid of his other troupes, whom by the duſt ariſing in the air by reaſon of their marching, he did now perceiue not to be far off. The Infidels came on, with great fury euen to thoſe hils, but ſeeing the difficulty of the place, &amp; that it was very dangerous to paſſe further, for that the very waight of their bodies would ſufficiently load &amp; hinder them from getting vp, they began to ſlacke their pace. <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi> would not ſtirre, till he certainly knew that his people did approach, yet could not his policy be conueyed ſo cunningly, but the <hi>Barbarians</hi> did perceiue it very eaſily. For turning bridle vpon the hearing of the noiſe of our men that were comming on, and ſeeing their vauntcurrours, they were contented not to approach any nearer, but in great haſt and feare caſting many of their enſignes to the ground, they made awaie<note place="margin">The Turks flie.</note> with all ſpeed poſsible. Neuertheleſſe their great baſt did not altogether preſerue them from the ſword of their enemies, becauſe that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> his ſouldiers had begun the fight with them, and with their ſhot playing vppon them from aloft, they had layed many of them dead vppon the place. On the other ſide the <hi>Dibrian</hi> haſting thither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes with great diligence, did take many priſoners of thoſe that were not able to
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:13368:122"/>
hold way with their fellowes, and the reſidue had free liberty to ſaue them ſelues. The ſucceſſe hereof being heard and ſeene by <hi>Amurath,</hi> but eſpecially the horrible aſpect of that nightes ſlaughter, and the deformity of his Campe, did cauſe him to conceiue ſuch extreme griefe, that for a time it ſtopped vp his ſpeach, ſo as hee was not able to ſpeake a word, which was the occaſion that nothing was either attempted or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined all that day againſt the Chriſtians. The report is, that the next day, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> with a ſmall traine attending him according to his wonted vſe was ſeene by the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> to walke vpon the top of the mountaine which hangeth ouer <hi>Croy,</hi> and there<note place="margin">Speach of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murath touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scanderbeg ſeeing him v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine euer Croy</note> to haue ſome conference with <hi>Vranocontes.</hi> And that this being reported, and his perſon ſhewed vnto <hi>Amurath</hi> by ſome of his men that pointed at him, hee blamed the folly and inconſtancy of his people: and with a dogges laughter (as the ſaying is) he told them, that the beſt way was to let alone that furious and vntamed Lion: and <q>not from thenceforth to feede that vnhappy beaſt with the bloud of his men, that ſo peraduenture he might at length be brought to reaſon by his owne rage and proper fury, rather then by any force of armes that ſhould be vſed againſt him.</q> But as it was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no diſhonour for <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> to heare theſe wordes vttered from the mouth of his aduerſary, ſo likewiſe was it to be taken as a marke of ſingular honour, that he had the power to draw from him this teſtimony, and that he had enforced his enemy to harbour ſuch a conceipt of him.</p>
            <p>But to the matter. Now was the whole army of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> in great ſorrowe and ignominy, and they demeaned them ſelues rather as men beſieged, then as thoſe that beſieged others. Beſides that, to theſe their miſhappes this alſo was added which enſueth, being of no leſſe importaunce, and which alſo did greatly encreaſe their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. The ſecret working of the Mine was now come to the knowledge of the<note place="margin">The Mine of the Turkes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowen by the Croians.</note> inhabitantes: whereupon one night they iſſued forth of the towne to ſee what was done therein, and I know not how they went about it, but it was done with ſuch ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and ſecreſie, and ſo ſodainely, that they ouerthrew and ſcattered the moſt part of their worke, and diſcouered all the doings of the enemy without being ſeene or perceyued by their skoutes, till ſuch time as hauing marred all their implements and prouiſions, they were retired to the towne in ſafety. I do beleeue well that they made choiſe of the dead time of the night, when men being in their ſoundeſt ſleepe, do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the very image and ſhape of death. Yet ſome doe deny that they ſallied forth at all at that time, or that they knew by any ſuch meanes the enterpriſe of the enemy: but they ſuppoſe that the Turkes being not well able to conceale their fraudulent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention and ſecrete workings, the Chriſtians did by their countenaunce and demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, coniecture and grow into ſuſpition of ſome ſuch intent. Whereupon as ſoone as they began to grow doubtfull of the matter, they preſently deuiſed how to ſurpriſe and preuent them in their deuiſe. And they ſay that they did place certaine Baſons,<note place="margin">A deuiſe for the diſcouery of a Mine.</note> and Pannes of Braſſe and other mettall full of water, in diuerſe places, for that by the beating and ſound of the blowes, as they were working vnder ground, the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroakes and rebounding noiſe made with the force of their ſtroaks, would euidently ſhew in what place they did Mine vnderneath the earth. And although they did ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently diſcerne the entry of the Mine: neuertheleſſe fearing leaſt they ſhould be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed by the conueyaunce thereof vnder the earth, becauſe it might be digged tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and winding with great vncertainety, whereby the enemy might be brought into the towne on ſome other ſide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where they leaſt ſuſpected: therefore they had deuiſed and inuented this remedy for a miſchiefe that was ſo doubtfull and vncertaine. It may be that both the one and the other of theſe aſſertions are true, and eyther of them hath ſome likelihood and probability; howbeit as the latter is more ingenious
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:13368:122"/>
then the former: ſo in my iudgement, the trueth thereof is not ſo likely as the other. But how ſoeuer it be, this is one thing not doubted of nor denied by any: that though the <hi>Croians</hi> did litle or nothing feare the endeuours of the enemy, yet did they make prouiſion with good aduiſe and exact deliberation for all things within the towne, whereby they might preuent and interrupt all the pretences which the <hi>Ottoman</hi> might deuiſe againſt them. And therefore as ſoone as <hi>Amurath</hi> knew that the Mine was diſcouered, and that the townes men did chearefully fortifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with all kindes of reſiſtaunce: he gaue ouer the conceipt of all theſe fantaſies, and ſurceaſed from proceeding any further in this purpoſe. But had it ſo fallen out that his deceipt had remained ſtill hidden and concealed from the citizens, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he would in the end haue diſcontinued that worke of his owne proper motion: becauſe that in vndermining of the ground, there were ſo many rockes, and ſtrong banckes of hard ſtone in euery place, which did euer hinder their worke, by reaſon of the neareneſſe and proximity of the mountaine; In ſo much that to haue cleft and pierced through them, would haue beene an endleſſe labour, and a worke of ineſtimable difficulty. And yet there were ſome who would haue had him obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately to perſeuere in the ſame. This care then being remoued, he reſolued to employ his thoughtes, and to proue an other way: the deuiſe whereof was with as litle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite as the other: and that was to ſee if he could by any manner of meanes for money and by corruption, bring the <hi>Croians</hi> to his deuotion. And he held it not amiſſe to haue recourſe to this policy and inuention, ſeeing neither force nor fraude, nor mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and threatnings, could preuaile nor profite him any thing at all.</p>
            <p>Hee ſent therefore to <hi>Vranocontes</hi> one of his Baſſaes, a man of high degree and<note place="margin">An ambaſſage ſent to Vra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocontes by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murath with intent to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt him, and to make him betray Croy.</note> great authority about his perſon, and one that was greatly commended for the dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity of his witte and iudgement. Who (taking with him but two ſeruaunts onely with their handes full of precious giftes, moſt rich preſentes, and ſumptuous orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, after the Turkiſhe faſhion) had inſtructions giuen him, that before he made any mention of the yeelding of the towne; he ſhould offer theſe preſents to <hi>Vranocon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> in the name of <hi>Amurath,</hi> the better thereby to prepare his minde and diſpoſition to the intended and decided parley. This done, he willed him ſubtelly to ſound and<note place="margin">Inſtructions giuen by Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath to his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour.</note> ſearch the depth of his thoughts, and to ſee how he was affected: and ſo with large promiſes of gold and ſiluer, he ſhould practiſe to induce him to deliuer the place into his hands: and to ſhew him how eaſie a thing it was for him, who was the chiefe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunder and gouernour of the garriſon, ſeeing the number of the citizens was but ſmall and ſlender: and that they might be drawen either by loue or by conſtraint, to allow of that which the ſouldiers ſhould accept and like of: that likewiſe the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers would not contradict any thing which he ſhould thinke meet. And that he ſhould moreouer aſſure him, beſides the offers and preſentes ſent vnto him, both he and his people ſhould not want any place or degree of honour which they could deſire in all his Court. The Ambaſſadour Turke hauing this charge and theſe inſtructions giuen him, did take his way directly towards the towne, and as he approached neare to the Port, he was ſtayed by the guards, till ſuch time as the Gouernour was aduertiſed of his comming. <hi>Vranocontes</hi> being ſpeedily ſent for and arriued, the Turke deliuered the ſumme of his commiſsion, and at the firſt as he was preſenting the giftes from <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath,</hi> and did labour with glorious wordes to inſinuate and worke into the fauor and good liking of the Chriſtian, thinking to allure him with his cunning perſwaſions, and to get credence to his meſſage, to the intent he might cutte him off from ſpending further time, and from being more tedious: It is enough (ſayed the Gouernour) and <q>you haue adorned your goodly preſents with as goodly and elegant ſpeaches.

Otherwiſe you may not thinke that we will any way bind our ſelues, vnto you by your curteſies, nor that we will be in any ſort tied vnto you by this bond of your benefites, tending perhaps to our infamy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, vnleſſe we firſt ſee to what end you vſe this your liberality ſo exceeding &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary: for then may we either accept ſafely, or reiect iuſtly your preſents, when your words ſhall haue made cleare and manifeſt the intent &amp; meaning of your hearts.</q>

            <p>The Barbarian being nothing at all abaſhed at the ſpeach of the Gouernor, replied thereunto immediately.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Howſoeuer it be (quoth he) for other matters, we haue not brought you theſe gifts<note place="margin">Anſwere of the Turkiſh Ambaſſador to Vranocon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</note> vnder pretence to deceiue any man, for that were the way to deale with ſlaues and children, and not with free and valiaunt perſons. And although (ô <hi>Vranocontes</hi>) all things proceeding from an enemy are ſuſpitious (as thou haſt ſayed very well and wiſely) whereof we our ſelues alſo are not ignoraunt, yet durſt we not without bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent our ſelues before thee (as the ſaying is) with our handes voide and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Neither oughteſt thou to condemne the gratitude of our mindes, if thou be the man that thou ſeemeſt to be, and as thou art reported to be generally. Receiue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and take in good part theſe preſentes which ſhall not any way wrong thee, nor be any impediment, but that thou maieſt freely, and with full liberty diſpoſe of thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and continue thy former rightes to ordaine of them as thou pleaſeſt. For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou doeſt refuſe and reproue our requeſts, or other things which we haue to ſay vnto thee: (which perhaps doe as much concerne thy good as ours) or whether thou doe approue and allow of theſe preſents offered thee ſo franckly and ſo freely, we will not in any ſort obiect it as a reproach vnto thee. For nothing is to be held or eſteemed more baſe, vile and ſeruile, then ſo to giue, as to expect a profite and gaine by the gift. We are now come vnto thee (gentle and worthy Captaine) freely and of our owne accord: and (I ſpeake it from the very bottome of my heart) we doe not ſeeke to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize thee, neither by wordes nor by giftes, whom we haue ſo often proued to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible by armes and dint of ſword, and who doeſt repute all things inferiour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, and to the greatneſſe of thy thoughtes. This is the cauſe that <hi>Amurath</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth thee, and doth admire theſe rare vertues in his enemy: this is the cauſe he doth deſire (if by any meanes he may) to haue thee neare vnto him. No doubt that is the place, and to be neare the preſence of ſo great a Monarke, is far more fit and conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for thy merites. And there it is that the excellent magnanimity of thy courage, and the dexterity of thy ſpirite, ſhall be able to finde out the way and meanes to mount to the higheſt and ſupreame degree of all glory and good fortune: not that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> whom euen we our ſelues his enemies doe glorifie for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of his countrey, for the defending of it ſo often and ſo valiantly, yet through thy ſuccours and aſsiſtance principally: but thou art worthy of another maner of Prince, and of a better and higher aduauncement, and not to ſpend thy yeares, and to conſume thy glorious life in this obſcurity, and in this vility and baſeneſſe of eſtate. Moreouer <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> his good fortune will vaniſh away euen in a moment, the Deſtinies haue oppoſed againſt him an enemy, who is too mighty for him to endure continually: wel may his puniſhment be deferred for a ſeaſon, but it cannot be auoided: ſo extreme and incredible an hatred hath the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Prince conceiued againſt him. Ouer and aboue the incomparable forces which he hath aſſembled for his deſtruction, he hath ſworne and proteſted not to ſpare any coſtes or expences, nor trauelles, nor daungers, nor to depart out of <hi>Epire,</hi> till ſuch time as he haue ſubdued him, and impoſed a moſt
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:13368:123"/>
deadly and mortall yoke vpon his head. Now ſee how the originall of this miſchiefe doth begin principally with you of <hi>Croy:</hi> we heare him euery day ſounding into the eares of his counſellours theſe and the like ſpeaches: that he will rather ſhamefully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon and forſake his Imperiall city of <hi>Andrinople,</hi> and all the dominions of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and Empire, before he will quit the poſſeſsion of this place: before he will leaue this city vnconquered, and before his wrath ſhall not be fully ſatisfied with the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and butchery of your diſmembred bodies, and there is no doubt but he will doe it, and I doe tremble to foretell it. For though I be one of your enemies (amongſt infinite others,) yet am I a man and haue humaine paſsions: and therefore hardly will my eies be able to endure or ſuffer ſo miſerable a ſight and obiect of your pitifull and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition. Aſſure your ſelues he will not faile to do it, if you do not chaunge your mindes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if now (taking the benefit of his long ſufferance and patience) you do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the ſafety, the light, the liberty, &amp; the peace which are ſo freely offered vnto you: but go to, ſay a Gods name, that this fortreſſe ſo vnmatchable, that theſe walles ſo inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsible, that your valour (which is more then all the reſt) ſhall preſerue &amp; defend you: but how long I pray you will this be? doe you thinke that the <hi>Ottoman</hi> will raiſe his ſiege and remoue his Campe in the middeſt and chiefe heate of this war? you ſhall ſee it to your coſt, you ſhall feele it to your griefe and loſſe, that though his forces profite not nor preuaile not, though all his attempts and endeuours doe proue vaine &amp; boot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, yet (I ſay) you ſhall ſee ſtill before your eies, and you ſhall continually behold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your wals theſe ſame enemies, theſe ſame tents, till ſuch time as the extremity and importunity offamine (which maſtereth and ouercommeth all things) doe in the end enforce you to yeeld, and to ſubmit your ſelues. What other hope then haue you left I pray you? whence is it that this greedy deſire of perils and dangers hath ſeized vppon your obſtinat and hardened hearts? Shall <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> ſupply your wants with victuals being impriſonned within theſe wals? who being conſtrained to keepe cloſe hidden continually in theſe forreſts, or wandring vp and down the tops of the mountains, and being ouerloaden and ouerwhelmed on all ſides with cares and trauels, is ſcarceable to ſuſtaine his miſerable body? Will the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſend or ſuccour you with prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who do daily bring and furniſh vs againſt you, with all ſtore of ſuſtenance and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries for the war, euen in exceſſe and ſuperfluity? Be wiſe therefore, you that are ſo braue and valiant, be you once well aduiſed and take your wits vnto you: behold it is your enemy that warneth you, you haue perſiſted long enough in this obſtinacy: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your countrey nor your liberty ought to be ſo wilfully defended, that you ſhould oppoſe your ſelues for them againſt the wil &amp; pleaſure of the diuine maieſty. It beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth you to yeeld &amp; to giue place to Fortune, and to bend your knees to the moſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſant and mighty. But what liberty is this wherof I ſpeake vnto you? the true liberty, the true rewardes, and the perpetuall tranquillity of this life, is in the power of <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath.</hi> Prouide therfore for your ſelues, whileſt your affairs are in ſound &amp; good eſtate, whileſt you haue yet time to determine vpon it: whileſt that we your enemies do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you, do entreat you, and do loue to entertain you, rather as our companions and friends, with your good liking, then as our ſlaues &amp; priſoners by force and conſtraint.</q>

hearing the ſouldiers begin to mutter, and murmure here &amp; there, as if they had ſome wrong offred them, rather then be perſwaded to yeeld themſelues, he praid the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to giue him leaue, to vſe a word or two vnto himſelfe alone and in ſecret, which was likewiſe accorded vnto him, for they did all much rely &amp; truſt vpon the ſage wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome &amp; conſtancy of that perſonage: being aſſured, that he would not vndertake any thing, which ſhould not be for the aduantage &amp; maieſty of the Realme of <hi>Albany,</hi> and for the profit of ech of them particularly. Then began the wily fox to declare the ſecret which was committed vnto him by the <hi>Sultan,</hi> couering his deteſtable and hatefull meſſage, with the moſt affected and plauſible ſpeeches that was poſſible. <hi>Vranocontes</hi>

            <p>The Baſſa being returned to the campe, was receiued of the multitude &amp; common ſort in great confuſion, for that they had long expected him with great deuotion, and they were come forth againſt him, being deſirous to vnderſtand the reſolution of the beſieged.

The Baſſaes &amp; other his familiars did labour to comfort him with diuerſe diſcourſes, recounting vnto him a world of examples, both ancient and moderne, of the ſudden fall and misfortune of other great and mightie Princes, and of manie ſtraunge and foraine kings and Emperours: but all was in vaine, and his craſed mind would admit no comfort. Notwithſtanding the day following, the old man, albeit he were verie weake and ill diſpoſed in his bodie, the vehemencie of his griefe hauing euen almoſt ſpent and waſted him to nothing, yet did he fall to counſell with certaine of his Chieftaines &amp; greateſt Peeres, who as the report goeth, were foure in number: two Baſſaes, the one of <hi>Romania,</hi> the other of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and<note place="margin">Amurath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulteth vpon his proceeding in the ſiege of Croy.</note> two of thoſe whom they call <hi>Vizirs</hi> or Counſellers. Long time were they in delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vpon the ſumme and conſequence of this war, &amp; they were deuided into three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers opinions. One was to continue the ſiege ſo long, till that the extremity of famine had worn out the beſieged. The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d did aduiſe him to leaue <hi>Croy,</hi> &amp; to purſue <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi> with all his forces: and by that means, though he ſhould not haue his wil of him by force of armes, yet he might peraduenture encloſe and ſhutte him vp in ſome place where by famine he ſhould bemaſter him. The laſt opinion was: that ſeeing they had ſufficiently tried al means, &amp; had aduentured the fortune of al hazards, it was but meer folly to continue there any longer with ſhame and infamy, or vpon deſpite and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation onely to conſume and deſtroy his owne army: but that it were good rather to ſend ſome Ambaſſador to the <hi>Albanois,</hi> which ſhould deale and perſwade with him v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon any tearmes to become tributary to the <hi>Ottoman.</hi> And in caſe he did giue eare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, he ſhould demand 10000. crownes for a yearely tribute. This opinion was allowed as the moſt ſafe: and <hi>Amurath</hi> did conſider with him ſelfe, that this would be a good and honorable colour and ſhew of victory; if before his departure out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> he might preſcribe ſuch conditions to his enemy, and impoſe a yoke of ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection vpon the Prouince of <hi>Albanie.</hi> For to continue the ſiege, they found it very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenient for many reaſons, and they did foreſee a thouſand diſcommodities, which the winter would bring vpon them, and that the beſiegers would be ſooner wearied then the beſieged Moreouer the default and want of victuals, for the maintenance of ſo many thouſands of men for ſo long a times and (which was a thing of more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) the daily courſes and inuaſions, which the enemy was like to make vppon their Campe, were not a litle to be feared.

The firſt place they came to was the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Tumeniſta,</hi> where finding the Prince of <hi>Epire,</hi> they went on right towards the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of <hi>Iſme</hi> vpon the Sea ſide: but there they miſſed him alſo: for the ſame night ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing remoued with all his carriage, he was retired into an open countrey, which the inhabitants call the Red plaine: whereof the <hi>Dibrians</hi> hauing notice by certaine that<note place="margin">The Red plaine</note> dwelled thereabouts, they departed from thence, and within leſſe then an houre they came to the ſame place (for it was not farre from the riuer <hi>Iſme.</hi>) And before they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred all of them into the campe, one of the guides (leauing the <hi>Mahometan</hi> with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) went on before to do his duty to <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> &amp; to know his pleaſure concerning the Ambaſſador. The <hi>Dibrian</hi> being knowne by thoſe of his owne ſquadron, &amp; being entertained and welcomed with many ſalutations and embracements, entermingled with ſome teares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by reaſon of the longing deſire which they had to ſee him, was ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily conducted to their Soueraigne: who hauing ſeene and welcomed the ſouldier, &amp; hauing heard his meſſage, without any delay he ſent <hi>Tanuſee</hi> well accompanied with a good traine both of horſemen and footmen, to go and conduct the Ambaſſador vnto him: who being conueyed to the preſence of the Prince, did not for that day deliuer any thing touching the meſſage which he had in charge from his Maiſter, becauſe the night began to approch: but being entertained with great curteſie, &amp; feaſted moſt ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuouſly, he paſſed that night within the tents of the Chriſtians. In the meane while <hi>Moſes</hi> with a good number of horſemen being mounted on horſebacke, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<note place="margin">Scanderbeg his great care and prouidence to preuent the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine ſurpriſes of his enemies.</note> of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> was ridden forth to courſe vp &amp; down round about, &amp; to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer on all ſides far &amp; neare, both in the vallies and woody places: &amp; the watches alſo were doubled in all the quarters of the campe, for feare leſt vnder this faint ſhew &amp; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, the <hi>Ottoman</hi> ſhould attempt ſome exploit againſt them: ſo that there was nothing elſe done almoſt all that night in the campe of the Chriſtians. Aſſoone as it was day, &amp; that the chiefe and principall of the Armie were called &amp; aſſembled together, <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg</hi> gaue audience to the Turkiſh Ambaſſador: who being formerly prepared of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> artificially framed &amp; deuiſed, thought to haue perſwaded thoſe ingenious &amp; free ſpirits in ſome ſort to condeſcend vnto his purpoſe.

and the ſame deſtinie, neither ſhouldeſt thou dayly behold before thy eyes, thy realme ſo pitifully diſmembred, nor ſhouldeſt thou haue heard ſo many complaints &amp; lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations on all ſides amongeſt thy ſubiects. But ſo hath nature ordained &amp; appointed it, that it is impoſſible to attaine to a perfect peace, or rightfull equitie, without bloud and the violence of armes. Let vs therefore hold our ſelues contented, and take in good part that which reſteth: let vs preſerue theſe ſmall reliques and remainders to ſome better fortune. Sufficiently hath the land of <hi>Albany</hi> bene ouerflowen with the bloud of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind for theſe many yeares: ſufficient is the deformitie and deſolation of this prouince which was ſometimes moſt pleaſant and beautifull, and the moſt flouriſhing ſeate of great and famous kings. God hath giuen vnto <hi>Amurath</hi> mighty forces, and his puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance doth in a maner exceede beyond all humane deſire: whereas thy dominions (ô <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi>) if thou compare them with his, and (if I may ſpeake it freely,) are very ſmall and as nothing. Neuertheleſſe the valour of thy people, thy vertue, and (that which exceedeth all) thy great and admirable fortune, haue made them that they are not to be deſpiſed: whereof thou haſt made a moſt glorious triall in the whole courſe of thy warres. And we our ſelues (though thou be our enemy) haue &amp; do oftentimes both in publique and in priuate greatly wonder and admire it. We doe well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the proude peoples of <hi>Hungary</hi> &amp; <hi>Greece,</hi> that abounded ſo infinitly in goods and wealth, how eaſily they were tamed and ſubdued by our weapons: but this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of yours only continueth inuincible, &amp; is vtterly impatient of our dominion. I do not flatter thee, for I am thy enemy, &amp; I would to God that the things which I ſpeake were not true. Onely againſt you and your countrey (for any thing I ſee) we haue not made any ſhew, that we are either valiant or fortunat: but reaſon would that your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie (ô you <hi>Albanians</hi>) ought to be held ſomuch the more ſuſpitious: the end wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (though it may happen to fall out miſerable) hath ſo puffed vp your ſpirits through ouermuch credulity, as if you had already embraced the perpetuall poſſeſsion thereof, that in the end it will be your ruine and confuſion. And yet if you ſet before your eies all the particularities of your good fortune, this lingring war hath bereaued you like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in ſome ſort of your ſtrength &amp; of your reputation. For albeit hitherto you haue held wars with vs without any great loſſe or diminution of your forces: yet where is <hi>Sfetigrade?</hi> where is that ample and large territory? what is become of the multitude of mannors, buildings, and rich farmes, ſo well planted and husbanded? where is the wonted beautifull ſhew and aſpect of all theſe things? wherefore is this goodly region waſted and ſpoiled? where are all thoſe large garners and ſtore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>houſes of your corne, wherewith both the towns next adioyning, &amp; <hi>Italy</hi> it ſelfe was wont to be ſtored and relieued? and to conclude without touching any other matters, where are the noble and goodly wals of <hi>Croy</hi> which are now ſo battered &amp; deformed, that it ſeemeth, there is ſcarce left any ſhew or token of them? and the countenances of the defendants euen breathing for life, do retaine no part of their former eſtate or of their wonted conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. What is it (ô <hi>Scanderbeg</hi>) that thou doeſt expect further? thou ſeeſt how all things do haſten to bring vpon thee a million of miſchiefs and vexations: of thy towns, ſome are taken &amp; loſt, ſome are preſſed with a ſtrong and mighty ſiege. <hi>Croy</hi> the capitall ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thy countrey, is in a maner brought to nothing, and there remaineth nothing but only the obſtinacy of the people: who though they hold out for a ſeaſon, yet in the end will ſoone be ouercome through pure want. For <hi>Amurath</hi> hath reſolued to augment his forces, and to continue the ſiege al the winter, yea another ſummer: and (if need be) many yeares, till ſuch time, as if the ſworde cannot maiſter them, yet famine ſhall make them to ſtoope vnder his ſubiection. But this is no otherwiſe, then in caſe thou bee deſirous of thy owne misfortune, and doeſt ſhewe thy ſelfe ſo vnwiſe as to
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:13368:126"/>
refuſe theſe conditions of peace with the which I am come vnto thee. Behold how the <hi>Ottoman</hi> in ſtead of being thy mortall enemy is content now to accept thee as his friend and for his tributarie. He will raiſe his campe from before <hi>Croy,</hi> he will lead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his enſignes out of <hi>Epyre,</hi> which he brought hither as an enemy, neuer more to returne againe: and he holdeth it more pretious without bloudſhed to binde this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince by being ſtipendary vnto him, to acknowledge the greatneſſe of the benefit, then to ſeeke to impoſe vpon you an endleſſe and moſt cruell ſeruitude. Now for the greatneſſe of ſuch a benefite he demaundeth of you but a ſmall charge and an eaſie bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then: he is content to take but ten thouſand crownes for a yearely tribute: as for any other thing which appertaineth either to you as your owne, or to him as his due, he demaundeth none at all. Well may you (ô you Albanois, and thou alſo ô <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg,</hi>) without any diſhonour, without any dammage, conſent and accorde in this one point onely, to the iuſt demaunde of <hi>Amurath,</hi> in regarde of ſo many of his Townes in <hi>Epyre,</hi> and ſo many of his poſſeſsions, and ſo many goodly things, which thou doeſt enioy &amp; hold from him, not by any right of inheritance, but onely by vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation and meere violence.

Beſides many other peoples and nations of excellent renowne and antiquitie, all which do willingly &amp; without conſtraint cauſe their tributs to be brought dayly euen to <hi>Andrynople:</hi> much more reaſon haſt thou to yeeld vnto the like, ſeeing it is not impoſed vppon thee by way of bondage and ſeruitude: but rather as a more certaine bonde, and a more ſtrict obligation of thy fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie. Examine well thy owne forces (moſt prudent and politique Prince,) conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all good and happie fortune, and let not ſo excellent an occaſion ſlippe away at this time out of thy handes. If thou ſhouldeſt now reiect theſe conditions of alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which are offered thee, it may be that hereafter thou wilt be deſirous to haue them graunted, when it wilbe all too late, at ſuch time as the eſtate of thy affaires be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chaunged, thou ſhalt finde the countenaunce of the victour more auſtere, and much more loftie and Imperious, but in labouring thus earneſtly and carefully to perſwade thee in this matter: I doe more then ſtandeth either with the maieſtie of <hi>Ottoman,</hi> or the grauitie of my Ambaſſade. Neuertheleſſe I will not reuoke any thing which I haue ſpoken: but rather more then that (if an enemy may any thing preuaile with you) I pray and entreat you, I require and beſeech you: that whileſt it is yet time, and whileſt the old man is in ſo good a minde, you would haue a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde and conſideration both of ours and of your owne eſtate ioyntly both in one. For doe not you thinke (if it fall out ſo vnhappily that this peace be not obtained) that <hi>Amurath</hi> wilbe more diſcontented at it, then we ſhall haue cauſe to be wearied and greeued with it. For certainly therein are we all in particular intereſted, we onely are the men that ſhall ſmart for it, and vppon whoſe heades the whole miſchiefe is like to fall: becauſe for the fulfilling of his will and pleaſure, and to ſatisfie the furious appetite of his paſſions, we muſt vowe our ſlauiſh bodies, and prodigally expoſe and aduenture our liues to all hazardes and accidents, and with our owne bloud, if we can not with yours, we muſt ſatiate his wrath and malicious minde. Euery day muſt we be (as it were) in your bowelles: and we muſt continue in ſhedding each of others bloud: till ſuch time as either one of the two be glutted with doing of miſchiefe: or that our long perſeueraunce, and a certaine kinde of vnhappie fate and deſtinie doth altogether deuoure and conſume both parties.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Ambaſſadour would haue proceeded on forward with his ſpeech, but that the aſſemblie grewe into a ſodaine tumult and commotion: ſome murmured, others
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:13368:126"/>
reioyced and triumphed to ſee, that <hi>Amurath</hi> their enemy and perſecutour, was not now able to do them any more harme, that he was wearied, &amp; euen worne out with the toyles and trauels of theſe ſo long continued warres: and that he was as one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready vanquiſhed and ouercome by their valour, and they could not forbeare from laughing to heare the conditions which his Ambaſſadour did ſeeme to offer, and to propound vnto them with ſo glorious a ſhew &amp; oſtentation of good words. Some of them frowned and muttered, for that <hi>Amurath</hi> vnder a ſhadow and colour of peace and amitie ſhould intend cunningly to worke them to ſubmit themſelues to the yoke, in yeelding their perſons to be tributaries, whom being his enemies, he was not able to ſubdue and conquer. And this I dare ſay, that there was not any one of them, which did like better of this reconciliation that was offered, then that the war ſhould be ſtill continued: nay they did not ſo much as eſtimate it meete, that the matter ſhould be debated by moſt voyces in a full and common councell: ſo mightely are the minds<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> of mortall men puffed vp by the proſperous and happy ſucceſſe of their affaires. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las what is become now of the brightneſſe and glorious renowme of that nation, of thoſe noble and generous ſpirites, and of the ſeede of that inuincible vertue? The <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirots</hi>
               <note place="margin">Magnanimity of the Epirots in the dayes of Scanderbeg.</note> did ſee their eſtate and Empire moſt miſerably rent and torne. Of their townes, ſome were taken, others ſtraightly beſieged, the landes and patrimony of their aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours all couered ouer with men at armes, their wiues and their children remoued and exiled (as it were) farre from their ſight, and euen languiſhing and pining away for very griefe, and with continuall feare and lamentation: the bodies of their friends and fellowes dayly ſlaine and diſmembred before their eies, and all things flowing and drowned in bloud and cruelty: and yet did euery one of them take more delight and pleaſure to remaine and continue in that meane and low fortune, and to ſtand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the guard and maintenaunce of their liberty, with the great expence and loſſe of their bloud, though not without hope of good ſucceſſe, rather then they would in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſort yeeld vnto the Infidell, or to giue vnto their enemies the leaſt ſhew or confeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faintneſſe or cowardize. Wherefore <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> (whoſe minde alſo was euer vndaunted and vtterly vnacquainted with any paſsion of feare or timerouſneſſe, after he had appeaſed their murmuring and the noiſe raiſed amongſt them, he turned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to <hi>Iſup,</hi> and becauſe he would not ſeeme to returne him to his maiſter the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> (as it were) with diſdaine or in ſuſpence, or without any certaine reſolution, he made him aunſwere in this manner.</p>
            <p>That which thou haſt propounded vnto vs (<hi>Iſup</hi>) at this time, is no other thing<note place="margin">Anſwere of Scanderbeg to Iſup his Ambaſſade.</note> 
               <q>(as I now remember,) then was heretofore offered vs by <hi>Ayradin:</hi> who at our firſt comming to this Crowne, did by letters, brought vnto vs in the name of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> demaunde of vs certaine places of <hi>Epyre</hi> and all <hi>Macedonie,</hi> touching which point the full anſwere giuen you at that time was ſufficient to haue ſatisfied you. And I doe not thinke my eſtate ſo much empayred nor yours in that manner augmented, that you ſhould with any face or ſhewe of honeſtie ſeeme at this time to offer me theſe conditions. As for that long diſcourſe recounting the loſſe of <hi>Sfetygrade,</hi> the batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and ruine of the walles of <hi>Croy,</hi> the ſpoyling and waſting of our fieldes and territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, we doe ſcarce account that any loſſe at all, as long as theſe heades are in ſafetie, as long as theſe ſouldiours are in health and well diſpoſed, and as long as our people is in ſecuritie, it wilbe an eaſie matter (beleeue me) to recouer whatſoeuer is loſt, and to repayre that which is deſtroyed, God aiding and aſsiſting vs, it is nothing to deſtroy or to reedifie ſuch things as thoſe, all the while we want not quicke handes and good workemen (ſuch as we haue here) to vndertake them. But aunſwere me (I pray thee) ſeeing thou haſt a delight to reckon vppe our misfortunes, how dearely haue you
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:13368:127"/>
bought and payed for them continually, with what loſſe and ſtore of bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed haue you bought <hi>Sfetygrade</hi> (albeit it was not your proweſſe that carried it, but the ſuperſtition of the beſieged?) And the ſiege of <hi>Croy,</hi> how many of your beſt ſouldiours hath it coſt you? Goe to then, hold on ſtill a Gods name to be braue in this manner, ſo might you alwayes proceede and continue in happyneſſe. For my part I doe not, nor will not enuie it, I can be well content to ſee your enſignes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to continue within <hi>Epire,</hi> to ſuffer my townes to be beſieged and aſſaulted, my fieldes to be pilled and waſted: and whatſoeuer is good in <hi>Macedonie</hi> to be ſpoyled and deſtroyed, ſo long as you beare ſuch like markes and tokens of your good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and ſuch teſtimonies as theſe be of your valure. I proteſt vnto you, I hold it better and more expedient for vs to entreat you not to depart at all out of <hi>Epire,</hi> then to buy your departure at ſo high a price as you ſet vs. God forbid that any age or time ſhould ſee, or that any man liuing ſhould euer heare, that this prouince was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come tributarie, as long as <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> is aliue. Aſſure your ſelues if <hi>Ottoman</hi> would reſtore vnto me the whole &amp; entire poſſeſsion of <hi>Macedonie,</hi> and all the patrimonie of my anceſtours, nay if <hi>Amurath</hi> would deuide with me, and make me copartner with him of all his Empire: I would neuer ſuffer the name of <hi>Albanie</hi> to be ſtained and blemiſhed with this blot of diſgrace and infamie. In vayne therefore doeſt thou heape vp theſe examples of ſtrangers &amp; forreine ſtates: in vayne doeſt thou repreſent before our eyes, the ſubiection of the Peloponneſians, and ſeruitude of them of <hi>Aſia:</hi> for there is no example nor Preſident whatſoeuer of ſo great weight and efficacie, which may moue a free and liberall hart to ſubiect and ſubmit it ſelfe to ſo baſe, villanous and<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> fowle an indignitie.</q>

            <p>The Turke made no further reply being vnwilling to ſtand any longer vpon this<note place="margin">Amurath ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vppon griefe and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.</note> matter: and therefore held it needeleſſe alſo to make any offer of a leſſer tribute, or to follow any further the inſtructions giuen him by the <hi>Sultan:</hi> for he ſawe that the mindes of them all in generall did abhorre to heare of any ſuch ſubmiſsion. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell therefore being riſen, he was conducted with his trayne to dine with <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> in his owne lodging: and after great cheare, &amp; honorable entertaynement giuen him: <hi>Tanuſee</hi> and certaine horſemen did conuey him about a myle from the Campe, for feare leaſt vpon this fauour ſhewed him, the licentiouſneſſe of the ſouldiours might in ſome ſortworke ſome iniurie or outrage vnto him. Scarce was he gotten out of the ſight of the Albanois, but <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> with all his armie, doubting ſome ambuſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the enemy, if he ſhould not ſpeedely remoue from thence, did march away preſently to <hi>Tumeniſta:</hi> where he placed gardes and ſcouts on all ſides, with a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter care then he had vſed at any time before.</p>
            <p>The returne of <hi>Iſup</hi> to <hi>Amurath,</hi> who then lay at <hi>Tyranna</hi> the leſſer: as it did great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly augment his former griefe: ſo did the conceipt thereof redouble the violence of his diſeaſe and ſickeneſſe. The daunger whereof being from day to day aggrauated, and growing more and more ſuſpitious, it made the Baſſaes to quit almoſt all care of armes, &amp; to deuiſe vpon nothing elſe then how to cure &amp; ſuccour the old <hi>Sultan.</hi> But the maladie being vncertaine, and his diſeaſe vnknowen vnto them, they ſaw no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter receipt nor remedy to miniſter vnto him, then to entertaine him with ſtore of good wordes, and pleaſant talke and deuiſes. For his ſickeneſſe being engendred through the impatiency of griefe and diſcontentment, did require to be lenified and mitigated with things confortatiue, purpoſely applied to put away melancholy: and the cure was to be wrought with ſome new and pleaſant delights which might cheare vp his drooping thoughts, and reuiue his ſpirites which were ſo greeuouſly perplexed. This was the eſtate of their affaires for a time, during the which the Turke founde him
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:13368:127"/>
ſelfe thus ſicke and out of quiet: notwithſtanding he could yet for all that in ſome ſort giue audience and ſpeake vnto his people, without much payning of himſelfe: and he was able to giue them directions, and to prouide for manie accidents which ſeemed then requiſite and neceſſarie: till ſuch time as <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> being aduertiſed of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition and crazineſſe of his perſon, did altogether draw out of his bodie that litle ſtrength and vigour which remained, and was yet left either in his members, or in his courage, by meanes of two or three inuaſions which he made vpon his campe. At the firſt and ſecond time there was not much harme done, nor ſcarce any thing executed worth the remembring: for that the promptneſſe and vigilancie of the Turkes in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending of their trenches, did hinder and diſappoint the purpoſe of the Epirot: beſides that, their mindes were more attentiuely buſied rather to the defence of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues then to the offending of the enemy. But this did more &amp; more chafe and incenſe the hardy courage of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> who taking the benefit of the night, as the time moſt proper &amp; naturall to procure tumult, feare &amp; confuſion, marched with all his horſmen towards <hi>Tyranna:</hi> becauſe the place being more plaine and eaſie for horſe to ſerue in, by means therof the tents of the Turks wold be the more ſubiect to the inuaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their enemies.</p>
            <p>It was now paſt midnight when the Chriſtians being on foote, their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming was<note place="margin">A third can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uazado by Scanderbeg to the campe of the Turkes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Croy.</note> diſcouered by the noyſe and neighing of their horſes. The darkneſſe was greater then was vſuall or accuſtomed, and the heauens being couered and obſcured with thicke and groſſe cloudes, did yeeld forth no light nor clearenes at all, and therefore hardly could any thing be done or ordained againſt the violence and furie of the <hi>Albanois.</hi> Neuertheleſſe according to the opportunity of the time did they prouide a remedy: &amp; the ſouldiers were diſpoſed in order according as they could beſt imagine by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, &amp; not hauing the ſight of the enemy. Neither was the quality of that ſeaſon leſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary &amp; ſuſpitious to the Chriſtians alſo. And howbeit that ordinarily, the aſſailant hath more reſolution &amp; aſſurance, then the party that is ſurpriſed, yet did a certen hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ſeize vpon them, &amp; ſeemed ſomewhat to daunt their courages, &amp; not any of them durſt ſet forward or march one before another. In the midſt of this doubtfulneſſe and ſtaggaring (as it were) both on the one part &amp; the other: <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> taking to himſelf about a hundred horſe of his vauntcurrors, &amp; ſeuering himſelfe from the bodie of his troups, aduanced forward with great furie euen to the enemies trenches, to prouoke them to iſſue out: and hauing incenſed them with high cries &amp; clamors, and caſting of darts in amongſt them, he drew forth ſome of them from their appointed ſtations: who ſeparated themſelues from their companie with purpoſe to ſet vpon him, and in hope to haue defeated him: but the greateſt miſchiefe lighted vpon themſelues, part of them being ouerthrowen, &amp; the reſidue were glad quickly to returne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence they came. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> continued for a time courſing vp and downe here and there, and as one that deluded &amp; dalyed with them, he ſought meanes to haue drawen forth ſome greater troupe to charge him: but ſeing the time to paſſe away in this vaine and friuolous expectation, and that the darkneſſe of the night by little and little bganne to weare away by the drawing on and approch of the day: he returned to his companie, &amp; without any further fayning or diſſembling, he ordered his troupes with very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent good skill, and deuided them betwene <hi>Streeze</hi> &amp; <hi>Tanuſee</hi> (for <hi>Moſes</hi> was left with the infanterie at <hi>Tumeniſta</hi>) &amp; hauing readily inſtructed them what they ſhould do, he lead them on againſt the enemie. The firſt onſet was with ſhot, wherwith they plaied one vpon another, and the moſt of the fight was in that order: for the <hi>Albanois</hi> was in doubt, leaſt if the rankes ſhould ioyne, and be mingled together in the darke of the night, his ſouldiers ſhould be ſcarce able to know their felowes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Infidels, for which cauſe he would not ſuffer them to preſſe in vpon the enemy: neither had they
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:13368:128"/>
come at all to handyſtroakes, if it had not beene long of the Turkes them ſelues, who preſuming vpon their huge multitude, did cauſe a ſtrong battallion of horſe, to make out towardes the left ſide, and ſo purpoſed to haue encloſed the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans betweene them. But <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> ſeeing them a little ſeparated from the reſt of their mayne armie, did preſently withdrawe him ſelfe from their trenches into the open fielde, and deuiding his troupes alſo a ſunder, to the intent the fight ſhould be maintayned on both pattes, he made againſt them ſpeedily, and charged them with great furie both before and behinde. At the firſt onſet the Barbarians receiued him with a braue and hardie reſolution, expecting that freſh ſuccours ſhould haue ſeconded them from their campe: but the long tariance and ſlackeneſſe of their ſupplies, and the decreaſe of their owne ſtrength, which by litle and litle fayled them, and the furie of the Chriſtians encreaſing together with the aduantage they had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten againſt them, made them at length to ſet ſpurres to their horſes, and they neuer thought them to runne faſt enough, till they had gotten within their campe. A great number of Turkes and ſome Chriſtians alſo left their liues in that conflict before that the Infidels betooke themſelues to flight. By this time the day beganne to breake, and the multitude of the Infidels beganne to growe ſo great and encreaſe ſo mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they conſtrayned <hi>Streeze</hi> and <hi>Tanuſee</hi> to retyre. The Turkiſh troupes would gladly haue purſued them in their retreate: but for feare to diſpleaſe the <hi>Sultan,</hi> they layde aſide all deſire of reuenge, and buſied themſelues in recounting their owne loſſes and misfortunes. Beſides that ſlaughter onely which was made in the fight, there happened not any diſorder within their campe, neither was there aine bootie or pillage gouen, but onely ſome ſmall ſpoyles which were founde vppon the dead bodies: for you muſt note, that the fight was both begunne and ended without and not within the trenches of their campe. The great men and Chiefetaines of the armie, did very aduiſedly ſeeke to conceale this diſcomfiture from the <hi>Sultan,</hi> to the intent his melancholique humour might not haue any further matter for to worke vpon. Neuertheleſſe they could not by anie meanes keepe it from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the olde man, who was verie iealous and full of care, by meanes of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and publique murmurings and whiſperings, and the priuate plaintes of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort, which did eaſily diſcouer that which was happened, vnto his mind already enclyning and addicted to ſuſpect the worſt. For, as it is commonly ſeene, that none are either more couragious or greater cowards then the popular ſort, in the good or bad ſucceſſe of their fortune: ſo did the Turkes goe vp and downe their campe, deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and debating one with another, and ſaying: That the enemy would at ſome one time or other, finde out ſome good opportunitie to ſet vpon the very tents and paui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions euen of the <hi>Sultan</hi> their Lord and Soueraigne.</p>
            <p>Now was the <hi>Ottoman</hi> greatly perplexed vppon the courſe of his proceedinges,<note place="margin">Turks in great perplexitie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſickneſſe of Amurath.</note> to breake vppe his campe, to raiſe his ſiege, and to leaue the warre which he had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken with ſo great courage and ſhewe of magnanimitie: verie ſhame would not ſuffer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>im. Some counſelled him notwithſtanding to leaue the greateſt part of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces before <hi>Croy,</hi> and with them to continue the ſiege: and that himſelfe ſhould retire and take his iourney to <hi>Andrinople,</hi> and ſo by that meanes prouide for his owne health and ſafetie: for that if he did abſent himſelfe for a while from the bloudie ſight of his enemies, and from the viewe of thoſe tragicall ſpectacles and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities: the force of his deſeaſe would by little and little vaniſh away and be aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. But his health euerie day empayring and waxing worſe and worſe, and his breath by little and little beginning to faile him, they then knew that the immutable decree of the heauens was not to be reuoked, neither by chaunge of place, nor by
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:13368:128"/>
any ſuccours, or humaine counſell or aduiſe. Wherefore although they neuer cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſoueraigne medicamentes and other remedies to ſeeke the recouerie of his health, and to reuiue his decayed bodie (as the mindes of mortall men are neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of ſome hope,) yet had they a ſpeciall regard (as a ſort of marriners or ſaylers who haue loſt their pylots) euerie man to his power and abilitie, to prouide and procure all thinges requiſite, by which their armie might be ſecured and preſerued. Wherefore cauſing their tents to be drawen cloſer and neerer together, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lay diſperſed here and there, and were more ſubiect to the violence of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, they did entrench their campe in a more ſtreight circuit, and within a leſſer compaſſe, garding and defending their rampiers with good and ſtrong forces of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſouldiers. And hauing thus ordered the eſtate of their affaires, they did attend ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the death of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and therewithall an end of this warre: or elſe peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, his health and recouerie which ſhould miniſter vnto them ſome new and freſh plots for the ſtrengthening and reenforcing of the ſiege. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> had notice of all theſe matters, and wanted not daily aduertiſementes to bring this newes vnto him. And many there were alſo amongſt the Infidels, who came and rendered themſelues vnto him, by whom he learned the counſels and moſt ſecret deuiſes of the enemy. For there was not almoſt any one day, but there repayred vnto him a great number ſeeking refuge in his campe or in his townes, eſpecially after that it was once pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely ſuppoſed and commonly beleeued, that the <hi>Sultan</hi> was drawing neere his end. <q>For it is vſually ſeene, that the vulgar ſort doe willingly followe the fortune of that<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> partie which is ſuppoſed to be moſt ſecure and of greateſt ſuertie. Now <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> thought it not beſt to continue his ordinarie allarmes and inuaſions,</q> but rather to referre them ouer, and reſerue his chiefeſt violence till ſuch time as <hi>Amurath</hi> were deceaſed. Neuertheleſſe he would oftentimes walke abroade both by day and by<note place="margin">Crayna a mountaine ouer Croy.</note> night, vpon the toppe of the mountaine named <hi>Crayna:</hi> and there he would deuiſe vppon matters with <hi>Vranocontes,</hi> or elſe he would be courſing vppe and downe the next hilles and mountaines diuerſe times with ſundry troups of ſouldiers, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eyther to ſurprize ſome of the Turkes, as they ſhould be employed in the ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their campe, or elſe to keepe them by all meanes poſſible in continuall terror and ſubiection.</p>
            <p>But this intermiſſion of armes, and the ſorrowfull expectation of the Turkes did<note place="margin">Amurath his laſt end a mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour for great perſons.</note> not long continue: for within three dayes <hi>Amurath</hi> departed out of this life, and left behinde him all worldly fortune both good and bad. A moſt notable and worthie mirrour for the great men of the earth, who in this worlde beeing the mynions of fortune, are too too much puffed vppe with the happie gale of her continuall fauours: and can not abide to ſtrike their ſayles, or to vayle the bonnet to one onely ſtorme of ſiniſter and vnhappie fortune. Howe can it be but thoſe men muſt needes ſuffer ſhippewracke in the ſea of their delitious pleaſures, and in the gulfe of their owne greatneſſe? I holde it not impertinent, if I recount vnto you in this diſcourſe the laſt Acte of his ende and tragedie. The report goeth, that when he perceiued his limitted houre and appointed time to approach, as he lay vppon a little lowe bed or pallet, he cauſed himſelfe ſomewhat to be rayſed vppe, and then framing his ſpeech to his Baſſaes and chiefe Princes of his Court, he made<note place="margin">Complaints &amp; lamentations made by Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath at his death.</note> long and lamentable complaintes, and powred foorth his grieuances exclaiming vpon the Deſtinies which had ſo deceiued him, that nowe the end and iſſue of his <q>laſt actions ſhould be diſhonourable and infamous, whereas the forepaſſed courſe of his yeares had beene moſt glorious: that the heauens ſhould ſo ordaine it, that he, who had ſo often repreſſed the proude and haughtie <hi>Hungarians,</hi> who had
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:13368:129"/>
tamed the inſolencie of the ſtately <hi>Grecians,</hi> and brought their name in a manner to nothing: ſhould be nowe conſtrayned to yeeld vppe his ſoule in diſhonour and reproch vnder the poore walles of a little Caſtle, and in the viewe of ſo contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible an enemie.</q> Then turning himſelfe to his ſonne, he recommended him verie earneſtly to the faith and fidelitie of his ſeruantes: and he inſtructed and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed him touching manie particularities, ſometimes a part, and ſometimes in the hearing of all the companie. And albeit his bodie euen deſtitute of all force and ſtrength, and the teares in abundance trickling downe his cheekes to ſee his childe then ſtanding before him, did euen ſtoppe vppe and hinder the courſe of his ſpeech, yet did he often reiterate and repeate theſe and the like wordes vnto him. Let<note place="margin">Speech and admonitious of Amurath to his ſonne Mahomet vpon his death bed.</note> 
               <q>my example (quoth hee) be a warning vnto thee my ſonne, neuer to contemne and deſpiſe anie enemie be he neuer ſo weake and feeble. There hath not beene (that I knowe of) any one thing, whereof I haue ſo much repented me in all my life time: yea euen in the other worlde (if there be at leaſtwiſe anie part of vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning which hath vnderſtanding after the bodie is extinguiſhed) I ſhall ſtill and euerlaſtingly repent it, that I was ſo negligent and inconſiderate, as to be the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the nouriſher of a domeſticall enemie: whereby I haue both purchaſed this calamitie to my ſelfe, and this perpetuall blot vnto the name and Empire of the <hi>Ottomans:</hi> giuing vnto the whole worlde, and to all ages in time to come, fit matter to talke and to make a ieſting ſtocke of this my ignominious death, and ſhamefull ende before the walles of <hi>Croie.</hi> Euen then ſhoulde this fugitiue haue beene ſuppreſſed, when by that trayterous part which he plaied in <hi>Hungarie,</hi> he intruded him ſelfe into the crowne and realme of <hi>Epyre.</hi> In the firſt beginning, when hee was but yet newly eſtabliſhed, and that the heartes of his people were not yet affected vnto him, the wretch him ſelfe, and the memorie of his name might haue beene for euer extinguiſhed without the loſſe in a manner, of anie of our men. Fondly and fooliſhly was it done to ſende againſt him eyther <hi>Haly</hi> Baſſa, who gaue the firſt matter and encreaſe to his audacious fierceneſſe and to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of his good fortune: or anie other of our Chiefetaines, by whoſe deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or impriſonment, he hath nowe both grounded and ſupported his forces, and hath aſſured him ſelfe of the faith and fidelitie of his ſubiectes: and wrought him ſelfe into the credite and good opinion of thoſe peoples, who were his vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalles. A thing which I (hauing oftentimes thought vppon) could hardly haue beleeued, that I ſhould euer haue ſeene ſo great ſhame and ignominie to haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen me, or that my Empyre could haue beene ſo torne and diſmembred by this warre of <hi>Epyre,</hi> were it not that experience (as a ſchoolemiſtreſſe) hath nowe taught it me, and made me to feele it to my wonderfull great loſſe and diſaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Of eight ſcore thouſande fighting men which followed me into <hi>Epyre,</hi> and did accompanie vs to this place, if you doe nowe conferre vppon the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of our armie, and doe take a diligent viewe and muſter of thoſe which are left, you ſhall finde how greatly they are abated and diminiſhed of their firſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. Theſe fieldes were not ſufficient to entertaine all our regiments, and nowe howe manie tentes are voide and emptie? howe manie horſes doe wander vppe and downe without their olde maiſters? and howe much empayred and leſſened in your forces ſhall you returne home to <hi>Andrinople?</hi> As for this bodie of mine, I ſee the Deſtinies haue vowed it to the territorie of <hi>Epyre.</hi> But wherefore doe I impute the trauerſes and croſſe accidentes of fortune to my owne ouerſight and follie? Seeing the firſt ſeedes and originall of all our miſfortunes hath beene deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from this ſoyle, and that this countrie of <hi>Epyre</hi> did euen watch of ſet purpoſe

to worke vs this miſchiefe? For they ſeeing <hi>Hungarie</hi> in ſuch confuſion of tumultes and rebellions, did incite and ſtirre vp againſt vs the armes of <hi>Eugenius</hi> and other Chriſtians, whereby not onely the ſoueraigntie and royaltie of the kingdome of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre,</hi> but euen the entire poſſeſſion of our Empire, and the crowne of the <hi>Ottomans</hi> was brought in queſtion, and came to be tryed by battell, as the whole worlde may euidently ſee by our trauels and labours ſuſtained in thoſe famous iournyes of <hi>Varna</hi> and <hi>Baſilia.</hi> By meanes of which our troubles, and whileſt we had neither time, nor forces ſufficient to wade through at once with ſo many and weightie affaires, the power of this our enemie (as you ſee) grew to be encreaſed and enlarged. But nowe from henceforth, how or with what ſtratagemes you are to mainetaine the warres, you are not to expect any counſell or aduiſe from me, who haue beene ſo greatly miſtaken, and haue made a wrong account of all things which concerned my owne good, and the eſtate of my owne affayres. Neuer was fortune ſo deceiptfull or falſe vnto me in anie of my counſels or attemptes as in this warre: and it may be that thou <hi>Mahomet</hi> my ſonne, ſhalt finde more fauour at her handes againſt this ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: and for ſo manie honours and dignities which God hath giuen mee, perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture he hath reſerued the tryumphe of <hi>Epyre</hi> for thee. Thou therefore (my ſonne) ſhalt receiue both the Scepter, and the other markes of our Empire: but principally and aboue all, I leaue vnto thee this enemie, charging thee that thou doe not leaue our death vnreuenged: but that thou haue this thing onely and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually before thy eyes, and in thy minde, in acknowledgement of ſo large and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable a patrimonie as thou art to receiue and enioy by me.

            </p>
            <p>This diſcourſe ended, his ſpeech beganne to faile him, and drawing on neere<note place="margin">Amurath his death.</note> towardes his ende, he lay about halfe a day as it were in an agonie or extaſie. And then his eyes being couered with endleſſe and eternall darkeneſſe, hee yeelded vppe his ſoule to the wonderfull ioy and contentment of manie millions of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
            <p>The hearing of theſe things is a matter of no ſmall import, and it is a worlde to ſee the great men of the earth, howe they doe holde the eſtates and kingdomes of this worlde in ſo high an eſtimation: and doe prize humaine and momentarie things at ſo great a rare. And they doe perſwade themſelues, that it is poſſible to get ſuch a perpetuitie in the poſſeſſion of fortune, that it ſhould at no time be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie<note place="margin">Amurath his manifold ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploites and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous actes.</note> or croſſing vnto them. What did that age yeelde more great then <hi>Amurath?</hi> who of all men then lying vpon the face of the earth, (be it ſpoken without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence) was of more glorious and high renowme then he? who had euer more notable teſtimonies and tokens of worldly felicitie? who did in his time attaine to more famous tryumphes then <hi>Amurath?</hi> who by the ſpoyles of ſo manie migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Kinges and Princes, and by the ruine and conqueſt of ſo manie proude and loftie Nations, did reſtore the name of the <hi>Ottomans</hi> being in a manner cleane defaced, and did enrich the houſes of the barbarous Infidels? This Prince was he that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſuppreſſed the furie of all domeſticall and ciuill warres, did giue the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and commencement vnto the greatneſſe of his fortune by the bloude and ſlaughter of his owne naturall brother. He was the firſt of the Turkiſh Princes, that did ſuppreſſe and diminiſh the libertie of the madding and franticke <hi>Greekes,</hi> and eſtabliſhing his Empire euen in the center of their bowels, did from thence enlarge and augment his forces: wherewith afterwardes he afflicted and tormented the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations of Chriſtendome with ſo many miſeries and calamities, that it is almoſt
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:13368:130"/>
impoſſible for the tongue of man to number them. This was he that firſt brake downe &amp; ouerthrew that wall of the <hi>Greekes</hi> at the entry of <hi>Morea</hi> adioyning to the <hi>Iſthme</hi> or Snake of <hi>Corinth</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly called <hi>Hexamile,</hi> by meanes wherof he made all<note place="margin">

But ô how are his thoughts now changed! ô how farre doe thoſe his laſt ſpeeches differ from the courſe of his forepaſſed life! being now heard to powre forth ſuch vile and baſe complaints, &amp; to lament ſo ſhamefully, euen in the view of an enemie, of whom in time paſt he made ſo ſmall reckoning and ſo little eſtimate? where were then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the haughtie thoughts of his vndaunted ſpirit? his arrogant and imperious<note place="margin">Amurath an example of the vanitie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancie of worldly bliſſe and fortune.</note> voice? which ſo many braue Chieftaines and Leaders, ſo many troupes and legions, ſo many thouſands of armed ſouldiers were wont to heare with feare and trembling? Oh how the caſe is now altered, the man is now of another manner of viſage, of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other kind of countenance, of another aſpect. Where is that head adorned with ſo many trophees and goodly tryumphes? where is that royall and princely hande that ſwayed ſo many Scepters? where is the puiſſance, the power, the ſtrength of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie that commaunded ouer ſo many kingdomes, nations, and peoples?

The king of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banie</hi> was receiued with a maruellous concourſe of people: and <hi>Vranocontes</hi> was the firſt that entertained him with infinite embracements: who after he had kiſſed him (as the faſhion is) the others according to their degrees and callings, did likewiſe wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him. There was not any of the common people, but did teſtifie their ioy and gladnes of his comming: ſometimes proſtrating themſelues (according to their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) at the feete of their Prince, and ſometimes handling the skirtes of his robes and veſtiments, they would embrace and kiſſe them with great deſire &amp; affection. Then began they to expreſſe and make ſhew of their exceeding ioy, with all kinds of accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, melodies, and inſtruments of muſicke, with ringing of belles, with bonfiers, with feaſting and banqueting, and whatſoeuer elſe which in the comentment of their hearts they could any wayes imagine or bethinke themſelues. The Croians were highly commended and extolled with many praiſes and good commendations both<note place="margin">Rewards giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the citizens, ſouldiers and Gouernor of Croy by Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg.</note> in publique and in priuate, for their deuoire and dutie ſo faithfully and valiantly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. The garriſon likewiſe beſides their appointed pay, had great and large ſums of money giuen them for a recompence with many good and rich garmentes. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the gouernour, beſides great ſtore of gold and ſiluer: <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> gaue him two coate armours of purple, and one other richly wrought in gold, and foure goodly manours for the reward and recompence of his vertue and good ſeruice: and laſt of all beyond his expectation, though not vndeſeruedly, he honored him with a higher title, and created him Duke of <hi>Emathia:</hi> giuing him the preſent inueſtiture and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that dignitie.</p>

in a manner ouer the whole world: and there could nothing haue happened more wiſhed and deſired, nor more wellcome to all the eſtates of Chriſtendome. <hi>Hungarie</hi> began to take breath: <hi>Greece</hi> came againe to take heart and courage to it ſelfe, and ſhe ſeemed to be deliuered (as it were) out of bondage, and her bonds to be broken, and rent aſſunder. All men had their mindes and ſpirites lightned and erected with hope vpon the report of this good accident: and they did attend ſuch a chaunge and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fortune of moſt kings and Princes, that they did expect the renuing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of their former eſtate and condition.

               <p>MAhomet is crowned Emperour of the Turkes. His gouernment, manners, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon are deſcribed. Scanderbeg at the entreatie of his ſubiectes is maried.

Ameſe one of Mahomet his Chieftaines is ſent with an armie against Scanderbeg: by whome being ſuddenly ſurprized, in the battell of Modriſſa, his armie is diſcomfited, and the Turkiſh Generall himſelfe is taken priſoner.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the former ſixe bookes we haue repreſented vnto you as vpon a Theater, thoſe two excellent and incomparable war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours <hi>Amurath</hi> and <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> by the ſucceſſe of whoſe armes being ſo variable and diuerſe, you may eaſily contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate how the courſe of fortune hath a kind of declining and decaying age, which in proceſſe of time maketh her (as it were) to waxe colde, and to diſcontinue the largeſſe and bountie of her wonted fauours. And how ſoeuer ſhe doth frankely and voluntarily accompanie great minds and high aſpiring natures, whileſt the heate of youth doth ſtirre vp their bloud, and enflame their haughtie courages: yet when gray haires doe by little and little approach and bring on colde and vnweldie old age, then doth fortune alſo ſeeme to grow olde and waxe faint and heauy, by meanes whereof that goodly luſtre and bright beautie of their former glorie doth ſeeme to be eclipſed and to vaniſh quite away. Examples thereof are the ruines of thoſe famous Monarchies of <hi>Ninus, Cyrus, Alexander</hi> and that great Romaine Emperour <hi>Auguſtus:</hi> beſides many other excellent Princes and Captaines which euen in this our owne age, haue beene made liuely markes of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes inconſtancie, who in their young yeares, hauing had the ſunne beames of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:13368:132"/>
gloriouſly ſhining vpon them, and fortune hauing alwaies followed them in their warres, that they ſeemed to haue her at commaund: yet in their elder yeares they haue bene forced to proue the inconſtancie of her frownes and diſſauorable aſpect. And truly my opinion is, that God euen of his diuine prouidence, doth vſe &amp; enure men to theſe caſualties and accidents, becauſe he would haue the great men of this world to know and acknowledge, that it is he onely and no other, that diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and diſpoſeth of proſperitie and aduerſitie: to the intent alſo that humaine and earthly things ſhould not ſeeme vnto fooliſh mortall men to haue any durable continuance or eternitie: conſidering that there is nothing ſolide, ſtable, or perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent here below, nor any thing vnder the ſunne, wherein may be found perfect hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines. And if any one thing haue any ſhew and appearance of felicitie, it is ſo brittle, fraile and vnconſtant, that euen then when men thinke to haue moſt ioy of it, and to enioy the pleaſures and profits of the ſame, ſuddenly and immediately they ſee it gone and decaied: ſuddenly and immediately they perceiue it waſted and conſumed.</p>
            <p>Such was the ende and death of <hi>Amurath,</hi> which being heard and beleeued at <hi>Andrinople,</hi> did ſtirre vp diuerſe motions both in the affaires and mindes of men. The great men and Nobles of the citie (as thoſe which had neuer miſliked neither of the felicity nor gouernment of this Prince) were very ſorrowfull, and did for a long time<note place="margin">Amurath best beloued by his ſubiects and moſt vpright to his enemies of all the Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Princes.</note> bewaile and lament the olde man, partly for the common loſſe (for the report is, that of all the <hi>Ottoman</hi> race, there was neuer any one of them better beloued of his people, nor more iuſt &amp; vpright to his enemies) partly alſo for that they were not ignorant, that the chaunge of the crowne and dignitie roiall, could not happen without infinite dammages, and the ruine of many in particular. But the ſtirring heades and ſuch as were deſirous of a chaunge and new alterations, did litle grieue at this chance: but rather on the contrarie were the more in heart, and did conceiue great hopes in their imaginations: becauſe they had of a long time wiſhed, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> whom they knew to be a young Prince fierce and ambitious, might come to the crowne, and get the poſſeſſion of the imperiall ſcepter. The popular and common ſort (who of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues are naturally deſirous of nouelties and alterations) did entertaine theſe tidings <q>
                  <note place="margin">Sentence.</note> with great ioy and contentment. But aboue all, the Ianiſſaries (which are called, the Prince his Enfants, reioyced exceedingly: and running vp and downe the ſtreetes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, did fall to ſacking and ſpoiling freely and without controlment,</q> of the goods<note place="margin">Cuſtome of the Ianiſſaries to ſacke the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Iewes and Chriſtians at the death of their Prince,</note> and houſes of many perſons, eſpecially the Chriſtians and the Iewes: who are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally abhorred and hated of the Turkes. For ſuch is the licenſe and libertie, or rather the damnable cuſtome of that people, that at the deceaſe &amp; death of their ſoueraigne, this is vſually and ordinarily permitted and granted vnto them.</p>
            <p>It was a wonderfull thing to ſee the concourſe and great reſort of people of all ſorts and degrees, that flocked daily to the imperiall citie of <hi>Andrinople</hi> to ſee the new king, and the triumphes of his coronation, which was the cauſe that an incredible multitude went to meete <hi>Mahomet</hi> as he returned with his armie. The Ianiſſaries<note place="margin">Mahomet crowned Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of the Tur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

And at the ſame time were the publique treaſures deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vnto him: and the Baſſaes and other officers of the crowne did ſweare vnto
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:13368:133"/>
him fealtie and obedience. Theſe things thus accompliſhed, the people had a great largeſſe both of golde and ſiluer in all the ſtreetes of the citie: beſides the liberall rewardes giuen to the ſouldiers. Thus was the auncient faſhion and ceremonie of this Nation in the creating of their kings partly obſerued, and partly not, in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of <hi>Mahomet</hi> to the crowne. For the firſt thing that the Turkiſh kings do vſe and accuſtom is, to abſent their children: and to keepe them out of <hi>Europe</hi> in thoſe<note place="margin">Emperours of the Turkes the maner of their ſucceeding to the crowne.</note> Prouinces of <hi>Aſia</hi> which are moſt remote and fartheſt off: euen aſſoone as they are gotten out of their infancie. And the cauſe thereof as I take it is this, for that they ſhall not practiſe and conſpire againſt their fathers through a curſed humour of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and deſire of raigne and Empyre, from the which, there is ſcarce any age or perſon exempted, but hath ſome inſtinct and naturall motion thereunto. Afterwards <q>when it happeneth that the Emperour is deceaſed, or that it is thought that his death<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> is not farre off: the Baſſaes and others, (who are of greateſt power and authoritie both with the people,</q> and in the gouernment of the eſtate) doe ſend away ſpeedie poaſtes and letters to the one and other of the ſonnes of the Prince laſt deceaſed, according as eche man is particularlie affected: and they doe from point to point aduertiſe him of all things: willing him to haſten his comming, that he may get the poſſeſſion of the crowne, and ſeate himſelfe in the ſucceſſion of the Empyre, then readie to fall voide and emptie. It is a ſport to ſee with what contention theſe great men doe ſtudie to ſurprize the packettes and curriers of each other: whileſt that euerie one of them laboureth to get the ſcepter to that partie, to whom he is moſt affected and euerie one doth his beſt and worſt to beguile his companion. Nowe when theſe young Princes are thus ſollicited: with what vehemencie, with what fancies and affection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they do come poaſting from all partes to beare away the prize thus in queſtion; I leaue it to your imagination. Certaine it is; that he amongſt them all that can firſt get to the ſtreights of <hi>Gallipolie</hi> or <hi>Helleſpont:</hi> he commonly is the man that obtaineth the ſoueraignitie of the Empire, for that the <hi>Ianiſſaries</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to meete and to ſalute him, doe afterwardes all at leaſure, eaſily and quietly put him in poſſeſſion of the kingdome. The other brethren are forthwith eyther ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed or exiled out of all the territories and limits of their dominions: or elſe are cruelly and vnnaturally ſlaine and murthered, for feare leaſt there ſhould remaine <q>ſo me cauſe of ciuill tumults and ſedition. Hence is deriued that prouerbe vſed by<note place="margin">Prouerbe of Princes chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> the auncients, That more fortunately are children borne to priuate perſons, then to Princes.</q> But now of all this, nothing could happen in this manner vnto <hi>Mahomet,</hi> for neither had he any brethren of ſufficient age, eyther fit to gouerne the Realme, or able to attempt or to obtaine the kingdome: neither did he returne as a priuate perſon out of <hi>Aſia,</hi> but with a moſt ſtrong and mightie armie which he brought backe out of the enemies countrie, where he had bene before ſaluted and proclaymed King and Emperor by the vniuerſall conſent of all the ſouldiers in generall. For this cauſe he came peaceably and quietly to the Empire, without any commotion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any danger or difficultie, and with the exceeding ioy and incomparable gladneſſe of the whole Communaltie. Now had they forgotten the loſſe of their late deceaſed Prince, and all griefe and ſorrowe for his death was vaniſhed together with his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie. The calamities and ſlaughters lately receiued in <hi>Epyre,</hi> and the obſequies and funeralles of their companions, were nowe cleane worne out of minde, and there was ſcarce any one by reaſon of this newe pompe and tryumphe which did apperceiue or obſerue the poore reliques of their miſerable defourmed armie, or that did remember (by reaſon they were ſo drowned in ioy) what goodly forces, and what ſtrong ſquadrons they had ſent into <hi>Epyre,</hi> in reſpect of thoſe which were
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:13368:133"/>
thence returned, and were brought home againe.</p>
            <p>The new Monarke, whoſe delight was in bloudſhed and cruelty, as much as any<note place="margin">Mahomet his cruelty &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety.</note> that euer raigned, thought it good to looke to his affaires, and to prouide for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of his eſtate, and he had an intention to ſettle ſome of them in good aſſurance, and of others to make a change and innouation. The firſt deede that he did was to make diligent inquiſition, if he could finde any other aliue beſides himſelfe, that was deſcended from the loines of <hi>Amurath,</hi> vpon whom after the maner of his predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors he might poure out the venome of his hatefull ambition. There were found two infants, the one called <hi>Turſines</hi> of the age of eighteene moneths, the other was called<note place="margin">Turſines, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met drowned.</note> 
               <hi>Calepin.</hi> The former was caſt into the water and drowned by the expreſſe commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who gaue it in charge to <hi>Moſes</hi> one of his Baſſaes to ſee it exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and he without any difficulty or relenting, did eaſily yeeld to aſsiſt ſo execrable a ſpectacle. The mother of the infant deteſting the deede, and exclaiming vppon the brutiſhnes of the fact, with howlings and horrible cries intermingled with continuall tears and lamentations, did poure out a thouſand curſes againſt the author of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being there in preſence.

               <hi>Mahomet</hi> purſuing his blouddy beginnings, as one that would not omit any thing of his former furious proceedings, did daily deuiſe &amp; ſuborne new ſlanders and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations<note place="margin">Mahomet his tyranny and miſchieuous manners.</note> againſt the greateſt perſons of his Court, and his fathers ſeruants: and vnder co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of calling them to an account, ſome of them he cauſed to be put to death, and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers he would procure the goods &amp; offices to be confiſcated, in ſuch ſort, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a very ſmall time (according as before his comming to the Crowne he had ſecretly plotted and purpoſed in his conceipts) he became terrible and more to be redoubted, then is fitting for a king, and he grew odious and hatefull almoſt to all his ſubiects. He altered and changed in a manner all the ſtatutes and ordinances of his aunceſters, and all the lawes and conſtitutions both ciuill and military: ſometimes reforming and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting them, ſometimes adding of new vnto them, he ſurcharged and burthened his people with new impoſts and ſubſidies: and he bental his endeuours more then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his predeceſſors to amplify and augment the numbers of the <hi>Ianiſſaries,</hi> and of his men at armes, and to enrich and encreaſe his treaſures. For amongſt many of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wicked conditions, the humor of auarice and couetouſnes had that command o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer him, that the meane and ſimple order both of his diet and apparell, was reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully<note place="margin">Mahomet his notable vices and vertues.</note> obiected vnto him as a vice: and it was ſuppoſed that his exceſsiue ſparineſſe and abſtinency, proceeded only of a miſerable and couetous humor. All men doe attribute vnto him a certaine liuelineſſe and viuacity of ſpirit, euen more then humaine, a heart couetous and greedily thirſting after glory, and not vnlike to that of the great <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> And it is moſt certaine, (as we haue partly before touched) he did excell all men li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in cruelty, vſing (as the ſaying is) a rod of iron, both againſt his ſubiectes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſtrangers, and he ſhewed himſelfe to haue as litle care of the bloud and life of his owne people, as of his foes and moſt mortall enemies: in ſuch ſort, that vppon euery ſleight and trifling occaſion, he would put to death euen thoſe litle boies and laddes,<note place="margin">Seraill, a place where the Turk vſeth to keepe his concubines.</note> whom he loued voluptuouſly, and which he kept within his * <hi>Serayl</hi> for the fulfilling of his beaſtly pleaſure. On the contrary, he was a moſt francke and liberall rewarder of thoſe men, who were of a quicke and ready ſpirite, and ſuch as were of valour and great courage, and of them which did ſerue him faithfully and loyally. For periury there was neuer any man more notorious, for he neuer kept faith nor promiſe with any perſons whatſoeuer. Moreouer many haue bene of the opinion, that he did not beleeue in the law of <hi>Mahomet</hi> their owne Prophet, no more then in the Goſpell of Chriſt. For albeit he was born, bred, &amp; inſtructed by his mother, who was the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>George Deſpot</hi> of <hi>Seruia,</hi> and profeſſed the Chriſtian religion, and taught him the <hi>Pater noſter, Creede,</hi> and <hi>Aue Maria,</hi> yet when he came to ripe yeares, and that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke<note place="margin">Mahomet a notable Atheiſt worſhippeth good Fortune only as God.</note> himſelfe to the embracing of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> profeſsion, he did ſo litle cleaue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the one or to the other, that he liued a meere Atheiſt, and acknowledged, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, nor adored any other Deity, but that alone which he called good Fortune. Hee did maruellouſly honor and eſteeme thoſe, which were skilfull in any Art or myſtery whatſoeuer, and he tooke great care that his victories and conqueſtes might be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by learned men, and thoſe that were of iudgement: he delighted infinitely in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding<note place="margin">Iohn Maria of Vicentia ſlaue to Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtapha eldeſt ſonne of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet.</note> of the Hiſtories of the auncients, he was very skilfull and learned in the Greeke, Perſian, and Arabian tongues, he made great ſhewes of loue and kindneſſe vnto <hi>Iohn Maria</hi> of <hi>Vicentia,</hi> the ſlaue of his eldeſt ſonne <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> becauſe hee would haue had him to write in the Turkey and Itatian tongs, the famous victory which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

Moreouer he was a curious obſeruer of the Starres and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, according to the courſe and motion of the which, he ruled and directed all his actions. Beſides, he had in his mind euen with his cruelty, ſome impreſsion and ſhew of iuſtice and ſeuerity, in ſo much that during his raigne, all the paſſages and high waies were free, open, and ſafe for trauellers, and the name of theeues and robbers was wholly extinguiſhed and aboliſhed. A great warriour he was, ſtrong and valiaunt of his perſon, hardened and enured to endure watchings and trauels with notable pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: happy and fortunate in moſt of his actions: and (to ſpeake in a word) he was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen a king of Fortune, which made him worthy of the Empire of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> As touching the forme and feature of his viſage, and the making of his body, he was of a<note place="margin">Deſcription of Mahomet.</note> meane, or rather of a ſhort ſtature, which notwithſtanding did containe within a great heart, and full of magnanimity. He was pale of face and of a ſallow complexion correſpondent vnto his courage: his looke and aſpect was frowning, fierce, and terrible, his eye browes hollow, and his noſe ſo high and crooked, that the point thereof ſeemed to touch his lippes. His ſhoulders were large and ſquare, and all the members and lineamentes of his body, were ſtrong ſet and very well made, and with ſuch ſtrength, and vigour in his armes, that (at ſuch time as <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> liued with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murath</hi> his father, amongſt all the youths of the Court, he would yeeld and giue place to none but to him only in drawing the bow or in wraſtling.</p>
            <p>It may be that I haue buſied my ſelfe about <hi>Mahomet</hi> more then needed, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that my purpoſe was not to deſcribe his life nor his maners, but the life of <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi> onely.

For now from henceforth will not true valour be able to ſhew it ſelfe: to no purpoſe is it for ſouldiours to vſe the Art of fighting, and to practiſe the skill of weapons: and in vaine is it to learne to handle the ſword, the buckler, and ſuch like, or to practiſe any other kind of fight hand to hand. And what then? forſooth they vſe now to fight aloofe, and to make warres a farre off, and field ſeruices conſiſt moſt in looſe and light skirmiſhes. But returne we from whence we haue digreſſed. Amongeſt other fortifications newly made in the towne of <hi>Croy,</hi> at the gate of the towne <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> cauſed a great and ſtrong towre to be builded: the walles whereof, from the bottome vpward, went not ſtraight and euen vpright, but were raiſed a ſlope and bending in manner of a counterſcarfe, to the intent the Cannon ſhould be the leſſe able to play vppon it. The other partes and quarters alſo of the towne, both within and without were repaired and fortified without any intermiſſion, by the aduiſement and directions of good and skillfull Enginers.</p>

Eſpecially now at this time, when all things (as they ſayed) were exempted from feare and miſtruſt: and now that all daungers were ouer gone and paſt, and that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies were withdrawen from all care of Armes, both by reaſon of their late miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, and by the motions and tumults which doe vſually accompany the change of a new King at his firſt comming to the Crowne: that he ought not to fruſtrate the hearty wiſhes and deſires of ſo many peoples his ſubiects and confederates of this ioy and comfort, eſpecially in ſuch a ſeaſon (for it was in the moneth of May, when all things did ſeeme to reioyce and flouriſh) and which did inuite him thereunto, with promiſe of nothing but ioy, mirth, and gladneſſe. That therefore he ſhould ſuffer him ſelfe once to be entreated and perſwaded by his people, who would take more pleaſure and contentment in this onely, then in all his victories obtayned againſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murath.</hi>

Albeit the Prince of <hi>Albany</hi> were vnwilling to enter into this band, yet weighing all matters and circumſtances with iudgement and ſound aduiſe, it ſeemed vnto him more expedient and for his honour to conſent thereunto, then to hold off and to vary from his former promiſe which he had made vnto them the yeare laſt paſt, at the inſtant and earneſt requeſt of all his ſubiectes. For this cauſe he condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended vnto their deſire, and committed the care of the whole matter to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and wiſedome of <hi>Muſache Thopie,</hi> his ſiſters ſonne, and ſome two or three others, to whom he imparted his minde in that behalfe. At that time <hi>Ariamnites</hi>

               <hi>Comminat</hi> (of whom hath beene before ſpoken) did excell all the Princes and Lords of <hi>Epire,</hi> both in puiſſaunce and largeneſſe of dominions, as alſo in nobleſſe and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of bloud, he had one daughter named <hi>Doniqua,</hi> worthy (no doubt of ſuch<note place="margin">Doniqua the wife of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg.</note> afather,) and the true <hi>Idea</hi> and Image of all perfection of beauty, (which is one not of the leaſt excellenceſſe, and a thing not meanely reſpected in women.) Wherefore <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> tooke no care for any other match, nor <hi>Ariamnit</hi> for any other huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band for his daughter. The conditions and couenaunts of the mariage were as ſoone and eaſily agreed on and diſpatched, as they were thought vppon and deuiſed: <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi> referring it to the diſcretion of the father, to determine of his daughters dowry, and as it liked him to ordaine and nominate it, ſo was it freely and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily accepted. Neuertheleſſe it was correſpondent and aunſwerable to dignity, both of him which gaue it, and of the perſon alſo which receiued it. The eſpouſals were preſently celebrated and ſolemnized, and without any delay at all. Great were the triumphes and publique reioycings of all the Prouince at this mariage, and the<note place="margin">Mariage of Scanderbeg.</note> Bride was as ſpeedily brought home with a Princely traine, and moſt royally accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied, by all the neighbour Princes, and almoſt all the nobility of the countrey, who did honour the feaſt with great pompe and incomparable magnificence. Such as could not be preſent did honour them with their Ambaſſadours, and moſt ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous preſents. All in generall did reioyce at this ſtraight knot of affinity, betweene theſe two the moſt puiſſaunt Princes of <hi>Albany,</hi> which gaue them ſome appearance and probability of hope, that in time to come their forces being vnited would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue and defend the prouince againſt all inuaſions and perils of the warre whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. The Seigniours of the eſtate of <hi>Venice</hi> did teſtifie both by an ambaſſade, as alſo by rich preſents ſent him out of their common treaſure, the great good liking and contentment, which that Senate receiued by this mariage. And in like manner, all other Princes and Potentates, did largely expreſſe the like affection, and the ſingular good will which they bare him in this publique cauſe of ioy and gladneſſe, as they had done before in the times of his greateſt troubles and daungers: for (as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſaying is) thoſe are the two ſeaſons wherein true amity and friendſhippe doth <q>make ſhew and triall of itſelfe. That which was ſent from the king of <hi>Arragon</hi> was<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> in all and euery part ſo ſingular and magnificall, that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> (as the report go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) would not haue accepted it,</q> if his neareſt and moſt familiar friends, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant prayers and intreaties of the Spaniſh Ambaſſadours, had not vehemently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned him thereunto. In lieu and recompence whereof, after hee had accepted them, he ſent backe vnto the King other preſentes of no leſſe value and eſtimation, as horſes, ſlaues, and other riches and treaſures which he had taken as the ſpoiles of his enemies the Barbarians. In this manner was this great feaſt ſolemnized with no leſſe pompe and magnificence then reputation and renowme. For beſides that alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſpoken of, the tourneys, iuſtes, triumphes, and other ſpectacles of diuerſe ſorts ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing prizes and rewards of excellent value appointed for thoſe that ſhould beſt deſerue them, did ſtir vp the courages of the young gallants on all parts, who ſhewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:13368:136"/>
couetous of glory, and flocking thither to thoſe triumphs, did by their preſence greatly augment the beauty of that aſſembly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mahomet</hi> was not ignoraunt of any of theſe things, nor of the fortifications of <hi>Croy,</hi> and it is thought, that he would willingly haue troubled the ioy of our <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banois,</hi> but being partly retayned with his domeſticall occaſions (as newe king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes commonly doe engender new infirmities and new diſorders) and partly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo being intentiue to the heaping of great ſummes of money, and to the enriching of his treaſures, he was conſtrained for a ſeaſon to forbeare from any ſuch enterpriſe. Notwithſtanding in the middeſt of his threats and menaces (as he was very talkatiue and free of his ſpeeches) he called his mariage the vnhappy and ſhort ioy of that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunat<note place="margin">Saying of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet touching the mariage of Scanderbeg.</note> couple, ſaying: that it ſhould not be long ere he would ſauce their new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments with deadly teares and lamentations.</p>
            <p>One thing there was which <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> had not yet done, and which of a long<note place="margin">The progreſſe of Scanderbeg with his Queen to viſite all his kingdome.</note> time he had no leyſure to put in execution, by reaſon of his continuall lets and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deraunces of the warres: and that was to viſite all the frontiers, townes, and paſſages of his Realme, which at this time he accompliſhed: hauing with him in company his new ſpouſe and a good troupe of horſemen: and he ſpent many daies in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation. In all places where he paſſed, the people by great flockes in a certaine kinde of emulation, did enforce them ſelues euery man according to his degree, to receiue him into their townes with magnificall and royall entertainment: and with a thouſand ſortes of goodly ſhewes and ſpectacles, and or rich preſentes, according to the vttermoſt of their power and abilities, they did gratifie both him and his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe. There was not any one, but was moſt gratiouſly accepted, without any ſhew of diſlike, or any token of diſdaine: all of them were receiued with a chearfull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce and like courteſie, not onely thoſe which came full handed, but euen they alſo, who wanting meanes to ſhew and teſtifie their good willes, did preſent him with their good heartes, and the prodigall bounty of their affections. The King hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on his courſe in this progreſſe, did viſite euery particular place, euen to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Macedony,</hi> and to the very fartheſt limits and borders of his countrey. When he came into the lower <hi>Dibria,</hi> he obſerued one place aboue the reſt, by which the Barbarians had euer vſed and accuſtomed to make their inuaſions vppon <hi>Albanie,</hi> and by ſodaine roades and foragings to waſt and deſtroy at their pleaſures, the goods of the inhabitaunts, and to ſurprize and oppreſſe them at vnawares. For albeit there were many other waies and paſſages into the Prouince, yet this ſame onely was (as it were) the moſt commodious, and on that ſide more then any other, did the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians alſo vſe to inuade and harrie the fieldes and territories of the enemies. In this place therefore he determined (during that litle time of reſt which he enioyed, and whileſt the troubles of armes ceaſed) to depriue the Turkes of this opportunity of annoying of his people, and to prouide for the preſeruation and ſafetie of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes.</p>
            <p>This was a mountaine which they of the countrey call <hi>Modriſſa,</hi> very ragged,<note place="margin">Mountaine of Modriſſa.</note> and of a great height: from the which the frontiers of the Infidels may be very well diſcouered a great waie off. On the toppe of this mountaine, he reſolued to build a fortreſſe, and to fortifie it with good ſtore of ſouldiours, ſuch as being prompt and vigilant, ſhould (by ſhooting off their artillery) aduertiſe the inhabitants at all times of the comming and arriuall of the Turkes: and to the intent alſo that the neare neighbourhood of that Fort ſhould ſerue for a place of refuge vnto his people, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they ſhould be driuen vppon any neceſſity to flie from the enemy: a thing which he had long before conceiued in his thoughts, and many times aſſayed to put
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:13368:136"/>
in execution, but was alwaies compelled to leaue vndone, by reaſon of the daily and continuall troubles of the warres. For this cauſe without making any long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,<note place="margin">Fortreſſe at Modriſſabuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg.</note> and for that him ſelfe would not long dwell in delightes, nor would not haue the harts of his ſoldiers to be corrupted &amp; effeminated, neither to continue drowned in idleneſſe, eaſe, and diſſolution, he returned ſpeedily towards <hi>Croy,</hi> the reparations whereof were by this time brought to good perfection. There did he take vp a good number of Maſons, Carpenters, and moſt part of the workemen and labourers of the city, and about a foure thouſand ſouldiers, to the intent, that if the enemy ſhould go about to diſturbe them, they ſhould finde ſufficient forces to repulſe them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſhould not be able to annoy or hinder them in their worke. With that company he went to <hi>Modriſſa,</hi> where ſetting them in hand with this fort, he followed it ſo diligently, that it was begun and ended without any let or diſturbaunce of the <hi>Mahometans.</hi> For albeit the Turkiſh Monarch were impatient of reuenge, and did at that time labour very diligently to leauy a great and puiſſant army againſt <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> yet being mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the foule diſcomfitures and ouerthrowes formerly receiued by the <hi>Albanois,</hi> and being partly terrified with the rumour of a moſt daungerous warre, intended againſt him by the <hi>Perſians,</hi> ſetting aſide all other matters, and neglecting (as it were) all other occaſion, he bent his whole thoughtes on that ſide to ſee, what would be the end and iſſue of thoſe tumults. For this time therefore did theſe troubles and diſturbances di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the Turkiſh armes from the <hi>Epirots,</hi> and they enioyed yet a while longer the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of the death of <hi>Amurath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the happie ſucceſſe and good fortune of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> and the dayly grieuances of the ſubiectes of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who complained vnto him that they were continually ouer-runne, harried and pilled by the ordinarie roades and incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the <hi>Epirotes,</hi> did not a little trouble and perplexe the <hi>Sultan:</hi> yet at the firſt he did but ſomewhat eaſe his ſtomacke (though in vaine) with many menaces and outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſpeeches againſt <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> being abſent: afterwardes hauing recourſe to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and faire ſpeeches, he aſſayed to treate with him for ſome accord to be had of pacification and peace betweene them. To this ende he ſent ouer an Ambaſſade vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">Ambaſſadours ſent with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of peace by Mahomet to Scanderbeg.</note> 
               <hi>Croy,</hi> offering him to make peace with him, ſo that he would yeeld him ſelfe tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butarie, according to the conditions which <hi>Amurath</hi> had before propounded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Of all this matter, and of the cunning diſſimulation of the <hi>Ottoman,</hi> and of the warre rayſed by the <hi>Perſians,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Albanie</hi> was duely enformed, by the ſecrete intelligence of certaine great and noble men his friendes about <hi>Mahomet.</hi> By meanes whereof, the Ambaſſours being arriued, they were ſoone refuſed, and their demaundes vtterly reiected, returning with this aunſwer for a full reſolution. <q>That hardly could hee be content to accept anie conditions of peace of the tyraunt,<note place="margin">Anſwer of Scanderbeg to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of Mahomet.</note> were they neuer ſo honeſt and tollerable: much leſſe theſe, which were ſo intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and iniurious. That he was entred into <hi>Epire</hi> onely to this ende, to ſhake off his yoake from that Prouince, and to aboliſh, as much as in him lay, the hatefull name of bondage and ſeruitude: and not to impoſe newe griefes vppon them. That this was the onely fruite and benefite which he did reape of his trauelles and hazards ſuſtayned, to ſee his countrey one day freed and deliuered from Turkiſh tyrannie and ſubiection. That if hee had had anie deſire or deuotion to haue amitie and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe with him, hee would then haue yeelded to ſubmit him ſelfe to thoſe termes of ſlauerie and thraldome, when the power and puiſſaunce in a manner of all <hi>Europe</hi> and of <hi>Aſia,</hi> was euen in the verie heart and bowelles of his kingdome: when the bloudie <hi>Amurath</hi> did beard him to his face, and was in armes againſt
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:13368:137"/>
him; and was deſirous to haue had him yeeld to theſe conditions. That it ſhould ſuffiſe them to thinke what they had ſuffered in times paſt, euen to that daye: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce whereof ſhould giue him iuſt cauſe of griefe and ſorrow at all times. That it was not nowe with the <hi>Epirotes</hi> as in times paſt, but that matters were quite chaunged, and the men cleane altered from that they were wont to be: and they had little reaſon to hope to bring them to this point. Well they might do it by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint offorce and open violence: but to thinke by good wordes and entiſing ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to perſwade and inuite them to ſo infamous and baſe an act, they were fouly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken and deceiued.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Ambaſſadour being diſmiſſed with this aunſwer, and his offers being vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">The fortreſſe of Modriſſa fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</note> reiected: <hi>Caſtriot</hi> did altogether apply him ſelfe to his worke lately begunne, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his enemies for a while to take their reſt. By this time was the fortreſſe of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driſſa</hi> in a good forwardneſſe, by reaſon that the lyme, ſtones and other ſtuffe was prepared and made readie for the building long before hand. In leſſe then ſixe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths was it encloſed and compaſſed with walles, and fitted with other edifices and particular houſes and lodgings for the ſouldiers: the ouerplus that remained was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and enlarged afterwardes from time to time. The place being ſure and ſtrong by nature, needed not anie ditches or rampiers to ſtrengthen it: and therefore proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was made onely of men, armes, munition, and other prouiſions. There were brought thither alſo from <hi>Croy,</hi> certaine peeces of great ordinance: which being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to them of the Fort, they were admoniſhed how to vſe them, and to what end: as hath bene before declared.</p>
            <p>Theſe thinges thus done: <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> led the <hi>Albanians</hi> into the enemies coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,<note place="margin">Territories and Dominions of the Turkes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaded &amp; ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg.</note> where finding the places voyde of defence, they made a hand of all that they found, harrying and ſpoyling all things, and not ſparing to afflict the Turkiſh do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions with what ſoeuer miſchiefes and diſcommodities the furie and rage of the warres could poſſibly imagine. From thence ſome of them retired with their Chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine towardes <hi>Croy</hi> loden with prey and bootie: but the better parte was left vppon the frontiers (as had bene euer vſed) in garriſon. For, albeit the raiſing of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe of <hi>Modriſſa</hi> did greatly aſſure and ſafegard the plaine countrey: yet were not the ordinarie forces retired from the frontiers, becauſe the place where they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed was diſtant about foureteene miles or more from <hi>Modriſſa.</hi> Beſides that the ſouldiers of the garriſon were not left for that ende, and to the ſame effect as thoſe of the newe Fortreſſe: but principally for the repulſe of the violence of the Turkes, and to gard the Prouince againſt the incurſions and pillages of the Painims. And if it did happen that the Turkes did come vpon them with ſuch force and puiſſance, as they were not able to make head againſt them, then were they to retire and ſaue them ſelues, either in the toppes and ſafe paſſages of the mountaines, or elſe in the inner partes of the countrey. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> after he was arriued at <hi>Croy,</hi> being deſirous to take the benefite of the time, whileſt the <hi>Sultan</hi> was buſied in other affaires, and by ſome notable act to amplifie the boundes of his Realme, he called together his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and the principall perſons of the citie of <hi>Croy,</hi> with the moſt part of his troupes and companies: and hauing a long time deuiſed with them vpon the proceedings of the warres, and what courſe was beſt to be taken: at the laſt, becauſe he would ſound<note place="margin">Oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg to his ſubiects, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with their conqueſts vpon the Turkes.</note> the intents and meaning of their thoughts, and proue how they were affected, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan thus to ſpeake vnto them.</p>
            <p>Worthie Peeres and braue <hi>Epirotes,</hi> now that we haue ſufficiently filled and gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged our ſelues with feaſting and banquetting, and with all kinde of licentious eaſe
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:13368:137"/>
and libertie: we haue no reaſon anie longer to leaue our armes, and to let our <q>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vertue lye (as it were) a ſleepe and forgotten: we haue kept holy day long enough: we haue feaſted and triumphed ſufficiently for the victorie had againſt <hi>Amurath:</hi> we haue ſpent a whole yeare, partly in recreation, partly in repairing of our townes, or building of newe places, and we haue not ſo much as once viſited the enemie. It is nowe high time to awake, and to giue ſome newe proofe of your wonted valour, euen now whileſt <hi>Mahomet</hi> hath his hands full with the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and that God hath giuen you the meanes and oportunitie, without anie effuſion of bloud to reeſtabliſh the auncient honour and reputation of <hi>Albanie,</hi> and to reuiue thoſe ancient times ſo greatly deſired: whileſt that the enemie his power is nowe ſomewhat weakened and repreſſed, and whileſt he is otherwiſe occupied and entangled in diuerſe weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and tedious troubles,</q> not knowing what to doe, nor what courſe to take: for theſe two, are the onely and principall ſeaſons for the good and happie diſpatch of<q>

This therefore is the time, this is the houre, that inuiteth you to ſeeke out the enemie, and not alwayes to lye ſtill and idle, and to expect when he will come to aſſaile you. Behold howe <hi>Sfetigrade</hi> looketh after you, and calleth for your ayde. Doth the ill ſucceſſe of the laſt yeares ſiege terrifie you? I aſſure you I would be loth to leade you, where I ſhould thinke the miſchiefe to be ſo great, or the perill ſo euident: but no we the great number of your victories, the death of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murath,</hi> the preſent occupation of our aduerſarie, hath greatly diminiſhed theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties: beſides that you ſhall not want ſtore of artillerie, and ſuch like engines and inſtruments of aſſault. The opportunitie of the time, and the countenaunce of the enemie, ſhall inſtruct vs what is further to be done. For my part, I can promiſe you nothing without expence and loſſe of bloud: without vehement and earneſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: of which notwithſtanding, the valiant man, the couragious ſouldier hath ſcarce anie feeling or perſeueraunce: euen then when he is moſt painefully occupied, and in the action: much leſſe will he be afrayed or in doubt of it, before he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to proue the difficulty of it. Yet if <hi>Sfetigrade</hi> be ſo odious and diſpleaſing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, there are other places and fortreſſes of the enemy not farre off, which may recompence your loſſes ſuſtained at <hi>Sfetigrade,</hi> and may content and ſatisfie your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. There is <hi>Belgrade</hi> as neare or nearer then <hi>Sfetigrade,</hi> and not vnworthy nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our trauelles, nor of our bloud, if we haue any deſire either of honour, or of recompence. I haue reaſon (my good companions) to be aſhamed more then any, that I ſhould ſpend one yeare during my raigne amongeſt you idlely and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing, and yet to ſee and ſuffer the houſes of our aunceſters, the townes of our confederates, the noble markes of the eſtate and Empire of the <hi>Albanians,</hi> ſo ſhamefully to be ſubiected and enthralled vnder the Infidelles. Wherefore that this time of ley ſure and opportunity which is left vs, doe not ſlippe out of our handes, let vs follow and imitate the <hi>Perſians:</hi> let vs embrace the good fortune which God ſeemeth to haue offered vs. In ſo doing, we ſhall enlarge our dominions: we ſhall augment our franchiſes and liberties: We ſhall reuenge our loſſes, our grieues, and iniuries: and (which aboue all is to be preferred) we ſhall keepe the youth of our Realme from ſloath and idleneſſe. Neither hath the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor our good friend the king <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> nor ſo many deuout and Catholique Princes, aided and ſuccoured vs with their treaſures and other ſupplies, to the intent we ſhould keepe vs ſtil idle within dores: that we ſhould dwel in pleaſures and delights, &amp; grow corrupted and effeminate: but rather that we ſhould betake our ſelues to armes, and make proofe and triall of our valour in the middeſt of all perils and daungers, and that euen in deſpite of death it ſelfe wee ſhould performe the duety and deuoyre
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:13368:138"/>
of men valiant and couragious, and of moſt braue and reſolute ſouldiers.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This encouragement of the king of <hi>Epire</hi> ſeemed not greatly to like the auditors: for they did not applaude it with a ſudden and vniuerſall crie and conſent (as they were wont:) but with a kinde of muttering noiſe, interrupted (as it were) by times, and by ſtoppes, they did ſignifie ſufficiently, that the mindes of the ſouldiers were not conformable, but rather different from his deſire. Notwithſtanding though there were fewe or none which did commend or allowe of his aduiſe: yet being aſhamed openly to contradict it, they ſtood ſtill one looking vpon another: and none of them durſt open his mouth to reply vnto him, for feare of being noted for a greater coward or more daſtardly minded then the reſt of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions. Then <hi>Vranocontes</hi> ſeeing all of them ſo ſtil and ſilent, ariſing out of his ſeate, &amp; addreſſing his ſpeech to <hi>Scanderbeg:</hi> 
               <q>It is not (quoth he) moſt prouident and prudent Prince, either timerouſneſſe or want<note place="margin">Anſwer of Vranocontes to the oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Sca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derbeg: in the name of all the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rots.</note> of courage, or the experience of our late ſucceſſe at <hi>Sfetigrade</hi> which cauſeth vs at this time with bluſhing cheekes to diſallow and diſlikethy counſell: but (giue me leaue to be the firſt who may freely confeſſe vnto thee the cauſe of this our backwardneſſe): it is the time and ſeaſon of the yeare, wherein ordinarily conſiſteth the beſt part of mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie ſeruices: it is I ſay, the time onely which doth aduiſe &amp; admoniſh vs not to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto thee. Thou ſeeſt that the Autumne is now well neare ſpent, ſcarcely ſhall we be able to leuie any forces, ſcarcely ſhall we put in order other things requiſite for the ſiege, and we ſhall hardly make our approches to the walles, but that the vnſeaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe<note place="margin">Winter wars moſt diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious and hurtfull.</note> of the winter will aſſault vs with infinit inconueniences &amp; diſcommodities, both the heauens and the earth wil make warre againſt vs, the ſhowers &amp; raine continually falling, the froſts, Ice and ſnow, will both hinder, offend, and encomber our ſouldiers, and will defend and protect the enemie. For as this ſeaſon is of it ſelfe vnfit &amp; diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for all occaſions: ſo is it moſt contrary, and to the ſingular diſaduantage of thoſe that come to be encamped, and lye at the ſiege of townes. And there is great ods and inequalitie betweene the dammages and inconueniences which it bringeth to the beſiegers, in regard of thoſe annoyances which it layeth vpon the beſieged. For theſe being retired within their walles, and vnder the ſuccour and couert of their baſtils and defences, will be able with pleaſure to affront vs, and hauing abundance of all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, they may (as it were) with the one hand hold their weapons and armes readie to defend them ſclues, whileſt with the other they do repaire and renue their forces &amp; their rampiets. And what ſhall we do the whileſt? Onely we haue the aduantage of our corages prodigall &amp; careleſſe of our owne ſafeties, and obſtinately addicted to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile &amp; force the enemy. For to ſpeake of any artillery, it is not vnknown vnto vs, both at the ſiege of <hi>Sfetigrade,</hi> and at other places, how litle good it doth and will do, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in this vnſeaſonable time of winter, and againſt places ſo defencible &amp; ſtrong by nature, ſeated vpon rocks &amp; mountaines which are vnbatterable &amp; impregnable.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therfore, that it behoueth vs with all our power and endeuors to ſhun &amp; auoyd theſe vaine attempts, and this wilful loſſe and deſtruction of our ſouldiers: and it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth<note place="margin">Sentence.

Touching the warre of the <hi>Perſians</hi> (if I may ſpeake what I thinke of it) for my part I do repoſe little or no truſt therein at this time: for either wil the report of all thoſe skirmiſhes and commotions vaniſh away to ſmoke and come to nothing: or elſe it is like that the <hi>Perſians</hi> will deferre and put off their armes till ſome other time of better oportunitie. All this notwithſtanding (moſt valiaunt Prince the mirrour of magnanimitie) we will not hinder thy determinations; but if thou doeſt thinke,

that thine owne opinion and conceipt in this point, be more for the benefite and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of the Eſtate, and for the publike and common reputation, we will march on with a good will, and will cheerefully follow thy enſignes, whereſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe thee to leade vs: we will frame and fit our tongues and our ſpeeches, our handes and our actions, yea the very times and ſeaſons to ſerue onely at thy good will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and as it ſhall ſeeme good vnto thee.

            <p>
               <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> perceiuing how his ſubiects were affected, and the rather for that they ſpake nothing but what was true and certaine, he ſuffered himſelfe ſoone and eaſily to be perſwaded by them, according to that curteſie &amp; bountie of his good nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he did euer draw the affections of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munalty to loue &amp; honor him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Counſell being broken vp, the aſſembly diſmiſſed, &amp; the ſouldiers licenſed to<note place="margin">Donique the wife of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg paſſeth the Sommer at Petralba.</note> depart, he permitted euery man to retire to his owne home. At the beginning of the ſommer he had left the Queene at <hi>Petralba,</hi> as afterwards alſo in the ſame ſeaſon of the yere he vſed alwayes during his life to do the like: to thintent that during the extreme heate of ſommer, &amp; till the end of Autumne, ſhe might remaine there for her more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace and recreation: &amp; the reſt of the yere ſhe vſually ſpent at <hi>Croy,</hi> except it were at ſuch times as the Turks came into <hi>Epire,</hi> or that the country was troubled with any immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate forces, &amp; extraordinary puiſſance of the enemy. For then when it ſtood vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<note place="margin">Colchina a citie of the Venetia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vpon the ſea or gulfe of Venice in Dalmatia.</note> hazard of his whole eſtate, he tranſported her with all her houſhold, &amp; the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious things of all her furniture and moueables vnto <hi>Colchina</hi> a ſea towne of the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> or to ſome other ſuch like place farre remoued and out of the way. Now that he hadde diſmiſſed his army, he him ſelfe with <hi>Ameſe,</hi> and very ſmall traine, went to the Queene to <hi>Petralba.</hi> Vnder this caſtell was a plaine of ſinguler beauty and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note place="margin">Deſcription of the conntrey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Petralba.</note> pleaſaunt, both for the admirable recreation which the very nature of the place did affoorde, as alſo by reaſon of the notable diligence of the inhabitants, who had bene very curious and induſtrious in trimming and husbanding of the ſoile. For it wanted not any fruites, vines, plants, or trees, nor any thing in the world which might ſeeme either to adorne and beautifie the countrey, or to make it bleſſed and happy. In this place during that quarter of the yeare did the Queene make her abode, accompanied with her Ladies, maides, and officers. On all ſides was the plaine enuironned with wood and thickets, and with many narrow ſtraights and vallies in a manner vnacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: amongſt the which <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> held continuall watch and ward, keeping a great number of ſouldiers to guard and defend the place: which was alſo ſingularly well prouided and furniſhed, with armes, men, victuals, &amp; other munitions for all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences and accidents of Fortune whatſoeuer Hauing made but ſmall ſtay at <hi>Petral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi> he remoued with his Queene backe againe to <hi>Croy,</hi> where alſo he had no long reſt. For (as <hi>Vranocontes</hi> moſt ſagely and wiſely had prognoſticated) newes came within a while, and the report encreaſed daily: that the Perſian was retired, the tumults of that war appeaſed, and all ſturs and commotions pacified: and that the Turkiſh Monarch being freed from this feare, did minde to bend his forces againſt the <hi>Albanians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> was greatly troubled with theſe tidings, neuertheleſſe he told his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes<note place="margin">Mahomet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt Scanderbeg.

with their Targets, did firſt kill and ouerthrow their horſes, and then all at pleaſure had their willes of the riders: manie of whom perceiuing this ſtrange and vnaccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed kinde of daunger, diſmounted from their horſes, and eyther fought on foote, or ſought to ſaue themſelues by retyring into the valley towardes their compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to reſerue themſelues to a more ſure exploit, and to a ſafer kinde of ſeruice. <hi>Ameſe</hi> the Chriſtian, being accompanied with a ſtrong and mightie troupe of horſe was ſent by his Vncle to the other ſide of the mountaine, where the deſcent was more facile and eaſie: and there beganne an other fight in the ſtreightes and moſt narrowe paſſages of the valley.

On the one ſide where the way ſeemed more free and open for the enemie, <hi>Caſtroit</hi> did fiercely preſſe vppon them cloſe at their backes: on the other ſide <hi>Ameſe</hi> the Chriſtian had ſhut in, and (as it were) beſieged <hi>Ameſe</hi> the Turkiſh Generall, who (ſeeing not anie likelihoode<note place="margin">Ameſe Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the Turkes, taken priſoner by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſe the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg.</note> nor apparance either of victorie or of ſafetie) was oftentimes importuned and vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the <hi>Albanois</hi> to render himſelfe: which at length to his great griefe, he was contented to yeeld vnto: and laying aſide his armes, he gaue him his faith to be true priſoner.

For it was a common ſpeech and talke amongſt them, that God had now giuen them a manifeſt ſigne &amp; pledge of their good fortune, and that they ſhold preuaile as well againſt the new Monarch, as againſt his predeceſſour: alſo that they were aſſured vnder the conduct of their Prince, to haue like fortune &amp; good happe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſonne, as they had of late againſt the father.

            <p>During the ſolemnitie of this publique triumph and feaſting, both in reſpect of the time which was feſtiuall, and of their affaires, which had ſucceeded ſo fortunate, <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:13368:140"/>
commaunded the priſoners to be enlarged, and that <hi>Ameſe</hi> ſhould be brought vnto him: whom after he had welcommed and receiued with great humanitie, he honored &amp; feaſted moſt magnificently, to the intent he ſhould be pertaker of their ioy and triumph for that victorie, whereof himſelfe had partly bene the giuer and the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. But firſt of all, the <hi>Mahometan</hi> did requeſt him, that he would vouchſafe to licenſe ſome one of the captiues to go to <hi>Andrinople,</hi> and to aduertiſe his friends of his eſtate and condition, and to bring his ranſome. For it may be (ſaid he) that they which are eſcaped from the ſlaughter, doe know nothing of my misfortune and aduenture: but may thinke me to be ſlaine amongſt the reſt. This being accorded as he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the price of all their ranſomes being concluded and agreed vpon at 13000. crownes: two of them were preſently diſpatched and ſent away to deale for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie of their companions, and they were accompanied with one of the Chriſtians, till ſuch time as he had conducted them ſafe out of the countrie.

            <p>Whileſt that matters ſtood vppon theſe tearmes, the newes of this diſcomfiture<note place="margin">1452.</note> was come to the eares of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who ſeeing the reliques of his army without a Generall, without enſignes, &amp; without armes, I leaue it to you to be imagined, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſight therof did not procure griefe and ſorrow both in publique &amp; in priuate. The <hi>Sultan</hi> did enquire particularly of the encounter, &amp; he was deſirous to heare the diſcourſe of the whole manner and order of the fight: which being told him, though he were euen enraged for pure deſpite and anger, yet he fell from the conceipt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of that misfortune, to feaſting, reuelling and banquetting, ſtriuing &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing himſelfe to the vttermoſt of his power, to obſcure the praiſe and deſerts of the <hi>Albanois,</hi> and to colour, excuſe, &amp; hide his own misfortune.

For re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing to himſelfe very little or nothing of that which was giuen him, he gaue it in common, and parted it both amongeſt friendes and welwillers, and to thoſe that were partners with him in his perils. Their ranſomes being thus paied, the Turkes
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:13368:140"/>
were licenſed to depart at their pleaſures. <hi>Ameſe</hi> was very ſorie to leaue the King of <hi>Albanie,</hi> and (the ſaying is) that before his departure, he did a long while, in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret<note place="margin">Ameſe and the other Turkes priſoners ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſommed.</note> deuiſe with <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> vpon the nature and diſpoſition of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and of the manner of maintayning the warre againſt him. At their going thence there were manie preſents beſtowed vpon them, and victuals prouided to ſerue them for manie dayes, beſides a good conuoy, which did bring them ſafe and ſound into their owne limits and confines.</p>
            <p>Before ſuch time as <hi>Ameſe</hi> arriued at <hi>Andrinople,</hi> there was begunne to be made<note place="margin">Debreas ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed with a new armie againſt Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg.</note> a newe leauie of other forces, and the old companies were ſupplyed with freſh men in the place of thoſe which were loſt. He that had the leading of them was named <hi>Debreas,</hi> a man of notable courage, and one that by his experience and long practiſe in armes, had attained to the degree &amp; dignitie of a <hi>Saniacke.</hi> But he had laboured too ambitiouſly with the <hi>Ottoman</hi> to grant him this commiſſion, enforcing himſelf with<note place="margin">Debreas his ambition and glorious oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> manie glorious promiſes to animate the <hi>Sultan</hi> more &amp; more, and to put him in a full hope and perſwaſion of an aſſured victorie. For he referred all things to the conceipt of his owne wit, and to the ſufficiencie of his owne wiſedome, attributing little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vnto fortune, notwithſtanding that ſhe doth beare a great ſtroke in all humaine actions, and eſpecially in deedes of armes. Neuertheleſſe he promiſed the <hi>Sultan</hi> not to hazard all his forces at one blow, nor to commit them to the aduenture of one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire battell, but that he would by ſome good entry and beginning make himſelfe way to an aſſured victorie. Beſides, he tooke no great care nor was deſirous of any greater forces, then ſuch as <hi>Ameſe</hi> his predeceſſor had lately had before him: induced thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to through a kind of emulation &amp; deſire of glory: to the intent it might be ſaid, that he had reeſtabliſhed the good fortune of the Turkiſh Empire with the like numbers, &amp; (as it were) with the ſame ſouldiers. As it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly ſeene, that the man which is<q>
                  <note place="margin">Sentence.</note> hardie and reſolute thinketh nothing impoſſible whereunto his mind is affectioned.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now was not <hi>Debreas</hi> the onely man that had thus deſired to be employed by the <hi>Sultan,</hi> but there were many others, who of themſelues and their owne motion, did ſue to haue the honour of that difficult and hard ſeruice: for by how much the more<note place="margin">Ambition and enuie of the Turkes againſt Scanderbeg.</note> the name of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> did growe glorious amongſt the Barbarians, and the greater report and renowme that ranne of his inuincible fortune: ſo much the greater was the reſort and concourſe of all ſuch as thought any thing well of their owne valure and worthineſſe: eche of them greedily deſiring to haue the credite of that iourney, as men that did affect and aſpire to the greateſt offices and higheſt dignities. Beſides, the ambition of theſe men was much augmented and pricked forward by the libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the Turkiſh Monarche publiſhed and ſpread abroad, who had lately proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and decreed a wonderfull great rewarde and recompence to him that could van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh the <hi>Albanois.</hi> But after that <hi>Ameſe</hi> vppon his returne was ſeene and heard to<note place="margin">Ameſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the vertue of Scanderbeg diſcourageth the Turkes.</note> vtter his opinion and conceit of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> and his fortune, thoſe their haughtie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires were much chaunged and abated. For by a continuall, yet true commendation, he did ſo extoll the vertue of the Chriſtian Prince and his companies, as it little wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but that <hi>Debreas</hi> had chaunged his opinion, and that the <hi>Sultan</hi> had not broken the voyage. Neuertheleſſe becauſe he would not derogate from the maieſtie of his Empire, he thought it better to encreaſe and ſtrenthen his armie, then either to miſtruſt the diligence and deuoire of his <hi>Saniacke,</hi> before he had made proofe and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of him: or to leaue the diſcomfiture of <hi>Ameſe,</hi> and the late iniuries of his people vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuenged. Wherefore there was added to the troupes before leauied a new ſupply of 3000. horſe. Thus whileſt that <hi>Ameſe</hi> diſcharging the dutie of a friend, and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his late hoaſt, did exalt the honour of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> and did publiſh his rare ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:13368:141"/>
he was in a manner iniurious vnto him, or rather he was the author and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner of his greater praiſe and of his more honorable victorie.</p>
            <p>All things being in a readineſſe, and the companies readie to march, there fell ſuch great ſtore of raine, continuing for many dayes together, that it did for a while hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<note place="margin">Debreas mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre with an armie of 15000. men.</note> the forwardneſſe of the ſouldiers. Put the foule weather being ceaſed, and the ſeaſon of the yeare being likewiſe growen more milde and pleaſant, by the comming on of the ſpring, they tooke their iourney with all ſpeede and celeritie: the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and conſideration drew <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> likewiſe into his campe, there to deliberate with his Chieftaines, and to prouide for the ordering of his affaires, which the rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the winter had cauſed him to deferre and put off, till the time fell out more fit and gratious to his purpoſe. This was the occaſion, that at the ſame time when both the preparations, and the comming of the enemy were noyſed in the countrie, he was<note place="margin">Scanderbeg leauteth an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of 7000. men againſt Debreas.</note> with <hi>Moſes</hi> amongſt the <hi>Dibrians,</hi> wherefore he aſſembled ſpeedily, and in a ſmall time to the number of 7000. men or ſomewhat more.</p>
            <p>It ought not to ſeeme ſtrange, neither ſhould any man maruell, that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were ſo ſuddenly and readily armed and prouided, nor that they gathered an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie<note place="margin">The order ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg for the ſudden arming of his ſubiects and ſpeedie raiſing of an armie.</note> with ſuch incredible ſpeede and celeritie. For the King of <hi>Epyre</hi> of his owne meere and proper motion, without the deſert or merit of any mans ſeruice, had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the better part of his ordinarie reuenues, eſpecially of his demaines, to certaine of the greateſt and chiefeſt men of the countrie, vppon condition, that whenſoeuer there happened any neceſſitie of warre, they ſhould preſently find him a certaine num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men at their coſtes and charges, according to ech mans ſtate and qualitie: with whom, themſelues alſo in perſon ſhould make their ſpeedie repayre vnto him, and ſo to receiue ſuch directions, and to be employed in ſuch ſeruices, as it ſhould pleaſe him to commaund and appoint. Theſe men therefore were alwaies readie in armes, and well appointed, expecting nothing but the will and pleaſure of their Chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. Beſides there was a certaine number of the inhabitants, and eſpecially of the husbandmen, who by a certaine vſage and cuſtome of the countrie, were bound to accompanie them whereſoeuer they marched without anie conſideration of pay or wages: and commonly, the onely deſire of prey and pillage did furniſh him with more men then he him ſelfe would haue demaunded. Hereof it appeareth, howe <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> could continually repayre ſo manie and ſo often armies, conſidering that his rents and cuſtomes were not ſo great, nor were not ſufficient for anie long time to entertaine his ſouldiers. Adde herewithall, that if neither the cuſtome of the countrie, nor their greedie deſire of prey, had not been ſuch as it was, yet the regarde of the common perill, the conſideration of their Prince his dexteritie and good fortune, might eaſily haue allured and perſwaded them, and was ſufficient to haue drawen them into armes. As for the ſtipendarie ſuccours and mercenarie ſouldiers which he hyred for his money, the chiefe burthen and importance of that charge, was borne for the moſt part by the Biſhoppes of <hi>Rome,</hi> the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and other Catholique Chriſtian Princes, who fayled not from time to time to furniſh him with money and treaſure, which (as the ſaying is) are the ſynewes of the warres.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Debreas</hi> hauing paſſed ouer the greateſt part of <hi>Bulgarie,</hi> or the countrie of the <hi>Tryballians,</hi> was gotten as farre as <hi>Pologue,</hi> which is a place and part of <hi>Bulgarie,</hi>

They were no ſooner departed from <hi>Mocrea,</hi> and ſcarce entred within the plaine, but the heauens were ſuddenly chaunged euen in an inſtant: and at the firſt there fell a ſweete ſhower, which did but gently wet the battallions, but the<note place="margin">Army of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg ſtriken with feare by the terror of a ſudden tempeſt</note> raine encreaſing by litle and litle, there followed a great tempeſt of thunder and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with a mightie ſtorme and violent windes. Hereupon did the Enſignes make a ſtande, and a certaine horror and feare beganne to poſſeſſe the companies: in ſuch ſort, that they ſtoode gazing one vppon another verie ſad and penſiue, as if ſome ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter token and preſage of ill fortune had befallen them. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> making but a ieſt of this their timerouſneſſe and vaine feare, went to the head of the battell and puſhed forward the Standard-bearer with his hand, telling him, that he was but an ill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoſticator vnto himſelfe: and he ſaide with a loud voice: that it behoued them <q>vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">Speech of Scanderbeg to his ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed at the tempeſt.</note> ſuch an opportunitie to take the aduantage of the time, and to charge the enemie: that this was no other but the caſualtie and inconſtancie of the ſpring time, and new ſeaſon of the yeare, namely of the moneth of March: and that before they ſhould be able to come to handie-ſtroakes with the enemie, they ſhould ſee the ayre would waxe cleare, and as calme and pleaſant as before. Whereupon the ſouldiers being recomforted,</q> and interpreting it to be a ſigne of their owne good fortune, they did both mutually encourage one another, and they put their leaders likewiſe in a better hope and comfort. By this time the weather being cleared (as <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolde) the brightneſſe of the moone-light encreaſing with her courſe, and the neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their troupes did now diſcouer the approach of the <hi>Albanois,</hi> which haſtened on eche mans fortune eyther good or bad. The enemie at the firſt being aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and vnreſolued, ſtoode a while in ſuſpence, whether they ſhould fight, or flie: or whether it were beſt to temporize. The darkeneſſe of the night did much augment their terrour, and the audacitie of the Chriſtians whom they ſawe to be aduaunced ſo farre without their confines and from their owne dwellings. On the contrarie, this ſeemed to encourage them, and to encreaſe their hardineſſe, in that they knewe they were to fight not in the enemies countrie where they might be in feare of ambuſhments and ſurpriſes. But the principall point that made them to caſt awaie all feare, was the multitude and valure of their troupes, which was enough euen to make the verieſt cowards to be aſhamed to thinke of flight. Wherefore in the ende <hi>Debreas</hi> giuing a ſigne to beginne the fight, willed them to goe to the charge, and calling to minde his owne great and large promiſes made to the <hi>Ottoman,</hi> and the inſtructions giuen him, he animated his ſouldiers, and courſing vppe and downe nowe here now there, thus did he incenſe and egge them on more fiercely againſt the enemie.</p>

And he had this reaſon eſpecially, for that the ſmaller number being once diſordered, might eaſily be forced and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen by the greater. And becauſe he durſt not relie too much vpon the ſtrength of thoſe looſe troupes which he had made out to encounter and to beginne the fight with the Barbarians: he cauſed <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Ameſe</hi> with a ſtrong ſquadron of choſen men, to make head againſt the enemie which was comming to giue the onſet vpon him: doubting leaſt if at the beginning of the battell they in the forefront ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen

to be repulſed, both his owne people might be the more troubled and terrified, and the enemie the better hartened and encouraged. As for the reſt of his ſquadrons, he kept them cloſe and excellently well ordered in great ſilence. In like caſe, the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell either doubting the obscuritie of the night, or conforming his counſels to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and demeanour of the Chriſtians, ſtirred not at all: but with his battell cloſe arraunged and in good array, he held himſelfe quiet as a beholder of the fight. Thus the conflict betweene the vauntcurrours on the one ſide and the other did ſeeme to repreſent (as it were) a pleaſant combat: and the two armies on both partes did care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attend in great doubt the euent and hazard of the battell, which it behoued them ſhortly to vndertake. But the <hi>Dibrian</hi> did ſoone cut off this ſpectacle and their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for like a violent ſtorme ruſhing in vpon the middeſt of them that fought, with<note place="margin">Moſes putteth to flight the Turkes that began the flight.</note> the deſtruction and ſlaughter of a great many, he did eaſily put the reſt to flight, and with the exceeding vehemencie of his furie, hauing forgotten himſelfe, he had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt purſued them euen into the middeſt of their maine battallion, if that <hi>Ameſe</hi> calling backe his ſouldiers had not refrayned his furie, and with good words as well as deedes had not cauſed him to retire their enſignes.</p>
            <p>Certaine it is and not to be denied: that <hi>Moſes</hi> was a braue man, hardie and valiant<note place="margin">Moſes his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate fury in the heat of fight.</note> of his perſon, and a moſt excellent Captaine fit to haue the commaund of any forces: yet when he was once embrued with the blood of his enemies, and that (as the ſaying is) his blood was once hot: his impatiencie did ſo maſter him, that he was not able<q>

Wherefore it is reported that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> did ſharply reprehend him: admoniſhing him to temper his hardineſſe and audacitie with more moderation and modeſtie, and to vſe his victorie more aduiſedly: that well it might be tolerable in a priuate ſouldier to be ſo audacious and hardie: but in a leader which hath the charge and commaund of men, it is a fault no leſſe pernitious then reproueable, and a very bad preſident and ill enſample.</q>

            <p>The reſt of the troupes Albanois ſtood a while at a ſtay, and without mouing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their forward or backward, admiring the extreme hardines of the Chieftaine. But on the contrary, the enemies were ſtriken with an exceeding feare, and began thereupon to conceiue a certaine and generall reſolution to fly away, and to leaue fighting: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding thinking that the Chriſtians by reaſon of the darkneſſe of the night would not ſtirre any farther, nor enterprize any thing, but deferre the maine fight till the break of the day, they ſtirred not at all, but held good &amp; ſtood firme for a while, &amp; the rather for that beſides the ſhame and ignominie, they iudged that their flight in the vncertaintie of the darke would be farre more perilous and full of hazard. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Albanois was not a little perplexed in his thoughts, but had diuerſe imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations in his minde: being in doubt whether he ſhould attend the day-light or elſe ſhould preſſe forward this his good fortune, which to men of warre, is very light and

inconſtant. For herein he found him ſelfe deceiued of his hope, in that he thought to haue ſurprized them at vnwares, and found them out of order, as he had of late ouerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the <hi>Amezans:</hi> &amp; yet for all that, ſeeing he had ouerthrown and beaten backe their firſt troupes, he was in hope that they would not abide him but be gone, and ſo pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing them at their backes, he might obtaine the victorie without any loſſe or blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed of his owne men. Now therefore when he perceiued them to ſet a good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance on the matter, and yet neuertheleſſe to be (as it were) in a mammering, and readie to turne their backs: without any more delay, he ſounded a charge &amp; gaue the onſet vpon them moſt furiouſly both before and behind: ſaying vnto his ſouldiers.<note place="margin">Speech of Scanderbeg encouraging his ſouldiers to giue the charge vpon Debreas.</note>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Debreas</hi> his troups endured the ſhocke at the firſt verie coldly: which made him to repaire to their fore ranckes, where he animated &amp; exhorted them to behaue them ſelues manfully and to ſtand firme both with good words, and by the example of his owne vertue and valour: inſomuch that now they began to receiue the Chriſtians to the encounter with a good reſolution, &amp; made them to hold bridle, &amp; ſtopped them in their pace. But whileſt they were thus combatting together, and that ech of the armies were in doubt to be confounded and entangled one within another, the fight as yet was not verie mortall, till ſuch time as one of the <hi>Muſaches</hi> was ſent with part of the horſemen from the left wing to charge the enemie vpon that ſide, where firſt of all their rankes beganne to breake and be diſordered. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> preſſing continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally vpon them in the forefront, did beate vp and downe the preſſe hauing a vehement deſire to encounter with the Generall of the Turkes, and he had enioyned ſome of<note place="margin">Policie of Scan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derbeg in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell to ayme at the deſtruction of the Generall of his enemies.

            </p>
            <p>But the braue and ſudden charge giuen by <hi>Muſache,</hi> did ſomewhat hinder the purpoſe of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> for that <hi>Debreas</hi> leauing the head of the battell where he as then kept, did ſuddenly make towardes that ſide: that repulſing the enemie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing the rankes againe in good order which <hi>Muſache</hi> had diſordered, he might cauſe them to temporize yet a while, and to beare off the violence of their enemies, till ſuch time as it grew to be day. The ſouldiers in the vauntgard no ſooner percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their Generall to be abſent, but they beganne preſently to waxe more faint and flacke in fighting, ſuffering themſelues with little violence to be beaten backe euen into the middeſt of their other battallions. <hi>Moſes,</hi> to the intent he might winne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by ſo glorious an action, brake in verie furiouſly amongſt the thickeſt of them,<note place="margin">A hardie act of Moſes.</note> and ſnatching an Enſigne out of the handes of one of the Barbarians, he throwe it to his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions that followed him. This accident made them to redouble their fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt the enemie, and did with a kinde of iealouzie ſo incenſe and ſet ſpurres to their courages, that they came trouping thither on all ſides as men that brauely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed all daunger, and feare of death. Then beganne the ſlaughter and chiefeſt feare amongſt the Infidels: then might you haue ſeene many a <hi>Moſes:</hi> then might you haue ſeene how the Turkes by heapes and companies forſooke and loſt their Standardes:
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:13368:143"/>
There was no more queſtion or contention who ſhould keepe the fielde: but euerie man thought it beſt to ſhift for himſelfe by running away. The miſfortune that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>Debreas</hi> made him forgetfull of all good diſcipline and martiall order, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued him of all good counſell. For without all delay (as a man diſtracted with furie and feare) he came poaſting thitherwards: where, as he was carefully buſied in rally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his ſquadrons, and ſeeking to renue the battell: <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> who had euer ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried an eye towardes him, came vpon him, and with his launce in the reſt charged him, and with the point thereof ran him cleane through a litle aboue the breſt euen<note place="margin">Debreas ſlaine by Scanderbeg.</note> vnder the chinne: and he endeuoring to auoide the blowe by bending aſide his head, receiued the ſtaffe wholly into his bodie: and he made an end both of his life and of this battell. Being fallen from his horſe his people couered him with their bodies, as long as they thought him to be liuing, ſtill looking that he ſhould remount againe to horſebacke: but perceiuing his bodie lie dead without a ſoule, and that there was not now any man left which could vpbraid them for flying away: they turned bridle immediately, and abandoned ſpeedily both their ſtandardes, their cariages, their<note place="margin">Victorie of Scanderbeg againſt the armie of Debreas.</note> companions and their enemies: and they held him to be moſt accurſed, that in flying was the hindermoſt. Thoſe ſouldiours that ſerued vnder <hi>Ameſe</hi> in the laſt iorney at <hi>Modriſſa,</hi> hauing ſtill in mind that aduenture, as they fought verie warily and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of their liues: ſo were they the foremoſt and moſt fortunate in their flight: the which being made more certaine by reaſon of the day-light, ſo was it the more cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell and cauſed the greater bloodſhed and ſlaughter. For <hi>Muſache</hi> on the one ſide, and <hi>Moſes</hi> on the other purſuing and preſſing cloſe vpon them at their heeles, did kill and cut off more of them in the chaſe, then were ſlaine in the field during the fight: and ſome of them alſo were taken aliue. Much more large and ample no doubt had this victorie bene, at leaſt in reſpect of them which were wounded, if the Chriſtians had bene ſeconded with any Archers or Harguebuzziers: but more then their launces, targets, and courtlaxes they had no other weapons to vſe vpon the enemie. At the length when they were gotten a good way within the Turkiſh confines, and that the chaſe now ſeemed to be more dangerous to them that followed, then to thoſe which<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> fled, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> left purſuing of them, and gathered together his troupes, who were maruellouſly glad and ioyfull: and ſo he retired with his priſoners without any loſſe<note place="margin">Number of Turkes ſtaine in the battell of Pologue Victory not bought but giuen to the Chriſtians.</note> or dammage, hauing not any one of his men either ſlaine or wounded. Thus you ſee by the ſtrange ſucceſſe of this battell, how fortune diſpoſeth of the purpoſes of men, and doth ſometimes fauour them beyond all reaſon and conſideration. The Turkes loſt 4120 men: and therefore the Chriſtians might well ſay (as they might vſually) that this victorie was not bought but giuen.</p>
            <p>The bootie by order of the Prince, being brought forth in the common and open ſight of them all was equally deuided amongeſt the ſouldiers: to the intent that they which had continued the furie of the fight, by following the chaſe vpon the enemie,<note place="margin">Debreas his horſe and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour giuen to Moſes by Scan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derbeg in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his valure &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</note> without any care of ſacking their campe, or ſpoiling of the dead, might not ſuſtaine any loſſe or diſaduantage. To <hi>Moſes</hi> he gaue with his owne hand the horſe and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of <hi>Debreas,</hi> with an honourable teſtimonie likewiſe of his great deſertes and commendations. As for the reſt, euerie one had a ſhare, and fared the better for this iorney, and ſome of them had priſoners giuen vnto them. Amongſt others, <hi>Muſache</hi> his fortune was, to haue a yong Turke to his priſoner, whoſe phyſiognomy and good countenance ſhewed him to be both of nobilitie and of courage. But betweene the maſter and the priſoner, there aroſe forthwith a pleaſant controuerſie, which gaue occaſion of laughter to all the ſtanders by, and I will impart the ſame vnto you. The young man hauing ſome ſpeech with <hi>Muſache</hi> concerning his ranſome, demaunded
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:13368:144"/>
of him, what ſumme would content him: in the end they agreed vpon 200. crownes,<note place="margin">A pleaſaunt queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Muſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che and a Turke his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner.</note> which the Turke preſently taking out of a litle bagge payed, and told out vnto him: and afterwardes deſiring leaue to depart, the Epirot began to ſmile: telling him, that he muſt ſeeke elſewhere for ſome other money to make vp his ranſome: that it was no reaſon he ſhould thinke to pay him with his owne money: that all that coine, and what elſe ſoeuer was taken with him, did of right belong vnto him, and was in one and the ſame caſe and condition with his bodie, and that a priſoner taken in the war, could not reſerue nor chalenge any thing as his owne. The Turke ſometimes with reaſons, and ſometimes with entreatie deſired him to let him goe. But (to make ſhort) the matter was brought before <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> who purpoſely commanded both the one and the other of them to alledge what they could in defence of their right: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards turning him to his people, he vſed theſe wordes.</p>
            <p>Truely (ſaid he) here is a pretie controuerſie, both of theſe plead for that which<note place="margin">Speech of Scanderbeg deciding a controuerſie betweene Muſache &amp; the Turke his priſoner</note>

            <p>Thus this young Turke being verie glad and exceeding ioyfull, that he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his libertie: and hauing alſo both his horſe and his armes franckly giuen him by <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> departed, highly commending without ceaſing, this his bountie and liberalitie, praying vnto God hartily to proſper both the King and the eſtate of <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.</hi> The Chriſtians truſſing vp their baggage, towardes the euening did retire thence <q>into <hi>Dibria,</hi> where during the time of their aboad, (as it is commonly ſeene that when any enterpriſe ſucceedeth happily vnto men, it lifteth vp their minds to affect<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> greater matters,)</q> the <hi>Albanois</hi> beganne to make a motion in a generall councell tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their proceeding in the warres, and for the aſſaulting and winning of ſome townes from the enemie. But in the end it was concluded for the beſt and moſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, that they ſhould ſtay a while to ſee what the Turkiſh Monarch would do after this diſcomfiture of his forces, leaſt they ſhould happen incontinently to vndertake an action, either with too much haſtineſſe &amp; temeritie, or more dangerous then would eaſily be effected. Two monethes therefore were limitted for the diſcouering of that matter, and there were eſpials diſperſed throughout all partes: notwithſtanding that there was no want of fugitiues both from <hi>Andrinople</hi> and other places, which came daily to yeelde themſelues to the <hi>Albanois.</hi> Theſe things thus paſſed, <hi>Moſes</hi> retyred himſelfe to his garriſon vpon the frontiers: and <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> with <hi>Ameſe</hi> and the reſt of his Princes and Nobles, tooke his iourney towards <hi>Croy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this meane time, the army of the Barbarians which had bene broken and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen,<note place="margin">Mahomet and his Nobles greatly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and vexed at the diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiture of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breas.</note> was returned and come to the preſence of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who though he ſaw them in a moſt miſerable plight, and diſtreſſed in all reſpects, yet tooke no pittie nor compaſſion of their eſtate. For firſt of all, both the <hi>Sultan</hi> and all the great perſons of his Court, were greatly troubled and agreeued at the flight of ſo many ſufficient and able men, ſaying openly and aloud, that they were people enough to haue reſtored
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:13368:144"/>
the fortune of any battell, had it bene neuer ſo deſperate and out of hope. Afterwards, when as the great Turke came to enquire of the particulars, where and in what place the battell had bene fought, and againſt what troupes and numbers of the enemie: then was he much more enflamed with rage and choller then before, commaunding them out of his ſight, reproaching and blaming them vnceſſantly, and exclaming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt and deteſting their faintneſſe, ſloth, and cowardice. Moreouer, the miſfortune and miſhappe of <hi>Debreas</hi> cauſed thoſe of his condition and calling, rather to be glad then to grieue thereat: were it either becauſe they did enuie the reputation of his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and vertue: or that they did hate his audacious preſumption. <hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelfe was exceedingly abaſhed at the ſucceſſe of this miracle, and was not altogether free and exempted from feare. He could not be perſwaded that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> with ſo ſmall a companie, durſt enterprize to enter ſo farre vpon his frontiers, and euen in the open plaines of <hi>Pologue</hi> to encounter with <hi>Debreas.</hi> Notwithſtanding finding that their teſtimonies did agree in all parts, and that there was no difference nor diſagreement in their tales; he durſt not call in queſtion the truth of their reportes. Touching the principall point, which was, how to be reuenged: he wanted not flatterers of all ſorts,<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> 
               <q>(an ordinarie plague attending great Princes, and which doeth puffe them vp with vanitie) who by a certaine reprochfull and artificiall interpretation,</q> did obſcure and<note place="margin">Spetches and perſwaſions of Mahomet his flatterers animating<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> him againſt Scanderbeg</note> 
               <q>detract from the honor and deſerts of the Chriſtians, offering both their perſons and their liues to ſerue againſt them, and vndertaking and promiſing, that they would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerreach and goe beyond the <hi>Epirot,</hi> were he neuer ſo cunning and well practiſed in ſleights &amp; policies: that euerie place was not as <hi>Modriſſa:</hi> that the ſtarres would not fauour him in all places: that he ſhould not find euerie one to be an <hi>Ameſe,</hi> nor a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breas,</hi> eſpecially when that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> ſhould ſee himſelfe beſet and aſſailed with ſuch a troubleſome <hi>Hydra</hi> hauing ſo many heades: and that of eche one which was cut off and ouercome, there ſhould ſtill ariſe another monſter who would neuer ceaſe to ſeeke to deuoure him. And were it that he were (as a man may ſay) euen in the armes of his <hi>Ieſus:</hi> yet ſhould he not be alwaies in ſafetie and ſecuritie.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mahomet</hi> did gladly giue care to the good affection of his people, and he would<note place="margin">Mahomet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſeth to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ſome of Scanderbeg his ſubiects.</note> not openly gaineſay nor contradict any one of them, that offered themſelues ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to theſe daungers: but the craftie Foxe had another matter hammering in his head: his braines were beating and deuiſing vpon another kinde of reuenge, which might be wrought with leſſe bloodſhed &amp; loſſe of his people: namely, how he might oppreſſe and confound this his aduerſarie by ſome ciuill and domeſticall warre, and by ſtirring vp againſt him the armes and ambuſhments of ſome of his owne ſubiects. For he knew, that where force of armes would not preuaile, there policie and other<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> 
               <q>ſleights of warre ought to ſupply their defects. A courſe which he himſelfe had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes put in practiſe with happie and good ſucceſſe againſt many others,</q> by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the tract which his father <hi>Amurath</hi> had troden before him, at ſuch time as he impatronized himſelfe vpon the empire of <hi>Greece.</hi> And (ſuch are the ticklings and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticementes of mens deſires, eſpecially when they ſeeke for Empires and dominions) he eaſily promiſed vnto himſelfe and was perſwaded, that he ſhould find ſome of the moſt inward and familiar friends of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> who would be wrought and allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be the authors and executioners of his wicked practiſe: wherein he was not altogether deceiued.</p>
            <p>At that time there were many about <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> who were of great account and authority with him, both in the adminiſtration of the eſtate, as alſo in the warres. But as <hi>Moſes</hi> did excell them all in the practiſe and experience of armes, ſo was he in the higheſt degree of fauour and reputation with his Prince: and <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> loued
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:13368:145"/>
and eſteemed him aboue all the reſt. This made the <hi>Ottoman</hi> to haue a deſire to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe<note place="margin">Mahomet ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the faith of Moſes.</note> and worke with this perſonage, and by the greatneſſe of his faire and large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, to make a conqueſt of the fortreſſe of his conſtancie, faith and loialtie. One thing there was which he did hope would greatly further the conuciance of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and that was, becauſe it was told him, that the lands and poſſeſſions of <hi>Moſes</hi> did bound and butte vpon his confines, eſpecially towards <hi>Sfetigrade:</hi> ſuppoſing that this neare neighbourhood would giue him the more eaſie and readie acceſſe to haue ſome ſpeech and conference with him: and that the whole matter might be handled the more conueniently and the more ſecretly. Wherefore touching any further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſions to be made for the wars, and to thoſe vaine offers &amp; vaunts made by his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers: he faigned that vpon ſome good conſiderations he would deferre the reuenge of his wrongs and outrages in <hi>Epire,</hi> till another time and ſeaſon, and then hauing communicated this ſecret with one or two of his moſt priuate and faithfull Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours, he wrote vnto the Gouernour of <hi>Sfetigrade</hi> in a moſt cunning and ſubtile manner, and the ſaying is, that he did the like to the Gouernour of <hi>Alchria.</hi> But it is not much materiall whether he writ to them both or not: yet I beleeue, that this web was weaued and this practiſe was begunne, continued and ended in one of thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces onely: neither was it wrought for all that without great daunger and difficultie: and the reaſon which maketh me to thinke ſo, is the qualitie of the caſe, and alſo for that the letters ſent to <hi>Alchria</hi> (if there were any) did neuer ſort to any purpoſe and effect.</p>
            <p>The Gouernour of <hi>Sfetigrade</hi> hauing receiued the letters which were ſent vnto him, did peruſe them verie ſecretly, and he had a great deſire to execute the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of his ſoueraigne as effectually as he might: for that by the accompliſhing of his will and pleaſure, he was ſure to become great, and to be highly rewarded. The ſubſtance of the letters in regard of <hi>Moſes</hi> was to this effect: That he ſhould deale<note place="margin">Letters of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet to the gouernor of Sfetigrade wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him to practiſe with Moſes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolt from Scanderbeg.</note> with him in the name of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and to put it to his choiſe, whether he would accept of money, or elſe haue preferment and aduancement of eſtate and liuings, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Turkes in the court of the Emperour, or (if he had rather) in the realme of <hi>Albanie,</hi> vpon this condition: That he ſhould make away <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> or by ſome meanes cauſe him to be made away: or at the leaſt by leauing of his ſeruice to follow the armes and partie of <hi>Ottoman.</hi> Many other good ſpeeches were added in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters fit to perſwade and induce him thereunto, by which it was eaſie to be diſcerned what was further to be done in the matter: albeit there was not any mention at all made of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And it was referred to the power and diſcretion of the gouernour to deale as the time and the place ſhould giue him opportunitie, and as he ſhould iudge to be moſt for the profit and dignitie of his maieſtie. The Barbarian forgot nothing of that was enioyned him, but vſed ſingular dexteritie, diligence, and diſcretion in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiting <hi>Moſes</hi> to conferre with him. And the better to attaine thereunto, he impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this matter to a Chriſtian one of his owne houſhold ſeruants, and by Nation an <hi>Albanois:</hi> putting him in hope, that it ſhould be the meane to enrich both him and his houſe for euer, if he could bring the <hi>Dibrian</hi> to this point to haue ſome ſpeech and conference with him. This fellow therefore did the gouernour ſend towards <hi>Moſes.</hi> The night ſeemed to be the fitteſt time for the effecting of this matter, during the<note place="margin">A meſſenger ſent to Moſes from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of Sfetigrade to practiſe with him for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolt.</note> which, this <hi>Epyrot</hi> taking his iorney, and being skilfull of all the places and paſſages of the countrie, he neuer loſt his way, but came directly to the place where he found <hi>Moſes</hi> with his garriſon in the frontiers of the Prouince. The <hi>Dibrian</hi> preſently vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the comming of this meſſenger from the enemie, gaue him conuenient opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to ſpeake vnto him, and withdrew him apart from all other companie; who
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:13368:145"/>
before that he came to breake with him any thing touching his meſſage or the cauſe of his comming, at the very firſt entreated him to take the paines to come to <hi>Sfety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade.</hi> Whereupon ſeeing him to refuſe ſo to doe, and that he did in a manner laugh at the impudency of the Infidels, he changed his courſe, and falling to flattering, and faire ſpeeches, he made him attentiue to his talke: then entring into the matter, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered to him in ſome ſort the intention and minde of the <hi>Sultan. Moſes</hi> gladly gaue eare vnto him, and with a wonderfull liking (ſuch is the variety of men eſpecially of them that follow armes) he ſwallowed vp the cunning the cloſe bait of his own prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: namely, when the meſſenger told him, that the great Turke did ſo highly honor and eſteeme of him, that he thought him only of all the flower of <hi>Epire,</hi> worthy to be ſollicited both by letters and by ſpeeches. Reaſon would he ſhould rather haue bluſhed for ſhame, to ſee him ſelfe only amongſt ſo many others (as a man forlorne &amp; of a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate hope) to be choſen and ſelected as a fit inſtrument and occaſion of ſo deteſtable and felonious an act, and of a crime ſo hatefull, vile &amp; trecherous. But ſuch is our <q>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt deſire of earthly honors, and ſo ambitious are our thoughts, aſpiring to glory and<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> Empire, that it maketh vs altogether to forget our ſelues and our dueties. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe for that time did <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhew him ſelfe both by his ſpeaches,</q> and by his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to be ſuch a one, that the ſubtill meſſenger could not tell what to make of him, or whether he did approue or reproue that which had beene propounded vnto him. Yet did this miniſter of Sathan ſufficiently coniecture of the meaning and thoughtes of the man, and therefore not detayning him with any further diſcourſe, but promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to returne vnto him againe ſhortly, he tooke his leaue and returned to the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. It is commonly reported, that when <hi>Moſes</hi> was demanded by ſome of his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, what communication had paſſed betweene them, he anſwered, that it was a ſpy of the partes neare about <hi>Sfetigrade,</hi> which came to giue him certain aduertiſements, and that he was in good hope by his aide and aſſiſtance to doe the king good ſeruice and greatly to further his attempts &amp; purpoſes. The ſouldiers did eaſily beleeue what he ſaied, as not miſtruſting any thing. Beſides that, the habit and attire, and the ſpeach of the meſſenger being a Chriſtian did ſeeme to perſwade and import no leſſe. And what reaſon had they but to credit <hi>Moſes,</hi> whoſe faith and fidelity had bene ſo nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly knowen and teſtified, and into whoſe handes the whole eſtate of his Prince had bene ſo often put and committed? eſpecially in the warre of <hi>Dayna,</hi> when that <hi>Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> on the one ſide, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> on the other ſide, did ſeeke to haue gotten the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of <hi>Epire</hi> from him? Notwithſtanding the <hi>Dibrian</hi> was noted euer afterwardes to be very ſad and penſiue, more then he was wont or vſually accuſtomed: which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded (as I ſuppoſe) of the remorſe of conſcience that ſeemed to touch him with a deepe conſideration of the fact, being ſo weighty, difficult, and important. He was mightely diſtracted and perplexed in his mind, ſomtimes his heart was touched with the thoughts and remembrance of the curteſie and humanity of his prince, who deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued no ſuch vnkinde and wicked part, and with the greatneſſe of the authority &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence which he had about <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> wherwith any other beſides him would haue held him ſelfe highly contented, ſometimes againe he conſidered the exceſsiue greatneſſe and rewardes offered him by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> eſpecially the crowne and ſcepter preſented vnto him, a thing ſo much deſired and affected of miſerable mortal men, and <q>ſo ſweete a thing doethe thinke it to ſit aloft, and to be preferred aboue other men.

            <p>Whileſt the <hi>Dibrian</hi> did remaine thus perplexed &amp; turmoiled with the vncertainty of his owne thoughts, behold our gentle meſſenger is againe returned, plentifully fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and prouided, not onely with words farre more ſweete and plauſible, but with<note place="margin">Moſes peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to become a traitour to Scanderbeg.</note> rich giftes and ſumptuous preſents: yet I doe not finde that <hi>Moſes</hi> did accept of any of them, but that onely his mind was now throughly poſſeſſed with a diſpoſition encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to infidelity and treaſon. Notwithſtanding the aunſwere which he made to the <q>meſſenger, did ſufficiently diſcouer the malady of his minde: for he willed him to<note place="margin">Speeche of Moſes to the Turkiſh meſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſenger.</note> come no more into his preſence, that he did moſt humbly thanke the <hi>Sultan</hi> for his great fauour, and good will, and promiſed him ſo to cary and demeane himſelfe, that from thenceforward he ſhould not find him to be his enemy.</q> Thus whileſt that <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi> being ignoraunt of the counſels of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> doth ſend abroad eſpials on all ſides, to ſound and ſearch out his determinations, the Infidelles are plotting and deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing how to worke him a greater miſchiefe, and to ouerwhelme him with a daunger farre more pernicious.</p>
            <p>It hath bene before touched, how that both <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> and his ſubiects, did delay<note place="margin">Scanderbeg de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth to haue the aide of Italians in the warres.</note> and put off the warre, and the beſieging of townes for a ſeaſon, to a time then prefixed and appointed: which being now expired, and no newes of any motions or tumults heard of from <hi>Andrinople,</hi> but that all things were in good reſt and quietneſſe; the king of <hi>Albany</hi> bethought and deuiſed with him ſelfe what expedition were beſt to be vndertaken, and what things were requiſite to haue it well and orderly executed. To this end he was reſolued (if he might) to aide him ſelfe with the ſuccours of the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talians,</hi> conſidering, that though his ſubiects were excellent in fighting of maine bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, and in combatting hand to hand in the plaine field: yet did he not thinke them to be fitte or ſufficient for the aſſaulting of holdes, and the forcing of townes, and ſuch like ſeruices. <hi>Alphonſus</hi> King of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Naples</hi> (of whom mention hath beene often made) did keepe his Court continually at <hi>Naples,</hi> which was not farre diſtant from thence. And for as much as not onely <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> but in a manner all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, did vſe this Prince with a kind of familiarity, he tooke care to vſe the helpe of no other, but of him onely; aſſuring him ſelfe, that of all the Princes and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates Chriſtian, he ſhould not finde any more willing nor more ready to aide and aſsiſt him. For this cauſe before hee would proclaime any leauy or muſter of men within his Prouince, he cauſed two good and ſtrong ſhippes to be rigged, trimmed, and made ready: which being richly furniſhed and fraughted with many excellent and ſumptuous preſentes, he ſent with two of the greateſt and nobleſt perſons of his kingdome vnto <hi>Alphonſus</hi> with letters written in moſt familiar and pleaſaunt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.

            <p>This ſhort Oration did ſo chafe the harts of the ſouldiers, that beſides infinit vaunts and brauadoes (as is vſuall in ſuch caſes) ſome of them flocked together about the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour, and with great inſtance beſought him to grant them leaue to ſally forth, &amp; to ſet vpon the enemy: but he refuſed to yeeld vnto their demaund, by reaſon hee was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> did approach, betweene whoſe arriuall and theſe accidentes,<note place="margin">Scanderbeg be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Belgrade.</note> there was litle or no great ſpace. It was about the tenth houre, that the troupes of the <hi>Albanois</hi> did appeare before the towne, and did encampe them ſelues cloſe together in a large plaine vnd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r the walles. Firſt they tooke their repaſt all at their eaſe, and then afterwardes they parted their companies, each hauing their ſeuerall quarter appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">Number of Scanderbeg his armie before Belgrade.</note> them. The numbers of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> his army, was 15000. men, 8000. horſe, 7000. foote. They were placed round about ouer the plaine, and vpon the mountaine, the which being not very high nor ſteepe, did ſerue as well for the horſemen to encampe in, as the footmen. And for this cauſe was the artillery planted there alſo in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces fit and conuenient, to make a battery againſt the wals. By that time that all things were ordained in a readineſſe, the night ouertooke them, the audacity and fierceneſſe of the beſieged was much abated, by the terrible ſhewe and aſpect of our people, and eſpecially by the view of thoſe peeces and engines prepared for the battering and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulting of the towne.</p>
            <p>Immediatly vpon the breake of day, the ordinaunce began to thunder moſt furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and the Curtin in ſome places began to be diſmanteled, and the Flankers to<note place="margin">Belgrade bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</note> be razed: whereupon the defendants both falling to conſultation, and yet labouring the whileſt to repaire the breaches, were for a time deuided into contrary opinions, being in doubt whether it were beſt to demaund a Parley or not, before that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie ſhould come to the ſcaling of the walles, and that the furie of the aſſault ſhould bebegunne. For they were ſore affrayed, leſt they ſhould not be able to maintaine the place: and if in the middle and heate of the fight they ſhould intend it, that then the ſouldiours being caried away with the hope of victorie, would not be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to yeeld vnto it. But the Gouernour would not in any caſe conſent thereunto: telling them, That the perill as yet was not ſo great, and that they ſhould at all times finde oportunitie enough to take that courſe ſo vile and ignominious: whereupon they were ſatisfied, and ſurceaſed that motion. The next day likewiſe paſſed in the ſame manner, for that the breache was not yet aſſaultable, nor ſufficient to receiue the ſouldiours, and <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> cauſed the batterie to continue ſtill with great furie. And after two dayes were ſpent in that ſort, and that the ditches were nowe filled vp with the ruines of the wall: he withdrewe his ordinaunce from that ſide where the towne was made leaſt defenſible, and for that it was nowe time to vſe the furie of his ſouldiours, he appointed the next day to giue an aſſault, and to make a triall of their valour, commaunding them to be ready by the breake of the next morning: which was done accordingly. As the enſignes were readie diſplayed, and that the ſouldiours with great cries and clamours began to march in good order and reſolution, certaine<note place="margin">Belgradians demand a truce</note> of the towne came foorth ſuddenly and met them: who being conducted to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Prince, required to haue truce; which was ſoone and eaſily graunted

them. Afterwardes demaunding what their compoſition ſhould be, if they did yeeld <q>them ſelues: Such (quoth <hi>Scanderbeg</hi>) as is due to men that doe yeeld: to wit, their liues ſaued,</q> and free libertie to depart with their armour, bagge and baggage: as for the reſt, it did belong to the victours. The two meſſengers being returned, and their aunſwer openly reported, the defendants were generally ſadde and ſorrowfull, that ſo hard conditions ſhould be impoſed vpon them, all things being as yet ſound and in good eſtate: whereas if their caſe had bene deſperate, and the towne forced to the vttermoſt, euen they that were in a manner vanquiſhed, might eaſily obtaine ſuch an agreement. The garriſon were penſiue and ſore grieued: feare and deſpite made them to haue manie motions and conceipts in their minds. The Chriſtians ſayd neuer a word, notwithſtanding that by the articles propounded for their compoſition, they ſawe they ſhould be depriued both of their goods and their houſes. True it is, that they were in a good hope, that if the place came into the handes of the Chriſtians, they ſhould obtaine of the King of <hi>Albanie</hi> what ſoeuer they would demaund. And therefore they made no ſhewe howe they were affected, either on the one ſide or the other, nor what they thought of the conditions, for feare leſt they ſhould renewe and reuiue the ſuſpition that had bene before conceiued of them. Being demaunded of the Gouernour what their opinion was, they refuſed to ſhew their mindes, giuing him<note place="margin">Gouernour of Belgrade con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulteth with the citizens vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the conditions offred by Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg. Anſwer of the citizens of Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade to the Gouernour.</note> onely this anſwer: That they did expect from him not interrogatories, but commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements: that whatſoeuer he ſhould iudge to be for the honour and profit of all in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, that would they maintaine and ratifie, both armed and diſarmed. A great part of that day was ſpent in conſultations: at laſt it was concluded, that they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund a truce and abſtinence from armes for one whole moneth, during which time if there came no ſuccours, that then they would ſubmit them ſelues to the conditions and offers which were propounded. They were in hope that <hi>Mahomet</hi> would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure this ſhame and infamie, but would either be there himſelf in perſon, or elſe would ſend ſome ſuccours with all ſpeed. For before the comming of <hi>Tanuſee,</hi> they had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertized him of the preparations made againſt them. Thus by this pollicie and deuice they did hope to preſerue their libertie &amp; their towne without any bloudſhed or loſſe at all. And if the Chriſtian did deny to condeſcend to this agreement, that then each man ſhould be reſolute, and prepare him ſelfe with a good courage to the defence of their walles, and to vſe their vttermoſt obſtinacie againſt ſo obſtinate an enemy. The meſſengers being ſent backe with theſe capitulations to the campe of the Chriſtians, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> made no other accompt of theſe demaundes, but reputed them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be laughed at, willing them either to be better aduiſed, and that with ſpeede, or elſe to prepare them ſelues to the extremitie of a generall aſſault. In the end when he ſawe that they were ſo fully and firmely determined, as they would not abate ſo much as fiue dayes of the delaye and reſpite which they demaunded, he grewe into greater choller: but the night comming vppon them, did put off the concluſion thereof for that inſtant. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> calling a Counſell to conſult and deliberate vpon <q>the matter, ſome of his chiefe Lordes and eldeſt Captaines were of opinion: That<note place="margin">Speeches of ſome of the Nobles and Captaines of Scanderbeg: perſwading him to accept the offers of the Belgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians.</note> he ſhould not altogether reiect theſe demaundes, but that he ſhould ſound the beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged euen to the laſt point, whether they would abridge anie part of that time. They alledged the difficulties that would impeach them from carrying of the place: for that the toppe of the mountaine (whereon the citie was ſeated) did not for the moſt part admit and giue anie eaſie acceſſe vnto thoſe that ſhould labour to clime the ſame: and that the great ſtonie rocks naturally ariſing in many places round about the town, and being wrought by arte into the circuite of the walles,</q> and ſo ſeruing for a forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to the towne in many places, would eaſily ſcorne all the force and violence
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:13368:150"/>
of their ordinaunce, and make them of no power nor vertue: in regard whereof it <q>might be an occaſion that the ſiege might be of long continuaunce. They alleaged moreouer, that how ſoeuer it fell out, and whether the truce were either graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or denied to the defendaunts, yet they beleeued that the <hi>Sultan</hi> would not faile, to ayde and to ſend them ſuccours: that the daunger would be much greater and more to be feared, if hee ſhould come and finde them wearied and ſore laboured, whereas if he came not at all, or that he did foreſlow his comming, they might then obtaine the towne without any bloudſhed, and without any loſſe or hazard of their people: or in caſe he did come in good time to their reſcue, yet they might then take their choiſe both of the time and the occaſion, according as it ſhould offer it ſelfe: that all things would fall out conueniently and to his aduauntage in the fight, and would be to the furtherance of his victory, and to the greatneſſe of his glorie. That he had with as ſmall forces as thoſe then preſent, giuen a memorable ouerthrow to <hi>Haly Baſſa.</hi> Moreouer, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> in regard of his couetous deſire and vnſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable ambition to the Empire of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> had cleane forgotten the warre of <hi>Epire.</hi> And they ſuppoſed that the <hi>Belgradians</hi> did demand this time of truce, for the deliuery of their towne, to no other end and purpoſe, but onely becauſe the king of Turkes ſhould not blame them for yeelding it vp ſo haſtily and ſhamefully, and to the intent, when they ſhould be caſt out of their dwellings, and ſpoyled of all their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce, they might be thought worthy both of pardon and compaſsion. <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg</hi> ſmiling at theſe their allegations, replied vnto them in this manner.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſee (quoth he) that the <hi>Albanians</hi> are glutted with ſo many victories, that they are <note place="margin">Anſwer of Scanderbeg to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of his Chiefetaines, touching the graunting of truce to the Belgradians</note>

They haue neede to be viſited with ſome miſaduenture (God graunt that it happen not vnto them) to chaſtiſe them for their ſloth and negligence. Beſides, who will not condemne vs of ouer much credulitie? If we remember, the like fraude was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed againſt vs heretofore by them of <hi>Sfetigrade,</hi> and they deluded vs in the ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. What thinke you is then to be done, when the prefixed time of the truce being expired, you ſhall finde either their deceipt ſecretly hidden to be diſcouered: or that their minds ſhall be altered and chaunged? We ſhall then abide hard penance for our light credulitie, and in vaine ſhall we repent the loſſe of the time paſt: and we ſhall be conſtrained in the meane time to depend wholy vpon the pleaſure and faith of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. And how ſoeuer there be many things alledged touching the difficulty of the ſiege, and the occupations of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> yet ought not wee for all that to deferre that which the vrgency of our affaires doeth require to be done. And if it happen that whileſt we are buſied in forcing of the towne, there do appeare any likelihood ofſtirs from <hi>Andrinople,</hi> we haue forces ſufficient both to defend our ſelues, and to ſecure vs from their attempts.

            <p>After the matter had bene long debated and diſcuſſed to and fro, notwithſtanding<note place="margin">Truce for ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene dayes granted to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Belgrade.</note> anie thing that had bene ſayd to the contrarie, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> was content in the ende to ſubſcribe to the opinion of the greateſt number.

The haughtie and generous courage of this young Prince, did aſpire to the dominion of the whole worlde: the boundes of his ambition did exceede farre beyonde the ſucceſſion of his fathers Empire, and he ſought to ſurmount the glorie of all his aunceſtors. For
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:13368:152"/>
caſting his thoughts to higher enterpriſes, he was reſolued to reduce within the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his conqueſts, the proude and triumphant citie of <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> and he helde it to be a great blot and ſtaine to his honour to entitle himſelfe Emperour of <hi>Greece,</hi> and not to haue the poſſeſſion of the Imperiall ſeate and capitall city of that Empire. Beſides, he conſidered this with himſelfe, that by enterpriſing an exploite of ſo high regard, he ſhould make his memorie immortall ouer the whole earth, and that all the Nations and peoples of the world, would be ſtriken with the terror of his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull actes, in that he being but in the prime and entrance of his youth, ſhould be able to make a conqueſt of a towne ſo puiſſant, and to purchaſe to himſelfe a name ſo glorious and renowned. And he was the more enflamed in this his deſire and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe his predeceſſors hauing oftentimes attempted the winning of that towne, had alwayes bene repulſed with ſome diſgrace and loſſe of honor and reputation.</p>
            <p>Aſſoone therefore as the newes of <hi>Belgrade</hi> was come vnto his eares, he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely grieued and perplexed, and he complained with infinite plaints and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, that fortune ſhould ſo croſſe and diſturbe his attempts, as to take out of his hands the ioy, benefit, and aduantage of a glorie ſo excellent and incomparable.

               <q>But <hi>Mahomet</hi> replyed and told them, ſaying: That his aunceſtors neuer taught him<note place="margin">Speech of Mahomet to his Baſſaes perſwading him not to leaue his voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople for Belgrade.</note> that leſſon, to abandon and forſake the defence of his owne againſt the iniuries of his enemies, whileſt of an ambitious mind he ſought that which belonged to other men. That for his part he reputed all conqueſts and ech victorie vile and diſhonorable, and that glory to be baſe, &amp; of no moment nor eſtimat, which ſhould be defiled or ſtained with the leaſt touch of ignominie. Can it be good or commendable (quoth he) for a Prince to amplifie &amp; enlarge his Empire with the one hand, and to diminiſh &amp; leſſen it with the other? how ſhall I beleeue, that any of my people can fight with quiet and ſetled mindes in <hi>Romania,</hi> as long as their fancies and imaginations are caried away with thinking, that a vile &amp; lewd fugitiue is triumphing the whileſt ouer <hi>Macedony,</hi> and is tearing, rending, and ſpoiling the bodies of their fellows &amp; companions? True it may be, that vpon the <hi>Greekes</hi> we may purchaſe vs great honor, and greater ſpoiles and bootie: but the loſſe of <hi>Belgrade</hi> will be more to our detriment and diſaduantage then we can reap profit by the conqueſt of the whole <hi>Leuant.</hi> It behoueth Monarches &amp; great conquerors to be carefull of their fame and reputation, and (as good &amp; excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent tutors &amp; protectors) to preſerue it vnſpotted &amp; vnblameable, both towards them which are aliue preſent, and to the poſteritie that are to ſucceede hereafter.

It ſtandeth vs vpon firſt to quench this fire within our own dores, for feare leaſt being neglected, it grow more ſtrong &amp; violent, and ſpread farther abroad: and the fury of a people ſo proud &amp; inſolent, is not to be left vnpuniſhed and vnſubdued.

            <p>But his Baſſaes ſhewing him that <hi>Belgrade</hi> was ſtrongly and excellently well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, that it was abundantly prouided of all neceſſaries for defence: and that for the more ſecuritie, he might ſende thither ſuch freſh ſuccours, as it ſhould be impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the enemie to winne it, and that the voyage of <hi>Romania</hi> needed not in the meane while to be interrupted: All this would not anie whit perſwade him, nor turne his obſtinate minde from the warre of <hi>Epyre.</hi> For the ſiege of <hi>Belgrade</hi> and the onely ſhame thereof had ſwallowed vppe all his thoughtes and imaginations,<note place="margin">Turkes their wonderfull care to preſerue their conqueſts</note> and his head was alwayes deuiſing vppon the ſame. And to ſpeake the trueth, I dare aſſure you, that there is not anie Nation nor kinde of men vnder the heauens more diligent and carefull in preſeruing of their conqueſtes, and in keeping the countries which they haue gotten from their enemies, then are the Turkes. For they holde it a moſt notable iniurie, and eternall ſhame and infamie, that their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhould take from them one foote of ground, whereof they are the owners: or ſhould innouate, alter, or chaunge any thing vppon their poſſeſſions. It ſhall not be impertinent in this place to recount an accident which is as yet freſh in memorie, during the raigne of the laſt <hi>Baiazeth.</hi> The <hi>Hungarians</hi> had erected neere to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer<note place="margin">An act of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iazeth the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond vpon the riuer of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowe or Danu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius in Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie.</note> of <hi>Danowe</hi> a tower of wood ſeruing to diuerſe vſes and priuate commodities, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to any purpoſe of ſeruice for the warres: a worke in trueth that was not worth the ſpeaking of. <hi>Baiazeth</hi> being aduertiſed thereof, could not moderate his paſſions, but to his extreame charges and expences, he aſſembled forthwith a mighty armie, onely and of purpoſe to ouerthrow and beate downe this edifice. And he held it not ſufficient to commit the execution thereof to his Lieutenants, but he would needes be there in proper perſon, waſting and deſtroying the whole countrie adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. The <hi>Hungarians</hi> thought it not beſt to oppoſe themſelues againſt his furie, but gaue place vnto him, and made a mocke of ſo fooliſh and outragious a part: and ſo litle did they grieue at the dammage offered them, that they wiſhed him many ſuch victories. Now whether this diligence in the Turkes be either to be commended or diſcommended, this is moſt certaine, that the euent of things doth apparantly make ſhew of it.

            <p>The great Turke taking that courſe which the importance of thoſe affayres did<note place="margin">Sebalias ſent againſt Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg with an army of 40000 horſe.</note> require, amongeſt all his ſeruants made choiſe of <hi>Sebalias,</hi> a Captaine more politique and ſubtill, then aduenturous and hardie: and who more then once had tryed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againſt <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi> In regard whereof he made him Generall of this iourney into <hi>Epyre,</hi> and gaue him the commaund of 40000. horſe, all choſen men and well appointed: ſo that they made a goodly armie, very ſtrong both for their number and for their valure. <hi>Mahomet</hi> calling <hi>Sebalias</hi> vnto him before his departure, helde him with a long diſcourſe, vſing not onely exhortations and perſwaſions, but with many praiers expreſſed in moſt vrgent and earneſt tearmes, he entreated him, that he would employ all his diligence, induſtrie, courage, &amp; vigilancie, &amp; the beſt &amp; moſt ſufficient meanes he was poſſibly able in that ſeruice, to bring that warre to a good end, and to reſcue his ſubiects, promiſing him great riches, honors, and aduancement euen in the<note place="margin">Mahomet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpireth the death of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg.</note> higheſt degree that he could beſtow vpon him, and as farre as himſelfe would wiſh and deſire: eſpecially if he could bring him either the head of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> cut from his

And becauſe he was in great feare and doubt, leaſt they within the towne ſhould not hold out till his comming: hauing a deſire to put them in good courage &amp; hope, by the expectation of ſpeedie ayde and ſuccours: he had no ſooner gotten his diſpatch from the <hi>Sultan,</hi> but he determined to ſende away ſpeedily a Poaſt with letters to them that were beſieged. But the chiefeſt care and difficultie was howe to get a man fit and able to vndertake the enterpriſe, and that durſt expoſe himſelfe to the hazard<note place="margin">A Poaſt ſent by Sebalias to carrie newes of ſuccours to the Belgradians.</note> of ſo great and manifeſt a perill. And yet the large promiſes which he made were ſufficient not onely to haue inuited and allured, but in a manner to haue enforced the heart of any man to aduenture it. In the ende, they found one a very quicke and light fellow, who being preſently mounted vpon the ſwifteſt horſe in all the armie, ſpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red away with all ſpeede, ſparing neither by day nor by night, no trauaile nor paynes, nor for anie extreamitie of the heate, ſo as in three dayes or little more he came to a towne vnder the obeiſance of the Turkes, named <hi>Gyrocaſtra,</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout<note place="margin">Gyrocaſtra.</note> ſome ſixe ſcore and fiue miles from <hi>Belgrade.</hi> The Turkes haue no ordinarie and ſet Poaſtes in <hi>Turkie,</hi> but in ſtead of them, and becauſe vppon ſuch occurrences, their Curriers (whom they call <hi>Vlach</hi>) ſhall not be vnprouided of horſes, the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>

This meſſenger being arriued at <hi>Gyrocaſtra,</hi> and hauing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated his buſineſſe to the Magiſtrates of that place, by their counſell and aduiſe ſtaied there that day till it grew to night: then leauing there his horſe, and chaunging his attire (the better to deceiue the ſcoutes of the Chriſtians) in the darke of the night, he tooke his iourney on foote, and at the length, he got neere the towne on that ſide where <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> himſelfe lay encamped. For the tentes of the two Thopies, and the reſt which lay in the open plaine, ſtoode farther off, ſo as they could not perceiue him. Both the one and the other of them were eaſily deceiued, for that the meſſenger (hauing verie aduiſedly ſhunned the tentes of the Chriſtians, and taken the other ſide of the mountaine, where the way was more couert, and the paſſage more harde and difficult, had ſo ſecretly and cloſely conueyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe euen to the foote of the towne wall, that he was ſcarcely diſcerned by the Sentinelles of the towne. Vnto whom, after that he had by whiſteling and calling
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:13368:153"/>
vnto them, made himſelfe knowen by his ſpeech, he was ſuddenly drawen vp with a corde let downe from the wall, and ſo conueyed into the towne. As he went on to<note place="margin">Belgradians aduertiſed of ſuccours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to relieue them.</note> ſeeke out the Gouernor, the common people in a great confuſion came running about him on all ſides, and in great doubt and ſuſpence began to enquire of him, &amp; to learne what good newes he had brought: for the end of the truce was now neere at hand, and the time approched wherein they were to auoide the towne. The Gouernor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing cauſed the common people to depart, and calling the meſſenger vnto him, he queſtioned with him in ſecret, very few being preſent: after he had receiued and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed the letter, he gaue credit to that which the meſſenger reported: by meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Captaines of the garriſon conſulting together, did conclude and determine if neede were, to ſtand reſolutely in defence of the place, till the comming of <hi>Sebalias</hi> to relieue them: and when the day-light ſhould appeare, they appointed that theſe tydings ſhould be publiſhed and made knowen to them of the town, and it was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly imparted vnto all of them, not with a loude voice or open proclamation, but by the mouth of the Gouernor himſelfe, firſt in the market place, and after from one to another, with an expreſſe charge and commaundement to keepe it ſecret, that they without might not be aduertiſed of it. For they had a great deſire both to deceiue and delude them by the meanes of this truce taken for the rendring of the towne, as alſo to ſee them ſuddenly ſurpriſed and oppreſſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The inhabitantes and garriſon of <hi>Belgrade</hi> were in ſome doubt, leaſt that their<note place="margin">Belgradians repaire their breach contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement.</note> ſuccours would not come timely enough and before the truce were expyred: by meanes whereof eyther they ſhould be driuen to defende them ſelues, or elſe to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe and forſake the towne. For this cauſe they beganne to repaire their walles and baſtilles, where they had beene battered and beaten with the artillerie. The Generall of the Chriſtians perceiuing this, and miſdoubting ſome fraude, entred into great choller, and was in a minde to haue aſſaulted them: neuertheleſſe for that the time of the truce was to expire within a three dayes, he pacified himſelfe, and was content<note place="margin">Meſſage of Scanderbeg to the Belgradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans willing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to deſiſt from repairing of their town<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That they ſhould ſurceaſe therefore from their worke, or otherwiſe if they came afterwardes to endure the rigour and extreamitie of their enemies, they ſhoulde impute it, not to anie breach of faith in them, but to their owne default and deſerts. The inhabitants in outwarde ſhewe and appearance ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to obey it, and did forbeare from doing any thing, that their enemies could ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſee or perceiue: notwithſtanding they continued night and day by all other meanes, as to carrie earth, to ſtrengthen the walles, to lay together great heapes of ſtones, and other prouiſions fit to throwe vppon their enemies: all which they did cloſe behinde their rampiers. O of what power, force, and efficacie is hope, ſo to<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> alter and chaunge the mindes of mortall men, and to make them ſo variable and <q>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant?

<pb n="294" facs="tcp:13368:154"/>
and to demaund reaſon for their faith and promiſe violated. Neuertheleſſe ſtill did they continue running vp and downe the walles, getting to the toppes of their houſes and into all the towers and higheſt places of the towne to ſee, if they could diſcouer the aide and ſuccours which they expected and deſired ſo earneſtly: or if they could perceiue any duſt of their horſes, or heare any noiſe of their comming by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the countrie. Their eyes were clearer ſighted then ordinarie, whatſoeuer ſound they heard, whatſoeuer obiect preſented it ſelfe to their ſenſes, they thought it to be <q>

            </p>
            <p>That which gaue cauſe of hope to them of <hi>Belgrade,</hi> was an occaſion of feare and ſuſpition to the Chriſtians: they regarded no leſſe carefully then the others, the toppes and higheſt places of the mountaines where their ſcoutes were placed, to ſee if they could diſcerne any aduertiſement by boughes and branches of trees, or by fires or any other ſigne giuen them to arme themſelues, and to prepare to horſebacke, it being a thing not poſſible to keepe them continually ſadled, nor themſelues alwaies in armes, by reaſon of the violent and extreame heate, which did make their bodies very faint<note place="margin">Chriſtians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Belgrade ſurpriſed by the Turkes.</note> and feeble. But the Enſignes of the enemie were in ſight, and their cries and clamors were heard amongeſt them before that they had any notice or warning giuen them by ther ſcoutes of their approch and comming. Not much vnlike vnto a companie of ſeafaring men and ſaylers, who being embarked &amp; becalmed vpon the maine ſeas, whileſt the Maſter and Pilots do looke vp to the flagge or ſtreames to ſee what wind<note place="margin">An excellent compariſon.</note> doth blow, to the intent they may fit their tackling, and make readie their ſayles: ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly in the meane time being ouertaken with an outragious and horrible tempeſt, (whereof there appeareth not any precedent ſignes either by darke cloudes, or the roaring of the ſeas, nor any other ſuch celeſtiall threates and tokens) by reaſon wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are ſuddenly oppreſſed, not fearing any ſuch matter: their ſayles are rent and torne, their maſtes blowen ouerborde, their gables and anchors are loſt, and they (not able to worke, whileſt they are buſied on all ſides to attend their charges and ſeuerall duties) are conſtrained in the end with the violence of the tempeſt, to giue ouer and to leaue all to the mercie of the winde and weather, and of fortune, and to haue a care onely of their owne ſafetie: ſo did it now fall out with the Chriſtians lying before <hi>Belgrade.</hi> For they hauing their eyes alwayes regarding the toppes of the mountaines to ſee ſome ſigne giuen them from their Sentinels, had the ſword of the enemie ouer their heads, before they diſcerned or perceiued any ſuch matter. It is a wonderfull<note place="margin">Comming of Sebalias why concealed from Scanderbeg.</note> thing to imagine how ſo great preparations, and the ſudden approch of the Infidels could be ſo concealed, that euen the very ſtones and riuers (as a man may ſay) did not reueale it. In all the warres that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> had made, he was neuer without ſpyes, fugitiues, letters, or ſome ſuch ſecret aduertiſements of his friendes, ſaue onely at this inſtant, when he had moſt neede of them. But it may be, that the preparations for the warre of <hi>Greece</hi> being begunne, and continuing ſo long, was the cauſe he was ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued: by reaſon that <hi>Mahomet</hi> hauing his great armie in a readines for another ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, did on a ſudden employ part of thoſe forces, and that with ſingular diligence, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy, &amp; celerity, ſo as no report nor eſpials could eaſily preuent their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming; as they might haue done, if an armie had bene leauied and raiſed purpoſely for this iourney. Beſides, letters and meſſengers haue not alwayes free libertie of paſſage. And as for the watches and ſcoutes which were placed vpon the mountaines purpoſely for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering of the approach of the enemie: and vppon whom principally did depende the ſafetie of the Chriſtian armie before <hi>Belgrade:</hi> they neuer gaue them any ſigne

nor token of their comming, nor it was neuer knowen what became of them.<note place="margin">Scouts of the Albanois ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized by the enemie.</note> There is great varietie and diuerſitie of opinions concerning thoſe ſcoutes: ſome ſay they were corrupted by the Turke: others affirme, that they were ſurprized, and put to the ſword by the vauntcurrers of the Barbarians, who found them verie neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently walking vp and downe, about the freſh and moſt delectable places of the mountaines, taking their pleaſure and recreation: by meanes whereof they could not giue any ſigne to the campe, as it was concluded. For my part I know not well what to thinke of it. Touching their infidelitie, I ſuppoſe it was not a thing ſo eaſie to be compaſſed: for albeit it were a matter which amongſt a few might ſoone haue bene contriued; yet amongeſt ſo many it was verie difficult, and in a manner incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible: in like caſe, that they ſhould be ſlaine it is as vnlikely: for neither were their dead bodies euer ſeene or heard of after that: nor any reliques, markes, or apparance of them: and therefore ſome doe affirme, and it is moſt likely, that they were taken aliue by the enemie. Howſoeuer it was, the other watches which were appointed to watch elſe where, could not diſcouer the enemie till they were come verie neare them: and yet aſſoone as they coulde, they gaue them ſome warning. By meanes whereof, they had a verie litle and ſhort time to make readie their companies, and to put themſelues in order for to fight with the enemie. Neither was it poſſible that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> ſhould ſend any ſcoutes farther off, to beat the wayes, and to diſcouer the paſſages, or to prouide better for the ſafetie of his campe (as he was wont) becauſe all the whole countrey round about being for the enemie, they might eaſily haue bene entrapped by ſome ſecret ambuſhments, or openly diſtreſſed by the force of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. And it may be, that his miſfortune and deſtinie, did not permit him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe &amp; inuent any better remedie againſt that miſchiefe which hanged ouer his head. For we ſee it is a common and vſuall courſe with fortune to oppoſe herſelfe as a <q>ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> againſt the enterpriſes of great perſonages: and being not able to ſuffer the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of their good happe, nor willing that it ſhould be perdurable: ſhe doth often interrupt the courſe of their beſt and moſt glorious actions.</q> But let vs proceed with the ſcope of our hiſtorie.</p>
            <p>Theſe fiue and twentie men which were ordained to watch vpon the mountaine, either by treaſon or by negligence (as hath bene <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For <hi>Muſache</hi> (who lay encamped next to that ſide where the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie did approach and was to ſuſtaine the firſt brunt and onſet that ſhould be giuen) would hardly be perſwaded that the Turkes were at hand: notwithſtanding that the<note place="margin">Muſache de Thopie brother in law to Scan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derbeg, ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in his quarter by the Turkes.</note> watch did continue the allarme, and did in a manner ſhew him the duſt raiſed by the trampling of their horſes. Some ſay that he was found ſleeping in his tent: others ſay that he was playing at dice with one of the Gentlemen of the Kings priuie chamber, and that the Turkes comming vpon him vnprouided, did bereaue him of all meanes of hope to mount on horſebacke, and enforced him on foote to ſeeke to ſaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by flying towardes the mountaine. But the moſt common opinion is: that he had ſome time and Ieiſure (though verie litle) to put on his armour, and to mount on horſebacke: and that he loſt his life fighting valiantly euen in the formoſt ranckes of his companie: and that vpon his death the reſidue beganne to flie. For aſſoone as the ſtandards of the Infidels and their vauntcurrers began to appeare in ſight, <hi>Muſache</hi> hauing ordered his troups, as well as the ſhortneſſe of the time would giue him leaue, was at the firſt in ſome doubt, whether he ſhould ſtand and abide the charge, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take himſelfe to flight towards the maine ſtrength and bodie of the armie. But becauſe the enemie was nowe ſo neare, that he thought his flight would cauſe the greater ſlaughter of his companie: beſides, for that he tooke not the enemie to be ſo ſtrong as
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:13368:155"/>
he afterwardes founde them: and being vnwilling alſo to looſe his life with diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor by any default in himſelfe, or to abandon and forſake his Prince, and the others who were lodged on the mountaine: he ſetled himſelfe to receiue the enemie; and therefore couragiouſly he endured the charge, and ſtoutly oppoſed himſelfe againſt their furie and violence. For a time he held good, neither his courage failing him, nor his forces: and he was reſolute, not to looſe his life without a braue reuenge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his companie. In the ende perceiuing by the ſlaughter of his companions, that his flanckes lay open to the enemie, and that his vertue and perſeuerance was in vaine and vnprofitable, he did aſſay many times by trauerſing and courſing vppe and downe the fielde, to ſaue himſelfe and the reſt of his men by making towardes the mountaine, for other place of refuge there was none thereabouts, where he might if not auoid, yet at leaſt wiſe delay the extreamitie of the daunger. But the enemie ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſhut vp all the wayes by which he might ſafely make a retrait, and he being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed on all ſides as in a parke, with the ineſtimable multitude of his enemies: and ſeeing that both his life and honor did now hang in the ballance of chaunce and caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie: with a deſperate reſolution, turning his valour and proweſſe into rage and furie, he terrified the enemie with the wonderfull aſtoniſhment of his hardines and auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie,<note place="margin">Muſache his death and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious end.</note> and euen in the middeſt of them fighting valiantly, he left his life worthy of eternall praiſe and commendation, for the many worthie ſeruices done to his Prince and countrey. <hi>Tanuſee Thopie</hi> on the other ſide, albeit he werein no leſſe diſtreſſe, yet hauing a compaſſion at the miſhap of his vncle, he ſeemed to forget all other occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and as a man tranſported with outrage and furie, did enforce himſelfe many times, by charging valiantly vpon the enemie, to open him a free way and paſſage. But in the end knowing all his endeuors to be in vaine, and that there now remained no other point of charitie to be ſhewed towardes him, vnleſſe he would beare him companie in the like vnhappie end; he thought it beſt to forbeare fighting: to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent he might ſaue the reſt which were left, and hauing gathered them neere about him, he perſwaded them to ſecure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues by flying. The like did <hi>Tanuſee Gynache,</hi> and the reſidue, howbeit that their flight did abate little or nothing of their daunger, nor of the ſlaughter. For the Turkes being diſperſed here and there, and deuided into ſeuerall bandes and ſquadrons, ſome of them did continue enuironing of <hi>Muſache</hi> and his companie, as long as there remained any of them liuing: and others purſuing after thoſe that fled, did neuer giue ouer the aduantage which they had gotten, but followed it to the ſingular and extreame dammage of the Chriſtians. He that ſhould haue ſeene this diſorder would haue thought, that that good fortune which had euer heretofore ſeconded the <hi>Albanois,</hi> had now left and forſaken them, to follow the part of the Infidels. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> (whoſe tents were ſomewhat further remoued from this bickering) was oftentimes about to haue deſcended into the plaine, with a full deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to doe his beſt and laſt endeuours for the ayding and ſuccouring of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or by his owne death to make the victorie of <hi>Sebalias</hi> much more noble and glorious.

But it was the occaſion that he loſt the oportunitie of ſeeing the finall ende of his aduerſarie, and of obtayning a full and abſolute triumph for that daies iourney.</p>
            <p>When the King of <hi>Albanie</hi> ſaw that there was litle or no daunger behind from<note place="margin">Scanderbeg deſcendeth downe the hill into the plaine againſt Sebalias.</note> the rereward of the enemies armie, he drew forth his ſquadrons with ſingular good aduiſe and iudgement: and deſcended downe into the plaine, according as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent trouble and confuſion would giue him leaue, placing his infanterie in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, and enuironning them with his horſemen. All this while did not they of the towne make any ſally forth vpon the Chriſtians, neither whileſt they fought, nor at their departure: which is a thing much to be wondered at, conſidering that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged did plainly ſee what a notable aduantage their fellowes had gotten againſt their enemies, and that all things were ſafe and ſure on their part. It ſeemed they ſtood in feare (as it is often ſeene) of thoſe who were no leſſe affraied of them. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at ſuch time as <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> did depart, the gates were ſpeedily ſet open, and the multitude ranne foorth to ſacke the campe of the Chriſtians, before that the ſouldiers<note place="margin">Belgradians ſacke the camp of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> (who had purchaſed the victorie) could come to ioyne with them in the ſame.

            <p>In the middeſt of theſe and the like ſpeeches, (preſſed forward with conſtraint and<note place="margin">The battell of Belgrade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene Sebalias &amp; Scanderbeg.</note> neceſſitie, which did inuite him to leaue and commit all to the pleaſure of fortune) he caſt himſelfe as a man forlorne and deſperate into the middeſt and thickeſt of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſquadrons, confirming by an aſſured proofe, &amp; beyond all humaine reaſon, that <q>ſaying of <hi>Homer:</hi> That amongſt all other vertues, magnanimitie of courage, is often<note place="margin">Sentence of Homer.</note> accompanied with a kinde of furie and ſupernaturall violence.</q> Thus did <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> fill all places whereſoeuer he came with bloud and terror, ſometimes beating downe thoſe that fled from him, and ſometimes thoſe which did withſtande him: as a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, that was inuincible and moſt fortunate. But if euer his valure did ſhew it ſelfe, it was at this time, when he farre paſſed and excelled all his former deedes and haughtie exploits. The reſt of his troupes likewiſe taking example by his valure, and being tranſported with rage and diſpaire, did breake in vpon the enemie, and ruſhed vppon their weapons, as men blinded and hardened againſt all perils, and followed their Generall through all hazards and daungers.</p>
            <p>But the ſudden accident and miſhappe of <hi>George Thopie,</hi> brother to <hi>Tanuſee,</hi> did<note place="margin">George Thopie his misfortune.</note> put the reſidue in a great feare and aſtoniſhment: for he being throwen to the ground and almoſt ouerwhelmed with the ſhot of the enemie, our men had much a doe to free him out of their handes, and to ſet him on horſe backe. The infanterie of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banois</hi> could better ſaue themſelues from the violence of their enemies then from their horſes: for in many places they made way ouer their bellies, as they lay ouerthrowen vpon the ground, and ſo did put them to great ſcath and miſchiefe. By meanes wherof
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:13368:156"/>
(as there is nothing that doth more awaken the ſpirites of a man, or that doth make<q>
                  <note place="margin">Sentence.</note> him more apt to deuiſe and ſubtillize a thouſand fine inuentions then doth neceſſitie) they did aduiſe themſelues of this policie: to ſeize vpon all the horſes of thoſe which were ſlaine,</q> and which they coulde poſſiblie come by, both of their fellowes and of the <hi>Paynims:</hi> and ſpeedily they mounted vpon them with ſingular agilitie. This was the cauſe that very many of them were preſerued, and it did greatly ſtrengthen the reſt of the armie, for that their forces were by this meanes in a manner redoubled.</p>
            <p>By this time had <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> broken and diſordered a ſtrong troupe of the enemies horſe, and had preſſed in euen to the ſtandard &amp; corps du gard of the Turkiſh General: endeuoring (according to his wonted cuſtome in moſt battels) to haue made the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his victorie by their Chieftains death, &amp; ſo to haue enforced them to yeeld him the honor of that iourney. But euen then at that inſtant thoſe two ſouldiers who (as we haue ſaied) had ſworne his death to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> did aduance themſelues in that front of the fight, and with their ſwords readie drawen did receiue him to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat. At that verie time, and in the ſame place, <hi>Muſache de Angeline</hi> deſiring to ſuccour<note place="margin">Muſache de Angeline wounded.</note> and aide his Vncle, receiued a ſore wound vpon his right ſhoulder: and the reſt of the <hi>Epirots</hi> likewiſe being but fewe againſt many, were ſo plyed and kept doing on all handes, both in front and in flancke, and at their backes, and that ſo fiercely and ſo roundly, that they had no leiſure to looke after their chiefe commaunder, who by meanes thereof being now left alone againſt two (as it were) by a fatall kind of chance and deſtinie, did cauſe eche man to turne and bend their eyes to himwardes. For the two <hi>Mahometans</hi> both with their hands and with their voice putting backe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their companions to retire, would needes by themſelues alone carrie away the<note place="margin">Combat of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>math and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach with Scanderbeg.</note> honour of the death of the Prince of <hi>Albanie:</hi> and they thought to reſerue to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues onely the prize propounded and promiſed them by the <hi>Ottoman.</hi> But it is a<q> common ſaying: That, the foole is greatly deceiued of that he thinketh. Theſe two<note place="margin">A prouer be.</note> Infidels did continue a while coaſting and courſing vp and downe round about him now here, now there,</q> on euerie ſide, to take him at ſome aduantage. In the end eche of them ſetting ſpurres to their horſes, and with a careleſſe contempt of their owne death and daunger, they came vpon him brauely and with a full cariere charged this fierce enemie whom they hated moſt deadly and odiouſly. The notorious valour and notable prowes of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> ſo often tried and approued, did greatly comfort the carefull harts of the <hi>Albanois,</hi> as one whom they had often receiued victorious and triumphant, not of two onely, but of more enemies all at once. <q>Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> as feare maketh men to caſt many doubts; ſo the brauerie of the enemies, and their audacious defie giuen to the Prince of <hi>Epire,</hi> did make many of them to ſuſpect the iſſue of the combat.</q> Wherefore immediately they aduanced forward with their ſquadrons, and whileſt matters ſtood yet in good caſe and entire, they enforced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to their vttermoſt power to ſecond their King againſt his enemies. But he in the meane time bearing vp cloſe to both of them, did reach a full blow to the head of<note place="margin">Barach ſlaine by Scanderbeg.</note> 
               <hi>Barach,</hi> and lighting vpon his face did cut him ouer the eyes, and cleft his head al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in twaine. The other after many blowes paſt betweene them, and no bloud drawen on neither partie, let his ſworde fall out of his hand, and immediately the Turke being verie actiue, preſſed cloſe to him with his horſe, and claſping both his armes about his necke, and forſaking his ſtirruppes and his horſe, with the whole weight of his bodie, he hanged vpon the ſhoulder of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> thinking to haue forced him, and to haue pulled him to the ground together with himſelfe, The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels deſirous to aide their companion gaue in preſently, and enuironned the <hi>Epirot</hi> Prince on all ſides. But their labour was in vaine: for <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> hauing cut off the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:13368:157"/>
heade from his bodie as it did hang vppon him, freed himſelfe from the burthen<note place="margin">Acmath ſlaine by Scanderbeg.</note> of his enemie. You may be ſure, that this acte did notably encreaſe the courage of the Chriſtians, and made them to follow deſperately after their Generall, beating downe great numbers of the Barbarians: who now began to ſhrinke, committing a great and mightie ſlaughter amongeſt them. Theſe beginnings and firſt-fruites of victorie, did miniſter occaſion of much ſorrow vnto the Infidels and vnto the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of great ioy and comfort: and it was taken as a good ſigne and happie token of the returne of their good fortune. But the ſtrength of their bodies, and the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light alſo fayling both the one and the other all alike, they were enforced for that time, to giue place vnto the night. <hi>Sebalias</hi> was the firſt that made ſhew either of his feare that he durſt not, or of his wearineſſe that he could not endure the fight<note place="margin">Sebalias with his armie reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth firſt from the battell.</note> anie longer. Whereupon all his companies, by the commaundement of their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, made cloſe vp to their colours, and ſo retyred themſelues to the mountaine, before that the darkeneſſe of the night ſhould ouertake them in the field. The Prince of <hi>Epyre</hi> being farre ſpent with labour and trauell, and full of griefe and ſorrowe inſupportable, did the like alſo with his armie, ſeizing vpon an other mountaine diſtant about two miles from the enemie. There did he ſtay till it was two houres within night: at which time he diſlodged verie ſecretly, neither him ſelfe nor his<note place="margin">Retrait of Scanderbeg</note> ſouldiers hauing had any refreſhing at all, either of ſleepe or victuals. For (poore ſoules) neither had they any thing to eate, neither had they any deſire thereunto, by reaſon of the extreame griefe and anguiſh of their hearts, which tooke from them all care both of meate and drinke.</p>
            <p>The Baſſa for that night did not enter into the towne, but hauing ſtore of victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alles brought him by the Burgeſſes of <hi>Belgrade:</hi> he lodged his armie, partly in the mountaines, and partly in the ſuburbes. And placing good and ſtrong courts of gard and Sentinelles on all ſides, he celebrated his victorie with great ioy and triumph. For he was perſwaded that the Chriſtians would haue ſtayed there the reſt of the night: and that the next morning freſh and faſting, as men that were not vſed to be beaten, and that would ſeeke to repaire their honour loſt: they would haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentured themſelues to a ſecond battell. Wherefore hauing ſet all things in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and in good order: by the breake of day he deſcended into the playne, ſending foorth many companies to skirmiſh with the Chriſtians, and to drawe them foorth to the fight: for although about two houres in the night he had heard a noyſe, and did diſcerne ſome ſignes, that might ſignifie their departure, yet he did beleeue, that they were remoued onely to ſome other place, where they might eyther reſt more ſecurely, or more commodiouſly dreſſe ſome ambuſcado to entrappe him and his armie. And this alſo was the cauſe that he durſt not ſende foorth his forces to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runne and ſpoile the countrie, doubting leaſt he might thereby diſgrace the honour of this victorie, it being a thing verie vnuſuall with the Turkes to haue ſuch a hand of the <hi>Epyrots:</hi> and beſides the inconſtancie of fortune being an ordinarie chaunce in the warres more then in any other thing whatſoeuer. He was not therefore much diſcontented either with the flight of the Chriſtians, or becauſe he had loſt the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie of fight with them againe: belike he was induced thereunto by an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding iealouzie of this aduantage ſo vnaccuſtomed, and of the good fortune which had befallen him, being deſirous not to looſe it after he had once gotten it. And the<note place="margin">Sebalias his want of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in not purſuing the victory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Albanois.</note> former daies iourney did ſeeme to teſtifie no leſſe, becauſe that he being the firſt that ſounded the retrait, did therein bewray, that either he confeſſed himſelfe to be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and faint harted, as hauing the worſt: or elſe that he was vnwilling to renue the fight: and that he had no great deſire to meddle any more with the enemie.

of the ſhipwracke, to the repairing whereof, himſelfe before time had put to his helping hand, and which many times he had defended &amp; preſerued. And becauſe the fact being odious in it ſelfe would ſeeme much the more diſhoueſt, if he ſhould rebell alone without any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions, he thought he would procure ſome to ioine with him, as his complices and copartners, perſwading himſelfe, that the more there were found guilty &amp; partakers of his treaſon, the more ſhould he both leſſen his own diſgrace and infamy, &amp; it would be a mean alſo that he ſhould preſent him ſelf to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> with the greater countenance, credit and authority, who perhaps would diſdaine him, and not make any great account of him, if he ſhould come alone as a meane fugitiue and ill accompanied. For this cauſe he plotted with him ſelf how to ſeduce ſome of his moſt inward and neareſt friends and familiars, ſuch as he thought fitteſt for that purpoſe. To the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he began with a good countenance firſt to deplore the eſtate of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> and the deſolation of <hi>Epire,</hi> then cunningly did he inſinuat and make known vnto them how the Turkiſh monark did beare him great good loue &amp; liking, what offers he had made him to draw him to reuolt: and with great ſtore of good words did he entiſe them to take his part, &amp; to embarke themſelues in this conſpiracy.

And what reaſon haue we (ꝙ he) to continue and liue euer vnder the fortune of <hi>Scanderbeg?</hi> to what purpoſe ſhould we employ our labor and ſpend our liues to amplifie and enlarge the glory of another? ſeeing the great Monarke of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, will elſewhere beſtow vppon vs great honor, and will giue vs good aſſurance to make vs great, and to aduaunce vs to high authority.</q> In the end with many falſe and ſlaunderous accuſations inueighing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> he alienated them from their allegeance, and allured them to beare a part with him in his rebellion. It may be that he would haue ſollicited many more to reuolt with him, and that he would haue drawen the common people alſo to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion of the <hi>Sultan:</hi> but the name of <hi>Caſtriot,</hi> and the gracious manner of the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſo deeply fixed in the hearts and mindes of all men, that it would haue bene more eaſie for him (as the ſaying is) to ſeparat the ſhadow fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the body, then to aboliſh or to extirpat the loue and good liking of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> which was ſo rooted in the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the communalty: for he well knew that their faith was not ſubiect to any change or variation of fortune, and that their loyalty would neuer faile nor periſh, but with the loſſe &amp; end of their bodies &amp; liues. And therfore the <hi>Dibrian</hi> being in doubt that he ſhould not onely loſe his labour, but he might alſo endanger his owne life and ſafety, he durſt not attempt any ſuch matter: but holding himſelf contented with thoſe conſpirators which he had already gained: after he had prouided all things in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,<note place="margin">Moſes his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture to the enemy.</note> &amp; appointed the houre for their departure, in the dead of the night he lead them to <hi>Sfetigrade</hi> there to take letters and a ſafe conduct from the gouernor, to the intent he might paſſe free throughout the dominions of the Paynims, and ſo trauell forwards to the Court of the <hi>Ottoman.</hi> The Gouernor receiued him louingly, granting him what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he asked, both letters and armed ſouldiers to conuey him ſafely on his iourney.</p>

approued and expert ſouldiers. The artillery that was won from the Chriſtians was left to the towne, except certaine litle peeces, as harguebuſſes and croſſebowes, which he reſerued with the other ſpoiles of the dead bodies to beautifie the pompe of his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, and to preſent them to the king. <hi>Belgrade</hi> being abundantly prouided &amp; defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the Chriſtian hoſtages redeliuered to the citizens, and they alſo highly praiſed &amp; commended: he tooke his leaue of them (who were both fearefull &amp; ſorrowfull for his departure) and with great ioy &amp; contentment he tooke his iorney to <hi>Andrinople:</hi> yet had he alſo iuſt occaſion of griefe &amp; ſorrow to moderat &amp; abate his exceeding ioy (albeit to men who were not accuſtomed to be victorious, nothing ſeemed ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and glorious as this victorie.)

But now I come againe to our fugitiue.</p>
            <p>The morning after the departure of the <hi>Dibrian,</hi> aſſoone as he was found lacking, you may eaſily coniecture, what tumult, ſtirre and aſtoniſhment did ariſe amongſt the<note place="margin">Garriſon of Dibria trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> companies of the garriſon: and how greatly they were grieued, eſpecially thoſe that were his neareſt and moſt familiar friends. They ſought him vp and downe here and there in great care and perplexitie. Some thought that he was ſeeretly gone to eſpy &amp; diſcouer vpon the enemie, and that he was either dead or taken: or if not ſo, that then he would returne ſpeedily. But many being of a deepe conceit and iudgement, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a coniecture by the former conſultations &amp; ſecret aſſemblies of the day laſt paſt, wherein he and others had drawen themſelues aſide in counſell, they did miſtruſt that which was indeed: and their opinion was reputed the more likely and probable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they which were ſuſpected with him, were not to be ſeene at all. This was the occaſion that the <hi>Dibrians,</hi> but aboue all the ſouldiours of the garriſon were in great feare and aſtoniſhment, becauſe they ſaw the enemies to be victorious and yet remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in <hi>Epire,</hi> and themſelues deſtitute of a head and commander. And their griefe was exceeding great, to ſee that their Prince ſhould be deceiued by them, whom he would leaſt of all haue miſtruſted. Neuertheleſſe, according to the time, by publique conſent, and moſt voyces of the ſouldiours, they prouided themſelues of a Chiefetaine, and of all things elſe that ſeemed requiſite for the time preſent.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the moſt noble and chiefeſt young men of the countrey, there were two<note place="margin">Demetrius and Nicholas bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren of the family of the Beriſſians.</note> bretheren <hi>Demetrius</hi> and <hi>Nicholas,</hi> highly commended and honored for the greatnes of their ancient houſe and family of the <hi>Beriſsians,</hi> and they had bene much and often noted to haue done the king of <hi>Epire</hi> good and faithfull ſeruice, by many valiant deeds of armes, and in diuerſe notable aduentures. Theſe two vnderſtanding the misfortune of their army, and the hard iſſue of the ſiege of <hi>Belgrade,</hi> and hauing notice likewiſe of the reuolt of <hi>Moſes,</hi> made with all ſpeede towardes the garriſon in the frontiers of the kingdom, doubting leaſt that either the feare of that ſodaine accident, or the licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſſe of the ſouldiers, ſhould cauſe them to disband themſelues: and ſo the paſſages of the Prouince might be left naked without any defence or cuſtody, eſpecially for that the report went: that <hi>Sebalias Mahomet</hi> his lieutenaunt was yet abiding in the countrey. Firſt of all therefore with good aduiſe and ready debiberation, and with no leſſe diligence, they made a leauy of ſome new forces, and ſtrengthened the garriſon,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:13368:159"/>
heartening and animating them both by words and by deeds, willing them to be of a good courage, and to teſtifie their good affections towardes <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> by ſhewing themſelues his good friends, and their willing deuotion to doe him ſeruice, and with a ſingular compaſſion of their Prince his misfortune, they deteſted and abhorred the infidelity of <hi>Moſes,</hi> telling them, that they doubted greatly, and it was likely he had conueied himſelfe from thence to helpe to bring in the Infidell, and that it would not be long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re he would come thither. All this was eaſily beleeued, &amp; therefore the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were retired into a place of more ſtrength, and all things were ſettled well and in good order, as if they had expected the enemy preſently. Theſe matters being thus eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, <hi>Demetrius</hi> leauing his brother with the garriſon, &amp; being accompanied with certaine Gentlemen <hi>Dibrians,</hi> tooke his way towards <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> making very long and painefull iourneis to aduertiſe him of the eſtate of the <hi>Dibrians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the meane time, certaine ſpies (which had bene purpoſely ſent abroad, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed ouer the plaine countrey) did bring certaine newes, that <hi>Sebalias</hi> was departed from <hi>Belgrade,</hi> and gone away quite out of <hi>Epire:</hi> Howbeit for all that, the Prince of <hi>Epire</hi> either for ſhame or for griefe of his late calamity, being vnwilling to behold ſo vnpleaſing a ſpectacle, had no minde at all to viſite that place ſo odious vnto him, by meanes of that vnfortunate battell, and where he ſhould come but to the freſh view of his misfortunes, and to the renuing of his griefe and ſorrow: neither had he any care or deſire to ſee thoſe who were now dead, whom he could not preſerue and ſaue when<q> they were aliue.

So notably doth the exceeding vehemency of mens paſſions make them many times to forget themſelues, and to decline fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al reaſon and vnderſtanding. Neuertheles becauſe that thoſe which ſhould be ſent to performe that duty of Chriſtian charity vnto others, might not draw on a farther miſchiefe and dammage vpon themſelues,</q> and by their owne deſtruction encreaſe rather then ſolemnize their obſequies, if they ſhould go thither either weake in number or in confuſion, and without order: he made choiſe therefore of 7000. the<note place="margin">Tanuſee ſent with an army to bury the Chriſtians ſlain at Belgrade.</note> beſt &amp; moſt able men of all his bands, that they might be the better able to aſſure them ſelues in their voyage againſt all the enterpriſes of the miſcreants, and to oppoſe them ſelues againſt any ſallies of the <hi>Belgradians.

            <p>By this time was <hi>Tanuſee</hi> come to <hi>Belgrade,</hi> where being diſcouered by the citize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, they bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be in as great a feare as before, &amp; they ran ſpeedily to the wals, euery man haſting to his charge, &amp; to his place that was appointed him: for many thought that he<note place="margin">Tanuſee before Belgrade.</note> was come to begin a new ſiege, &amp; they did not imagin the true occaſion of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: but the ſmalneſſe of his numbers, &amp; the confuſed maner of his marching being more nearly diſcouered and perceiued, they were ſoone freed from that ſudden feare. The <hi>Epirots</hi> coming to the place where the bodies of the Chriſtians their companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s lay ſo mangled and deformed, they could not refraine from many grieuous and bitter teares, at the ſight ofſo horrible and piteous a ſpectacle. And that (which more aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented their griefe and ſorow) was by reaſon of certaine women, who dwelling not far off, followed thither after <hi>Tanuſee</hi> (as the report goeth) to ſearch for ſome of their friends. But it was almoſt impoſſible or very difficult for them to beſtow their teares vpon the right bodies, or to honor the corpſes ofthoſe which they intended. For they were a companie of diſguiſed trunks and carkaſſes, all naked, many without heads, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers disfigured, and their faces ſo corrupted, that they had not only loſt their peculiar ſhape and figure, and were impoſſible to be knowne: but they retained in a maner no ſhew nor reſemblance of humane creatures.

Yet poore ſoules, did they bemoane euerie bodie which they found, taking them for their friends, and neither could the ſtench, nor the corruption ſeparat theſe people from the bodies which they ſo ardently deſired.

And not content therewithall, he proceeded yet further: for paſſing on euen cloſe to the wals (which he might well do without any great danger) he omitted not to do them any dammage, miſchiefe, and diſpleaſure, which his wrath and furie could inflict vpon them.

Whereupon becauſe <hi>Tanuſee</hi> ſtood in doubt leſt the next garriſons of the Turkiſh frontiers might come vpon him, and ſuddenly oppreſſe him, he would not giue anie further attempt againſt them: but with a million of curſes and execrations, he left and abandoned thoſe vnfortunat pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which were ſo infamous by the ruine and ſlaughter of the Chriſtians.</p>

And beſides all priuie and ſecret meanes vſed to enquire of it, there was publike proclamation made with ſound of trumpet, promiſing a great ſumme of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to thoſe that could and ſhould detect any ſuch conſpirators. But there was not found ſo much as any ſhew of ſuſpition of any ſuch matter. And therfore the <hi>Dibrians</hi> were highly commended for their loyaltie, and the aſſured conſtancie of their faith.

            </p>
            <p>Now that I haue laide downe and giuen you a view of the ſituation of the citie, whoſe ſinnes and offences (as it is to be thought) made a ſeparation betwene God and it: It followeth that I now diſcouer vnto you, what order the Turke obſerued in the ſiege thereof both by ſea and land: how he diſpoſed his bandes and companies about it: in what manner he planted his Ordinance and placed his batterie, and how he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his Nauie and ſea forces.</p>
            <p>After the place had beene well viewed, the Turkes did ſoone make their appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches<note place="margin">The manner of the ſiege of Conſtantinople.</note> to the walles, by reaſon the defendants, made but meane reſiſtance, and the aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants being couered with baskets of Oſier, with long plankes and boordes, with targets, pauizes, and ſuch like did march in ſafetie againſt the rampiers with ſo good order and diſcretion, that they would haue made euen the moſt reſolute and expert ſouldiers to be abaſhed and appalled. The Ordinance and ſuch like engines of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie being planted in three ſeuerall places, did beginne to batter the wals as furiouſly as was poſſible: eſpecially towards <hi>Calegarie,</hi> where was placed a Cannon of ſuch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable<note place="margin">Calegarie.</note> greatneſſe, that for the remouing thereof from place to place ſcant 50. yoke of Oxen did ſuffice: and the bullet thereof did containe eleuen handbreathes in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe. Through the violence &amp; diueliſh force of this horrible engine, the wall (though<note place="margin">Conſtantinople battered.</note> it were very large and ſtrongly builded) yet was not able to make reſiſtance: but it fell out that this peece brake, and <hi>Mahomet</hi> commaunded that another ſhould be caſt greater then the former. But it was not ſo ſoone ended by meanes of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and policie of <hi>Calybaſſa,</hi> who was a great friende to a Nobleman a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an<note place="margin">Calybaſſa a friend to the Chriſtians.</note> Baron within the citie, and one of the Counſellors to the Emperour. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the batterie was continued with great ſtore of other artillerie, and they ceaſed not to wearie the defendantes day and night: and dayly did they kill ſome, either more or leſſe with harguebuſſes, arrowes, ſlings, and diuerſe other kindes of ſhot. For the Infidels did imagine, that the defendants were but fewe in number, and that they could not long continue and holde out, nor be able to endure the labour and trauell of the ſiege. And the better to preſſe them to extremitie, and to haue his will of them by force of armes, he laboured with all diligence to digge and caſt vp tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to the intent the ſouldiers might with leſſe paines and daunger ſafegarde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from the enemie, and haue the freer acceſſe to the foote of the wall. Moreouer becauſe he would by the aduantage of the higher place or ground, more eaſily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the ladders to the walles, and be able to carrie the towne, he cauſed a long and high banke of earth, equall to the towne wall to be caſt vp round about that part of the citie: and this was not all, for he cauſed alſo many towers of wood to be raiſed vp neere to the rampiers, from the which (hauing cauſed them to be couered with cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hides) he filled the ditch with earth and other ſtuffe, thinking to leauell and make plaine the way, and to haue the more eaſie acceſſe into the towne. And beſides he had an innumerable companie of logges of wood, of ladders mounted vpon wheeles, and chariots raiſed in forme of caſtels, and ſuch like engines as the <hi>Romaines</hi> themſelues could ſcarce haue found and made the like againſt the <hi>Carthaginians:</hi> and becauſe that monſtrous peece of Ordinance which was newly caſt, could do litle or no hurt at all againſt <hi>Calegarie,</hi> by reaſon of the notable and ſtrong fortification of the place, it was planted neere the port <hi>S. Roman</hi> againſt the tower <hi>Battatinea,</hi> which being beaten<note place="margin">The Port S. Roman. The tower Battatinea.</note> downe to the ground, did with his ruines fill vp the ditch, and made it euen with the height of the plaine ground, inſomuch that the breach was plaine &amp; euen for the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels to haue entred it, but that there was ſpeedie order taken for repairing the ſame, &amp;
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:13368:165"/>
it was made ſtronger then before. Whereat the great Turke greatly maruelling, ſaid: That it was not the worke nor inuention of the <hi>Greekes</hi> but of the <hi>Latines,</hi> who were better practiſed, and more expert and induſtrious in pointes of fortification then the <hi>Greekes.</hi> Thus you ſee what was done towards the firme land.</p>
            <p>Towardes the Sea on that ſide which regardeth <hi>Pera,</hi> the <hi>Sultan</hi> beſieged it with a fleete of 250. ſayle, whereof the greateſt part were Foiſtes, and ſome part gallyes, of which ſome were with two, ſome with three oares on a banke. Beſides there were a great number of Frigats loaden with men and ſhot, rather for a ſhew and terrour vnto them then otherwiſe. Theſe lay at ancker in the maine a good way off, on one ſide of the hauen towards the ſea of Propontide: for they durſt not come neere for feare of the Chriſtians, but lying diſperſed, and ſometimes ſay ling vp and downe the ſea, they did ſtill furniſh their campe at land with wood, ſtones, &amp; ſuch like neceſſaries. The port (as I haue told you) was ſhut vp with a great chaine: and beſides it was garded with 7. great ſhips or carracks of the <hi>Genowayes,</hi> and three of <hi>Creete</hi> or <hi>Candia,</hi> all of them ſtrongly bound &amp; well chained together the one cloſe to the other, ſo as the Turkiſh<note place="margin">A ſtratageme or wonderfull enterpriſe of the Turkes at Conſtantinople (by the counſel of a Chriſtian traitour Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negado) to get into the hauen.</note> Nauie could not poſſibly enter into the harbor. But what did the <hi>Sultan</hi> (thinke you) to get into the hauen? by the counſell &amp; aduiſe of a trayterous wretch a Chriſtian <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negado,</hi> he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded that a certaine number of his gallies ſhould be drawen vp out of the ſea to the mountaine, and then let downe againe on the other ſide into the hauen. The Pyoners and other labourers of the campe being ſet about the worke, and hauing farre and wide on all ſides made plaine the deſcent of the mountaine, both on the one ſide &amp; the other of the promontory of <hi>Metopique,</hi> with ſtrength &amp; force of hands they drew vp the gallies, conueying the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon rollers more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 8. miles in length, &amp; hauing brought them to the top of the mountaine, by litle &amp; litle they let them ſlide faire and<note place="margin">Turkes get into the hauen of Conſtantinople</note> eaſily downe into the hauen. Now imagine you whether this new &amp; ſtrange ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, did not aſtoniſh and amaze the Chriſtians. They ſought by all meanes poſſible to ſinke them with force of great ſtones, or to ſet them on fire, but in vaine did they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it, and thoſe veſſels were the occaſion of great care and trouble vnto them: for that they being enforced by that meanes to quit the defence of the port, neceſſitie did conſtraine them to looke to the defence of the wals towards the ſea ſide, and to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh their gardes on the other ſide towards the land. For the town was daily aſſaulted on that ſide to the ſeaward with a power of 70000. men, by the helpe alſo of another deuiſe which the Turkes inuented as ingeniouſly &amp; with no leſſe hardines, the ſame more terrifying the Chriſtians then the former: the maner wherof you ſhal heare alſo.</p>

            <p>I haue figured foorth vnto you the terrible appreſts and preparations of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Monarch, by which he ſought the ruine and deſtruction of this imperiall citie.

               </gap>de which they had was with muskets and ſuch like ſmall ſhot, with which they could not much greeue nor annoy the enemie, by reaſon of the diſcommoditie of the place, the ſame being couered with trenches, and litle walles drie made, and caſt vp of purpoſe. Of their great Ordinance (as the report goeth) they could haue little or no vſe at all, for feare of ſhaking downe their owne walles; yet ſometimes now and then, they did diſcharge ſome of them vpon the enemie, and did beate downe both men, tents, &amp; pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilions, together with their Pauiſados, Gabions, and other muniments and defences. The braue and furious ſallyes of the youth of the citie, did cauſe the Turks often both to feare and to admire them: and euer the aſſailants had the worſt and ſuſtained great<note place="margin">Courage and valure of the garriſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</note> loſſe in all encounters.

            <p>It happened about that time, that a certaine <hi>Genoway</hi> named <hi>Iohn Iuſtinian,</hi> one of the chiefe of <hi>Genoway,</hi> both for his nobilitie and great account, as alſo for his wealth and riches, did ſcoure the ſeas, and did roaue vp and downe ſeeking his fortune vpon<note place="margin">Iohn Iuſtinian a Genoway made Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Generall for the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour within Conſtantinople.</note> that coaſt with two good and ſtrong ſhippes of warre, and about 400. fighting men.

In regard whereof he had this prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue, to be choſen and allowed for the chiefe commaunder within the towne, and he had the title and name of Lieutenant Generall vnder the Emperour.

The oares of the Gallies flew in ſhiuers, and it was<note place="margin">Flectanella.</note> a horrour to heare the ratling of the hatches, and other great peeces of the ſhipbordes which flew about, beſides the wofull cries and howlings of the Turkes as they gaue vp the ghoſt. Their Soueraigne perceiuing from the mountaine, how his armie was ill beſtead, was in ſuch rage and paſſion as if he would haue runne madde for anger: he curſed and blaſphemed, hee rent his clothes and tore his garmentes, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans they lamented, and all his hoaſt was in amazement and confuſion. What ſhould we ſay more? The broyle was renued, and the fight grew more fierce and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, ſtill the Infidels had the worſt, and ſuch was the ſucceſſe of the fight, that a great number of Turkes being ſlaine and drowned, they were ſcant able for want of men to recouer the ſhore with their ſhipping. The beſieged did learne by ſome of thoſe<note place="margin">Victorie of the Chriſtians in a ſea fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Turks before Conſtantinople</note> which fled whom they tooke priſoners, and by their owne eſpials, that the Turkes had receiued a griuous ouerthrow and diſcomfiture, and that they had loſt more then 10000. of their men. The fleete wherewith they aſſayled the Chriſtian veſſels was very neere of 200<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſayles, part of them being of two, &amp; part of three oares on a banke. The Turkiſh king was greatly confounded, and his forces were reputed of litle or ſmall puiſſance: for that ſo many gallies vnited and conſorted together, were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to take nor ouercome onely three veſſels of the Chriſtians.

            <p>But this mortall enemie of the Croſſe of Chriſt, to the intent he might not leaue any martiall deuiſe vnattempted that might make him Maiſter of the towne, did now bend all his endeuours to winne it ſecretly by ſtealth and ſubtiltie, and by mines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed cloſely vnder the ground, continuing neuertheleſſe daily and hourely the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant<note place="margin">Mynes made by the Turkes againſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, &amp; diſappointed by the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynes of the defendants.

            <p>The <hi>Sultan</hi> perceiuing that the vertue and forwardneſſe of the Chriſtians did cauſe<note place="margin">Diſſimulation of Mahomet purpoſing to deceiue the Chriſtians vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of a peace.</note> all his attempts to turne to ſmoke, beganne now to fall to his wonted byas of cunning and diſſembling.

But his fraude was ſoone perceiued, in that he would not condiſcend, that a fortreſſe which he had raiſed towards the ſea of <hi>Propontide,</hi> ſhould be razed and throwen downe, nor that they ſhould quietly repaire the ruines and breaches of their walles, and of the towers and bulwarkes about the citie. But that which moſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the defendants was, that they could not haue any truſt nor affiance in the worde nor faith of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> who was neuer knowen at any time to haue obſerued his faith<note place="margin">Periurie and ſingular infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie of Mahomet.</note> or othe with any creature liuing; much leſſe was it likely, that he would holde it to his enemie. The worſt of all, was the ſmall number of the defendants which gaue them cauſe of extreame griefe and ſorrow, for they were in all about a 9000. men or litle aboue, as I haue tolde you. But what is one in compariſon of a 1000. For when the defendants were diſpoſed and ordered in their places vpon the walles eche beſide other, they did ſcant ſuffice to furniſh the walles where the enemie had enuironned them both by ſea and by land. The poore Emperour in great confuſion and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, with the teares ſtanding in his eyes, did goe from doore to doore, and from houſe to houſe, imploring and entreating the citizens with his hands ioyned together, that they would aide him with their treaſure and wealth, onely for the waging of more ſouldiers, and for the hyring of ſtrange and forreigne ſuccours. But (ô monſtrous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie, ô wretched auarice of the <hi>Greeke</hi> Nation!) they proteſted and ſwore with moſt execrable othes, that they had not wherewithall to hire any, that they were drawen dry of money by reaſon of the ſcarcetie and miſerie of the time: and yet aftewardes<note place="margin">Auarice and impietie of the Greekes incredible and cauſe of their owne ruine.</note> there was found ſuch abundance of treaſure within the citie, that it ſeemed they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued it to enrich their enemies, who were euen glutted with the exceeding riches which they found hidden there by the citizens. Howbeit ſome few of them of their voluntarie motion did contribute ſomewhat vnto him: but theſe were verie few, and it did him litle pleaſure: yea more then this what did the <hi>Greeke</hi> Emperour? He had recourſe from the citizens, to his Barons, the great Seigniours and chiefeſt nobles of the Empire: but they gaue him counſell in any caſe not to moleſt any man in this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke extreamitie and combuſtion: but rather to take the reliques and other ſacred things and iewelles of the churches, and to ſerue his neede with them.

It was the ſixe and<note place="margin">Cowardize of the Greekes of Conſtantinople</note> twentieth day of Aprill when this crie was publiſhed, the feare whereof cauſed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Greeks</hi> to withdraw and conuey themſelues away: faigning that either they had ſome neceſſarie buiſineſſe to be done in the fieldes, or ſome other occaſion to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelues.

Euery man made prouiſion of neceſſaries to furniſh himſelfe againſt the next dayes ſeruice, which they deſired and expected with ſuch greedineſſe and deuotion, that he was not held for a good man, who did not by his verie countenaunce, and by his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, bewray the heate and forwardneſſe of a braue mind and courageous.

But ſome ſay,</q> that this their abſtinence was enioyned them by the ceremonie of their religion. The day being ſpent, and the night come on, aſſoone as it was ſtarre-light, they fell to feaſting one another with great cheere and notable banquets: drinking and carouſing together for the moſt part of the night. This done they retired themſelues euery man to his quarter to take their reſt, with many louing embracements, kiſſes and mutuall fare-welles giuen to ech other, as if they ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue met againe. You ſee now how the aduerſaries prepared themſelues to the ruine and deſolation of the moſt noble and proud citie of the Orient.</p>
            <p>In the meane while, they within the towne hauing heard of this publique cry and<note place="margin">Citizens of Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtantinople their diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and miſerable eſtate.</note> proclamation of the great Turke, and conſidering the great preparations that were made for the aſſault, ordained a publique and ſolemne proceſſion: the Prieſtes and religious perſons with all reuerence and deuotion had recourſe vnto their reliques, to the image of the crucifixe and of the bleſſed virgin, with deuout prayers, himnes, and ſongs: their eyes ſheading abundance of teares: their hearts ſighing and groaning<note place="margin">Catholique de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion of the Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politanes.</note> for the miſeries and miſchiefes both preſent and imminent vpon them.

As touching the vawmure, it was verie ſtrong and in good eſtate as might be, and it was well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with all things requiſite for the guarding and keeping of it: and accordingly the <hi>Greeks</hi> founding all the ſuertie of their fortreſſe vpon the ſtrength thereof, had lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged all their fighting men betwene the chiefe wall and the vawmure. It was a worke and enterprize of no ſmall importance to couer and furniſh the vawmure with men ſufficient: and therefore many wiſe and expert men of good and ſound iudgement, finding fault and blaming them, did tell them, that they ought not to quit and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the chiefe and maine wall which was high &amp; ſtrong made: for that by the fauor &amp; benefit of the ſame being duely regarded and furniſhed, they might very well haue maintained and defended the other wall, and ſo haue drawen out the ſiege at length. But if the Emperour for his part did make any default by reaſon of his negligence and puſillanimitie which I will not ſpeake of: much more were they to be blamed, who had the chiefe managing and gouernment of the eſtate, namely, <hi>Emanuell Gregare</hi> (who was a litle before but a very begger and baſe fellow,) and one <hi>Neophit</hi> a Monke<note place="margin">Emanuell Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare, Neophit a monke, two pillers and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the ſtate of Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> of <hi>Rhodes:</hi> two moſt notable pillers and not pillours of the common wealth.

Faine would they haue remedied this miſchiefe afterwardes, but then it was all too late: for they wanted two of the moſt neceſſary and principall things to effect it: to wit, time and money, both which they might haue remedied with great eaſe and facility, if they had intended it either with oportunity or any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity at ſuch time as they ſaw the burthen of the warres euen readie to fall and light vpon their ſhoulders. But the malice or the negligence of that people, did put off and deferre all things from time to time, and from day to day, till it came to ruine and deſtruction. Now by reaſon that the <hi>Greekes</hi> did put their whole truſt and confidence in their vtter ditches and the vawmure: when thoſe were once loſt, and that they were forced to retire within the maine wall, which before they neglected, they were not able in the end neither to man it nor to defend it.

Vppon theſe difficulties, <hi>Caly Baſſa</hi> the moſt auncient and ſageſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> a man of notable experience in the warres, and one that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Caly Baſſa counſelleth Mahomet to raiſe the ſiege from Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople.</note> fauoured the Chriſtians (though in ſecrete) and had continually diſſwaded the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi> from perſiſting in this enterpriſe: in a ſolemne aſſembly which was now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led purpoſely to conſult vppon this point, he told the <hi>Sultan:</hi> That it could not but be very perillous and daungerous for him to vrge the city of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> any longer, the ſame being of notable ſtrength and aboundantly prouided of all things for the warre, and furniſhed with good ſtore of ſouldiers hardy and reſolute either by death or life to defend their liberty: That his aunceſters in times paſt had often, but in vaine aſſaied to conquer it, and were euer repulſed: And which was moſt worthye to be conſidered, that he was not to make any doubt, but that all the Princes and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of <hi>Europe,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the <hi>Genowayes</hi> his next neighbours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aduertiſed of the neceſsity and extremity of the towne, would preſently come with a braue and ſtrong power to ſuccour it: That he ought to beware how he did incenſe them and make thoſe his enemies, who were able in other places eyther

Of all military actions and martiall ſeruices, either in field or fortreſſe, there is none more terrible, none more fearefull, bloudy or cruell, then to maintaine a breach againſt reſolute and hardy aſſailantes, it being an ordinary thing in that caſe, for men to ſtand and fight vppe to the knees in bloud, death and wounds attending them on all ſides: yet muſt you not recule, nor be diſcouraged, when you ſhall ſee your Captaines, your kinſmen or your friends, dying and yeelding vp their ghoſts at your feet: but perſiſting reſolutely &amp; with vndaunted hearts, you muſt hold out againſt the enemy as long as any one of you is left aliue. If any of you haue that miſtruſt of your ſelues, that you cannot finde in your hearts to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide the ſight of the ſlaughter, withdraw your ſelues a Gods name to ſome other part of the walles, that you may be there emploied about ſome other needefull occaſions, wherein alſo your ſeruice ſhall be very acceptable: for all men cannot be equally and alike reſolute. You haue had ſufficient triall of the fury and forces of your aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for theſe 52. daies wherein you haue bene beſieged, and you haue no reaſon now at this preſent to be more terrified or aſtoniſhed, then you haue bin heretofore, for they are the ſame men ſtil that you haue found them in the former fights. You are not now to fight for a petty village: for ſome ſmall caſtell of litle price or reckoning, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you haue litle or nothing to looſe: but you fight for the church of God &amp; his holy religion: for the honor &amp; ſafety of the ſacred Empire: for your own natiue towne and countrey, the chiefe, principall, and Imperiall city of the world: wherein your wiues, your children, your parents, your friends, and all your chiefeſt and deareſt treaſures, do come running vnder the ſhelter of your armes both behind and before you, and on all ſides, imploring your vertue, your valour, and extreameſt reſolution for their defence and ſafety, which without your deuoire will be vtterly loſt and deſtroied, and euen in a moment come to ruine &amp; confuſion. What a deſolation ſhould we ſe if theſe barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous miſcreants, ſo couetous and thirſty of the bloud of Chriſtians, who haue ſworne to put all to the ſword, ſhould come and ſtrew your faire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſtreets, and fill vp your ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous houſes with dead bodies and carkaſſes? how lamentable a ſpectacle would it be to ſee ſo many wiues, maidens, and yong infants violated? the beautifull temples buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the piety and deuotion of the Chriſtians our fore-fathers now to be polluted, burned, and deſtroied? The only way to auoide theſe miſchifes is to goe againſt theſe hell hounds reſolutely: to oppoſe our ſelues againſt them manfully, and to ſet aſide all feare of danger, and all care and reſpect of death, which though we could ſhun for the time preſent, yet in the end will it be ſure to make an end of vs all without exception.</q>

            <p>Immediatly vpon this exhortation, the whole aſſembly with a ſetled &amp; fierce coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,<note place="margin">Aſſault to Conſtantinople by the Turkes.</note> did vow &amp; promiſe that they would all die before they would do otherwiſe: and ſo encoraging ech other, they followed their Generall to the ſeuerall places where it pleaſed him to appoint them: and there with good deliberation did they attend the time of the aſſault. It was not long ere they heard the Infidels preparing their artillery and other engins, &amp; drawing of their chariots with their caſtels or turrets vpon them with their ladders vpon wheeles, their towres of wood, and ſuch like inſtruments for the aſſault: and in an inſtant the Turkiſh army to the ſeaward did enuiron the Port &amp; the wals on that ſide: for you muſt note that preſently after midnight, the Turks vpon a hope &amp; greedines of the prey, being vnpatient to ſtay and attend the breaking of the day, did preſent them ſelues in armes before the walles, and began the fight whileſt it was yet darke, continuing the ſame euen till it was day: But they were ſo plied with
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:13368:171"/>
ſtones &amp; ſhot from aloft, that they were not able in the obſcurity of the night, to keepe themſelues out of the danger of the defendants, ſo that fighting ſtill with great diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, they caried away nothing but ſhame and infamy, with the loſſe of infinite of their braueſt and fierceſt ſouldiers. The light of the day hauing chaſed away the ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light: <hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelfe came forth with the ſtrength of his army, and after he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the ſignall to begin the aſſault, he commanded that <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Pera</hi> ſhould be attempted both together and at one inſtant, becauſe the <hi>Greekes</hi> ſhould not ſuccour ech other: himſelf alſo appointed euery Colonell with his regiment to a certaine ſpace and quantity of the wall, to the intent that euery one of them being to fight ſeuerally, and in the place particularly aſſigned vnto him, both the valour and proweſſe of them that deſerued and did beſt, ſhould be more apparant and manifeſt, and by the emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of praiſe and glory they might the more animate each other in the conflict. With the like counſell and aduiſe were the companies of the ſea army diſtributed in order, with an expreſſe charge &amp; commandement, that euery one ſhould make his approch in the quarter appointed vnto him at one and the ſame time. In this maner the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers being diſpoſed and marſhalled both on the one ſide and the other, the aire reſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the noiſe of trumpets, drums, and cornets, to incenſe them that fought, the fury of the aſſault began to encreaſe, and to be renued ſtill more and more, continuing with great aboundance of bloud and cruelty. The Pagans bending their bodies, and ſhrinking in their heads, did couer them ſelues with their targets and pauiſhes, and ſo marching on roundly preſented their ladders to the walles, and with an exceeding au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacity ſtriued to get vp, and to mount vpon the rampiers which had bene newly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded &amp; repaired. The defendants receiued them as coragiouſly, beſtowing vpon them great heapes and plenty of ſtones, pots, bals, and launces of wilde fire, ſcalding oile, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing water, and ſuch like: powring downe alſo vpon them a whole ſhower of ſhotte, darts, and arrowes, and neuer ceaſing to ouerturne the ladders, and to tumble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the top downe to the bottome. In the meane time they which preſented themſelues to the breach with the pikes in their hands, were likewiſe valiauntly reſiſted by others, who preſsing brauely forward &amp; ruſhing vpon them, did not ſtrike in vaine: but bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe innumerable Infidels, ſome ſlaine, ſome maimed, they ſcattered that batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion: hauing giuen them ſuch entertainment, that many being left dead vpon the place<note place="margin">Turks repulſed from the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault.</note> were made ſure for euer aduenturing themſelues againe in the like hazard: and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue of the Turkes (as men that could do no good, and whoſe former heate was well cooled) did now ſeeme to deſire to be diſpenſed withall, that they might not for that day returne any more to ſo bad a banquet, and they began to retire themſelues the ſame way they came. Then <hi>Mahomet</hi> enraged with ire and madnes went to meete and to encourage them, and he called ſometimes to one, ſomtimes to another by their names, eſpecially ſuch as were men of marke and chiefeſt eſtimate. Some he conſtrained by menaces, others he perſwaded by promiſes, and did ſo much preuaile, that he made<note place="margin">Aſſault renued at Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met to the Turkes.</note> them to take part againe, and thereuppon they reenforced the aſſault: then might you haue ſeene ſome climing vpon their fellowes backes, other creeping vp like cats, and making themſelues way vp to the wals: againſt the pikes of their enemies, many alſo marching cloſe together and in troups vnder the couerture of their targets, &amp; bearing downe their heads, hauing gained the foote of the wall, did mount to the tops of their ladders: &amp; then with the one hand they labored to lay hold vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the enemies weapons, &amp; with the other graſping cloſe by the battlements, they ſtriued to get aloft vpon the wals, &amp; there to haue raiſed the Turkiſh enſignes. But the promptnes, vigor, &amp; hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the defendants, did far exceed the atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pts of the aſſailants, ſtil beating them down and ouerthrowing them in infinite numbers with pikes, ſtones, and other weapons,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:13368:171"/>
and with caſting of boyling pitch vppon them. It was a braue ſight to ſee how <hi>Iohn</hi>
               <note place="margin">Induſtry and vertue of Iohn Iuſtinian.</note> 
               <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> with his ſword in his hand, &amp; accompanied with a ſquadron of armed men, now here, now there, did with might and maine beare in vpon the enemy, where as he ſaw them thickeſt, ſtill ouerthrowing and diſperſing them where ſoeuer he came. One while would he redreſſe and confirme the rancks where he ſaw them to faile or to moue: another while with a watchfull eie and ſpeedy pace, would he giue and ſend ſuccours where they needed, and both with the valour of his hand, aſwell as with the eloquence of his ſpeech, he encouraged them on all parts both to do well and to hope well. The preſence of the Turkiſh Monarch did no leſſe further the obſtinacy &amp; reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of his people, both by often exhortations and continuall ſupplies of newe and freſh troups who ſucceded chearfully in the places of thoſe which were either ſlaine or repulſed, not ſuffering the defendants to haue any leiſure to reſt or to breath the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, although they performed their deuoire &amp; duty beyond all reaſon &amp; humaine power: yet by reaſon that their nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers were ſo ſmall, it could not be but they ſhould at length be driuen to the laſt point and exigent of all extremity. Neuertheleſſe they ſtill ſhewed them ſelues in countenance and outward appearance reſolute and deliberate, and that they feared no perill whatſoeuer. In this eſtate did they mainetaine themſelues conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſtout and vnuanquiſhed, not ſuffering the aſſailantes to glory or to boaſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of any aduantage againſt the towne, vntill ſuch time as their Chieftaine and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> (by the permiſsion of the cruell deſtinies which nowe beganne to contrary this miſerable and wretched city) in the heate and fury of the fight, &amp; where the wall was moſt endangered, whileſt he oppoſed him ſelfe moſt ſtoutly againſt the enemy, with a company of braue and gallant men, prodigall &amp; careleſſe of their liues, moſt vnhappily receiued a wound behinde vnder the arme hole, being ſhotte with an arrow by one of the defendants ſtanding within vpon the walles.</p>
            <p>Behold now a ſtrange caſe and a wonderful: He which of late by the only terror of<note place="margin">Iohn Iuſtinian wounded and fainteth, forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his charge</note> his name did appall his enemies, and did adde a corage and confidence vnto the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: he which ſhewed himſelfe as a ſecond <hi>Mars,</hi> and with his arme all bloudy euen to the elbow, did flie like a tempeſt amongſt the Turkiſh ſquadrons, preparing the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory for the <hi>Greekes,</hi> now alas onely 3. or 4. drops of bloud diſtilling from his owne body, did put him quite out of heart, and as one vtterly forlorne he fainted and gaue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, forgetting al his former glory, the remembrance of his duty, and the ſafety both of himſelfe &amp; his countrey. For perceiuing his wound to bleed much, he withdrew him ſelfe ſecretly out of the preſſe, &amp; remoued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the place without ſpeaking euer a word, going into the towne to haue his wound dreſt, being vnwilling (as himſelf afterwards confeſſed) to haue a ſurgeon called thither: for feare leaſt his ſouldiers, who were then fighting with great fury in that place, ſhould be partakers of his feare, &amp; ſo be diſcora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by his miſhap. Thus whileſt he thought to auoide one inconuenience he tumbled into a greater miſchiefe. The Emperour hearing of his departure, and ſuppoſing that his abſence would be the loſſe of the towne, as his preſence had bene the preſeruation<note place="margin">Emperour of Greece his ouerſight.</note> of the ſame, did commit a ſecond diſorder worſe then the former: for without leauing any man of marke or reckoning to ſupply his office, or to commaund in his place, he went himſelfe in perſon and followed after him to cal him backe againe, endeuouring to cauſe him to returne. But <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> more deafe then a Haddocke, and obſtinate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all reaſon, or rather tranſported with extreame feare, coulde not be entreated by any prayers or perſwaſions to tarry and abide: but cauſing the gate of the city to be opened for him, he promiſed that as ſoone as his wound was dreſſed he woulde returne incontinent. All the gates and portes of the city by which men ſhould paſſe through from the vawmure into the towne, were cloſed and barred vppe, becauſe
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:13368:172"/>
all waies, and hope of retrait being taken from the ſouldiours, euery man ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine either to vanquiſh the enemy or to die with honour. But what followed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon<note place="margin">The Chriſtians diſcomforted and out of hart vpon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of their Generall.</note> this accident? The Chriſtians which were at the breach, as ſoone as they had loſt the ſight of their Generall, began to looſe courage likewiſe and to be out of heart. Then might you haue ſeene ſome of them make haſt to retire, and to withdrawe them ſelues out of the preſſe: others began to fight more ſlowly and laſily, and at laſt all in generall beginning to faint and to deſpaire, betooke them ſelues to a <q>ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ignominious flight. Whither do you flie you poore and ſenſleſſe wretches? doth your ſafety now conſiſt in your heeles? what, doth your reſolution depend on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vppon one man ſo fraile and mortall? If your walles be loſt haue you any other by which you may be couered and protected? or will you returne againe into the wombes of your mothers there to hide you from your enemies? Are you ignorant, or haue you forgotten it, that theſe barbarous miſcreants are ſo mercileſſe and cruell, that they haue no reſpect of ſexe nor age: and that their faſhion is to deuour and ſwallow vp all ſortes and degrees of perſons in one and the ſame gulfe of vnſpeakea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble miſchiefe without all pity and compaſſion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Colonels and Captaines of the Turkes ſeeing the countenance of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; as ſoone as they perceiued them to faint and wauer, they encouraged their ſouldiours, and with high clamours animated them on to ſcale the walles, which were in a manner quite forſaken and abandonned. Then the Infidelles (who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready deuoured in hope the rich promiſes of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and were greedy of reuenge for the loſſe of their bretheren, friendes and fellowes, that lay ſlaine before their eies<note place="margin">Conſtantinople taken by the Turkes.</note> in the ditches of the towne:) they began to preſſe forward in good and cloſe array, and with greater feruency and violence then at any time before. Some of them forced through the breaches, others by their ſcaling ladders got ſpeedily to the toppe of the rampiers, and in a moment made them ſelues maiſters both of the ſecond or vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt wall, and of the rampiers and bulwarkes thereof, chaſing thence the <hi>Greeke</hi> ſouldiours: who being now quite diſcomfited ſought to ſaue them ſelues by flying into the towne, through that gate which was lately opened to <hi>Iuſtinian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this diſarray and foule confuſion, the Emperour alſo forgot him ſelfe and his duety, which was to haue held good, and to haue died with his armes in his handes. But he becauſe he would not fall aliue into the handes of the Infidelles, turned his backe likewiſe moſt ſhamefully, and holding company with the reſt that fled, as he<note place="margin">Emperour of Conſtantinople ſmoothered in a throng by his owne ſubiects, flying from the Turkes.</note> ſtriued to enter in at the city gate in the middeſt of the preſſe and throng, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded no more then a priuate perſon, hee was borne downe forcibly to the ground, troden and trampled vnder foote, and ſo moſt miſerably ſmoothered. It is a ſtrange thing and worthy to be obſerued, that in ſo great a feare and confuſion, amongeſt ſo great a multitude of ſouldiers and valiant men, onely two were found and no more, who contemning the preſent perill and all feare of death, did ſtoutly oppoſe their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as a bulwarke for the defence and for the ſafety of their countrey: and preferring religion before life, and an honourable renowme before their priuate ſafety, did euen vow and conſecrate them ſelues to the death, fighting valiantly euen to the laſt gaſpe.<note place="margin">The death and honourable end of Theophilus Paleologus and Iohn of Sclauony.</note> The one of them was <hi>Theophilus Paleologus</hi> the Emperours kinſeman: the other was <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Sclauony,</hi> a man otherwiſe of a meane and ſeruile condition, but in his end no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and honourable.

            <p>The Turkes hauing wonne the Vawmure, chaſed the Chriſtians towardes the towne: and entring the port, pell mell together with them, they ſlue of <hi>Greekes</hi> and <hi>Latines</hi> about an eight hundreth within the gate. From the body of the Emperor (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found and knowen by of his coate armour) they did cut off the head, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened it vpon a pike, carying and ſhewing it vp and downe for a token and ſigne of victorie, whileſt others in the meane time hauing gotten to the top, and gayned the chiefe and maine wall of the Citie, with ſhot, arrowes, ſtones, and ſuch like, chaſed thence the citizens: who hearing the alarme at the gate ranne thitherwards, thinking to haue ſhut it, and to haue made a Barricado to keepe the enemie from entring. But the gate being alreadie wonne, and the walles now voyde of defence, the infidels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came maiſters of the towne, exceedingly triumphing, both for the conqueſt of the place, and for the infinite riches and treaſures which they found there ineſtimable. The furie and the victorie of the ſouldiers was ſoone and eaſily to be diſcerned by the cryes and howlings of thoſe whom at the firſt entrie they beat downe to the ground, killing and cutting in peeces all thoſe whom they encountred with armes on their backes or weapon in hand. After the furie and heate of the ſlaughter was ſomewhat appeaſed, they gaue them ſelues on all parts to prey and pillage, ranſacking the towne<note place="margin">Conſtantinople ſacked with all horrible exceſſe of villanie for three dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</note> of all things with extreme rapine and greedineſſe: and after the ſack was ended what Iliads are able to recount the particulars of the infinite diſorders, exceſſe, villanies, and enormities, which that barbarous, impious, and infamous people, addicted to all vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſſe, auarice and crueltie, did dare to exerciſe vpon the wretched and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable inhabitants? O how pitifully and horribly were they forced and violated, no ſexe nor age being ſpared or pardoned! they confounded and intermingled murthers with whoredomes, and whoredomes with murthers, greedily ſeeking to ſatisfie their brutiſh and vnſatiable humour of lecherie, whereunto that nation of all others is extremely and mightily giuen ouer and enclined. They ſhamed not to put in irons as well the old men who were decrepit for age, as the young lads and tender maidens whom the fortune of the towne had reſerued aliue: whom alſo being coupled and chained together, they draue before them with great deſpite and deriſion. And if by chaunce there happened any maiden, woman, or young boy, any thing beautifull and comely to looke on: euerie man ſtriued who ſhould haue them to abuſe them in moſt villanous and ſhamefull maner: which was an occaſion alſo, that many times they would like brute beaſtes one kill another. The like alſo would they do when they lighted vpon any bootie that was of great value, were it either ſacred or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane: for ſo many would ſet hand on it together, that oftentimes they would mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther each other for the ſame. And by reaſon that their armie was compound of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe nations, differing in language and in manners, there was no kinde of villanie or impietie (how hatefull and enormious ſoeuer it were) but it was ſuffered to the ruine and extreme deſolation of this miſerable citie.

The images of the crucifixe and of the Saints, were either trailed through the dirt, or broken in peeces with axes and hatchets.

What notable and extreme torments did they inflict vpon the ſeruants of priuate particular men, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine them to reueale and diſcloſe their maiſters goods and hidden treaſures?

            <p>The ſeaſon and time of the yeare, which now beganne to grow more milde and<note place="margin">Scanderbeg prepareth to receiue Moſes in Epire.</note> temperate, the frequent and often renued aduertiſements, and the rumour publiſhed and ſpread abroad concerning the approch of <hi>Moſes</hi> into <hi>Epyre</hi> did perwade the king to haue his forces in a readineſſe. Wherefore with a notable good courage and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, he attended the comming of this new enemie, howbeit with a more milde af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and leſſe hatred, then he vſed towards others that came in armes againſt him. He could not yet let it ſinke into his minde, that the <hi>Dybrian</hi> did beare him any ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, or did carrie the minde of an enemie towardes him, or that ſo ſlight, or rather no occaſion, ſhould cauſe ſo ſuddaine and great a chaunge of his faith and fidelitie, which had bene notably tryed and approued in ſo manie battelles and for ſo manie yeares. He thought rather that it might be, he vſed this as a cunning ſtratageme and policie, to leaue ſome teſtimonie to the poſteritie of his great renowme, and for the confuſion and grieuous ruine of the Miſcreants. And although it were ſo that he marched as an open and apparant enemie againſt his countrie, yet was he in good hope, that the ſight of his natiue ſoyle, and the preſence of his auncient friendes and fellow citizens would by litle and litle drawe him to a more charitable and friendly reſpect, and ſo aboliſh all his enmitie and ſiniſter affections earſt conceiued againſt his Prince or countrie. But howſoeuer it was he had his army in good order, and in a readineſſe againſt all hazards and euents: being fully reſolued, either with armes in hand to vnderſtand the mind and intention of his friende, or with a moſt ſharpe and ſetled courage and indignation to fight with him as his open enemie. Neither did he greatly care to proceed againſt him with any policies and ſtratagemes to ſurpriſe him vpon the way, becauſe he knewe well that his troupes were not exceſſiue great, nor much exceeded his owne forces, but that both in number and valure they were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to receiue him, and to hazard the fortune of the field with him. And it may be alſo that he held it no eaſie matter, nor of ſmall daunger to allure or drawe him into his ſnares, who was an old and expert arts maſter in ſuch ſleights and ſubtilties, and ſuch an enemie as had bene familiarly acquainted with his manner of gouernement and proceedings in martiall ſeruices.</p>
            <p>This then was the occaſion, that <hi>Moſes</hi> entred free and without any diſturbance<note place="margin">Moſes entreth into the lower Dibria to Oro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichea or the fields of Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalia.</note> into the lower <hi>Dybria</hi> and encamped in <hi>Epyre</hi> neere to the plaine of <hi>Oronichea,</hi> which hath beene ſo famous for ſo manie great and notable victories, eſpecially through the defaite of <hi>Muſtapha:</hi> yet did not he attempt anie thing eyther by procuring the inhabitantes to reuolt vnto him, or to ſpoyle and waſte the countrie in anie cruell and hoſtile manner. For he was aduertiſed, that the King of <hi>Epyre</hi> did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and hauing a deſire and determination to beginne the warre with a priuate and ſingle combat betweene himſelfe and <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> bodie to bodie: he thought it more meete and conuenient to proceede with open force in plaine and ſet bartell, then by trifling skirmiſhes, or by roades and inuaſions to waſte, ſpoyle, and ſacke the Prouince. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> made no long delay, but meeting with him euen in the
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:13368:176"/>
open and plaine champion, he made readie his forces to the conflict. Immediatly beganne a great murmuring in the army, and the ſouldiers in a certaine diſdaine and deſpight to ſee him, could hardly be reſtrayned vnder their enſignes, but that they would forthwith haue charged vppon the enemie. Euen as a kinde and naturall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when he ſeeth his owne ſonne ſtanding and behauing him ſelfe inſolently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him (whom a damnable deſire of rule, and a wilde youthfull diſpoſition, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient<note place="margin">An elegant compariſon.</note> of the yoake hath drawen into armes againſt him) is then loaden and ſurchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with care and griefe, and euerie moment doth temporize and ſeeke delayes, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching forwarde but ſlowly, and ſeeketh firſt (though in vaine) by ſweete wordes and perſwaſions to conuert and diſſwade him from his obſtinate and diſobedient courſe, deferring as long as he can, the puniſhment of him whom he loueth ſo dearely, and is loath to triumph in the lamentable victorie of his owne bloud and bowels: euen ſo the King of <hi>Epyre</hi> preſſed on with loue and pietie, did looke vppon <hi>Moſes</hi> then in armes, and furiouſly raging againſt him, did iudge diuerſely of his minde and affection. Willingly he would haue demaunded a word, and haue had ſome ſpeech with him, and he would gladly haue ſounded the nature and diſpoſition of his olde friend, wherewith he had beene ſo familiarly acquainted; or elſe he would haue treated with him by Ambaſſadours and friendly counſels: But neither the Maieſtie of his royall eſtate and dignitie, nor the rigour and ſeueritie of armes, nor the furie and inſolencie of the ſouldiers (who were now readie to skirmiſh and to beginne the fight) would permit and ſuffer him to doe any of theſe thinges, whileſt they were more deſirous, that his fault ſhould reſt betweene God and his owne conſcience, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the enemy ſhould thinke they ſtood in any doubt or feare of him. But <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> his mind ranne on no ſuch matter: his thoughts tended to another end: for he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring himſelfe to put that in performance, which he had earſt promiſed to the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Monarche was in a mind preſently to haue giuen the onſet vpon the enemie, had not the prompt audacitie and hardineſſe of <hi>Ahimaz</hi> a priuate ſouldier, interrupted<note place="margin">Ahimaz.</note> and deferred for a while that his purpoſe and enterpriſe: for this Turke addreſſing him ſelfe towardes the <hi>Dybrian</hi> ſayd,</p>

It ſeemeth vnto me (I know not how) an vnfit thing, and nothing agreeable vnto the right vſe of armes, that we ſhould come abruptly to trye the fortune of all our forces in a pitched and maine battell, and not to beginne the fight by ſome ſmall and light attempt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The deſire of this ſouldier was ſoone approued, and he was permitted to arme himſelfe for the combat, and withall to ſend a trumpet to the King of <hi>Epyre,</hi> to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his pleaſure, if he would conſent that before the beginning of the fight, both the one part and the other ſhould make tryall in this manner of their valure and good fortune. The trumpet being ſeene to approach, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> did imagine (according as he wiſhed) that the <hi>Dybrian</hi> would haue drunke water with his wine: but when he vnderſtoode the ſumme of his meſſage, the name and regard of <hi>Moſes</hi> beganne by litle and litle to vaniſh out of his remembrance: neuertheleſſe that which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded was accorded vnto him. But ſome of the <hi>Epyrots</hi> (as the report goeth) made this anſwere: That if the Turkes would, they were and would be readie by a priuate and particular combat of ſome fewe perſons, to exempt the two armies from the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill and hazard of a ſet fielde. Thus at the ſame time, that the Trumpet on the one ſide did retyre with his anſwere to the Turkiſh armie, on the other ſide one of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirot horſemen, <hi>Zacharie Groppe</hi> being followed with the clamours of thoſe of his
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:13368:176"/>
owne companie came forth very couragiouſly and in very great haſte preſented him<note place="margin">Zachary Grop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe deſireth leaue to fight the combat with Ahimaz.</note> ſelfe to his Prince, deſiring him to giue him the honour and preferment of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> receiued him very courteouſly, and with very good ſpeeches high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended and magnified his vertue. His companions that helped to arme him prayed vnto God to giue him, not more ſtrength and valure, nor more hardineſſe or courage, but onely the fortune and good happe of <hi>Maneſſey.</hi> He made choiſe of no other then his ordinarie and vſuall weapons: onely he wore vpon his armour certaine rich ornaments as is the guiſe of ſouldiers. The <hi>Paynim</hi> who was in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inferiour to his aduerſarie, was the firſt that tooke the fielde, imagining that there ſcant durſt anie man come to encounter him: but aſſoone as he ſawe the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (with whom he ſhould haue to deale) to come into the fielde throughly armed, and with his launce vpon his thigh marching right towardes him, he addreſſed him ſelfe vnto him, and cryed all aloft: Soft and faire, ſoft and faire (quoth he) noble<q>

And therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all he entreated him,</q> that they might talke together, and hauing enquired the name and the degree or eſtate of the <hi>Epyrot,</hi> he beganne to propound certaine conditions not much vnlike thoſe which once were propounded and ſcorned by <hi>Paul Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſey,</hi> in the like action. Whereunto <hi>Zacharie,</hi> interrupting his ſpeeches as vaine and friuolous, replyed, That he could wiſh with all his heart, that he had more and <q>better meanes to content his deſire: and (if it were his fortune) to make his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the more glorious. This ſaide, ech of them turned about and withdrewe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues apart,</q> and being gone ſo farre, that the full courſe of their horſes might make<note place="margin">Combat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Ahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz and Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary Groppe.</note> their ſtroakes the more violent, ſetting ſpurres to their horſes, and giuing them the reynes, they tooke their carreer eche againſt other with their launces in the reſt. Neither of them fayled in their courſe, notwithſtanding their ſtrokes were in vaine, for that their launces piercing into their targets, which were couered with barres of ſteele, did flie in peeces without any hurt done vnto their bodies: yet they hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on their carreer, encountred together with their bodies ſo rudely, that both horſe and men tumbled to the ground. The two champions yet whole and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wounded, ſpeedily got vp vppon their feete, and leauing their horſes, with their ſwords drawen did affront ech other, and beganne a fierce and cruell conflict. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune would that the ſight of this combat ſhould be diuerſely enriched and beautified, imparting her fauour equally vnto them. For hauing continued a long time in fight, and no bloud drawen on neither ſide, their ſwordes fell out of both their handes: it might be long of the crookedneſſe and heauineſſe of their Cimitaries, which are fitteſt for horſemen, and leſſe eaſie for them that fight on foot: or peraduenture it was by reaſon of wearineſſe, or for lacke of aduiſement, and through their ouermuch heat and haſtineſſe in fighting. Hauing loſt their ſwords, they did caſt away their targets alſo, and (as two ſtrong and mightie wraſtlers vnarmed) with their bare handes, they faſtened eche on others bodie, doing their beſt and worſt by wraſtling to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe ech other. The two hoaſtes ſtood and behelde them, with equall and like meaſure both of hope and feare. After they had thus a long time wraſtled and tug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged together, reſting themſelues nowe and then among: and neither of them able to moue or to force, and throw ech other to the ground, they came at length to the laſt proofe of their force and ſtrength, and lifting vp one the other from the earth, they tumbled and fell both of them together, the Turke vnderneath with his belly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, and the Epirot full vpon him, who very quickly and nimbly ſetting hande on his dagger, ſtabbed him with it into the throate. <hi>Ahimaz</hi> by little and little beganne to waxe faint, and his handes leauing their holde, the vanquiſher (hauing

And being thus loaden with that and his other ſpoyles, he went his way faire and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily towardes his fellowes who were comming to meete him. For you muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that both their horſes at the beginning of the combat, were gotten and fled to the campe of the Chriſtians, which the common ſort interpreted as a good token of their victory and good fortune. <hi>Zacharie</hi> had no leſſe recompence and rewards giuen him by <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> then <hi>Maneſsey</hi> had before for the like deſert; but the praiſes and commendations giuen him by the whole army farre exceeded, becauſe both the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and the variety of the combat did ſeeme to amplifie the merit of the champion, and did more adorne and beautifie the honour of the victorie.</p>
            <p>This good happe hauing giuen vnto the Chriſtians an aſſurance and entry to the entier fauour of fortune, and hauing put <hi>Moſes</hi> in a maruellous anguiſh and griefe of heart (notwithſtanding that his troupes being terrified with the ill ſucceſſe of their companion did diſſwade him by all meanes poſſible) yet he giuing the ſpurres to his<note place="margin">Moſes challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat.</note> horſe, &amp; galopping ouer the field (as yet ſmoaking with the bloud of the Turks) went apart towards <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> and with a high voice challenged him to the combat. The ſuddenneſſe and ſtrangeneſſe of the act did aſtoniſh and amaze all the <hi>Epyrots,</hi> and they did with a kind of horror, deteſt the noueltie and rareneſſe of ſo wicked and inſolent an action: inſomuch as they ſtood ſtill as men ſtricken mute or dumbe with that acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. As yet was not all loue and pietie quite baniſhed &amp; exiled out of the heart of the king of <hi>Albany:</hi> but ſtanding for a time in doubt and mammering with himſelfe, he was loth to defile his hands with the bloud of his old friend &amp; familiar: but the other perſeuering in his importunate defiance, and withall vpbraiding him in moſt iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and deſpightfull manner, it made him to forget all right and equitie, inſomuch as being filled with wrath and anger, though his Nobles did enforce themſelues to haue retayned him, and would haue taken vpon them this reuenge, yet would he not be perſwaded, but made towards the <hi>Dibrian</hi> who ſtaied for him. <hi>Moſes</hi> as ſoone as he<note place="margin">Moſes flieth from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat with him.</note> ſaw him comming, ſuddenly turning about, gallopped towards his companie, and was ſo aſhamed that he durſt not abide nor ſpeake a word vnto him, but cauſing his whole army preſently to ſet forward, he made them ready to the battell. The Prince of <hi>Albany</hi> in the meane time returned to his forces, who were nothing diſcontented with this adieu betweene them: and eſpecially the Turkes for their partes were very glad of it, knowing well the great and manifeſt inequality that was betweene the two parties. He that ſhould compare the brauerie of the challenge made by the defiant with the ſhamefulneſſe of his flight, would thinke that either <hi>Moſes</hi> being aſhamed of his promiſe made to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> was willing to be acquitted of it as of an ill debt, and that being terrified with the preſent daunger, it made him to turne his backe: or elſe that he did it of a fooliſh and raſh preſumption, thinking that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> would not haue ſtirred out of his place to meete him, and himſelfe confeſſed no leſſe afterwardes at ſuch time as he returned into <hi>Albany.</hi> But for my part I am rather of this minde, <q>that God, euen that great God which hath eſtabliſhed the kings of the earth in their<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> thrones, hath imprinted in their countenances certaine characters of his diuinitie, which maketh them venerable and terrible aboue other men.</q> And ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> who had neuer ſeene his King in choller and diſpleaſure with him, could not then beare nor endure the maieſtie of his angrie viſage: ſo that herein he verified the olde and <q>common prouerbe: namely, when the eye ſeeth that it neuer ſaw, the heart thinketh<note place="margin">A Prouerbe.</note> that which it neuer thought.</q>

And thus was both the Cauallerie and the Infanterie diſpoſed as well in the battallions of the vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard ordained for the firſt charge and onſet, as alſo in the rerewarde, and laſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, which were ordained for the ſeconding of the fight. <hi>Moſes</hi> made one onely<note place="margin">Order of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes his battell againſt Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg.</note> front of his horſemen, of whom he placed in the head of the battell about a foure thouſande for the firſt charge and encounter of the enemie. The like number did he ordaine at their backes, in which place alſo he had beſtowed, with eſpeciall choiſe, manie of his ſtouteſt and moſt reſolute ſouldiers, both to ſtay the former, if they ſhould either be affraied, or happen to flie before their enemies, as alſo to aide them if they ſhould be harde beſtead, and to repreſſe the furie of the enemie: by meanes whereof the rerewarde (which him ſelfe commaunded, and helde neere at hande) might haue the more leaſure to prepare themſelues eyther to aſſayle and charge vppon the enemie, or elſe (if neede were) to remedie any diſorder: and if anie misfortune ſhould befall them, to prouide for himſelfe with more ſuertie and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie.

The <hi>Dibrian</hi> ſtood not ſtill at any time, but beſtirring himſelfe with notable induſtrie on all ſides, ſometimes here, ſometimes there, with a braue courage, and without all regard of death or daunger, did animate and encourage his ſouldiers both by wordes and by deedes: and by his preſence did reeſtabliſh and ſtrengthen the battell in diuerſe places. As yet was not the ſecond battell fully ouerthrowen and diſordered, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thoſe forces which (as we ſaid before) were placed behind for a ſupply to ſecond and ſupport them. Notwithſtanding the continuall and often charges giuen vppon them by the Prince of <hi>Albanie,</hi> did in the ende make them faint both in courage and in ſtrength, and in deſpight of all their reſiſtance the <hi>Albanois</hi> with their ſwords in their hands did make themſelues way through them euen to the rerewarde, there to carrie away the honour and laſt conſequence of the whole battell. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeeing that, did ſpeedily ſet forwarde with his owne Cornet: and being attended with a ſtrong battallion of all the braueſt men and beſt mounted, he came to that ſame place, ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring to reenforce and to reaſſure them. And true it is, that by his comming, the Chriſtians found the victory ſomwhat more bloudie, but of neuer the leſſe aſſurance and certaintie: For that the other ſquadrons of the <hi>Epyrots</hi> following cloſe after their fellowes, and euen at the backe of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> and the two wings (which ſtoode in a readineſſe round about them) did in a manner beſiege and hemme in the <hi>Paynims</hi> on all ſides. As long as <hi>Moſes</hi> held good, there was no regard had of them that fled, but for a while his abode made the Chriſtians to keepe together, by reaſon that he endured their charge with great courage, and would not for a long time giue ouer, notwithſtanding the great ſlaughter &amp; butcherie that was made of his people. When he ſaw <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> comming againſt him, he durſt not abide nor tarrie to encounter him, but ſhunned his preſence with all his power, and would not come to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat with him: onely he did hearten on and preſſe forwarde againſt him the ſtrength of all his forces and troupes as many as he could poſſiblie, thinking without any ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of his perſon to haue brought him to his laſt ende, by whoſe ſafetie the eſtate of <hi>Albanie</hi> could neuer come to ruine. On all ſides did the Chriſtians preſſe vpon the Infidels both in flanke and in front, and they neuer thought of comming to their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, till ſuch time as they had both wholly ouerthrowen the enemies vauntgard, and broken their maine battell, and gotten many of their colours and enſignes, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſlaughter of diuerſe Leaders and Captaines, whoſe heads being faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vpon the points of launces and pikes by ſome of the ſouldiers, did wonderfully augment (as the faſhion is) the feare and terrour of the reſt.

It was an occaſion alſo, that both the flight of the Barbarians was deferred for a while, and that the butchery and ſlaughter of the others was farre greater then otherwiſe it would haue bene: for their courages now beginning to be reuiued, and they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to take hart againe, the Barbarian whoſe hand had once bene fortunate againſt the perſon of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> did now once againe demaund and vrge him to the combat, as though it had bene a conqueſt onely due and allotted vnto him. But our peereleſſe Chieftaine being ſetled within his ſaddle, and hauing recouered his ſtirrups, and the conceipt of this vnwonted diſgrace making the bloud to ariſe in his face, he would not ſuffer that any other but himſelfe ſhould take the reuenge thereof: And therefore<note place="margin">Victorie of Scanderbeg againſt Moſes and the Turks</note> enraged with anger, he made towards his enemie, aſſailed him moſt furiouſly, and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him ſo hard, that hauing giuen him many cruell and mortall wounds, &amp; him ſelf not hurt at all, in the end the Infidell fell downe dead at his feete. The Turke being thus ouerthrowen and ſlaine, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> paſſed on, and with an high voice calling for <hi>Moſes,</hi> he addreſſed and bent all his furie againſt him, who (I doubt not) would haue abidden and ſtood to him, if not for any hope of the victorie, yet at leaſtwiſe<note place="margin">Moſes his flight.</note> for his honour and reputation: if both the daylight and his companie had not quite forſaken him whileſt himſelfe was earneſtly buſied in fighting.

            <p>The victorie thus obtained, and the baggage, both their owne and that of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, being gathered together and truſſed vp, the armie retyred to their firſt lodgings,<note place="margin">Triumph of Scanderbeg &amp; the Epirots for the victory againſt Moſes and the Turks.</note> where the ordinarie garriſon was eſtabliſhed: there did not they make any long ſtay, but <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> in great triumphe the fourth of Aprill, tooke his iourney to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Croy.</hi> Now beganne the olde dolour and griefe to be quite forgotten, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by this new ioy and gladneſſe: the time it ſelfe (which is the beſt <q>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine for ſuch maladies) hauing by little and litle mitigated the violence and extremitie of that paſſion.

In like manner there was ſent a ſolemne Ambaſſade vnto <hi>Naples</hi> with many notable<note place="margin">Ambaſſadors from Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg to Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus king of Naples.</note> and worthie preſents, which were as ſignes and markes of their new proſperitie: and might teſtifie to the contentment and ioy of his friend the king <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> that the diſhonor of <hi>Belgrade,</hi> and the domeſticall treaſon of <hi>Moſes</hi> was now reuenged and recompenced.

            <p>In this meane ſeaſon, <hi>Moſes</hi> and his companions hauing wandred ſomefew daies vp and downe vpon the marches of <hi>Albanie,</hi> knew not what way to take, nor what courſe to reſolue vppon.

The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he tooke to induce them vnto it was vpon this: That oftentimes things
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:13368:179"/>
which are moſt deſperate being hazarded with a ſetled reſolution, do come in the end to be more fortunate then thoſe that are done with beſt aduiſe &amp; conſideration: that vnto men vanquiſhed there remaineth no other hope of ſafetie then by victorie: and<q>

And to this purpoſe did he vſe many ſpeeches to the like effect: promiſing them moreouer that by reaſon of his great practiſe and skill in the waies, places, and paſſages of the countrie, he would conduct and leade them without any danger both by day and by night (which themſelues ſhould thinke beſt) euen to the campe of their enemies: and the rather for that (as he gaue them to vnderſtand) the armie of the <hi>Epirots</hi> was reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red backe to <hi>Croy,</hi> and that the garriſon left vppon the frontiers was not comparable vnto them neither in number nor yet in valure. But how is it poſſible to perſwade them who are in a maze and terror?

Thus this vnfortunate and vnhappy man was enforced once againe by his ill fortune (which did accompanie him) with many grieuous and ſecret ſighes and groanes, to abandon the ſweet ſoile of his natiue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, which he had once before forſaken by his ouer vaine and wilfull diſloialtie.</p>
            <p>Betwene the time of the departure of <hi>Moſes</hi> from the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and his returne backe againe to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> there paſſed almoſt two Monethes, during which ſpace, for that there was no certain report nor tidings brought vnto the <hi>Ottoman</hi> of that which<note place="margin">Mahomet his imaginations of Moſes ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in his ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</note> had happened: his long ſtay was an occaſion, that he thought things to be in another caſe then indeede they were. He was diſtracted into diuerſe and ſundrie opinions, ſometimes imagining that <hi>Moſes</hi> was beaten and diſcomfited: ſometimes that his armie was betrayed and ſold by him vnto <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi> One while he would imagine (as his deſire was) that <hi>Moſes</hi> was come to combat bodie to bodie with <hi>Scanderbeg:</hi> But then he doubted leaſt he being ſlaine by the Prince of <hi>Albanie</hi> his forces ſhould incurre the ſame misfortune, or at the leaſt be brought in bondage and thraldome to his enemie: another while he would thinke otherwiſe: and (as euerie man doth <q>flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> himſelfe in beleeuing that which he either hopeth or feareth,) ſo would <hi>Mahomet</hi> perſwade and ſooth himſelfe in this conceipt, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was victorious in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat: that the deſire of ſpoiling the countrie,</q> and of reducing the prouince vnder his commaund and obedience, did draw him on to proſecute his victorie, to follow his good fortune, and to prepare vnto himſelfe the crowne and ſcepter of <hi>Epyre,</hi> which had bene promiſed him. But now the arriuall of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſhewing all things to be farre otherwiſe then he pretended or expected, and the ſhamefull ſpectacle of thoſe reliques of his armie which were returned, did breede a moſt grieuous diſcontentment and offence both in the hart of the <hi>Sultan</hi> himſelfe, who was euen mad for anger, and in<note place="margin">Moſes at his returne out of Epire to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſt antinople is in publique diſgrace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt the Turkes.</note> the eyes of euerie priuate and particular perſon: inſomuch that <hi>Moſes</hi> was generally condemned and reproued: all men reproaching and accuſing him, that he had either by his faithleſneſſe and infidelitie, or by his raſhneſſe and temeritie deſtroyed all the flower of <hi>Greece,</hi> and in a moment had erected and reſtored the courages of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who were earſt in diſmay and confuſion vpon the calamitie of <hi>Belgrade.</hi> The <hi>Dibrian</hi> himſelfe being both aſhamed and mindfull of his misfortune, as alſo of his<note place="margin">Moſes iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</note> flight, could not endure to come in the ſight of men, nor to heare the ſlaunders and reproaches which were ſpoken of him. How be it the good and fauorable reports of

his ſouldiers, (who therein did ſhift the blame from themſelues alſo) did make him well thought of by verie many: for they did openly giue out and maintaine it, that he had done the dutie and deuoire, and had performed the part both of a wiſe and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Chieftaine, and of a valiant and hardie ſouldier, in the battell againſt <hi>Scanderbeg:</hi> and that there was neuer any man that did ſtriue with more obſtinacy and courage to renue and reſtore the fortune of the fight declining to the worſt.

his heart: to leaue and forſake the Infidell, who knew not how to eſteeme nor iudge of the actions of men otherwiſe then by the iſſue and euent of things, and not by the intent of the parties that doe them. He determined therefore, to returne againe to his natiue countrie, to yeeld himſelfe into the hands of his Prince, and to ſubmit himſelfe to the mercie of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> whom he had ſo highly offended: hoping that by this his repentance he ſhould aboliſh, if not the note, yet at leaſt the paine and puniſhment which he had moſt worthily deſerued, and in ſo doing, he ſhould auenge himſelfe alſo of the vngratefull <hi>Ottoman:</hi> and a ſpeciall reaſon that induced him therunto was, that he was aſſured, that the clemencie and courteſie of his Prince did farre exceed the badneſſe of his merits and miſdeedes. By this concluſion hauing quieted and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his mind, he did daily deuiſe with himſelfe, how he might eſcape and get away. The night (as it fell out) was the fitteſt time for his purpoſe, and therefore diſlodging in the edge of an euening, ſo as the watch could not perceiue his departure: he made one whole and continuall iourney both of that night and the next day following, not reſting in any place, nor ſuffering his horſes to breath themſelues, till ſuch time as being entred into that part of the countrie of <hi>Thrace</hi> which confineth vpon <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi>

Thus within few dayes being entred into <hi>Epyre,</hi> he tooke the next and ſhorteſt way poſſible to the garriſon where he was wont to commaund, purpoſing to goe from thence and to proſtrate himſelfe at the feete of <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi> Aſſoone as the <hi>Dibrians</hi> perceiued him to be come, their harts ſeemed to relent euen at the verie ſight of him: in ſuch ſort, that immediately there began to be reuiued in them the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of their former conuerſation with their auncient and wonted Captaine. They grew into vtter forgetfulnes and obliuion, how he had peruerted all rightes both di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and humaine, in being diſloiall to his countrie, to his citizens, and to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per bloud and kindred. They could not welcome him without abundance of teares, and ſo with infinite ſalutations &amp; embracements, they conſumed and ſpent the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of that day: and then being giuen to vnderſtand by them, that the King was not farre from thence, he chaunged his determination of going to <hi>Croy,</hi> and went preſently to ſeeke out his Soueraigne. A great number of the garriſon did accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie him, to the intent he might be the better graced in preſenting himſelfe before his preſence, and might the more eaſily obtaine his pardon.

Preſently vpon the ſight of the King, in extreame griefe and ſorrowe he fell vpon his knees, and proſtrated himſelfe at the feete of his Prince, the teares trickling downe his cheekes, and in moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner, he beſought his Maieſtie to forgiue him his offence, and to graunt him pardon, not for the reſpect of any his forepaſſed merits, but onely in regarde of his meere bountie and royall clemencie: proteſting and vowing, that if it would pleaſe him to remit his fault, and to graunt him his life, he would moſt willingly conſecrate and expoſe the ſame from henceforth for the encreaſe and honour of his Realme, and for the libertie of his countrie.

            <p>I doe not thinke it any ſtrange matter in <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> that he receiued <hi>Moſes</hi> to his mercie: but that he ſhould ſo readily and with ſuch facilitie be drawen to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don<note place="margin">Clemencie and rare humanity of Scanderbeg.</note> him, who had ſhewed ſuch notable hatred, had vomited foorth ſo many iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and had attempted ſo notorious a miſchiefe againſt his Prince: that he ſhould no ſooner haue a ſight of him or heare him ſpeake: but he ſhould ſo bountifully and with ſuch aſſured commiſeration and clemencie rather diuine then humaine, receiue him into his good liking and former amitie: and euen then alſo when the griefe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued for the death of thoſe (who were lately ſlaine) was yet ſcarcely forgotten, nor the woundes of the hurt yet throughly cured: this is a matter ſo rare and ſtrange that it cannot be thought nor imagined without great wonder and admiration. And beſides all this: euen at that verie time, and within fewe dayes vpon his returne, he tooke ſpeciall care and gaue order, that his goods, which had bene confiſcated and<note place="margin">Moſes reſtored to his former liuings, offices and dignitie.</note> deuided amongeſt particular perſons, ſhould be reſtored vnto him, together with all his lands and offices: whereat the people tooke great pleaſure and contentment. Thus by this milde and moderate demeanour, this courteous Prince did purchaſe both vnto himſelfe eternall praiſe and commendation, and to the other, a generall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhment of his reproach and infamie: and all remembraunce of offence was quite and cleane extinguiſhed out of the heartes of the people of <hi>Albanie.</hi> For the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince<note place="margin">Ioy and triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ph of the Epirots for the returne and reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Moſes.</note> imitating the modeſtie of their King, did ſeeme as willing to burie all their griefes in obliuion, and they made ſhew thereof by bonfires, and ſuch like tokens of triumphe which they publiquely demeaned for the reſtitution of their <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi> Whereunto the King alſo added a perpetuall edict and decree: enioyning and commaunding all his ſubiectes, that from thenceforwardes no man liuing ſhould make any ſpeeches or mention of that offence.

            <p>Nowe if <hi>Epyre</hi> and the <hi>Albanois</hi> on the one ſide did triumphe for ioy of the<note place="margin">Mahomet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented at the departure of Moſes.</note> reconciliation of their <hi>Moſes, Mahomet</hi> on the other ſide had loſt all patience, when he vnderſtood that he was returned into his country. With notable inuectiues he accuſed him, not ſo much for the miſhappe of his ouerthrowe, as of pure and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt treaſon, imagining as a conſequence of this accident, that his flight and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion which he had ſo ſimply beleeued, was euen from the beginning one of the ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagemes and policies of <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi> He tooke counſell therefore concerning his proceedings in the warre of <hi>Epyre,</hi> and how he might be reuenged. But amongſt manie opinions there debated, that onely preuayled, by which he was aduiſed to abſtaine altogether from armes for that yeare: ſuppoſing it neceſſarie to attende ſome fit occaſion and opportunitie, or to employ all the forces and power of the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi> Empire for the reducing of this Nation to order and reaſon. Which opinion was receiued ſo much the more willingly, for that there was ſome rumour and report of troubles and tumultes towardes from out of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and from the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> Neuertheleſſe a garriſon was ſent to be vppon the borders, yet not ſuch as was of ſufficient ſtrength and puiſſance, either to repreſſe the roades or brauadoes of our men, which they made ordinarily vpon the countrie, or to ſerue the turne and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full occaſions of the <hi>Sfetigradians</hi> and other places neere adioyning. The King
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:13368:181"/>
of <hi>Epire</hi> likewiſe hauing learned the deliberation of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> both by the aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by his owne intelligencers, did for a time diſmiſſe all thought and care of the warres, ſaue that vppon the newes of the comming of this garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he aſſembled a running Campe, and for ſome few daies kept himſelfe cloſe in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhments vppon the borders. But the Barbarians paſsing no farther then <hi>Alchria,</hi> made all that expedition to turne to nothing: and therefore hauing prouided for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe affaires of conſequence, and hauing left <hi>Moſes</hi> in that place, he retired with the Queene to a countrey on the ſea coaſts commonly called <hi>Redona,</hi> there to recreat him<note place="margin">Redona.</note> ſelfe for the reſidue of the ſommer, where he paſſed moſt part of the Autumne in hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and ſuch like exerciſes of pleaſure.</p>
            <p>I cannot but in this place acknowledge in him that which the famous captaine <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi>
               <note place="margin">Continency of Scanderbeg.</note> the <hi>African</hi> was wont to require in al excellent chieftaines and generals of armies, and that was his notable continency towards womankind, which was admirable, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well in regard of his owne wife, as of others likewiſe: for he would commonly ſay:<q>
                  <note place="margin">Saing of Scanderbeg touching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continency in ſouldiours.</note> that nothing was a greater enemy, nor more pernicious to the ſtrength &amp; vigor both of the body &amp; the mind, then the immoderat company of women, and that it behoued ſouldiers by continuall trauaile and labour, by daily watching, by ſleeping vpon the ground to tame their bodies, and to ſubdue &amp; keepe vnder thoſe immoderat paſſions and whot affections of luxuriouſnes: thus by ſuch kind of ſpeeches &amp; by his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, he would vſe to repreſſe &amp; reſtrain the ſouldiers from viſiting their houſes too often and with ouermuch curioſity.</q> This one thing is moſt memorable alſo in <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Diſcipline ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued by Sca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg in his Campe.</note> that there was neuer ſeene in his Campe any whores, or ſuch like baggage, or trugs (as they now terme them:) but he obſerued amongſt his ſouldiers a certaine and ſeuere kinde of diſcipline, according to the vſage and cuſtome of the auncients, and he retained them in a wonderfull and reuerent regard of religion, both in words and in deedes. And it may be that this was it that encreaſed and maintained ſo long time this eſtate of <hi>Albany</hi> in ſo great glory and felicity: neither is it vnlikely but that God being by thoſe meanes drawen to fauour and bleſſe them, did ſo ſharpen both the ſwords and the ſpirites of the <hi>Albanois.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the time of this reſt from armes, <hi>Moſes</hi> had his minde ſet on nothing ſo much, as to ſeeke out ſome inuention, and by ſome notable enterpriſe, both to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire his owne honour, and with one and the ſame meane to be reuenged vpon the ingratitude of the <hi>Sultan.</hi> An euident example, that we ought not altogether to <q>deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire of the amendement of men when we ſee them in any ill courſe, but rather that<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> we receiue them kindly to grace and fauour. For <hi>Moſes</hi> hauing augmented the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, and the numbers of his bands being doubled,</q> he did daily exerciſe him ſelfe in ſacking of the countrey, thinking to haue drawen foorth the Turkes to encounter with him: ſometimes in the day would he make out with a ſmall company, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the night and in ſecrete with greater forces: and continually would he light vppon ſome one or other, putting them to the ſworde whom hee found either as ſpies, or going on foraging, or vpon ſuch like ſeruices, but the <hi>Mahometans</hi> not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nor venturing to come abroad to any purpoſe, nothing was done worthy the remembraunce.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Moſes</hi> on the one ſide did all his deuoire and emploied his beſt meanes to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh and waſhe away the infamy of his former miſdeedes: ſo on the other ſide (I know not how) it came to paſſe, that ſome deuill and wicked ſpirit, or rather the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> or the ineuitable force of the deſtinies, did raiſe vp <hi>Ameſe</hi> to<note place="margin">Rebellion of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſe againſt Scanderbeg.</note> be the inheritour and ſucceſſour of the like wickedneſſe no leſſe damnable and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieuous. There are many things in this place which doe depriue me of all deſire to
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:13368:182"/>
proceede any further in this diſcourſe, for that the remembraunce of theſe domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and ciuill affaires, and of the ingratitude of men, is not onely vnpleaſing and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous vnto me, but I doe euen abhorre to write of them, and the rather for that I could neuer find any certaine cauſe of his flight. Euery man hath his opinion, and the moſt part of the reports which goe vppon it, are without any ground or foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of trueth. For this cauſe I will imitate the Painters, who as they vſe with their Penciles to ſhadowe things, ſo will I couer and conceale this in ſilence as a thing both ſuperfluous in this Hiſtory, and litle pleaſing to the readers. For omitting the iealouſie which he conceiued at the kinde entertainment and reconciliation of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> I doe thinke for my part, that there was no other cauſe nor occaſion of his reuolt, out that onely which (as we haue ſaied) was practiſed to corrupt <hi>Moſes:</hi> to wit: The working &amp; ſollicitations of the Turkiſh officers neare adioyning, and of their agents interpoſing and dealing betweene them: for you muſt ſuppoſe, that this was no hard matter for the Infidell to doe, but that he might many and often times by ſecret meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers communicate and treat with <hi>Ameſe:</hi> for he was poſſeſſed of a goodly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, faire and large in the confines of the Turke, by the liberality and bounty of his vncle: who thought it not good nor conuenient to retaine him longer in Court, without any patrimony or meanes to mainetaine his eſtate. There was another reſpect alſo which did incite the <hi>Ottoman</hi> who (as wee haue ſaied before) was now occupied and buſied in the affaires of <hi>Aſia,</hi> to practiſe with <hi>Ameſe</hi> and to gaine him vnto him: becauſe being of the bloud royall, and neare vnto the Crowne, and withall knowing him to be in credite and fauour with the people, he was perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that they would gladly yeelde to ſubmit them ſelues to his dominion, much rather then to <hi>Moſes,</hi> if they were once preſſed with any the leaſt perill and daunger that might be. Theſe ouertures and faire hopes being preſented to the thoughtes and imaginations of <hi>Ameſe,</hi> by perſons purpoſely appointed to inſinuate the ſame vnto <q>him, did finde ready and eaſie entraunce into his young and tender heart. Thus we ſee, that the mad and franticke deſire of rule and Empire, doth make men not onely<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> faithleſſe and diſloiall, but alſo ouer credulous and light of beliefe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Ameſe</hi> being made wary and aduiſed, as one whom the misfortune of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had ſufficiently warned, and ſufficiently inſtructed in all points, becauſe he would<note place="margin">Ameſe goeth to Mahomet with his wife and children.</note> not goe nor preſent him ſelfe to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> with the perill of his life, or with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhew or ſhadow of ſuſpition: he tooke and led away with him both his wife and his children, as thoſe that ſhould aunſwer for his true and plaine meaning, and ſhould acquite him from the ſuſpect of any crime: and he deliuered them vnto the Infidell, as the ſure and certaine gages of his faith and fidelity. His departure bred maruellous tumult and aſtoniſhment throughout all the Prouince: euery man thought it very ſtraunge, and was inquiſitiue after the cauſe and motiue of this his rebellion, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that beſides his neare kindred, he was continually held and reputed by <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg,</hi> as the companion and conſort of his Empire and royalty. This accident being reported to his vncle, he tooke it very impatiently, and with his friends and <q>famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, he beganne to complaine and bemoane his hard fortune. Muſt this (ſayd he)<note place="margin">Speech of Scanderbeg touching the rebellion of Ameſe.</note> needes fall out to make vp the meaſure of my trauels and ſorrowes, that I muſt be aſſaulted with domeſticall and ciuill warres? Am I ſo odious, or is my countrey ſo vngratefull vnto me? or is it the honour of this Crowne and ſcepter, that is ſo deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and held ſo precious: but <hi>Ameſe</hi> (it ſeemeth) did beare enuy to <hi>Moſes,</hi> well, if God, if the right and law of nations, and if your vertue do not deceiue me, he ſhall yet haue greater cauſe then euer to enuy him.</q>

               </gap>e or other fruites, did put <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> in hope, that he ſhould for a time be freede from the preparations and trouble of the enemy: and there was good and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraunt occaſion to induce him to be of that mind, and to beleeue that <hi>Ameſe</hi> would attend and ſtay for the ſpring of the yeare, for the ſetting abroach of his new plots and enterpriſes. For this cauſe he retired with all his traine to <hi>Croy,</hi> not taking anie care for the leauying of any forces or other preparations of the warre: and there he ſpent and conſumed the winter, oftentimes viſiting the garriſon of the <hi>Dibrians,</hi> and preparing him ſelfe by his eſpials and ordinary gardes to be in a readineſſe for the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels and daungers that were ſhortly to enſue.</p>
            <p>The ſight of <hi>Ameſe</hi> did not ſo much moue the Turkiſh Monarch, as did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the ſpeech which hee vſed vnto him: for the valour and ſufficiency of this perſonage cauſed him to haue him in admiration, after hee hadde once heard him<note place="margin">Deſcription of Ameſe his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</note> ſpeake, and that he knew his prudence and wiſedome by the grauity of his diſcourſe and ſounde reaſons. For as touching his ſtature, it was ſo ſmall and ſo vnſightlie, that at the firſt appearaunce it could not yeelde any ſhew of thoſe ſecret and rare per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of his minde: but in recompence of that defect of his perſon, hee hadde an heart extreame haughtie, and he was of ſo quicke and ſharpe a conceipt, and of ſo delicate and ſubtile a ſpirite as none could be more. Of all men he was moſt impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and could leaſt away with eaſe and idleneſſe: and (which in men couetous and deſirous of Empire are the principall and chiefeſt partes to gette them honour, and the good grace of euery man) his liberalitie and courteſie were no whit inferiour to his other vertues. What ſo euer he got either by the purchaſe of his owne ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and valour and by the fortune of the warres, or by the beneficence and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his vncle, he did wholly depart and diſtribute it amongeſt his ſouldiours and his friendes: he was very officious and ſeruiceable to all men, very familiar and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to be acquainted with, and (as occaſion did require) he could diſſemble ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, and with excellent good skill and cunning. By theſe qualities had he gained ſo great authority and good liking in the heartes of all men, that next to <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg</hi> I doe not know any one man that was ſo beloued, and reuerenced both of the people and of the ſouldiours: in ſo much that ſome haue affirmed, that there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not diuerſe of the moſt priuate and inward friendes of his vncle, who did often admoniſh him to take good care and regard to a minde that was ſo ſtirring and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious. But as he would not be perſwaded to credite any ſuch conceipt, ſo did he make litle or no account thereof. Notwithſtanding in proceſſe of time, when his flight and rebellion came to be knowen and manifeſted, he was ſooner drawen to beleeue the report thereof in him, then he was before of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and he then began to call to minde the naturall diſpoſition of the man, which had beene better obſerued and marked by others then by himſelfe. But to our purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ameſe</hi> being admitted to the preſence of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> did not fill his eares with idle and inſolent promiſes and vaunts as <hi>Moſes</hi> had done: but colouring the cauſe of his reuolt and repaire to the <hi>Sultan</hi> with one onely reaſon, to the intent his ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches might not be accounted either vaine and inconſtant, or fained and diſſembled, he began in this manner to ſpeake vnto him.</p>
            <p>Thrice happie and inuincible Monarch, if it be lawfull for vs to recall to <q>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie<note place="margin">Oration of Ameſe to Mahomet.</note> the errours and iniuries which we haue in times paſt committed againſt thy Maieſty: it might well and rightly be ſayed, that we are now come to receiue the worthy and deſerued puniſhment of our offences, rather then the hope and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any honours and dignities. For wherein could wee haue treſpaſſed and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended more grieuouſlie againſt the Empire of <hi>Ottoman,</hi> then we did in that action
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:13368:183"/>
of ours heretofore executed in the warre of <hi>Hungarie?</hi> at that time, when with equall and no leſſe infidelity we both betraied thy army in the battell of <hi>Morana,</hi> and when we tooke <hi>Epire,</hi> by deceipt and fraud out of thy hands? the true originall and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of ſo many miſchiefes and calamities? of all which enterpriſes and practiſes I doe confeſſe that I was a partner and conſort. For it behoueth me now, being in the preſence of your Maieſty, not to ſtand vppon the defence and iuſtification of my doings, but onely to plead my contrition and repentaunce: but I hold it a vaine thing to ſtand in any feare or doubt before ſo prudent and gracious a Prince, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that my age at that time, and my youth inclining to his owne misfortune, and my minde being but badly ſtaied in her deliberations and counſels, did then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps deceiue and beguile me. I was then lead to beleeue my vncle, and did ſuffer my ſelfe ſimply to be perſwaded of many things, and being entiſed with a deſire of rule and gouernment (a diſeaſe properly incident to that age) through too much creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty forſaking thy ſeruice, I followed him and the hope of his faire promiſes: but as my vnderſtanding encreaſed with my years, I ſoone began to diſcerne the ſecrete diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loialty of my vncle, and that this my reuolt from the <hi>Ottoman</hi> obeiſance, was more pernicious to me then to any other. By my labours and by my aide, hath <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> recouered and amplified his eſtate. Long did I ſtay and attend to ſee, if he would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me any part or portion of the poſſeſsions which were mine owne inheritaunce, deſcending vnto me (if not from my aunceſters) yet in the right of my father: and I did looke that hee ſhould haue yeelded me ſome recompence and reward for ſo many trauelles and perils which I had endured. Within a while after he got him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a wife, and begat a new heire and a new ſucceſſour to his Crowne: and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that litle which he did for me, the very ſhame of the world did driue him to doe it: for perceiuing that he could not with any honeſty ſuffer mee ſtill to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine and to continue within his Court as a priuate perſon, he aſſigned me out a litle corner of <hi>Epire,</hi> the moſt vileſt and worſt place of the countrey, where (whileſt he vſurped all the reſt vnto him ſelfe) I ſhould haue ſpent and conſumed my dayes in obſcurity and baſe account. I had much a doe to moderate my ſelfe, my heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not able to digeſt the ignominie: neuertheleſſe the qualitie of the time, and the naturall pride and arrogancie of the man, did enforce me to conceale and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble all things, for feare leaſt vnder pretence and colour of ſome ſuſpition, he might ſodainely circumuent and ſurprize me, as he did of late <hi>George Streeze</hi> his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſonne, whom with ſuborned accuſations of ſuppoſed crimes, hee deſpoyled well neare of all his liuings and dominions. Willingly would I (moſt worthie <hi>Ottoman</hi>) haue hadde recourſe vnto thy Maieſty, and I would gladly haue forſaken and abandonned my ingrate vncle, and the infamy of his Empire: but the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of our former rebellion, and of our ſo many outrages, done againſt the Crowne and dignity of <hi>Ottoman,</hi> did terrifie and detaine me vntill this preſent time: wherein by the diuine permiſsion, following the aſſuraunce of thy faith and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, I am now come vnto thee glad and ioyous. Thou haddeſt no ſooner giuen me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſigne and token, thou haddeſt no ſooner called and inuited me, but that ſpeedily and with all diligence, I conformed me to thy will, and I came running vnto thee, to whom my mind had ſo long time bene affectioned. I did not defer &amp; put off my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, neither did I ſtay till ſome misfortune might befall to <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> or that thy good fortune were increaſed, as did <hi>Moſes</hi> lately: ſo that thou haſt no cauſe to thinke or to coniecture, that either feare, or the doubt of any iminent daunger, did make me to haue a regard rather to my owne good, then the fulfilling of thy commandements. And in trueth, (moſt noble <hi>Mahomet</hi>) I haue not left any matter of ſuſpition either
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:13368:183"/>
for thee to diſtruſt my fidelity, or in my countrey of <hi>Epire,</hi> whereby I ſhould deſire to returne thither hereafter: behold here the aſſured bonds of my aduiſed and ſettled determinations, and the perpetuall gages of my faith and fidelity, euen my wife and my children. Behold (O <hi>Mahomet</hi>) all the goods that nature hath graunted vnto me: whatſoeuer it be wherein I can take any pleaſure or delight during my life, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen that which is moſt deare and precious in the eies of mortall men, thou haſt it here preſented vnto thee. I haue brought vnto thee thoſe precious iewels, which if they were in the hands of enemies, I ſhould labour to free them: euen ſuch a pledge as may make any faith (howſoeuer doubtfull and ſuſpicious) to be moſt firmely tied and bound in all aſſured loialty: all other things (ſaue them) I haue left behinde me, becauſe in my haſty and ſecrete flight, I could not poſsibly make prouiſion of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cariage or neceſſaries. And albeit I might all at leaſure and in ſecurity haue truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vppe and brought my baggage with me: what honour hadde it bene for me to bring vnto the preſence of ſo puiſſaunt and rich a Monarch, the ordures and dregs (as it were) of my former eſtate and fortune? The greateſt and the only thing which I can preſent vnto thee is my faith and loialty, which in truth is the vttermoſt that my ability can afford: of the which if thou require any further, or more certaine aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, I ſubmit my ſelfe wholly to any other order whatſoeuer your Maieſty ſhall ordaine. I am not come hither to giue or to preſcribe lawes, but to take lawes and to be commaunded: I will not promiſe with fifteene thouſand men to ouerthrow thy aduerſary, and to tame the pride of the <hi>Albanois:</hi> the misfortune of <hi>Haly Baſſa,</hi> and of ſo many other braue and valiaunt Chiefetaines, and the freſh and rare (though moſt bloudy) victory of <hi>Sebalias,</hi> may ſerue for an example, to teach and learne me, how I promiſe any thing beyond my power and ability. But this I proteſt vnto thee (moſt puiſſant <hi>Ottoman</hi>) that thou ſhalt not want in mee any readineſſe or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe of my beſt ſeruice and fidelity. As for other matters, either concerning the euent of theſe affaires, or the reuenge of thy iniuries or outrages, thou haſt no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as the Lord and maiſter of his ſlaue: a moſt expert and approued warriour of an vnskilfull and ſimple ſouldiour: to expect or looke for any counſell, or to thinke that I am to giue any aduiſe or direction.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Oration of <hi>Ameſe</hi> could not ſeeme to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> to be diſſembled or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed, both for that he propounded many things true and apparaunt, as alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his faith did manifeſt it ſelfe ſufficiently in that hee had brought with him his wife and children.

               <hi>Alba Greca</hi> or <hi>Taururum,</hi> had greatly weakned the ſpirits, and abated the courages of the Barbarians: for in that battell had <hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelfe bene grieuouſly wounded and put to flight by <hi>Huniades,</hi> with the loſſe of 40000. men, beſides all his artillery, baggage and munition, which he was conſtrained to leaue there behind him, for the

            </p>
            <p>The ſpring being ſpent in theſe preparations, the heate of ſommer began now to<note place="margin">1456.</note> come on, by which time all things being in a readines, the king of Turkes inſtigated and vnceſſantly vrged on by <hi>Ameſe,</hi> who (as ſome ſay) was created a <hi>Saniacke,</hi> did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch<note place="margin">Ameſe created a Saniacke by Mahomet.

            <p>The <hi>Epirots</hi> were litle pleaſed or contented at the newes of theſe mighty preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but eſpecially the <hi>Dibrians:</hi> for the ſouldiers in thoſe partes had diuerſe conceipts and imaginations (as it is ordinarily ſeene in ſuch caſes) what meanes might be vſed either to receiue or to repulſe the enemy, whether by ambuſhmentes, or in the plaine and open field, and in ſome place purpoſely appointed: or whether this warre ſhould be decided by delaying and temporizing, and by obſeruing of opportunities and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntages. One thing there was that did more aſtoniſh them then all the reſt, and that was: that though the rumour and report of the comming of the enemy did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe daily, yet on their partes, they ſaw not any leauie nor muſter of any armie yet begun, nor no remedy prepared againſt a miſchiefe ſo imminent, and a daunger that was ſo neare haſtening vppon them. For, to ſaie the trueth, this rumour at the firſt did not greatly moue <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> for that eſpeciallie hee could not be perſwaded, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> bending all his hatred and malice againſt <hi>Epire,</hi> would let paſſe in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or forget the ſhame and diſhonour of ſo great and foule an ouerthrow as he hadde latelie receiued in <hi>Hungarie.</hi> Neuertheleſſe he made all poſsible and diligent meanes by his intelligencers and eſpialles diſperſed here and there on all partes, to learne the certainety of all the attemptes and actions of the enemy, as well as the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult and confuſion of thoſe new troubles and commotions would permit him, to the intent he might ſhape him ſelfe ſome new courſe in his counſels and proceedings: But vpon the many aduertiſements brought him, and eſpecially vpon the comming of

Neither the numbers ofſo many thouſands, nor the redoubted name or renowme of the Baſſa could terrifie or aſtoniſh them.

This was the occaſion that there was ſome delay made, and the rather alſo for that the harueſt was not yet throughly inned, nor the corne cleane caried out of the fields: and the rumor euerie day growing more &amp; more that the Barbarians approached, (for that the caſe required haſte and quicke diſpatch) the ſouldiers as well as the husbandmen were imploied in that buſineſſe: and they conueyed all their corne partly in the ſheaffe, and partly threſhed out, into the townes and caſtelles, to haue it ſafe and ſure from the handes of the enemie. By this meanes, they were well and ſufficiently prouided both of men and victualles for many mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> hauing left <hi>Moſes</hi> to commaund ouer the reſidue of the armie, went to <hi>Croie,</hi> and ſtayed there ſome three dayes taking order for diuerſe matters and vrgent affaires: eſpecially for the remoouing of the Queene and her houſhold from <hi>Petralba.</hi> From thence returning to <hi>Dibrya,</hi> he beganne to goe in hand with his buſineſſe, and with a watchfull eye and diligent care prepared himſelfe for the receiuing of his nephew, whom he determined to entertaine and vſe as a mortall and<note place="margin">Iſaac and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſe with the Turkiſh army enter into Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banie.</note> meere enemie.</p>

But <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> on the other ſide, although he had long before hand pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided all things in a readineſſe for his retrait, if neede ſhould require it: yet would he not by any meanes diſlodge, till he had true and perfect intelligence, that the Turkes were come very neare him, and that he might in a manner perceiue the duſt of their<note place="margin">Scanderbeg re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tireth from the Turkes.</note> horſes: and then truſſing vp baggage, he ſpeedily diſcamped and forſooke that place, in ſuch ſorte, that they which followed and came on behinde him might very well diſcerne him, as hee marched on before them. The Turke would not follow after, nor put himſelfe in purſuit of him, by reaſon of the difficultie and roughneſſe of the way, and for feare of ambuſhes. Onely he ſent certaine horſe after him, giuing them in charge to trouble and moleſt him as much as they could poſsibly, and to learne, what courſe and way hee helde, and whither hee went. Wherefore the armie of the Infidelles being entred into the vpper <hi>Dybria</hi> by the way of <hi>Alchria,</hi> they did marche on ſtill with a fayre and eaſie pace: continually diſcouering and ſearching farre and wide on all ſides. When the coaſt was founde to be cleare and ſafe from the enemy, the Turkiſhe companie with exceeding great ioye did diſperſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues abroad ouer all the countrey. But as this kinde and manner of victorie, ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gotten, was very pleaſing and gratious vnto the ſouldiours, now waxing inſolent through ſecurity: ſo did it no leſſe grieue them afterwardes, for that they could not finde nor meete with any pillage in the fieldes, nor light vppon any fit matter to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their couetous minds and inordinate appetites. Thus held they on their march till it was about an houre before noone: and then both becauſe they would ſtay for the returne of their vauntcurrours, and alſo for that they would reſt and refreſh them ſelues of their long iourneis, and the extreame heate of the weather, they beganne to make a ſtand, and went to lodge them ſelues neare to <hi>Oronichea</hi> in the ſame <hi>Dibria,</hi> neare adioyning to the ſame place, where our men at other times had vſed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campe<note place="margin">Oronichea in the vpper Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria.</note> them ſelues. There pitching their tentes, they ſpent the time in councell and conſultation, till ſuch time as their vauntcurrours returned vnto them: abſtaynig in the meane while both from meate and drinke, or any other kindes of refreſhing. For before their diſlodging in the morning, they had taken a ſufficient repaſt, by the aduiſe of their Generall, for feare leaſt if by ſome chance and caſualty that morning, they ſhould haue bene driuen or enforced to fight, and that the hazard of the battell ſhould haue protracted the conflict, as many times it doth: they might not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced alſo to fight with hunger as well as with their enemies. All this while did the ſouldiours take great delight curiouſly to ſuruey the place where, our men had of late encamped, and they walked vp and downe on all ſides, yet not without ſome ſuſpition of daunger: in ſo much that they neither durſt diſarme them ſelues, nor yet leaue their watch and ward: but the moſt part kept continually neare to their ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards and guidons all on horſebacke. And thus for two houres at the leaſt did they patientlie abide, keeping good watch and ward, till ſuch time as they which hadde bene ſent abroade for the diſcouerie, being returned againe, did bring report of that which they had ſeene and learned: namely, that the <hi>Epirot</hi> and his troupes did

drawe downe towardes the ſea coaſtes on that ſide whereas the Citie of <hi>Liſſa</hi> lay:<note place="margin">The citie of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexium or Liſſa</note> and being demaunded what numbers they were, they aunſwered, that they were ſeant ſufficient to make vp a good and perfect * Legion. Howbeit the truth was, that<note place="margin">A legion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth 6000.</note> the armie of the <hi>Albanois</hi> did amount to more then eleuen thouſand fighting men, whereof ſixe thouſand were horſemen, and the reſt footemen. But the errour of the Turkiſh ſcouts (as I ſuppoſe) grew of this: that our men being in <hi>Dibria,</hi> had ſent all their infanterie with their cariages, to paſſe on faire and eaſily before: fearing leſt if they ſhould haue expected the enemies comming any thing neare at hand, and ſo ſhould haue bene driuen to march in haſt, they wold not haue bene able to haue made ſuch ſpeed, as to haue gotten time enough into ſome ſure place of ſafetie: and after the footmen (as I haue ſayd) marched the horſemen, euen in the ſight almoſt of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh armie. So you ſee the occaſion why the foote forces of the <hi>Epirots</hi> were not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by the vantcurrors of the Turkes.</p>
            <p>It may be, that ſome perhaps more curious obſeruers of matters then others, will demaund vpon what reaſon, or what commoditie <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> could find in this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe and conceipt of his, in not giuing place to his aduerſarie, till he ſaw him euen cloſe at his backe? &amp; why he made his retrait rather towards <hi>Liſſa,</hi> then to any other part of the countrey? But I will, if I may, ſatisfie theſe men with the ſame reaſon that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded me: &amp; my opinion herein is nothing repugnant vnto thoſe men, whoſe faith and diligence I haue moſt followed in the continuance of this hiſtory. Beſides, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and ſucceſſe of things being curiouſly conferred together, may ſufficiently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the truth thereof. The diſſembled and counterfet feare of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> did euidently<note place="margin">Stratageme of Scanderbeg in retiring from the Turkes.</note> declare, that his firſt ſtratageme in ſtaying for the coming of the enemie ſo neare him, was to make a ſhewe, that he meant to fight, and to hazard the fortune of the field in a maine battell: but that, ſeeing the infinite multitude of his enemies, and the preſent danger and extremitie of the perill conſidered, did ſeeme to put him in ſuch feare and terror, as if he had bene enforced to giue backe, and to change his mind &amp; reſolution: to the intent that by his ſhew of flight, he might make the Barbarians more confident and hardy, and with more looſeneſſe and licentiouſnes to ſcatter abrode, &amp; to disband themſelues from their ſtandards, which he could not by any meanes haue wrought without great ſuſpition, if the flight of the one &amp; the coming of the other had bene more diſtant and farther off. Moreouer, he directed his courſe &amp; ſhew of flight rather towards <hi>Liſſa</hi> then to any other place, becauſe that way ſeemed to be choſen as the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and ſafeſt for men who made ſhew of feare: whereas otherwiſe if he had put him ſelfe in the other way amongſt the thicke forreſts and wooddie valleys, it was to be doubted, that he ſhould haue made leſſe ſhew offeare, and haue giuen greater cauſe of ſuſpition and coniecture to the enemy purſuing him, of ſome ſecret ambuſhments layed and diſpoſed to intrap them. Beſides it is to be beleeued, that he had an intent &amp; purpoſe, by this faire ſhew and policie (which the iſſue alſo did after make manifeſt) to deceiue and ouerreach his enemie: vpon whom being caried away with creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and ſtragling looſely abrode, he purpoſed to giue the onſet on that ſide, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the footſteps of them that fled, nor the maner of the place to which they fled, did any way make to be ſuſpected. For we ſhould do <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> great wrong, to thinke or to confeſſe, that ſo ſage and aduiſed a Chiefetaine would haue made choiſe of this courſe, only vpon a vaine and light conſideration, without any eſpeciall conceipt and<note place="margin">Iſaac Baſſa de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſe his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> concerning the flight of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg.</note> purpoſe. Hereof was <hi>Ameſe</hi> an infallible witneſſe, who albeit he were of a very ſuttle and ſearching ſpirit, &amp; had a ſharpe and quicke inſight in all matters, yet could he not keepe himſelf from the traines of this old warriour: for when the Baſſa (being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what doubtfull &amp; troubled in his mind vpon the ſleights &amp; ſubtleties of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi>
               <pb n="360" facs="tcp:13368:187"/>
did demaund of <hi>Ameſe</hi> what he thought to be the cauſe of this his ſo extraordinary and continuall flight, the like whereof he had neuer vſed?</p>
            <p>
               <q>My vncle (quoth <hi>Ameſe</hi>) did expect and attend for the forces of <hi>Moſes:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Anſwer and cenſure of Ameſe tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the flight of Sca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg.</note> hauing ſuddenly aſſembled only a running campe, according to his wonted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he did feed him ſelfe with his wonted hope of victory, till ſuch time as ſeeing him ſelfe deceiued in his fooliſh imaginations, and that he can not abide in ſafetie within his owne dominions, nor be able to oppoſe him ſelfe againſt ſuch huge and puiſſant forces, he is fled towardes <hi>Liſſa</hi> to get ayde and ſuccours of his neighbours the <hi>Venetians.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This reaſon of <hi>Ameſe</hi> ſeeming very likely and probable, was allowed and held for good, no man ſpeaking or alledging any thing to the contrary. Howbeit to thoſe that ſhall with wiſedome and aduiſed deliberation examine matters according to the rule of reaſon, this interpretation made by <hi>Ameſe</hi> of his vncles actions, can not but ſeeme very raſh and temerous, if not vaine and fooliſh. And to proue that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> did not thinke any thing of ſo ſmall a troupe as that whereof <hi>Moſes</hi> had the commaund, nor did any whit feare the greatneſſe of the daunger, this onely point doth ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently confirme it: becauſe that all things in the countrey of <hi>Dibria</hi> were diſpoſed in as good order, as if the Turkiſh Monarke him ſelfe had bene expected there in perſon. There was nothing at all, neither cattell nor any other thing of worth or value left in the whole countrey: and was not that a peremptorie argument of ſome notable feare, and of a counſell moſt aduiſed, and of a ſound deliberation: ſaue onely to ſuch men whom either fortune, or rather the immutable will of God, hauing predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome mortall and deadly chance, had depriued of all ſenſe and vnderſtanding, as of the principall part of their ſtrength and puiſſance? But I will not any longer blame this credulitie and light beliefe of our enemies, ſeeing it miniſtred occaſion to our Chriſtians of ſo notable and famous a victory, and of immortall renowme &amp; glorie.</p>
            <p>The Baſſa perceiuing that by the flight of the <hi>Epirots,</hi> all hope and occaſion was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him to purchaſe any honour by deeds of armes in that iourney, after dinner was ended, he aſſembled the chiefe Captaines and commaunders of the armie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult and deliberate vpon their occaſions. In this Counſell it was propounded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated,<note place="margin">Councell held by Iſaac Baſſa and the Turkes for their procee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dings againſt Scanderbeg.</note> whether the campe ſhould ſtirre for that day or not, and by what way, maner, and meanes they ſhould purſue the enemie: whether it were beſt to continue in that place, and there to abide till ſuch time as they might haue ſome certaine newes of his attempts and practiſes, and what the enemy intended to do. <hi>Ameſe</hi> and ſome others were of opinion, that they ſhould not ſtirre for that day, but ſtay there till the next morning: notwithſtanding the pluralitie of voyces caried away the matter, and the worſt opinion preuailed againſt the better: for they alledged, that the returne of <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg,</hi> after he had prepared and gotten new ſuccours, would ſcarce be performed in foure dayes: that they ought to take the benefite of the time and the occaſion: that it behoued them to march forward chearefully and roundly in ſacking and harrying the reſidue of the prouince in their paſſage, and not to ſtay till (<hi>Scanderbeg</hi> hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enforced and augmented his troupes, the inhabitants of the countrey might in the meane time (vpon the feare and terrour of the report) flie into the ſtrong holds, and forſaking and leauing their houſes, graunges, and ſheepe-cotes voyde and emptie of all prey and bootie, might by that meanes make their victory vncertaine, and their voyage without all profite and commoditie. Wherefore the trumpet ſounding ſpeedily to horſe, no man ſhewed him ſelfe backward in executing the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Generall: but all of them (teſtifying by their high cryes and clamours, that they did approue the new decree and concluſion of the Councell) in a moment
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:13368:187"/>
truſſed vp their baggage and with Enſignes diſplaied beganne to march forwarde. <hi>Ameſe</hi> likewiſe was not much diſcontented with this their reſolution, but being of a cherefull and good courage againſt all caſualties and occurrences, he imagined there would be litle or no daunger for a day or two, of anie alarmes, or attemptes made by <hi>Scanderbeg:</hi> howbeit, that in matters of warrefare, thoſe counſailes which<note place="margin">Prouidence and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſe in the warres.</note> did forecaſt and doubt moſt daungers, and which were moſt warie and politique, did continually more pleaſe and like him then anie others, becauſe euen in the leaſt errour and ouerſight, there conſiſted no ſmall weight and importance. And therefore he admoniſhed the Baſſa to proceede in theſe affaires prudently and with good order and direction, for feare leaſt by the immoderate couetouſneſſe of the ſouldiers, their prey and bootie might not onely turne to their infamie, but might alſo proue lamentable vnto his people. All theſe thinges therefore were carefully regarded, the battallions and ſquadrons were wiſely ordered and deuided into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe partes, with a ſtreight and expreſſe charge and commaundement, that no man vppon payne of death ſhould diſranke nor disbande him ſelfe out of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell where he had his place aſſigned him, without the ſpeciall leaue and licenſe of the Generall, albeit they ſhould happen to ſee all the wealth and riches of <hi>Epyre</hi> before their eyes: for that where time ſhould ſerue, they ſhould haue free libertie to take whatſoeuer they could ſeize vppon. The ſouldiers for that time ſhewed themſelues verie conformable and obedient in that which was commaunded them, till ſuch time as their couetous fingers (itching at the faire ſhew of the goodly things forbidden them) did finde fit matter whereupon to ſeize and to lay hold. But before the departure of the armie, the Baſſa hauing made his prayers to God, that he would vouchſafe to graunt him the grace to be able to tame the inſolencie of the <hi>Albanois,</hi> and to obtaine the honour of all thoſe trophees and victories befallen to <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> for ſo manie yeares together, he called <hi>Ameſe</hi> vnto him, who was then ordering and<note place="margin">Ameſe proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med king of Epyre by Iſaac Baſſa and the Turkiſh army.</note> diſpoſing of his regiment: and after he had openly graced him with manie goodly prayſes and commendations, he cauſed him by the voices of the ſouldiers to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed king of <hi>Epyre:</hi> and with a long and ſuperfluous inuectiue, deteſting and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracing <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> and all his worthy deedes and notable exploites. <hi>Ameſe</hi> refuſed not this good fortune, but from thence forward he ſhewed himſelfe prompt and cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in all his doing: diſpatching his affaires with ſingular diligence, and currying the fauour and good will of the people both in deedes and in words.</p>
            <p>Theſe things thus done, the hoaſt of the Barbarians (hauing ſent forth their vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currours to diſcouer and beate ouer the plaine countrie) did now beginne to march forwarde: part of their baggage being put before in the vaward, and part following in the rereward of their armie. The way which they tooke was (by the conduct and direction of <hi>Ameſe</hi>) to that part of <hi>Epyre</hi> which lyeth to the Eaſtward of <hi>Croy,</hi> and was diſtant from thence about 80. miles: the which for that it was leaſt furniſhed with forces, did ſeeme to be more eaſily expoſed to prey and pillage: beſides they had an intention alſo, that as their troupes ſhould approch neerer vnto the walles (if occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion did ſo ſerue) they might all vnder one make themſelues Lordes of the towne. Neuertheleſſe by reaſon of the continuall and vehement heate, they went not farre that day, neither did they finde vppon the fieldes, any the leaſt recompence of their paine and trauell: ſo wilde and waſt did the countrie appeare on all partes, as if it had beene a meere and ſolitarie deſart. This made the <hi>Mahometan</hi> to redouble his feare and ſuſpition, beſides that the ambition of the man did mightily trouble and torment him, leaſt that the Chriſtian eyther by his abſence, or by his continuall delayes refuſing the fight, ſhould conſtraine him to returne vnto <hi>Constantinople</hi>
               <pb n="362" facs="tcp:13368:188"/>
without any purchaſe or increaſe of honour and reputation. For there was no kinde of bootie to be found at all (which ordinarily, is eſteemed to be a part of the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie) neither had they any ready meanes without artillerie, to get them any honour by the beſieging of any townes. As for the waſting and ſpoiling of the corne, frutes and trees: the burning and fireing of townes, and ſuch like calamities, being the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie appendants of the warres, they are commonly and oftentimes reſerued to the laſt and extreame rigour: for that in very deede, they doe ſeeme rather to teſtifie and to declare a certaine rage and furie, then any benefit or commoditie of reuenge. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they had ſome hope alſo (ſuch as it was) to come to fight with <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> and to bring the Prouince vnder their ſubiection, if ſo be he durſt preſent himſelfe to the combat. And theſe (it may be) were the eſpeciall cauſes and conſiderations, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and withheld them from ſuch acts of hoſtilitie.</p>
            <p>The heate of the ſunne growing by litle and litle to be abated, by reaſon of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyning towards the Weſt, the ſweete and pleaſant ſhade yeelded great refreſhing to the bodies of the ſouldiers, who were ſore wearied, and well neere ſpent with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamitie of heate, of harde trauell, and long iournyes. To the intent therefore they might take the benefite of ſo ſweete a refreſhing, they doubled their way and began to ride a good round trot. But the Baſſa commaunded them to make a ſtand, not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to paſſe on any further, by reaſon that the night approached and drew neere. In the meane time him ſelfe in perſon with part of his armie encamped on an high mountaine which lay aloft on the left hand, after he had firſt cauſed <hi>Ameſe</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine horſemen to take a viewe of the conueniencie and ſituation of the place. The reſidue of his armie was lodged all alongeſt the valley, and in other places in as great ſafetie as might be: and there was ordained good watch and warde, ſeuerall courtes of garde being placed both in the plaine and vppon the mountaines round about, eſpecially on that ſide that lay towardes <hi>Liſſa,</hi> and which they moſt ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. In this place, the night being thus ſpent and conſumed, the next day by the common aduiſe and conſent of them all, they purpoſed to take their iourney into * <hi>Emathia.</hi>

            <p>Here hath it beene auerred by ſome writers, that certaine Peyſants of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie<note place="margin">Peyſants of Albany ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed by the Turkes.</note> of <hi>Albanie</hi> were ſurpriſed as they deſcended vndiſcreetely out of the forreſts next adioyning: and being put to tormentes, for feare of death they did reueale ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> his ſecretes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For you muſt note, that there be in <hi>Epyre</hi> manie mountaines full of ſuch huge thickets, ſo wooddie, and ſo difficult of acceſſe, that the people of the countrie doe holde them ſelues in more ſafetie in thoſe places, then in the beſt and ſtrongeſt fortreſſes: and there is no power nor puiſſance of the enemie (be it neuer ſo great) that can driue them to forſake thoſe places. Some alſo haue added this moreouer, that certaine fugitiues came the ſame night to yeelde themſelues vnto <hi>Scanderbeg:</hi> and that certaine Scoutes or Eſpyals of the<note place="margin">Eſpials or Scouts of the Turkes ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banois.</note> Turkes, falling into the handes of the Chriſtian courtes of garde, were put to the ſword, excepting one onely: who being by good happe ſaued aliue and brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King (who was then preparing for his iorney againſt the next morning) did enforme him of manie things particularly concerning the purpoſe of the enemie: by meanes whereof it may be eaſily imagined, and not without ſhewe of credite, that he was a principall meane and authour of the victorie of the Chriſtians which followed ſoone after. For my part it ſhall ſuffice, that without eyther approuing it for a truth, or reproouing it as fabulous, I haue ſimply made recitall of it. And therefore referring the truth thereof to be iudged by others, I will betake my ſelfe to the proſecuting of thoſe affaires, which hauing bene for a while intermitted vpon

            <p>You haue heard how the flight of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> towardes the towne of <hi>Liſſa,</hi> was not ſuch as the aduerſe partie had imagined: but hauing nowe gotten farre out of the ſight of the enemie, he went vnto thoſe partes of the countrie which laye vppon the frontiers of <hi>Albanie,</hi> where were manie and diuerſe paſſages into the Prouince by which the enemie might eaſily be ſurpriſed. There did he abide for that day, attending the ſetting of the Sunne: and then leauing there his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, and being accompanied with a verie fewe horſemen, he went vppe to the toppes of certaine mountaines, from whence he might well diſcouer all the plaine countrie about * <hi>Emathia.</hi> Then calling to remembraunce the ſpeeches of his<note place="margin">Or Pharſalia.</note> priſoners afore mentioned, hee diſpoſed and beſtowed certaine Scoutes vppon the<note place="margin">Scouts placed vpon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines by Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Turkiſh army.</note> toppes and edges of the mountaines, who hauing little ſtreamers or penons (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the manner is) were admoniſhed and charged to holde them vp aloft, that they might be ſeene wauing in the ayre, and that towardes the ſame ſide where they ſhould ſee the enemie encamped, they ſhould throw downe thoſe penons from the toppe to the bottome. Other ſignall then this they had not at that time, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by fires, nor other watches for the night. True it is, that the moſt worthie, and in a manner, the beſt ſouldiers were appointed to ſtande Scout in that place, amongeſt whom was <hi>Peic Manuell,</hi> a Gentleman of no leſſe wiſedome and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,<note place="margin">Peic Manuell.</note> then of hardineſſe and good reſolution in deedes of armes: becauſe that the weight and conſequence of their whole affaires did conſiſt in the diligence and truſt of theſe Sentinels. This done, he returned in the dead of the night into his campe,<note place="margin">Ambuſcado dreſſed by Scanderbeg a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Iſaac Baſſa and the Turkes.</note> where hauing paſt the moſt part of the ſame in reſt and ſilence, he diſlodged verie ſecretly without any noiſe, and he had not ridden farre with all his forces, but that he put himſelfe in ambuſcado in the bottome of a certaine valley verie neere vnto that watch which we laſt ſpake of: determining not to depart, or to remoue from thence before he had deliberated and taken counſell for his proceedings, and that he might take his directions, by the ſigne and token which ſhould be made vnto him by thoſe ſtreamers.</p>
            <p>It was ſcant fayre day breake, but that the Baſſa drewe his troupes foorth of the campe, hauing a purpoſe and determination by preuenting the heate of the day to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the plaines of <hi>Emathia,</hi> where (as he vnderſtood) was remayning ſome boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that would be abandoned to the prey of the ſouldiers. Not pawſing therefore vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">Iſaac Baſſa with the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh armie in the plain fields of Pharſalia.</note> the matter, he beganne to march forward verie early, whileſt the leaues and graſſe of the fieldes were yet moyſt with the dewe of the morning: and troade with their feet, greedie of prey and pillage, vpon thoſe fieldes that are euen yet famous through the bloud and ſlaughter of the auncient <hi>Romaines.</hi> But to the intent that a caſe and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident ſo maruellous, and ſo ſhortly after enſuing might not be without ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, there be many who doe affirme, that the Generall his ſtandard-bearer, hauing<note place="margin">Signes and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the great ſlaughter in the future battell betwene the Turkes and the Chriſtians.</note> ſtumbled at the ruines of an old wall (as there are many ſuch in thoſe quarters which doe bound the landes and poſſeſſions of priuate perſons) both horſe and man with the ſtandard alſo fell ſo rudely to the ground, that his companions were conſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to take him vp halfe dead, and to helpe him againe to horſebacke. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they made not any account of the matter, but onely tooke it as a warning to the reſidue to looke better to their feete, and to eſchewe that place. And it may be, that we alſo ought to make as little account and reckoning of ſuch ſignes and tokens, rather then to followe the vanitie of ſuch fonde coniectures in this accident: ſeeing that both the libertie of mans free will, leading and guyding him in ſuch
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:13368:189"/>
actions, and the good doctrine and inſtructions of Chriſtian religion doe ſeeme to argue and teach vs the contrarie. But yet one other thing there is, wherein I knowe not howe I ſhould gaineſay it, or diſſent from others who haue affirmed, that the Vultures, and Rauens, and ſuch like fowles which vſe to frequent and hunt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter carrion and dead carkaſſes, did flie in ſuch aboundance into thoſe places, (as it were foreſhewing the great effuſion of bloud that was likely ſhortly to enſue) that the verie heauens ſeemed in a manner to be darkened with their huge num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. Beſides, there was an other verie ſtraunge and wonderfull ſigne (which I had almoſt forgotten) and which I ſee no reaſon why it ſhoulde be neglected or nor regarded, and that was, that in the ende of the ſpring that ſelfe ſame yeare, (as it is reported by them that ſawe it) the heauens did raine downe bloud vppon the earth Of which ſignes, there is not any of them that proceeded from the acte of anie man or earthly creature: neither was it in the power of mans counſell or prudence, to foreſee, or to preuent the effect of thoſe accidents.</p>
            <p>Manie are the influences which did deſcende downe from the heauens by certaine<note place="margin">Diſcourſe of the author vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on celeſtiall ſignes &amp; prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtications of future acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</note> ſecret and vnknowen cauſes of thinges, and it is often ſeene, that ſundry both good and euill chaunces are manifeſted vnto vs by the operation of the ſtarres and the celeſtiall bodies, the which whileſt we doe diſdaine to obſerue, wee doe referre them to meere accidents and caſualtie, and we doe not vſe eyther the ſeruice and miniſterie of our owne prudence, nor the induſtrie of our owne counſelles to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe vnto vs the fauour and bleſſing of the diuine bountie, nor to turne away the anger and threatnings of the heauens. For what reaſon haue we to thinke, that this extraordinarie flight of ſo manie birdes and fowles of the ayre, or thoſe ſhewers of bloud, which fell from the heauens ſhould denote or foreſhewe the ruine and deſtruction of the Infidels rather then of our owne friendes the Chriſtians? were it not perhappes, that by the ſage aduiſe and counſaile, and by the temporizing of the Chriſtian Chiefetaine, and dexteritie of his good inuention: The ſtarres were (as it were) forced, and this notable victorie was in a manner purchaſed from the<note place="margin">Sentence.</note>

            <p>The entrie of the <hi>Paynims</hi> within the plaine countrie of <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> was quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſted and made knowen to the inhabitantes by the ſound of the artillerie, in the fortreſſes next adioyning: giuing thereby an aduertiſement to ſome of the people, who were iſſued out with their beaſtes to feede them in the fieldes. Vpon this ſignall and token giuen them, you may imagine that there was none of them, but made haſte ſpeedily to auoide ſo great and imminent a daunger: and it is to be ſuppoſed, that ſome of them which were diſperſed and ſcattered fartheſt off, did make ſo great haſte to free themſelues from the enemie, that they left part of their beaſtes for a prey and bootie vnto them, not being well able vppon ſuch an extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie (wherein they were) to vſe conuenient ſpeede, to ſaue and preſerue them from their violence and furie. At the ſame inſtant likewiſe, the ſtreamers which were placed for a token vpon the mountaines, did giue <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> occaſion to diſlodge<note place="margin">Scanderbeg coaſteth the armie of the Turkes with his forces c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Then alſo putting him ſelfe againe in an ambuſh with all his forces, and attending till it were night, he reſted him ſelfe neere vnto a certaine hill, named by the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitantes, <hi>Tumenistiola:</hi> after that he had firſt ſent foorth ſome to ſtande ſcoutes, and<note place="margin">Scanderbeg putteth himſelf in an ambuſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do neere the mountaine Tumeniſtiola.</note> had ſet the watch, ordering all thinges in good and conuenient ſort. The <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans</hi> in this meane while were not idle, but they ſpent and employed, not onely the morning, but the whole courſe of their march all that day in ouerrunning, ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and ranſacking of the plaine countrie, being growen to a certaine contempt and licentiouſneſſe which by litle and litle was engendred amongſt their troupes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſaw no bodie to reſiſt or to encounter them in the way. All this did <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi> diſcerne full well, but his deliberation was not to purſue after them with ſo ſmall forces, they being ſcattered and diſperſed in a plaine that was ſo large and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, nor yet was he minded to giue the onſet vpon them in ſuch ſort as he might any way endaunger his forces in the fight, but he did rather deſire that their audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and licentiouſneſſe ſhould ſtill encreaſe and grow more and more. In that manner therefore hauing followed them all that night, he forbare to touch, or in any ſort to meddle with their campe, by reaſon of the difficulties of the places, being not able, but with great trouble, to carrie his troupes in the darke through thoſe thicke and huge forreſtes and woods: as alſo becauſe he aymed at a certaine draught and policie of warre, which he had of long time before conceiued in his thoughtes, by meanes of certaine drummes, trumpets, and clarions (whereof ſhall be ſaid more hereafter) and by which he did reſerue himſelfe to a ſtraunge and miraculous kinde of combat. For this cauſe the Infidels being ſuffered to reſt in quiet, they ſpent that night in diuerſe pleaſures and paſtimes: and euen <hi>Ameſe</hi> alſo tooke a great ioy and contentment to ſee himſelfe carried and attended (though ſomewhat too ſoone for his honour) tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the campe, with diuers ſongs of ioy and meriment amongſt the common ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, as if he had alreadie obtained the ſoueraigntie and peaceable poſſeſſion of the eſtate of <hi>Albanie.</hi> Not that their minds were wholly freed from all feare or ſuſpition,</p>

            </p>
            <p>The darkeneſſe of the night being now chaſed away by the comming of the day light, the Turkes were prouiding and preparing themſelues to follow on their roads and excurſions: and therefore by the breake of day diſplaying their Enſignes, they fell to ſpoyling and robbing that part of the countrie which remained as yet vnſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, filling it with all kinds of outrage and beaſtly crueltie: and their hoaſt with their<note place="margin">Iſaac and the Turks encampe betwene the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of Mathia and the waters of Albulae.</note> baggage alſo remoued to a certaine plaine lying betweene the riuer of <hi>Mathia</hi> and thoſe waters which the inhabitants name <hi>Albulae:</hi> placing their gardes and Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels towardes <hi>Liſſa</hi> only, where they doubted and imagined the greateſt daunger. At the foote of the mountaine <hi>Tumeniſta,</hi> which hath his aſpect to the Weſt, towardes the open champion were placed certaine horſemen to aſſure that paſſage. As for their campe, it was excellently well fortified: for the one halfe of their armie remained there ſtill for the garde and defence thereof: and I finde that the <hi>Baſſa</hi> himſelfe, and manie of the chiefeſt and moſt principall perſons of the armie did continue and abide there with the campe, whileſt that <hi>Ameſe</hi> (as being more skilfull and better practiſed in thoſe marches) had the conduct of thoſe forces that went abroad to forrage and prey<note place="margin">Suffades.</note> the countrey, with the which all at randome he ranne vp euen to the <hi>Suffades</hi> (as they tearme them) and to the ſeacoaſts. The husbandman and the peyſant had not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawen and conueyed away all from the fury, ſpoyle, and couetouſneſſe of the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, becauſe they did not thinke that the King would haue ſuffered them ſo long to vſe that licenſe and libertie, and to haue beene vnmet withall. True it is, that he might at that time haue done ſome worthie and notable exploit, whileſt their forces were ſo deuided a ſunder, if he had roundly inuaded their campe: but he was not yet come ſo neere them, neither could it ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueniently haue bene done, but that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which were harrying and ouerrunning the countrie, vpon the noiſe of the alarme might haue beene called home, and ſo they might eaſily haue encloſed the <hi>Albanois</hi> betwene both their powers. But hunger and the heate of the day hauing now cauſed them to returne to their campe, the bootie was deuided amongſt the ſouldiers: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, it was but of litle or ſmall value, and did rather ſharpen their appetites, then ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie or content them. By this time were our men alſo drawen together, and being gotten vp to the toppes of the mountaines, they were ſeized of the aduantage of the place: whereupon with their armes nowe readie in their handes, they did prepare themſelues to call the <hi>Mahometans</hi> to an account of their voyage and iorney which they had taken.</p>
            <p>If you had ſeene how <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> was buſied and did beſtirre himſelfe, you might<note place="margin">An ellegant and excellent compariſon.</note> aptly haue compared him to one, who expecting at his houſe ſome great companie of gueſts, and being to make them ſome magnificent and ſumptuous banquet, with moſt exquiſite dainties and viandes prepared more then ordinary, dareth not to truſt his ſeruants, nor yet to referre the care thereof either to his friends, or to his wife, but will ſee it done with his owne hands: ordaining, fitting, and diſpoſing all things moſt
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:13368:190"/>
carefully: and with a doubtfull countenaunce caſteth his eyes vpon all the diſhes, and vppon all partes of the table, eſpecially if by reaſon of the meane eſtate of the man, the preparation be more ſparye then is conuenient for the number of his gueſtes: and ſetting out all things to the beſt ſhew, with a skilfull and diligent hand, he doth ſo amplifie and encreaſe them, as they may at the leaſt ſatisfie and fill their eyes, if not the hands and bellies of the banquetters. In like manner the King of <hi>Epyre</hi> courſing and galloping vp and downe the hilles and mountaines neare adioyning, ſtayed not long in any one place, but he placeth <hi>Moſes</hi> in one quarter, and <hi>Tanuſee</hi> in another: the <hi>Streezes</hi> on this ſide, and others on that ſide: and appointing vnto euerie man his particular charge and office, he admoniſheth and inſtructeth them: and not truſting in the ſufficiencie and capacitie of any of them in a caſe of that conſequence, and in that importance of his affaires; ſometimes he goeth before, ſometimes he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth after: and to be breife, he maketh his handes and his eyes the witneſſes of all that is done. He vieweth and reuieweth all his troupes, he examineth if all be well, and ſtill is he deuiſing and caſting, how to diſpoſe and order all things to the beſt. And to the intent that the terrible obiect which he prouided for his enemies might the more aſtoniſh and confound them: he vſed this ſleight and inuention which I will ſhew you.</p>
            <p>To euerie ſquadron he aſſigned a great number of trumpettes, drummes and ſuch<note place="margin">Stratageme of Scanderbeg.</note> like inſtruments of warre, more then is ordinarily he vſed any troups, the which he had expreſly prouided of purpoſe. After this he ordered his armie both horſe &amp; foot according to the commoditie of the place, and the quantitie of his forces. He reſerued for his owne regiment the moſt part of his armie to wit, 4000. horſe, and the like number of footemen, with the which he went without delay, and ſeized vppon <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meniſta.</hi>

            <p>The Baſſa his armie, namely they which were wearied with their long and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous<note place="margin">Securitie and negligence of the Turkes.</note> incurſions in harrying and preying of the countrie in the morning, at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne were laid all along, and did reſt themſelues here and there ouer the large plaine, hauing left their horſes feeding without either ſaddles or bridles: beſides that, few or none kept neare their enſignes or any good order. Some laye in the ſhadowe and made merrie with that which they had purchaſed: others hauing fed at full, lay wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing on the graſſe and ſlept without all feare or ſuſpition. Some paſſing away the time in plaies and ſportes of all ſortes and vſuall amongeſt ſouldiers, did ioyfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile their eyes of ſleepe, and the extreame heat of ſummer: albeit they were ſcarce able to hold vp their heads for wearineſſe and want of ſleepe: for then was the worſt time both of the yeare and of the day, by reaſon of the extreame heat of the moneth of Iuly, and the height of the ſunne which was not then paſt the middeſt of the heauen, which made their watches &amp; courts of gard alſo to be as negligent in the other parts of the campe. For amongſt them likewiſe, euery man was bent to take his eaſe and to ſpend away the time in mirth. No man had his armes nor his horſe in a readines: but the moſt part hauing caſt away all feare and doubt of the enemie, had laied aſide alſo the care and conſideration of all good order and martiall diſcipline.</p>

The counſell was deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into two diuerſe opinions: one was, that they ſhould ouerrunne all the Prouince with ſword and fire, and ſo make the ruines and ſpoiles of the countrie to remaine as
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:13368:191"/>
the marks of their victory: the other (which was propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by <hi>Ameſe,</hi>) was, that they ſhould march right towardes <hi>Croy</hi> to ſound the wils of the inhabitants whether they would ſubmit themſelues to the nephue of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> &amp; accept of his gouernment: &amp; that they ſhould terrifie them by threats and menaces in caſe they did refuſe to harken vnto them: as that they ſhould ſee the totall ruine and deſtruction of <hi>Albanie,</hi> &amp; a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall ſiege before their walles, and that in the end they ſhould be enforced to endure the yoke of a moſt miſerable and ſhamefull ſeruitude and bondage: That they ſhould not build vpon the ſlowe ſuccours of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> nor truſt to their fond counſelles, who ſhould perſwade them to attend and depend vpon the hope and expectation of his long lingring preſence. This latter aduiſe was approued as the moſt certaine and beſt opinion, and the other was in no part followed: onely they made ſome ſtay for a while, and thought it not yet beſt to remoue their campe till ſuch time as the feruentneſſe of the heate, and the wearineſſe of their bodies were ſomewhat abated and refreſhed. But <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> did not any longer temporize: for hauing both ſatisfied and inſtructed his eyes from the toppe of <hi>Tumenista,</hi> he animated and diſpoſed his<note place="margin">Scanderbeg marcheth to fight with Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac Baſſa and the Turkiſh armie.</note> ſouldiers, telling them what order they ſhould obſerue and keepe: how they ſhould by their inuaſions terrifie their enemies, and on what ſide they ſhould charge and preſſe vpon them. But firſt of all beholding that court of garde of thoſe Turks which lay at the foote of the mountaine, ſome of them ſleeping ſoundly, other keeping but ſlender watch and ward, himſelfe deſcended in great ſilence by the other ſide of the mountaine with eight men onely, and had the cutting of all their throats, leauing<note place="margin">A court of gard of the Turkes cut in pieces by Scanderbeg.</note> them there to keepe an euerlaſting watch, one of them onely being excepted, whom the ſwiftneſſe of his horſe, and his flight ſaued from the like ſlaughter. By this meanes the other troups of the Chriſtians (after that this court of gard was diſpatched) began to deſcend vpon the plaine vnknowen to the enemie. He that was eſcaped, went run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the meane while with all poaſting ſpeed towardes his fellowes, and with a fearefull crie, he filled all the hoaſt of the Barbarians, giuing them the allarme, and telling them: that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> was there: that the gard was cut in pieces, and that all the forces of the Chriſtians were comming, and were euen at hand. Hardly would the Turks haue beleeued theſe newes, if his feare had not giuen them ſufficient likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood thereof through the death of his companions. For neither did they feare any danger on that ſide, neither did they doubt of the ſo ſudden comming of the enemie. But <hi>Ameſe</hi> was not of that mind: for he was eaſily perſwaded of the truth of this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arme: and therefore haſting ſpeedily and readily to his troupes, he enforced them quickly to mount on horſebacke, &amp; encouraged them to the vttermoſt of his power. Many of them were wakened, partly by the noiſe of the enemies comming vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and partly by their companions, who cauſed them to leaue ſleeping. For nowe that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> ſaw his ambuſhments to be diſcouered, he commaunded his infanterie preſently to follow him with as great ſpeed and celeritie as was poſſible: and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately as the enemie was preparing to receiue him, he charged and gaue the onſet v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them moſt furiouſly with the huge clamours and horrible cries of his ſouldiers, the ſame being augmented and encreaſed with the brimme noiſe of the drummes,<note place="margin">Scanderbeg ſurprizeth the Turkiſh campe by a ſudden inuaſion.</note> trumpets and tamborins which were purpoſely placed on all ſides to annoy and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the enemie by the conceipt and imagination of a great and mightie armie: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to giue aduertiſements to the other bands that lay cloſe embusked in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines. <hi>Ameſe</hi> being ſeconded with his owne regiment of horſemen, and with certen others who had bene appointed for the garde of the campe, was the firſt that made head againſt the Chriſtians, and did moſt ſtoutly ſuſtaine the firſt charge. Many alſo came thither on foote, hauing no leiſure in ſo great haſt and extremitie, to ſaddle and
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:13368:191"/>
make readie their horſes. The tumult and the terrour was wonderfull in all partes of the campe, and the Turkes ſtood as men mightely amazed and aſtoniſhed: ſo great and extreame was the feare which ſeized vpon them at the verie ſight and name of <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi> The Baſſa ſtood firme within his campe and would not moue a foot, till ſuch time as he ſaw all his ſquadrons in order and good array, and that his flanckes were well defended with treble forces of the choiſeſt horſemen well armed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. But during theſe preparations, it ſeemed that the heauen &amp; earth were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded by reaſon of this new and vnexpected alarme, and with the ſtrange clamours &amp; diuerſe ſounds of the ambuſhments now diſcouered. On euerie ſide did the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and next vallies reſound with the noiſe, ſometimes of the men, ſometimes of the trumpets, drummes and clarions: and ſometimes with the maruellous ſound of infinite harguebuſſes, which did incredibly augment the feare and terror both in the hearts and in the eyes of the Turkes: who eſteeming themſelues as men loſt and vtterly vndone, did thinke that the power and puiſſance of all <hi>Epyre, Sclauonie,</hi> and their confederates, had bene aſſembled and conſpired together to their deſtruction. And therefore they began to flie on all hands before that euer <hi>Moſes</hi> with his troups alone could get downe into the plaine from the mountaines: and yet did not their flight ſeeme ſure and ſafe enough vnto them, by reaſon that all the wayes and paſſages were in a manner ſhut vp and taken from them. Beſides, euen their horſes being fray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in diuerſe places, did either ſhake off their headſtals, or breake their bridles, and being thus feared, did ſcape out of the hands of thoſe who were making them rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. Neuertheleſſe <hi>Ameſe</hi> miſtruſting the ſtratagemes and the politique inuentions<note place="margin">Ameſe encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth the Turks againſt the Epirots.</note> of his vncle, did ſoone and eaſily comprehend this his cunning and ſubtiltie. And therefore he cried out vnto his companie on all ſides: that they ſhould not in any caſe be affraied of theſe falſe alarmes: that theſe deuiſes were for the moſt part the onely<q> hope and refuge of ſuch as had but weake and ſmall forces: that they ſhould quietly attend and ſuſtaine their enemies, without any miſdoubt of theſe vaine clamours, and that the iangling noiſe of their trumpets, and other ſuch braſen inſtruments, and the ecchoes and outcries of their fearefull voices, were but fruteleſſe and idle ſhewes pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely doubled and augmented to put them in feare and terror. With theſe perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he drew many of them out of euery companie,</q> yet in a great doubt and mamme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, being vnreſolued, whether it were beſt to flie or to hold good againſt the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. For neither did the one ſeeme to be honeſt in the preſence of their Captaine, and things being yet in good eſtate: neither were they of ſufficient ſtrength to reſiſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their enemies, their courages being diſmayed and abated in ſo ſudden an aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: inſomuch, that it would haue required a long time to haue confirmed them in a good reſolution, and to haue put them in full heart and courage againe.</p>
            <p>All this notwithſtanding the <hi>Baſſa</hi> being no leſſe reſolute then <hi>Ameſe,</hi> cauſed his<note place="margin">The battell of Pharſalia be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Iſaac Baſſa and Scanderbeg.</note> Enſignes to march on and entred the combat with notable reſolution. As he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncing himſelfe to the aide and ſuccours of <hi>Ameſe,</hi> in hope if he met with <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi> to oppreſſe him: <hi>Moſes</hi> and the reſidue of the Chriſtians following cloſe at their backes, were now come vpon the open plaine, and helde him ſhort from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding any further. Neuertheleſſe the <hi>Dibrian</hi> cauſed his men to make a ſtand and to holde bridle, ſtaying till <hi>Tanuſee</hi> and <hi>Piec Manuell</hi> (who had the charge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of a ſquadron of archers and harguebuſſiers) were aduaunced and came for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as farre foorth as himſelfe. They being now drawen and vnited all together, the battell beganne to grow rough and furious on all ſides, and the horſemen from all partes did ruſh violently vpon their enemies. The footmen for their partes alſo wrought wonders; and the harguebuſſiers plaied vpon the troupes of the <hi>Paynims</hi>
               <pb n="370" facs="tcp:13368:192"/>
where they ſaw them thickeſt not beſtowing any of their ſhot in vaine. Whereupon the Baſſa being hardly preſſed and annoied with the mortall ſhot of thoſe bullettes, was conſtrained to giue backewardes: and being repulſed and driuen to retire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his trenches, he ſawe his ſquadrons diſordered and out of rancke. Then our footmen caſting their bowes away at their backes, and leauing their harguebuſſes, beganne verie nimbly and lightly to come to handie blowes and to vſe their ſwords, ſtill following and preſſing hard vpon the Turkes in wounding and killing of thoſe which were next vnto them, and whom they found ſcattered and out of order. Great was the ſlaughter and butcherie throughout all the companies, and much blood was ſhed both of them that fledde, and of them alſo that fought. But he that had ſeene how <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> and his troupes did beſtirre themſelues on their partes, would haue wondred and admired at the ſight and ſpectacle of ſo many miſchieues, and mortall miſfortunes that repreſented themſelues on that ſide of the fielde. For it was another manner of ſlaughter that was made there then in any other parte of the battell, by reaſon that their forces and power being the greateſt, might the more eaſily worke the greater effectes.

All the hardineſſe and audacitie, or the feare and flight of the Turkes on that ſide did wholly depend vpon the reſolution of the Chriſtian fugitiue, who with a countenance more and more aſſured, made head againſt the <hi>Albanois:</hi> and one while by his voice, another <q>while by the dexteritie and valure of his valiant deedes and prowes, he would aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe<note place="margin">Ameſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth the Turks in the battell.</note> &amp; will his troups to hold good, and only for a litle while to endure with patience, til ſuch time as the firſt fury &amp; violence of the <hi>Albanois</hi> were broken, ſaying that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he would vndoubtedly deliuer them an eaſie and vnbloudie victory: that the ſmall numbers of the Chriſtians had nothing to hope on but the furie of their firſt charge &amp; onſet, the which being once paſt &amp; cooled, their forces alſo &amp; their courage would ſoone faint and faile, and come to nothing.</q> This did he as long as he could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the conflict, hoping that the other handes which were diſperſed ouer the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion would rally themſelues and renue the combat.

            <p>If theſe ſpeeches and perſwaſions had the power to chafe and incenſe the coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Chriſtians, much more were they encouraged by the conſideration of that precious recompence which they ſaw prouided for them by meanes of the victorie, and which they had in a manner alreadie gotten.

And the Generall of the Infidels with all the reſt had quite forſaken and abandoned their campe. All thoſe which were found on foote (excepting ſuch as by good happe had<note place="margin">Victorie of Scanderbeg. againſt Iſaac Baſſa and the Turkes in the battell of Phar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſalia.</note> found either their owne or ſome other mens horſes and ſo did eſcape) were either ſlaine or made priſoners, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> (as long as he ſawe anie poſſibilitie or likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood that the enemie might againe ioyne or reenforce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues) did follow and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue hard after the Baſſa: but he ſaued himſelfe by the fauour and ſwiftneſſe of his horſe who caried him cleere away out of the ſight of them that had him in chaſe.

            <p>This battell, (or howſoeuer you liſte to tearme it) continued vntill ſuch time as the night comming vppon them, did finde them to be both Conquerours, and to haue the victorie.

Thus was the common and vſuall prouerbe verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. That there is a great diſtance betweene the cuppe and the lippe. Many horſes were found there alſo readie ſaddled and brideled, as though they had ſtayed and attended for their maiſters to mount vppon their backes, but they ſawe them ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead at their feete. But this notable ſpectacle of this new accident and euent, and an euident teſtimonie of the mutabilitie and inconſtancie of fortune, was <hi>Ameſe</hi> the King his nephewe. Of late he being a King of three or foure dayes continuance,<note place="margin">Ameſe brought priſoner to Scanderbeg</note> with ſingular arrogancie and inſolencie, did ouerrunne all the fieldes of <hi>Emathia,</hi> and was attended vppe and downe the Turkiſh campe with the handes and voices of the common ſouldiours: but nowe behold how with his handes bound behind him, with out any wordes ſpeaking, and his countenance caſt downe, he is ledde towardes his vncle, to be made a ſpectacle, to the eyes of the common ſouldiours: who being victorious againſt him, were aſſembled to contemplate and looke vpon him, inuiting them all to commiſerate his miſhap: and ſome of them to lament and bewaile his hard for me.</p>

There was a great number found dead vpon the ſhoares and banckes of the next riuer, and of the waters of <hi>Albulae,</hi> according as their feare and flight had caried them. The fieldes of <hi>Emathia</hi> (which had bene of old times of antiquitie much renowmed for many great and notable battels) were made much more famous by this iorney and by this great ſlaughter of the Turkes. The greateſt part of the day was emploied in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying and enterring of the dead bodies: ſo that by this meanes, the reſort of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny birdes and foules to that place (as is before mentioned) fell out to very litle or no purpoſe at all. Theſe things thus accompliſhed, the <hi>Albanians</hi> tooke their way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes <hi>Croie:</hi> for hauing gotten ſuch good ſtore of pillage and ſped ſo well, they tooke no great care of forraging: beſides that, the territorie of the enemie was a good way off; and many of them alſo (as you may geſſe) were not eſcaped ſcotfree and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wounded from this long fight and conflict.</p>

Theſe two at the beginning of the battell, had agreed to ioyne together in the Fortune of that daies iourney, and whatſoeuer booty was gotten by either of them, ſhould be deuided and ſhared equally betweene them. After which, hauing plied themſelues well in there buſines, and hauing made a good hand, when they came to make partition, they fell to ſome difference and altercation vpon the matter: and (as is vſuall in ſuch caſes) from thence to iniurious and reproachfull ſpeeches of the one againſt the other: ſo that in the end comming to try the matter by the ſword, they were ready to cut each the others throat, for the deciding of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie, &amp; to know who ſhould be the maiſter of that which was the cauſe of their debate. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> being aduertiſed hereof, cauſed both of them to be called before him: and demaunding of them if they had dined, they told him, yea: then ſmiling (as<q>

            <p>As the <hi>Albanois</hi> were now marching towards <hi>Croy,</hi> there met with them a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the countrey inhabitants, and others who had hidden themſelues in the next forreſts till the end of the fight, beſides the citizens of <hi>Croy</hi> alſo: all which with a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull<note place="margin">Triumph of Scanderbeg for the ouerthrow of Ameſe and the Turkes in the battell of Pharſalia.</note> ioy, with high cries and ſounds of inſtrumentes went with them on to <hi>Croy,</hi> ſo as a man could hardly haue ſeene a more goodly triumph: nor a more pompous ſhew: ſo gloriouſly and triumphantly did they march into the towne.

Likewiſe the pauili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, tents, and canapies of the Turkiſh Generall being of purple colour, and making a goodly ſhew and oſtentation, were caried by ſome of the ſouldiours of the <hi>Albanians,</hi> who bare them aloft, openly diſplaied, and ſpred abroad of purpoſe, as if they had bene ready dreſſed and prepared for the Generall: which gaue no ſmall grace and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the reſt. <hi>Ameſe</hi> had moſt earneſtly and humbly entreated his vncle not to leade him to <hi>Croy</hi> in this infamous and miſerable eſtate of a ſlaue and captiue: and therefore he was ſuffered to goe at liberty, and in another manner of order then as a priſoner, marching ſide by ſide with the <hi>Saniacke</hi> that was captiue alſo.

The only pleaſure and whole delight of all men both ſtrangers &amp; others, was to walke and wander vp and downe thoſe victorious fields, and often to viſit &amp; ſuruey the grounds which did ſeeme yet to cary a froath with the bloud of the <hi>Mahometanes:</hi> their onely ſolace and recreation was to enquire of euery particularity, where ſuch an ambuſcado was laid in couert, and on which ſide the enemy was ſurprized &amp; aſſailed? euen <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> himſelfe was no leſſe amaſed &amp; maruelled at the ſtrangenes of this victory: for by a ſhamefull confeſsion of his owne feare, within a while after, he did allow the honour of this iourney, vnto his enemy: for when he ſaw his forces ſo broken &amp; diſperſed, and had learned by the Baſſa the order of the battel, and the occaſion of his ouerthrow, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though perhaps there were many points wherein both the Generall &amp; all the hoſt did deſerue worthily to be blamed) yet without any maner of reproofe giuen them, or in any ſort inueighing againſt them: he ſwallowed vp in ſilence (contrary to his wonted maner) the grief &amp; bitternes of his ſorrow and diſcontentment. It behooued him now to thinke vpon the redeeming of the priſoners, eſpecially of the <hi>Saniake,</hi> whoſe impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment vexed and grieued him extreamely, and made him greatly aſhamed, in regard of his degree and the greatneſſe of his merites.

Many alſo (vpon the former reaſons of the wars wherewith the <hi>Sultan</hi> was encombred) thought it not amiſſe (and they had reaſon) if that a truce for certaine yeares were demanded of <hi>Scanderbeg:</hi> during the which, the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire might breath it ſelfe from ſo many miſchiefes, and till ſuch time as they might finde ſome better oportunity, to bring this fierce and vnruly enemy vnder the yoke of ſubiection: for the ſecond opinion ſeemed not to be allowable, becauſe in the middeſt of ſo many ambuſhments, and againſt ſuch ſtirring ſpirits as the <hi>Albanians</hi> were, there was no ſafety for any weake and ſmall garriſon: and to ſend thither anie ſtrong and puiſſant forces amiddeſt ſo many newe accidents, and in ſuch commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and troubles of the warres, could not be done conueniently without a thouſand diſcommodities. This councell being the moſt profitable, albeit ſmally honourable, and in ſome ſort too too baſe and ſeruile, was beſt allowed by the greater part of the aſſembly. <hi>Mahomet</hi> for his part though this counſell did not a litle diſpleaſe him, who had alwaies abhorred to make ſhew of ſuch baſe and vile humor, yet becauſe he could not well compaſſe all matters, nor ſettle his affaires, hauing ſo many enemies conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt him, and his eſtate being in a manner rent a ſunder and diſtracted, with ſo many great occaſions, his proud and haughty courage did not thinke any thing what ſoeuer to be either ſhameful or infamous, or to his diſhonor. Hereupon he cauſed one<note place="margin">Mahomet ſeeketh to haue truce with Scanderbeg.</note> of thoſe to be called before him, who was to cary the ranſome of their companions, and to him he opened the whole ſecrets of his conceipts: enioyning him expreſly to deale with the <hi>Saniacke</hi> in his name, and to will him to take vpon him the charge and managing of this matter, and to confer with <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> vpon the ſame. He ſent alſo particular letters vnto the <hi>Saniack</hi> (which afterwards came into the hands of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians) wherin he wrote vnto him: that in ſeeking the amity of the <hi>Albanois,</hi> and in the treating of the peace betweene them, he ſhould haue a ſpeciall care and good regard to the reputation and dignity of his Maieſty: for feare, leaſt if he ſhould ſhew himſelfe too affectionat or too humble in the purchaſing of the ſame, the enemy might grow too proud and inſolent, and fall to diſdaine both the demander &amp; his demands equally and alike. The meſſenger went on his iorney more glad and chearfull for this his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:13368:195"/>
then for the redemption of his owne perſon, and of his companions: for he was fully perſwaded, that now for a time this thorne would be drawen out of their feet, &amp; that the Turks being in reſt and quietnes on thoſe parts, ſhould a litle breath &amp; refreſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, from ſo many trauels which they had endured. But his expectation was fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat, &amp; <hi>Mahomet</hi> found himſelfe much deceiued of his hope: as at other times both he &amp; his father <hi>Amurath</hi> had bin the like. For when as <hi>Meſſeit</hi> (in counting of the money brought for their ranſome, did interpoſe and propound many ſpeeches vnto <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg</hi> according to the intent and inſtructions of his Lord &amp; maſter: the <hi>Albanois</hi> tooke the money very willingly, but as touching thoſe motions &amp; ouertures propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded for the peace betweene them, he ſhewed himſelfe ſo vnwilling, that cutting off his talke, he would not ſuffer him to proceed with his ſpeeches, but gaue him this aunſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I haue not (ſaid he) ſo often heretofore euen in the worſt &amp; hardeſt times of my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity,<note place="margin">Anſwer of Scanderbeg to Meſſeit refuſing to haue truce with Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.</note> refuſed the conditions of the peace which you then demaunded, to the intent I would now agree vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in my proſperity: neither hath this my good fortune (ſuch as it is) ſo depriued me of the knowledge of mans eſtate and fraile condition, or of the inſtability of humaine nature, that I do dare to promiſe vnto my ſelf, the continuall &amp; permanent poſſeſſion of the ſame: or that I do aſſure my ſelfe, that I will alwaies ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolently diſdaine your amity. It may well be, that Fortune may put on her falſe maske and viſage, &amp; may make vs in time petitioners vnto you for a peace perhaps far more ſhamefull &amp; ignominious. Notwithſtanding whatſoeuer it be that the ſecret originall and occaſion of matters, and the vnknowen order of the deſtinies, may bring vppon a man: yet are not we determined at this time in any point to alter our mindes, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract any thing from our former reſolution. We do repute al kind of amity with you moſt ſhamefull and ignominious, as long as we ſee ſo many outrages &amp; iniuries offred on all ſides vnto the Chriſtians: as long as we ſee ſo many wounds, and ſo much bloud lately and newly ſhed, wherewith both all <hi>Greece</hi> and the fieldes of <hi>Hungary</hi> are now ouerflowen. Shall we recompence the late loſſe of <hi>Morea</hi> with ſuch a peace? ſhall we with a moſt baſe and cowardly truce, ſhame and diſgrace that notable victory, and the late glory of the <hi>Hungarians</hi> before <hi>Belgrade?</hi> let <hi>Mahomet</hi> as long as he will ſeeke for peace, as for vs we will purchaſe our quietnes by the ſword: and hauing once gotten and attained it, we will by the ſword likewiſe ſeeke to maintaine it: and the rather for that it is not only your exceſsiue iniuries, or your notorious diſloialty, but a certaine naturall diſpoſition that hath made vs your enemies, &amp; the hatred (wherwith the one of vs is armed and hardened againſt the other) is perpetual and immortall. For my part I am your enemy, euen by birth &amp; by natiuity, and the enmity which I beare you is hereditary: my deſire is not ſo much to get me honor &amp; reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon you, as to ſeeke the iuſt deſerued reuenge of the bloud of my friends which you haue ſhed, and of the bondage both of my ſelfe and my people the <hi>Albanians:</hi> and I am fully reſolued, neuer to make an end of theſe my trauels, till ſuch time as I haue either reſtored my ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens to their auncient eſtate, or rendred this my life vnto you, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is ſo hatefull.</q>
            </p>
            <p>All this could not make the <hi>Saniacke</hi> to deſiſt from his purſuite: but putting him in mind, of the variable ſucces of wars, &amp; withall repeating vnto him many accidents of diuers ages and times paſt, as fit examples to that purpoſe and effect, he told him, that if he did take ſo great a pleaſure, &amp; were ſo deſirous of war: he might after the truce was once expired, returne to armes, and that he could neuer want occaſion to reuiue the wars: that he demanded only truce for ten yeares, during the which time the forces &amp; courages of the <hi>Albanians</hi> might be greatly repaired, and might be the better able to attaine to a more notable reuenge, and to purchaſe themſelues new honor &amp; reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> by litle and litle ſuffred himſelfe to be perſwaded, &amp; he began ſomwhat
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:13368:195"/>
to relent from his firſt obſtinacy, ſeeming to hearken more willingy to the demands of the <hi>Saniacke</hi> Neuertheles he would not in any caſe yeeld to any abſtinency of arms, not ſo much as for a moneth only: except that both <hi>Sfetigrade</hi> and <hi>Belgrade</hi> might be<note place="margin">Meiſſet Sani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acke and other Turkes priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ranſomed.</note> yeelded vnto him for a recompence. Thus without any thing concluded, did <hi>Meſſeit</hi> and his companions returne to their owne country: howbeit he had truce granted till ſuch time onely as he had acquainted the Turkiſh Monarch with the conditions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> in caſe the peace proceeded. There were many other Turkes permitted to depart in the company of the <hi>Saniacke</hi> (beſides thoſe 40. which were ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed:) vnto whom the king of <hi>Epire</hi> did freely, and of the magnanimity of his owne mind, grant their liberty, ſuffring them without ranſome to returne into their country: the reſt alſo which remained, were deliuered out of priſon: ſome of them becomming<note place="margin">Scanderbeg ſendeth preſents &amp; ambaſſades to moſt chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an princes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading them to concord and to take armes againſt the Turkes.</note> Chriſtians and being baptized, did plant themſelues to dwel in <hi>Epire:</hi> the reſidue were diperſed abroad for preſents in a maner to all the kings of chriſtendome: to the kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> beſides thoſe ſlaues was ſent a great quantity of horſes and other ſpoiles of all ſorts: and to other Princes were ſent other the like preſents. The citie of <hi>Rome</hi> as it had bin filled with the renowme of this victory, ſo was it repleniſhed with many of the trophees &amp; orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the ſame. Thus did <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> determine to the vttermoſt of his power to bind vnto him by his curteſie almoſt the whole world. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with theſe giftes and preſents did he ſend ſolemne ambaſſades, who had giuen them in charge to exhort all Princes Chriſtian to concord and amity, and earneſtly to pray them, that they would now at the length awake out of their long &amp; dead ſleepe, and that they would chaſe away that miſt of darknes wherewith they had bin ſo blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: and conſider more aduiſedly, the imminent ruine which was threatned to the Chriſtian liberty and religion: that they would at the laſt ſeeke to redeeme it from the miſerable and wretched yoke and ſeruitude of the Infidels &amp; <hi>Mahometans,</hi> otherwiſe they ſhould be well aſſured, that the plague which by litle and litle did grow within their bowels, would in the end pierce into their hearts. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> ſent alſo (which I may not omit) diuers preſents vnto his great friend <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> which were ſo magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent, that they caried the ſhew of a very beautifull and goodly triumph. <hi>Ameſe</hi> his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew was ſent alſo together with theſe preſentes vnto <hi>Naples,</hi> where he was kept in a moſt ſtraight and cloſe priſon, for the <hi>Sultan</hi> tooke no care for his deliuerance: and if he had made any ſuch motion, I doe aſſure my ſelfe, that all the golde of the world would not haue redeemed him, for he was condemned to perpetuall impriſonment.</p>
            <p>The mind &amp; laſt reſolution of the king of <hi>Epire,</hi> touching the treaty of the peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them being related vnto <hi>Mahomet:</hi> he eſteemed ſo ſlightly of the matter, that he would not vouchſafe him any aunſwere: ſuch was the haughtines and fiercenes of his minde, notwithſtanding, that he were hard preſſed on all ſides with infinite affaires of great importance, both from the partes of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and by daily diets and aſſemblies which he knew very well were continually gathered againſt him throghout all chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, by the procurement and earneſt meanes of the Popes holines. He prouided therefore a moſt ſtrong and puiſſant garriſon to be ſent into <hi>Epire,</hi> for the ſurety of his<note place="margin">Hamur and Synam ſent with two ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry garriſons to defend the Turkiſh fronti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers againſt the Albanois.</note> countrey, according to that which (as we lately told you) had bin before decreed in his priuat and ſecret councell. <hi>Hamur</hi> and <hi>Synam</hi> had the charge of this commiſsion, both of them being expert and polliticke warriours, and ech of them had 10000. horſe, and 4000. foote: which number was iudged to be ſufficient both to weary out the forces of <hi>Epire,</hi> and to haue terrified euen a moſt ſtout and puiſſant enemy: notwithſtanding ech of them was expreſly forbidden to attempt any thing againſt him, whatſoeuer oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion and oportunity were offered them, only he recommended vnto them, &amp; gaue them in charge to looke to the defence of thoſe limits which were aſsigned vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>The whole ſommer being ſpent in this maner, both on the one ſide &amp; the other, it
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:13368:196"/>
was now about the middeſt of Autumne: at which time theſe troups being diſlodged from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the report thereof preuented their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, &amp; was brought to the eares of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> who was ignorant of all this practiſe, for that he relied vppon the word of the <hi>Saniack,</hi> &amp; he did expect ſome anſwer from the <hi>Sultan,</hi> whether he would either accept or reiect the ſumme of his demaunds: for this cauſe departing from <hi>Croie</hi> with all ſpeed poſſible, he went preſently into <hi>Dibria,</hi> where hauing leauied new for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; renued his old companies, he attended the aduerſary with great deuotion, who ſtaid not long but that they came within 10. miles of the <hi>Albanois,</hi> where they encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped: but did not in any ſort enter vpon their confines. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> ſtirred not at all, but hearing that the Infidels approched, he preſently ordered his troups ready to the fight, &amp; ſo kept himſelf quiet within his camp. For the common bruit which ran vpon the comming of theſe forces, did giue them out to be ſo great &amp; puiſſant, that it made him<note place="margin">Hamur and Synam with their forces en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped neare Alchria in Macedony.</note> to imagine, that the enemy would come &amp; ſeeke him out in that ſame place, &amp; would not ſticke to aſſault him in his campe. And afterwards hauing notice by his eſpials and skouts, placed vpon the mountains, that they were encamped vnder <hi>Alchria,</hi> &amp; that al their cariage were diſpoſed in that place: he ſuppoſed that the morning next folowing after they had refreſhed their bands, they would make towardes him, and offer to giue him battel: wherefore in the darke of the night, and in great ſilence &amp; ſecreſie, he filled certaine woddy places, &amp; vallies neare adioyning with armed men, thinking to haue encloſed them in the middeſt of his forces, and ſo to haue ſurprized them, if they had come forward according as he expected. Two daies and 2. nights did he expect them in this maner: but he could neither haue a ſight of the enemy, nor yet heare any newes or tidings of them. Wherefore <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> being impatient of all delaies, determined the day following to go and viſit them, and to prouoke them forth to fight: but word was broght him, that the hoaſt of the Infidels being deuided into two parts, <hi>Hamur</hi> did abide ſtil at <hi>Alchria,</hi> &amp; that <hi>Sinam</hi> with the reſidue of the army, did take the champion plaine fields of <hi>Pologue</hi> towards <hi>Mocrea,</hi> where was the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> entry into the lower<note place="margin">Synam mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth with half the Turkiſh forces towardes Mocrea &amp; the lower Dibria.</note> 
               <hi>Dibria</hi> &amp; <hi>Modriſſa.</hi> For <hi>Alchria</hi> where <hi>Hamur</hi> did make his abode, was adioyning to the vpper <hi>Dibria</hi> &amp; to <hi>Sfetigrade.</hi> Thus with notable aduiſe, they lay cloſe vpon both the Prouinces of <hi>Dibria:</hi> to the intent they might hold the <hi>Albanians</hi> in continual ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rums, both on the one ſide &amp; the other. Betweene theſe two garriſons or armies, there was 30. miles at the leaſt: for ſo much is it from <hi>Modriſſa</hi> to <hi>Sfetigrade.</hi> Wherefore the king of <hi>Epire</hi> hauing drawn together his ambuſhments that lay here and there diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and hauing ioyned all his forces in one campe, determined to leauy a new ſupply for the ſtrengthning of his bandes, to the intent he might the more conueniently part them into ſeuerall quarters, &amp; ſo prouide for the preuenting of all perils on either ſide. All things being ſufficiently prepared, and his troups being quickly augmented with 1500. footmen, newly leauied (for it was not poſsible ſo ſodainely and readily to leauie horſmen) he deuided them as ſpeedily, though not into like and equall numbers: <hi>Tanu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe,</hi> and one of the <hi>Streezes Scanderbeg</hi> his nephewes, and <hi>Peic Manuell,</hi> with the third part of thoſe forces were appointed to haue the cuſtody of the lower <hi>Dibria:</hi> &amp; in caſe they found <hi>Synam</hi> any thing earneſtly enclined to the ſpoile of the countrey, that they ſhould make head againſt him, &amp; repreſſe his attempts: for on that ſide was the danger much leſſer, &amp; the entrance into the confines of the <hi>Albanians</hi> was the more difficult, by reaſon that the places were not ſo acceſsible, but (being naturally ſtrong and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced) were entermingled with the vallies of <hi>Mocrea,</hi> and with many rough and ragged mountaines, ech ſeuered &amp; deuided within themſelues, yet ſo entangled &amp; combined, that although they were reckonned and comprehended within the lower <hi>Dibria,</hi> did they diſtinguiſh neuertheles the realm of <hi>Albany</hi> from the territories of the miſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants. Notwithanding, both <hi>Tanuſe</hi> &amp; his company were ſtraightly charged, that they
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:13368:196"/>
ſhould not in any caſe ſcatter them ſelues, nor be drawen out of thoſe limittes which<note place="margin">Tanuſee with others appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the lower Dibria againſt Sinam</note> were preſcribed them, nor that they ſhould not in any ſort aduenture vppon the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but onely in the defence of their owne ſafety. The reſt of the army did <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> retaine to himſelfe in the vpper <hi>Dibria,</hi> hauing alſo <hi>Moſes</hi> in his company. Wherfore hauing thus reſerued the better part of his forces, and eſpecially his horſemen, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the paſſages there were more free &amp; open for the enemie to enter on that ſide into <hi>Albanie,</hi> he determined (if he could) to draw forth the Infidell to hazard the fortune of the field, and to aduenture the chance of a ſet battell. And he made no long<note place="margin">Scanderbeg marcheth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Hamur purpoſing to draw him to the fight.</note> delay, nor dwelt not vpon thoſe dumpiſh conceipts of his imaginations: but (becauſe winter approched, which is an enemy to warlike exploits) before the daylight of the next morning did appeare, he departed from his campe, hauing with him 1000. horſe, and tooke his way directly toward <hi>Alchria.</hi> Before his departure he very warily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed a good number of ſouldiers into certaine thicke woods and other daungerous places, for feare of being encloſed betweene <hi>Sfetigrade</hi> and the campe of the enemie. Hauing marched on for a while in the darke of the night, &amp; placed his men here and there in ambuſhments neare the towne, he went backe againe to his campe: and not reſting him ſelfe any thing at all (for that now it was about the dawning of the day) he commanded his companies to march, &amp; to carie with them victuals onely for one dayes prouiſion. As for the cariages and their tents, they were not at all remoued, but he left a ſtrong troupe of good ſoldiers for their ſafegard &amp; defence. The whole mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was in a maner ſpent in theſe preparations and in marching: ſo that he came at length within a mile of his ambuſcado. By that was it time to take their repaſts, and it behoued him to deuiſe vpon ſome new meane how to begin the fight, and to drawe forth the enemy. This was an eaſie matter for men that had bene long practiſed in that facultie, and yet neuertheleſſe it required great wiſdome and good aduiſe. <hi>Moſes</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to haue the honor of that employment, and it was not denied him: and in verie truth amongſt all the <hi>Albanians</hi> hardly could a man haue choſen any other more fit or expert to entiſe forth the enemy, &amp; to ſurpriſe him. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> gaue vnto him 600 horſe, doubting leaſt if he ſhould go more meanly accompanied, the policy might be the more eaſily diſcouered. But altogether in vaine was this his enterpriſe: for <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> hauing ſpent the greater part of the day in fruitleſſe skirmiſhes, returned againe to <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> whom he found at his wittes end, and not knowing what courſe to take againſt the enemy: for to ſet vpon the Painim within his trenches with his whole for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, both the diſcommodity of the place, &amp; the towne being aboue him, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ouer the place, vnder the ſuccor whereof, <hi>Hamur</hi> had entrenched himſelf, did certainly aſſure him that he could not do it without euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t danger. Nothwithſtanding hauing lead his forces to a hil neare adioyning, he ſtaid there vntill night, and then he made a ſigne to his ambuſhments, that they ſhould retire to the body of his army: the morning following he diſplaied his enſignes in the field, &amp; by light inuaſions, he wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted all the countrey on that ſide: thinking by the indignity of that miſerable ſight, to haue moued the enemy to make forth of his trenches, but the Pagan continuing in his wonted patience, &amp; diſdaining the defence of a thing of ſo ſmal value, &amp; which might be ſo perillous vnto him, kept himſelf ſtill within his campe: notwithſtanding I haue heard, that immediatly after the hauocke made by the <hi>Albanians,</hi> &amp; euen as they were<note place="margin">Meſſenger ſent from Hamur to Scanderbeg.</note> ready to truſſe vp their baggage, there came an Herald from <hi>Hamur</hi> to <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> to acquaint him with the intent and meaning of the <hi>Ottoman:</hi> and beſides to pray and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat him, that he would not weary both him ſelfe and his enemies with this <q>vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table kind of reuenge, by which he did deſtroy rather that which was his owne, then what was belonging vnto others: and conſidering that no man made any meanes, nor hadde any intent to hinder him, but that they did leaue all vnto him to vſe it at
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:13368:197"/>
his owne will &amp; pleaſure: whereupon the king of <hi>Albany</hi> is ſaid to haue returned him<note place="margin">Anſwer of Scanderbeg to the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur.</note> this anſwer: that well might they for a time delay and put off their misfortune, but they ſhould not be able altogether to auoyd it: for that he was reſolutely determined to ſpare for no dangers nor miſhaps,</q> but he would in the end bring and enforce them to the combat. In this maner did they depart a ſunder, for the coldneſſe of the winter now beginning to approch, it was thought requiſite that theſe determinations ſhould be deferred to another ſeaſon. Wherefore <hi>Moſes</hi> being appointed with his ordinary bands to haue the cuſtodie and defence of the prouince, and the moſt part of the army being licenced to depart, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> in the meane time with a ſmall company went to viſit the lower <hi>Dibria,</hi> which was then vnder the commaund of <hi>Tanuſee.</hi> There likewiſe did he not forget to put in practiſe the like ſleights and pollicies, in hope to haue entrapped <hi>Synam:</hi> but all his cunning and deuiſes vaniſhed away to nothing: wherefore leauing there one of the <hi>Streezes</hi> with a very ſmall company, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> him ſelfe tooke his iourney towards <hi>Croy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During this winter was <hi>Moſes</hi> very troubleſome vnto the <hi>Mahometiſts,</hi> &amp; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually diſquieted them with his daily alarums: notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding it was more in ſhew then in ſubſtance, and therfore <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> willed both him &amp; thoſe of the garriſon of <hi>Modriſſa</hi> to deſiſt from purſuing any ſuch further atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pts, for that they loſt both their time &amp; their labor. Moreouer it is reported, that thoſe of <hi>Mahomet</hi> his garriſon, as they had before in times paſt, ſo did they now againe vehemently pray the Chriſtians, that they would not with ſuch obſtinacy ſeeke to purchaſe vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues an enemy, who would not be drawn to haue any hoſtility with them: inſomuch that neither condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending nor according any thing to their deſire, nor yet much contradicting their requeſts, matters were protracted and drawen on till the comming of the new yeare. The ſpring being now come, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> reaſſembled his forces, and lead them againſt<note place="margin">1457.</note> the Barbarians, hoping by his daily skirmiſhes, to draw them forth to fight. One daie amongſt the reſt he had a deſire, being entred with great brauery vpon the country of <hi>Alchria,</hi> to force and giue an onſet vpon the campe of the enemy, but he was ſoone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed without any great labour, both by the liuely reſiſtance of the Infidels, as alſo by the ſituation &amp; aduantage of the place, which of it ſelfe was very ſtrong, and hardly to be approched. The <hi>Epirot,</hi> how beit for that time he was diſappointed of his hope, yet being no whit diſcoraged, determined to augment his troupes, that ſo he might be the better able to effect his deſire, but he made no great haſt to put it in execution, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the glory and profit would be very ſmall that would grow by that atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt, as alſo for that it could not be compaſſed without great perill and manifeſt danger: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he maintained the enterpriſe, onely to the intent that the ſouldier being kept ſtill exerciſed in armes (as it were in their particular trade and profeſsion) ſhould not waxe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And as touching that which he propounded vnto him concerning the league of peace with his Maiſter, he made him this anſwer, as it were in choler and diſcontentment.</p>
            <p>So ſuſpected (quoth he) is the faith, &amp; ſo captious and deceiptfull is the demeanour<note place="margin">Anſwer of Scanderbeg to the ſpeeches of Hamur perſwading him to peace.</note> 
               <q>of <hi>Mahomet</hi> towardes vs, that we can hardly digeſt and endure any ſpeeches of his friendſhip &amp; amitie. It is not long ſince that we had an Ambaſſade fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, by which we vnderſtood the ſumme of his demaunds: and we returned him againe with ſuch conditions as we thought meet and conuenient for the honor and profit of the eſtate of <hi>Albany:</hi> whereupon we expected his anſwer (for as touching other matters he was at libertie to follow his owne will and pleaſure:) but whileſt that we reſted in this expectation, and that the treatie remained in ſuſpence on either partie, and though we in the meane time had layed aſide our armes: yet did he ſo deſpiſe and contemne vs, that he thought vs vnworthy of any anſwer, which he ought not to haue done to his mortal enemy. Wherfore touching this motion of peace which thou haſt propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, we are not minded to heare any further ſpeeches: but as concerning thy ſelfe in particular, if there be any thing wherein we make any offers of curteſie to our enemy in the midſt of our common rancor and hoſtility, there ſhall be no default nor good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will wanting, ſo farre forth as thy deſerts ſhall require it. As touching the ſurceaſing from armes, and giuing ouer the ordinary rodes and excurſions of our ſouldiers, I can promiſe thee nothing, neither will I tye my ſelf to any thing: for I cannot be drawne to like of any appointment: but ſeeing that I my ſelfe haue bene ſo diſdained, as greatly do I diſdaine to grant it. And albeit our vehement and ardent deſire of reuenge, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of thy owne honeſt and good cariage, may be ſomewhat abated and mitigated, yet aſſure thy ſelfe, that our publike hatred and enmitie ſhalbe in no part diminiſhed.

<pb n="382" facs="tcp:13368:198"/>
loſſe of his deareſt and beſt friend. And to ſpeake the truth, this king was not vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be lamented with the long and continuall plaints and teares of the <hi>Epirots</hi> and other his confederates, but euen the whole world might well deplore his death. And how beit the cleare teſtimonie of his heroycall vertues hath bene publiſhed and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">The praiſe and commendation of Alphonſus king of Naples.</note> aduaunced by ſo many worthy and excellent perſonages, yet might it be imputed vnto me for a great fault &amp; ouerſight, if I ſhould not by the way (as it were) in a word or two touch it. It may well be ſayd: that when this Prince died, there departed the onely and beſt <hi>Mecaenas</hi> that then liued. For all degrees and qualities of perſons, both learned and martiall, as wel ſcholers as ſouldiers were left deſolate &amp; deſtitute of their beſt patron, and had iuſt cauſe to be ſad and ſorowfull for his loſſe. With him was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed the iuſt and true reward both of letters and of armes, and the true ornament of all commendable exerciſes. There was not his like ſeene for many ages before: nor (be it ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without the diſpleaſure of the poſterity) was there euer any one ſince him that was ſo vpright an eſtimator of the vertues and merits of other men. And it is no ſmall matter to be wondred at, that being a Prince of ſo rare &amp; incomparable curteſie, affabilitie, clemencie and liberalitie, yet no one Prince of his time did leaue ſo great riches and treaſures behind him. Good cauſe therfore had <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> to bewaile and lament the loſſe of ſo truſtie and puiſſant a friend: from whom (if we reſpect either his abilitie, or his willingneſſe) he might at all times and vpon all occaſions haue drawne any thing, both for his honor, and for his profit, as out of a plentifull treaſurie &amp; ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe prepared for his owne priuate and particular vſe. One thing onely there was, which did in ſome ſort comfort him, &amp; aſſwaged the bitterneſſe of his grief that was that he ſaw himſelf depriued ofſo good a frend, by the extremity &amp; courſe of his aged years, and not by any rigorous or iniurious right of nature, or by other caſualty. That pietie and dutie which reſted on his part to be performed in this behalf, he diſpatched it preſently with all prudence and celeritie, ſending away with all ſpeed his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours<note place="margin">Ambaſſidors ſent by Sca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg to Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d king of Naples vpon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Alphonſus</note> vnto <hi>Ferdinand</hi> his ſonne: both to deplore the accident of the king his father, as alſo to congratulate him (as the maner is) of his new crowne and dignitie: and by the remembrance of his fathers benefits, &amp; of the friendſhip and amitie which he bare to the eſtate of <hi>Albanie:</hi> to renew and increaſe this alliance and confederacy between them.

This Ambaſſade was receiued and entertained with great honor &amp; good cheare, ſuch as the tumult and ſtirres of that new kingdome would permit: for ſo it was in very truth, that all things were then in trouble &amp; diſorder: and the peace of all <hi>Italie</hi> was broken and diſturbed by the deceaſe of the late king <hi>Alphonſus.</hi>

that within a while after of a fatherly loue and tender affection, he gaue him both his life &amp; liberty, and reſtored him to his former eſtate &amp; dignities.

            <p>Sir, it hath pleaſed you only in reſpect of your own patience &amp; clemency without<note place="margin">Speech of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſa to Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg vpon his deliuerie out of priſon.</note> any particular merits or deſerts of mine, to haue a regard of my ſafetie, and to grant me my life: it is reaſon therfore that I alſo haue ſome care to the life and welfare of others: for feare leaſt if my ouer carefull deſire to maintaine my owne ſafety &amp; eſtate do make me to embrace your liberalitie, it may cauſe me to looſe them by your beneficence &amp; <q>bountie, which I haue heretofore too careleſly loſt by mine owne diſloyaltie. My poore and guiltleſſe wife is abiding with the <hi>Sultan,</hi> my tender infants and innocent children are there likewiſe: as yet are they ſafe and aliue, and ſo long will <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſuffer them to liue, as he ſhall thinke me to be your priſoner. But if the cruell tyrant ſhall once perceiue, that by giuing me my life &amp; libertie, you haue eſtranged me from him, and that I am retired to your obeiſſance, the rigorous and ſeuere creditor, will preſently either teare them in peeces, or will make ſale of thoſe gages of my faith and promiſe, and their innocent bloud ſhall beare the paine of their fathers fault. It beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth me therefore (if your Maieſtie thinke it good) that with ſome deuice I delude the <hi>Ottoman,</hi> to the intent that I may preſerue thoſe my pledges, and till ſuch time as I may finde ſome good oportunitie to free them for altogether. This night will I flie out of the towne, as though without your knowledge I had broken priſon, and ſo will I returne vnto <hi>Mahomet.</hi> There, partly by detracting and ſlaundering of their actions, and partly by hearing them detracted by others in the preſence of that credulous Prince (as I was wont to do when I was in fauour with him) I will bring him into a perſwaſion by my diſſimulation and faigning: that I am as much or more deuote to his ſeruice now at this preſent then I was at anytime heretofore: to the intent that all matter of miſtruſt being taken out of his mind (if he haue concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued any during the time of my impriſonment, and by reaſon of my long aboad with you, I may be the better able in the end to get away with all my family. It is in you much to further this my inuention, if you will make ſhew openly, that you are highly diſcontented at my flight, and doe impute the fault to them, vnto whoſe charge and cuſtody you had committed me. In the meane time, you may be fully aſſured, and I humbly beſeech and intreat you ſo to thinke of me, that during all that time which I ſhall be there expecting the houre of my eſcape, you ſhall haue me to be a faithfull eſpiall and intelligencer, to aduertiſe you of all things which the tyraunt ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult or determine vppon.

            <p>All things being conueyed &amp; accompliſhed according to the plot which they had layed: <hi>Ameſe</hi> by the meanes of his vncle, was ſoone ſhifted both out of priſon and our of <hi>Croy.</hi> The next morning his flight being publiſhed and ſpread abroad, the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of his keepers was reprooued with ſome ſharpe and hard words.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is moſt euident and apparant, that the changes and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which do occaſion the ruines &amp; grieuous accidents of Empires &amp; eſtates by ſeditions or warres either ciuill or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, do not happen in this world by any fatall kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny: eſpecially, if they be ſuch as they fall together in diuers and ſundry places, or neere about one and the ſametime. For we ſee that ſuch changes do neuer chance, but that firſt ſome frantique humors, &amp; inordinate deſires in the ſpirits of great perſonages do alwaies preceed &amp; go before them: and they are the ordinary meanes to ſtirre vp the authors of ſuch accidents to moue or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke needleſſe &amp; vnneceſſary wars.

vp their eies, that they doe inconſideratly caſt themſelues headlong into the gulfe of their owne perdition which they haue drawne vpon themſelues for want of good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe &amp; counſell. For the reaſonable part of their mind, and the naturall vnderſtanding being troubled and diſtracted by that inueglement &amp; blindnes laid vpon them, doth produce erronious counſels: and their mad and outragious affections do carrie and tranſport them out of the bounds of reaſon, and make them cruell &amp; vnſatiable, euen without any reſpect of their owne liues and welfare. Hence it is that rancours, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alities &amp; diſtruſts do proceede &amp; haue their originall: and then of theſe do ariſe wars both ciuill and forraigne, in the which men being drowned and ouerwhelmed, they find themſelues plagued and afflicted with notable miſchiefes and calamities, or with perpetuall ruine and endleſſe deſtruction.</p>

            <p>This new and gallant Conqueror <hi>Vſuncaſſan</hi> being puffed vp with the wind of his proſperous fortune, and with the forementioned croſſes and aduerſities of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> did ſend vnto him an ambaſſade with moſt rich and ſumptuous preſents, ſelected out of the huge treaſures of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> for a ſhew and oſtentation of the glorie of his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie, praying him that he would abſtaine from moleſting of <hi>Trapezond &amp; Cappado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi>

Iuly, that they might leaue and be abſent from the Court for a ſeaſon. Hereupon by ſeuerall wayes, they tooke their iourney &amp; met all together, firſt at <hi>Anagni,</hi> and from thence at <hi>Fondi,</hi> to the intent they might proceede in the election of a newe Pope, and this they did by the intelligence and practiſe of the Queene of <hi>Naples,</hi> who vnder hand had offered free libertie and ſecuritie within her dominions to conclude and go through with this election: her reaſon was, becauſe ſhe perceiuing her ſelfe not to be as yet thoroughly aſſured of the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> did deſire to haue a Frenchman made Pope, and ſuch a one as might be at her deuotion. In the end, when <hi>Vrban</hi> and they could not, or would not be brought to any good nor friendly accorde: they cauſed him to be cited to appeare at <hi>Fondi,</hi> and there they debated and handled the matter by certaine actes and proceedings in law, onely (in a manner) at the direction and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Maſter <hi>Nicholas</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> who at that time was a moſt famous Lawier, and<note place="margin">M.

By the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Marqueſſe, they of the plaine countrey being freed from the yoke, by his authoritie became all to ſtand for the <hi>Angeuin,</hi> and the townes likewiſe yeelded franckly vnto him. The Prince of <hi>Tarentum</hi> nowe perceiuing the good ſucceſſe and proſperitie that followed the <hi>Angeuin,</hi> beyond all credit and expectation, would no longer diſſemble his malicious and euill minde againſt <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> but made open warre againſt him with three thouſand horſe, vnder the charge and conduct of two Captaines, <hi>Vrſe Vrſin</hi> and <hi>Iulius de Aquauiue.</hi> Beſides all theſe great Princes and<note place="margin">Count Iames Picenin Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the army for Duke Iohn againſt Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand.</note> men of marke aboue mentioned, the Duke had drawen into his pay, the Count <hi>Iames Picenin,</hi> one of the moſt famous and politicke Captaines in that age: who comming to his ſeruice accompanied with a good number of men, of his old bands of mercenarie ſouldiers, was made Generall of all the power and forces of the Duke.

<pb n="405" facs="tcp:13368:210"/>
was fought betweene them a moſt fierce and blouddie battell: but once againe the Armie of the <hi>Arragonians</hi> being diſcomfited, the <hi>Angeuins</hi> obtayned a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<note place="margin">The ſecond vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie of the French againſt Ferdinand.</note> victorie, howbeit it coſt them full dearely. The report hereof being brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who was fled into <hi>Naples,</hi> beganne to make him muſe and imagine with him ſelfe what would followe, and he feared that ere long the towne would be beſieged. He left therefore the Queene to keepe <hi>Naples,</hi> and being not able of him ſelfe to make head againſt the armes both of his domeſticall and forraine foes, being ſpoyled of the moſt parte of his dominions: he put him ſelfe within <hi>Barie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bary or Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette.</note> with a verie ſmall and weake companie. The Count <hi>Picenin</hi> being enformed of his flight, left a ſtrong garriſon in <hi>Abruzze,</hi> for feare leaſt ſome newe enemie on<note place="margin">Ferdinand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged within Barie, by the Count Picenin.</note> that ſide, ſhould cut off the courſe of his attemptes: and with the reſt of his troupes he followed cloſe after the king euen to <hi>Barie.</hi> In the meane while Pope <hi>Pius</hi> and the <hi>Millanois</hi> made new prouiſions, and ſent them for the reliefe of <hi>Ferdinand:</hi> but the enemie hauing ſeized vpon all the paſſages, this leuie ſerued to no purpoſe, but onely for a vaine and fruitleſſe ſhewe.</p>
            <p>The Pope being in greater feare and perplexitie nowe then euer before, did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue well, that this matter would require forreine ſuccours, and that the valure<note place="margin">Confederates of Ferdinand ſent to Scanderbeg for ſuccours in the behalfe of Ferdinand.</note> and proweſſe of ſtraunge forces was to be vſed in this caſe. Whereupon all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates did thinke it beſt to ſend for <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> into <hi>Apulia,</hi> who being a Prince of great eſtimation and renowme in deedes of armes, was very ſeruiceable to the See of <hi>Rome:</hi> and withall was of late the moſt inward friend of <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> and no leſſe affectionate to <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> Beſides that, they conſidered that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> comming from the Sea, they could not hinder nor deny his landing in <hi>Apulia,</hi> but that he might open the paſſages towards <hi>Italie</hi> if neede were, ſo as the army and forces of the league might haue free liberty alſo to come on that ſide.</p>
            <p>I cannot in this place but greatly wonder, and in ſome ſort alſo it doth not a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle grieue me, to ſee the ingratitude of writers to thoſe perſons, whoſe valour hath ſo well and excellently deſerued. For whereas diuerſe of all ſortes haue written ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diligently, and recorded the ſumme of this warre betweene <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and the <hi>French:</hi> yet is there not any of them that hath ſpoken ſo much as one word of <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg,</hi> as though he had not beene (I may well ſpeake it) the principall and chiefe cauſe of the happy ſucceſſe of that warre: nay (if I may lawfully ſaie the truth) the true defendor of the Crowne of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and the deliuer of him out of the hands of his enemies. And hereof I neede giue you no other teſtimonie, then the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and bountifull recompence and reward giuen him by the King: for beſides that he acknowledged and held him for his father as long as he liued, he gaue him alſo in acknowledgement of his deſertes, and the rewardes of his vertue, the towne of <hi>Trana,</hi> and two other townes of as good reckoning in <hi>Aqulia,</hi> which the poſteritie of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> did continually enioy: after that the affaires of <hi>Epire</hi> (vpon the death of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi>) fell to decay and ruine, and they do in part alſo enioy them at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as may well be ſeene euen to this day.</p>
            <p>The Ambaſſadours of the league were no ſooner arriued in <hi>Epire,</hi> bringing with them letters from the Pope, the king <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Millan,</hi> but that<note place="margin">Ambaſſade fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Pope, Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand, &amp; the Duke of Millan to Scanderbeg.</note> 
               <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> was willing to giue them audience. Wherefore being brought vnto his preſence, they briefly recited vnto him, howe the king of <hi>Naples</hi> hauing loſt two great battels in the very heart of his realme, his Nobles and ſubiects, and the moſt part of his townes were reuolted from him: and himſelfe, being (as it were) baniſhed and exiled out of his countrey, was encloſed and ſhut vp with a tedious and troubleſome ſiege, in a towne ill fortified, ill prouided, and ſcarce defenſible, without the hope of
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:13368:210"/>
ſome preſent and ſpeedie ſuccours: wherefore if he had any remembrance and regard of the ſtrict friendſhip and amitie ſo faithfully held and obſerued betweene him and the king <hi>Alphonſus</hi> father of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> that then it would pleaſe him ſpeedily and without delay to paſſe with his forces into <hi>Apulia,</hi> to deliuer &amp; free him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the yoke and ſeruitude of ſtrangers, and not him onely, but all <hi>Italie,</hi> and (it might be) the holy ſiege of the See of <hi>Rome:</hi> whereunto they did all of them intreat and require him moſt earneſtly.</p>
            <p>There needed no great perſwaſions to the king of <hi>Albany</hi> to draw him on in this voyage: for beſides that he was moſt deuoutly affected to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the memory of his late and moſt inward amitie with king <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> did ſo farre preuaile with him, that ſetting aſide all the affaires of his owne kingdome, both publike and priuate, he franckly and voluntarily made him ſelfe a partie in the warre of <hi>Naples,</hi> and prouided preſently and out of hand for his embarkement and departure. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he left <hi>Epire,</hi> he found the way to aſſure himſelf of a truce with <hi>Mahomet:</hi> and<note place="margin">Truce between Scanderbeg &amp; Mahomet.</note> yet him ſelfe was not ſeene to motion or moue the matter, as though it proceeded of his ſeeking. Whereupon hauing ſet the affaires of his realme in good order, he ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Queene to be Regent of the kingdome, to whom he adioyned for aſſiſtaunts, ſome of the moſt worthie and chiefe perſons of the prouince, to counſell and aduiſe<note place="margin">Goic Streeſe ſent into Apu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia by Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg.</note> her in the gouernement of the Eſtate. Afterwardes he diſpatched away <hi>Goic</hi> his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, a Knight of great and ſufficient proweſſe, with a choiſe companie of fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred horſe towards the realme of <hi>Naples,</hi> willing him there to attend his comming: and in the meane while to keepe the enemie buſied by dayly roades and inuaſions vpon them.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being thus accompliſhed, after that the publike proceſſions, vowes, and prayers were ended for their good ſucceſſe and victorie, and for the preſeruation of him ſelfe and his people, he cauſed his armie to ſet forward, part of them to the gulfe of <hi>Rizic,</hi> where the <hi>Italian</hi> gallies did attend them: and part of them to the port of<note place="margin">Gulfe of Rizic. Duras, or Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rachium, Acroliſſa. Raguſa, or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidaure.</note> 
               <hi>Duras,</hi> and another part to <hi>Acroliſſa</hi> or <hi>Media</hi> and the reſidue of his forces him ſelfe conducted to <hi>Aſcriuia,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Raguſa,</hi> where his owne veſſels were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to receiue him. But before I paſſe any further, I will deſcribe vnto you (as well as I can) the towne and eſtate of <hi>Raguſa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which at this day men call <hi>Raguſa,</hi> was of old and in times paſt termed <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daure,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deſcription of Raguſa. Liburnia.</note> a citie (as ſome affirme) ſeated in <hi>Liburnia,</hi> vpon the Adriatique ſea, beautified with an excellent harbour, moſt fit and conuenient for ſhipping to ride and anker in, and defended with a great and ſtrong tower notably fortified and well furniſhed. The compaſſe thereof is more then a mile in circuit: her caſtell being inexpugnable, is on euery ſide enuironed with mountaines, and beſides excellently well fortified by art and handie worke of skilfull enginers. The towne was once abundantly ſtored with Churches and Temples, and richly beautified and adorned with goodly buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and with liuely ſprings and fountaines of water, which did continually flow into the towne by conduits &amp; ceſterns. The citie was wont to vſe the Ariſtocratical forme of ciuill gouernement, by the greateſt and chiefeſt perſons of the Eſtate, and they do attribute the firſt originall and foundation of their citie to the <hi>Epidaurians</hi> of <hi>Peloponneſa.</hi> The territorie thereof is not very large, but full of woods, and hath two litle townes or hamlets belonging vnto it.</p>
            <p>But let vs go on with the voyage of <hi>Scanderbeg:</hi> At his comming to <hi>Raguſa,</hi> all<note place="margin">Scanderbeg re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued at Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſa.</note> the people in generall went foorth to meete him, with exceeding ioy and incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable triumph: and conducting him into the towne, did receiue him with all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor that might be imagined. The next day after that the diuine ſeruice was ended,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:13368:211"/>
he went about the towne to take a view and ſuruey thereof: and the third day he viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the hauen, the arſenall, the fortreſſe, and the rampiers. The day following was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in diuerſe ſorts of ſhewes and pleaſant triumphs: and the fifth day he went to the Senate houſe, where were preſented vnto him many goodly and rich gifts: beſides that he was there receiued with an elegant Oration, containing a commendation of his great exploits and good deſerts: and pronounced with a ſingular good grace by<note place="margin">Dauid Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celor of Raguſa</note> 
               <hi>Dauid</hi> the Chancelour of that Common wealth. This Oration was anſwered by <hi>Paul Angell</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Duraz:</hi> who (as another <hi>Achates</hi>) was alwayes a companion<note place="margin">Paul Angell the Archbiſhop of Duraz.</note> to the Prince of <hi>Epire,</hi> and was a partaker with him in all his trauels, perils, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counſels. Theſe curteſies being paſt and ended both on the one part and the other, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> made ſtay at <hi>Raguſa</hi> onely ſo long, till that his whole fleete was there aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled: during which time of his abode, there was not pretermitted any kinde of ſports and triumphs, at tilt, turney, barriers, and ſuch like. In all which exerciſes the <hi>Albanians</hi> did ſhew themſelues to be very expert, as beſeemed good and worthie ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, till ſuch time as they were commaunded to prepare themſelues to go to ſea, for that the time did now require their departure. All things being prepared in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the king thought it beſt to cauſe all his veſſels to come together to <hi>Raguſa,</hi> and that all his troupes both horſe and foote, ſhould draw thither, to the intent they might take the benefite of the firſt winde to ſayle from thence into <hi>Apulia.</hi> For this cauſe he diſpatched away ſundry meſſengers along the ſea ſide, to wil all the ſhips, gallies, foiſts, and brigandines which had bene ſent from <hi>Italie</hi> for the cariage and tranſportation of his armie, to repaire all together to <hi>Raguſa:</hi> beſides all which, as many veſſels of his owne as were found vppon the coaſts of <hi>Epire</hi> and <hi>Macedonie,</hi> did arriue thither in great numbers: inſomuch that both the towne was too litle for the entertainment of ſo much people, and the port was too ſtraight for ſo great a fleet. All of them ſhewed themſelues ſo forward and willing to paſſe the ſea, that they ſeemed not as men that had bene led and drawne to the warres, but as if they had bene inuited to enioy the prize of an aſſured and vndoubted victorie: there were very few men left in <hi>Epire</hi> or <hi>Macedon</hi> that were fit &amp; able for the warres, but he had drawn them into that action. Yet is there great varietie &amp; diuerſitie of opinions touching the certainty of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that he tranſported to the realme of <hi>Naples:</hi> ſome affirme, that he had with him fiue thouſand foote, and fiue and twentie hundred horſe: others ſay, two thouſand foote, and three thouſand and fiue hundred horſe. Some name no certaine number at all (amongſt whom, the truth being ſo vncertaine, I meane to make one) and they ſay, that the multitude which embarked themſelues with him for <hi>Italie,</hi> was ſo great and incredible, that it ſeemed there were ſcant left behind any ſufficient or able men, either in <hi>Albanie, Sclauonie,</hi> or <hi>Macedonie,</hi> for the keeping of their houſes and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate dwellings.</p>
            <p>Nowe to the intent his armie might be embarked and put aboord without diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and confuſion, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> tooke the care of that matter to himſelf, and he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Guirize de Vladienne</hi> to be Comiſſarie of the victuals: who made prouiſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of<note place="margin">Guirize de Vladienne.</note> for fifteene dayes, (of the which ſtore they had for fiue dayes readie dreſſed.) Euery man being gotten on ſhip boord, he ſent certaine skiffes throughout all the fleete, to giue them aduertiſement, that the Patrons and two ſouldiers of each ſhip ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire vnto him vpon the ſhore to vnderſtand his will and pleaſure: who being come he demaunded of them, whether they had freſh water and bisket aboord for as many dayes as they had victuals: and anſwer being made, that they had prouiſion of all things for fifteene dayes: he then enioyned and gaue ſpeciall charge to the ſouldiers, that they ſhould hold them ſelues ſtill and quiet, and be in a readineſſe to helpe the
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:13368:211"/>
Pylots and Marriners if neede were, and that euery man ſhould attend his charge and office without any noiſe or altercation amongſt them. Himſelfe and <hi>Gine Muſache</hi> made the right wing with fiue Galleaſſes: <hi>Andrewe, Zacharie,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> had the commaund and charge of the left wing, in which were the ſame number of the like veſſels both ſeruing for the ſafegard and defence of their ſhippes of charge. He or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained<note place="margin">Scanderbeg em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>barketh him ſelfe for Italy.</note> that euerie Galleaſſe ſhould haue one lanterne, and that thoſe of charge ſhould haue two: and that the Admirall or chiefe Galleaſſe ſhould haue three lights or lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes. Theſe rules and orders being ſet downe and pronounced, the next day he gaue them the ſignall to weigh anker, and to make out of the hauen to ſeaward, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelfe and his nauie to the guide and protection of the diuine power. Many of his veſſels were launched forth &amp; put out to ſea from the gulfe of <hi>Rizic,</hi> from the port of <hi>Duraz,</hi> from <hi>Valona,</hi> and from the coaſt of <hi>Epyre</hi> and of <hi>Sclauony:</hi> and many of them alſo were gone before and had taken their courſe all alone. Aſſoone as the day began to breake, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> being abord the Admirall, and hauing commanded a generall ſilence by ſound of trumpet, with a high voice began to pray in this manner.</p>

Neuertheleſſe holding on their courſe, they made ſaile till it drew towards night. By this time they beganne to diſcouer a little Iſle, and the Pylot demaunded of the King, whether he ſhould direct his courſe thither or not: for they might eaſily perceiue that there was a tempeſt comming, and the waues of the ſea beganne to ſwell, for it was in Autumne.) <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> hauing willed him to bend his courſe to the Iſle: the whole fleete did come to harbour within the port, where hauing caſt ankers, they rode there for eight dayes together, by reaſon of the outrage and ſwelling of the ſea, which being at length growen calme, and the winde ceaſed, early in the morning by the riſing of the Sunne, hauing heard diuine ſeruice, they put againe to ſea, and made ſaile all that day and the night following, ſo that the next morning by breake of day, they came within ſight of the coaſt of <hi>Apulia.

This is nowe our caſe (my good ſouldiers) and our eſtate and condition is not much vnlike: we are now ouer the ſea, farre from our owne houſes, from our owne countrie, vppon the territories and dominions of our enemies, amongeſt ſtrangers, altogether deſtitute and voide of hope, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any meanes to returne againe to our owne: yea our affaires are brought to that paſſe, that it is impoſſible for vs to reſolue, whether is better for vs to ſtande ſtill or to goe forwarde, conſidering that beſides our armes, our horſes, and our courages (wholly bent and addicted to deedes of armes) we haue nothing elſe left vs to relie and build vpon: for there is now no hope of life nor ſafety, if we get not ſome notable victorie vpon our enemies. But courage, (my maſters) let vs conſider, that this is the diuine will and pleaſure, that we ſhould maintaine the patrimony of Ieſus Chriſt, the houſe of God, and the ſeat of his Church: and doubt you not, but that he will ſend vs euen from heauen an eaſie and a ſpeedie victorie, vnder whoſe name and protection we being now to fight: ſoone ſhall we confound this our enemie, and then ſhall we returne into our countrie conquerours, ioyous, and triumphant. Hereof I make no doubt nor queſtion, when (firſt of all) I call to remembrance your ordinary and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted valure, when I ſet before my eyes ſo many goodly victories which you haue gotten vppon your enemies: and then being thus confirmed through the confidence of your vertue and prowes, I haue cheerefully vndertaken this preſent voyage, as hauing learned by your armes to breake and diſcomfite greater armies, and farre better then this that is now oppoſed againſt vs. Much more reaſon haue you (my companions) not to eſteeme of theſe ſmall troupes, which (as you haue alreadie ſeene) at the onely brute and hearing of our names, and before that euer they had anie ſight of vs, did (as a man may ſay) betake themſelues to flight, and durſt not tarrie our landing, but remoued their ſiege, and are retyred from vs. It remaineth therefore that we purſue them whileſt they are in this feare and aſtoniſhment: but yet in this would I haue you to be aduiſed (my good friendes,) that if it happen this our enemie ſhould dare to abide vs, and to come to fight with vs (which I doe not beleeue) my counſell is, that at the firſt we onely holde him play by looſe and light skirmiſhes, and that we doe endeuour to wearie and ouercome him with the trauell and trouble of continuall onſets and often charges: in ſo doing eyther ſhall we put them to the ſworde, or get them aliue to be our priſoners. For the weight and heauineſſe of their owne armes doeth ſufficiently plague and afflicte them in the fight: and theſe barded horſes, are neyther ſo readie to purſue, not yet ſo nymble to flie from vs: but that we being lightly armed and mounted, haue great aduauntage againſt them, being able by courſing vppe and downe, both to annoy and to diſorder them with eaſe. Goe to then (my braue and couragious ſouldiers) let euerie man ſee that his horſe and armour be in a good readineſſe: for by the

            <p>The <hi>Albanois</hi> (who deſired nothing more then to ſee the enemie) being more and more enflamed with theſe ſpeeches, the next morning by the breake of day preſented themſelues readie and reſolute to march againſt the enemie: and hauing ſerued God, they tooke the fielde with Enſignes diſplayed with a full intent to goe ſeeke out the<note place="margin">Scanderbeg his troupes in skirmiſh with the French.</note> French: with whom when they came to encounter, they did not ioyne with them with the whole bodie of their forces in plaine and ſet battell, but they did onely taſte them with a light conflict: for that the intention of the Albanian Prince was not as yet to make a full tryall of his fortune, but onely to ſport a little with the enemie, and to proue what manner of ſouldiers they were, and how they could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meane themſelues with their armes on their backes. In this skirmiſh there lay dead vpon the place thirtie of the French partie, and twentie taken priſoners: of the <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois</hi> not any one eyther ſlaine or taken, only foure of them were wounded, and they returned all of them with great ioy to <hi>Bari.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day following was a Councell called of the Maſters of the Campe, and the other Chiefetaines of the armie, to the which the King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ledde <hi>Scanderbeg:</hi> there was it propounded, that eyther they muſt aduenture the battell, or march into <hi>Abruzza,</hi> to open the paſſages for the troupes of the confederates,<note place="margin">Ferdinand and Scanderbeg free the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Abruz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za.</note> and ſo being conioyned with them, to goe and encounter with the enemie. The concluſion was, that they ſhould take the way to <hi>Abruzza,</hi> and thereupon was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der giuen to all the ſouldiers both thoſe of the King and the <hi>Albanois</hi> that they ſhould be in a readin eſſe, and that euerie man ſhould furniſh himſelfe with victuals readie dreſt for fiue dayes. This done, and the towne being aſſured with a good garriſon, the armie beganne to march, both the King and <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> being preſent: and they paſſed on cloſe and in good order, with great ſilence and ſecreſie, the darkenes of the night fauouring them, in ſuch ſort that they were not diſcryed by the French campe, which lay not far off: &amp; ſo held on their courſe directly towards the country of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruzza,</hi> where being arriued, and comming ſuddenly vpon thoſe that kept and garded the paſſages, they charged vpon them vnprouided ſo furiouſly both behinde and in flanke, and on all ſides, that hauing diſperſed and ſcattered them for the moſt part, or<note place="margin">Ferdinand and Scanderbeg. ioyne with the forces of the league.</note> hauing taken or cut them in peeces: the wayes and paſſages were made open and free to the companies of the league, which were vnder the conduct and commaund of <hi>Frederick</hi> Duke of <hi>Vrbin</hi> and <hi>Alexander Sforce:</hi> who being vnited and incorporated one with the other army, they went and encamped nere to <hi>Vrſara</hi> a towne that ſtood for King <hi>Ferdinand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now being ſo farre remoued from <hi>Bari,</hi> and conſidering that they had to deale with one the moſt ſubtle and politique warriour, and the moſt able and expert ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier liuing: namely <hi>Pycenin,</hi> who (as they thought) might eyther ſollicite that place to reuolt: or vpon the feare of their abſence, and by the trauerſes of vnconſtant fortune if they ſhould preſent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues before the towne, they might happen with eaſe to cary and obtaine it: it was therefore thought conuenient to ſend thither ſome good and ſufficient Chiefetaine with good and ſtrong forces, both to ſecure the towne (if need were) and to preuent the enemy of any ſuch enterpriſe, and the ſame being once done and diſpatched, to returne againe, and to ioyne with them in one campe. This commiſſion was of ſufficient difficultie, and there was none that did enuie it vnto <hi>Scanderbeg:</hi> and therefore he offering himſelfe, and requeſting to haue the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that ſeruice, it was liberally and freely accorded vnto him. He had a good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion and great deſire to ſee the French once againe, and to ſpeake with <hi>Pycenin</hi> neerer and more at hande. Being arriued at <hi>Barie</hi> with his owne bandes, he found
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:13368:213"/>
all things there as he deſired, wherefore hauing taken order for all accidentes, he diſlodged thence as ſpeedily, and marched directly towardes the French campe. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly vpon his approach, he ſent them a defiance, and challenged them to the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell: they who had vſed alwaies to vanquiſh and carrie away the victorie, made no<note place="margin">Fight betweene Scanderbeg &amp; the French.</note> long delay, but were as forwarde to meete him. Ech partie therefore tooke the fielde in good order and well reſolued: the <hi>Albanois</hi> had deuided his armie into three partes: <hi>Moſes</hi> of <hi>Dibria</hi> led one of his battallions, of the ſecond <hi>Guirize</hi> had the commaund, and the thirde he reſerued to himſelfe, hauing an intent therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to affront <hi>Pycenin.</hi> Thus all things being orderly diſpoſed for the fight: hee made towardes the enemie by three ſeuerall wayes at once. The whole day was ſpent almoſt in skirmiſhes and light conflictes: for the <hi>Albanois</hi> making ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as though they fledde and feigned themſelues to be affraide: ſometimes by wheeling and caſting ſuddainely about, then againe by often and ſudden charge and retraites: courſing vppe and downe the breadth of the plaine, did ſo wearie and moleſt the French, that in the ende, the battell fell out as him ſelfe expected. Manie were ſlaine outright, and many of the Dukes ſide were taken priſoners, onely one of the <hi>Albanois</hi> was ſlaine, manie hurt and verie fewe taken. But the Count being quicke conceipted and politique, and wiſely foreſeeing that by this newe kinde of fighting: if <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> with his ſouldiers ſo well exerciſed by long practiſe, vſe, and diſcipline, did not put him to the worſt, yet he was like enough to giue him his handes full: he bethought him ſelfe therefore, that if he could get to ſpeake vnto him, he might peraduenture obtaine ſome ſtaie, and ſo cauſe him<note place="margin">Policie of Count Pycenin</note> to ſurceaſe from fighting. For this cauſe he aduaunced him ſelfe alone at the head of his ſquadrons, and with a huge voyce called <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> by his name, inuiting and requeſting him to come to a parley with him. The <hi>Albanois</hi> being of a courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and generous diſpoſition, and without anie apprehenſion of feare: knowing that it was the Countie, did not diſdaine to ſpeake with him, but put himſelfe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the head of his troupes. The two Chiefetaines beeing thus ſeparated from their companies, made choice of a place equally diſtant from the two ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and diſcouered rounde about on all ſides to be free from all ſuſpition of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ambuſhmentes, and there both they mette to conferre and parley together. The Count greatly maruelling at the preſence of the King of <hi>Epyre,</hi> ſtoode ſtill without any word ſpoken attentiuely beholding him from the head to the foote. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> was the firſt that diſmounted from his horſe, and approaching to the Count, he tooke him about the bodie (for he was a man of a verie litle ſtature) and lifted him vp aloft from the ground, and afterwards hauing kiſſed him (as his cuſtome was) he let him downe againe very eaſily. The Count to colour his ſubtiltie, feigned that he had<note place="margin">Count Pycenin his notable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation.</note> great matters to entreat of with him, and which could not be expreſſed in a ſhort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. For he promiſed ſo to contriue all things, that either the Frenchmen, leauing the quiet and peaceable poſſeſſion of the Realme of <hi>Naples</hi> to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide<note place="margin">Pycenin his parley with Scanderbeg.</note> out of <hi>Apulia,</hi> and ſo returne ouer the mountaines: or if not, that he would worke their confuſion. And ſo proceeding in a moſt friendly and louing diſcourſe: he ſaide, that he was fully aſſured, that if the Frenchmen (who were naturally proud and inſolent, and did beare a deadly and mortall hatred to the <hi>Italians</hi>) ſhould once get ſure footing in the Realme of <hi>Naples:</hi> they would not reſt contented with that portion, but they would aſpire to the Dominion of all <hi>Italy,</hi> the inhabitants whereof they reſpected not nor regarded no more then as ſlaues, and as brute beaſts &amp; vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creatures. All this and many things elſe, did he promiſe to doe, both for the benefit and greatneſſe of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> as alſo for the reputation &amp; immortall renowme
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:13368:214"/>
of <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi> And to this ende he requeſted him, that he would cauſe his people to ſound a retrait, as he was readie for his part to do the like: that the ſouldiers of both ſides might take breath, and might refreſh themſelues from their labours and trauels which they had endured all the day long: affirming that this was a vſe and cuſtome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer obſerued in warres amongeſt the <hi>Italians:</hi> and for that it was now growing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes night, and the ſouldiers on both ſides being faint and wearie, he held it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, that the two armies ſhould retire into their tentes, and that euery man might betake himſelfe to his reſt. He alſo entreated him of all courteſie, that he would meete him the next morning with a ſmall company (to the intent Duke <hi>Iohn</hi> &amp; the French men might doubt and ſuſpect nothing) in ſuch a place as he would aſſigne, that they might there conferre more at full vpon theſe matters. This fraudulent plot did <hi>Pyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nin</hi> conuey with ſingular diſſimulation equall to his malice and deſpightfull humor.<note place="margin">Count Pycenin his diſhoneſt practiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg.</note> For his drift was to bring the <hi>Albanois</hi> within his daunger either aliue or dead (an act moſt diſhoneſt, and litle practiſed amongſt true Knights) or at the leaſt wiſe he thought by drawing out the parley at length to gaine time, and to bring it to paſſe, that the night ſhould ſeparate them: for he perceiued full well, that the <hi>Albanois</hi> had the aduantage of that dayes iourney. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> giuing faith and credite to his ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, by reaſon he was a perſonage of great renowme and authoritie, did ſimply and plainely condiſcende to his requeſt, cauſing to ſound a retrait and to ceaſe the combat. In this meane time <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Guirize</hi> (who in the late skirmiſh had taken priſoners foure ſquadrons of the enemies) did preſent them vnto their Generall: which <hi>Picenin</hi> ſeeing, he beganne to bluſh for ſhame, and being ſore troubled in his mind, he ſtood a while as if he had bene dombe: afterwards being come to himſelfe, he ſpake againe to the Prince of <hi>Albanie</hi> according to his wonted diſſembled manner to this effect.</p>

For (as thou ſeeſt) after we had ſet downe an order and publiſhed it with one voice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that the ſouldiers of both the armies ſhould withdrawe themſelues from the battell: theſe men notwithſtanding haue aſſailed and forced theſe my ſquadrons, who were obedient to our edict, and they haue now brought them hither priſoners vnto thee to our great reproach and diſhonor, a thing in my iudgement vniuſt and iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and contrarie to thy faith and reputation. Neuertheleſſe truſting in thy vertue and valure, for that I haue euer reputed thee to be a Prince of great magnanimitie and faithfull of thy word, I haue good hope that thou wilt obſerue the faith and promiſe which thou haſt giuen me, and wilt cauſe theſe ſouldiers to be ſet at libertie, as being vniuſtly taken and made priſoners.</q> But the Count went not away without an aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere: for <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> replyed vnto him in this manner.</p>

For, to ſay that our Captains and men at armes haue taken or defeated thy ſquadrons when they were diſarmed, or after that publication of our edict and agreement: thou thy ſelfe haſt ſeene the contrarie, and thou maieſt not denie it, but that at the verie firſt that wee two met together in this place, my men had both foyled and taken thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners before that euer there was any abſtinence of armes either concluded or ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied throughout our armies: and therefore I know not how it ſhould be that this matter ſhould ſeeme ſo ſtrange and iniurious vnto thee: for if our troupes (as thy ſelfe haſt confeſſed) haue bene in fight all the day long: is it poſſible that our agreement

ſhould in ſo ſhort a ſpace be publiſhed and made knowen throughout all the quarters of our campe? and can it be that thy men ſeeing my forces ſtill in armes and in fight, could ſo ſimply layedowne their armes and giue ouer fighting? then muſt I needes thinke that whileſt thy ſouldiours would ſhew themſelues (as thou ſayeſt) preciſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruers of thy commaundements: they are iuſtly and to their ſhame made priſoners vnto vs: or rather in deſpight of their willes being ouercome by right of armes, they haue loſt the victorie and haue deſerued this captiuitie. Moreouer how canneſt thou call or account my men either rebellious or careleſſe of diſcipline, with whom many times in fewer &amp; leſſer numbers (be it ſpoken without boaſting) I haue broken and ouerthrowen ſo many puiſſant and mightie armies of the Barbarians? with whom I haue tamed, ſubdued, and made captiues ſo many proud and braue Chieftaines of the Turkes and Infidels? and if I ſhould ſpeake the truth of their obedience, and their order in militarie diſcipline: I dare auow that they feare and reuerence me more as their Leader and Generall, then they doe ſtand in feare of you being their enemies. And as concerning that requeſt of thine, that theſe thy ſquadrons (being by right of warre made my priſoners) ſhould be freely reſtored and redeliuered vnto thee: truly thy demaund ſhall not be in vaine: for thoſe whom the furie of the fight hath ſpared aliue, it is not my vſe nor cuſtome to depriue them either of life or libertie.</q>

            <p>Now the number of them which were ſo taken, were about 100, all which <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi> deliuered with their armour and gaue them freely vnto <hi>Pycenin:</hi> who after that this parley was ended, betooke himſelfe to his campe, and the <hi>Albanois</hi> went towards <hi>Bari,</hi> from whence the next morning very early, being accompanied onely with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen horſemen and no more, he went backe againe to meete with <hi>Pycenin</hi> according to the promiſe and agreement concluded betweene them the day before. As he was ryding on his way, there preſented himſelf vnto him one that came from the enemies campe, ſent (it may be) by <hi>Zachary Groppe,</hi> who (as ſome write) was then in the pay of the French: or elſe ſome one of them who had lately proued the bountie and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie<note place="margin">Zachary Grop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe in paye with the French in Italie.</note> of the Prince, holding it an vnworthy and diſhonorable part, that the Count a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the lawes of armes and honorable warres, ſhould vſeſuch falſhood &amp; diſloialty towardes <hi>Scanderbeg:</hi> but howſoeuer it was, ſeeing in ſo great want and obſcuritie of writers, we cannot learne nor yet coniecture any otherwiſe of the caſe: let it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that this ſouldier did diſcouer and make knowen vnto <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> this practiſe of<note place="margin">Count Picenin his practiſe diſcouered to Scanderbeg.</note> the County: giuing him to vnderſtand, that the long parley of the day laſt paſt, was nothing but an illuſion both to draw his owne armie out of the danger of that daies iourney, as alſo to entrap him and to bring him within his danger: telling him alſo, that the place appointed for their meeting was full of ambuſhments purpoſely diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and prepared to that effect: and he willed him in any caſe not to paſſe any farther, for if he did, he ſhould be either ſlaine or taken. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> to proue the truth of this matter, ſent forth certaine horſemen to diſcouer the countrie, and they found it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly as it had bene reported. The guile and fraud of the Count being reuealed and made manifeſt, the Prince of <hi>Epire</hi> began to reproach him in his abſence with the note of plaine treaſon and infidelitie: and he obiected vnto him a thouſand villanies,<note place="margin">Scanderbeg challengeth Count Picenin to the battell.</note> calling him periured and diſloiall: and he ſent vnto him preſently a defiance, willing him to prepare himſelfe to the battell againſt the next morning. But <hi>Picenin</hi> without returning any anſwer, about the firſt watch of the night following, truſſing vp his baggage together with Duke <hi>Iohn</hi> and his french forces, made a long march the ſame night and retired himſelfe at laſt to <hi>Nocera,</hi> doubting leaſt that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> would<note place="margin">Picenin &amp; the French ſecretly diſlodge to Nocera.</note> haue inuaded him before day: for he had heard that the <hi>Albanois</hi> did often and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly vſe to take the aduantage of the night, for the execution of his moſt notable
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:13368:215"/>
and greateſt exploits. The day following early in the morning, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> with his armie in good order and with full reſolution to fight, tooke the field: but there was none to be found that would come againſt him, by meanes whereof his expectation being fruſtrate, he was greatly diſcontented and aggrieued that he had loſt the opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie to reuenge himſelfe: and he referred it to ſome other time. He returned ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Scanderbeg ioyneth with Ferdinand.</note> towardes <hi>Bari,</hi> where hauing taken order and ſeene all things ſafe and ſure, he tooke his way to <hi>Vrſara</hi> where <hi>Ferdinand</hi> with his <hi>Italian</hi> forces did then lye en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped.</p>
            <p>

Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing therefore to begin, with the recitall of your firſt deſerts, I will onely glaunce at ſome of your valiant and worthie exploites. Are not you the men that more then once haue broken and put to flight the armies of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> in open and ſet battell: and reducing them to the extreamitie of a ſhamefull ſiege, firſt within <hi>Naples,</hi> and afterwards within <hi>Bari?</hi> Are not you thoſe braue warriors which once or twice haue ſcattered and cut in pieces the forces of the Pope, and of the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> which came to the aide and ſuccour of the <hi>Catalan?</hi> what reſteth then (my good ſouldiers,) but that you purchaſe vnto your ſelues, the Empire not onely of <hi>Apulia</hi> and <hi>Calabria,</hi> but euen of all <hi>Italie?</hi> Who ſhall ſay you nay? who ſhall be able to oppoſe himſelfe againſt you?

               <q>And you (ô valiant and thrice fortunate Frenchmen, the terror and feare of all <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie</hi> and of all the world:) where are now the <hi>Romanes,</hi> who once triumphed ouer the whole earth? ſo often ouercome and diſcomfited by your braue valour in plaine fight and ſet battell? where is <hi>Rome</hi> the capitall citie and Empreſſe of the world? hath ſhe not bene made the prey and ſubiect of your furie? All eſtates Chriſtian ſtand in doubt &amp; feare of you: the Infidels the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> and in briefe all the Barbarians, and all peoples and nations doe feare and reuerence you, flying at the onely bruite and report of your name. You are the true warriours; to you it is giuen by the Fates and diuine Deſtinies: to you valiancie hath the heauen promiſed the ſoueraigntie, not onely of <hi>Apulia</hi> and <hi>Sicilia,</hi> but euen of the whole world.

This is the time (my friendes) that we muſt bring this warre to a glorious and happie end, that we may purchaſe vnto our ſelues the quiet and peaceable poſſeſſion of theſe goodly townes, this rich champion, and this frute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full countrie.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There is no doubt but the Count <hi>Pycenin</hi> was a moſt worthie and vigilant Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, yet did he not riſe timely enough that day to preuent the induſtrie &amp; diligence of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> who was alreadie ſeized and poſſeſſed of the mountaine when the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thought to haue gone and taken it. Whereupon growing very ſad and in a manner confounded, from that time forward he was out of all hope of victorie, and (as ſome ſay) he adiudged the fortune of the field vnto <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi> Notwithſtanding as that Pylot or Marriner is nothing worth, which is not able at all times, but onely in faire and calme weather, to guide and gouerne the ſhip, and to ſtand to the helme: ſo <hi>Pycenin,</hi> to ſhewe that he knewe how to vſe all fortunes both good and bad, put in execution and triall at this time all his skill and experience which he had gotten and learned by the continuall practiſe and exerciſe of armes, in ordering and diſpoſing his ſquadrons againſt the battell following according to a moſt exact and perfect or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And firſt of all he helde it not amiſſe once againe to encourage his companies,<note place="margin">Count Picenin encourageth his ſouldiers.</note> ſhewing them, that they had no reaſon to deſpaire of the victorie, the euents of warre being more vncertaine, then in any other humaine action whatſoeuer: and that only <q>vertue and valure which was careleſſe and prodigall of life, was that which made men to be immortall.</q> This did he ſpeake vnto his ſouldiers, becauſe he was reſolued, to aduenture the hazard of a generall battell with all his companies vnited and in one both <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Frenchmen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two Generals both on the one ſide and the other, did not omit by all meanes and perſwaſions poſſible, to enflame and ſet on fire the hearts of their ſouldiers, in ſo much that ech of them ſpeaking vnto them with a loud &amp; high voice did vrge them with theſe &amp; the like conſiderations: That euerie man ſhould prepare himſelfe both <q>with his armes and in courage to the laſt combat and tryall of their vertue and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: and that they ſhould now ſtriue to vanquiſh not for a day but for euer: that they ſhould ſee the next day before night, this quarrell decided and concluded betweene Duke <hi>Iohn</hi> and king <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> whether of them twaine ſhould be Maiſter of the fielde, and giue the law to the <hi>Neapolitanes:</hi> that the realme of <hi>Apulia</hi> and <hi>Calabria</hi> ſhould be the prize and reward of them that were victorious: that the perill was no leſſe then the recompence of them whom fortune had determined to frowne vppon and to diſfauour: for that neither the <hi>Albanois</hi> nor the <hi>French</hi> (if they ſhould happen to flie and to haue the worſt) had no place of refuge in a ſtrange and vnknown land.</q> Thus thoſe two Noble and generous Princes, thoſe two excellent and famous chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and thoſe two armies of rare and vndoubted prowes, did prepare and make ready themſelues to the hazard and aduenture of the battell, and preferred themſelues ech in view and ſight of other, in hope either to augment and increaſe their forepaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed honour and reputation, or elſe vtterly to make an end thereof, and to extinguiſh it for euer. Their mindes were diſtracted with doubtfull hope and feare, ſometimes regarding their owne troups, and ſometimes thoſe of the contrarie partie: and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to conſider of their forces rather by the eye then by their reaſon: they did deuiſe vnto themſelues all at one inſtant, ſomtimes matter of ſorrow and griefe, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of ioye and gladneſſe. That which of themſelues they did not remember: the
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:13368:216"/>
exhortations and briefe admoniſhments of their Generals did ſupply: a matter need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full amongeſt ſo many nations differing and diſagreeing in manners, in language, in lawes, armes, habit, and humours. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> put his men in minde of their eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeares warres, of his noble exploites and deedes of armes in <hi>Aſia,</hi> in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonie,</hi> in <hi>Thrace,</hi> in <hi>Epyre,</hi> of ſo many Chiefetaines and numbers of Turkes and circumciſed Miſcreants ſlaine by them, and of ſo many armies of the <hi>Mahometistes</hi> which they had ouercome and defeated: and if by chaunce he came to make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of anie one of his combats, he forgot not the notable deſertes and particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of ech man in ſeuerall. The Count <hi>Iames</hi> fell to recount likewiſe his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous actes, and the late battelles which he had foughten to his great honour and commendation both in the Marqueſdome of <hi>Ancona,</hi> in <hi>Apulia,</hi> in <hi>Naples,</hi> and in other parts of <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> deuiding his foote forces onely into two battallions, placed in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front<note place="margin">Order of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels againſt Pycenin.</note> his harguebuſſiers, and after them his croſſebowes, his archers, and the ſlinges, the reregard he enforced with his pikes, both <hi>Sclauonians</hi> and <hi>Albanians.</hi> He did not order his ſquadrons in groſſe, but parted them into ſeuerall bandes, each at large and a litle diſtant one from the other, to the intent that there might be ſome ſpace left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene ech of them, by which the men at armes and barded horſes of the enemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing receiued in amongeſt them might paſſe &amp; not trouble nor diſorder their rankes.

of their horſemen: and ſome of their owne horſes which were in the forefront of the battell neare the artillerie, ranne in amongſt their owne Harguebuſſiers and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers: where albeit they were grieuououſly wounded, yet did they cauſe a great confuſion and deſtruction of their owne people: inſomuch that on the right hand, the men at armes of <hi>Fraunce</hi> were compelled to turne their backes and to betake themſelues to flight.</p>
            <p>When the King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> perceiued the enemie to be in diſorder, he encreaſed their feare by preſſing in vpon them, ſo that the battalion of the <hi>Neapolitanes</hi> was left bare and naked of her flanckes. This was euen then when the infanterie on the one ſide and the other, being farre vnequall in hope and in puiſſance, came to affront ech other, and to ioyne together. The <hi>Albanois</hi> at the firſt onſet beganne of purpoſe to recuile and giue backe a litle from the battalion of the enemie: but anon after all of them at one inſtant both the wings and the ſquadrons, charging and preſſing v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them moſt furiouſly did ſoone cauſe them to ſhake and to diſrancke themſelues, and thus preſſing ſtill forward, they marched on a while as if nothing had ſtoode againſt them, the hindmoſt ſtill thruſting and bearing forwarde the foremoſt, in ſuch ſort that they had quite diſplaced the battalion of the enemies, and made them to leaue and forſake their grounde: (a thing which gaue them ſo huge a terrour) that it was of great force and efficacie to breake them for altogether. The reregard of the <hi>Angeuin</hi> namely, the <hi>Calabrians</hi> and the <hi>Genowaies</hi> preſently beganne to yeelde and to giue ground alſo: and hauing their recourſe to the battell of the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apolitanes,</hi> they did not onely not ſuſtaine and ſecond them, but rather on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie fearing leaſt if they which fought manfully in the forefront, ſhould be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen and diſcomfited, that then the enemie would breake in next vpon them: by litle and litle they beganne to recuile. Thus the <hi>Genowaies</hi> and the <hi>Calabrians</hi> beganne to make away, and turning their backes, one part of them retired to the ſecond battalion, and another part (as being forſaken on the one ſide, and exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the other) beganne to ſtrike in amongeſt their fellowes that denyed to receine and entertaine them: ſo that nowe you might haue ſeene as it were two conflicts at once mixed and intermingled together: the <hi>Neapolitanes</hi> being forced to defend themſelues both from theſe and from their enemies. Notwithſtanding they would not ſuffer them for all this to recuile within their ranckes (were they neuer ſo fierce and deſpitefull) but keeping cloſe together, and holding their rancks in good order on the open plaine, they repulſed theſe their troubleſome compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions who were quite forlorne, both by their owne flight and alſo by their blowes: for feare leaſt being ſuffered to enter amongſt them, they ſhould cauſe their battalion alſo (which as yet was ſure and whole) to be diſordered and brought in diſairay. By meanes of this tumult and great trouble, the place where they fought ſo obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately in the head of the reregard, was ſo filled and peſtered with the dead bodies of thoſe which were then ſlaine and with weapons, that the paſſage there was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt more hard and difficult, then through the thickeſt of the enemies: but the pikemen were the firſt that made themſelues way, who paſſing ouer thoſe high heapes of the dead, and of their weapons which lay ſcattered about: and through the bloud of the ſlaughtered (which lay moſt horrible to looke vnto) followed cloſe after their enemies to the vttermoſt of their powers, ſo that their owne rancks beganne to growe into diſorder. The Harguebuſſiers and the croſſe bowes when they ſawe that their battell being gotten before them was (as it were) wandering, diſioyned and ſeparated from them, beganne to be greatly aſtoniſhed and abaſhed: <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> incontinently perceiued and manifeſtly ſawe the diſorder of the one
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:13368:217"/>
and the aſtoniſhments of the other: whereupon he cauſed the pikes to retire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues backe againe, and hauing beſtowed thoſe which were wounded in the rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the battell, he led forth the Harguebuſſiers and the Archers to the two points for the better ſtrengthening of the pikes and the middle battell. By this meanes the conflict beganne to be renued and to grow more cruell and deadly then before, and ſo continued the better parte of the day. Many there were that fell both on the one ſide and the other: but the victorie continuing ſtill variable and vncertaine, did ſway ſometimes to the one ſide and ſometimes to the other: for now were they bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied on all ſides, and euerie man had his handes full. Both ſides were equall or not much vnlike, in the qualitie of their weapons, in practiſe and experience militarie, in honour and reputation, and in the greatneſſe of hope and of the preſent daunger, but in number and multitude they were nothing equall: for therein the <hi>Albanois</hi> and <hi>Arragonois</hi> were ſuperiour and did exceede them, as alſo in courage and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and the rather for that they had put to flight both their light horſemen, and their men at armes: and hauing chaſed their firſt battell, hadde giuen the onſet vppon the ſecond. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Guirize</hi> hauing purſued and followed the chaſe after the enemies horſe that were fledde, were now retourned and in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to charge in vpon the backe of this battalion. This laſt charge and onſet did<note place="margin">Victorie of the Arragonois.</note> cauſe their vtter ruine and ouerthrow: for many were encloſed, and murthered vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the place, and many being ſcattered and diſperſed as they betooke themſelues to maine flight ouer the large and wide plaine: were forced by the horſmen to turne and returne here and there: ſo that being encloſed and (as it were) beſieged on all ſides: what with the bullettes and ſhot of the Harguebuſſiers, and what with the ſword both of horſe and foote that purſued them, many of them were ſhot and many of them were beaten downe and ſlaine: ſo that the ſlaughter on all partes was moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame and pitifull.</p>
            <p>The number of thoſe which were counted ſlaine that day in the field, both of <hi>Neapolitans</hi> and of their confederates, was valued to be better then foure thouſand: of priſoners there were taken about a thouſand, beſides fiue and twentie enſignes and ſtandards. Of the victors there died nere a thouſand. The Count <hi>Picenin</hi> and Duke <hi>Iohn</hi> with a fewe horſemen in their companie being compelled to yeelde and giue place to their ill fortune, did ſaue themſelues after that the combat was paſt all hope, and they withdrew themſelues amongeſt the thickeſt of thoſe that fled, eſcaping by the goodneſſe and ſwiftneſſe of their horſes. The Counte before his departure had giuen all good and ſufficient proofe of his valour both before and during the whole time of the battell, and <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> himſelfe both by his owne confeſſion, and of all thoſe (who were skilfull and practiſed in armes) did yeeld him this praiſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,<note place="margin">Count Picenin his praiſe and commendation</note> that he ordered and martialled his battelles that day with ſingular skill and iudgement. For, firſt his artillerie was placed in the head and front of his battels in regard that the force and violence thereof was intollerable. After it, followed the companies of mercenarie men and ſtraungers arranged in verie good order: againſt whom he was in hope that the troups <hi>Albanois</hi> ſhould haue bene oppoſed. After thoſe ſtrange ſuccours ſucceeded the <hi>French</hi> battallion, to keepe the other that they ſhould not flie when they thought good, for that being mingled of ſo many ſorts of peoples (whom deſire of gaine, and not theregard of their faith and honour did draw thither) he thought by meanes of the <hi>French</hi> following at their backes, they would be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced both to abide the ſhock and charge of the enemy and alſo hauing wearied and ſore trauelled them partly with their ſhot, and partly with the killing and wounding of them ſelues in the vauntgard: the violence and fury of the enemy would by this
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:13368:217"/>
meanes be much abated. And therefore had he placed immediately after them the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Neapolitanes,</hi> in whom conſiſted the ſtrength and ſinewes of their hope: to the intent that being in all things equall vnto the enemy, they might in this point haue the aduantage of them, when that they being freſhe, whole, and luſty, ſhould be oppoſed againſt the others already wearied and wounded, with their long fight againſt them of the vauntgard. As for the <hi>Genowaies</hi> and the <hi>Calabrians,</hi> he had ſeuered them a good ſpace from the reſt, as being a people in whom he had no truſt nor affiance whether they were either friendes or foes, and therefore had he reſerued them to the rereward.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>Picenin</hi> after this daies ſeruice, being (as it were) the laſt proofe of his vertue, being eſcaped from the field, went vp and downe <hi>Italy</hi> ſecret and vnknowen as a fugitiue and vagabond in a very poore eſtate and diſguiſed habite, till ſuch time<note place="margin">Francis Sforce duke of Millan</note> as being allured with the flattering ſpeeches, and entiſing wordes of <hi>Francis Sforce,</hi> then Duke of <hi>Millan,</hi> who beguiled him vnder the colour and pretence of a fained mariage, and made him his ſonne in law, and then ſhortly after ſent him as a friend to King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> by whom being receiued and entertained as an enemy, he was<note place="margin">Count Picenin his pitifull end.</note> in the end put to a pittifull and cruell death. The Duke <hi>Iohn</hi> being hardly and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſued by the horſemen of the King of <hi>Albany,</hi> by very good hap and ſingular Fortune recouered <hi>Troy,</hi> where he was receiued and drawen vp ouer the wals with<note place="margin">Duke Iohn his retraite into France.</note> a cord: and from thence flying away ſecretly by night towardes the ſea of <hi>Genes,</hi> by good chaunce he found there a Barke which caried him into <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> campe being ſacked, and the ſouldiours enriched with the ſpoiles<note place="margin">Ferdinand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in triumph</note> which they had gotten: the King entred into <hi>Naples</hi> with great pompe and triumph, and <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> with him, the priſoners being led on before them. Then in ſigne of gratulation and publicke ioy, all the temples were ſet open: ſolemne proceſsions were made, plaies and feaſts of all ſorts were publickly celebrated for three daies together. Theſe things thus accompliſhed, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> determined in the company of <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg</hi> to take armes for the recouery of all thoſe townes and places, which were lately<note place="margin">Ferdinand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couereth all his kingdome.</note> rebelled and reuolted to the <hi>Angeuins:</hi> and ſo well did he follow and diſpatch this voyage, that in a very ſhort ſpace, he pacified all the countrey, and reduced it to his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and deuotion, by the helpe and mediation of the King of <hi>Albany.</hi> For all of them were more willing to rely vpon his word, then vpon the faith of the king: fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that by reaſon of their reuolt, and the breach of their faith to his Maieſty: he would haue dealt very hardly and iniuriouſly with them: but they were very well aſſured, that the <hi>Albanois</hi> ſhould be ſo reſpected by <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> that if he gaue them his faith and promiſe in the word of a King, that they ſhould haue no wrong nor da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, neither in their perſons nor poſſeſsions. Thus by the means and interceſsion of this Prince, did the King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> in few daies reconquer his whole eſtate, and the <hi>Neapolitanes</hi> continued vnder his obeiſance in reſt &amp; quietnes, all former matters and offences being for euer forgiuen and forgotten.</p>
            <p>There remained yet one only difficulty to be remedied within <hi>Apulia,</hi> which <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi> alſo accompliſhed and effected in good and friendly maner. Within the towne<note place="margin">Trana.

Dayly there
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:13368:218"/>
came vnto him in great abundance huge troupes of lewd and looſe fellowes, drawen thither by the deſire and couetouſneſſe of gaine: and with the ſweetneſſe which they purchaſed vpon the Prouince. The report hereof being come to the eares of <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg,</hi> he had ſome ſpeech with the king touching this matter, whereuppon being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted<note place="margin">Scanderbeg goeth to talke with Fuſian.</note> to depart from his campe with a ſmall troupe choſen forth amongeſt his owne men, he marched directly on towardes <hi>Fuſian,</hi> who being enformed that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> came to ſeeke him, he went to meete him very well accompanied. Both the one and the other of them hauing ſingled themſelues from their company, and diſmounting from their horſes, cauſed their ſoldiers to retire on the one ſide and the other in equall and like diſtance, and ſo came to talke and conferre together all alone. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> was the firſt that boorded him with theſe ſpeeches.</p>
            <p>

Notwithſtanding (my friend <hi>Fuſian</hi>) if thou wilt doe me the honor to giue credit to my wordes, aſſure thy ſelfe it ſhall be for thy good, and thou ſhalt be in the good grace and fauour of the King, which if thou be wiſe, thou wilt not in any ſort refuſe nor deny: and I promiſe thee on my faith, that I will cauſe thee to finde ſuch honor and aduancement, as thy ſelfe ſhalt in reaſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, on condition that thou do reſigne and deliuer vp <hi>Trana,</hi> and the fortreſſe into his Maieſties hands.

            <p>
               <hi>Fuſian</hi> being puffed vp with the fauour of the popular ſort, and with his own good fortune and proſperity, was become verie proud and arrogant, and therefore he made <q>this anſwere to the Prince of <hi>Albany.</hi> That he meant not to leaue the poſſeſsion of the<note place="margin">Anſwer of Fuſian to Scanderbeg.</note> place vnto the King: except he were firſt ſatisfied and paied of all his wages and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from the time, the day, the houre, that he firſt came to the Kings ſeruice, euen to that preſent. And moreouer that he would haue the chiefe and principall place vnder the King, in the gouerment of his realme and kingome:</q> With many other ſuch conditions which he did rather preſcribe, then ſeeme to requeſt of the King his Maieſty, being notably preiudiciall to the honour and dignity roiall, and derogating greatly from the reputation of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> vnto whom he durſt make thoſe inſolent demands. After which alſo, he powred forth many vile and contumelious ſpeeches, both againſt <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and the Queene. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> could not any longer ſuffer this his inſolency, but choler and deſpite abounding in him, and his countenance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning<note place="margin">Scanderbeg ſeizeth vpon the perſon of Fuſian, and taketh him pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner.</note> to change, he tooke him by the necke, and ſo ſeized vpon him. The <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>begians</hi> making haſt to approch to their maiſter, bound him faſt, and lifted him to horſebacke without any tumult or trouble: the traine and company of <hi>Fuſian</hi> not any way contradicting them, or oppoſing them ſelues againſt it. <hi>Fuſian</hi> ſeeing him ſelfe captiue and in perill to fall to the mercy of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> began to make faire wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and was ſoone contented vpon condition he might enioy his liberty, to reſigne and yeeld vp <hi>Trana</hi> into his handes, which being accepted, and faith giuen to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:<note place="margin">Trana yeelded to Scanderbeg by Fuſian.</note> 
               <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> entred freely with his company into the place to take poſſeſsion thereof: and hauing aſſured it with a good and ſufficient garriſon, he releaſed <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> to goe at his pleaſure: who when he was deliuered and courteouſlie licenced to

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> after this happy exploit atchieued, returned to King <hi>Ferdinand:</hi> after which both of them being very glad and ioyous to ſee all troubles and ſeditions ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed and ſuppreſſed within the Realme, and hauing prouided and taken good order for the ſurety and ſafety of all the towns and places of any importance, they returned backe againe to <hi>Naples</hi> the chiefe &amp; capitall city of the kingdome, with new ioy and exceeding great triumph. And for the better encreaſing and honouring of the ſame, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Millan,</hi> and almoſt all the Princes and Potentates of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi> in ſigne of the ioy and great contentment which they conceiued for their good<note place="margin">Scanderbeg ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored with ambaſſades &amp; preſents from the Pope and other Princes of Italy.</note> and happy ſucceſſe, did viſite the King of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> with moſt honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ambaſſades, and rich and ſumptuous preſents. But aboue all the reſt, did the Pope honor the Prince of <hi>Albany</hi> with excellent gifts and rewards: for he did not only gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie him with gold, ſiluer, and other goods and temporall things, but he adorned him with moſt ample and large priuiledges, prerogatiues, and ſpirituall graces: making him alſo a faithfull and aſſured promiſe, that as ſoone as his holineſſe with the army of the <hi>Cruſado</hi> could poſsibly get into <hi>Epire,</hi> (which he purpoſed to doe very ſhortly, and to march in proper perſon againſt the Turkes:) he would then crowne him king of <hi>Epire, Macedonie, Thrace,</hi> and <hi>Romania,</hi> and would commit the army of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to his charge, and that he ſhould haue the commaund and gouernment of the ſame, as chiefe Generall of the warres againſt the Infidels.</p>
            <p>By this time was there a full and whole yeare paſt and fully complet, ſince the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuall of the <hi>Albanois</hi> into <hi>Apulia:</hi> now was the warre ended and determined, <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> reſtored and reeſtabliſhed in his kingdome, and all things ſettled within the prouince according to his owne deſire. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> therefore hauing had long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the King touching many affaires of great waight and importaunce, was now willing to prepare for his departure, and to appoint a time for his iourney by ſea homewardes. Wherefore <hi>Ferdinand</hi> (before he would accord or agree to any thing) firſt cauſed all his Chiefetaines and the Captaines of his army to be aſſembled, and in their preſence made a long oration: wherein he gaue <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> great thanks and infinite praiſes and commendations, oftentimes repeating and calling him by the name of Father: and by which euer after as long as he liued he neuer ceaſed to honor him. Afterwards he commaunded generall proceſsions and publicke praiers to be ſaied from Church to Church, whereat the King himſelfe, his Court, and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were preſent, and did aſsiſt them in all humility and deuotion. Other like ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and religious ceremonies were preſented and offered vp vnto God for their good and happy victory, as to the ſole and onely author and giuer of the ſame. After this he fell to triumphes, as turneies, iuſtes, and combattes, to publike and ſolemne hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, to pleaſant ſpectacles and ſhewes of all faſhions: the which being ended and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, the King made a great and bountifull largeſſe amongſt the ſouldiers of <hi>Albany:</hi> but principally vnto their King for a perpetuall ſigne and memorie of their mutuall<note place="margin">Townes in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulia giuen to Scanderbeg by king Ferdinand Trana.

            <p>To conclude, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> hauing cauſed the moſt part of his armie to go to <hi>Trana,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Scanderbeg taketh his fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well of king Ferdinand.</note> where his ſhippes and gallies did then attend him, and hauing taken his leaue of king <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> not without many kinde farewels, teares, and tokens of ſorrow, with many friendly embracements and mutuall congratulations: he departed from him at the laſt, being accompanied and conueied on his way throughout <hi>Apulia,</hi> with many Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and great Lordes of the countrey: the high waies alſo being filled with people who came ſcattered from all places, both out of the townes and countrey to ſee and to ſalute him.

            <p>This Monarch, whoſe hopes did aime at nothing elſe, then the dominion and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the vniuerſall world, being now puffed vp in pride, and growing inſolent by the happy ſucceſſe of thoſe his conqueſts: began to haue recourſe to his wonted and former attempts, which was, to inuade and ouerrunne <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> thinking to haue oppreſſed and broken him to nothing. For it grieued him exceedingly, that this one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man ſhould extend the glory of his triumphes ſo neare vnto him, and ſhould (as it were) braue him euen vnder his noſe. Wherefore leuying an army of 20000. men,<note place="margin">Sinam ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg with an armie of 20000.

But the Prince of <hi>Albany</hi> ſtanding alwaies vpon his gard, had after his returne to <hi>Croy,</hi> in very good time diſperſed abroad his eſpials, and renued his intelligencers neare about the <hi>Sultan:</hi> in ſuch ſort that he was aduertiſed of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and drift of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> ſo fitly and timely, that both he had the leiſure to leauy an army, and was the firſt that tooke the field. Notwithſtanding he kept himſelfe cloſe and in couert, attending the approach of the Saniacke: whereof as ſoone as he had

There did hetake him ſo vnprouided, and ſet vpon him ſo ſodainly, that he eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated both him and all his army, and that with ſo notable a ſlaughter and butcherie,<note place="margin">Victorie of Scanderbeg a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sinam and the Turkes at Mocrea.</note> that more then two third parts of them lay dead vpon the place: all their enſignes and all their baggage became a prey vnto the Chriſtians, who enioyed it as the reward for their paines and trauell. Their Generall had much adoe to ſaue himſelfe from the fury and heat of the ſlaughter by the ſpeedineſſe of his flight: thoſe which yeelded them ſelues priſoners, and whoſe liues were ſaued, were redeemed for money, the which together with the other ſpoile, the Prince of <hi>Albany</hi> freely left vnto his ſouldiers.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time had the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperour ſent an other Turke one of his<note place="margin">Aſſambeg with an armie of 30000. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg.

For as this Turke was furiouſly and valiantly fighting in that battell, the gardes of his body being all ſlaine and his ſides left all open, his horſe ſore hurt, though not deadly,<note place="margin">Aſſambeg wounded is in great extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie after the loſſe of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell of Ocrida.</note> himſelf was alſo wounded in the right arme with an arrow.

In this anguiſh (I ſay) &amp; griefe both of body and of minde, was <hi>Aſſambeg</hi> retired &amp; reſted himſelfe vpon a little mountaine, or rather in a thicke wood not farre from the borders of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and about foure myles from their campe, in a countrey altogether vnknowen vnto him, and where he was wholy ignoraunt of all the wayes, pathes, and paſſages. How be it he ſtayd not there long ere he was diſcouered by the vigilancie of the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours of the <hi>Albanois:</hi> for that one of them, who had bene ſent before day to diſcouer, &amp; to make ſearch ouer all the coaſt, hauing diligently ſurueyed all places, came ſpeede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto his Captaine, and acquainted him with the whole matter, onely in this one point was he deceaued, in that by reaſon of the ſhadow of the place &amp; the thicknes of<note place="margin">Aſſambeg hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in a wood is diſcouered and founde by Scanderbeg.</note> the wood, he thought the number of the enemies to be greater then they were in deed, and ſo had he aſſured it vnto his Generall. In ſo much that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> him ſelfe mounting on horſebacke, did make haſt in great heate to ſeize vpon theſe relickes of his victory, being accompanied with all his cauallary. The Turkes diſcerning his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a farre off, you need not doubt but it troubled them greatly, and they acquainted their Chiefetaine with the matter, who was more aggrieued then all of them. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly they fell to conſultation, and reſolued vpon a courſe which perhaps was vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming ſo great a chieftaine and braue ſouldiers, and yet was it both ſafe &amp; neceſſary: and that was to march without armes, and without their horſes, and ſo to go &amp; meet the conqueror. The captaine himſelf, who was the author of this counſell, led the way vnto his company, &amp; was the formoſt that went againſt him, being all ouer deformed with bloud and filth.

he tooke <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> his horſe by the reines of the bridle, and by three or foure good wordes, he ſaued the liues both of him ſelfe and his companie. For he found his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to be wonderfully paſſionated at his misfortune, vpon the ſpeech which he vſed vnto him.</p>

            </p>

For what thing is there more honorable or commendable, then to know and to be willing to vſe mercy and pity to an enemie, who is conquered, miſerable, and afflicted? <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg</hi> marched on with his armie, courſing vp and downe on all ſides here and there, and finding the Prouince to be cleare of all ambuſhments of the enemies, he returned to his campe, and from thence neare to <hi>Croy,</hi> where he ſolemnized the reſt of his ioy and gladneſſe for the victorie.</p>
            <p>Within a few dayes after came <hi>Iuſſumbeg</hi> being ſent likewiſe againſt the <hi>Epirot,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iuſſumbeg ſent with an armie of 18000.

For being entred into <hi>Scopia</hi> the chiefe city of <hi>Macedony</hi> with eighteene thouſand men: he preſumed and had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined<note place="margin">Scopia in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonie.</note> in his thoughts, that he would march euen into the heart and bowels of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> not conſidering with him ſelfe, nor looking into the late miſhap of <hi>Aſſambeg,</hi> ſuch was his raſhneſſe and temerity. His comming being reported to the king of <hi>Albanie,</hi> made him greatly to wonder, that theſe men could ſo ſtraungely and (as it were) ſo wilfully forget them ſelues: or rather at their immoderate deſire and vnſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thirſt which they had after his bloud and life. Then turning him to his ſouldiers thus he ſpake vnto them.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Goe to my good friends and companions, you that are borne to trauels, or rather<note place="margin">Speech of Scanderbeg to his ſoldiers, encouraging them againſt Iuſſumbeg.</note> to continuall victories: let vs go on to meete with this new enemy, and with this new Captaine let vs not refuſe to doe him this honour, who at the firſt ſhocke (I dare aſſure you) will giue vs good matter of honor and glory.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Euery man with loud clamours and acclamations did applaud his wordes, and ſo prepared them ſelues to follow their Chiefetaine: who drawing neare to <hi>Scopia,</hi> and hearing by his vauntcurrours, that the enemy had taken the field, gaue the ſignall vnto his ſouldiers to giue the onſet vpon them. The Barbarian (who was not prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<note place="margin">The battell of Scopia between Scanderbeg &amp; Iuſſumbeg.</note> neither in courage nor reſolution to the combat) receiued him notwithſtanding, yet ſo as he ſeemed to doe it with the countenaunce of one that came rather to talke of the matter, then to fight. For he did not thinke that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> would haue had either him ſo greatly in contempt and diſdaine: or that hardineſſe in him ſelfe, as
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:13368:221"/>
that he durſt (ſo farre off from his owne frontiers) come to hazard the fortune of a battell within the territories of his enemies: fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence (if he ſhould be vanquiſhed) he could not haue eſcaped, &amp; where he could not either repaire his forces: or (though he were victorious) be well aſſured, nor in ſafetie. This was the reaſon that the Pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim, euen at the very beginning, looſing both ſtrength &amp; courage, did find no courſe better nor more expedient, then to turne head and make haſt away: ſhewing the way vnto his people of a moſt ſhamefull and ignominious flight: who kept him company<note place="margin">Victorie of Scanderbeg a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Iuſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg.</note> in like maner, excepting ſome 300. or thereabouts, who preferring their honor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their liues, died valiantly with their armes in their hands. But they that fled found themſelues in worſe caſe by flying then they expected. For, whereas they ſuppoſed that they might haue fled with ſafetie, and ſhould not haue bene purſued by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, by reaſon they were in their owne countrey, and, as it were, vpon their owne dunghill: therein they were greatly deceiued, and with thoſe their fellowes which<note place="margin">Number of Turkes ſlaine at the battell of Scopia.</note> were before ſlaine in the fight, they made vp the full number of 2000. at the leaſt. There were very few taken priſoners, by reaſon of the great difficulties and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities which hindred the ſafe conucying of them, as alſo becauſe of the length of their retrait which they were to make, for that the paiſants might haue aſſailed them on their way. <hi>Iuſſumbeg</hi> thought to haue rallied his troupes, and to haue layed ſome ambuſhment, or to haue dreſſed ſome deuiſe for the entrapping of the enemie: but his ſouldiers would not by any meanes hearken vnto him, but holding on their ſcattered courſe, they had a greater deſire to returne home (though it were with the diſpleaſure of their Prince) then not to returne home at all. And they excuſed themſelues vpon this their diſcomfiture and ouerthrowe giuen them by <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be a ſufficient reaſon and lawfull cauſe of their refuſall. But <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> for all this wanted not ſome one or other to be the ſucceſſour of ſo many and great dangers, neither was he at any time without enemies.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the eldeſt and moſt auncient Chieſtaines of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> there was one an <hi>Aſiatique</hi> named <hi>Carazabeg,</hi> a very graue and auncient perſonage, and of ſpeciall marke and reputation, by reaſon of many honorable places of charge, and diuerſe<note place="margin">Carazabeg ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met to be ſens againſt Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg.</note> voyages wherein he had bene employed, and had acquitted himſelfe well and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely. The <hi>Sultan</hi> alſo had him in great account, and hauing placed him in no ſmall authoritie, he retained him neare about his owne perſon, as of late alſo his father <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murath</hi> had done the like. This aged Sire, as if he had bene ſome young hotſpurre, found himſelfe pricked on with the ſpurres of his glorie (or rather misfortune) which ſeemed continually to lye in waite to ſeduce and entrap the greateſt and moſt notable perſons to the intent it might obſcure the brightneſſe of all their former renowme, and the merites of their forepaſſed triumphs, by the vnhappie ſucceſſe of this warre of <hi>Epire:</hi> for neither the late ignominie and opprobrious ſpectacle of <hi>Iuſſumbeg,</hi> nor the like miſhap which had euer attended vpon ſo many others beſides him, nor yet the fatal deſtiny of the <hi>Albanian</hi> felicitie, which had continued euen to that day, could not any thing diſſwade him, but that he was deſirous to proue his fortune againſt <hi>Scanderbeg:</hi> wherfore repairing to the preſence of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> he thus ſpake vnto him.</p>
            <p>Hitherto (moſt ſoueraigne Prince) and euen vnto this day, both vnder thy <q>Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie,<note place="margin">Oration of Carazabeg, to Mahomat, deſiring to be employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg.</note> and vnder thy father of happie memorie, I haue heaped vp and obtained in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſo many triumphs by my merits, as yeares by my age and courſe of life. But now both the one and the other of them is grieuous and lothſome vnto me, and I take no pleaſure to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber them, through an extreme deſpite which I haue conceiued, to ſee <hi>Sca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derbeg</hi> obtain ſo many victories: to ſee the many ouerthrows &amp; diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fitures which he hath giuen vs: &amp; to ſee the pride and inſolency of the <hi>Albanians.</hi> I am reſolued (as
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:13368:222"/>
old and vnfit as I am for armes) to abandon all to the hazard and chance of fortune, and either to bring vnto thee, and to proſtrate before thy feete dead or aliue this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and vngratefull wretch, ſometimes the ſlaue of the houſe of <hi>Ottoman,</hi> &amp; now the king of the vnhappie <hi>Epirots:</hi> to the intent he may be accomptant vnto thee for the ſlaughter of ſo many and ſo great armies, and for the death of ſo many of thy noble &amp; worthie chieftaines: or elſe this head and this throate of mine ſhall more and more enoble the glory of his fame and reputation. Giue me leaue therefore (moſt worthie Emperour) preſently to leuie forces, and to muſter an armie to my owne liking: I my ſelfe will take vpon me the charge and managing of this matter, not as a commander, but as thy miniſter: and both in the chuſing, the arming and the trayning of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, I will not relye vpon any other perſon, but my ſelfe alone will looke to the handling and diſpatching of all things. For it is with a notable thiefe and a famous robber that we haue to do: and the warre which we make, is with ſuch a one, as is an arch maiſter in pollicies and ſleights of ſubtiltie: who is growen haughtie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent with his many victories, and who is as it were fatted with the multitude of the ſpoyles which he hath gotten of vs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Whatſoeuer this Turke demaunded, was freely and fully accorded vnto him by the <hi>Ottoman,</hi> who referred all to his diſcretion, &amp; added vnto his demand an ouerplus<note place="margin">Carazabeg ſent with an armie of 40000. Turkes againſt Scanderbeg.</note> often thouſand men: for him ſelfe had made choiſe onely of thirtie thouſand, with whom he thought to haue put this matter in execution, notwithſtanding that it was of ſo great importance. He ſent before him certaine ſpies, whom he willed to diſperſe them ſelues ouer the countrey, for to diſcouer and giue him ſome intelligence of the enemie. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> on the other ſide wanted no good aduertiſements, both through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the prouince of <hi>Epire,</hi> and in <hi>Macedonie,</hi> and alſo in the heart and moſt inward partes of the enemies countrey, by meanes whereof the iourney and comming on of <hi>Carazabeg</hi> was ſoone made knowen vnto him, in ſuch ſort that our men had both time and oportunitie to make readie their preparations. But when <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> heard this newes reported vnto him, the report is, that he vſed this ſpeech vnto ſome that were neare him:</p>
            <p>
               <q>If this Chieftaine (quoth he) were not too farre ſtriken in yeares and ouer aged, I<note place="margin">Speeches of Scanderbeg touching Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razabeg.</note> ſhould haue feared him alone, more then all his great puiſſaunce which he bringeth with him: (for both of them knew each other very inwardly, and they had bene companions in armes in a certaine voyage made into <hi>Aſia</hi> vnder <hi>Amurath</hi>) much better (ſayd he) and more wiſely ſhould <hi>Carazabeg</hi> haue done, if he had made ſpare and taken compaſſion of his old age, and eſpecially of his fortune which ſeemeth now to faint and to be ouer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wearied, and doth as it were, repent her ſelfe of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold victories and fauours which ſhe hath beſtowed vpon him. Wherfore though he be now fiftie yeares of age, yet being growen as it were, crazie and decrepit, I haue no reaſon to ſtand in awe of him, whom euen in the ſtrength and prime of his youth, my ſelfe being then but a child and in a manner a verie infant, I did ſo little feare, that I did euen deſpiſe and contemne him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Hauing thus ſpoken, he aſſembled his forces greater and more in number then thoſe which he had againſt <hi>Aſſambeg,</hi> by reaſon of the great fame and renow me of the Turkiſh Captaine. Then truſſing vp baggage, he tooke his way into <hi>Dybria:</hi> and from thence with two thouſand horſe he ranne vp euen to the confines of the <hi>Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballians</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ambuſcade layd by Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg againſt Carazabeg.</note> (for in this place was the comming of the Turke expected.) And he layd them in an ambuſcado here and there throughout the mountaines, to the intent he might encloſe the enemy in the middeſt of his forces, and take them at an aduantage. The Barbarian likewiſe hauing cauſed the maine body of his armie to ſtay in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:13368:222"/>
place within <hi>Macedonie</hi> commonly called <hi>Chieri</hi>) had ſent before 4000. horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,<note place="margin">Chieri.</note> who being diſcouered, were ſuddenly charged by the <hi>Albanois,</hi> the greater part<note place="margin">Turkes to the number of 4000. of the armie of Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeg defeated by Scanderbeg.</note> of them being diſcomfited and ſlaine, and the reſt being ſcattered and diſperſed in their flight, caried the newes of their misfortune to their Generall before that euer he came neare to the confines of <hi>Epire.</hi> He therfore being before ſufficiently weakned with age &amp; ſicknes, began by the aſtoniſhment of this miſhap to grow more faint both in mind and in body: being not ſo much aggrieued at the loſſe of his men, as that his coming was diſcloſed and diſcouered to the Chriſtian. Many and diuerſe things did he caſt &amp; deuiſe vpon in his mind, being in doubt what courſe to take, &amp; whether it were beſt for him to hold on his iourney, or elſe to turne head towards <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> &amp; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre this expedition till the next ſpring: for the Autumne was now in a maner at an end. In the end, ſhame &amp; feare of diſhonor did ſo farre preuaile with the old man, that he thought it not beſt to giue ouer the warre. Hauing therefore in two dayes ſpace, diſpatched almoſt all his iourney towardes his enemie, about the firſt watch of the night he came to a certaine plaine, which they of the countrey call <hi>Liuad,</hi> where he<note place="margin">The playne of Liuad.</note> encamped his armie, and the ſame night he ſet all things in order &amp; readineſſe againſt the time of the conflict: and the next morning he ſent an herauld vnto <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> to giue him the defiance, challenging him to the encounter in a ſet, open, and plaine bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and not ſecretly and by ſtealth, after the maner of theeues and robbers. <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg</hi> terming him a Dotard, and an old Beldam, told him, he ſhould heare of him ere long: and without any pauſe, he went on roundly to giue the onſet vpon him, who was not yet readie to receiue him, but ſtood conſulting vpon his buſineſſe, as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner<note place="margin">Carazabeg charged by Scanderbeg within his campe.</note> of old men is. Notwithſtanding he ſuſtained the brunt of that charge wel enough, by meanes of a great ſhowre of raine that fell at the very beginning of the onſet: the which did ſoone ſeparate them aſunder: ſo that there was nothing done worthie the remembring.

Wherefore (my good <hi>Scanderbeg</hi>) as often as I do call to minde both theſe and other matters wherwith our age at that time was delighted: &amp; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer remembring all that which thou haſt heretofore done for the ſeruice of our Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, for the houſe of the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> and for the glory &amp; enlarging of our crowne and dignitie: my deſire and endeuor is to loue and to make much of thee with all poſſible and moſt ardent affection. And I proteſt before God, that nothing can happen vnto me more acceptable or more agreeable in this life, then to ſee thee neare about me, and for a time to enioy thy preſence. If our ſouldiers haue of late violently inuaded thy dominions, or entred vpon thy realme, committing there any exceſſe or outrage, yet ought not that to be any occaſion or impediment to hinder thee from comming vnto vs. For whatſoeuer hath been done in that caſe, was without our command or knowledge: and (as reaſon would) I haue and do take it in very ill part, neither doth it in any ſort diſpleaſe me that they haue bene chaſtiſed for their miſdeeds, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced according to their deſerts.

                  <p>Moſt noble and renowmed Prince, we haue receiued thy letters, &amp; by the contents<note place="margin">Letters of Scanderbeg to Mahomet.</note> thereof haue ſeene the greatneſſe of thy loue and ſingular affection, which thou doeſt proteſt to beare vnto me: and which (as thou ſaieſt) hath bene ratified by our olde and auncient nouriture and education, and is ſo bound and deepely rooted by long vſe and conuerſation, that being in a manner conuerted into a ſecond nature it ſhall flouriſh and endure betweene vs perpetually. Thou ſaieſt alſo, that whereas this our familiaritie is (as it were) laide a ſleepe and in a manner diſcontinued, by reaſon that we haue beene ſo farre and ſo long diſioyned and ſeuered each from other, thou haſt a great and earneſt deſire to reuiue and recontinue the ſame by ſome newe league of friendſhip and amitie: the conditions whereof thou doeſt propound to be theſe. Firſt that thy troupes may haue free and ſure paſſage through our countrie, to inuade and endamage the <hi>Venetians:</hi> to which thy demand, we cannot, nor may not conſent nor agree without the manifeſt breach of all right and equitie, and without great diſhonor to our royall eſtate and dignitie, for that the <hi>Venetians</hi> are our allyes and confederates. And as touching thy deſire to haue my ſonne for an hoſtage for the ſurer confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the peace betweene vs, it might be peraduenture that I would gladly doe it, if the affection of a father did not diſſwade and detaine me from it. But he being my onely childe, and of a verie young and tender age, nowe that it behoueth him to be nouriſhed and trayned vp in our manners and cuſtomes, he cannot be taken from the embracements of his parents, without the great and ſingular preiudice both of himſelfe and me. As for that which thou requireſt of me concerning thy ſubiects and marchants, that they may haue free paſſage to come and go, to buy, ſell, and traffique their wares and marchandice throughout our Dominions: all my Captaines doe like and allow of the motion, and my ſelfe alſo, who doe deſire nothing more then that the traffique and trade of marchandice may haue his full and free courſe euerie where betweene vs. Moreouer thou doeſt inuite me with great ſhew of affection to come and viſite thee, and that I ſhould not doubt to doe it in all confidence and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, to the intent that our mutuall ſight and conuerſation each with other, might ſatisfie the deſire of our ſo long continued abſence. I doe highly commend moſt worthy Prince, the bountie of thy minde, and the liberalitie of thy good nature and diſpoſition, in regard whereof, if my vrgent affayres, and the managing of this my eſtate would giue me leaue, or would affoord me any time of leaſure and oportunitie, I would be ſo bold and hardie as to embrace thy good aduiſe and counſell. But what ſhould I doe? I haue here my ſonne a very infant, a child of a moſt weake and tender age, and altogether vnfit and vnmeete for the rule and gouernement of this Realme, or the publique affaires of my eſtate. Moreouer, my people (as thou knoweſt) is a Nation altogether impatient of reſt and idleneſſe: they are a fierce and vntamed kind

               <pb n="435" facs="tcp:13368:224"/>Fortie dayes were fully paſt and expired ſince that the Turkiſh Herauld made his firſt voyage to <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> about the treatie of this peace, at ſuch time as he returned now againe with this ſecond charge and commiſſion for the full ratifying &amp; conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the ſame according to the mind and liking of the King of <hi>Albany,</hi> who hauing receiued it, cauſed the ſame to be read openly before all his Princes and Chiefetaines whom he had aſſembled to that intent and purpoſe. All of them were well conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and did allowe of the peace, as being for the honour and benefite of the whole Prouince: wherefore the matter being thoroughly concluded and paſt betweene the two Princes, the peace was ſolemnely and publique proclaimed in all the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters<note place="margin">Peace betwene Scanderbeg &amp; Mahomet.</note> and principall places of their Realmes and Dominions, to the great ioy and contentment of them all in generall: and it was faithfully kept and obſerued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene their peoples and ſubiectes for the ſpace of two yeares or thereaboutes, till ſuch time as the Barbarians and Infidelles were the infringers and breakers of the ſame. The occaſion of the breach thereof I thinke needeleſſe to be deliuered, conſidering that the onely reaſon that led them to deſire this peace, was that they might with the more eaſe enlarge and amplifie their Empire, by the dammage and detryment of others, and that the <hi>Epyrots</hi> in the meane while might be lulled a ſleepe in ſecuritie. Nowe therefore they did ſhewe them ſelues to be the firſt brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the league, and they violated the fayth which had beene ſolemnely ſworne<note place="margin">1463. The peace bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken &amp; violated by the Turkes who inuade Epyre.</note> and vowed, inuading in hoſtile manner the landes and territories of the <hi>Albanois</hi> from whence they carried away an ineſtimable prey and bootie. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> finding himſelfe highly aggrieued at the matter, complained thereof by many letters and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſades ſent of purpoſe vnto the <hi>Sultan.</hi> But all the anſwere he had of him, was, that it was done vnknowen to him and without his conſent and priuitie. And he fed him with good words and faire promiſes, that he would take order to ſee it remedied, and feigning himſelfe to be diſpleaſed with thoſe that did it, he cauſed ſome part of the bootie to be reſtored.</p>
            <p>This happened about the ſame time, that the Infidels did likewiſe ouerunne<note place="margin">Venetian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Turkes.

That there could not be anie ſuch friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or amitie betwene the Turkes and the <hi>Epyrots,</hi> for that they were euen by nature enemies ech to other. That he ſhould note and obſerue it well, how that the Infidell (after he had once aſſured himſelfe not to be troubled by the armes of the <hi>Albanois</hi>)
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:13368:225"/>
had ſuddenly bent and conuerted his forces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> againſt the <hi>Raſcians</hi> and <hi>Triballians:</hi> and hauing brought them vnder his ſubiection, he went againſt the <hi>Thracians</hi> and the <hi>Illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> and laſt of all hauing ſubuerted and aboliſhed the Empire of the <hi>Greekes,</hi> he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned the Empire of <hi>Trebiſond</hi> likewiſe to his owne crowne and Monarchy. Now therefore that he had ſurmounted and made a conqueſt of all others: and that fortune ſeemed to ſmile vpon him in all his actions, what other thing reſted there for him to enterpriſe, but to oppreſſe and ſwallowe vp him alſo, and ſo to ſurpriſe all of them one after another? That it behoued them therefore betimes to looke vnto it, and that ioyning their forces and meames all in one, it were farre better to haue him for their open and profeſſed enemie, then for their cruell and couetous Lorde and Maſter. That it were meere folly to thinke that the intent &amp; meaning of the Turke was only to ſpoyle, waſte, and deſtroy the Prouinces and Dominions of the Chriſtians, and not to extirpate and aboliſh their religion: for the verie name and profeſſion of Chriſtianitie was ſo odious and hatefull to thoſe Miſcreants, as their whole drift and meaning is to roote out both the knowledge and the remembrance there of from the face of the earth. Wherefore the moſt ſafeſt, fitteſt, and ſhorteſt courſe for them was to get the ſtart of the Infidell, and in time to oppoſe themſelues againſt the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, rather then to ſtay till they ſhould find themſelues oppreſſed by their enemies, and then to goe ſeeke a remedie for their woundes. That all the peoples and nations of Chriſtendome did call vpon him, entreat him and inuite him thereunto: that the moſt noble and famous Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> by name, did inſtantly pray and requeſt him to betake himſelfe to armes, offering to furniſh him with gold, ſiluer and men, and with all other things and prouiſions whatſoeuer that ſhould be needfull and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for ſuch an expedition.</p>

and to make them knowen vnto the worlde which are the authors of vice and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, is a thing not only delectable and delightfull, but it is greatly profitable and beneficiall: becauſe that men being terrified by their examples, may abſtaine from miſchiefe and vitious actions. And therefore as vertue ought not to be ſuffered to goe vnrewarded or to be without commendation, ſo ought vice likewiſe to be checked and reprehended. For by the one and the other of thoſe twaine, do we reape like frute and benefite both by the exalting of the good and the ſuppreſſing of the wicked. This then is a thing both iuſt and reaſonable, that they which are vicious and lewdly giuen ſhould heare their wickedneſſe openly reproued and condemned: and aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers this Turkiſh tyrant <hi>Mahomet,</hi> as being one that farre ſurpaſſeth and excelleth in all kindes of miſchiefe and villanies: whoſe life, manners, and deteſtable deedes, I hold it not amiſſe briefely to runne ouer, and to lay open, to the intent they may be the better knowen vnto thee, and that thou maieſt the ſooner ſhun and eſchew them. Firſt of all, to ſay nothing of his originall and ofſpring as that he is deſcended of the <hi>Scithians,</hi> iſſued out of a baſe village called <hi>Otmanach</hi> from whence proceeded the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the <hi>Ottomans:</hi> this <hi>Mahomet</hi> being endowed with a notable vigour &amp; dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie both of ſpirit and of bodie, but of a moſt peruerſe and miſcheeuous nature, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the common enemie of mankind, a cruell bloudſucker, a chiefe ringleader to all vice, a Prince of all wickedneſſe, delighting in the death and deſtruction of men, the father of all miſchiefes, and an vnſatiable murtherer. And as his aunceſtors were of litle better diſpoſition, ſo hath he retayned this barbarous fierceneſſe and intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, perſeuering in the whole courſe of his life in one and the ſame peruerſeneſſe of a moſt crooked and diueliſh nature. From the very beginning of his youth, he hath euer had a ſingular delight in warres, murthers, rapines and diſſentions, and in theſe hath he alwayes bene trayned and exerciſed. A man of a moſt ſtout courage and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datious, and withall variable and vnconſtant, full of deceipt and double dealing, a deepe diſſembler in all his actions, greedy of other mens goods, burning in his owne luſtes and deſires, and continually couetous of things immoderate and vnpoſſible. Firſt of all there grew in him an vnmeaſurable deſire of money, and afterwardes of Empire and dominion: his ſoule being plentifully furniſhed with wicked and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable artes, wanteth not corrupt and lewd luſtes, a moſt ſhameleſſe ribaud, a common adulterer, an inuenter of new vices which euen nature it ſelfe hath in horror and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation. This is that ſame <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who of an ambitious humour ſtrangled his owne naturall brother, and with notable treachery and infidelitie murthered the Princes of <hi>Raſcia,</hi> and the King of <hi>Boſnia:</hi> and all thoſe which were of their bloud and linage, ſome of them he brought into miſerable bondage and ſeruitude, others he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of their ſight, and put out their eyes, or elſe mangled them in ſome part of their bodies. What ſhould I ſpeake of infinite others, vppon whom he hath practiſed all kindes of torments? and I doe verily beleeue that in the end, if he find none elſewhere vpon whom to execute his monſtrous crueltie, he will not ſpare to vſe it againſt him ſelfe, ſo infinitely is his nature enclined to fierceneſſe and inhumanitie, that the wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and fierie rage of his minde can neuer be contented or ſatisfied. For towards God his ſoule is moſtimpure, towards men it is dangerous, and it neuer ceaſeth from plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and contriuing how to worke the dammage and ruine of others. He maketh no account of the amitie or enmitie of any man, but only to ſerue his owne turne. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth not to keepe a meane or meaſure in any thing, but committeth all kinde of villanies and cruelties againſt his friends and againſt his owne ſubiects. He ſpoyleth and robbeth the temples both in publique and in priuate, he profaneth all holy and ſacred things, he polluteth all things, he ſeizeth vpon euery thing, he maketh no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

of honour and diſhonour, of ſhame and ſhamefaſtneſſe, of honeſtie and diſhone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, of diuine things and of humaine things: but he mingleth &amp; confoundeth them one with another. All thoſe to whom he euer gaue any faith or made any promiſe, hath he not contrary to his faith &amp; his owne couenants, either ſubdued them or ſlaine them, or enthralled them? Is it therefore any noueltie moſt worthy Prince, if this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inted <hi>Mahomet</hi> do not keepe his word and promiſe with thee? eſpeciàlly ſeeing that he being defiled and polluted with all kind of vice, doth poſſeſſe impietie (as it were) by diſcent, and his periurie is hereditarie vnto him. Truſt not therefore to this tyrant, build not vpon his promiſes, but ſhake off his acquaintance and repute that peace for diſſolued and broken which he was not affraid firſt of all to infringe and violate, and let it not cauſe thee to refraine from inuading his dominions with ſworde and fire. Prouide I ſay, prouide for thy ſelfe and thy eſtate (moſt prudent Prince) for feare leaſt the Barbarian doe by his traines entrappe and oppreſſe all of vs. This falſe traitor who is ſo well beaten and practiſed in fraud and ſubtiltie, deuiſeth nor meditateth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nothing elſe, but only how he may deſtroy and extirpate the faith of Chriſt, for the which (as thou knoweſt) thou diddeſt once determine, yea thou diddeſt vowe by a ſolemne oath, that thou wouldeſt alwayes labour and trauell euen to the death: and I doe well remember, I haue oftentimes heard thee ſay, That onely for the defence and preſeruation thereof, thou diddeſt thinke thy ſelfe to be created and to be borne into this worlde. What reaſon then haſt thou, ô <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> (pardon me I beſeech thee in ſpeaking it) to lay aſide thy armes? what, wilt thou nowe liue for thy ſelfe alone? doeſt thou thinke that thy eſtate will be little or nothing the worſe, in that thou being an olde ſouldier doeſt now ſit ſtill and doe nothing? is it not a ſhame that any man-ſhould ſee that ſame ancient liuelineſſe and quickneſſe of ſpirit in ſo excellent and worthie a Prince, now to waxe ruſtie through idleneſſe, and to vaniſh away to nothing? the ſtirring ſpirit of thy good friend <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> is not idle: he doeth not paſſe away the time in ſloth, nor ſitteth ſtill as thou doeſt. He accuſtometh himſelfe to waking and watching, he laboureth and beſtirreth himſelfe, and he haſteneth with all poſſible ſpeed and celeritie, to defile and prophane the Goſpell of the ſonne of God: to ouerwhelme the ſhip of bleſſed Saint <hi>Peter:</hi> to teare and rend in peeces the coate of Chriſt our ſauiour being without ſeame: fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing therein the ſteppes of his aunceſtors, and the traditions of his falſe Prophet, who ordained that the name of Ieſus Chriſt ſhould be perſecuted as prophane and odious: and that the bloud of the innocent and faithfull Chriſtians ſhould be ſpilt by thoſe which were his followers: hence is it, that this bloudie hangman hath conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually more then any other, purſued the faith and religion of the Chriſtians with a moſt mortall and deadly hatred: againſt whom if thou moſt worthie Prince, doeſt not diſplay thy armes: if thou doeſt not aduance thy forces: if thou doe not inuade and make warre vpon him, it is not to be doubted, but that all men generally will repute and hold thee for faint hearted, fearefull, and giuen ouer to ſloth and idlenes. Haſt thou not heard how all the Kings and Princes of the Catholike faith together with the ſoueraigne paſtor of the church haue conſpired againſt this bloudie tirant and are fully determined by God his aſſiſtance to purſue and perſecute him with all their power and puiſſance, and to expell him wholly out of <hi>Europe?</hi> Alreadie hath the holy father ſent forth his Bull, and publiſhed the ſame throughout all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, by vertue whereof all thoſe Kings and chriſtian Princes, are to haue full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of their ſinnes aſſoone as they ſhall come to accompanie the ſupreame Biſhop and ſhall march with him againſt this curſed enemie both of God and men.</q> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Venetians,</hi> both the Duke and the Senate alſo, who haue made incredible</p>

Stirre vp once againe the vigour of thy haughty courage &amp; of thy puiſſant forces, call together thy Chieftaines, leauy men &amp; ſouldiers from all parts, inuite the Princes thy neighbours &amp; confederates, dreſſe in a readineſſe, and diſpoſe in order thy ſquadrons and thy legions: march on before the generall aſſembly of the faithfull, and the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſtians, conforme thy ſelfe to the will and counſell of the vniuerſall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, purchaſe thou pardon for thy owne offences, and for thy army likewiſe.

Thou knoweſt that the <hi>Venetians</hi> are moſt Chriſtian Princes, moſt bountifull, and moſt puiſſant both by ſea and by land: they doe promiſe and proffer vnto thee, golde, ſiluer, and men, in all plentifull manner.

March on therefore, march on hardily before the Catholique armie, giue the firſt charge and attempt vpon thy enemie: denounce open and generall warre to the Barbarian: prepare the waye to the ſoueraigne Paſtour of Chriſtendome: for behold now Pope <hi>Pius,</hi> behold the <hi>Venetians,</hi> behold the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Almaines,</hi> the <hi>Spaniardes,</hi> the <hi>Flemmings,</hi> the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> the <hi>Polonians,</hi> the <hi>Italians,</hi> and brieflie, all Chriſtian nations and peoples doe follow after thee, and they doe come to helpe and to ſecond thee: now therefore will not this Pagan, this <hi>Mahometist</hi> be euer able to reſiſt ſo many Kings, ſo many Princes, ſo many nations and warlike armies: he will ſoone betake himſelfe to flight, he will ſoone forſake and forgoe <hi>Europe:</hi> the pride and inſolencie of the <hi>Ottoman,</hi> his fraudulent and deceiptfull dealings, his ſecret traines and wicked deuiſes will now profit him litle or nothing: his wonted policies and ſleightes will not be able to helpe him.

There were two eſpeciall yet diuerſe and different opinions: the one which argued that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and thoughts of the <hi>Albanians</hi> were now eſtranged from deeds of armes (as it is <q>commonly ſeene, that the ſweetnes of gaine and interreſt doth corrupt and oaſtardize our ſpirits, and by litle and litle doth make them to degenerate into another nature)<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> they would in no caſe heare any ſpeech of renuing the warre with <hi>Mahomet,</hi> but they wiſhed that the couenants and conditions of the peace concluded betweene them ſhould be in all points obſerued and fulfilled:</q> of the wdich (ſaied ſome of them) there doth proceed great benefit and commoditie: the people, the townes and cities, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rich and welthy, and their profit was like daily to be augmented: beſides that, the Turkiſh monarch had reſtored in a maner all the pillage which had bene taken vpon the countrie of the <hi>Albanois.</hi> The other opinion was cleane contrarie: for they held that in any caſe it was needfull to haue recourſe to armes, and that they ought not to truſt to the wordes of the <hi>Sultan</hi> who neuer kept his promiſe with any, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with any that was a Chriſtian: and that ſo much the rather they ought to doe it for that he had firſt broken the peace, and had violated the ſumme of the capitulations paſt betweene them. Moreouer that there was litle or no faith to be giuen to the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or to his promiſes, which tended to no other end then to draw them on by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and cunning, and to entertaine them with faire wordes now that he ſaw all the Chriſtians ioyned in league againſt him: and that ſhortly he was like to feele the weight and burthen of their fearefull and terrible forces to the ſingular dammage of the circumciſed: which was the onely cauſe that kept him in feare and awe, and that brought him to this point to promiſe wonders: that otherwiſe he would neuer haue ſuffered them to reſt in quiet nor would haue reſtored the bootie which had bene taken: that therefore it behooued them without delay, and with moſt cheerefull and reſolute mindes, to begin the warre againſt this common enemie of the Chriſtian faith, the preſeruation wherof was to be preſerred before their owne particular ſafety and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie: and ſo much the rather, for that the head of the church did mind to be there in perſon, and to come with all his forces of Chriſtendome in armes againſt the <hi>Mahometan.</hi> This latter opinion being held as the beſt and moſt ſound, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo moſt agreeable to the mind and liking both of the King and the better part of his Captaines, was allowed and choſen as being for the good and benefit of them all: and it was fully concluded &amp; agreed, that they ſhould renue the wars &amp; take armes for the defence of the common weale of Chriſtendome. Beſides they held it requiſite, and an acte well beſeeming Chriſtians, to be obedient to the ſupreme Biſhop and the vicar of Chriſt, &amp; to adhere cloſe to the congregation of the faithfull. Moreouer there was not any one of them but would haue made it ſcrupulous to reproue the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Archbiſhop, whoſe counſels and admonitions they held it no leſſe needful to obſerue and obey, then as if they had bene the diuine precepts. For (as we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie ſaid) the grauitie, good life and worthie example of this perſonage had purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him wonderfull authoritie amongſt them: inſomuch that all matters were mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by his counſell and ſage aduiſe: for that ordinarily being with the King in court, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> would euer harken &amp; giue eare vnto him, and had learned of him all the ancient hiſtories and worthy exploits both of the <hi>Greeks</hi> &amp; <hi>Latines:</hi> and he was alſo maruellouſly well beloued of all the Chieftaines, Lordes and Princes of <hi>Albanie.</hi> The

            <p>Vpon the rumor and report of this newes, thoſe ſouldiers of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> which lay in garriſon vpon the frontiers were the firſt that tooke the field, and they ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranne<note place="margin">Epirots inuade and ouerrunne the Turke his territories.</note> and ranſacked the countrie of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> with great violence and terror to the inhabitants: and hauing farre and wide forraged and waſted all places, they reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a notable prey and bootie, driuing away with them at the leaſt 60000. head of kine, and oxen, 80000. ſheepe, and 3000. mares with their coltes which were of the race and breed that the <hi>Ottoman</hi> had for his owne ſtore: and yet this was not all: for being entred verie farre into the prouince of the Barbarian, they put all to ſword and fire, and left not ſtanding vpon the ground either trees or any thing elſe bearing frute, but filled all parts with horrible feare and terror: the tidings whereof when it came to the eares of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> he was newly enflamed and incenſed againſt <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg</hi> beyond all credit and imagination: neuertheleſſe afterwards ſtroking his forhead with his hand, and ſuppreſſing his extreame griefe, the report is, that with a cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and gladſome countenance, he vttered theſe wordes.

For (as I am gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to vnderſtand) thou haſt with great forces inuaded my lands and territories, and turning all things vpſide downe in moſt pitifull and foule diſorder, thou haſt gotten and carried away an ineſtimable booty &amp; infinite goods from me &amp; my ſubiects. Of the which exceſſe (as I am credibly informed and fully perſwaded) the <hi>Venetians</hi> haue bene the cauſe &amp; motiue: by whoſe inſtigation &amp; enticement, thou haſt bene pricked forward &amp; incited againſt vs. By their practiſes &amp; flatteries haſt thou bene drawen on to make warre vpon me, openly ſhewing thy ſelfe to be a breaker of thy promiſes, &amp; the violatour of the rightes &amp; the law of Nations. Wherefore I neither do, nor will attribute any or very litle fault &amp; blame vnto thee, conſidering the cauſe of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minie rather then the ignominy it ſelfe: but I do impute the whole offence vnto them who haue bene alwaies my ſworn &amp; profeſſed enemies.

And yet for my part I repute it no iniurie: nay I can be content that thou go forward in doing the like, and that thou doe continue and holde on ſtill thy courſes and inuaſions, if ſo be thou thinke it meete and conuenient.

And whereas in regard of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular loue and good opinion which he had of him, he did impute the whole fault of the renuing of the warre to no other then to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> he did wrongfully ſlander them, for that there was not any likelihood or probability, that they ſhould go about to ſeduce him and to make them enemies: ſeeing that the <hi>Venetian</hi> common weale is of ſufficient puiſſance by themſelues alone whenſoeuer they ſee cauſe, not onely to compare and contend with him marmes, but alſo to ſurmount and excell him. And as touching the perſwaſions which he vſed vnto him, to leaue their friendſhippe, he had litle reaſon to perſwade him to that matter, ſeeing himſelfe knew very well, that the amitie betwene them was verie ancient and of long continuance: whereof it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med he had ſmall or no regard, when notwithſtanding the ſame, he had not forborne to waſte and deſtroy their country &amp; poſſeſſions in <hi>Morea,</hi> but had chaſed them in a manner cleane out of all, to the great preiudice and contempt of the accord and peace betwene them. As for thoſe vaine magnificall titles of Emperour of the Orient and Occident, in which he ſeemed ſo to glorie and boaſt himſelfe: herecounted vnto him infinite Prouinces and Realmes, who had ſcarce as yet heard of the bare name of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> &amp; put the caſe (which God defend) that all were brought vnder the yoke of his ſubiection, and that his Dominions did extend euen to the maine Ocean: yet ought not he for all that to be ſo puffed vp in glorie, and to exalt himſelfe about others: but he was rather to looke into the reuolution and inconſtancie of worldly things: and to take an example by the <hi>Aſsirians</hi> who were once the Monarches of the whole world, and by the <hi>Medes,</hi> the <hi>Perſians,</hi> the <hi>Greekes,</hi> and laſt of all the <hi>Romanes,</hi> yea by <hi>Tamberlain</hi> himſelfe, who was euen of late yeares the proud and mightie King of the <hi>Tartarians,</hi> the ſcourge of the race of <hi>Ottoman,</hi> &amp; the terror of nations: all which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding were now conſumed and extinguiſhed by the extinguiſher of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, Empires and Nations, euen the finger of the great God: That he therefore ought to acknowledge himſelfe to be but an earthly mortall creature, and the vaſſall and ſlaue of fortune: and that he was not to put his truſt &amp; confidence in his innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable legions &amp; huge armies: the which oftentimes (as is to be ſeene by the teſtimony of many hiſtories) are confounded and ouerthrowen by thoſe which are much leſſer and farre inferior vnto them: and that therefore neither he, nor any other Chieftaine howe great and fortunate ſoeuer, could iuſtly merit any true praiſe or commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: till ſuch time as he ſhould ſee himſelfe euen entred into his triumph. That in vaine he did ſolicit him to renue the friendſhip and alliance betweene them, ſo notably was his faith ſuſpected vnto him, &amp; ſo odious was his acquaintance. Laſt of all hauing

            <p>This then was the reply which the Prince of <hi>Epire,</hi> made to the importunate and<note place="margin">Letters from Pope Pius the ſecond to Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg.</note> fallacious letters of the great Turke: the which was no ſooner diſpatched, and ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but that he receiued letters from the Pope, aduertiſing him that he would ſhortly remoue from the city of <hi>Rome,</hi> accompanied with infinite forces which had taken the <hi>Croyſado</hi> againſt the <hi>Ottoman,</hi> and that from thence paſſing to <hi>Ancona,</hi> and ſo embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himſelf to the ſea, he ment to paſſe into <hi>Epire,</hi> where he was determined to make the Archbiſhop of <hi>Duraz, Paul Angell</hi> a Cardinall, and then to crowne <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> king of <hi>Epire</hi> and <hi>Albany,</hi> and to commit the abſolute authority of the Chriſtian army to his charge and conduct: to the intent that all their forces being vnited, he might purſue the war againſt the Infidell, which all the Chriſtians in common had vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againſt him.

I ſee that all Chriſtendomr with their Pope (as they tearme him) haue conſpired againſt vs: I ſee that all their Kings and Potentates haue combined them ſelues together againſt our Empire and eſtate: they haue betaken

them to armes on all ſides, to depriue vs of <hi>Europe</hi> their auncient patrimony: ſo did <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamemnon</hi> in <hi>Homer,</hi> one day determine to ouerthrow the wals of <hi>Troy</hi> before ſun-ſet, but <hi>Iupiter</hi> turned his cies another way, and derided the vowes of that fooliſh Prince: the like (I doubt not) will happen to the fond preſumption of the Chriſtians, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten to purchaſe vnto themſelues ſome ſingular and glorious renowme vpon vs, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it very difficult, but indeed they will enlarge and amplifie your triumphes and your Empire: I know it well, and I dare promiſe you as much vpon my honor. For (not to ſpeake of the commodities of places, of victuals, munitions, and ſuch like helpes: in which the ſtrength and ſuccour of the wars, doth conſiſt very much) and whereof the Chriſtians will haue great ſcarſity, and we ſhall haue plenty, I can aſſure you that the Empire and dominion of the whole world is promiſed vnto vs by the celeſtiall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as I haue learned by the courſe of the ſtars, and the ſcience of Aſtrology, by which I haue reaped wonderfull profit, and whoſoeuer hath the perfect knowledge thereof, cannot poſſibly erre nor be deceiued. For without all doubt, the whole frame of this world here below, is ruled and gouerned by the ſuperiour motions of the ſtarres and planets. Moreouer you ſhall not want ſtore of reſolute &amp; obedient ſouldiers, you ſhall haue ready at hand diuerſe great and puiſſant armies, you ſhall haue infinit troups and bands of men, and you ſhall haue plenty of armes, horſes, engines: &amp; in briefe, all kinds of neceſſary and needfull prouiſions, whereby the victory may be purchaſed &amp; gotten with eaſe and facility. Only haue you a regard for your parts, that you be well aduiſed in all your councels, that you bring with you coragious hearts and ſtout ſtomackes, and that your hands be prompt and valorous. This is it (my good ſouldiers) that muſt purchaſe you, either aſſured liberty or perpetuall ſeruitude: this is that knot and band of the whole matter, this is it wherein conſiſteth the preſeruation of your countrey, of your Empire, of your children, of your goods, and poſſeſſions: to this doth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perill, and the common ruine of your ſelues and all yours, both inuite you, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh you, yea and conſtraine you: and all of you are equally &amp; alike ſummoned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, by the equall hazard and danger of this war. Hereunto alſo ought the variable euents and alteration of great things to ſpur and pricke you forward, the which in all humaine actions are oftentimes in great perill, and ſubiect to notable dangers, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of prompt and ready deliberation, and for want of good and ſettled reſolution.</q>

            <p>This oration of the Turkiſh Emperor, was generally approued by all the aſsiſtants, and it wrought in them with ſuch efficacy, that all of them confirmed the deuotion of their fidelity and obeiſaunce, with a new and ſolemne oth, promiſing without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of perils, paines or trauell, to expoſe their liues and vttermoſt meanes for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> name and Empire, and for the amplifying of his crowne and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.

            <p>Let vs leaue <hi>Mahomet</hi> for a while, beating his braine and bending all his thoughts and imaginations, to prouide fit and neceſſary preparation for the generall warre of the Chriſtians, and let vs returne to our religious Prince <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> who being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with the ſpoiles of the Turkes, was now retired into his campe, where he was no ſooner arriued, but that it was told him, that <hi>Seremet</hi> did approach and was neare at hand, one of the braueſt Captaines that the <hi>Sultan</hi> had, and that with a ſtrong and mighty army, he was come vpon the confines of <hi>Thrace</hi> and <hi>Macedony:</hi> and <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg</hi> being no leſſe forward then he was alwaies wont, tooke the field three hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore day, being determined to fight with him if it were poſſible.

For it was then the vigill of the Aſſumption of the bleſſed Virgin the mother of our Sauiour, vppon which day, as men religiouſly diſpoſed, they did abſtaine from eating of any fleſhmeats. Thus making mery amongſt themſelues, they ſaid by way of mirth, that their prince was the Apoſtle of him who had fed the Iewes with fiue loaues and<note place="margin">Saying of the ſouldiers E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirots of Scanderbeg.</note> two fiſhes.

For although they were yet fierce and glorious through their victory lately gotten againſt <hi>Seremet,</hi> yet vpon the hearing of this newes, they were as men amaſed and confounded, and as if they had bene ſtriken with thunder and lightning from Heauen, ſo infinitly did they grieue for that this enterprize and expedition againſt the Turkes was broken off, but <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> carying a courage, and a mind pliable to all the aſſaults and croſſes of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, did not in any ſort bewray himſelfe to be grieued or diſcomforted, neither did he ſhew any alteration for this vnfortunate and vnhappy chaunce, but with a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full countenance, nothing chaunged nor troubled, he comforted his friends and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liars with theſe ſpeeches and perſwaſions.</p>

For though in the eie of man the may ſeeme good and profitable, yet in the ſight and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret knowledge of his diuine Maieſty, he knoweth them to be otherwiſe: and there be many things which vnto vs appeare to be profitable and beneficiall, but his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome foreſeeth that they will greatly preiudice vs. For example: there is no city ſo populous, there is no nation ſo puiſſant, but if they want enemies abroade, they are ſure to finde ſome euen at home amongſt them ſelues: and you ſhall neuer ſee any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſo ſtrong and luſty, but if there be no externall cauſe to moleſt or grieue them, yet they will at one time or another be oppreſſed and ouerborne by their owne proper forces, by reaſon of ſome inward contrariety.

to haue kept them in feare and awe, they had not then bene conſumed by inteſtine ciuill warres within themſelues, they had not then turned their ſwordes againſt their owne throates, and their Empire peraduenture had bene ſtanding euen till this day. For the feare of a forreine and outward foe (which as ſome ſay, is a ſure gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, and a moſt ſtreight and perfect bond of amitie and concorde) had preſerued<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> and ſtill mainteined them in ſafetie. The like may we ſay perhappes of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and of the nations profeſsing the faith of Chriſt: for if we were exempted from an externall and forreine enemies, and had not an aduerſatie elſewhere to keepe vs in awe, conſidering our impietie and ambition, our rancours and diuiſions paſt all hope of reconciliation, and the bloudy ſtreames of troubles and tumults nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from time to time within the body of the common weale of Chriſtendome, do you not thinke that we ſhould finde a hundreth times more diſaduantage and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe by our owne enmities and diſſentions, then by the violence of our outward enemies? Aſſure your ſelues we had long ere this time bene conſumed and worne out by the furie and outrage of our owne proper armes. I conclude therefore, that it is not happened altogether for the worſt, that this voyage is diſcontinued and broken off: for it was greatly to be feared, that when we had once chaſed away this greeuous and bloudy enemie farre from vs, leaſt that then we would haue kindled ſome fire within out owne houſes, which ſhould haue proued more bloudy and fatall vnto vs. Howbeit it is not to be doubted, and we may hold it for a certain and infallible truth,<note place="margin">Empire of the Turkes is not durable.</note> that the Empire of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> cannot continue long but that it muſt needes decay and periſh, if at leaſt wiſe this may be called or termed an Empire, which is but a waſt and ſolitarie deſert of Barbariſme depriued of all light of true doctrine, being without lawes, without iudgements, without any good order and policie, and euen in thoſe parts, eſpecially where as once, the artes, &amp; ſciences, the true and perfect diſcipline, the moſt famous Churches with many other orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts were moſt glorious &amp; floriſhing: as we ſee it now come to paſſe in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and a great part of Europe ſubdued by the armes and violence of the Turkes. And albeit <hi>Daniell</hi> in his Prophecies diſtinguiſhing the fortune and vertue of euery Empire, hath deſcribed all of them: namely that in this old and declining age of the world, there ſhalbe more confuſions then haue bene in times paſt: and that God notwithſtanding (as long as mankinde ſhall endure vpon the face of the earth) will preſerue ſome Kingdomes and Empires: which as the end of the world doth more and more approch; ſo ſhall they grow more faint and feeble: and yet neuertheleſſe; that there ſhould ariſe a certaine Barbarous nation of a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full puiſſance, named in the diuine Prophecies <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog:</hi> howbeit let vs not be troubled at the power and puiſſance of the Turkes, which by manifeſt and aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent teſtimonies is condemned and reiected of God, as being raiſed and encreaſed by deceiptfull and vnlawfull meanes, and plunged in all kindes of vices, filthineſſe, and wickedneſſe. And let vs not make any doubt of the promiſes and predictions left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs by the voyce of the ſonne of God: but let vs fully aſſure our ſelues, that the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the Empire is not nor ſhall not fall into the handes of ſo Barbarous and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable tyrannie, which vomiteth forth blaſphemies againſt Chriſt the Sauiour of the<note place="margin">Dignitie of the true Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire where it is to be ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</note> world, and aboliſheth all honeſt and eiuill policies, but let vs rather aſſure our ſelues, that there onely and not elſewhere the ſacred maieſtie of the Empire both is and ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be continued, where the true Religion is mainteined and obſerued, where the diuine lawes, and other ciuill lawes and good ordinaunces deriued out of them do rule and beare ſway, where the lawfull adminiſtration of iuſtice is vpheld in our ſtrength and vigour, where good men are rewarded, and offenders are puniſhed: laſt of all where the honeſt and godly aſſemblies and ſocieties of good men, are preſerued and

            <p>Thus did <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> comfort and encourage his people, that they might not be diſmayed for the breaking vp and diſperſing of the Chriſtian armie.

This Chieftaine was no leſſe prompt and hardy in executing any thing with his hand, then he was of an expert and aduiſed iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the politicke handling of martiall affaires: for he was a man that had bene long practiſed in armes, and had giuen many proofes of his ſufficiencie and valour vnder <hi>Mahomet,</hi> eſpecially at the taking of <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> where he was the firſt<note place="margin">Ballaban his birth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Aga, the place of a Colonell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt the Turkes.</note> man that mounted vpon the wall, and entred into the Citie.

Touching the ſtature of his bodie, he was not very tall, but of a middle ſize: but he was of a notable quicke and ready wit, his minde was extremely great and haughtie, beſides that he was very reſolute and couragious, fearing nothing. So as it may well be ſayd of him, as <hi>Homer</hi> wrote of <hi>Tydeus.</hi>

               <q>wealthie, then to vſe the ſeruice of a great number of ſouldiours: and many times alſo he vſed theſe ſpeeches, that that Captaine which with ten or twelue thouſand men at the moſt knew not how to beate his enemie, would hardly be able to doe any honorable exploit with greater forces. For he affirmed that the multitude of troupes, and the exceſsiue numbers of ſouldiours had many times cauſed con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fuſion, and had bene the diſturbance,</q> and an hinderance to the victorie. Now the Infidell as hath bene ſayd, had fiften thouſand horſe, and three hundred foote. The <hi>Scanderbegians</hi> were encamped at the one end of a pleaſaunt valley, which they of the countrey call <hi>Valcala,</hi> which being of a goodly breadth, it was more long then<note place="margin">The valley of Valcala.</note> large. The Barbarians had ſeized vppon the other end of the valley, neare to a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine which lay at the end of <hi>Valcala,</hi> the entry whereof was very ſtraight &amp; narrow, and the enemy hauing both the mountaine and the paſſage in their power and puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance,<note place="margin">Ambuſcado layd by Balla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the entry of Valcala.</note> had laied there an ambuſcado, to the intent that the fight being begunne, and the Chriſtians hauing the better, if they did purſue the victory, and did enter within the ſtreight of that narrow paſſage to get to the ſacking of their Campe, they ſhould be encloſed in the middeſt of their enemies, lying there in the ambuſhment, and by that meanes ſhould be at their mercy and diſcretion. The king of <hi>Epire</hi> who was encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped at the other end of the valley, forſeeing well that this their neare neighbourhood to their enemies, could not be parted without talking nearer together, and for that his forces were the weakeſt, he iudged it needfull for him to ſeeke ſome aduantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and therefore he vſed theſe ſpeeches vnto his ſouldiers.</p>
            <p>My good friends and companions, I ſee well that it behoueth vs this day aſmuch<note place="margin">Oration of Scanderbeg to his ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours before the battell of Valcala.</note>

Notwithſtanding, this you muſt marke: that as ſoone as he ſeeth vs departing hence, he will imagine (becauſe we are ſo few, that we meane to flie:) and therefore it is to bethought, that he will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly charge vs with all poſsible violence at our backes, which if he doe, then do you receiue him valiantly: and after you haue a litle ſhifted your place and fained a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traite, ſodainely do you turne head, and with a round and braue charge, do you beare

in vpon them with all your ſtrength, and (as your cuſtome is) breake and diſorder them: in ſo doing I doubt not, but you ſhall haue them at your diſcretion. But take heede (my good ſouldiers) I pray you, and be you well aduiſed when you haue put them to flight, and that you haue them in chaſe, and do follow them in execution vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them: takeheed, I ſay, that you enter not in any caſe within the mouth of the ſtraight of <hi>Valcala:</hi> but ſtopping your courſe paſſe no further forwardes. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that paſſage I knowe there are certaine ſquadrons of the enemie layed to entrappe vs: I knowe it well, I am well acquainted both with the place, and the pollicies of the Barbarians: if you once enter in, you will neuer get out againe. Let it ſuffiſe you therefore (my friends) to purſue the victorie euen to the entrie of that place and no further.</q>

            <p>As ſoone as he had thus ſpoken, he eſpied <hi>Ballaban</hi> marching on directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes<note place="margin">The battell of Valcala be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Balla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg.</note> him: whereupon he ſent a certaine number of light horſemen to ſeize vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon that hill which he had choſen for the lodging of his armie: and immediatly he followed after them with the bodie of his troupes, making as though he meant to haue made a retrait: the which the Turkes perceauing and beleeuing verelie, that they had bene in a true and playne flight, they galloped after them without any good order, and with great furie they held on their courſe the length of all the valley. Then did the <hi>Epyrots</hi> begin to beare vppe cloſe together, and being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing aſtoniſhed with the clamours or violent charge of the Turkes, they turned about, and with a hardie reſolution they receaued them to the ſhocke, and ſo ioyned with them in combat. Then began the fight to grow moſt ſharpe, cruell, and blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and many fell both of the one ſide and the other, and the victorie reſted for a long time doubtfull and vncertaine. In fine the <hi>Albanois</hi> fought with ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and ſettled reſolution and obſtinacie againſt the Infidelles, being out of order<note place="margin">Victorie of Scanderbeg a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Balla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban and the Turkes.</note> and in ſome confuſion, that they got the aduantage, killing and beating them downe on all partes and draue them backe euen to the ſtreightes of <hi>Valcala,</hi> and there they tooke breath and made a ſtand, excepting eight onely of the Chriſtian armie (each of whom without all doubt, was worthie to haue had the abſolute commaunde of a good and great armie.) Theſe being tranſported with the furie of the fight, and the heate of armes, and forgetting the expreſſe commaundement of their Generall, but being ſpurred forward with an eager deſire of following the chaſe vpon the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and with a mortall hatred againſt <hi>Ballaban,</hi> were drawen on into the ambuſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do of the Infidels, &amp; did very vnaduiſedly entangle themſelues within theſe ſtreights, which by meanes of this vnhappie accident were, I dare ſay, as famous by the loſſe<note place="margin">Forkes of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyum.

For as all of them were of ſingular accompt and eſtimation, both for their corporal ſtrength and vigour, for the magnanimitie of their courages, and for their excellent skill and knowledge in armes and the ſcience mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie: ſo were they no leſſe fearfull and terrible to the <hi>Mahometans.</hi> In ſo much that when their Monarke the <hi>Ottoman</hi> heard, that they were taken, &amp; brought vnto him aliue, he conceiued ſuch an exceeding and extreme ioy thereby, that he cried out aloft, and with a lowd voyce vttered theſe words.</p>
            <p>Now do I know for a truth and certainty, now may I well &amp; iuſtly ſay, that <q>

            </p>
            <p>Thus after he had highly commended and exalted <hi>Ballaban,</hi> he ſent vnto him a great quantitie of gold and ſiluer and other giftes, with a commiſſion to reſtore his bands with newe ſupplies, and to purſue the warre againſt <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi> Who in this<note place="margin">Ambaſſade ſent by Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet for the raunſome of Moſes and his other Nobles.

But the felonious tyraunt, being caried away with rage and furie, made no account of this Ambaſſage: but after all kindes of ignominie and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous crueltie vſed and practiſed vpon them, he cauſed them to be flayed aliue by little and little for fifteene dayes together: during the which they yeelded vp their<note place="margin">Death of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and other priſoners by the tyrannie of Mahomet.</note> conſtant and glorious ſoules vnto God, and did augment (as it is to be beleeued) the happie companie of the Martyrs in Paradiſe. The abhominable crueltie of this torment, made the ignominie of the Chriſtians more notable and notorious: and all the armie of the <hi>Albanians</hi> did infinitely bewayle and grieue at their miſerable ende: and the countrey of <hi>Albanie</hi> did feele much more griefe and ſorow through the want of their deare and beloued citizens, then they conceiued ioye for the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie had againſt their enemies: neither was the ſorrowe and lamentation leſſe which was made generally and in publicke, then that which was ſeene particularly and in priuate. For many (as the report goeth) did chaunge their habit and their garments, and many alſo did let the haire of their heads and beards to growe at length, in token that they mourned, and grieuouſly lamented for this great and lamentable loſſe of theſe excellent and heroycall perſons. The king him ſelfe was no leſſe grieued in

Neuertheleſſe bearing a minde hardened againſt all the aſſaultes and encombraunces of fortune, he preſently inuaded and ouercame the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies countrey, ſhewing him ſelfe more deſirous of reuenge then of bootie and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, and he turned all things vpſide downe not leauing any thing in whole and good eſtate which either the ſword or the fire could poſsibly waſt, deſtroy and conſume.</p>
            <p>Certaine dayes were ſpent in theſe courſes, and actes of hoſtility, during the which,<note place="margin">Ballaban his ſecond iourney againſt Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg with 18000. Turks.</note> 
               <hi>Ballaban</hi> by vertue of his commiſsion renued for the warre of <hi>Albanie,</hi> had made and finiſhed the encreaſe and ſupplie of his companies to the auncient number of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand men on horſe backe, and three thouſand footemen, which done he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Achaia</hi> vpon the frontiers of <hi>Macedonie,</hi> and there did he endeuour by his wonted ſleightes and his ordinarie diſguiſed ſhewes of cunning to reconcile him ſelfe vnto <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> with new preſentes and honeſt offers of ſeruice and amitie. In the ende ſeeing that he had but a cold ſuite, and that his guile and diſsimulation was too well knowen, as alſo that he had leſſe hope and power to attaine to the ende of his deſires by playne and open armes, he employed therefore all his wittes and deuiſes to more ſecret and cloſe attemptes, that by ſome more ſhort and more ready courſe he might ouer-reach and entrappe him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> being accompanied with 4000. horſe, and fiue and twentie hundreth footemen, he pitched his tents at <hi>Oronichea</hi> in the vpper <hi>Dibria,</hi> and vpon all parts and<note place="margin">Ballaban his exploit againſt Scanderbeg whom he thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth to ſurpriſe in his Campe.</note> paſſages of his Campe, he had placed very conueniently both ſentinels and ſcoutes.

Neuertheleſſe the conflict was long and mortall betweene them, eſpecially on the part of the <hi>Epirots,</hi> both becauſe that many of them had not yet
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:13368:235"/>
put themſelues in rancke within their battell, as alſo by reaſon of the great number of their enemies: but in the ende finding the Infidels to be better furniſhed and armed with cordes and chaynes to binde the Chriſtians, then with hardie and obſtinate hearts to put them to vtterance: and perceiuing that they fought but faintly, they did<note place="margin">Victorie of Scanderbeg the ſecond time againſt Balla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban and the Turkes.</note> preſſe vppon them ſo violently, that being not able to endure them any longer, they made them to turne their backes and to betake themſelues to flight. Whereupon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloſely purſued and liuely followed by the Chriſtians, they were handled ſo rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they were not able to recouer their trenches, but were enforced to abandon their campe to the pillage of their enemies. The maſſacre and the bootie alſo was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable. <hi>Ballaban</hi> himſelfe with a very ſmall traine, without enſignes, without bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage did carrie the newes of his owne diſcomfiture. <hi>Mahomet</hi> receiued him, but with ſoure lookes, and he was long in a doubt and perplexitie, whether he ſhould employ anie other Chieftaine in this warre, ſeeing that ſo ſmall a handfull of men (as he obiected vnto him) had had the power to ouercome him ſo ſhamefully.</p>
            <p>After diuerſe conſultations, he concluded in the ende once againe to employ him againſt the <hi>Albanois,</hi> and to ſend him backe into <hi>Epyre,</hi> many cauſes and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vrging him thereunto. Firſt of all, he knew him to be a mortall enemy to <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg:</hi> beſides he was an <hi>Epyrot</hi> borne, and he was very well practiſed and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with all the places and paſſages of the countrie which were moſt fit and apt for ambuſcadoes. Beſides amongſt ſo many thouſands of excellent Knightes and men of command vnder the obeiſance of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, he knew not any one ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie and ſufficient as him alone. Moreouer knowing the diſpoſition of all men, and how inſatiably couetous the minde of man is of honour and authoritie, he promiſed him the crowne of <hi>Epyre,</hi> in caſe he could find the meanes to make <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> away and to deſtroy him. Now <hi>Ballaban</hi> being a man of notable reſolution, and withall ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deſirous to make his life glorious in the world, which otherwiſe was but ignoble and ſubiect to vncertaintie, he thought nothing impoſſible which might purchaſe him honour and eſtimation: and therfore albeit he had bene twice beaten by the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banois,</hi> yet he accepted this commiſſion very willingly, and departed from <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi>

For bearing vp cloſe and ſtreight to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they did ſo rudely preſſe vppon their enemies, terrifying and fearing them with their incredible brauerie and couragiouſneſſe, that they enforced them to giue ground, themſelues not yeelding nor recuiling, ſo much as one foote backewardes, as men that were led on with diſpaire and reſolution, and whoſe eyes were cloſed vp againſt all perils whatſoeuer. <hi>Ballaban</hi> who had more then once made proofe of the rude entertainement of the <hi>Albanois,</hi> and knew well what belonged therunto, did continue the fight with ſingular prudence and dexteritie, laboring with great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding care and trauell to preuent and eſchew all perils and inconueniences. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guarded with a ſtrong troupe of horſe, he held firme in the forefront of the battell, comforting &amp; cheering vp thoſe which were wearied, and ſtill ſupplying with freſh men the places of thoſe which were wounded: and thus being intentiue with a proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent eye and regard to all partes, he made no ſpare of his perſon in diſcharging the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoire and dutie both of an excellent Captaine, and a moſt tall ſouldier. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> likewiſe whereſoeuer he ſaw any of his ſquadrons to wauer, did readily ſuccour and relieue them, &amp; did continually reſtore the fight: and if it happened at any time that his people did begin to grow weary, or to haue the worſt of the fight, the would ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily make from one part to another, and he would on all ſides ſuſtaine the hazard of the battell, he would thruſt in amongſt the thickeſt of his enemies, &amp; by his preſence would withſtand the fury &amp; tempeſt of their attempts. So that on what ſide ſoeuer the Barbarians turned themſelues, ſtill did they meete &amp; encounter with the fury of <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg,</hi> then the which nothing could preſent it ſelfe more terrible in their ſight, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could haue happened more to their diſcouragement: &amp; wherſoeuer he became he ſtill drew after him an aſſured victorie, inſomuch, that both the enemy &amp; the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banois</hi> did openly confeſſe &amp; affirme with one generall conſent &amp; voice, that <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg</hi> was the beſt ſouldier &amp; braueſt warrior in the world. As he was thus gotten in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the thickeſt of the Infidels, doing wonderfull deeds of armes in killing al that came in his way, it happened that his horſe being mortally wounded did ſtumble at
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:13368:236"/>
a great trunke or roote of a tree couched cloſe by the ground, ſo that they fell both<note place="margin">Scanderbeg in danger of his life.</note> horſe and man together. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> lying vnder his horſe was ſo ſore cruſhed with the fall, and ſo grieuouſly hurt in one of his ſhoulders, that he lay a while as one in a ſwound. The Turks thought verily he had bene dead, and therfore aduancing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in a great troupe together, they came flocking about him, and beganne to light on foote, that they might haue cut off his head. But <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> his men at armes ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in furiouſly, and breaking thorough the preſſe, did couer him with their bodies and their ſhields till ſuch time as being come againe to himſelfe, and hauing recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his weapons, he was mounted againe vpon a freſh horſe. Therupon the vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the griefe paſt, and his ſpirits newly gathered, made him to enter againe into the middeſt of the battell with greater fury and fiercenes then before, inſomuch that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king way on all ſides with the edge of his ſword amongſt the Infidels, he ſeemed not much vnlike to a raging tempeſt which falling in a field of corne, beateth it al down, and preſſeth it euen with the ground: ſo the King of <hi>Albany</hi> making a great ſlaughter and butchery amongſt the Turkes, encountred at length with one that was a man of principal account and chiefeſt regard in all their armie, whoſe name was <hi>Sulyman,</hi> and him did he ouerthrow dead vpon the place. This act gaue him the whole aduantage of the field, which till that time was vncertaine and equally ballanced betweene both parties. But euen at that inſtant ſo ſudden &amp; ſtrange a feare did ſurpriſe the barbarians, that their force &amp; courage began to faile them all at once: and they were not able any longer to endure the violence of the Chriſtians, who had vſually bene accuſtomed to beate &amp; maſter them. Wherfore in this their generall aſtoniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, they were ſo liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; roundly preſſed, and ſo hardly followed, that they were conſtrained to turne their backes, &amp; to flie with might &amp; maine for the ſafegard of their liues. But the flight was more pernicious vnto them then the fight: for all of them in a manner remained dead<note place="margin">Victorie of Scanderbeg the third time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Balla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban and the Turkes.</note> in the fields of <hi>Dibria,</hi> which ſeemed to be fattened with the bloud of the Infidels, by reaſon that the vanquiſhers did ſo egerly follow &amp; purſue them, that they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer leaue nor giue ouer the chaſe as long as they fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d any one with his weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in his hand. I ſhould haue enough to doe, if I ſhould tell you how notable a bootie, &amp; what great riches were found in the tents and campe of the Paynims; all which was libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally graunted to the ſouldiers, to comfort them for the hardneſſe and difficultie of their labours, and to aſſwage the griefe and ſorrow of their hearts conceiued for the loſſe of their fellowes and companions, of whom there were ſlaine in this battell to the number of three hundred, beſides infinite of them ſore wounded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> after this notable and famous iourney, found himſelfe ſo payned in his ſhoulder and in his arme, that he was compelled in a manner to keepe houſe for three whole monethes together. <hi>Ballaban</hi> who had ſaued himſelfe by the benefite of his<note place="margin">Mahomet highly diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with Balla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban for the loſſe of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</note> ſpurres, and had gotten within <hi>Alchria,</hi> departed from thence within a while after to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where being come with a very ſmall traine, he had but bad wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of his Prince, who entertained him with a very angry and frowning counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. He reproched him continually with this foule and grieuous ouerthrow, and he demaunded of him the liues of ſo many braue ſouldiers, and the flower of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gallant youthes which (as he ſaid) were betraied &amp; wilfully lead to the butcherie, by his folly and raſhneſſe. But the wylie and cunning gallant, by a long and artificiall Oration found the meanes to appeaſe and mitigate the wrath and anger of the <hi>Sultan:</hi>

And thus did he excuſe himſelfe as finely as he could. So well could he handle the matter by his ſmooth and fayre ſpeeches, that he made the <hi>Sultan</hi> to giue him the hearing of anie thing.

Theſe troupes being nowe aſſembled together, and parted betweene them, <hi>Ballaban</hi> directed his compartner to take his way all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeſt the ſeacoaſtes, and ſo croſſing ouer <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Theſſaly</hi> to enter into <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre:</hi> and he charged him expreſſely, that in any caſe he ſhould not diſcouer himſelfe, or make any attempt againſt the enemie, till ſuch time as he perceiued <hi>Ballaban</hi> him<note place="margin">Ballaban his fourth iourney againſt Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg with 28000.

            <p>Let vs now turne our ſpeech to the Generall of the Chriſtians, and let vs ſee a litle with what diligence, and with what preparations, he prouided to feaſt theſe his gueſtes, who had bidden themſelues in ſo great a companie, without being inuited by him. For you muſt vnderſtand, that <hi>Arnauth</hi> who went the other way, had with him alſo ſixteene thouſand horſe at the leaſt. <hi>Ballaban</hi> had no ſooner taken the fielde, but that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> had as ſpeedie intelligence of his comming both by letters writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to him of purpoſe, as alſo by his eſpyals, of whom he kept a good number conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually diſperſed in all parts of the Turke his country, and euen within the cabinet (if I may ſo ſpeake) of the tyrant: by occaſion whereof he cauſed a ſpeedy leauy to be made of eight thouſand horſe, and fourethouſand footmen, with as great ſilence and ſecrecie as was poſſible, &amp; with them he held himſelfe in a readineſſe, being fully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared both in courage and in armes to receiue the Barbarian. Who being at length arriued within the frontiers of <hi>Epyre,</hi> the <hi>Albanian</hi> Prince determined to go &amp; viſite him, purpoſing to make an end of that matter, and to trie his fortune firſt with him, before that <hi>Arnauth</hi> ſhould be able to come and ioine with him, for feare leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſayled all at one time with two ſo puiſſant enemies, he ſhould not be able to make head againſt them, and ſo might his enemies haue their deſire of him. And without all doubt I doe not thinke that it would haue fallen out any otherwiſe, if the plot laid by the Paynim had ſorted to his effect. But the diuine prouidence (which gouerneth and ruleth all things according to his owne will and pleaſure) had a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall care to the affaires of the Chriſtians and of <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi> And he would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that he which of ſo ardent a zeale, and ſo ſincere and entire an affection did daily expoſe and aduenture his life, and did inceſſantly labor &amp; trauell for the preſeruation of the Catholike faith, ſhold ſo ignominiouſly &amp; traiterouſly be ſurpriſed, vanquiſhed or oppreſſed. <hi>Ballaban</hi> therefore hauing paſſed ouer <hi>Thrace</hi> and <hi>Macedonie,</hi> was now<note place="margin">Ballaban en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped at the plaine of Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cala.</note> encamped in the plaine of <hi>Valcala:</hi> wherefore <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> hauing knowledge, by the fauour and benefite of the darke, he cauſed his troupes to march in great ſecrecie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly towardes him, and ſent before him three ſouldiers (ſuch as he thought moſt aduiſed and beſt accuſtomed to that office) to diſcouer and take a viewe of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies campe, and to obſerue their countenance, with an expreſſe commaundement that aſſoone as they had ſeene and conſidered all things, they ſhould not faile to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto him preſently, and to make report vnto him what they had learned. One of theſe three ſouldiers (as ſome ſay) was of kinne to <hi>Ballaban,</hi> or at leaſtwiſe was before corrupted. And he had wonne his companions likewiſe promiſing them in the behalfe of <hi>Ballaban</hi> great ſummes of golde and ſiluer: the which we ſee doth <q>daily worke miracles in the mindes of mortall men, eſpecially ſuch as are greedily ſet<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> vpon the deſire of worldly riches.</q> Theſe three then went on directly to the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Treaſon of cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine ſouldiers ſeruing vnder Scanderbeg.</note> and reuealed vnto him all the ſecret counſels and enterpriſes of <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Epyre</hi> hauing his thoughtes continually vppon his ſcoutes did for
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:13368:238"/>
a while expect and looke for them: but ſeeing that they ſtayed ouer long and came not againe, he was in a doubt leaſt ſome miſaduenture had befallen them, and that they had beene intercepted by the enemie. Himſelfe therefore (as he was alwayes prompt and venturous in all militarie actions) would needs goe and ſee what ſhould be the cauſe of their ſtay, taking with him in his companie onely fiue ſouldiers and no more, to the intent he might take a view, and be informed of the eſtate of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and heare ſome newes alſo of his owne people. But <hi>Ballaban</hi> (who to his owne coſt was paſſing well acquainted and experienced with the cunning and politique draughts of his enemie) miſdoubting ſome ſuch matter, thought that he would beat him at his owne weapons, and therefore he vſed this counterpolicie in hope to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach him. He made choiſe of certaine ſtout and very hardie men, all excellently well mounted on horſebacke, and with them did he beſet a certaine paſſage, by which he<note place="margin">Ambuſhment dreſſed by Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laban to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg.</note> ſuſpected that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> himſelfe would come to take a view of his campe, and the demeanour of his armie: and he was not any thing deceiued in his imagination. For behold <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> was now come to the place of this ambuſhment, but yet before he would proceede any further, he cauſed (according to his wonted cuſtome) one of his ſouldiers to goe before him, who ſoone diſcouered the daunger of the Turkes which lay there ambuſhed. The Infidels ſeeing themſelues bewrayed, iſſued out vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him with great furie, and after ſome reſiſtance made, conſtrayned him to flie. In his flight he put himſelfe into a certaine wood or thicket, which came next to hand,<note place="margin">Scanderbeg in great danger of his life, eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhment of Ballaban.</note> and which lay on the other ſide of the mountaine, which encloſeth the plaine of <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cala,</hi> where by ill happe he chaunced vpon a great tree, which being withered with age, was fallen downe and lay croſſe the path by which he was to paſſe. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> ſetting ſpurres to his horſe made him to leape roundly ouer, the like did one of his ſouldiers which followed him: but his companions not being able to doe the like, and perceiuing that their laſt refuge, &amp; their only hope to ſaue their liues conſiſted in their armes: couching the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues cloſe, they gaue in valiantly amongſt their enemies, &amp; hauing both ſlain &amp; hurt ſome of them, they yeelded vp their liues as became men of valure and reſolution. One of the Barbarians following hard after <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> leapt likewiſe ouer the trunke of the tree, and gathered very cloſe and neere vppon him: <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> caſting his eye about, and ſeeing one onely to followe him, made backe directly towards him, and quickly ouerthrew him dead to the ground: the reſt being not willing to purſue him any farther, were content to let him goe and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part quietly. After this faire and happy eſcape, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> being returned to his campe neere <hi>Petralba</hi> about fifteene miles from the enemie, made readie his ſquadrons for to march againſt the Infidels. At that time more then euer did the Prince of <hi>Albanie</hi> employ all his ſenſes to encourage and animate his men with good words, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good meanes to doe their deuoire againſt their enemies. He offered them giftes and large rewards: he inuited and importuned them with prayers and earneſt intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties both in generall and in particular to take ſuch things at his hande whereof they ſtood in any neede, were it either for themſelues or for their horſes. As the King was very bountifull to offer them freely of his owne, ſo aſſure your ſelues, that the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ſhewed their wonderfull modeſty, and did (as it were) conted with him in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and courteſie, not taking any thing but in ſuch meaſurable and modeſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as might ſerue onely for the preſent neede and neceſſitie. Then the <hi>Albanois</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing<note place="margin">Scanderbeg marcheth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Balla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban.</note> taken ſome repaſt, began to march towards the enemie, and trauelling on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually day and night, they tooke litle or no reſt, ſcarce ſo much as might ſuffiſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. They were not long therefore ere they had gotten to the valley, where the army of <hi>Ballaban</hi> lay encamped. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> ſeizing vpon the toppe of the ſame valley, did
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:13368:238"/>
pitch his campe with moſt excellent aduantage, by reaſon that he enuironned the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie who lay below him in the plaine: for he extended his companies throughout all the toppes of the mountains which encloſed the vally, occupying all the ſtreights and paſſages, in ſuch ſort that he had encloſed on all ſides, and (as it were) hedged in the Barbarians, whom he viſited alſo with often and daily skirmiſhes, ſometimes on the flanckes and ſides of their campe, ſometimes at their backes, becauſe he would hold them in doubt and ſuſpence of his intent and meaning.</p>
            <p>The next day following <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> called a councell of his nobles and Chieftains,<note place="margin">Councel held by Scanderbeg for his proceedings againſt Balla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban.</note> at the which were preſent <hi>Tanuſee Thopie, Zacharie Groppe</hi> and <hi>Peic Manuell</hi> his Lieutenants. Many of them were of this opinion: that the battell ſhould be deferred till ſuch time as the ſouldiers were very wel refreſhed of their long iorney and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lately endured: and that <hi>Tanuſee</hi> ſhould haue ſome leiſure to take a taſte of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, &amp; to keepe him doing in the meane while. But <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> was of another mind, and he did not onely perſwade, but he did inſtantly vrge and preſſe them, that they ſhould not by their delaies and daliance bring his determinations and counſels into hazard and daunger, the ſuertie whereof conſiſted in nothing ſo much as in prompt and ſpeedie execution:: That <hi>Ballaban</hi> his armie might eaſily be broken and defeated,<q>

Wherefore it behooueth vs with all ſpeed to found to horſebacke, to bid the battell to our enemies, and not to loſe this aduantage which their error and ouerſight hath giuen vs now that their two Generalles are thus deuided, the one abſent, the other preſent. This opinion preuailed, and the aſſembly being diſſolued: behold now how <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> did prepare himſelfe to the combat. Of all his ſquadrons he made foure<note place="margin">Order of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie againſt Ballaban in the ſecond bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell of Valcala.</note> battels:</q> the one he committed to <hi>Tanuſee,</hi> the ſecond to <hi>Zacharie Groppe,</hi> and of the third, <hi>Peic Manuell</hi> had the charge and conduct: the infanterie was mingled among the horſemen, and the Harguebuſſiers and Archers were mixed pell mell with the pikes and certaine horſemen, whom he ſent forth to skirmiſh with the enemie, and to begin the fight. The reſidue of the armie together with the ſquadron which he had for the gard of his perſon, he reſerued to be commaunded by himſelfe.

            <p>Hauing thus ſpoken, the alarme was ſounded, and they began to march all at once. The Barbarians who ſtood readie raunged in order of battell with enſignes diſplaied before their campe, did now expect and were determined to haue bene doing with their enemies: but <hi>Ballaban</hi> ſtaying for his companion did prolong the time of the fight, and ſounded the retrait, commaunding ſome to watch when <hi>Iagup</hi> would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in ſight.

For all this was the Painim firme in his determination, and he would not moue a foote: but refuſing to enter the liſtes, or to come to fight, he kept his: people within their trenches: and the more that our men did preſſe vpon them and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune them, being euen readie to giue the aſlault vnto his campe, the more did he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuile and make from them. <hi>Ballaban</hi> his ſouldiers conceiuing foule deſpite, and being vehemently incenſed for that they could not be ſuffered to iſſue out to encounter with their enemies, they cryed out and exclaimed againſt their Generall, they murmured and gnaſhed with their teeth for verie rage and anger: and if the holding of them backe by their Generall on the one ſide did animate and ſet them in a heat: no leſſe did the inſolencie and brauerie of the <hi>Epirots</hi> make them eger and ſharpe ſet, who were now vppon the point to force their rampiers: inſomuch that both on the one part and the other, their courages were terribly enflamed and incenſed ech againſt other. <hi>Ballaban</hi> neuertheleſſe ſtill ſtayed his ſouldiers and temporized to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of his power.

was the ſlaughter on the one ſide and the other: and the two Generals in proper perſon, drew the eyes of all men towards them.

Then did <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> giue a newe charge vppon them, preſſing them both before and behind, and enforcing himſelfe by all poſſible meanes to put them out of array, he cryed all aloft vnto his people, ſaying.</p>
            <p>How now (my friends) what did we make ſuch haſt hitherwardes, did we rid ſo<note place="margin">Speech of Scanderbeg to his ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them in fight againſt Ballaban</note> much way, and did we make ſo long and ſpeedie iourneyes to no ende and purpoſe? Shall we ſuffer our ſelues to be helde ſo ſhort by the ſame Chiefetaine, by the ſame troupes which we haue ſo many times diſcomfited, chaſed, and ouerrunne?</p>
            <p>All this notwithſtanding hauing more then once endeuored and ſtriued but all in vaine to breake and ſcatter them on that ſide, he made choiſe of certaine ſquadrons out of the right wing which he thought would haue leaſt to doe, and would rather ſtand idle then be employed in the fight, and cauſing them to wheele about and to conuey themſelues behinde the enemie at their backes, without being apperceiued either by the aduerſe party or by their owne companie, he did therewithall ſtrike in vppon the lefte wing of the enemie with ſuch furie and celeritie: that when as they thought to haue found and to haue receiued him vpon the flancke and ſide of their battallion, he was ſuddenly gotten behind them and charged them at their backs: in ſuch ſort that the <hi>Alchanzes</hi> &amp; the <hi>Alophages</hi> found themſelues aſſailed &amp; endamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on all ſides both in front and in flancke, and in their rereward: ſo that the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter began now alſo to grow vpon the <hi>Aſappi</hi> who made litle and no reſiſtaunce. For the moſt part of them the night before had abſented themſelues from their enſignes, and were licentiouſly diſperſed all ouer the fieldes, and there lay ſome of them ſtill wallowing vpon the ground, ouercome with ſleepe and trauell, and the reſt which were then preſent in the battell being wearied with their late trauell and with ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watching (being a tender and ſoft kind of people, and ill able to endure the heate of the yeare and hard trauell) ſcarce could they abide their armes vpon their backes. For the ſunne being then at the higheſt, made them in that caſe, that partly with extreme heate, and partly with thirſt, their enemies found them as men halfe dead, and they fell into their hands by heapes to be taken or ſlaine at their pleaſures. <hi>Ballaban,</hi> who had oftentimes purchaſed great honour and commendation in the like battelles, in this iourney behaued himſelfe more nobly then in any other whatſoeuer. For part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by encouraging his men in the fight, and partly alſo by hazarding his perſon to all daungers: one while egging and preſſing them forward, another while blaming and rebuking thoſe that were backward, and ſometimes by recalling of ſuch as fled: he did for a long time maintaine the fight well and worthely: ſtill animating his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, and renuing the conflict in many places where he ſaw his people to waxe faint and to giue ouer. At the laſt when he ſawe that the fortune of the field did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline<note place="margin">Victorie of Scanderbeg the fourth time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Balla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban and the Turkes.</note> to the <hi>Epirots,</hi> and that he could no longer ſuſtaine their violence, he chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his reſolution, and ſetting ſpurres to his horſe, he turned his backe and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himſelfe from the fight of the Chriſtians. After him their whole armie did the like: for perceiuing their rancks to be ſcattered &amp; diſordered, euery man began to flie ſome here, ſome there, ouer the fieldes into the mountaines and through the woods
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:13368:240"/>
according as ech man his fortune good or bad did guide and direct him. Some fewe there were who following their Generall, eſcaped together with him, and got away from the ſwordes of their enemies, and from the ſlaughter of their fellowes. All the reſt of the Barbarians were either ſlaine or taken priſoners: and if it happened, that any were gotten free from the furie and confuſion of the chaſe, yet were they cut in peeces by thoſe that kept the toppes and paſſages of the mountaines: in ſo much, that of the whole hoaſt and armie of <hi>Ballaban,</hi> there were verie fewe left aliue. As for thoſe ſmall reliques which remained, they were not in any ſort purſued, becauſe there was a ſudden rumour and report, that there was a newe and freſh enemie comming againſt them.</p>
            <p>Scarce were the Chriſtians departed out of the valley of <hi>Valcala,</hi> and the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers had not yet made an ende of parting and deuiding the ſpoyles of their ſlayne enemies: but that there came a meſſenger from <hi>Mamiſa</hi> the Kings ſiſter, in poaſt haſte from <hi>Petrella</hi> (where this Ladie then lay with her guard and her houſholde) by whom ſhe aduertiſed <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> that <hi>Iagup Arnauth</hi> with ſixteene thouſand horſe was entred into <hi>Epyre</hi> by the way of <hi>Belgrade,</hi> where he waſted and deſtroyed all things: and that he was then encamped in the lower <hi>Tyranna,</hi> neere adioyning to<note place="margin">Iagup Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauth encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped at Argilat in Epire.</note> a riuer which the inhabitants name <hi>Argilat.</hi> This Turke was an <hi>Epyrot</hi> by birth, and his parents were both of them Chriſtians: himſelfe hauing beene taken and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed by the Turkes did profeſſe their ſuperſtitions. He was a man of great har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe and valure, and in times paſt both in <hi>Aſia</hi> and in <hi>Greece,</hi> had left many good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and commendable teſtimonies of his prowes vnder <hi>Mahomet.</hi> His comming into <hi>Epyre</hi> was (as we haue ſaide) to encloſe the Prince of <hi>Albanie</hi> betweene his forces and the armie of his companion: for one of his owne ſouldiers hauing beene taken by the people of <hi>Mamiſa,</hi> and being examined vpon the cauſe and motiue to this voyage, had confeſſed the ſame and did iuſtifie the truth hereof vnto them. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently vpon this aduertiſement, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> concluded to goe with his whole armie dirctly to <hi>Tiranna:</hi> which being now in a readineſſe to march, he thought it good before his departure, thus to encourage his ſouldiers.</p>

Now by the grace of God and your vertue, in ſtead of diminiſhing his ſhame and ignominie, he hath made it a great deale greater. Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how euen now againe, before our hands be cleane, or that we haue made an ende of this laſt repaſte, and before that the cloth (as I may ſay) is taken away: ſee I pray you, how <hi>Iagup Arnauth</hi> a noble and bountifull banquettour is come to inuite vs to a new banquet, becauſe he would haue vs to make an end of our feaſt: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loath that his gueſtes ſhould be defrauded of good and conuenient entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he hath brought vs his armie alſo for a ſecond courſe: ſee I ſay (my deare frends) how before we are gotten out of this valley, and haue (as it were) waſhed our hands embrued with the bloud of our enemies: before we haue wiped the bloud off our ſwords, or haue ſheathed them in our ſcabbords: <hi>Iagup</hi> is likewiſe come vnto vs: he offreth vs good and friendly preſents, that is, his troupes and ſquadrons, that you may vſe and diſpoſe of them at your pleaſures,</q> either to take a taſte of them, or elſe altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

to deuoure and conſume them. Go we therfore (my good companions) go we to this mariage feaſt whereunto <hi>Iagup</hi> doth inuite vs and doth ſo earneſtly call vs: let vs eate our fill of his dainties, &amp; when we ſhall haue gluttted our ſelues, let vs carry ſome part alſo away with vs. Let vs make all ſpeed and diligence to be gone from hence, let vs goe and meet with <hi>Iagup,</hi> whom (I dare aſſure you) we will quickely ouerthrow and bring to confuſion: for theſe are but a handfull of men in compariſon of thoſe that were with <hi>Ballaban:</hi> beſides, me thinkes I ſee that the warlike furie, and the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall fierceneſſe of your courages doth yet continue burning and flaming within you.</p>
            <p>Scarcely had <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> ended his ſpeech, but he might ſee his ſouldiers wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully incenſed and inflamed: all of them with high cries and clamours entreated him<note place="margin">Scanderbeg marcheth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Iagup.</note> to leade them preſently to this ſecond banquet: whereupon being full of hope and courage they remoued their campe, and with enſignes diſplaied tooke their way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Tiranna</hi> there to affront and encounter with <hi>Iagup.</hi> Is it not a ſtraunge matter to ſee and conſider the maruellous audacitie, and the confident reſolution of this people, that being but newly gotten out of ſo great a daunger, and their woundes yet ſcarce ſtaunched, and the ſweat of their former toyle and labour yet ſcant wiped off their faces, yet you ſhould now ſee them thus prompt and forward to depart pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently and out of hand againſt a new enemie, and one that had ſo great a puiſſance &amp; whole forces which were yet freſh, ſound and entire? But you may thinke that they were not a litle hardened and emboldened by the preſence and happie fortune of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> by his ſage experience and prudent conduct, and by the conſideration of his inuincible valour and prowes. In like manner, the daily exerciſe and continuall frequentation of deeds of armes by this nation did not a litle encreaſe that confidence in them: and beſides, what reaſon had they to ſtand in any feare of the Turkiſh power and puiſſance, which had bene the ordinarie and continuall ſubiect of their glory &amp; reputation? Notwithſtanding, to ſpeake more like a Chriſtian, and to coniecture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right of this their wonderfull reſolution &amp; hardines: I for my part do verily beleeue, (the iſſue and euent of matters doth argue no leſſe) and that this was a thing meerely diuine and miraculous. But to our hiſtorie.</p>

               <hi>Arnauth</hi> being enformed that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> did approch, truſſed vp baggage and diſlodged from thence: being not as yet acquainted nor knowing any thing of the miſfortune of his companion: and he retired himſelfe into one of the moſt recuiled angles and corners of <hi>Tiranna</hi> neare vnto a litle mountainet or hill vppon the which<note place="margin">Iagup encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped at Caſſar.</note> was a certaine ſmall village, of the inhabitaunts named <hi>Caſſar:</hi> which place he found to be of moſt ſafetie and ſecuritie to encampe in. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> ſeized vppon that place from whence the other was lately departed. During all that day both the campes lay verie quiet. Howbeit, true it is, that the <hi>Albanois</hi> did paſſe the night following in great care and iealouzie for feare leaſt that <hi>Iagup</hi> and his armie ſhould diſcampe the ſame night, if by chaunce he ſhould haue any inckling of the defait of <hi>Ballaban.</hi> For this cauſe, all the waies and paſſages were ſeized vpon and beſet with armed men.

            <p>The King of <hi>Albanie</hi> ſent foorth 500 vauntcurrours to draw foorth <hi>Iagup</hi> to the combat: and he charged them not to ioyne in fight with the Infidell, but when they ſhould ſee them to breake out vpon them, that then they ſhould retire in good order:<note place="margin">The battell of Caſſar betwene Scanderbeg &amp; Iagup.</note> and ſo it happened accordingly. <hi>Iagup</hi> had deuided his armie into three troupes or battallions, and he was quickly gotten out of his trenches to follow after the <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> horſemen: vnto whom <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> calling and willing them to turne about, and to make head againſt the enemie: in an inſtant he ioyned himſelfe vnto them: and all of them together endured the ſhocke of the Paynim comming fiercely vpon them.

Their Chieftaine being layed on the ground, euerie man ſtriued who ſhould flie faſteſt: they that were beſt mounted were moſt happie in this daunger: euerie man forgot his brother, his friend and his companion, and happie was he that could make ſhift for himſelfe.

The towne being in this great feare &amp; ſuſpence, did at the firſt receiue this doubtfull and vncertaine newes, namely: that two horſemen <hi>Dibrians</hi> (who were returned from the battell to the Campe vpon the confines of <hi>Epire</hi>) had reported: that the enemy was defeated. This report was entertained at the firſt more with their eares, then with anie beliefe of their mindes, as a thing too ſtrange, and ſo much deſired, that it was thought too good to be true, beſides the haſtineſſe and celerity of the report did make it of the leſſe credit, becauſe it was ſpoken two daies before the fight fell out. After this <hi>Tanuſe</hi> ſent letters from the Campe, ſignifying the comming of thoſe two <hi>Dibrian</hi> horſemen: thoſe letters being caried through the market place of <hi>Croy</hi> to the pallace, did cauſe ſo great a concourſe of people to aſſemble at the gate of the pallace, that the bearer could not paſſe through them, but he was pulled and drawen with great violence by ſome that were inquiſitiue after newes: &amp; they cried out aloft that the letters ſhould be read openly in the market place, before they ſhould be caried to the Magiſtrate. After that they had been read in the Pallace, according as the diuerſity of mens humors did cary them, ſo did they thinke and imagine of the truth of the matter: ſome were fully ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and reioyced at the newes: others beleeued neuer a word, till ſuch time as they had heard either the meſſengers themſelues to ſpeak it, who were ſent from the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall, or elſe the letters read vnto them. After all this the report went, that the Marſhall himſelfe was comming thither in perſon: at which time all ſorts of perſons, and of all ages, ranne haſtily forth to meete him, and they went out in ſuch continuall flockes and troupes, that they reached about halfe a league without the gates, euery one ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to be the firſt, that ſhould with their eies and with their eares, ſwallow vp the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding greatneſſe of this expected ioy. <hi>Tanuſe</hi> was the man whom they went thus to meete withall, who being enuironned on all ſides with this rude and confuſed mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, arriued at laſt in the market place, of the city: where ſome enquiring of him ſelfe, others of them that followed him, how all matters ſtood, and what good newes they had brought: when they heard for certaine, that both the armies of the enemy were diſcomfited: that one of the Generals was ſlaine: that the <hi>Albanian</hi> Legions were ſafe and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

At length, the letters being read in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, then did <hi>Tanuſe</hi> recount more at large the proceedings and iſſue of the whole voyage, whereat there was a moſt wonderfull applauſe and acclamation of all the Senate: and they were not in any ſort able to moderate the extremity of their ioy. After this, ſome viſited the temples to yeelde thankes and praiſes vnto God: others made haſt to repaire to their owne houſes, to the intent they might communicat and impart theſe happy tidings to their wiues and children. The Magiſtrats by a ſolemne edict, commaunded publicke praiers and proceſſions for three daies together, for the victory and health of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> and his army: the like decree was made by the Queene and her counſell, which was very deuoutly obſerued and kept. During all which time, you might haue ſeene the Churches filled &amp; frequented, both with men and women all alike: and the auncient Matrones and Ladies being richly and ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly apparelled, with their litle children, did humbly and chearfully performe their vowes and publicke thankes vnto the deuine Maieſty, as if the enemy had bene vtterly deſtroyed and conſumed, and as if the warre had bene fully determined and ended, and that all feare and ſuſpition had bene quite gone and exiled: and more then that, this victory did ſo ſettle and eſtabliſh the eſtate of the towne, as if they had gotten an aſſured reſt and tranquillity for euer.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being thus accompliſhed and ended, with no ſmall religion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion: <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> (becauſe he would the more terrifie the enemy) entred vpon his territories, and paſſing on a good way into the country, filled all places with fire and<note place="margin">Inuaſion by Scanderbeg into the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh territories.</note> ſword, with bloud and terror: beſides that, he caried away an incredible booty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſiſtaunce made againſt him: and ſo retyring with exceeding ioy into his owne Prouince, and hauing left (according to his wonted cuſtome) a ſtrong garriſon vpon his frontiers, he returned with great triumph and generall reioycings to <hi>Croy</hi> his<note place="margin">Scanderbeg his returne and triumph at Croy after his victory.</note> chiefe city, where hauing for certaine daies (together with his citizens) celebrated the ſolemnity and common ioy of this glorious victory: he diſpatched away letters and meſſengers to the moſt part of the Kings and Princes of Chriſtendome, with magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent giftes of diuerſe ſortes, choſen out of the ſpoiles, that had bene taken vppon his enemies, as excellent good horſes, ſlaues, armours, and rich furnitures and capariſons for horſes, with ſuch like rare and goodly preſents.

               <p>MAhomet enraged for the diſcomfiture of Ballaban and Iagup, prepareth to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Epire in proper perſon: and Scanderbeg prouideth to receiue him. Mahomet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpireth the death of Scanderbeg by treaſon: which is diſcouered, &amp; the traitors ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted. Croy is beſieged by Ballaban, Mahomet him ſelfe comming to the ſiege, and being out of hope to cary the towne by force, returneth towards Conſtantinople, and leaueth Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laban to continue the ſiege of Croy. Mahomet in his returne ſurprizeth Chidna by treaſon, &amp; infidelity, putting the inhabitants to the ſword. Scanderbeg maketh a iourney to Rome, to get aide of the Pope and the Chriſtians for the reliefe of Croy, but returneth with ſmall comfort: he is ſuccoured by the Venetians. Ionima the brother of Ballaban, with his ſonne Heder, comming to the aide of Ballaban, are ſurprized by Scanderbeg, and both of them ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken priſoners. Scanderbeg inuadeth the Campe of the Infidels: a ſallie is made by the Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians vpon the Turkes, wherein Ballaban is ſlaine. The Turkes breake vp their ſiege before Croy: and depart out of Epire. Chidna is recouered, and Epire cleanſed of the Infidels. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet maketh a ſecond iourney into Epire: buildeth Valure, and beſiegeth firſt Duraz, and after Croy: but he raiſeth his ſiege from both of them. Chiurill a towne newly builded, and vnfinished by Scanderbeg, is razed by Mahomet, who returneth to Conſtantinople. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libeg and Aliazbeg are ſent with an army to ſafegard the Turkish frontiers. Scanderbeg preparing to recouer Valures from the Turkes, ſickeneth: he diſpoſeth and ordereth his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. Ahamat with an army of fifteene thouſand Turkes, inuading and ſpoiling the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian territories flieth out of Epire, and is defeated by the Epirots.

Wherefore being afraied leaſt that Fortune would now proue a ſtepdame vnto him, &amp; croſſe him in his attempts, and that (after ſo many proſperities and continuall fauours, ſhee would now in the end reuolt and fall away from him, and retiring vnto his fierceſt

            <p>
               <q>You are not ignorant (my good friendes) how that I neuer made any ſpare of my<note place="margin">Oration of Mahomet to his chieftains purpoſing a iourney a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg in proper perſon.</note> trauell and paines, nor of any hazardes or daungers, but that I haue bene alwaies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall of my proper life and ſafety, for the increaſe of the faith of our chiefe Prophet: for the augmentation of the name and Empire of the houſe of <hi>Ottoman:</hi> for the ſurety and ſafety of you and your families: and to make this eſtate of ours peaceable, quiet, and floriſhing. In all our actions and expeditions wherein we our ſelues haue beene preſent, and which haue bene vndertaken by vs in proper perſon, we haue found For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune friendly and fauorable vnto vs: and yet at this time I know not what to ſay, of this petty Prouince of <hi>Epire,</hi> and of this petty Prince <hi>Scanderbeg;</hi> as often as I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the infamous death of ſo many excellent chieftaines and generals of our hoaſts, and the totall diſcomfiture or ſhamefull captiuity of ſo many flouriſhing armies: nor can I tell what to make of it, vnleſſe it be that the Demon or Angell of this Apoſtata, and rebellious renegado doe fight for him, and do ſurmount the Demon of all thoſe who are oppoſed againſt him. We may ſee then that this buſineſſe doth require the rigour of a more furious and violent hand, and of ſome Chieftaine who is more happy and fortunate in his enterpriſes. I am determined (my good friends) and in my opinion it is the beſt and moſt conuenient courſe, that we take this warre into our owne hands, and that we make a iourney into <hi>Epire</hi> in our proper perſon, with more puiſſant and ſolemne preparations then <hi>Amurath</hi> our father did at his going againſt the <hi>Albanois.</hi> Then ſhall that fugitiue and traitour <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> well perceiue, euen with the loſſe of his hatefull head, that it is nothing to haue a Baſſa, a Saniacke, or an Aga to beard him: but that it is another manner of matter, to be inuaded with the preſence and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty of a moſt mighty, puiſſant, and fortunate Monarch, that ſhall employ his whole power, and bend the fury of all his forces againſt him. And although the glorious memory of our deceaſed father, did not cary away the entire honour of this voyage, but did yeelde vp his ghoſt in the perſuite thereof, yet ought not the honour and praiſe of that iourney, be attributed to the vertue or proweſſe of that ſlaue, or his Chriſtians: but rather to the imbecillity of his age, and the infirmity of his decaying yeares, as ſhortly alſo we ſhall ſee the like to befall and betide euen to <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> him ſelfe, who is now vpon the declining of his age, and will euen in a moment finde his fortune to waxe old and faint: and that ſame viuacity and liuelines of his ſpirit, and the vigorous diſpoſition of his lims and members will faile and forſake him: ſo as in the end he will ſinke vnder the burden of his affaires. For the nature and property of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, is to delight in the flouriſhing time of youth, and ſhee ſeeketh out and deſireth to be reſident with thoſe, whoſe minds are tranſported with ſwelling ambition, &amp; with<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> ſtirring thoughts: and as the heat of bloud waxeth coole, &amp; as this vigour of the mind groweth to be weakned: ſo doth fortune likewiſe wax cold, &amp; doth vſe to diſcontinue her fauors: and therfore I make no doubt, but that in an inſtant, I ſhal vtterly confound this vnhappy Chriſtian, together with his people and poſterity: who being become more arrogant by the happy ſucceſſe of ſo many good encounters, doth daily moleſt
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:13368:243"/>
my ſubiects, ouerrunning and deſtroying all my Prouince of <hi>Macedonie.</hi> And if it happen that he fall into my ſnares, and that I can get him within my reach, I will exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute vpon his wretched body, (being the ſubiect of all vice &amp; wickedneſſe) all kindes and examples of extreame crueltie: becauſe, beſides the diſpeaſure done me in the death of my father, this Hydra, this monſter of all miſchiefes, hath infinitly prouoked againſt him my iuſt wrath and indignation. But fooliſh man as he is, let him take his pleaſure for a time, let him hold on his courſe yet a while, let him glory in his goodly realme, and in his ambitious pouerty, whileſt the deſtinies do permit and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him: it ſhall not be long, ere I will ſwallow him vp in endleſſe ruine and perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This therefore is my aduiſe, that we goe right on to <hi>Croy,</hi> the capitall and chiefe ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that Prouince, with ſo great forces and puiſſance, that it ſhall not be able to hold out againſt vs. For when <hi>Croy</hi> is ouercome and conquered, all the other places and ſtrong holds of the countrey will be ſoone reduced to the ſame eſtate and condition.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This matter being propounded by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and approued by the generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and voices of his Viſits and Captaines: infinite commiſsions were granted forth, and publike proclamation was made throughout all the territories and dominions<note place="margin">Mahomet lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uteth a mightie army againſt Scanderbeg.</note> vnder the Turke his obeyſaunce: that all men which were apt to beare armes, ſhould repaire to the Commiſsioners, and cauſe their names to be enrolled: inſomuch that innumerable forces were leauied, and in the meane time, prouiſion was made of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, inſtruments, engines, and other neceſſaries for the Campe, all which being in a readineſſe, the Turkiſh Monarch with a moſt proud and glorious traine, tooke his way towards <hi>Epire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vpon theſe troubles and tumults approaching, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> wanted not his intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencers, and ordinary ſpies, but that they gaue him ſure and ſpeedy aduertiſements of all things, which was the occaſion that he aſſembled all his friendes and nobles, and amongſt others, <hi>Paul Angell</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Duraz,</hi> vnto whom he imparted his moſt<note place="margin">Ioſaphat Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare, ſome ſaie he was the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueditore of the Venetians.</note> ſecret counſels: and to them he adioyned alſo <hi>Ioſaphat Barbare</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour, a worthy perſonage of great iudgement and experience, and ſingularly zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of the Chriſtian religion, who together with the Archbiſhop, was ſeldome or neuer from the ſide of the Prince of <hi>Albanie.</hi> By the generall aduiſe and conſent of this aſſembly, it was ordained, that all the townes, places, and fortreſſes of the realme, ſhould be diligently furniſhed and prouided with victuals, and other neceſſary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſions, and fortified with good and faithfull garriſons: eſpecially <hi>Croy,</hi> the principall bulwarke, and ſtay of all the eſtate of <hi>Albany,</hi> and whereuppon all the reſt depended. He prouided therefore, and ſtuffed it with good ſtore of ſouldiers, part of them <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois,</hi> and part <hi>Italians,</hi> all of them of approued loyalty and reſolution: and he made<note place="margin">Balthaſar Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, gouernour of Croy.</note> choiſe of an <hi>Italian</hi> Gentleman to be gouernour of the towne, one <hi>Balthaſar Perduce,</hi> a man highly eſteemed for his prudence, iudgement, and reſolution.</p>

Thus went <hi>Mahomet</hi> out of <hi>Epyre</hi> bathed in the bloud of innocents, and hauing left <hi>Ballaban</hi> behind him with innumerable troupes, he had giuen him ſtreight charge to continue the ſiege of <hi>Croy,</hi> euen to the laſt point of extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, and till ſuch time as the inhabitants being worne out with the length of time, and being conſumed and weakened with famine and calamities, ſhould be enforced to yeeld them ſelues vnto him, euen with halters about their neckes.</p>
            <p>All this while was <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> very ſad &amp; penſiue to ſee ſo many enemies within the hart of his Realme, but that which greeued him moſt was, that ſuch a villain as <hi>Ballaban</hi> (whoſe parents and predeceſſours, had euer bene but as baſe varlets, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile drudges to the houſe and familie of the <hi>Caſtriots,</hi> and to whom he had giuen ſo many ouerthrowes and diſgraces) ſhould yet for all this be ſtill oppoſed and make war againſt him, and that he ſhould dare to compare with him, and to braue him. For this cauſe he had an extreme deſire by all meanes poſsible to entrappe him, and if he could by any deuiſe in the world, to worke his confuſion, but he wanted meanes and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to compaſſe ſo high and difficult an enterpriſe, eſpecially ſince the loſſe of <hi>Chidna,</hi> whereof he made great reckoning, by reaſon of the good number of braue ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, which he had in that place.

            <p>This Oration of the King of <hi>Epyre,</hi> was harkened vnto with no leſſe attentiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then accepted with the allowaunce, and good liking of the whole Conſiſtorie, and euery man ſayd openly, that it was moſt requiſite and neceſſarie to ſuccour, with all ſpeede and diligence, their Chriſtian brethren, and not to ſuffer ſo noble a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince and ſo vertuous a people to be deuoured and ſwallowed vp by ſo cruell and bloudthirſty an enemie. But all theſe ſmooth ſpeeches, fayre wordes and goodly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, whereof they gaue him plenty, proued in the end nothing elſe then court fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, &amp; vaniſhed into ſmoake: what the cauſe thereof ſhould be I know not, but ſo it happened, that at his departure from thence (which was ſoone after) he had litle and<note place="margin">Scanderbeg ill ſuccoured by the Chriſtians.</note> very ſmall ſuccour of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the ſecond, who (though he were a <hi>Venetian</hi> borne) yet was but badly affectioned towards his owne countrey: to the which <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> was a moſt inward and faithfull friend, ouer and beſides the ſtrict and ancient knot of friendſhip and confederacy, which had beene preſerued and nouriſhed with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion betweene him and that common-wealth.

He was once in the minde to haue gone as farre as <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice:</hi> but taking aduiſe vpon the matter, and not finding it expedient, by reaſon of the piteous eſtate wherein he had left his kingdome and countrey of <hi>Epire:</hi> he contented himſelfe to ſend thither his Secretary, to let the Senate of that city vnderſtand, the hard ſucceſſe of his voyage to <hi>Rome,</hi> and to animate &amp; perſwade them to miniſterſome aide<note place="margin">Aide giuen by the Venetians and others to Scanderbeg for the reliefe of Croy againſt the Turkes.

In like maner <hi>Lech Ducagin,</hi> and <hi>Nicholas</hi> his brother, being brauelie mounted, came vnto him with 400. valiaunt horſemen, and as many footmen, all of them moſt expert and skilfull ſouldiers. To theſe did adioyne them ſelues a hundreth

For you are to note that the Princes &amp; peoples of <hi>Epyre, Macedony, Scla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uony</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> which were leagued and allyed together, did not faile to ſend ech of them certaine forces, all which made their <hi>rende vous</hi> at a place appointed, and were at the command and diſpoſition of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> who deuided them into two troupes: one part whereof he committed to the conduct and leading of <hi>Lech Ducagin</hi> aboue named, being a knight of no leſſe policie then hardineſſe in the warres: and <hi>Nicholas</hi>

               <hi>Moneta</hi> borne in <hi>Scutarie,</hi> the <hi>Vaiuoda,</hi> or gouernor of that citie, being a Gentleman of great eſtimate and valure, had the guiding of the other part of thoſe forces. Now it was ſet downe and appointed, that theſe troupes being diſlodged from <hi>Liſſa,</hi> and hauing cut ouer the plaine countrie or fieldes of <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> and the foreſt of <hi>Ionimes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Foreſt of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimes.</note> ſhould make their approach, and charge vppon the enemie on that ſide. And that the King of <hi>Epyre</hi> being accompanied with his owne bandes both horſe and foote, ſhould make towardes the mountaine of <hi>Cruyna,</hi> there to aſſaile and ſet vpon <hi>Ballaban</hi> on the otherſide, who had encloſed &amp; fortified himſelfe exceeding ſtrongly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently vpon that mountaine. But before I will leade our Chriſtians any further into the countrie, I holde it not amiſſe to figure and deſcribe vnto you the ſite of the place where the <hi>Mahometan</hi> had entrenched him ſelfe, to the intent the matter may be the better repreſented to your ſight, and made more plaine and apparant vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.</p>
            <p>I told you long ſithence, that <hi>Croy</hi> is in <hi>Epyre,</hi> in the fields of <hi>Emathia</hi> or <hi>Pharſalia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The ſituation of Croy.</note> ſeated vpon the high creſt or ridge of a mountaine: which in the circuit and compaſſe thereof is on all parts enuironed with many ſteepe downefals, excepting in one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly place where it is very hardly to be approached, and is deuided and cut off from the mount <hi>Cruyna,</hi> which being very nigh, &amp; continuing on euen cloſe to the towne, doth ſeeme much higher then the ſame, and to haue the commaund thereof. This moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine runneth a long by the ſide of the Caſtle of <hi>Croy,</hi> where hanging ouer it with a deepe cliffe, after a ſmall deſcent it doth deuide it ſelfe into diuerſe hils or litle mounts. In this place had <hi>Ballaban</hi> placed his campe, and hauing drawen thither the maſſe or maine ſtrength of his armie, he had gotten the poſſeſſion of the mountaine of <hi>Cruyna,</hi> the which hauing fortified and garded with a great and ſtrong garriſon, he did preſſe the towne with a hard and grieuous ſiege.</p>
            <p>But leauing him there encamped, let vs returne to our troupes. Their plot being laide as is before mentioned, and their bandes being deuided, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> with his forces went firſt on to viſite the enemie: and being come to the ſaide mountaine, he receiued aduertiſement, that <hi>Ionyme</hi> the brother of <hi>Ballaban</hi> was marching on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes<note place="margin">Ionime brother to Ballaban co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming with a ſupply of Turks to his brother is ſurpriſed by Scanderbeg.</note> his brother with a good number of Turkes: and the report went that he was alreadie paſt the mountaine of <hi>Bulgarie.</hi> Immediatly vppon theſe newes <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> with ſingular promptneſſe and reſolution, tooke with him the choiſe and flower of his army: and (hauing cauſed the reſidue to keepe themſelues ſtill and quiet) he roade all that night with extreame ſpeede and diligence to meete with <hi>Ionyme,</hi> whom ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſurpriſed on a ſudden and vnprouided, he ſoone broke and diſperſed, taking him<note place="margin">Ionyme and his ſonne Heder taken priſoners</note> aliue with <hi>Heder</hi> his ſonne likewiſe, and the ſame night with no leſſe ſpeede then he went forwarde, he returned to his companie with the victorie. The next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he brought foorth and preſented to the ſight of <hi>Ballaban,</hi> his brother and his
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:13368:248"/>
Nephew bound and tyed together. And thereupon giuing a braue charge vpon the garriſon of the Turkes which lay vppon the mount <hi>Cruyna,</hi> he chaſed them from<note place="margin">Scanderbeg chaſeth the Turkes from the mount Cruyna.</note> thence, and being ſeized of the place, he tooke vp his lodging vppon the toppe of the mountaine, giuing preſent order that his confederates ſhould haue notice thereof out of hande. Nowe <hi>Ballaban</hi> (who promiſed him ſelfe ſome intelligence within <hi>Croy</hi>) was wonderfully abaſhed to ſee the Chriſtians ſo ſuddainely to come ſo neere him, and to be in a manner ouer his head, and where they might commaunde him. Wherefore hauing newly encouraged and reaſſured part of his people who were ſomewhat troubled with the alarme: and letting them to vnderſtande, that the towne was ſurely their owne, if they would make any haſte to enter it, and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for their owne ſafetie, whereas otherwiſe if they fayled in the enterpriſe, it was not for them to ſtaie there any longer before <hi>Croie:</hi> knowing well that they ſhould but looſe their labour, that the daungers would be very great to continue there at the ſiege, and that it could not but coſt them deare, now that he ſaw his brother defeated and the enemie ſo forwarde which could not but be an occaſion of great inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence<note place="margin">Ballaban ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeth the Croi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to yeeld vnto him.</note> vnto them. Thus being accompanied with a good troupe, he preſented himſelfe before the walles, and went on euen almoſt to the port of the citie, perſwading and ſolliciting them within, to render themſelues vnto him: and there did he continue for a while attending the iſſue of that which he expected. The <hi>Croians</hi> being incenſed<note place="margin">Sallie by the Croians vpon Ballaban.</note> with his preſumption made a braue ſallie out vpon him, &amp; falling into skirmiſh with the Turkes, they enforced them to the retreate, and made their Chieftaine to know the vanitie of his practiſes. Herewithall <hi>Ballaban</hi> being enraged and euen madde for anger, and making head a freſh againſt the <hi>Croyans,</hi> thought by pure force to haue driuen them into the towne. But the citizens beginning to retyre in very good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, without the loſſe of anie one of their companie: it happened that one <hi>George Alexie</hi> an <hi>Epyrot</hi> borne, and a good harguebuſſier diſcharging a bullet vpon <hi>Balla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi>
               <note place="margin">George Alexie.</note> hit him quite thorough the throate, giuing him a mortall and deadly wound.

               </gap>ranne with great ſpeed and a ſwift pace euen to his tents, where he was no ſooner arriued, but he tumbled from his horſe, and fell rudely to the ground, embrewing his countrie ſoyle with his owne bloud, the deſtruction whereof hee had ſo bloudilie deſired. The fall and death of the Generall put the whole campe of the Infidelles in extreame feare and terrour: in ſo much, that the night following, the Barbarians in great ſilence<note place="margin">Siege of Croy raiſed.</note> and ſecrecie abandoned the ſiege of <hi>Croie,</hi> and retyring themſelues about eight long myles off, they encamped and fortified them ſelues verie diligently at <hi>Tyranna.</hi> The next morning vppon breake of day, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> comming to take a viewe of the enemies tentes, found them voide and emptie of men, but fully furniſhed with baggage and prouiſions, ſo that there was no want of any thing, eyther of corne or other victuals: all which he cauſed to be remoued and carried thence into <hi>Croie,</hi> the ſame being in a manner ſufficient to victuall it for one whole yeare. After this him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe entred with great triumph into the citie, where he was receiued with great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and ioy by the inhabitants, whom he highly commended (and that worthily) for their fidelitie and good perſeuerance, adding therewithall many gifts and rewards in recompence of their deſerts.<note place="margin">Meſſengers from the armie of the Turkes to Scanderbeg deſiring leaue to depart out of Epyre.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Whileſt theſe offices of ciuill courteſies paſſed betwene <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> &amp; his citizens, there came from the campe of the Barbarians lying at <hi>Tyranna,</hi> two horſmen, ſeeming to be perſons of good account and reckoning, who preſenting themſelues before <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> in the name of the Chieftains &amp; Commanders of their armie, praied him
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:13368:248"/>
to grant them that fauour which he had neuer refuſed to men of their qualitie, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that leauing their baggage, horſes, and armour, they might be ſuffered to depart with their liues onely. For they were ſore affraid, leaſt that the paſſages being fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled and laide for them, ſhould haue beene ſhut vp and fortified to encloſe and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh them within the countrie. Hereupon the King cauſed his Princes, Nobles, and Captaines ſpeedily to be aſſembled, that he might deliberate and determine vppon ſome aunſwere to be giuen to the Turkes, and might heare the aduiſe of euerie man in particular: and he tooke order in the meane while, that thoſe two horſemen ſhould<note place="margin">Councell called by Scanderbeg to conſult vpon the meſſage &amp; demaund of the Turkes.</note> be conducted into a tent, and thereto be well and gratiouſly entertayned. <hi>Ioſaphat Barbare</hi> was the firſt whoſe opinion was demaunded in this matter, but he excuſed himſelfe, ſaying: That the Seigniorie of <hi>Venice</hi> had ſent him thither to be reſident neere about the perſon of the Prince, onely to doe what it ſhould pleaſe him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund him: and therefore for his part he referred himſelfe for this matter to his owne good will and pleaſure. <hi>Lech Ducagin</hi> ſpake more liberally, and as he was a man of a fierce and forwarde diſpoſition prompt of hande, and quicke of inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſo in one worde did he acquaint them with his minde, ſaying: <hi>Embetha:</hi> which in the <hi>Albanian</hi> language ſignifieth, to horſebacke: for he ſawe no reaſon why a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie grace or mercie ſhould be ſhewed to this people, who were deuoide of all pittie, and were ſo mightily giuen to bloud-thirſtineſſe and crueltie, but that all of them ought rather to paſſe vnder the edge of the ſworde. Of the ſame opinion were the moſt part of the aſſembly, eſpecially <hi>Paul Angell</hi> the Archbiſhoppe, who propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ſet before his eyes the example of <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> who in times paſt hauing in thoſe very marches broken and defeated the <hi>Pompeyans,</hi> did purſue them euen to the laſt extreamitie: that he alſo ought not to forſake his owne good fortune, which <q>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> when ſhe ſeeth her ſelfe not to be liuely and roundly followed, turneth her ſelfe with a contrarie byas, to fauour thoſe vppon whom ſhe before frowned. And many other reaſons did he alleage to that effect.</q> 
               <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> replyed vnto them in this manner.</p>
            <p>I knowe right well (moſt worthie and valiant <hi>Epyrots,</hi> and my fellowe ſouldiers)<note place="margin">Oration of Scanderbeg diſſwading his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers from purſuing the Turkes after the reliefe of Croy.</note> 
               <q>and I haue alreadie had good experience of your ſingular valure, your notable reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and the greatneſſe of your courage, whereby you haue alwayes terrified and diſcomfited your enemies: and I doe not thinke but that euen now alſo you haue both the courage and the power to breake &amp; to trample vnder your feete the reliques and remainders of theſe amazed Infidels. Neuertheleſſe (gentle warriours) it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs often to bethinke our ſelues, and to call to minde that ſage ſentence of the wiſe man. That it is the part and propertie of fooles to wiſh for a tempeſt in fayre<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> and calme weather: but it is the guiſe and faſhion of them that are wiſe, to ſeeke by all meanes, howe to remedie and auoide it, when the time and neceſſitie doe preſſe them to it. It hath pleaſed our good God, without bloud, without fight, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out murther, to ſende vs the victorie euen from heauen: the citie is deliuered, the ſiege is rayſed, <hi>Ballaban</hi> our capitall and mortall aduerſarie, is nowe laide dead vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ground, his armie is fledde, we our ſelues are in reſt and quiet, and all thinges doe ſeeme to ſmyle and fawne vpon vs: wherefore then ſhould we ſeeke to haue warte? wherefore ſhould we deſire our owne torment? why ſhould we tempt fortune that is ſo blinde and variable? you are not ignorant (my good friendes) that any fault or errour committed in the warre is irreparable and vnpoſſible to be<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> amended. In other buſineſſes and affaies, if a man be forgetfull of anything, it may be amended and corrected: but the ouerſightes of martiall matters, and of battels are paſt all hope of recouerie or amends. This is the reaſon why thoſe auncients
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:13368:249"/>
and thrice renowmed Captaines, did not ſo much eſteeme and ſet by thoſe armies which were great and populous, as thoſe which were well gouerned with good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and diſcipline. For the ſucceſſe of battels is doubtfull, the iſſue of warres is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, and doth not depend of our hande and induſtrie, but of the power and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of fortune. An enemie is alwayes to be redoubted, neuer to be deſpiſed, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to be diſeſteemed: and more then that, when the warre is ended, when the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie is obtained, yet is there no leſſe diligence euen then to be vſed, then was at the verie firſt beginning of the ſame: and we muſt not any time raſhly and vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly come to the fight or combat with our enemie. Wherefore if we ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to aduenture the chaunce of warre, and to trie the fortune of the fielde with this enemie which is now before vs, we ſhall endaunger and put in hazarde (which God defend) our owne ſafetie and our eſtate, which now (God be thanked) are in good caſe and ſecuritie. Refraine therefore this ardent and burning feruentneſſe of your courages: let the victorie which we haue alreadie gotten ſuffice and content vs: we haue had manie and great triumphes vppon our enemies, and you ought to holde your ſelues ſatisfied with ſo many murthers, with ſo many ouerthrowes giuen them, and with the manifolde fauours of fortune, which hath hitherto ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly fawned vpon you. Moreouer you ſee that the troupes of the Barbarians are exceſſiue, and in a manner innumerable, they are not of the baſer and raſcall ſort of people collected and gathered at aduentures: but they are the flower and ſtrength of all the Turkiſh forces, choſen men, ſtout, expert, ready prouided &amp; prepared to fight, armed with neceſſitie (which of all weapons is the moſt extreame and daungerous) and they deſire not, nor ſeeke after any thing elſe but battell: eyther to reuenge the death of their Generall, or to carrie home vnto their Soueraigne the report of ſome notable and worthie exploit. This their offer of rendering themſelues is but coulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and feigned; beleeue me, it is but diſſimulation, and they doe make a ſemblance onely of feare and terrour: I am well acquainted with their cunning draughts and diſguiſements, I know that this is nothing but one of their ſubtill ſleights and guile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full policies, wherein theſe men more then in any thing elſe, doe make ſingular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. Aſſure your ſelues, they deſire nothing ſo much as to come to fight with you, and to be reuenged: wherefore if we be wiſe, let vs keepe our ſelues from them, let vs not trouble them. But let it be that they doe not intende anie malice nor anie deceipt againſt vs: yet they are enraged, they are deſperate, their ſhame and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minie doth preſſe them on againſt vs, being affraide of all thinges, they feare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Nothing is ſo perillous as to ſet vppon men whoſe ſafetie conſiſteth in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſperate and without hope of ſafetie. He commonly fighteth and combatteth<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> outragiouſly, who hath no comfort left him, who relyeth not vppon hope of anie thing. And what if we doe put them all to the ſworde? what if we make them to betake themſelues to flight? yet cannot this be done without your dammage, without your loſſe, without your bloud, without the expence and coſt of many of your liues: how then can ſuch a victorie be otherwiſe to me then ruefull and lamentable? Wherefore (my louing and good ſouldiers) if you will beleeue me, if you will be counſelled and aduiſed by me: be you aſſured we will haue them all at our mercie without fight, without vſing ſwords or weapon againſt them. For they are in great want of all thinges eſpecially of bread, which fayling and being not to be gotten, an armie is eaſily vanquiſhed without fighting. Let vs ſhut vppe all the wayes and paſſages, ſo that no ſuccours nor victuall may not by any meanes come vnto them: let vs newly fortifie and ſtuffe our towne with a good and ſtrong garriſon, and let vs furniſh it with all ſortes of munitions, for the prouiſion of many
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:13368:249"/>
yeares: ſo ſhall we ſee that theſe our enemies being ſhut vp and beſieged within our confines ſhall all periſh and die miſerably of pure famine and hunger. And we ſhall ſee them vtterly ouerthrowen and deſtroyed, without ſword, without armes, and without bloudſhed.</q>

            <p>Some there were who ſhewed themſelues well pleaſed with this oration, and did allow of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> his perſwaſions, but others would not be ſatisfied therewith, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the common ſort of ſouldiers, who being growen more fierce and audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous againſt the enemy, beganne to make a great noiſe not without ſome tumult and<note place="margin">Souldiers of Scanderbeg murmure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, &amp; will not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded from following the Turkes.</note> vproare enclyning to a mutinie on all parts within the campe of the Chriſtians: cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out aloft with a loud voice, that they ought to march on directly and preſently, and to go ſeeke out the Turkes who were alreadie vanquiſhed and diſcomfited. That it was not expedient in this matter to yeelde vnto the motion of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> who ſhewed himſelfe to be growen fearefull and faint-hearted: conſidering that of a moſt fierce and furious combatant, and who had neuer refuſed any occaſion of fighting in open and plaine battell, he was now become a fearefull temporizer, and would ſeeme to diſſwade them from armes who were borne and bredde to followe armes, and whoſe onely deſire was to be doing with their enemies: that nowe the Generall did faile and was wanting to the ſouldiers, and not the ſouldiers to their Generall.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> calling vnto him the two Turkiſh meſſengers gaue them this aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere: That they ſhould goe and tell their companions, that as they came into that<note place="margin">Anſwere of Scanderbeg to the two meſſengers ſent from the Turkes.</note> countrie without his commaundement, ſo ſhould they not for his part be commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to returne from thence. Now in this meane time, the King of <hi>Epyre</hi> had ſent and diſpatched away certaine forces to gaine and ſhut vp the paſſages from the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians, whileſt that the reſidue of the Chriſtian troupes by the order and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Captaines did goe to the riuer of <hi>Iſme,</hi> where certaine veſſels lay at an ancker charged and loaden with corne, meale, ſalt-meates, and biſcuit, and did vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lade all, bringing it on lande, in ſuch ſort, that in three dayes <hi>Croie</hi> was well and ſufficiently reuictualled for ſixe yeares ſpace at the leaſt. Whileſt euerie man was thus buſied and intentiuely occupyed in this worke, and that euerie one did ſet forward and haſten this prouiſion to the vttermoſt of his power: beholde newes were brought vnto <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> that the verie ſame night about the ſecond watch, when that men are in their ſoundeſt and deepeſt ſleepe, hunger and neceſſitie (which worketh maſteries beyonde all impoſſibilitie) had preſſed the Turkes to diſlodge ſecretly from <hi>Tyranna,</hi> and with the hazard of their liues to make way for themſelues by force, and to open the paſſages which were defended againſt them by the <hi>Scanderbegians.</hi> Howbeit they could not doe it ſo cloſely, but that thoſe ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers which had the guarde and cuſtodie of the paſſages, and the inhabitants of the country ioyned together with them, did maintaine a long and obſtinate conflict with the Infidels, who with the ſlaughter of a great number of their companions, and the loſſe of the moſt part of their baggage, did at length by their ſwordes make way through the middeſt, and in deſpight of their enemies. When <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> his armie heard thereof, it cannot be expreſſed how extremely they were aggrieued and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at the matter: for their murmuring and muttering againſt <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> did ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently teſtifie the greatneſſe of their diſcontentment, imputing the whole blame thereof to him, as if this euaſion and eſcape of the enemie, had beene by his default

only. But he pacified and appeaſed them both with his bountifull gifts, and with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſpeeches: and more then that, to content them the better, he cauſed them imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly to take armes, and to march with Enſignes diſplayed into the fielde, where he gaue them the ſpoyles of thoſe other Turkes and Infidels which were found in gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon within <hi>Chaonia</hi> &amp; other places of <hi>Epyre:</hi> not ſuffering any one of them to eſcape but that they were either ſlaine or taken, being ſpoyled and ſtripped out of all. Thus hauing purged and clenſed the Prouince of this vermine, and hauing ſettled all things in good and peaceable order, euery man returned to his owne quarter loaden with the ſpoyles of the Barbarians, and with many commendations, preſentes, and great thankes giuen them by the King of <hi>Albanie.</hi>

            <p>The affaires of <hi>Epyre</hi> thus ſtanding in ſufficient good and flouriſhing eſtate, we will now leaue them for a while, and turne our diſcourſe to the Turkiſh Monarch to ſhew vnto you the griefe and diſpleaſure which he conceiued in his haughtie and great ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, aſwell for the death of <hi>Ballaban,</hi> and the diſhonourable and ſhamefull flight of his armie: as alſo for that the ſiege of <hi>Croie</hi> was raiſed to the great glorie and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of the Chriſtians. For he did ſo vnmeaſurably afflict and paſſionate himſelfe with the conceipt hereof, that he could not take any reſt, nor eate, nor drinke: but that ſtill day &amp; night his ſpirit &amp; thoughts were troubled, beating his braine, &amp; deuiſing<note place="margin">Mahomet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth a ſecond iourney into Epyre againſt Scanderbeg.</note> with himſelfe, how he might deface and aboliſh the blot of this ſhame and ignominy, and take ſome notable reuenge vppon <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi> In the ende his deliberation was, once againe to returne himſelfe in proper perſon, and with more puiſſant forces into <hi>Epyre,</hi> that by his preſence he might giue the more grace &amp; maieſtie to the enterpriſe. Hereof <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> being ſpeedily infourmed, made no delay to prepare for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing<note place="margin">Scanderbeg maketh prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ming of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet.</note> of him with all the beſt meanes and preparations that he could poſſibly make: he gaue the Princes, Seigniors and peoples his confederates to vnderſtand of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and intent of the Turke, willing them to be in a readineſſe againſt ſuch time as he ſhould ſend vnto them: and he made good prouiſion of all kinde of munition, victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and all other neceſſaries in all his ſtrong holdes and fortreſſes: in ſuch ſort, that they needed not to be affraide of any thing that the Turke could attempt againſt them.</p>
            <p>The yeare being paſt and ſpent in theſe preparations on both partes, now beganne the ſpring to come on, which being a time wherein all things beginne to budde, and grow pleaſant to the eye, and moſt fit and conuenient for warlike voyages and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, <hi>Mahomet</hi> had deferred his iourney to that ſeaſon, and accordingly aſſoone<note place="margin">Second iourney of Mahomet into Epyre.</note> as he ſaw the time to ſerue, he tooke his iourney with infinite troupes, engines, and inſtruments for aſſault of all ſortes, and with an incredible number of expert worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and artificers for this end and purpoſe which I will ſhew you. Being come to a certaine large and wide plaine commonly called <hi>Saura,</hi> he determined there to abide<note place="margin">Plaine of Saura.</note> and ſoiourne for a while, and he encampèd his armie neere to the riuer of <hi>Scombin,</hi> within the ſigniorie or principalitie of <hi>Aryamnites Comynat</hi> father in lawe to <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi>

Beſides this citie is very famous for the commoditie of the rare ſaltpits which it hath, and for the great aboundance of all kindes of marchandiſe which are brought vnto it. To be briefe, this is that famous citie of <hi>Duras</hi> which enioyed the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and with ſingular entertainement receiued the <hi>Romaine</hi> Senate, and was no leſſe famous then vnfortunate through the ciuill warres and notable ſlaughters and bloudſhed of the <hi>Romaines.</hi> But what the eſtate of it may be at this inſtant, ſince it is become Turke, and that it is reduced vnder the ſeruitude of ſo fierce and barbarous a nation who are mortall enemies to all good order and ciuilitie, I had rather leaue it to you to imagine it, then to ſpeake what I thinke of it. But to our matter.</p>
            <p>After that the <hi>Sultan</hi> had bene ſo rudely entertained before <hi>Duraz,</hi> and that his bloudie actions and attempts proued vaine and to none effect: he conceiued an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> had put himſelfe within the towne for the defence thereof; becauſe<note place="margin">The departure of Mahomet from the ſiege of Duras.</note> a great number of his people were knowen and diſcerned to be within it. This was the occaſion that he diſlodged ſpeedily from thence, and made directly towards <hi>Croy,</hi> pitching his tents before the towne in hope to aſtoniſh and appall them by the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denneſſe of his comming. For experience hauing taught him, that the endeuours and aſſayes both of his predeceſſours and of himſelfe had profited him litle or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:<note place="margin">Croy beſieged the ſecond time by Mahomet.</note> he was not of the minde that he could carrie the towne by this courſe, but his determination was to bring them to reaſon by a long and obſtinate ſiege, if <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi> would permit him. Wherefore neglecting and leauing all other counſelles, he ſummoned the <hi>Croians</hi> to yeelde themſelues vnto him, making them great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of riches and ineſtimable honours, if they would deliuer the towne into his handes. But he had no better aunſwer nowe then he had the yeare before: for they gaue him good ſtore of cannon and musket ſhot for his good-morrow: and more then that, they iſſued foorth to viſit him nearer home, with a furious and ſtout ſalley made vpon the infidels, carying away with honour and glorie many of their heads, for an argument and proofe of their good deuoire and worthie demeanour. On the other ſide, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> according to his wonted and accuſtomed manner, keeping continually vppon the skirtes of this fearefull and huge armie, and being attended with his ordinarie forces, did vnceſſantly importune and endaunger the enemie by his often inuaſions made vppon their campe both by daye and by night: and the ſlaughters and butcheries which he committed vpon them were notable and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull, inſomuch that <hi>Mahomet</hi> perceiuing the ſmall profit which he was like to purchaſe by this enterpriſe, was glad to leaue the purſuite thereof, and to reſerue himſelfe to ſome other exploit which might be more for his honour and aduantage.

<pb n="489" facs="tcp:13368:251"/>
whereſoeuer he went: and ſometimes by day, ſometimes by night would he charge and ſet vpon him, one while in the taile, another while in the flanck, and many times in the front and head of his armie: that he tooke from him all occaſions and meanes to profit himſelfe in that countrey: yea the inhabitants themſelues dwelling in the forreſtes and mountaines did ſo annoy and moleſt him, afflicting him with infinite miſchieues, ſlaughters and diſcommodities: that being in vtter diſpaire of doing any good vpon the Prouince, he returned backe againe to <hi>Constantinople</hi> more confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and full of deſpight and griefe then he was at his comming foorth.</p>

Turks: willing them onely to looke to the ſafetie and defence of his owne frontiers, and not to ſtirre or to offer any warlike violence vpon the country of the Chriſtians. Aſſoone as they were come and had ſetled themſelues vppon their borders: they fell to their wonted cunning and practiſes, ſending vnto <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> ſecretly and vnder hand cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine preſents of great value and eſtimate, in hope to draw him to haue ſome amity and friendſhip with them, and to make him ſecure and negligent. The King of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banie</hi> though he were an olde Courtier, and had bene well acquainted with theſe kindes of dealings, ſo as he could not be ouerreached nor deceiued by their ſottiſh deuiſes, yet he was content to accept of their preſents: and he ſent vnto them backe againe others of no leſſe value, in counter chaunge of thoſe which they had giuen him. And this was all that was done betweene them, becauſe he was too cleare ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and too circumſpect for them to go beyond him. For notwithſtanding theſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate courteſies and kindneſſes paſt betweene him and them, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> was minded to keepe them doing, and therefore cauſed a generall muſter and leauie of men to be made throughout all his dominions, purpoſing to get againe from the Turkes the towne of <hi>Valmes,</hi> which had bene lately built and edified by <hi>Mahomet.</hi> But (ſuch<note place="margin">1467.</note> was the will and pleaſure of the cruell deſtinies) that being detained with a grieuous maladie, he was conſtrained to deſiſt from his attempt. For after he had reuiſited all partes and quarters of his realme, and had cauſed a generall enrollment to be made of all ſuch able men, as were fit to doe him ſeruice and to beare armes for the ſafetie and defence of his eſtate: he came to the citie of <hi>Liſſa</hi> (which being vnder the ſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niorie and gouernment of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> he had euer loued and moſt dearely affected) where being determined to haue called a councell and aſſembly of all the Princes and Lordes of the league, he was ſuddenly taken with a ſtrong and violent feauer: and the<note place="margin">Scanderbeg ſickeneth.</note> force of this diſeaſe encreaſing euerie day more then other, he imagined that his laſt end began now to approach, wherefore being in doubt leaſt that death which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euitable, ſhould take him away before he had diſpoſed and ſet in order his affaires, he prayed the ſaied Princes and Lordes his confederates to enter into his bed-chamber together with the Ambaſſadours of the Siegniorie of <hi>Venice,</hi> and his chiefe Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and officers of his campe: vnto whom he framed his ſpeech in this manner.</p>

I perceiue (my friends,) I ſee well; that it is the will and pleaſure of the diuine prouidence (by the which I confeſſe and doe acknowledge, that all things are ſubſiſting and haue their being, and whereby all things are guided and gouerned) that it behooueth me now to lay aſide this mortall and fraile burthen of my bodie, to goe to another and better place, and that I muſt exchaunge the breuitie and miſeries of this life for the felicitie of true and euerlaſting ioyes: and I proteſt vnto you before God, that the thought hereof, or rather this neceſſitie which is layed vpon me, doth not in any ſort trouble nor grieue me. I do not repine againſt that law which the deſtinies did impoſe vpon vs at the time of our natiuitie: for we ought not to be aggrieued or to find fault with that which we ſuffer according to lawe and iuſtice: with this condition were we borne, that we ſhould be ſubiect to this neceſſitie of our mortalitie. And I know well, that whatſoeuer is of neceſſitie cannot be accounted miſerable to any man particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. It behooueth vs in the end to yeeld earth to earth, and to be obedient to nature: and it is required of vs as our due, that we reſigne vp this our ſoule being eternall and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall: and this ſpirit of ours which is heauenly and celeſtiall, to him which hath onely lent it vs for a time. Neuertheleſſe (my deare friends and companions) I do not receiue and embrace this fatall lot of my death and departure with ſuch courage and cheerefulneſſe: becauſe I am willing to be freed from the perilles and dangers, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would eſchew and ſhunne the trauels and labours, or becauſe I would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw my ſelfe from thoſe miſchieues and inconueniences, wherein euen till this time I haue conſumed all my beſt yeares, and haue ended my dayes for the ſeruice of God and the religion of Chriſt: for I am readie and could finde in my heart to expoſe and aduenture my life continually for the ſame, to the like or greater hazardes: but I ſee I ſee well, that this is Gods good will and pleaſure: I perceiue it is my good God that calleth me (to whom we muſt be obedient) and I muſt now retire my ſelfe out of this earthly and filthie dungeon, and from this miſerable and wretched priſon. I haue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed nature long enough, I haue liued long enough, I haue finiſhed the courſe, and
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:13368:252"/>
I haue run the race, which it pleaſed God to appoint for me. But yet before my ſoule depart from my bodie, and before I doe leaue you, one thing there is of which I hold it expedient now to admoniſh and aduertiſe you, as I haue alwayes vſed in caſes of importance, when I was able in former times, and in the better yeares of my age. And that is, That as heretofore during my life time, euen till now, you haue endured all trauels and labours euen to the laſt gaſpe, for the ſafetie and dignitie of the Chriſtian religion and the Catholique faith, by meanes whereof you haue made all the Princes of Chriſtendome to fauour, honour, and admire you: euen ſo hereafter when I am dead and gone, let that be the onely and the whole deſire of your hearts, let that be the onely thing that you ſhall ſet before your eyes. All things (I can aſſure you) will fall out eaſie and happily vnto you, as long as you continue ſtedfaſt in concord and vnitie (by which ſmall things and contemptible do grow great and inuincible) and as long as you entertaine mutuall loue and fidelitie: and that you doe make litle account of all other things in compariſon of the common profit and general good of all of you. For there is no Empire ſo puiſſant &amp; ſo well grounded, which falleth not to preſent ruine<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> and declineth not to deſtruction, where mutual enmities &amp; diſſentions are ſuffered to haue an entrie, and where priuate profit and particular commoditie is preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the publique and common good. But if you ſhall ioyne together as brethren and friendes, and ſhall liue one with another in perfect loue and amitie: no attempts nor practiſes of your enemies whatſoeuer ſhall be able to grieue or hurt you. Your Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and your crownes ſhall be durable and permanent, and you ſhall maintaine your peoples, your Prouinces, your wiues, your children, and your riches in quietneſſe, and in perpetuall felicitie. You ſhall not neede to feare the furie of the <hi>Ottoman,</hi> nor the rage of the Barbarians: their fraudes, ſubtilties, traines, and cunning ſleights, ſhall not be able to harme you nor to preuaile againſt you. Doubt you not but the tirant doth ſeeke to diſioyne you, and to diſunite your forces, he doth lay many plots and deuiſes, he is verie watchfull and vigilant, he doth ſpare no paines nor labour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide and ſeperate you: which if he can once bring to paſſe, and doe ſee you neuer ſo litle at variance, he will oppreſſe you one after another, and in the end he will vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroy and conſume all of you. Moreouer (my good friendes and confederates) there is <hi>Iohn</hi> my ſonne, whom with all poſſible care, affection and diligence (as har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely as a father can doe) I do recommend vnto you. I doe commit, I do giue and de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dicate him to your faith and fidelitie, and to your ſingular vertue. His tender yeares and the infirmitie of his age which is yet (as it were) ſtuttering and ſtammering, do make him vnfit either to foreſee or to repulſe the imminent calamitie: he is not able to preſerue himſelfe from being torne-in pieces and deuoured by thoſe fierce &amp; enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Tigers: to keepe himſelfe from being oppreſſed by that periured &amp; common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who is of him and his kingdome ſo greedie and deſirous, that he ceaſeth not to watch continually, how he may ſwallow vp both in his bloudy &amp; cruell throt. And (alas) he will worke it, he will effect it, he will oppreſſe him poore wretch: if your armes, if your valour do not protect and preſerue him. For aſſoone as he ſhall perceiue that I am dead, the cruell tirant will not make any ſtay at all, but he will come flying as a ſauage and wilde beaſt, to the intent he may reuenge ſo many loſſes, ſo many outrages and calamities which he hath ſuffred and endured by the father, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the poore and vnhappie infant: and to the intent he may execute vpon him (ſilly wretch) all kindes of cruelties, and whatſoeuer his barbarous and felonous heart can put in practiſe. Let me therefore (my louing friends and good companions) entreate you, to embrace his eſtate and his affaires with like loue, fidelitie and promptnes of affection, as I haue embraced your commoditie and your glorie, all the dayes of my
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:13368:253"/>
life, if you liſt to acknowledge the truth of that which I now ſpeake. For you know I haue not liued to my ſelfe alone, but for all you and your children: I haue ſo laboured &amp; toyled my ſelfe, that day nor night I haue not ſpared any paines or trauels for your ſakes. In the whole courſe of my life, I haue not enioyed any time or ſpace of reſt or leaſure, I neuer had any place certaine, I neuer kept any houres nor time limitted to eate and drinke, or to ſleepe in: the nights and the dayes haue bene to me all one and alike: I tooke no leſſe care for the proſperitie of your eſtates then of mine owne: and God is my witneſſe, (for now that I am fallen into ſpeech of that matter, I will freely diſcouer my thoughts vnto you) I neuer dreamed nor meant any fraud or deceipt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, but I did alwaies repute you, not as ſouldiers, as ſeruants, or as ſubiectes, but I haue euer helde and loued you as my brethren and companions. Not any one of you (as farre as I remember) was euer wronged or outraged by me in word or in deed. In all cares and ſeruices of the field, in all duties either of ſcouts, watches, or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels, I was neuer inferior to any of you: but I haue ſtill borne my ſelfe as one of the moſt ſimple and meaneſt of my ſouldiers: hauing alwaies had a deſire to be followed and imitated in my deedes and actions, and not in my wordes or ſpeeches: and that my ſouldiers ſhould learne by me, not onely good order and diſcipline, but the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and imitation thereof alſo. I neuer refuſed any labour, hazard or perill: I neuer made excuſes by any ſhewes of vnwillingnes or diſſimulation: whenſoeuer the onſet was to be giuen vpon the enemie (be it ſpoken without enuie) I was one of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in going againſt them, and one of the laſt in returning from the combat. The ſpoiles and bootie gotten vpon our enemies, I alwaies ſhared and deuided amongſt you, and neuer reſerued any part or portion thereof to my ſelfe. In briefe, euen my realme, my goods, my fortune, and all that I had, I held in common with you. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was proper or peculiar to my ſelfe, I held: nothing deuided or in ſeuerall. And now (my companions, my friendes) behold I die, I leaue you, and I muſt goe hence. Wherefore I pray and requeſt all of you, I require and adiure you: that the faith, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and loue which was neuer wanting on my part towards you: the ſame you would beſtow and employ towards <hi>Iohn</hi> my ſonne, whom as the liuely image and reſemblance of the father, I offer and dedicate vnto you, as Vicar and Lieutenant for me and in my ſtead.</q>

            <p>Hauing ended this ſpeech, he cauſed likewiſe the young Prince his ſonne to be ſent for: to whom being come, he vſed ſome ſpeeches in the preſence of the Queene his mother, exhorting him ſweetly and louingly in this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <q>My ſonne: <hi>Iohn</hi> my ſonne: thou ſeeſt that I now die, and that I leaue thee but a<note place="margin">Speeches and laſt wordes of Scanderbeg to his ſonne before his death.</note> child, an infant, young and tender: behold I leaue thee a Realme and Kingdome, if thou be good and vertuous, ſtable and firme: if thou be otherwiſe, moſt weake and feeble. Studie therefore (my ſonne) and ſtriue to preferre goodnes and vertue, before all other goods whatſoeuer. For thereby thou ſhalt both maintaine &amp; make thy eſtate not onely peaceable and quiet, but thou ſhalt encreaſe it daily, and make it more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious: but for as much (my ſonne) as thy age is yet weake, vnapt, and vnable to ſway the Scepter and Crowne of this thy kingdome, for that thou haſt on all partes great and mightie enemies, moſt fierce and ſauage beaſtes, which will ſeeke to diſmember and to deuour thee. There is <hi>Mahomet</hi> that wicked tyraunt and common enemy of Chriſtians, who (if thou ſhouldeſt ſo young and weake of yeares take vpon thee the managing and gouernment of thy Realme) would preſently oppreſſe, and vtterly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert thee: for this cauſe (ſweete heart) aſſoone as thou haſt cloſed and couered thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers eyes, and haſt yeelded this mybodie to the ſepulture, get thee preſently from hence, and taking thy mother with thee: paſſe the ſeas into <hi>Apulia,</hi> and make no

delay, but haſten to thy owne townes and Lordſhips, and ſee that thou continue and abide there, till ſuch time as thou be growen to mans eſtate, and that thou be capable and ſufficient for the affaires and gouernement of thy kingdome. When thou art come to be of yeares, make thy repaire to the noble Senate and Seigniorie of <hi>Venice,</hi> who will reeſtabliſh thee in the ſeate and throne of thy aunceſtors. For that now I leaue and commit thee to their gouernment, fidelitie, and tutorſhip to the intent they may vndertake the garde and cuſtodie of thy kingdome, and may defend it from the enemie, and may keepe it to thy vſe and benefite. For ſo are the conuentions and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of agreement betwene the <hi>Venetians</hi> and me, that they ſhall preſerue thy eſtate from thy enemies, and reſerue it for thee: and that when thou ſhalt be able to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the charge thereof, they ſhall reinueſt thee in the poſſeſſion of the ſame. I haue no doubt of their diligence in thy affaires conſidering that they only amongſt all the Princes of Chriſtendome (be it ſpoken without offence) are not inferiour to any in grauitie, prudence, and worthy exploits: beſides that for the excellencie of their faith and bountie they do merit and deſerue to be beloned and reuerenced aboue all others. Of the which I haue had good triall and experience more then any others, during the whole time of my raigne and life, in all ſorts of actions, and by the proofe of many matters: and they haue beene continually leagued and confederated with me in ſtrict friendſhip and amitie, and I haue alwaies found them in ſtead of kind and louing pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents vnto me. Them therefore (my ſonne) doe I leaue to be as Parents, as Princes, as Tutors vnto thee: depart not from their inſtructions, precepts, and counſels. The <hi>Venetians</hi> only are the moſt iuſt, the moſt religious, the moſt conſtant tutors and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of the Chriſtians faith, the protectors of Orphans and widdowes, and of all weake, miſerable, and afflicted perſons: and therewithall, they haue ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſo good and aſſured friendes vnto me, that all my life long I haue had their Seigniorie in no leſſe regard and recommendation then mine owne kingdome and Dominions. And they againe haue had ſuch confidence in me, and haue ſo affected me, that they haue put the whole right and full diſpoſition of their townes and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories into my hands, and haue referred the gouernment of them to my diſcretion: and (I praiſe God) I haue maintained them in good and happie eſtate, and haue kept them to their good liking and contentment, as long as I had the charge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of them. Wherefore (my good ſonne) thou maieſt liue ſafe and ſecure vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhadow and ſupport of their puiſſance, and when thou ſhalt be of age, fayle not to reſort vnto them, with a good courage and confidence. For they will gladly and willingly repoſſeſſe thee of thy crowne and dignitie, they will friendly and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly reſtore thy Realme and ſtrong holdes vnto thee, and if thou be ſage, wiſe, and vertuous, they will continually maintaine and defende thee againſt all the violence, armes, and forces of any enemies: they will keepe thy eſtate whole &amp; entire for thee, as moſt puiſſant, moſt ſage, and moſt inuincible Princes both by ſea and lande, and ſuch as neuer abandoned their faithfull friends and allies, nor neuer abuſed or decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued any perſon that put their truſt and affiance in them. And whenſoeuer (my ſonne the ioy of my heart) thou ſhalt returne and be ſeated in thy roiall throne, and that it ſhall pleaſe God to giue thee the quiet and peaceable poſſeſſion thereof, and that thou ſhalt haue taken vpon thee the gouernement and managing of thy eſtate: principally and aboue all things ſee that thou doe adminiſter and yeeld iuſtice to all men indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently,<note place="margin">Precepts of Scanderbeg to his ſonne for the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of a Prince.</note> for of all vertues ſhe is the moſt noble and moſt excellent: keepe and obſerue equity without any acceptance or difference of the faces of poore or rich, of the weake or mightie: vſe temperance and moderation in all thy actions, ſtrengthen thy realme with friendſhip and amitie of good men: for neither are great treaſures, nor ſtrong

armies, the garriſon or fortreſſe of eſtates and Empires: but true and faithfull friends, which are not to be gotten with ſiluer and golde, but are purchaſed with good offices of courteſie, kindneſſe, and fidelitie. And therefore that diuine ſpeech of king <hi>Philip</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Saying of Philip of Macedon to his ſonne A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander.</note> reprehending the great <hi>Alexander</hi> his ſonne, is yet extant in record: what motion (quoth he) hath induced thee my ſonne, to this vaine hope, to thinke or ſurmiſe that they will continue faithfull and truſtie vnto thee, whom thou haſt purchaſed for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to be thy friends? It is loue, that muſt yeeld true and vnfeigned friendſhip. For as this earth on which we liue, doth deſire aboue all things the preſence and comfort of the ſunne, which we ſee in the heauens: ſo the life of man cannot be without friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe and amitie. Thou therefore my ſonne ſhalt ſoone get and purchaſe all theſe things, if thou beleeue and follow my counſell: thou ſhalt draw vnto thee, thou ſhalt binde vnto thee all the world by thy benefits, if thou obſerue my precepts and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements.<note place="margin">Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence.</note> For courteſie, beneficence, and bountie, are the only vertues, accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, pleaſing to men, ſure and ſecure in all places, exempted from all perils, and they doe engender and ſtirre vp in the ſpirits and minds of men a wonderfull and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable loue and liking of them, eaſily ſurmounting &amp; exceeding all other vertues, and excelling farre beyond them: they onely (by the teſtimonie and conſent of the ſage and wiſe) are the moſt neceſſarie vertues for all kinds, eſtates, and degrees of men: but eſpecially for Princes and great perſonages: for they be the vertues which haue the commaund and poſſeſſion of the affections and humors of euery man, and they onely haue the diſpoſing of the hearts of all men. Moreouer my ſonne, in aduerſitie, and in things that are high and difficult, I would aduertiſe thee to be magnanimous and valiant: in proſperitie remember that thou moderate and temper thy good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune with vertue.

Suffer not thy ſouldiers to lie idle, or to be ſlouthfull, but exerciſe them in continuall trauell, watchings, and daily labours. Howbeit vſe them not as vaſſals and ſeruants, but as thy fellowes and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. In the campe and in the field demeane thy ſelfe not onely as a Captaine, but as a ſouldier alſo: aboue all things abhorre delicacie, and flie luxuriouſneſſe and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencie: for by theſe, the moſt ſtout and ſtrongeſt men haue growen faint and effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. Too much ſeueritie and crueltie auoide equally and alike, for they are proper to fierce and ſauage beaſts: be patient of labour without wearineſſe: and let not any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils make thee learefull or timorous: the varietie and change of thy affaires, doe thou moderate with prudence and magnanimitie, the croſſe accidents of contrarie fortune ſee that thou endure and beare them with that wiſedome and diſcretion, that (diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and concealing thy griefe) thy enemie haue no cauſe to glorie or triumph ouer thee, nor to inſult at thy calamitie. For what can be more vnfitting and vnbeſeeming the conſtancie of a braue Chieftaine, and Generall of an armie, then that his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſhould diſcouer the paſſion of his heart? Be not forgetfull but beare it alwaies in mind, that thou foreſee and eſchew the traines and ſnares of the Barbarians, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Turkes make an ordinarie and principall profeſſion: ſhunne the periurie, the cautels, and guilefull ſleights of this faithleſſe Nation; diſdaine their amitie, and let the friendſhippe and ſocietie of this diſloyall tyrant be abhominable vnto thee: neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and contemne his giftes and preſents, his flatteries, and his promiſes, for feare leaſt in drawing and alluring thee to truſt him, he doe oppreſſe thee vnawares, and caſt thee downe headlong into perpetuall and endleſſe miſchieues.

It is a thing incredible to report the exceeding teares and lamentations made both by the Prouince of <hi>Albany</hi> and the countries neere adioyning, and in diuerſe other places of Chriſtendome. His bodie being there entombed, did reſt in peace, till the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of <hi>Mahomet</hi> into <hi>Epyre</hi> to the ſiege of <hi>Scutarie</hi> which was about foure yeares after. At which time the Turkes hauing gotten the towne of <hi>Liſſa,</hi> did with a vehement and earneſt deſire ſearch out the bodie of <hi>SCanderbeg:</hi> and hauing found it, they drew it foorth of the ſupulture,<note place="margin">The bodie of Scanderbeg ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of his ſepulture and highly honored and admired by the Turkes.</note> and (it may be ſome diuine diſpenſation working that motion in them) they tooke a ſingular pleaſure and contentment to ſee it, to reuerence it, and in a manner to adore it being now dead and diſſolued, which being a liue they ſo greatly redoubted and ſtood in feare of, that the onely brute and ſound of his name did make them to flie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way confounded and aſtoniſhed. They ranne thither from all partes, flocking toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in troupes and companies with ſo greedie and vehement a deſire and longing to ſee his bones, that happie was he which might come to touch them, or but to haue a ſight of them onely: but much more glad and ioyfull was he that could get or cary away any peece of his bodie were it neuer ſo litle: and thoſe that had any part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, cauſed the ſame moſt religiouſly to be ſet and curiouſly enchaſed, ſome in ſiluer, ſome in golde, bearing it about them vpon ſome part of their bodies as a thing moſt holy, diuine and fatall: and they did with ſingular reuerence and deuotion obſerue and keepe it very carefully: being fully perſwaded, that all ſuch as did beare thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques about them, ſhould enioy the like fortune, felicitie and priuiledge during their liues which <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> (by the gift and grace of God) onely and alone within the memorie of man, had vſed and enioyed all his life time.</p>
            <p>It may be, that the Turkes were induced to be of this minde, and were drawen to<note place="margin">Certaine pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate acts and exploits done by Scanderbeg moſt rare and memorable.</note> this perſwaſion, by reaſon of many ſtrange and wonderfull reportes, that went of the rare ſtrength and corporall force and vigour of this worthie perſonage, amongſt many notable examples, making ſhew thereof one was, vppon a ſauage and wilde Bull whoſe extreame fierceneſſe, and huge greatneſſe made him fearefull to all the inhabitants dwelling in the lands and countrie of <hi>Mamiſa</hi> ſiſter to <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> where this furious beaſt did a thouſand outrages and dammages and committed many moſt<note place="margin">Scanderbeg killeth a wilde Bull in Epyre.</note> pitifull and cruell murthers: inſomuch that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> comming where he haunted and ſetting vpon him on horſebacke, with one onely blow of his Cimitarie, he cut
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:13368:255"/>
his necke cleane from his ſhoulders. The like exploit was that which he did vpon a<note place="margin">Scanderbeg killeth a wilde Bore in Apulia</note> monſtrous Boare in <hi>Apulia,</hi> which had made many of the Courtiers of King <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> to beare his markes: neuertheleſſe <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> being one day on hunting with the King, in the open and plaine field encountered with this beaſt, where aſſayling him in the ſame ſort as he had done the former, he ſoone parted the head from the bodie. This alſo is reported of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> that after the death of <hi>Ballaban,</hi> and the diſcamping of his armie from the ſiege of <hi>Croy: Ionima</hi> and <hi>Heder</hi> the brother and Nephew of <hi>Ballaban</hi> being brought before him ſtreight tyed and bound together, the<note place="margin">Ionima and Heder ſlaine by Scanderbeg &amp; cut in twaine with one blow.</note> ſight and preſence of thoſe two (putting him in remembrance of <hi>Ballaban,</hi> and the crueltie which by his meanes was executed vpon the perſons of <hi>Moſes</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions) did cauſe him to enter into ſo great a vehemencie of wrath and choller a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them: that not ſtaying for any other to lay hand vpon them, he deuided them in two pieces, and with one only blow parted both their bodies a ſunder in the midſt. This Cimitary was made at <hi>Damaſco</hi> in <hi>Siria,</hi> it was of a moſt perfect goodneſſe and excellent temper: and many times he would beare two of them in one ſcabbard both of the which ſometimes he ſhould breake in one onely battell. This weapon was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally reputed ſo rare and excellent, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> on a time hauing heard thereof,<note place="margin">Mahomet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg his ſword in gift.</note> that it would cut helmets, head peeces, and powdrons cleane a ſunder: one day when they were in truce together he ſent vnto him, demaunding this ſworde to be giuen him; which being graunted, and proofe being made thereof in the preſence of the <hi>Sultan</hi> by many of the ſtrongeſt &amp; ableſt men of his Court, and ſuch as were thought to haue the beſt arme: but perceiuing none of theſe wonders and miracles that had bene reported of it, he ſent it backe againe vnto <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> in great ſcorne and <q>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine,<note place="margin">Speach or meſſage of Mahomet vnto Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning his ſword againe vnto him.</note> with this meſſage, That he would not be beholding vnto him for ſuch a thing as he could get for his money, and which ſhould be of much greater and better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: and that he did not giue any credite to any of thoſe reports that had bene gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen out touching the excellencie of that ſword. But <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> in the ſight and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the meſſenger,</q> hauing made ſtrange and admirable prooues with this ſame Cimitarie willed him to tell his Lord and Maſter what he had ſeene, and withall to <q>

            </p>
            <p>But to make an ende of this worke, I could here adde many reportes of like qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, which are written of the force and wonderfull diſpoſition of the bodie of <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg,</hi> exceeding perhaps the common courſe and law of nature, and which would hardly be credited or beleeued: but I will let them paſſe and not ſpeake of them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that we might with as good reaſon and aſwell enlarge our conſciences, and giue credite vnto them, as to thoſe which are reported of elder times, and which antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hath commended vnto vs: the which neuertheleſſe euen at this day we doe cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate and greatly ſet by; as the labours of <hi>Hercules,</hi> the aduentures of <hi>Iaſon,</hi> of <hi>Perſeus,</hi> of <hi>Caſtor,</hi> of <hi>Pollux,</hi> of <hi>Bellerophon,</hi> of <hi>Hector,</hi> of <hi>Achilles,</hi> with infinite other moſt famous and heroicall perſonages, whoſe glorie is not bounded nor confined within any ſtraighter limits, then the large and ſpacious circuit and compaſſe of the wide worlde: and yet notwithſtanding we haue no other proofe of their exploites, nor any certaintie of the actes aſcribed to thoſe auncient Princes, but onely the bare pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the time and the tradition of our forefathers, which haue admitted them for true beyond time out of memorie. But the truth of theſe wonderfull matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> doth carie greater ſhew of likelihood and probabilitie: for (to omit thoſe two thundering tempeſts of warre <hi>Hunyades</hi> and his ſonne <hi>Mathias Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinus</hi>

King of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> who liued in the time of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> and of whom are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported as great and ſtrange matters) we may ſee in <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> a pure worke of the finger of God, and the euident aſſiſtance of his diuine hand and power, for the ſuccor and reliefe of his Church and choſen people: in that it pleaſed him to raiſe vpper his worthie and Chriſtian Prince, and to endow him with ſo many ſpeciall prerogatiues as another <hi>Dauid</hi> againſt theſe two <hi>Goliaths, Amurath</hi> and <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the moſt cruell and bloudie perſecutors of the houſe and Church of God that euer liued.
