            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Honour'd <hi>ALEXANDER POPHAM,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHEN I reflect upon the vast Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that inrich the Souls of Poets, and the unlimited Power of Poetry it self; how (by a Noble Conversation with the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Labours of Antiquity) they turn the Glass of Time, and make it often run the Golden Age agén; Poetry, whose almost Creating Pow'r, out-strips the slower Race of Nature, to the forming, if possible, of Worlds unknown, and animating even Beings yet Unborn. And if Oblivion, the sole Death of Merit, shoots her ill-aim'd Arrows at the Memory of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and Noble Actions in vain; 'tis only, when they are guarded by such a Quill, whilst Deathless Worth stands transmitted to latest Ages by such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording Hands.</p>
            <p>When I consider this, I am obliged (so poor my weak pretensions) to renounce the Name of Poet, so far from being intituled to any legitimate Favours from
<pb facs="tcp:52466:3"/>
any one of the Fair Inspirers, that I have rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a barbarous Rape upon the whole Nine.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, when my too daring Confidence enboldens me, to lay this homely piece at your Feet; whatever I may hope from your own pardoning Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, how will the World forgive me such a presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? However, as self-preservation, my only Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, has induced me to the Affixing so Great a Name to so worthless a Trifle, for borrowing the Umbrage of so Generous a Protectour: Believe me, Sir, that enter'd under your Honourable Roof, I survey such infinite Merits shine before me. But here let my Unhallow'd Pen advance no farther; 'tis enough my Veneration strikes me silent. And indeed such High Desert, is as much above the want of a Panegyrick, as I am unworthy the writing it. Not, Sir, that such conspicuous Virtues are unknown, but that I am known too much. The greatest justice therefore I can do your Memory, is to let your Name be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, and let this Presumption tell Posterity, that nothing could awe a Player into Modesty.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, to speak a word of this undeserving Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring that begs your Patronage. It is a common vanity amongst Dramatick Writers, to ascribe that Approbation which often is due alone to the Actors, to the Merit of their Pen, when one Man's Grimace
<pb facs="tcp:52466:3"/>
shall sometimes betray an Audience into a general Applause; and thus no one can be sure he is inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of Errors, till some Impartial Iudge has heard his Cause.</p>
            <p>As the unexpected success of this Play does not add much, so neither does it take from its worth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is as yet unsentenc'd, and tho' perhaps its Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors may condemn it, 'tis possible, a free Confession may gain half its Pardon: If your Goodness can forgive my Presumption in this Dedication, the World will pardon the Errors of the Play, since I send it abroad, under the Protection of so Honourable a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron. To whose Eternal Service, I Dedicate both This and my Self.</p>

            <l>I'm come, being his Friend and Fellow Play'r,</l>

            <byline>Spoken by Mrs. <hi>Knight.</hi>
            </byline>
            <l>TRoth, Gentlemen, there's such an Itch in Scribling,</l>
            <l>That even our puny Whisler must be nibbling.</l>
            <l>What though he had seen what stronger Pens had writ,</l>
            <l>With all the Nerves of Sense, and Brawn of Wit,</l>
            <l>His Pigmey Muses narrower Dimensions,</l>
            <l>To that vast Bulk, have no such fair Pretensions.</l>
            <l>Well, then, for our small Poet, what Defence?</l>
            <l>Troth, none at all. He owns his Impudence:</l>
            <l>And if he thought 'twou'd do him any good,</l>
            <l>He vows he wou'd be Modest, if he cou'd:</l>
            <l>Swears he wou'd blush, with all the signs of Grace,</l>
            <l>Only a Blush wou'd spoil his Players Face,</l>
            <l>And that were a sad mortifying Case.</l>
            <l>But hang't, for once, good Sirs, let his Play hit,</l>
            <l>And, if 'tis possible, allow him Wit:</l>
            <l>Not that he has it, only you must know</l>
            <l>That Wit goes a great way to make a Beau.</l>
            <l>Nor can you guess how pressing an Occasion</l>
            <l>He has for such a spruce Qualification.</l>
            <l>For could he once write Beau, Oh the fine things,</l>
            <l>Laces, and Linnen, Points, and Cravat strings,</l>
            <l>Would all come trouling in, a Lumping Bargain,</l>
