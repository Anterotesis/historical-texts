            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>APollo</hi> was a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man rather then a Physician, and yet both: I apply to you for coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell in my malady, as a Clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall Compeere with <hi>Hermes</hi>

and <hi>Asclepius.</hi> A whole au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne of hypocondraical passions and symptomes are fallen upon me, which is a melancholy disease, and must be handled gently with preparatives; for the humour is sturdy, and violence will rent and destroy all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick. The cause proceeds from a surfeit: Of reading men and books.</p>
               <p>I have read over your <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids Metamorphosis</hi>; at first view I took it to be a heape of sand without cement, all independent; but upon the review, I take it to be the best piece of a School boy that hath well laboured and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57283:3"/>
beaten out only two theams. The first, <hi>Ante obitum nemo</hi>—which takes up the whole first half part of the infelicity of <hi>Agenors Progenie.</hi> The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part,—<hi>Nihil est toto quod perstet in orbe.</hi> Where the mutations and vicissitude of things are summarily enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate.</p>
               <p>I have lately read <hi>Balzac,</hi> where I have been set upon the rack and torture, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting some high conceit, and never more delighted, then when I most failed, admiring with others what I least understood. His Letters to the Cardinall and Bishop seems to be a piece of <hi>Davids</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:57283:4"/>
Psalmes conferd upon man for the most excellent piece; to be a Courtier, is to be something prophane. His love letters to <hi>Clorinda</hi> sound as if they were translated out of some old Ballads, only lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out the counterpit play, the Ging of <hi>Rime.</hi> I do passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately disaffect that trite ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solete valedure; your most humble, your tres humble and affectionate Servant, it seemes like the overworne Statute lace of your Groome or Footman, and best befits them. In all his Letters like <hi>Lipsius,</hi> or Sir <hi>Henry Wotton,</hi> ever grumbling and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of his invalitude.</p>

made a Survay of all the Gentlemens houses, and without a pack of Cards last <hi>christmas</hi> plaid alone. I see one a general good house-keeper for a very age, he keeps hospitality, payes his servants wages quarterly: But what's the <hi>Catastrophe</hi>? He dies, his servants have spent their Wages for their Masters honour, and their own reputation; when they be dissolved, an habitual idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness brings povertie, miserie. An other runns in debt unto his servants; but at the close weakens, almost ruines his own estate; here are objects of piety; pitie I can not, I am
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57283:5"/>
not yet so weak. An other out of an ample soul, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded liberal Disposition, flies into high exorbitances, vast expenses, but fore-seeing the future inconvenience breaks o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>And who gets the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage? the Country Farmer will tell you, these great house-keepers bring all the beggars in a Region to his parts, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57283:6"/>
continual clamours at our doores. Your private Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman finds the price of provision raised to a third part, and therein suffers. And for my part, I am as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to lie in a great Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans house as in an Inn, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the abatement of my content, for I had rather be observed, then observe the will of an other.</p>
               <p>If I look upon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieman, he's no other to me then one that's borne some thousand leagues out of Christendome, or rather men moving like trees: and if I breath a gentle gale of a good morrow, they will move and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57283:6"/>
bend with a soft murmur. If I tread upon a doggs taile by chance, he will turne back and bite.</p>
               <p>In these lumpish passions I have some pleasing Intervals, I can both laugh and sleepe. I take a merry book into my hand, say it be that <hi>Mortuum Caput,</hi> old <hi>Aristotle</hi> his <hi>Organon</hi> in the bare Latine text. Oh! how I can chink at his pretty Conceits; the burden of all his merry catches is, <hi>Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium enim est.</hi> I have an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther better remedie to my malady; I take a piece of that <hi>Astaticke</hi> redundance under mine elbow, <hi>Galen de tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis</hi> or his <hi>Commentaries</hi>

                  <hi>Protestant.</hi> I faithfully sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and copied out with mine own eyes and hands the proofes from the Authors themselves. But the terme of mine intention was this; I'me thoroughly perswaded that none of the first 600. Centurists knew either <hi>Papist</hi> or <hi>Protestant,</hi> as questions not at all questioned at those times. And therefore I will neither appeal to them as judges or advocates or wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses: But like unto Pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on feathers of which the <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> write, the causes of the variegations and diversity of lustres proceeds from the contrary lights, or lookings

through <hi>Mediums</hi> diversly tincted: diversity of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and discrepancie of the first principles instilled into each man begets a pertinacy in Paradoxes; In these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies, the disputant and Latter writers wrest the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to their own appetite, making them like a Bell to sound as they please to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret, or like the indented <hi>Ianuary</hi> tablets which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents two several figures at several stations, like change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able taffeties or <hi>Marmoles</hi> in a decaying fire, every one phansies his own Phantasms.</p>

            <p>MY dearest <hi>Iunctino,</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, in a manner, out of the Pale of Christendome, where I only see men wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king like trees, I wearied my self with close scrutinie into the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:57283:43"/>In the first place I found this decay to proceed from want of flattery. Mistake me not! Adulation is a general terme for complacency, and blandishment (so saies our great Master of the Summes) To commend a man, if not according to what he is, yet according to that he should be: not so much to praise him, as to provoke him to make himself worthy of such praise. To delight a man disconsolate with a tender collubencie least he faint in tribulation, these are an act of friendship, a laudable virtue which we call <hi>Eutrapelia, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi> affability; Society and conversation cannot subsist
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57283:43"/>
without delight. If <hi>Eutrapelia</hi> after the <hi>Ephesian Dialect</hi> be taken in the worser sense, let <hi>Eucharistia</hi> take place, a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful recordation of good turns</p>

He is the light of his nation and the Christian world; the Exemplar of Sanctity, the Salt of the people, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the Church. Nay, if you find him in a Tavern or a Brothel house, Saint <hi>Mary Mawdlin</hi> must be converted: and our Saviour frequented the assemblies of Publicanes and sinners, Nay! their Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is so full of Deities, that you may finde sooner God then a man amongst them.

They ascribe larger Horizons then their Circumscription requires, and the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them with amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more then a reality will well admit.

            <p>Now review what <hi>stigma's</hi> they have for the Adversary the <hi>Protestant.</hi> If a temperate man, you shall find his judgement faint, obscure, imperfect, all his expressions want Sunshine.

            <p>Run over with me now the other extreme, what a blandishment and Palliation they have for their rude and horrid absurdities. If he have a confident presuming garrulity, such as play a <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi> gigg upon the <hi>Scotch</hi>
