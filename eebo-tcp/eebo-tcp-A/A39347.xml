            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:31428:4"/>
Exemplar of Royal For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and Christian Patience, who so Gloriously lay'd down his Life for the Preservation of a <hi>Pure Conscience</hi> from the Polu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Perjury, in Violating his Oath to maintain the Laws of this Kingdom, particularly those, that Concern the Church, the Matter of those Laws being most Agreeable to His Judgment, so that He Knew it would have been His Duty to have Desir'd that such Laws should have been Made in his Time, if they had not been Made before He came to the Throne: So Unreasonable, so Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conscionable, so Trayterous, so <hi>Diabolical</hi> was it for LUDLOW, and his Companions to Urge Him to the Abrogation of those Laws, and at length to Murther Him for Adhering to the Dictates of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:31428:5"/>
so <hi>Pure a Conscience.</hi> Oh, My Dear Brethren, hearken I beseech you, to these words of Our Persecuted, Our MURTHER'D SOVERAIGN, whose Bloud will most certainly Cry for Vengeance against this whole Nation, if the <hi>Approbation</hi> of the Shedding of it (which God Forbid) should ever become a <hi>National Sin,</hi> through the Instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the DEVIL, By such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments as LUDLOW. Thus speaks this Mirroir of Royal Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in his Discourse concerning <q>The Differences between the King, and the Two Houses in point of Church-Government. As to My particular engagement above other men, by an Oath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to My Judgment, I am solemnly oblig'd to preserve that Government, and the Rights of the Church.</q>

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:31428:5"/>
               <q>I have oft wonder'd how men pretending to tenderness of Conscience, and Reformation, can at once tell Me that My Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation Oath binds Me to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to whatsoever they shall propound to Me (which they urge with such violence) tho contrary to all that Rational, and Religious freedome which every man ought to preserve; and of which they seem so ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in their own Votes; yet at the same time these men will needs perswade Me, That I must and ought to dispence with, and roundly break that part of My Oath, which binds Me (agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the best light of Reason and Religion I have) to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Government, and Legal Rights of the Church. Yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Rack chiefly have I been
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:31428:6"/>
held so long, by some mens am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Covetousness, and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious Cruelty; torturing (with Me) both Church and State, in Civil dissentions; till I shall be forced to consent, and declare that I do approve, what (God knows) I utterly dislike, and in My Soul abhor, as many ways highly against Reason, Justice, and Religion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I shall not undertake to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with History in this Paper farther than what concerns A. B. LAUD, and B. MOUNTAGUE. By the <hi>Notoriety</hi> of the Falsehood of LUDLOW'S Reflections upon Them, any man may Judge what Credit is to be given to him in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Matters. How Prodigiously False his Charge against <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague</hi> is, I have shown in My Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Entitled, A <hi>Vindication</hi> of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:31428:6"/>
the Honour of King Charles the First. It is certainly to the Praise and not to the Dishonour of A. B. <hi>Laud</hi> what this <hi>Regicide</hi> Truly Reports of Him <hi>p.</hi> 9. <q>
                  <hi>Laud</hi> sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited the King to shelter <hi>Mountague</hi> from the Prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Commons, and upon the occasion of that Prosecution said, <hi>I seem to see a Cloud arising, and threatning the Church of England, God for his Mercy dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate it.</hi>
               </q> The words following, tho He design'd by them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the King, do most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly tend to his Eternal Praise in that He saw the Resplendent Merit of that wonderful Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man, tho Overcast with the Mists of so much Obloquy and and Publick Reproach. <q>The King appear'd incensed at the Prosecution, and sent a Message
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:31428:7"/>
to the <hi>Commons,</hi> that <hi>Mountague</hi> was his <hi>Chaplain,</hi> and he had taken the business into his own hands: he afterwards granted him a <hi>Pardon</hi> of all Offences, and made him Bishop of <hi>Chichester.</hi>
               </q> Well, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> and what then? Most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly for fo doing this Blessed Prince, throughout all Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, shall have the Praise of all Learned Men that read the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Writings of this excellent Prelate, and are themselves as he was, stedfast, and Judicious Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries of the grossest Errors of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to Vindicate all his opinions, but I can prove that the Errors of his most <hi>Confident</hi> Adversaries were far worse than the worst of His. <hi>p.</hi> 15. This State-Sophister falls again upon A. B. <hi>Laud,</hi> 
               <q>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Laud,</hi> says he, took <hi>Sib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:31428:7"/>
into his Bosome, and that he might undermine Good Old <hi>Abbot,</hi> whose Bishoprick he Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted, he put it into the Kings head to require the Arch-Bishop to Licence <hi>Sibthorp'</hi>s Sermon — The good Old Man persisted in his Refusal.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whose Bishoprick He Coveted!</hi> This he can never prove to be True, unless he can Prove himself to have a Faculty of searching the hearts of Men. I can hardly think that LUDLOW himself could believe that so Wise a Man as B. <hi>Laud</hi> could be so Silly in any thing, as to conceit that A. B. <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot</hi> should have been put to Death or depriv'd of his Arch-Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick (that it might be confer'd on him) for refusing to Licence a Sermon.

               <hi>Formally</hi> Suspended: if he were, most certainly it was not for refusing to Licence <hi>Sib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp'</hi>s Sermon, but for that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual Homicide, which he was guilty of, concerning which, in the late <hi>History of Oxford Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> we find these words. <q>At length he being found guilty of casual homicide, Retir'd for a time to <hi>Guilford</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> the place of his Nativity, where he had erected an Hospital for Men and Women.</q> Here you see the Occasion that the <hi>Archiepiscopal Jurisdiction</hi> was committed to <hi>Five Bishops</hi> as <hi>Ludlow</hi> reports p. 16. <q>The King instantly sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended the Arch-Bishop, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Confin'd him, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Archiepiscopal Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> to Five Bishops, all of the New Church of <hi>England,</hi> and

of the <hi>Father of Lyes!</hi> Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, I beseech you, to these words of Our Gracious Soveraign speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his own Defence against this <hi>Hellish</hi> Calumny. <q>Indeed that Sea of Bloud, which hath there been cruelly and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously shed, is enough to drown any man in eternal both infamy and misery, whom God shall find the malicious Author, or Instigator of its effusion.</q>

               <q>It fell out, as a most unhappy advantage of some mens malice against me; that when they had impudence enough to lay any thing to my charge, this blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy opportunity, should be offen'd them, with which I must be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed. Although there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which could be more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred to me, being so full of Sin against God, Disloyalty to

               <q>God knows, as I can with Truth wash my hands in Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, as to any guilt in that Rebellion; so I might wash them in my Tears, as to the sad apprehensions I had, to see it spread so far, and make such waste. And this in a time when distractions and jealousies here in <hi>England,</hi> made most men ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intent to their own safety, or designs they were driving, than to the relief of those, who were every day inhumanely Butchered in <hi>Ireland:</hi> Whose tears, and bloud might, if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, have quenched, or at least for a time repressed, and smothered those sparks of Civil dissentions, and Jealousies which in <hi>England</hi> some men

most industriously scattered.</q> See, Reader, and Admire the Charity of this Blessed Prince Exprest in the Prayer he makes upon this Occasion. <q>Let the scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, and unjust Reproaches cast upon Mc, be as a breath more to kindle my compassion; Give me grace to heap charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble coals of Fire upon their heads to melt them, whose ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, or cruel zeal hath kindled, or hindred the quenching of those flames, which have so much wasted my three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</q>

I have lately seen in Print a Device to make people believe that the King was not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of <gap reason="foreign">

Bishop <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den'</hi>s Way of <hi>Thinking</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression</hi> was as Different from what we find in this Admirable Book, as the <hi>Glittering of Ice</hi> from the <hi>Shining of Diamonds;</hi> or any thing that is most <hi>Loose,</hi> and <hi>full of Air</hi> from that which is most <hi>Solid,</hi> and <hi>Compact.</hi> I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute

so much to the Wit, and Scholarly Education of LUDLOW, as to think He could not but Laugh in his Sleeve (as the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Phrase is) at the <hi>Absurdity</hi> of such a Fiction: neither can I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive but that if He would most seriously peruse all that has been Written by Our Gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign on this Subject, <hi>The Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and Troubles in Ireland,</hi> Defending his Innocency with that Strength of Reason, and Perspicuity of Expression; I say I cannot conceive but that if LUDLOW would but Read what the King has written in His own Defence, he would Condemn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, if not for his Wickedness, yet at least for his <hi>Shameful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertency</hi> in venturing upon so Notorious a piece of SATANISM, as this <hi>Hellish</hi> Calumny. Now,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:31428:11"/>
Reader, let us consider the words of the Challenge of this bold Champion of Malice and False<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, <hi>p.</hi> 27. <q>In whatsoever I have said, I have had a Due, and Faithful Regard to Truth, and do Challenge even <hi>Pelling</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self (who ought for his own Vindication to do it, if he can) to Convict me of Falsehood in any one Particular charg'd upon his INCOMPARABLE PRINCE.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I am as much Concern'd in the Challenge as Mr. <hi>Pelling,</hi> having in Many Sermons, Preacht on the Thirtieth of <hi>January,</hi> set forth the Praise of this <hi>Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Prince,</hi> (tho not with so much Eloquence) with as much Zeal, and Ardency of Love to His Blessed Memory, as any Preacher in the Kingdom: And by the Help of God I shall be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:31428:12"/>
ready to Contend with Any Man, or Any Number of Men, who shall Endeavour to Stain the Honour of so Gracious a Prince, so Sincere a Christian, a Person so Wonderfuly Adorn'd with All the Excellencies of Wit, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Virtue. Whether I have <hi>Convicted</hi> LUDLOW of any False<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, I leave to the Judgment of any Impartial Reader: And in Confidence that I have done so, I shall Conclude with these words of the <hi>Psalmist:</hi>
