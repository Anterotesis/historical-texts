            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The particular grieuances of thoſe his Maieſties ſubiects throughout England and Wales, which lye vnder the oppreſſion of <hi>George Woods Patent for the ſole printing vpon Linnen cloth.</hi>

            <p>FIrſt, in that the ſame was obtained vpon a falſe pretence, that he the ſaid <hi>Wood</hi> or one <hi>Ienkinſon</hi> (whoſe inuendon he ſaith, he hath bought) was the firſt inuenter of this Art; <note place="margin">Wood is by trade a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of bookes.</note>whereas in truth the ſaid <hi>Wood</hi> is but newly attained to any knowledge therein; and for <hi>Ienkinſon,</hi> if he had any maner of inuention therein at all<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, it was ſome very ſmall thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thirtie yeares ago, now out of vſe, which inuention he hath alſo ſold to a great number of perſons, for 2 s. 3 s. 5 s. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> s. 20 s. 40 s. or any mony that he could get, and they ſold it to others. And he hauing made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>is benefit thereof ſo many yeares, and in ſuch kind, it cannot now be taken for a new inuention, ſeeing not onely the Art it ſelfe, but alſo the apprenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and people that haue bene trained vp therein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are exceedingly increaſed, ſo that a great multitude of families both in this Cit ie and throughout the kingdome, would be impoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by the continuance of this Patent, if it ſhould hold.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the validitie of the Patent, it was in way of triall by ſuite of ſome Freemen, in the Exchequer; but vpon a Reference obtained from his Maieſtie to the Lord Chancellor and now Lord Treaſurer, vpon the falſe pretence aforeſaid, they were ſtopped, and not ſuffered to proceed to triall.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Patent is ſo generall, that it extends in preiudice to all his Maieſties ſubiects: for the goods therein prohibited, though they be bought and ſold, paid for, and paſſed from hand to hand, yet they are forfeited in whoſe hands ſoeuer.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Patentee may enter into the houſes of the Kings ſubiects, and ſeize and cary away and diſpoſe of the goods prohibited. And did execute this his power vpon ſome before this Parliament.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He hath impriſoned otherſome by colour of the ſaid Patent, ſince the Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</p>
            <p n="6">6. He pretended to the Drawers of the Citie, for his more eaſie obtaining of the Patent, and to gaine their aſſiſtance therein, great and good benefit vnto them, which Patent doth now vtterly begger them: for hee giues but a matter of 7 s. 4 d. for that worke which hee himſelfe takes 24 s.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Hee hath by colour of this Patent, entred into ſome houſes, and taken away goods not contained in the Patent.</p>
            <p n="8">8. He hath raiſed the prices of workes from 16 s. to 24 s. and by colour of the Patent may ſtill raiſe at his pleaſure.</p>
            <p n="9">9. He hath giuen out ſpeeches, that he muſt raiſe the priſes of worke: for that hee doth not onely pay 10. lib. a yeare to the King, reſerued vpon the Patent, but alſo 200. lib. a yeare to ſome other or others that procured the Patent.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The Patentee makes himſelfe hereupon ſo ſtrong, that he hath affirmed hee will not giue three pence to haue the Parliament maintaine his Patent.</p>
            <p n="11">11. He had formerly a Patent, vpon pretence the inuention was his owne, whereupon was reſerued 40 lib. <hi>per annum</hi> to his Maieſtie: and by that Patent none were prohibited to vſe the Art. Which Patent not ſeruing to his purpoſe, he then found out this new pretence (though falſe) and obtained this Patent, which is in benefit to him if it ſhould hold, aboue a hund<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
