         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>OF THE PARLIAMENT,
and the Authority thereof.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He moſt high and abſolute power of the Realme of
England conſiſteth in the Parliament. For as in
Warre where the King himſelfe in Perſon, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
the reſt of the Gentility and the Yeomanry
are, is the force and power of England: ſo in Peace
and Conſultation where the Prince is to give life,
and the laſt and higheſt Commandement: the Barrony or the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
for the higher: the Knights, Eſquires, Gentlemen and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
for the lower part of the Common-wealth, the Biſhops for
the Clergy be preſent to advertiſe, conſult, and ſhew what is good
and neceſſary for the Common-wealth, and to conſult together,
and upon mature deliberation every Bill or Law being thrice read
and diſputed upon in either Houſe, the other two parts, firſt each a
part, and after the Prince himſelfe in preſence of both the partyes
doth conſent unto, &amp; alloweth. That is the Prince's and the whole
Realmes deed: whereupon juſtly no man can complain, but muſt
accommodate himſelfe to find it good and obey it.</p>
            <p>That which is done by this conſent is called Firme, Stable, and
<hi>Sanctum,</hi> and is taken for Law. The Parliament abrogateth old
Lawes, maketh new, giveth order for things paſt, and for things
hereafter to be followed, changeth rights and poſſeſſions of private
men, legitimateth baſtards, eſtabliſheth formes of Religion, alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
waights and meaſures, giveth forme of ſucceſſion to the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105581:3"/>
Crown, defineth of doubtfull rights, whereof is no Law already
made, appoynteth Subſidies, Tailes, Taxes and impoſitions, giveth
moſt free pardons &amp; abſolutions, reſtoreth in blood &amp; name, as the
higheſt Court, condemneth or abſolveth them whom the Prince
will put to that tryall. And to be ſhort, all that ever the People of
Rome might doe, either in <hi>Centuriatis Comitiis</hi> or <hi>tributis,</hi> the
ſame may be done by the Parliament of England, which repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and hath the power of the whole Realme, both the head and
the body. For every Engliſh man is intended to be there preſent,
either in Perſon, or by Procuration, or Atturney of what Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
State, Dignity or Quality ſoever he be, from the Prince (be
he King or Queen) to the loweſt perſon of England. And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of the Parliament is taken to be every mans conſent.</p>
            <p>The Iudges in Parliament are the King or Queens Majeſty, the
Lords Temporall and Spirituall, the Commons preſented by the
Knights and Burgeſſes of every Shire and Burrough Town. Theſe
all, or the greateſt part of them, and that with the conſent of the
Prince for the time being muſt agree to the making of Lawes.</p>
            <p>The officers in Parliament are the Speakers, two Clarkes, the
one for the Higher Houſe, the other for the Lower, and Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees.</p>
            <p>The Speaker is he that doth commend and preferre the Bills ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
into the Parliament, and is the Mouth of the Parliament.
He is commonly appoynted by the King or Queen, though accepted
by the aſſent of the Houſe.</p>
            <p>The Clarkes are the keepers of the Parliament Rolles and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
and of the Statutes made, and have the cuſtody of the private
Statutes not Printed.</p>
            <p>The Committees are ſuch as either the Lords in the Higher Houſe,
or Burgeſſes in the Lower Houſe, doe chuſe to frame the Lawes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuch Billes as are agreed upon, and afterward to be ratified by
the ſame Houſes.</p>

               <head>Of the forme of holding the Parliament.</head>
               <p>THe Prince ſendeth forth His reſcripts or writs to every Duke,
Marqueſſe, Baron, and every other Lord Temporall or Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105581:3"/>
who hath voyce in the Parliament, to be at his great Councell of
Parliament ſuch a day (the ſpace from the date of the writ is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at the leaſt 40. dayes) he ſendeth alſo writs to the Sheriffes of
every Shire, to admoniſh the whole Shire to chuſe two Knights of
the Parliament in the name of the Shire, to heare, and reaſon, and to
give their advice and conſent in the name of the Shire, and to be
preſent at that day: likewiſe to every Citty and Towne, which of
ancient time hath been wont to find Burgeſſes of the Parliament, ſo
to make election that they may be preſent at the firſt day of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.
The Knights of the Shire be choſen by all the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Yeomen of the Shire, preſent at the day aſſigned for the
election <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> voyce of any abſent can be counted for none. Yeomen
I call here (as before) that may diſpend at the leaſt 40<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. of yearly
rent of free land of his own. Theſe meeting at one day, the two
who have the more of their voyces, be choſen Knights of the Shire
for that Parliament: likewiſe by the plurality of the voyces of the
Cittizens &amp; Burgeſſes, be the Burgeſses elected. The firſt day of the
Parliament the Prince and all the Lords in their Robes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
doe meet in the Higher Houſe, where after prayers made,
they that be preſent are written, and they that be abſent upon ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse,
or ſome other reaſonable cauſe, (which the Prince will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low)
doe conſtitute under their hand and Seale, ſome one of theſe
who be preſent, as their Procurer, or Atturney, to give voyce for
them, ſo that by preſence or Atturney and Proxy they be all there,
all the Princes and Barons, and all Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops, and
(when Abbots were) ſo many Abbots as had voyce in Parliament.
The place where the aſſembly is, is richly Tapeſſed and Hanged, a
Princely and Royall Throne as appertaineth to a King, ſet in the
midſt of the higher place thereof. Next under the Prince ſitteth the
Chancellor, who is the voyce and Orator of the Prince. On the
one ſide of that Houſe or Chamber, ſitteth the Arch-biſhops &amp; Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
each in his ranke; on the other ſide the Dukes and Barons.</p>
               <p>In the midſt thereof upon Woolſacks ſit the Iudges of the
Realme, the Maſter of the Rolles, and the Secretaries of State.
But theſe that ſit on the Woolſacks have no voyce in the Houſe,
but only ſit there to anſwer their knowledge in the Law, when they
be askt if any doubt ariſe among the Lords. The Secretaries doe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105581:4"/>
of ſuch Letters or things paſſed in Councell whereof they
have the cuſtody and knowledge, and this is called the Vpper
Houſe, whoſe conſent and diſſent is given by each man ſeverally,
and by himſelfe, firſt for himſelfe, and then ſeverally for as many as
he hath Letters and Proxies, when it cometh to the queſtion, ſaying
only content or not content, without farther reaſoning or replying.
In this mean time the Knights of the Shires, and Burgeſſes of the
Parliament (for ſo they are called that have voyce in Parliament,
and are Choſen as I have ſaid before to the number betwixt three
and foure Hundred) are called by ſuch as it pleaſeth the Prince to
appoynt, into an open great houſe or chamber by name, to which
they anſwer: and declaring for what Shire or Town they anſwer,
then they are willed to chooſe an able and diſcreet man, to be as it
were the mouth of them all, and to ſpeak for, and in the name of
them, and to preſent him ſo choſen by them to the Prince: which
done they comming all with him to the Barre, which is at the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end of the upper Houſe, there he firſt prayſeth the Prince, then
maketh his excuſe of inability, and prayeth the Prince that He
would command the Commons to chooſe another. The Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
in the Princes name doth ſo much declare him able, as he did
declare himſelfe unable, and thanketh the Commons for chooſing
ſo wiſe diſcreet and eloquent a man, and willeth them to goe and
conſult of Lawes for the Common-wealth. Then the Speaker
maketh certain requeſts to the Prince in the name of the Commons,
Firſt, that His Majeſty would be content, that they may uſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
all their Liberties &amp; priviledges that the Commons Houſe was
wont to injoy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that they may frankly and freely ſay their minds in
diſputing of ſuch matters as may come in queſtion, and that without
offence to His Majeſty.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if any ſhould chance of that Lower Houſe to offend, or
not to doe or ſay as ſhould become him, or if any ſhould offend any
of them being called to that His Majeſties Highneſſe Court, that
they themſelves (according to the ancient cuſtome) might have the
puniſhment of them. And fourthly, that if there came any doubt
whereupon they ſhall deſire to have the advice, or conference with
His Majeſty, or with any of the Lords, that they might doe it; all
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105581:4"/>
which he promiſeth in the Commons names, that they ſhall not
abuſe, but have ſuch regard, as moſt faithfull, true, and loving Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
ought to have to their Prince.</p>
               <p>The Chancellor anſwereth in the Princes Name as appertaineth.
And this is all that is done for one day, and ſometimes for two.
Beſides the Chancellor, there is one in the upper Houſe, who is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Clarke of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> who readeth the Bills. For all
that commeth in conſultation either in the upper Houſe, or in the
neather Houſe, is put in writing firſt in paper, which being once
read he that will, riſeth up, and ſpeaketh with it or againſt it, and ſo
one after another ſo long as they ſhall thinke good: That done, they
go to another, &amp; ſo to another Bill. After it hath been once or twice
read, and doth appeare that it is ſomewhat liked as reaſonable, with
ſuch amendment in words and peradventure ſome ſentences, as by
diſputation ſeemeth to be amended, in the upper Houſe the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
asketh, if they will have it ingroſſed, that is to ſay, put into
Parchment: which done; &amp; read the third time, and that eft-ſoones,
if any be diſpoſed to objected, diſputed againe among them, the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
asketh if they will go to the queſtion; and if they agree to go
to the queſtion, then he ſaith, here is ſuch a Law, or Act concerning
ſuch a matter, which hath been thrice read here in this Houſe, are ye
content that it be enacted or no? If the not contents be more, then
the Bill is daſhed, that is to ſay, the Law is annihilated, and goeth no
farther. If the contents be the more, then the Clarke writeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath:
<hi>Soit baille aux Commons.</hi> And ſo when they ſee time,
they ſend ſuch Bills as they have approved, by two or three of thoſe
which doe ſit on the wool-ſacks to the Commons, who asking li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
and comming into the houſe with due reverence, ſaith to the
ſpeaker: Maiſter ſpeaker, my Lords of the upper Houſe, have paſſed
among them, and thinke good that there ſhould be enacted by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
ſuch an Act, &amp; ſuch an Act, and ſo readeth the titles of that
Act or Acts. They pray you to conſider of them, &amp; ſhew them your
adviſe; which done, they go their way. They being gone, and the
doore againe being ſhut, the Speaker rehearſeth to the houſe what
they ſaid. And if they be not buſie diſputing at the time in another
Bill, he asketh them ſtraight way, if they will have that Bill, or

In like manner in the lower Houſe, the Speaker ſitting in a ſeat or
chayre for that purpoſe, ſomewhat higher, that he may ſee, and be
ſeene of them all, hath before him in a lower ſeat his Clarke, who
readeth ſuch Bills as be firſt propounded in the lower Houſe, or be
ſent down from the Lords. For in that point each Houſe hath equall
authority to propound what they thinke meet, either for the abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
of ſome Law made before, or for making of a new. All Bills
be thrice in three divers dayes read, and diſputed upon before they
come to queſtion. In the diſputing is a marvailous good order uſed
in the lower Houſe. He that ſtandeth up bare-headed, is underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that he will ſpeake to the Bill. If more ſtand up, who that is
firſt judged to ariſe, is firſt heard, though the one doe praiſe the Law,
the other diſſwade it, yet there is no alteration. For every man
ſpeaketh as to the Speaker, not as one to another, for that is againſt
the order of the houſe. It is alſo taken againſt the order to name him,
whom ye doe confute, but by circumlocution, as he that ſpeaketh
with the Bill, or he that ſpeaketh againſt the Bill, and gave this and
this reaſon. And ſo with perpetuall oration, not with alteration, he
goeth through till he have made an end. He that once hath ſpoken
in a Bill, though he be confuted ſtrait, that day may not reply, no
though he would change his opinion. So that to one Bill in one day,
one may not in that Houſe ſpeake twice, for elſe one or two with
alteration would ſpend all the time; the next day he may, but then
alſo but once. No reviling or nipping words muſt be uſed. For then
all the Houſe will cry 'tis againſt the order, and if any ſpeake irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
or ſeditiouſly againſt the Prince or the privy Counſell, I have
ſeene them not only interrupted, but it hath been moved after to
the Houſe, and they have ſent them to the Tower. So that in ſuch
a multitude, and in ſuch a diverſity of minds, and opinions, there is
the greateſt modeſty and temperance of ſpeech that can be uſed.
Nevertheleſſe with much dulce and gentle termes, they make their
reaſons as violent, and as vehement the one againſt the other, as they
may ordinarily, except it be for urgent cauſes, and haſting of time.
At the afternoone they keep no Parliament. The Speaker hath no
voice in the Houſe, nor will they ſuffer him to ſpeake in any Bill to
move or diſſwade it. But when any Bill is read, the Speakers office
is, as briefly and as plainly as he may, to declare the effect thereof
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105581:5"/>
to the Houſe. If the Commons doe aſſent to ſuch Bills as be ſent to
them, firſt agreed upon from the Lords thus ſubſcribed, <hi>Les Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
ont aſſentus;</hi> ſo if the Lords doe agree to ſuch Bills as be firſt
agreed upon by the Commons, they ſend them downe to the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
thus ſubſcribed, <hi>Les Seigneurs ont aſſentus:</hi> if they cannot
agree, the two Houſes (for every Bill from whence ſoever it doth
come is thrice read in each of the Houſes) if it be underſtood that
there is any ſticking, ſometimes the Lords to the Commons, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the Commons to the Lords doe require that a certaine of each
Houſe may meet together, and ſo each part be informed of others
meaning, and this is alwayes granted. After which meeting for the
moſt part, not alwayes, either part agrees to others Bills.</p>
               <p>In the upper Houſe they give their aſſent and diſſent each man
ſeverally by himſelfe; firſt for himſelfe, and then for ſo many as he
hath Proxy. When the Chancellor hath demanded of them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they will go to the queſtion, after the Bill hath been thrice read?
they ſaying only content or not content, without further reaſoning
or replying, and as the more number doth agree, ſo is it agreed on
or daſhed.</p>
               <p>In the neather Houſe none of them that is elected, either Knight
or Burgeſſe can give his voyce to another, nor his conſent or diſſent
by Proxy. The more part of them that be preſent only maketh the
conſent or diſſent. After the Bill hath been twice read, and then
ingroſſed, and eſt-ſoones read and diſputed on enough as is thought,
the Speaker asketh, if they will go to the queſtion, and if they agree?
he holdeth the Bill up in his hand, and ſaith, as many as will have
this Bill go forward, which is concerning ſuch a matter, ſay, yea.
Then they which allow the Bill, cry yea, and as many as will not,
ſay no: as the cry of yea, or no is bigger, ſo the Bill is allowd or
daſhed. If it be a doubt which cry is bigger, they divide the Houſe,
the Speaker ſaying, as many as doe allow the Bill, go downe with
the Bill, and as many as doe, not ſit ſtill. So they divide themſelves,
and being ſo divided, they are numbred who made the more part,
and ſo the Bill doth ſpeed. It chanceth ſometime that ſome part of
the Bill is allowed, ſome other part hath much controverſie and
doubt made of it, and it is thought if it were amended it would go
forward. Then they chuſe certains <hi>Committees</hi> of them who have
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105581:6"/>
ſpoken with the Bill, and againſt it, to amend it, and bring it again
ſo amended, as they amongſt them ſhall think meet: and this is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is ingroſſed, yea and ſometime after. But the agreement of
theſe Committees is no prejudice to the Houſe. For at the laſt que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
they will accept it or daſh it, as it ſhall ſeem good, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that whatſoever the Committees have done.</p>
               <p>Thus no Bill is an Act of Parliament, Ordinance, or Edict of Law,
untill both the Houſes have ſeverally agreed unto it after the order
aforeſaid, no nor then neither. But the laſt day of that Parliament
or Seſſion, the Prince cometh in Perſon in His Parliament Robes,
and ſitteth in His State, all the upper houſe ſitteth about the Prince
in their States and order in their Robes. The Speaker with all the
Commons Houſe cometh to the Barre, and there after thanks-giving
firſt in the Lords name by the Chancellor &amp;c. And in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
name by the Speaker to the Prince, for that He hath ſo great
care of the government of His People, and for calling them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to adviſe of ſuch things as ſhould be for the Reformation; eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing
and ornament of the Common-wealth. The Chancellor in
the Princes name giveth thankes to the Lords and Commons, for
their pains and travailes taken, which he the ſaid Prince will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
and recompence when time and occaſion ſhall ſerve, and
that he for his part is ready to declare his pleaſure concerning their
proceedings, whereby the ſame may have perfect life and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment,
by His Princely authority, and ſo have the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of the Realme. Then one reads the Titles of every Act, which
hath paſſed at that Seſſion, but only in this faſhon: An Act concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch a thing, &amp;c. It is marked there what the Prince doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and to ſuch he ſaith <hi>Le Roy,</hi> or <hi>La Royn le vults</hi> And thoſe be
taken now as perfect Lawes, and Ordinances of the Realme of
England, and none other, and as ſhortly as may be put in Print,
except it be ſome private cauſe, or Law made for the benefit or
prejudice of ſome private man, which the Romans were wont to
call <hi>Privilegia.</hi> Theſe be only exemplified under the Seale of
the Parliament, and for the moſt part not Printed. To thoſe which
the Prince liketh not he anſwereth <hi>Le Roy</hi> or <hi>La Royne ſaduiſera,</hi>
and thoſe be accounted utterly daſned and of none effect.</p>
               <p>This is the Order and Forme of the higheſt and moſt authenticall

there is nothing inclined to Popularity. About a twenty dayes or
ſuch a time before the Parliament, Proclamation is made through
the Kingdom, to deliver into the Kings Clark of Regiſter (whom
ye here call the Maſter of the Rolles) all Billes to be exhibited that
Seſſions, before a certain day. Then are they brought unto the
King, and peruſed and conſidered by Him; and only ſuch as I allow
of are put into the Chancellors hands, to be propounded to the
Parliament and none others. And if any man in Parliament ſpeak
of any other matter, then is in this forme firſt allowed by me,
the Chancellor tells him there is no ſuch Bill allowed by the
