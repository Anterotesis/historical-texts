            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Exeter College CASE. <hi>Philips ver' Bury.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>EJectment in <hi>B. R.</hi> for the Rectors Houſe of <hi>Exon.</hi> Coll. in <hi>Oxon.</hi> upon a ſpecial Verdict, (though the Plaintiff was not Statutably elected, yet) the ſole Queſtion was, Whether the Deprivation of Dr. <hi>Bury</hi> the Rector, by the Biſhop of <hi>Exeter</hi> the Viſitor, be good in Law? And Adjudged for the Defendant, that the Sentence of Deprivation is void in Law; and from that Judgment the Plaintiff brings his Writ of Error in the Houſe of Lords?</p>
            <div type="case_proper">
               <head>The CASE.</head>
               <p>MR. <hi>Colmer</hi> one of the Fellows of the College, being Statutably Expell'd for Incontinency, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to the Viſitor, who ſends Dr. <hi>Maſters</hi> his Commiſſary, to hear the Appeal in <hi>March,</hi> 1689. Dr. <hi>Maſters</hi> comes, and the Rector and Fellows attend him and Submit to him as in a Viſitation, but as to the Appeal they do proteſt againſt it; becauſe by the Statutes of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, no Appeal lyes to the Viſitor or his Commiſſary, but to the Vice-Chancellor of <hi>Oxford,</hi> who is Appointed the Judge to determine Controverſies between the Rector and Fellows: And a Fellow when he takes his Oath, Renounces all Appeals, if he ſhall happen to be Expelled by the Rector and Senior Fellows; and that Statute which directeth the Expulſion of a Fellow, forbiddeth all Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals.</p>
               <p>The Viſitor comes in Perſon upon the 16th. of <hi>June</hi> following, the Rector and Major part of the Fellows under their Common Seal, (being Bound by their Oaths to defend their privileges) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, that they cannot in Conſcience Submit to him in that Viſitation, becauſe by the Statutes, the Viſitor or his Commiſſary can <hi>Liberè accedere ad Collegium, but once in Five Years,</hi> unleſs Requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Rector and Senior Fellows; and they conceived that the Commiſſary's coming before was a <hi>Liber Acceſſus,</hi> and an Execution of the Quinquennial Power. The Viſitor thereupon gave an Oath to <hi>Webber</hi> concerning the Summons, and did an Act of Viſitation, and call'd over the Names of the Rector and Fellows, and they Appearing and Proteſting, he departed.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop comes again the 24th. of <hi>July</hi> following, at which time the Rector and Major part of the Fellows under their Common Seal, make the like Proteſtation as before; and then he Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed to the 25th. and at that time he Suſpends the Major part of the Fellows, Seniors and others, and deprives <gap reason="illegible: blacked out" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> one of the Senior Fellows, and Adjourns to the 26th. day; and at that time he deprives the Rector, with the Conſent of Four Fellows that were not Seniors; and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force his Sentence, Excommunicated the Rector if he did not within a Week depart from his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; which Excommunication upon full hearing, the Court of <hi>Kings Bench</hi> commanded him to revoke, but he refuſeth to do it.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="judgment">
               <head>The REASONS of the Judgment of the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> were:</head>
               <p n="1">1. THat by the Statutes of the College, the Biſhop can come to Viſit but <hi>once in Five Years,</hi> and <hi>that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſitation can laſt but three days;</hi> but in the Caſe in Queſtion, the Rector was deprived upon the 26th. day of <hi>July,</hi> which was the 4th. day of the pretended Viſitation: For the 16th. day of <hi>June</hi> was to be reckon'd one day of the Viſitation; for the Biſhop appointed it to be ſo, and upon that day did an Act of Viſitation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By the Statutes of the College the Viſitor may not Puniſh Rector or Fellow otherwiſe then the Statutes direct, and there is a liſt of ſuch crimes as are to be puniſhed by Deprivation; but Contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy is not mentioned. Nor did the Founder intend to put the Rector and Fellows in worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than any other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, by being Perjured if they do not defend their Privileges, or Ruin'd if they do.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By the Statutes of the College, the Conſent of Four of the Seven Senior Fellows is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to the Deprivation of a Rector: And tho' to his Sentence there was the Conſent of Four Fellows, yet they were not of the Seven Seniors; and the Suſpenſion of the Seven Seniors did not debar them of this right of Conſenting to the Sentence.</p>
               <p>The Viſitor is appointed by the Statutes the Expoſitor of the words, and meaning of them; and by taking the Conſent of Four Fellows (tho' they be not the right) to the Sentence, and their Subſcriptions thereto, he has Expounded the words, ſo as to require ſuch a Conſent as neceſſary.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Rector's refuſing to ſubmit to this Viſitation upon a miſtake, if there were any, is not a Reaſonable cauſe for his deprivation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Rector was never Perſonally charged with the Crime for which he was deprived, nor had any time or warning given him to Anſwer ſuch a charge, as the words of the Statute do require; and there be words in the Sentence which are too general, and give no particular Charge, and can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no particular Anſwer; as <hi>Aliorum criminum enormium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. That the Reaſonableneſs or Unreaſonableneſs of a Viſitors Sentence, is Examinable in <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-Hall,</hi> is the Opinion of the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Dyer</hi> fol. 209. as in Dr. <hi>Coveny</hi>'s Caſe the Preſident of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Coll. in <hi>Oxon.</hi> and of the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Cook,</hi> in his 11. <hi>Rep.</hi> fol. 99. in <hi>James Bagg</hi>'s Caſe.</p>
               <p rend="italic">And therefore it is Humbly Hoped, that the Judgment given by the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> for the Defendent, will be Affirmed by your LORDSHIPS.</p>
