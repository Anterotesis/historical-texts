            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Proclamation declaring His Majeſties Reſolution for ſettling a ſpeedy Peace by a good Accommodation, and an Invitation to all His Loyall Subjects to joyne together for His Aſſiſtance therein.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongſt: the many Troubles wherewith (for more then two yeares laſt paſt) We have beene involves, nothing hath more afflicted Vs, then the reall ſenſe of our Subiects ſufferings, occaſioned by this moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall Warre; And the chiefe of Our Care hath beene (and by Gods aſſiſtance ſhall ſtill be) to ſettle them in a happy Peace, with that freedome of enioying the exerciſe of their Religion, Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, according to the Lawes of this Kingdome, as they or any of their Anceſtors enioyed the ſame in the beſt times of the of the late Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> or Our Royall Father. And as we have allwayes profeſt in the ſincerity of Our heart, That no ſucceſſe ſhould ever make Vs averſe unto Peace, ſo have We alwayes when God hath bleſt Vs with any eminent Victory, ſollicited the Members of both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment remaining at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> by frequent Meſſages for a Treaty conducing thereunto: and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar upon Our late Victory over the Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his Army in <hi>Cornwall</hi> (which We wholly attribute to the immediate hand of God) We preſently diſpatcht a Meſſage to them to deſire a Treaty for Peace and Accommodation; of which, as likewiſe of that former Meſſage for Peace, which We ſent them from Eveſiam the fourth of <hi>July</hi> late, We have yet received no anſwer. And therefore have reſolved with Our Army to draw preſently towards <hi>London,</hi> and Our Southern and Eaſtern Counties, not looking upon thoſe parts as Enemies to Vs, and ſo to ſuffer by the approach of Our Army, or the diſorders thereof (which We will uſe all poſſible meanes to prevent) but as Our poore Subiects oppreſſed by power (of which We reſt aſſured the greater part remaine loyall to Vs) and ſo deſerving Our protection. And We hope that at a nearer diſtance of place there may beget ſo right an underſtanding betweene Vs and Our People, that at length We may obtaine a Treaty for Peace, and a full, free and peaceable Convention in Parliament, and therein make an end of theſe umhappy differences by a good Accommodation. In which We hereby aſſure all Our People upon Our Royall Word, and the Faith of a Chriſtian (which is the greateſt Security We can give them) that We will inſiſt onely upon the ſetling and continuance of the true Reformed Proteſtant Religion, Our owne undoubted Knowne Rights, the priviledges of Parliament, and Our Subiects Liberty and Property, according to the Lawes of the Land, and to have all theſe ſetled in a full and free Parliament, whereby the Armies on both ſides may be preſently disbanded, this Kingdome may be ſecured from the danger of a Conqueſt by Forraigne Forces, all Strangers now in Armes may returne to their owne Countreys, and Our poore Subiects be forced of thoſe grievous burthens, which by reaſon of the late Diſtractions, have (much againſt Our will) too much preſſed them. And to the end Our Subiects may no longer be miſſed by falſe pretences, We doe deſire all of them, as well in Our owne Quarters, as where the Rebells have uſurped a power, to take into ſerious conſideration the duty and loyalty which by the Law of God and their Oath of Allegiance they owe unto Vs, and more particularly that part thereof which concernes the defence of Our Perſon, and aſſiſtance of Vs againſt Rebells, and ſuch as riſe in Armes againſt Vs, which they may find plainely ſet downe in the Statute of the II. yeare of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 7. Cap. I. And We doe hereby require Our Subiects within Our owne Quarters thorow or neare which We ſhall paſſe, by that duty they owe to Vs and their Country, that they forthwith prepare themſelves with the beſt Armes they can get, to be ready, and to ioyne, and go along with Vs in this preſent Expedition (We reſolving to take ſpeciall care to place them under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Gentlemen of Quality of their owne Countreys, to their good content and ſatiſfaction.) And We likewiſe require and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize all Our good Subjects, as well the Trayned Bands as others of Our City of <hi>London,</hi> and Our Southern and Eaſtern Counties, to chooſe their owne Commanders and Leaders amongſt thoſe Gentlemen and Citizens that are of approved loyalty to Vs, and Lovers of the Peace of their Country, and upon Our approach towards thoſe parts, to put themſelves into Armes, and march in warlike manner to aſſiſt Vs in this good worke, and free themſelve from the Tyranny of their fellow Subiects, under which they groane, Commanding and authorizing them to ſeize ſuch places of Strength in thoſe Southerne and Eaſterne Counties as the Rebells have poſſeſſed themſelves of; to oppoſe with force of Armes ſuch perſons as ſhall reſiſt them in obeying theſe Our Commands, and to apprehend and ſecure the perſons of all ſuch as ſhall endeavour to continue this Rebellion, and to hinder the ſetling of the Peace of this Kingdome in a full and free Convention of Parliament; (the onely viſible meanes left, by the bleſſiing of God, to redeeme this Nation from utter ruine) wherein We will afford Our utmoſt protection and ſafety unto all Our Subiects that ſhall give Obedience to theſe Our Commands. And as We doubt not but that all Our good Subiects will come chearefully to Our aſſiſtance for ſo good an end (beyond which We doe not requre it) ſo We truſt that God, who hath hitherto wonderfully preſerved Vs, will crowne this action with happy ſucceſſe, for his glory, and the welfare of this poore Nation.</p>
