            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Proposal concerning the COIN.</head>
            <p>THE best Expedient to hinder (as the Proposer conceives) the going out o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>
our Silver whilst we have any Gold, is to make it the Interest of those that
deal in them, both to melt down and export as well the one as the other,
(if they may not be Exported in Coin) for melted down and Exported they'l be,
let what Law soever be made to the contrary, unless the Occasions beyond Sea can
otherwise be better supply'd. For the Explaining whereof, such Gentlemen as do
not yet know it, may by this be informed, that in the <hi>Spanish</hi> Dominion, whence
most of the Gold and Silver does come, and where for that Reason the Proportion
in value is originally set, and must through the rest of the World be allowed, is as
16 to 1, and so 4 Guinea's coined at 20 <hi>s.</hi> each, (as they are in this Kingdom)
comes to 4 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixteen Crowns coin'd at 5 <hi>s.</hi> each comes to 4 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So 16 Crowns is equal to 4 Guinea's.</p>
            <p>Now suppose 4 Guinea's coin'd of the same weight they now are, should by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
be reckon'd at 1 <hi>l. 4 s.</hi> apiece, they come to 4 <hi>l. 16 s.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixteen Crowns coin'd at 5 <hi>s.</hi> if made by Authority to pass for 6 <hi>s.</hi> then 16
Crowns comes to 4 <hi>l. 16 s.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which makes the Par equal betwixt Silver and Gold, which always will have,
as it ever has had for convenience 18 <hi>d.</hi> or 2 <hi>s.</hi> still running upon it, so Guinea's as
aforesaid, set at 24 <hi>s.</hi> will have the Currency of 25 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> or 26 <hi>s.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Now against this 'twill be said,</head>
               <p>Tis Raising the Standard setled by an Act of this Sessions upon mature Reasons.</p>
               <p>'Tis not altering the Standard, for that however continues; 'tis only giving a
Currency to Silver and Gold, as above exprest, for Publick Convenience, 'till other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
provided by Parliament.</p>
               <p>And as to the Reasons ('tis confessed) that have been strongly urged to the
contrary, they are to be answer'd by common Convenience, and the word <hi>Necessity,</hi>
against which no Law ever did or ought at any time at all to prevail.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>As to the Convenience the Publick will reap,</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note, 100000 l.</hi> this way pays 120000 <hi>l.</hi> at present, of which the Publick will
have the Advantage, and if at any time hereafter it should be found needful to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the same Crowns to 5 <hi>s.</hi> again, 'twill be then but paying 12 <hi>d.</hi> apiece to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Person possest of such Crowns of which the Publick as had the use in the mean
time, so it may the better by the Publick be repaid. And note also, The Re-pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Shilling so to be hoped for on the Crowns, will hinder their either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
melted down or Exported, it being to be lost if they be.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>As to the Necessity,</head>
               <p>'Tis agreed on all Hands, that whilst Gold goes for more than 'tis worth, and
Silver for less, the one will be hoarded or carried away, and the other left to go by
it self.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>This further Satisfaction 'twill give,</head>
               <p>To Farmers and others actual Possessors of Land in the Country, 'twill keep up
the Price of their Commodities, <hi>viz.</hi> of Wooll, Cattle, Corn, Tinn, Lead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
to their general Satisfaction, because they will be thereby enabled the better to pay
their Rents to their Landlords, who for that Reason 'tis hoped and believed, will
have very little Cause to complain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> What is before Proposed is no way Repugnant to the late Vote, That
Guinea's shall not be taken or paid at above 28 <hi>s.</hi> and may yet be Enacted this
Sessions (as 'tis humbly conceived) if so be that it is but approved.</p>
