            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving taken occasion to present the following Papers of your Noble and Learned Father to the World, I held my self obliged to make a particular Dedication of 'em to your self, in whom so much of the Acuteness of his Wit, and of his incomparable Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, and of his Loyalty to his Prince, and Conformity to the Church, Fidelity in Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and Candour of Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Manners, is Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous to the World: And by which latter Qualification your
<pb facs="tcp:62633:3"/>
Conversation is perfectly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to all who have the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of it.</p>
            <p>His Lordships great value of these generous qualities in you, was often signified to me by him in my more than twenty five years frequent Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him in the latter part of his Life; and wherein you gave him so much just Cause to presage, that your Lordship would be both a Propp and an Ornament to his Family.</p>
            <p>And I doubt not but those Great and Manly efforts of his Reason, Religion and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I here lay before your thoughts, will be further In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements to you to make a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural use of his great Example, and to spend as much of your
<pb facs="tcp:62633:3"/>
Life, as you can spare from the Service of your Country, in the most vigorous pursuits after Knowledge, and in the investi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Truth; and for your doing which, you have in the Course of Nature so fair a prospect of a long race of Life before you.</p>
            <p>His Lordship used often to quote occasionally that saying of my Lord Bacon's, <hi>Actio est Conversatio cum Stultis, lectio autem cum Sapientibus</hi>: The thought whereof induced him to spend so much of his time in his Library; and where he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually loc'kd himself up so close, that in stead of fortifying his Interest at Court, as great Men do, by frequent giving of Visits to one another he very
<pb facs="tcp:62633:4"/>
much avoided the receiving them.</p>
            <p>And therefore he having so vast a Collection of Choice Books both in the Ancient and Modern Languages, and especially of Divinity, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law, Civil Law, Canon-Law, and History; and laying the Scene of his Life so much among them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and living to a good Old Age, the World might well expect that what he should leave behind him of his own Composing, should be worthy of himself, and it: And such your Lordship will find this Volume to be.</p>
            <p>The first Work of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that I shall Entertain your Lordship and the World with, is that of his Letter to
<pb facs="tcp:62633:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
my self, of <hi>Iuly</hi> the 18<hi>th.</hi> 1683, Writ on the occasion of my minding him of his yearly Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of sending Venison to Sir <hi>George Ent</hi>; and which Letter is variously instructful to the Age. I placed before his large <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi> by way of <hi>Letter</hi> to me in Answer of Mine to him of that Nature, because the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of time required it.</p>
            <p>He had my entire <hi>Discourse</hi> by him in his Study, Printed and bound up long before he dyed. And his Lordship telling me, that he intended his by way of return to it, and to be Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Folio</hi> to be bound up with mine; mine thereby happen'd not to be Published in his Life time.</p>
            <p>It was afterward Published with the Title of <hi>the Happy Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb facs="tcp:62633:5"/>
State of</hi> England, and since by a new Title, viz, <hi>A Discourse of the growth of</hi> England, <hi>in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulousness and trade since the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Printed for</hi> Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Rogers, <hi>at the Sun over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst St.</hi> Dunstans Church <hi>in</hi> Fleet-Street.</p>
            <p>And as all great Writers (and especially of such Subjects that refer to various kinds of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) have Customarily employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed several persons in gathering Quotations for them, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting them (and as for this purpose, I have some where Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Lord Secretary Falkland,</hi> for saying of <hi>Cardinal Peron,</hi> that <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> were but fit to gather Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for him) so your Father was pleased to Crave the Aid
<pb facs="tcp:62633:5"/>
of Quotations from his Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Friend <hi>Bishop Barlow,</hi> in two or three Points relating to The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology and the Canon Law, and which were sent to him in Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. I scarce know any one Man who is so absolute a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of all the various kinds of Learning refer'd to in your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers large following <hi>Discourse,</hi> as to have commanded the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per use thereof, without apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Labour of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Friend in this kind. Nor have any of the most Learned of the Jesuits presumed to Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish the most Famous and Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate of their Volumes, either Historical or Mathematical, without owing a beholding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to others for Quotations.</p>
            <p>And as any one here, who
<pb facs="tcp:62633:6"/>
entertains a great Prince in a Splendid manner, holds himself obliged not to confine himself to his own Ground for all the Materials of his Treat, so he who invites to his Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment no meaner a <hi>Guest</hi> than the <hi>World</hi> by his Writings, ought not to Disdain the use of the Heads or Hands of others in finding out the most Curious Provision for it, and especially in so Critical an Age as this.</p>
            <p>But even herein was your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers great Modesty so Signal, as to shew that he designed not the Appropriating wholy to himself the Honour of all the <hi>Bishops</hi> Learned and Judicious Quotations (and which yet by the Custom of other great Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he might have justifiably
<pb facs="tcp:62633:6"/>
done) that he is pleased to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie to the World in <hi>p.</hi> 21. his having apply'd to the <hi>Bishop</hi> on that account, and what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications he had from him by Letters, and his desire of their Publication.</p>
            <p>Another great instance of his Exuberant Modesty, I shall here Entertain your Lordship with, is the great Complement he was pleased to put on me, when not very long before his last Sickness, he delivered to me his large <hi>Discourse</hi> as fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Writ out by his <hi>Amanuenses,</hi> and variously altered by his own Hand (and the which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Printers have made use of, I intend to offer to your Lordships Cabinet) and desired me, that I would take the same
<pb facs="tcp:62633:7"/>
Freedom in putting out, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leting any thing I thought Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous or proper to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punged, as he told me, Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> had desired me to do when I Published his Excellent Book of <hi>The Style of the Scriptures.</hi> Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> in a Letter to me Printed before that Book, Addrest it to me with the Initial Letters of Mr. <hi>P.P. A.G. F.I.</hi> (by which he meant to refer to me as <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate General for</hi> Ireland, and giving a Friendly Reason for not more openly naming me.) And he is there pleased to say, <hi>I have been obliged, that I might obey you, not only to Dismember, but to Mangle the Treatise you perused, cutting out here a whole side, and there half, and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place perhaps a quarter of one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62633:7"/>And if it had so pleased God, that your Father had lived any considerable time longer, I would have humbly offered it to his Consideration, to have some Passages there omitted, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly that wherein he giveth his thoughts of somewhat in <hi>p.</hi> 70. of my <hi>Discourse,</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise those wherein his Lordship is pleased to signifie his over-va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing of my poor Sixth-rate Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, and my performance in my Work. But since he lived not long enough for my having an opportunity to satisfie him with my Reasons, for the leaving out any passages, as I did the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> I presum'd not to delete any thing therein, worth the speaking of. But as I took great Care to watch the
<pb facs="tcp:62633:8"/>
Press in my Publication of that Noble Work of Mr. <hi>Boyles,</hi> to prevent the Printers <hi>Errata,</hi> so I have in this of your Fathers.</p>
            <p>The Author of the <hi>Athenae Oxonienses</hi> having among the <hi>Lives</hi> of the <hi>Oxford Writers,</hi> Writ that of your Father, is there plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to mention, that in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>year</hi> 1686. <hi>He began to be admitted into the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of King</hi> James <hi>the</hi> II. But he was admitted into his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Favour before; and Mr. <hi>Ryley</hi> after your Fathers Death, shew'd me this in his Lordships <hi>Diary,</hi> viz. <hi>On</hi> March 8.85. <hi>Spent most at home in Business; and Duty</hi> (i. e. Prayer) <hi>In the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was private with the Lord</hi> Sunderland, <hi>my good Friend; and then was with the King a full hour
<pb facs="tcp:62633:8"/>
at Mr.</hi> Chiffinches; <hi>who was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind, free, and open in Discourse: Said, he would not be Priest-rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; Read a Letter of the Late King, said I should be welcome to him.</hi> I refer to this, to shew like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise on what Terms he stood in the Royal Favour (and which was so great to him, that his Friends supposed, that had he lived a Month longer, he would have been Lord Chancellour) and that his zeal for his Religion, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered no Diminution thereby, and which sufficiently appeared by the Picture of his mind drawn by himself in the following <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,</hi> and to which he was then applying his finishing Touches.</p>
            <p>And hence the Reader may guess, that his private Belief of his Prince not designing the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>settlement
<pb facs="tcp:62633:9"/>
of our Religion, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged him in his thoughts of Loyalty, and in his Inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Moral Offices of it so much throughout the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Discourse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed his Advices then about it, were but Eccho's to the Pulpits of the Divines of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in general, that rang with it till the time of the setting up the Ecclesiastical High Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssion, and by virtue of which, they had apprehensions of their being removeable out of their Church-Freeholds in two or three days time: And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they had (as I may say, in the School-Divinity Terms) the <hi>motus primo primi,</hi> to think that the <hi>Affirmative</hi> precepts of
<pb facs="tcp:62633:9"/>
Preaching up Loyalty in their Sermons as before, did not bind <hi>Semper &amp; ad Semper.</hi> But your Father was in his Grave, before the Birth of that Commission, and it was several Months after in that year 1686. before the Commissioners opened their Commission, and which they did on <hi>Tuesday</hi> the 3<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>August</hi> that year.</p>
            <p>However it may be said that no Revolutions time can cause, can make persuasives to Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wholy useless, or it cease to be a Vertue, or to want the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of any Government, and which must be supported by it.</p>
            <p>But your Fathers growth in his Habitual <hi>Loyalty,</hi> when he was so near his End, needs no <hi>Apology.</hi> And according to the

observation I have met with from some of our Practical Divines that <hi>God watcheth when his Child is at the best, and his Graces ripest, and then takes him,</hi> thus was it with your Noble Father.</p>
            <p>And as no thought can be more obvious to a prudent States-Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who was for a time Employed by his Prince in a Provincial King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom under his Vice-Roy, and was preparing to return to his King, and to be under his Eye, than that 'tis his great concern to part fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the <hi>Vice-Roy,</hi> and not to be conscious of having Dishonoured, or of having render'd him uneasie in the discharge of his Office; so neither can it be unthought of by any Pious Minister of Kings (who are Gods Vice-Gerents) that it highly imports him after his splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
<pb facs="tcp:62633:10"/>
Sojourning here, to have the Testimonials of a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ready to carry to Heaven with him, that he here Honoured the great King of Heaven and Earth, in the persons of such Vice-gerents, and did not by stirring up any popular ferments, trouble their Administration and frustrate their Counsels.</p>
            <p>Had your Father lived to have come to the Helm of State, as a <hi>primier Ministre,</hi> I believe his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence would have prevented ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inconveniences that happened by the Bigotry, Pedantry, and blind zeal of some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar papists. For tho I have own'd to the World in print, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Tempers and Justice and prudence of some Great Roman-Catholicks then, yet I have often
<pb facs="tcp:62633:11"/>
been diverted by the impotent passion of some certain Popish Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, who, because I in my Book which I designed as perswasive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Exclusion, &amp; the growth of the popular fears of Papists and Popery, and wrote in the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid interval of the Kingdom, the interval of panic Fears, and when the Ayre of Mens fancies was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally infected, and the Kingdom was in a Chaos-like condition, thought it necessary to Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, that I was a <hi>Non-Papist,</hi> and not to dilate in invectives against the Belief of any popish Plot what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, and against all the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in particular, were pleased in common talk, to shoot the bolts of their Censures against me and my Works. And the truth is, for any writer for the aforesaid pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
<pb facs="tcp:62633:11"/>
to have then appeared in such a <hi>Dress,</hi> as they would have had him, would have shew'd as strangely, as when it once happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that one being to Act <hi>Theseus</hi> in <hi>Hercules furens</hi> coming out of Hell, he could not for a long time be perswaded to wear some old sooty Clothes, but would needs come out of Hell in a white Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Doublet.</p>
            <p>Your Fathers Learned Book may in various places, teach such Censorious bigots common sense. And his Lordship justly coming under the Character of <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, I may account his single acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of my performance, to out-weigh Myriads of such Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Censurers, and be very well content with my having escaped the Scandal of their praise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62633:12"/>But here I must needs say, that as I have sufficiently shewn in print, the aversion of my Humour from courting the popular praise of any party (as having judged that the medicament of Notions I applyed to each, would be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily helped in the working by the ungratefulness of the Taste) so by my having so long delay'd the publication of this excellent Volume of your Father, I have shewn some uneasiness or back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness in receiving the various Honour he was pleased in his short Letter prefixed, and following large one, to do to that Work of mine, which in obedience to his Commands, and for the doing him Justice I wrote.</p>
            <p>And I believe, had not a Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Prudent Friend of mine
<pb facs="tcp:62633:12"/>
of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> told me, that my being thus accessory to the publishing of your Fathers Lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Acknowledgments of my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, was as much consistent with the Laws of Modesty as is many grave and wise Authors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixing Commendatory Verses or Prose-testimonials from others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their works (and for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, he told me of Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> having before a philosophical and politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Work of his, printed some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent verses of Dr. <hi>Bathurst</hi>; and of Dr. <hi>Templer</hi> having printed some of another before his admirable Confutation of <hi>Leviathan</hi>) and withal represented it to me, that I was in Conscience bound to the supporting the Honour of our Church, by the publishing the New Matter contained in your Fathers

finished your <hi>Casuistical Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi> of the <hi>Obligatoriness</hi> of our <hi>Oaths</hi> as to the King, his <hi>Heirs and Successors</hi>: I was easily sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, with your taking your own time for the Publishing the whole, as knowing that the <hi>Torrent</hi> of <hi>Shamm,</hi> and <hi>Calumny</hi> by which the Reputations of many Loyal Persons were born down, was too <hi>violent</hi> to be of any <hi>long</hi> continuance; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering likewise, that your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporating the <hi>Character</hi> of my <hi>Life,</hi> into a <hi>Work</hi> so full of various exquisite Learning of all sorts (and particularly of that now so much in request, Namely, the reducing <hi>Political</hi> Matters by Calculation <hi>ad fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam</hi> (as you call it) that by the Course of Nature, must be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal,

            <p>The truth is, you having been the first Person who took the pains to find out by the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords</hi> of the <hi>Pole Bills,</hi> and the <hi>Bishops</hi> survey, the <hi>Number</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> have highly Merited the <hi>thanks</hi> of your <hi>Country</hi> thereby, as having necessarily rendred its <hi>Figure</hi> and <hi>Alliances</hi> in the World the more considerable.

            <p>I remember not in all the Books I have read, to have found so much, and so various <hi>Political</hi> Calculation, as in this your <hi>Discourse</hi>: And because you intend a <hi>Review</hi> thereof, I think it will be in any who have the <hi>Custody</hi> of <hi>Records</hi> that may be of use to you; a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to the publick, to be

            <p>Though I need not observe to any <hi>Reader</hi> of your <hi>Discourse,</hi> the <hi>height</hi> of your <hi>Eloquence</hi> and great unaffected <hi>Wit,</hi> and the <hi>Nervous</hi> way of <hi>Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> appearing therein, yet I am obliged to acquaint you, that in some particular <hi>passages</hi> therein, my Observations of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Things,</hi> have been different from yours: But all of which I hold my self like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise obliged, not to trouble the World or you with at this time; for your having menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned your intended <hi>Review,</hi> to be Published in a Volum by it self: I who have received so much kindness from you, am to do you the <hi>Iustice</hi> to stay a

while in expecting your <hi>Second</hi> thoughts, and without <hi>boding</hi> ill of your being any way par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial therein; yet shall here at present acquaint you, that as I am a <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as now by <hi>Law</hi> Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, I will not Recede a <hi>Iot</hi> from its <hi>Doctrine,</hi> by Judging the <hi>Papacy</hi> not to be <hi>Antichrist,</hi> or by judging the Worshipping the <hi>Host,</hi> not to be <hi>formal</hi> Idolatry, as my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured Friends, Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> and <hi>Bishop Taylor</hi> (as you say) have done: And shall here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to you, that tho' Bishop <hi>Taylor</hi> in his <hi>Liberty of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying,</hi> pronounced <hi>Worshiping</hi> the <hi>Host,</hi> to be not <hi>FORMAL Idolatry,</hi> yet afterward upon more Mature thoughts, he in

his <hi>Disswasive against Popery,</hi> did make it <hi>FORMAL Idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall likewise tell you, that Bishop <hi>Sanderson,</hi> whom you so often <hi>quote,</hi> and whose Judgment you so deservedly Celebrate, doth amongst his <hi>Sermons</hi> printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1657. in the <hi>fifth</hi> Sermon, <hi>Ad Populum p.</hi> 287. in plain Terms call the Pope <hi>the Man of Sin</hi>; the <hi>Text</hi> of the Sermon is 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4. The Bishop there represents the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> as <hi>injurious</hi> to our <hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> in this <hi>passage</hi> (saith he) hath branded with an indeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble note of <hi>Infamy</hi>; in as much as those very <hi>Doctrines,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he gives an instance, as <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Devils,</hi> are the <hi>receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Tenets</hi> and <hi>Conclusions</hi> of that <hi>Church,</hi> not to insist on
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62633:27"/>
other prejudices done to <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Liberty</hi> by the <hi>intolerable Vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation</hi> of the <hi>Man of Sin</hi>: where he refers in his Margent to 2 <hi>Th.</hi> 2, 3. who <hi>exerciseth a Spiritual Tyranny</hi> over Mens <hi>Consciences,</hi> as opposite to <hi>Evangelical Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> as <hi>Antichrist</hi> is to <hi>Christ. Let us a little see how she hath fulfilled St.</hi> Pauls <hi>Prediction, in teaching Lying and Divelish Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and that with seared Consciences and in Hypocrisie,</hi> in the <hi>two Specialties mentioned in the next verse,</hi> viz. <hi>Forbidding to Marry; and commanding to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from Meats.</hi> And then the Bishop saith, <hi>Marriage, the Holy Ordinance of God, is yet by this purple Strumpet forbidden, and that</hi> Sub Mortali to <hi>Bishops, Priests, Deacons, &amp;c.</hi> and he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62633:28"/>
there for that Appellation of <hi>purple Strumpet,</hi> refers in his Margent to, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.13.</p>
            <p>And as I have here cited this great B. for this purpose; so I may likewise refer you to the work of our B. of <hi>Lincoln</hi> called <hi>Brutum Fulmen,</hi> as proving the Pope to be <hi>Antichrist,</hi> contrary to the Assertions of <hi>Grotius</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> and others: I never think of this Bishop, and of his Incomparable Knowledge, both in Theology and Church-History, and in the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Law, without applying to him in my Thoughts, the Character that <hi>Cicero</hi> gave <hi>Cras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> viz. <hi>Vir non unus é multis, sed unus inter omnes, propè sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularis</hi>: And I desire here to own my beholdingness to his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62633:28"/>
communicative Disposition, for assisting me with quotations and his Judgment when I have occasion to Crave his Aid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as you know I have late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done; and shall be glad that the learning in such Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as I have received from him, wherein there are many excellent Notions, which I had no occasion to quote, may sometime see the light.</p>
            <p>But I am in the next place with Justice, to acknowledge it to you, that you have in your <hi>Reflections</hi> on the <hi>Vsurpations</hi> of the <hi>late</hi> times, acquainted the World with several things use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be inserted in the <hi>History</hi> of that <hi>Age,</hi> and could wish that such a <hi>Writer</hi> as your self, would undertake the writing of it.</p>

            <p>But it was the ill fate of that <hi>Cardinal,</hi> on the account of his great Fame for the <hi>Politicks,</hi> to be falsely <hi>Cited,</hi> and even as to the point of the <hi>Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Treason,</hi> by several who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read him, and particularly by Mr. <hi>Osborne,</hi> in his <hi>works</hi> bound together, <hi>p.</hi> 487. among the <hi>Memoirs of King</hi> James, where he saith; <hi>And here I cannot omit, that after this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Discovery, his Catholick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty sent an Agent, on purpose to Congratulate King</hi> James <hi>his

               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:62633:32"/>It was likewise fit, that the minds of so many People, whose Humour in the late Fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was <hi>desperare de Republicâ,</hi> should be fortified with Reason: And that the popular <hi>Nusance</hi> of <hi>FEARS AND IEALOV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIES</hi> should be removed, and which you have so much <hi>ex pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesso</hi> (I think) beyond any of our late Writers done.</p>

And I will hereupon say, that if any <hi>Loyal</hi> Roman-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick would not on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what you have said in those two pages, absolve you from his severe Censuring of the warmest passages against Popery, in your whole <hi>Discourse,</hi> he would injure his own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And the Truth is, <hi>Arch-Bishop Hutton's</hi> minding Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> so boldly from the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> though yet with a <hi>Salvo</hi> to the Rules of Modesty, and <hi>Decorum,</hi> of what in Justice concerned her as to K. <hi>Iames</hi>'s Succession; which you have
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62633:35"/>
mentioned, and which was by her so well taken, was not a harder Task to be performed, than what you presented to the consideration of his Late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty from the <hi>Press,</hi> in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of his preserving the <hi>Line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> Succession of his present <hi>Majesty.</hi>

            <p>As it is natural to Men, on the sight of any Combatants or Wrestlers, whom they had never before seen, to wish bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the one, than the other; and to have their <hi>Fancy's</hi> by the <hi>Current</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> constantly carryed along, to favour the Fortunes of this or that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender, whom yet they never saw, so I have during the course of our long acquaintance, obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in you on all occasions, a

Natural cause, in some degree, of Men's being Animated to bring them to effect.</hi>

               <hi>God</hi> be thanked that such as in the late <hi>Conjuncture,</hi> troubled us with the being <hi>Lachrymists</hi> in

            </p>
            <p>We have had presently after the Kings coming to the Throne, a little <hi>Cloud</hi> of Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cast on the Reputations of four of the most Eminent <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> of our <hi>Metropolis,</hi> by some of their fellow Subiects, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Roman Catholicks; but it soon <hi>passed</hi> off: And God

               <hi>brought forth their Righteousness as the Light, and their Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as the Noon-Day:</hi> And the thing scarce deserves to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that after they had thus <hi>misrepresented</hi> four such Protestant <hi>Divines</hi> with so much falshood, some others of those published a Book, called <hi>The Papist Misrepresented, and Represented,</hi> and which is late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly answer'd with that Candour and Strength of Reason, that ought to be in <hi>Theological</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; and wherein as the Lord <hi>Falkeland</hi> who was then Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, was wont to say, <hi>it was as absurd to mingle angry reviling expressions, as to do so in a Love-Letter.</hi> There was a despicable Childish <hi>Pamphlet</hi> (and Writ with too much <hi>petulant</hi> inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence)

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62633:39"/>
               <hi>Iames</hi>'s you refer to, is called <hi>A Manuduction or Introduction unto Divinity, containing a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of Papists by Papists,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by</hi> Tho. James, <hi>Doctor of Divinity, late fellow of New-Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Oxford, and Sub Dean of the Cathedral Church of</hi> Wells, <hi>printed at</hi> Oxford. 1625.</p>
            <p>The Book is full of great Learning, and Dedicated to the then <hi>Lord Keeper, Bishop of</hi> Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln:
And there under his third <hi>proposition,</hi> (viz.) the <hi>King is not Subject to any Foreign Iurisdiction,</hi> he tells us in p. 40. <q>that K. <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. being at Variance with the Pope, a Parliament was called within two years, and a Motion was made therein, that the King should be declared Head of the

Church. But his Majesty refused, till he had Advised with his Universities, of that point. And whilst the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament Sate, (God, in whose Hand the Hearts of Princes are, so disposing it) the King reflecting belike on <hi>Wickliffs</hi> former Articles, directing his Letters to the University of <hi>Ox.</hi> about Electing the Bp. of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> into the Chancellor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the University of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> in the room of Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Warham</hi> lately Deceased; After the Accomplishment whereof (<hi>saith the King</hi>) our Pleasure and Commandment is, that ye, as shall beseem Men of Vertue and profound lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, diligently intreating, examining, and discussing a

<q>Upon the Receipt of these Letters, the University (at that time for ought we know, consisting all of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists) being assembled in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, Decreed as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; That for the Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Determination and Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this question, sent unto them to be Discuss'd from the Kings Majesty; whether the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had any great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Jurisdiction Collated upon him from God in the Holy Scripture, than any other Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Bishop; that there should be Deputed thirty Divines, Doctors and Batchelors of Divinity to whose Sentence, Assertion or Determination,

or the greater part of them, the Common Seal of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, in the Name thereof should be annexed: And then sent up to his Majesty.

Mighty Prince and Lord, <hi>Hen.</hi> the 8<hi>th.</hi> by the Grace of God, of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> King, Defender of the Faith, and Lord of <hi>Ireland,</hi> upon the continual Requests and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of his Subjects, Exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto him in Parliament, against the intolerable exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Foreign Jurisdictions, and upon divers Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies had, and moved about the Jurisdiction and Power of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>; and for other divers and urgent Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses against the said Bishop then and there expounded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared; was sent unto, and humbly desired, that he would provide in time some fit Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and satisfie the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of his dear Subjects: He,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62633:42"/>
as a most prudent <hi>Solomon,</hi> minding the good of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, over whom God hath placed him; and deeply ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with himself, how he might make good and wholsom Laws for the Government of his Common-Wealth; and above all things, taking care that nothing be there resolved upon against the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>; (which he is, and ever will be ready to Defend with Hazard of his Dearest Blood) out of his deep Wisdom, and after great pains taken herea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, hath Transmitted, and sent unto his University of <hi>Oxon,</hi> a certain question to be Disputed, <hi>viz.</hi> whether the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> hath any great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Jurisdiction granted to him
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62633:43"/>
from God in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to be exercised and used in this Kingdom, than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Foraign Bishop; and hath commanded us, that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting the question, after a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and mature Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Examination of the premisses, we should certifie his Majesty, under the Common Seal of our University, what is the true meaning of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in that behalf, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Judgments and Apprehensions. We therefore the Chancellor, Doctors and Masters above Recited, daily and often remembring, and altogether weighing with our selves how good and godly a thing it is, and Congrous to our Profession, befitting our
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62633:43"/>
Submissions, Obediences and Charities, to foreshew the way of Truth and Righteousness, to as many as desire to tread in her steps; and with a good, sure and quiet Conscience, to Anchor themselves upon Gods Word: We could not but endeavour our selves, with all the possible care that we could devise, to satisfie so Just and Reasonable a Request of so great a Prince (who next un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God, is our most Happy and Supream Moderator and Governor.) Taking therefore the said question into our Considerations, with all Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Devotion, and due Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence (as becometh us) and Assembling our Divines toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from all parts, taking

time enough, and many days space to Deliberate thereof di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, religiously, and in the fear of God, with zealous and upright Minds; first searching, and searching again the Book of God, and the best Interpreters thereupon dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the said questions, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly and Publickly in our Schools, have in the end, una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously, and with joynt consent, resolved upon the Conclusion; that is to say, That the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> hath no greater Jurisdiction given unto him in Scripture, than any other Bishop, in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>England</hi>: Which our Assertion, Sentence, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, so upon delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration maturely and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62633:50"/>
great and necessary use, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the effectual withstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Papal Usurpations; and was <hi>re verâ,</hi> the <hi>gaining of a Pass</hi>; and for which end, he made use of intellectual <hi>Detachments</hi> from his <hi>Vniversities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And suitably to the Wisdom of our Ancestors here, in <hi>Henry</hi> 8<hi>ths.</hi> time, any <hi>Popish</hi> Prince a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, who intends effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Combat the <hi>Papal</hi> Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, must first <hi>gain</hi> that <hi>Pass</hi>: For the effect of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sayings in <hi>Natural</hi> Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, that, <hi>Natura non conjungit extrema nisi per media,</hi> and that <hi>Natura non facit Saltum,</hi> must likewise obtain in <hi>Politicks,</hi> when the Nature of things is operating there toward a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Church or <hi>State.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:62633:51"/>And this weighty <hi>Rescript</hi> of the <hi>Vniversity</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Printed in Dr. <hi>Burnets</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Historical <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> nor yet in <hi>Fox</hi> his <hi>Martyrology</hi>; and now Publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here, as set down in <hi>English,</hi> by Dr. <hi>Iames,</hi> may perhaps serve usefully to illuminate the World abroad, about the way of its <hi>Transitus</hi> from Popery.</p>
            <p>But here I shall observe, that though I find, in Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> his <hi>Acts and Monuments</hi> Printed in 3 <hi>Volumes</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> for the Company of <hi>Stationers, An.</hi> 1641. the <hi>Iudgment</hi> of the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity</hi> of <hi>Cambridge</hi> is there set down, in <hi>p.</hi> 338. and relates to the same year with the <hi>Oxford Rescript,</hi> namely the year 1534. yet it doth not there appear to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62633:51"/>
be a Rescript to King <hi>Henry</hi> 8<hi>th.</hi> by way of return to a <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> from his Majesty; and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins thus: <hi>Vniversis sanctae Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris Ecclesiae filijs, ad quos prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentes literae perventurae sunt; Caetus omnis Regentium &amp; non Regentium Academiae Cantabrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ensis, salutem in omnium Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore Iesu Christo.

And then follows the Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole in <hi>English</hi>; and which makes about half of that page 338, and wherein the same Judgment for substance is given, with that of the <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford Rescripts: That the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>hath no more State Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Iurisdiction given him of God in the Scriptures over this Realm of</hi> England, <hi>than any
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62633:52"/>
other extern Bishop hath.</hi> That <hi>Instrument</hi> hath not there the <hi>Date</hi> of any <hi>Month</hi> to it, as the <hi>Oxford Rescript</hi> hath: But in the Body of the Instrument 'tis mentioned, that the <hi>Iudgment</hi> of <hi>that Vniversity</hi> was therein <hi>required,</hi> though not by whom; and towards the Conclusion of it, 'tis Styled an <hi>Answer, in the Name of that Vniversity</hi>; and 'tis probable, that the <hi>Iudgment</hi> of that <hi>Vniversity</hi> might have been <hi>required</hi> by some of the <hi>Ministers</hi> of King <hi>Henry</hi> 8<hi>th.</hi> and by his Order; whereas the <hi>Oxford Rescript,</hi> mentioned his <hi>Majesties</hi> having <hi>himself</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>Iudgment</hi> of that <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity</hi> in that point.</p>
            <p>What I have here mentioned of the <hi>Iudgment</hi> of our two <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities,</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:62633:52"/>
gives me occasion to take notice of an <hi>Oversight</hi> of my <hi>Lord Herbert,</hi> in this place of his <hi>History,</hi> by me Cited; For he in this <hi>p.</hi> 408. makes <hi>the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities Determining, that the Pope had no Iurisdiction warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him by Gods Word in this Kingdom</hi>; whereas he <hi>should</hi> have Represented their <hi>Sense</hi> of his not having <hi>more</hi> here, than any other Foraign Bishop. And thus you truly express the Sense of their Judgment in this Case, when you say <hi>p.</hi> 70<hi>th.</hi> of your Book, that <hi>the Popes Cards were, by the Clergy that plaid his Game, thrown up, as to all claim of more power here by the Word of God, than every other Foraign Bishop had: And both our Vniversities sent their Iudgments about the same
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62633:53"/>
thing to the K.</hi> which, <hi>methinks, might make our Papists approach a little nearer to us, without any fear of Infection. For we allow the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>to have as much power by the Word of God here, as any other Foraign Bishop; and 'tis pity but that the Iudgment of our Vniversities, were shewn the World in Print, and sent to the</hi> French <hi>King; and particularly the Iudgment or Rescript of the Vniversity of</hi> Oxford, <hi>as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any where in Print as I know of; But in an Old Book of Dr.</hi> James's, <hi>against Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as to your thought of having that <hi>Rescript</hi> of the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> sent to the <hi>French</hi> King; I for my part, am disinclined to it. The printing of it here, may probably bring
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62633:53"/>
it to the notice of his Ministers, and so perhaps to his. I have heard how the <hi>French</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador, not long ago ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to a Learned Friend of ours, of the long Robe, and of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; and one who is a great <hi>Antiquary,</hi> and desired him to furnish him with <hi>Copies</hi> of <hi>Records</hi> not prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Dr. <hi>Burnets</hi> Works, that related to <hi>Henry</hi> 8<hi>th's</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> withstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Papal</hi> Usurpation; and no doubt but the <hi>Copy</hi> of this <hi>Oxford Rescript,</hi> would have been as welcom to him, and as necessary to Compleat his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, as any could have been; and the publication of it, may perhaps be of use in some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Roman Catholick World abroad: But I fear, that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62633:54"/>
the present <hi>French</hi> King, will never without some strange un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected provocation, received from the Papacy, advance so far towards the confines of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, as <hi>Henry</hi> 8<hi>th.</hi> did. I know it was but Congruous to Worldly Politicks (however contrary to Justice) for <hi>French</hi> Kings formerly to use very high Severities to their Protestant Subjects, in the Conjunctures of their quarrelling with the Pope; and this you well observe in <hi>p.</hi> 329. out of the <hi>Book</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>the Policy of the Clergy of France</hi>; Namely, that <hi>the French Kings never made any Assaults on the Papal Power; but what cost their Protestant Subjects very dear.</hi> And of the like Nature, were the <hi>Political</hi> Measures of <hi>Henry</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:62633:54"/>
the 8<hi>th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> here, who at the same time, burn'd his <hi>Protestant</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, for what he called <hi>Heresy,</hi> that he hang'd some of his <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish</hi> ones, for what he called <hi>Treason,</hi> in abetting the Papal <hi>Supremacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know we should not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to <hi>limit</hi> the most <hi>Holy</hi> God, as to what Instruments he shall, or shall not use in the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lioration</hi> of the Affairs of Church or State: But the <hi>French</hi> King is one, I never think of without <hi>Horror.</hi> Nor do I entertain any <hi>idea,</hi> of Gods making any right Lines in the World, by so crooked an Instrument. If <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> must not be allowed by the Course of Providence, to build the Temple; because his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62633:55"/>
had been so much dipp'd in <hi>Blood</hi>; what good to Religion can we <hi>presage</hi> from such a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, as has made all <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> almost one great <hi>Acelda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma?</hi> The great God will, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, take his time to make this Monarch share in the usual fate of <hi>Persecutors,</hi> how prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous soever he may be at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, according to what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly observed out of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> Moralist: That <hi>the Divine Wheels are grinding, and will grind to powder, though they are slow in Motion.</hi> Nor did God think fit to use our <hi>Henry</hi> 8<hi>th.</hi> as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument to contribute towards the building his House here, further than by removing the <hi>Rubbish</hi> of the Papal <hi>Vsurpations,</hi> and by so Signally Acting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62633:55"/>
by compassing the Popes power, to be here reduced to the <hi>level</hi> of that of every other <hi>Foraign</hi> Bishop. This was a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous</hi> thing, and worthy the Sagacity and Politicks of King <hi>Henry,</hi> and his Ministers, and it must however be for his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour acknowledged in our <hi>English</hi> Story.</p>
            <p>The truth is, that it having been so Customary for the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>Rome,</hi> when they met with a weak King here, or one whose Affairs were Embarras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, to <hi>interlope</hi> in their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Concerns; and to presume to dispose of their Crowns and Regalities; it was but Natural, for such a Magnanimous Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch as <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th.</hi> was, to Stake down the Popes Spiritual
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62633:56"/>
power, to that short tedder he did out of the Scriptures, and to allow it to go no further there, than any other Foraign Bishop's. And thus I for my part would never prefer any <hi>Divine</hi> to be my Spiritual <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor,</hi> who claimed my Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Estate: And, as I think, no Lords of Mannors, who had the right of <hi>Advowson,</hi> would present any one to a Living in their gift, who without Sense or Reason, did set up a title to the <hi>Mannor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the very thought of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not rising higher than their Springs, might well serve to mind <hi>Henry</hi> 8<hi>th.</hi> and some of our former Roman Catholick Princes, that the Power of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> in Temporals,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62633:56"/>
however Claimed by Popes, was not allowed to rise higher than St. <hi>Peter's,</hi> nor St. <hi>Peter's</hi> higher than his, who said his <hi>Kingdom was not of this World,</hi> and that St. <hi>Peter's</hi> Successor, is not like <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> to tread on the <hi>Heads</hi> of Christians, nor like <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to <hi>Tread</hi> on the Neck of an <hi>Emperor</hi> and <hi>Burlesquing</hi> one of King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> Psalms; <hi>Super aspidem &amp; basiliscum ambulabis, conculcabis l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A Man cannot throughly
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62633:57"/>
Write of the Old <hi>Papal</hi> Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations here, without being as voluminous as Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi>; and our <hi>Statute-Book</hi> doth suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently instruct us out of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8<hi>th's</hi> Reign, and former ones in the <hi>Fact</hi> of the <hi>Papal</hi> Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, and in the <hi>Fact</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> of their being withstood. But I need not tell you of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Observation, that those Statutes in <hi>Henry</hi> 8<hi>th</hi>'s time, that were most warm against the <hi>Papal</hi> Usurpations, were but Declarative of our old Laws and Customs; and as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the <hi>dernier Ressort,</hi> that the <hi>Cannon</hi> Law gives the Pope, of <hi>Appeals</hi> from our Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Courts, was an Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, long before the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th's.</hi> time for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62633:57"/>
all Appeals out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>: And thus the Constitutions at <hi>Clarendon,</hi> plainly speak out, how our Old Laws and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms were to be observed in this point, <hi>viz.</hi> That all <hi>Appeals</hi> must proceed regularly from the <hi>Arch Deacon</hi> to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> from the <hi>Bishop,</hi> to the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi>; and if the Arch-Bishop failed to do Justice, the last Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint must be to the <hi>King,</hi> to give Order for Redress (<hi>i e.</hi>) by proper <hi>delegates</hi>: and <hi>Mathew Paris, A.</hi> 1164. thus tells us, that in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the Custom then about <hi>Appeals</hi> was, viz. <hi>Si emerserint ab Archidiacono, debet procedi ad Episcopum, ab Episcopo ad Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>episcopum &amp; si Archiepiscopus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuerit

            <p>But there is another use we may now well make of the <hi>publication</hi> of this <hi>Rescript</hi> of the <hi>Vniversity</hi> of <hi>Oxon</hi>; and that is to observe how <hi>awkwardly</hi> and <hi>unseasonably</hi> the Author of <hi>The Papist Misrepresented, and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,</hi> hath thought fit to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the <hi>Pope</hi> as now dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a Claim to a Higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er here by the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> than what our Roman-Catholick Universities allowed him in <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th's</hi> time.
For in his 18<hi>th. Chapter,</hi> he tells us, <q>That the Papist believes, that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62633:61"/>
there is a Pastor, Governor, and Head of Christs Church under Christ, to wit the <hi>Pope,</hi> or <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> who is the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to whom Christ committed the Care of his Flock, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Pope to enjoy his Dignity, he looks on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self obliged to shew him the Respect, Submission and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which is due to his place. <hi>And afterward,</hi> in this manner is he ready to behave himself towards his <hi>CHIEF PASTOR,</hi> with all Reverence and Submission, never scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling to receive his Decrees and Definitions, such as are issued forth by his Authority, with all their due Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and according to Law, in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62633:61"/>
the concern of the whole Flock,</q>
            </p>

               <q>How doth it appear that Christ ever made St. <hi>Peter</hi> Head of the Church, or committed his Flock to him, in contradistinction to the Rest of the Apostles?

It is lawful for a Person of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to kill a Man, that intends to Calumniate him, if there is no other way to avoid that Reproach</hi>; was in that <hi>Decree,</hi> very justly Condemn'd: And but for that <hi>Principle,</hi> having till its <hi>Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> been <hi>approved</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; there could

be no more just cause to charge any Papist, except the Actors, with the Blood of <hi>Godfrey,</hi> than there was to cast the <hi>odium</hi> of the Execrable Murder of the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> on any of the Presbyterians, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Ruffianly <hi>Actors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to the case of <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey,</hi> I remember you told me, <hi>that since your warm aggravations about it in your DISCOVRSE, you were a colder Concurrer with the Iustice of the Nation therein, and that you, thought there was still somwhat of the</hi> Intervallum <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> made so <hi>little</hi> about it, shall not now make any at all. What I have read in a Pacificatory <hi>Discourse,</hi> of a Pious <hi>Divine,</hi> published in the <hi>year</hi> 1653. where speaking of a Spirit of <hi>Iealousie,</hi> and of <hi>envy, strife, Railings, and Evil Surmisings,</hi> and having <hi>quoted</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.4. and <hi>that Strife and evil surmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, are near of kinne; and that if Contentious Men can get nothing against their Brethren, they will surmise there is something, and if they can find nothing in their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Iudge, they will Iudge their Hearts: If there be nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-board, they will think there may be something under-board; and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62633:74"/>
from thinking there MAY BE something; they will think it is very LIKELY there is something; and from LIKELY THERE IS, they will conclude THERE IS, surely there is some PLOT working</hi>; hath still since inclined me to be <hi>cautious,</hi> how in my most private thoughts I charged any Men, and especially, any great Bodies of Men, with <hi>PLOTS:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I think the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>the Papist Mis-represented,</hi> &amp;c. will find enough Protestants as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as you and my self, to avoid troubling them with the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi> Plot.</p>
            <p>But since the <hi>Author</hi> hath in this <hi>case,</hi> thought fit to <hi>invite</hi> us to a <hi>view</hi> of the <hi>Principles APPROVED,</hi> and <hi>Conform to the Religion taught by his Church,</hi> I
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62633:75"/>
shall, reflecting on the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> approved by so many in that <hi>Church,</hi> tell him, I cannot but Judge them short of that <hi>unconditional</hi> Loyalty, you have so clearly <hi>asserted</hi> in your <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussion</hi>; and shall judge, as the <hi>L. Falkland</hi> the <hi>Secretary</hi> did, in the <hi>Letter</hi> to Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> I before referred to, where his <hi>Lordship</hi> on Mr. <hi>Mountagues</hi> making <hi>POPERY the way to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,</hi> having had these words, viz.
<q>I cannot but say, that though no <hi>Tenet</hi> of their whole Church (which I know) makes at all against it; yet there are prevailing opinions of that side, which are not fit to make good Subjects, when their Kings and they are of different perswasions; <hi>and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62633:75"/>
having quoted D'</hi> Ossat, for say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it is the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Maxim, that Faith is not to be kept with Hereticks, and more, that the Pope intimated as much in a Discourse, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to perswade the King of <hi>France</hi> to forsake the Queen of <hi>England</hi>; and that they hold at <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Pope to avoid a probable Danger of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing of Heresy, may take away a Territory from the true owner, and dispose of it to another; and many also defend, that he hath power to Depose an Heretical Prince, and of Heresy, he makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the Judge:</q> 
               <hi>His Lordship with a profound Charity and Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thus goeth on, viz.</hi>
               <q>So that though I had rather my
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62633:76"/>
Tongue should cleave to the Roof of my Mouth, than that I should deny that a Papist may be a good Subject, even to a King, whom he accounts an Heretick; since I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that I my self know very many very good: Yet Popery is like to an ill Air, wherein, though many keep their Healths, yet many are Infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (so that at most, they are good Subjects; but during the Popes pleasure) and the rest are in more danger, than if they were out of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, as to the <hi>firing</hi> of <hi>London</hi>; which the <hi>Author</hi> referreth to, in his <hi>Papist Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>represented,</hi> as well as the <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Godfrey,</hi> I was always as careful as you were, to charge
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62633:76"/>
no more Papists with the <hi>Odium</hi> of it, than such as the Justice of the Nation Criminated therewith. Moreover, if any one will have it, that <hi>Hubert</hi> and <hi>Peidelow</hi> were not <hi>Papstis,</hi> I shall not account it <hi>tanti,</hi> to contend with him about it, and as you told me lately, that you would not I remember when we were long since Discoursing of that <hi>fire,</hi> you shewed me a <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Vigelius</hi> a <hi>Civilian,</hi> who <hi>treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, de praesumptionibus quaesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onum facti,</hi> laid it down as a particular Rule, <hi>viz.

            <p>But since our Roman-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick <hi>Author,</hi> in his <hi>Papist Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>represented,</hi> doth partly found the <hi>Mis-representation,</hi> on these execrable <hi>practices</hi> having been done according to the known <hi>Principles</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> I shall take this occasion he hath given me, to offer it to him, to consider how far any known <hi>principle,</hi> founded on the Papal Usurpations, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved either <hi>BY</hi> or <hi>IN</hi> that

                              <p>In the 24<hi>th.</hi> place, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether a whole City may be burn'd, or otherwise destroyed, in which are some Hereticks? And the gloss on the Canon, <hi>Si audieris,</hi> argues, that 'tis so by the Text. And <hi>Iohannes</hi> &amp; <hi>Laurentius,</hi> seem to be of opinion that any Person whatsoever, may do it. But other Authorities are brought for the contrary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Archidiaconus</hi> saith, that the Church doth grant the general power of Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating Hereticks. And by the Authorities Cited, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62633:87"/>
for so doing, is not only directed to Princes: And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, the Indulgence is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Cruce signati,</hi> for the exterminating Hereticks: But as to the killing and despoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such, it is safe, that it be done by the Edict of the Prince, or the Church: Lest any should seem to fight ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of Lust or Revenge, than out of Justice or Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the which <hi>Raynerius</hi> doth also assert, and likewise <hi>Gof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fredus</hi> and <hi>Hostiensis. Iohan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Andreas,</hi> goes in the same Track, who subjoyns, that the Declaration of a Judg on the Crime of Heresie, ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily to precede to the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that execution be so done. But those things seem
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62633:88"/>
to me (under favour) to be too crudely and indigestly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: And in so great a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, where the danger of so many is treated of, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, where the innocent are punished for the guilty, the Subject is to be Writ of more gravely, and more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly; and ones pen was to have been more temper'd. Wherefore I would say, that though some of a City are Hereticks, yet while the City it self hath not incurr'd the guilt of Heresie, and so that that Crime cannot be ascribed to the Body of the City, it may not therefore be burn'd, or otherwise destroyed; For this is not found ordered by any Law. Nay, the Laws are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62633:88"/>
to the contrary; Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that Sins ought only to reach to their Authors.</p>
                              <p>To the Laws that are brought to the contrary, the Answer is clear, and to the Canon, <hi>Si audieris,</hi> by which the gloss doth found it self, much may be said: As first, that that was a Precept of the Old Judicial Law, as appears clearly. For 'tis found in the 13<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> And commands of that kind ceased to oblige under the new Law, unless the institution thereof, had been renewed. Nor do we read of any such new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution: For <hi>Cyprian,</hi> to whom that Text in the <hi>Decrets</hi> is ascribed, had not the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of issuing out the General
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62633:89"/>
Laws (for as much, as he was not Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>) nor es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in a Case, wherein or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is given concerning Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Death; as appears in the Text, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Or otherwise you may say, that, that Text doth not speak of Hereticks, but of Idolaters; and those Crimes are different, as appears out of what hath been before said.</p>
                              <p>And again, otherwise it may be said, that it speaks so, when all Persons of a City were infected with that Crime. And if they were not all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, yet that was lawful at that time, while there was a Command of God for it, who is the Lord of Life and Death; and for which, there
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62633:89"/>
is a good Text, where menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made of <hi>Sampson</hi>'s Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide. But to the other Laws which <hi>Archidiaconus</hi> ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, 'tis answered, that those things were done by Gods Authority, who did inwardly inspire the Authority of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it is to be said, that he speaks, when these things were done by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Judge, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the end of the Text, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>And as to somewhat else Cited, you may say, that 'tis understood, when in a lawful Case, War was waged against them; and there was added also to that the Authority of a Superior, who could grant it: Otherwise this Absurdity
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62633:90"/>
would follow; that for an Act unlawful, and disallowed, the Pope might grant Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; which are only to be granted for a work of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: According to what is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Doctors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for which the Text makes, for as much as Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> holds out of the same 4. <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiarum. distinc.</hi> 20.</p>
                              <p>The Result of the whole, will rest here, that if a City doth fall into Heresie, then it may be burn'd and destroy'd, and not otherwise.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Bartolus</hi> Confirms this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution in the Case of Heresie, and of Treason, and in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cases where the Son is punished for the offence of the Father. And thus it was done
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62633:90"/>
in the Case of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which for its Rebellion, was plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, as appears in the <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dects.</hi> He saith likewise, that he saw the Definitive Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Henry</hi> the Emperor, which he gave against the City of <hi>Brixia,</hi> that Rebelled against him, wherein he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, that the City was to be ploughed up: The which punishment he afterward out of his Mercy released, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus <hi>Boniface</hi> did, who by reason of the faults of some of the Templars, destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their whole order, because they were Hereticks.</p>
                              <p>But none inferior to a Prince, can give this Sentence, nor can it be done, without the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a Prince, according
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62633:91"/>
to what <hi>Bartolus</hi> doth at large pursue.
<hi>And</hi> Salycet <hi>was of the same Opinion.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>But when shall we say, that a City commits Heresie, so that it may be punished in the manner aforesaid?</p>
                              <p>I Answer, then, if they were all Hereticks, or the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part: And it is requisite that they should meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a Community to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this Crime; Namely, by joynt Councels. Otherwise single Persons would be said to do it and not the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor would I have you believe by this, that the Innocent are punished with Corporal Punishment for the guilty, which appears mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly from what is said by <hi>Bartolus, &amp;c.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="139" facs="tcp:62633:91"/>
But accrding to the premis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, the question is, Whether the Community being punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Heresie, every single Person be deem'd to be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ished so, as that he may be judged to be severally punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it; and so ought not to be punished further?</p>
                              <p>To this I Answer, that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons singly, may neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less be punished, if they are found guilty of this Crime; because what the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty doth owe, Persons do not singly, and so on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For this Decision, those things do serve, that are noted by <hi>Ioannes</hi> and the Moderns, and by <hi>Barto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</hi>

            <p>Yet here in this place, I have Cited out of <hi>Gundissalvus,</hi> it is worthy of observation, that some passages may render him appearing no <hi>Slave</hi> to <hi>Impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit</hi> Faith, or one as I may say that roweth in the <hi>Popes</hi> Galleys. His Judging of the Case, as he did with so much <hi>Horror,</hi> was very Commendable in him; as was likewise his reproof of the <hi>Cannonists</hi> by him <hi>Cited</hi>; and his saying that <hi>ones pen was to have been more tempered,</hi> and his differing from the measures of the <hi>Text</hi> and <hi>Gloss</hi> about the Canon <hi>Si audieris,</hi> and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the 13<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy</hi> and answering the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection thence taken, and from

            <p>I am not now to tell you, what you have so long known of me, <hi>viz.</hi> That I never was a Lover of the <hi>Canon</hi> Law: And that though I always had a great Honour for the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the <hi>Civil</hi> Law, yet as I never thought better of the <hi>Canon</hi> Law, than <hi>Albericus Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilis</hi> did in his 9<hi>th. Chapter,</hi> and Second Book, <hi>De Nuptijs,</hi> where he saith, <hi>sed hoc jus brutum &amp; barbarum sanè est, natum in tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bris Saeculorum Spississimis, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductum a Monacho, Tenebrione,</hi> &amp;c. So my finding particularly <hi>Cyprian</hi> so miserably abused in the <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Si audieris,</hi> hath made me the more to <hi>Nauseate</hi>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:62633:96"/>
it. For it is evident, that the place in <hi>Cyprian,</hi> doth not prove what <hi>Gratian</hi> proposeth, <hi>viz.</hi> That a whole <hi>City</hi> now under the <hi>Gospel,</hi> may be burned for a few <hi>Hereticks</hi> inhabiting in it.</p>
            <p>'Tis plain, that <hi>Cyprian's</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign there is to encourage all good Christians, rather to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Martyrdom, than to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Idolatry, by Worshipping <hi>other</hi> Gods; that being the <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> and <hi>Subject</hi> of the <hi>Epistle, De exhortatione Martyrij</hi>; and in order to this, he shews Gods great Hatred, and severe punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Idolatry, Namely, from <hi>Deut.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

'Tis therefore plain, that this severe Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> concerned only the <hi>Cities</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi>; the words in that <hi>Text</hi> being <hi>One of THY Cities, which the Lord thy God hath Given THEE.</hi> And as the <hi>Law</hi> under that penalty, was given only to the <hi>Iews</hi> in <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> so it obliged them only, and not any other People of any other Country. Moreover as to the Words in the <hi>Text,</hi> viz. <hi>withdraw the Inhabitants of their
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62633:97"/>
City, and which Gratian</hi> thought fit to leave out, they may be said to be Indefinite, and may mean all the Inhabitants: And then it was evidently Just, to kill them all, according to the words in <hi>Cyprian, Etiam si uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versa Civitas consenserit ad ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lolatriam.</hi> But if the <hi>Major</hi> part be not indeed meant then, if you will consult <hi>Ainsworths</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Commentary, on <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13. you will find, that the <hi>Doctors</hi> among the <hi>Iews,</hi> say, that if a <hi>Major</hi> part of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be drawn to Idolatry, then that <hi>Major</hi> part shall be slain, and the City be burned. But if the <hi>Minor</hi> part only be drawn to Idolatry, then they say, that <hi>Minor</hi> part shall be Slain; but the City shall not be burnt. This
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62633:97"/>
the <hi>Iewish</hi> Doctors, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood that <hi>Text,</hi> much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than <hi>Gratian</hi> or <hi>Iohn Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meca</hi> his <hi>Glossator,</hi> took to be the meaning of that <hi>Text,</hi> and so likewise many Learned Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians did.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyprian</hi> then having shewn how great a Sin <hi>Idolatry</hi> was; and how hateful it was to God, he adds, <hi>Si ante Adventum Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti Circa Deum Colendum &amp; Idola Spernenda haec precepta servata sunt, quanto magis post adventum Christi servanda sunt?</hi> But we know, <hi>Mosaical precepts</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are either <hi>De officijs,</hi> or <hi>de poenis.</hi> And as to the former, namely, <hi>Moral</hi> Offices, or <hi>Duty</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and our <hi>Neighbour</hi>; Of precepts for these <hi>Cyprian</hi> says, that if they were observed before <hi>Christ,</hi>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:62633:98"/>
then <hi>quantò magis post adventum Christi,</hi> &amp;c. who had in his <hi>Sermon</hi> on the <hi>Mount,</hi> fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, and given us the true meaning of them. And the clearer understanding of any Laws, doth certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a stronger Obligation from them: And hence it is, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> thinks truly that Christians are more <hi>strictly</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to observe the <hi>Moral</hi> Law, than the <hi>Iews</hi> were. But the Laws <hi>de paenis &amp; supplicijs, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> doth not at all mention, nor in that place intend or mean. For Christians are not bound to inflict the same punishments on the Transgressours of the Law, to which the <hi>Iews</hi> by the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Law were bound. For to the <hi>Iews</hi> Adultery, or breach
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62633:98"/>
of the Sabbath, were <hi>Capital</hi> Crimes: But not so among the Christians. Theft was not Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital by <hi>Moses</hi> his Law: Yet by the Law of <hi>England</hi> it is. By the <hi>Iews</hi> Law, it was <hi>an Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth</hi>; but our Blessed Lord declares against that severity, as not to be used amongst <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</hi> And yet our <hi>Monarchus Tenebrio,</hi> would have <hi>Cyprian</hi> understood <hi>de poenis</hi>; and against Truth and the Sense of <hi>Cyprian</hi> concludes, that because <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> was by the <hi>Iews</hi> Law pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ished with Death, therefore it should be so punished, since <hi>Christ,</hi> under the Gospel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gratian</hi> ends his Quotation out of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> with these words, viz. <hi>Si ante adventum Christi
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62633:99"/>
haec praecepta servata sunt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to magis post adventum servanda sunt, quando ille veniens non verbis tantum nos hortatus est, sed &amp; factis?</hi> By which words he would prove, that our Lord did both by <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Deeds,</hi> exhort us to <hi>Kill</hi> Hereticks: Whereas there is not one word in <hi>Cyprian,</hi> or the <hi>Texts</hi> of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he Cites, which any way concerns <hi>Hereticks</hi> or <hi>Heresie</hi>; but only <hi>Idolaters</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which are things of a far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Nature. And had <hi>Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> considered what immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follows there in <hi>Cyprian</hi> (and which he there unluckily leaves out) he might have clearly seen that <hi>Cyprian</hi> neither said nor meant, that the <hi>Meek</hi> and the <hi>Holy Iesus,</hi> did, by <hi>Deeds</hi> or
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62633:99"/>
               <hi>Words,</hi> Exhort Men to kill <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</hi> But that which <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> truly saith, our Blessed <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> did by <hi>Deeds</hi> and <hi>Words</hi> Exhort us to, was that <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> should patiently suffer, and by no means renounce the Gospel by serving Idols, and by Idolatry. For as to those words with which <hi>Gratian</hi> ends his <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Christus veniens non verbis tantum nos hortatus est, sed factis,</hi> there should have been only a <hi>Comma</hi> after <hi>factis,</hi> though <hi>Gratian</hi> makes a <hi>full</hi> point, as if it <hi>concluded the</hi> Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. It immediately follows in <hi>Cyprian</hi> thus, viz. <hi>Non ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis tantum nos hortatus sit, sed &amp; factis, post omnes Injurias &amp; contumelias passus &amp; Crucifixus, ut nos pati &amp; mori exemplo suo
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:62633:100"/>
doceret, ut nulla sit homini ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusatio pro se (pro Christo) non patienti, Cum ille passus sit pro nobis, &amp;c.</hi> In short, that which <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith, Christ taught us with <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Deeds</hi> was not, that we should <hi>Kill</hi> Hereticks, as <hi>Gratian</hi> would have it; but that we should willingly suffer Death for the Gospel, rather than be Idolaters.</p>
            <p>We know that in the case of the <hi>Samaritans</hi> (who were both <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Idolaters</hi>) when <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> would have had <hi>fire</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume them,</hi> our Blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> Rebuked them, and said, that <hi>the Son of Man was not come to destroy Mens Lives; but to save them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Because I love to make no
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62633:100"/>
breach among Christians wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and because in <hi>p.</hi> 260. you have, in general, mentioned <hi>Gratian</hi>'s Misciting of <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
and in <hi>p.</hi> 261. shewed that <hi>Gratian's</hi> founding a <hi>Tenet</hi> on <hi>Cyprian,</hi> or any places out of other <hi>Authors,</hi> giveth it only the weight that <hi>Cyprian</hi> and they had in their proper Works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have here thought it worth while, to shew that <hi>Papists</hi> are under no <hi>Moral</hi> Obligation by this <hi>Canon, Si audieris,</hi> and do believe, that the more Sagacious Persons of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> do (as is said in <hi>Pere verons</hi> Book, you in the page last ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted refer to) make <hi>Gratian</hi>'s <hi>Decrees,</hi> and the <hi>gloss</hi> claime no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of <hi>Faith,</hi> and so even in the country's of the Pope,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:62633:101"/>
where the <hi>Canon</hi> Law is in force, this part of the <hi>Decrees,</hi> so wilfully mistaken by <hi>Gratian</hi>
out of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> can bind none in Conscience.</p>
            <p>And therefore as to what you mention of the Roman Catholick Gentlemans obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> had gone far in the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Canon</hi> Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I account you have said enough to <hi>Answer</hi> that <hi>Objection</hi>: For though the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> hath it in the 25<hi>th. Session</hi> C. 20. <hi>De Reformatione</hi> p 623, 624. of the <hi>Edition</hi> at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> in the year 1033 that <hi>Praecipit sancta synodus sacros canones, &amp; conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia generalia omnia, necnon alias Apostolicas sanctiones in favorem Ecclesiasticarum personarum, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertatis

Ecclesiasticae, &amp; contra ejus violatores editas quae omnia praesenti decreto innovat, exactè ab omnibus observari debere</hi>; tho' other expressions in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, may seem to confirm some parts of the <hi>Canon</hi> Law, they cannot (I think) Rationally be extended to confirm any thing therein that was void, <hi>ab initio,</hi> and so not obligatory, and as this <hi>Canon, Si audieris,</hi> appears not to be, by <hi>Gratians</hi> falsificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as to <hi>Cyprian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how far a <hi>Tenet</hi> or <hi>Principle</hi> of this Nature, branded by no <hi>Index expurgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> is yet chargeable on the <hi>Papacy</hi> as <hi>approved</hi> by it, I leave to consideration, and do think it great pitty, that when a <hi>Pope</hi> could find leisure by a <hi>Bull,</hi> that

I find King <hi>Iames</hi> the I. men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in his Works, as begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with, <hi>Exurge Deus,</hi> to Damn among other sayings, that of <hi>Luther, Nova vita est optima paenitentia</hi>; he did not find time to censure this thing in his <hi>Canon</hi> Law.</p>

            <p>Your <hi>p.</hi> 170. contains in it one <hi>Theological</hi> consideration, of more value in my Opinion, than many <hi>Tomes</hi> of <hi>Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy,</hi> viz. <hi>that Papists as well as others of Mankind, have a right and title to the free and undistur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Worshipping of God, and the confession of the Principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, purchased for them, by the Blood of Christ</hi>: And the very

            <p>I have here our great Dr. <hi>Iackson</hi> on my side, in thus Judging in his Treatise of the <hi>Church,</hi> 14th. <hi>Chapter,</hi> where having given <hi>two Reasons as just and necessary for which Men may, and ought to separate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from any visible Church,</hi> and named this as the <hi>first</hi>

            <p>I know of none of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who hath avowed the practice of more Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to <hi>Papists</hi> in the Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:62633:105"/>
of their <hi>Religionary</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, than I have done: And I thank God, that my practice in this kind, hath not been by <hi>Fits</hi> or <hi>Starts,</hi> or <hi>Turns</hi> of <hi>Times</hi> or <hi>Humours</hi>; but that my <hi>Life</hi> hath in this <hi>Point</hi> of doing Just and Charitable Offices, to all Consciencious and Loyal <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> been as (I may say) a <hi>Thred</hi> even spun upon every <hi>Wheel</hi> of Providence. Your self can tell of the Signal good Offices I did to many Papists, and to others, that a Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous Common Fame would have run down as <hi>Popishly</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, when you applyed to me then in their behalf, during the Season of some of the late <hi>Narratives</hi>; and I am able fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to do you the Justice, as
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:62633:105"/>
to remember what you have long ago told me (and what I had reason to believe) that when the <hi>figure</hi> you made in another of his Majesties Realms, allowed you <hi>Virtute officij,</hi> to have made many thousands of them groan under the Burden of the Penal Laws, you held your self, in Conscience ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged not to do it, but on the contrary, to rescue them from the least Hardship thereby.</p>
            <p>But I shall here take occasion to tell you, that I have scarce in any thing more shewed my Friendliness to the Persons of some of my Roman Catholick Friends, than by my Advice to them that they would apply to the Writers of their Church, to forbear troubling our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:62633:106"/>
World with new Models of Reconciliation of Churches.</p>
            <p>And indeed, <hi>Nature</hi> doth now Loudly enough tell us, that the <hi>Real</hi> Peace of Kingdoms ought not to be troubled by projects of a <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical</hi> one between Churches. The best Men are Reconciled to one another, and the Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling of all the worst Men in the World together, would make their Association more troublesom to Mankind: And when we know that the Bigots of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can stir no further from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of <hi>Trent,</hi> than our Soldiers in <hi>Africa,</hi> could from their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of <hi>Tangier</hi> before the <hi>Peace,</hi> there is no thinking of their Travelling far to meet
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:62633:106"/>
us. And if any one suppose that they would meet us half way, yet notwithstanding he might likewise according to the Principles of <hi>Nature</hi> suppose that the other Moiety of the <hi>Theological</hi> Controversies not agreed in, would occasionally render Mens Spirits more Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous toward each other, and the publick; as we usually see Storms to be most violent about the Season of the <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial.</hi> Moreover, they who give themselves the <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilers general,</hi> or intrude in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Station of the Publick <hi>Mediators,</hi> appearing thereby hot and unquiet in their own tempers, &amp; rendring themselves always liable to disquiet from abroad, by attacks from all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:62633:107"/>
are of all Men the most unlikely to be universal <hi>Peace-Makers,</hi> or to gain any <hi>Blessing</hi> by being such And as you have in your <hi>Discourse</hi> Studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously declined the use of the little <hi>Names</hi> of <hi>Distinctions</hi> of three differing Parties in the State, so shall I likewise do; but can easily give you occasion to guess which of them refers to Men most Hated, and most Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politick, by Minding you how the <hi>Systematical</hi> Writers of <hi>Politicks</hi> do often call neuters <hi>Middle Region Men,</hi> and such as being Lodged in the <hi>Middle</hi> Rooms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are annoyed with the <hi>droppings</hi> from above, and <hi>smoak</hi> from below.</p>
            <p>You have expressed your self in your <hi>Preface</hi> and <hi>Discourse</hi> as
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:62633:107"/>
so much agreeing with me in this Subject, that I shall be but Just to you, in owning my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that your varying from some of the Measures of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in some Points tended not to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage others to undertake the <hi>Thankless Office</hi> of being <hi>Match-Makers</hi> of <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</hi>
            </p>

understands not the Doctrine of</hi> Luther <hi>or</hi> Calvin, <hi>or</hi> Melanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, <hi>nor the Articles of the Church of</hi> England, &amp;c. <hi>But that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they all agree, and which they all Subscribed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as a perfect Rule of their Faith and Actions, that is, the Bible, the Bible I say, the Bible only is the True Religion of Protestants,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>I have observed a late <hi>French</hi> Writer to avoid the Censure of describing the Communion of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Faith of that Church by a doubtful Name, having used the Term <hi>la Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitè.</hi> But as to your Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Popery,</hi> I may mind you, that according to your

Were it

not for what you have so well in p. 48. said, that <hi>the Protestant Religion not making the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Preist essential to the Sacrament of the</hi> Eucharist, <hi>is more strongly assertive of the Real presence there, than the Popish Hypothesis,</hi> and for that great and excellent Notion of yours, in your <hi>Discourse, viz.</hi> That <hi>Papists and others being</hi> bought with a Price; <hi>that therefore they ought not to be the Servants of Men,</hi> and my Judging that according to what I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned out of Dr, <hi>Iackson,</hi> that you would separate your self from any Church, that impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed any thing Magisterially on Mens Faiths, I might think that perhaps, had you lived in the <hi>Reign</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th,</hi> you

the Rage of Popery,</hi> I may tell you; that this <hi>PROTESTANCY</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to no more than what we read of in the <hi>Review</hi> of the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> where in <hi>Book</hi> 1. and 12<hi>th.

               <hi>Nature</hi> and its <hi>God</hi> meant that all should <hi>ludibrium debere,</hi> that would <hi>Triumph</hi> over <hi>Fallibility</hi> in what Church soever, Our Honest <hi>Monk</hi> whom I lately mentioned, as Decreeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a <hi>Triumph</hi> over that great <hi>observer</hi> of all things he <hi>referr'd</hi> to, I mean the late <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendon,</hi> had in his <hi>Triumphant</hi> Chariot the usual <hi>Compliment</hi> of that <hi>Solemnity,</hi> viz. <hi>Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem te esse cogita,</hi> there put on him by Nature.</p>
            <p>And one might to him Cite <hi>D' Ossats Letters,</hi> and with some <hi>Allusion</hi> to his Words to the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Clarendon</hi> say, that he supposed that <hi>that Cardinal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood the State of the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>relating to</hi> France, <hi>as well as any one, and much better
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:62633:127"/>
than</hi> De Marca, <hi>or any one else who would make its definitions of Faith admitted in</hi> France by an <hi>Edict</hi> in the <hi>year</hi> 1579.</p>
            <p>Let any one for this purpose, who pleases, look on <hi>D' Ossats</hi> Letter from <hi>Rome,</hi> the 19<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> 1596 to <hi>Villeroy,</hi> where he adviseth, that the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> might be <hi>Publisht</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and mentions that the <hi>Clergy</hi> of <hi>France</hi> had often desired a <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication</hi> of it, and saith, that the <hi>Huguenots</hi> by reason of the <hi>Edict</hi> of 77. would not be <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced</hi> by such <hi>publication</hi>; and on another Letter to <hi>Villeroy</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> on the 19<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> 1597, where he again presseth for the <hi>publication</hi> of that <hi>Council,</hi> and saith of it, <hi>La publication sans l' observation,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:62633:128"/>
pourroit plus que l' observation sans la publication</hi>: and that the <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Parliament and others, would have no cause of complaint thereupon, and that a</hi> Salvo <hi>of two or three Lines, would be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy against any complaints,</hi> and on his long <hi>Letter</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> the 28<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> 1599. to <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Fourth,</hi> where he minds him from the <hi>Pope,</hi> that the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> might be <hi>Published,</hi> and saith, <hi>Que la plus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part des Catholiques, &amp; ceux qui plus peuvent Comme les Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens, &amp; les Chapitres, &amp; les principaux Seigneurs, ne veulent point du dit Concile, pour n' avoir point à laisser les benefices incompatibles, les confidences &amp; autres abus quae la Reformation portee par le dit Concile osteroit</hi>;

and on his <hi>Letter</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> the last of <hi>March,</hi> 1599. to <hi>Villeroy,</hi> Animating him to promote the <hi>Publication</hi> of that <hi>Council,</hi> and where he saith, <hi>I never knew that that Council prejudic'd any Regal Right, as some say it hath done; but though it might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice it in some point, it might however be publisht, with adding thereto such a</hi> Salvo <hi>as we could have, Namely, as to the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Preeminences of the Crown, the Authority of the King, the Liberties and Franchises of the</hi> Gallican <hi>Church, the Indults of the Court of Parliament, and the Edicts of Pacification, and all other things that we would have excepted,</hi> and on his long <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Fourth</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> of <hi>Iune</hi> the 11<hi>th.</hi> 1601.

where mentioning his excusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory <hi>replies</hi> to the <hi>Pope,</hi> about the not <hi>publishing</hi> that <hi>Council,</hi> he saith, that <hi>not only the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, but a great part of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks were against it; and that his Holiness might remember how</hi> Henry <hi>the Fourth's Predecessors, could never be brought to publish that Council.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might here mention how Father <hi>Paul</hi> in his <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>Venetian Interdict, p.</hi> 4. and 48. tells us, that the <hi>Trent</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil was not received in <hi>France,</hi> in the <hi>year</hi> 1616, and that <hi>Thuanus</hi> assures us, that the <hi>Trent</hi> Council was not received in <hi>France</hi> in the <hi>year</hi> 1588, and therefore not in the <hi>year</hi> 1579. according to <hi>De Marca.</hi> For that excellent and most
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:62633:129"/>
Faithful <hi>Historian, Tome</hi> the 4<hi>th. lib.</hi> 93. <hi>p.</hi> 361. of his <hi>History,</hi> tells us, that at that <hi>time</hi> (i. e. An. 1588.) <hi>Magno Caloris aestu contentio de Tridentinâ Synodo toties agitata denuô renovata est,</hi> and how <hi>stoutly</hi> the <hi>promulgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of it was opposed.</p>
            <p>And there is the Work of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>French</hi> Historian, that may be here referred to, viz. <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riarum Galliae ab excessu</hi> Hen. 4. <hi>Libri</hi> 18. <hi>Authore</hi> G. B. <hi>Gramon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do in Sacro Regis Consistorio Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natore &amp; in Parliamento Tolosano Praeside. Tolosae</hi> 1643. and where in <hi>p</hi> 57. the Author tells us, that in the <hi>year</hi> 1615. (the year in which <hi>Cressy</hi> out of <hi>Cabassu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> says, the <hi>Clergy</hi> received the <hi>Trent</hi> Council) <hi>Proposita à Clero Concilij Tridentini promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatio,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:62633:130"/>
&amp; molliendae invidiae ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecta est haec clausula sine prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicio Coronae Regiae, &amp; Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatum Gallicanae Ecclesiae,</hi> &amp;c. and that <hi>Cardinal</hi> Peron <hi>spoke Elegantly and Learnedly for it; but that after long debate about the Reception of that Council (es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially between the clergy and the</hi> 3<hi>d. Estate) the issue was, that the third Estate carryed it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Clergy; and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and Promulgation of the</hi> Trent <hi>Council, was absolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,</hi> and (p. 69.) <hi>PRAEVA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LVITQVE CLERO POPV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LVS.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where it is evident. 1. That what <hi>Cabassutius</hi> in his <hi>Notitia Conciliorum, p.</hi> 720. names only a <hi>Convention</hi> of the <hi>Clergy</hi> in that <hi>year</hi> 1615. (as if that had
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:62633:130"/>
been all) was in Truth, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventus trium Regni Ordinum,</hi> a Convention of the <hi>three</hi> Estates, the greatest and Supream Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of <hi>France,</hi> and as <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondus</hi> saith, <hi>p.</hi> 58. 2<hi>dly.</hi> That whereas <hi>Cabassutius</hi> says, the <hi>Trent</hi> Council was received in that General Convention of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Clergy; <hi>De Marca</hi> saith, and evidently proves, that no such <hi>Convention</hi> of the <hi>Gallican Clergy</hi> had any <hi>Authority</hi> to <hi>Receive</hi> or <hi>Promulgate</hi> the <hi>Trent</hi> Council<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or any other. <hi>Approve</hi> it they might; but receive it they could not. But it was so far from being <hi>recieved</hi> by the Convention of the <hi>French cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi> that it was absolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by the Supream Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>three</hi> Estates, and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:62633:131"/>
that after a long and free De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</p>
            <p>It is true and most Notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that not only in <hi>France,</hi> but in <hi>England</hi> heretofore, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Papal</hi> Clergy were generally more addicted to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Papal <hi>Power,</hi> than the Just <hi>Prerogatives</hi> of their own Kings, or the Rights of the Laity: Because as by the <hi>Clergy's</hi> help and assistance the <hi>Papacy</hi> grew greater, their Jurisdiction and Revenues were thereby encreased. And thus <hi>Anselme</hi> and <hi>Becket</hi> being zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the Pope, and Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to their King, found their account in the Pope's Assisting and Favouring them with his Power while they lived, and <hi>Canonizing</hi> them, and making
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:62633:131"/>
them (what their Loyalty could not while they lived) Saints af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Death. But as our Magnanimous Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>Princes</hi> did then bridle the Papal <hi>Power,</hi> so likewise those of <hi>France</hi> have done; and even where <hi>Cabassutius</hi> saith, that the <hi>Trent</hi> Council was <hi>received</hi> in the <hi>year</hi> 1615. <hi>à Clero Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano sub Ludovico</hi> 13. he doth not say that the <hi>King</hi> received it, and thus <hi>De Marca</hi> tells us in his <hi>De Concordiâ Sacerd. &amp; Imperij.</hi> Lib. 2. Cap. 17. S. 7. p. 33. <hi>Decreta Conciliorum legis vim in Gallià non habent, nisi recepta à Clero, &amp; Regiâ Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate munita.</hi> But <hi>De Marca</hi> had in that <hi>Book</hi> informed us, that in the time the <hi>Trent</hi> Council Sate, when it evidently appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:62633:132"/>
by the Decrees of that Councel, the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church was <hi>in quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plurimis apitibus</hi> destroyed, the <hi>Embassadors</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the 9<hi>th.</hi> left the <hi>Synod,</hi> being called home by their Kings: And had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd in that Council, that the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, <hi>&amp; Regia dignitas erant immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutae</hi>; and their <hi>recesse</hi> from and leaving the <hi>Council</hi> was a good reason, as <hi>De Marca</hi> there proves, <hi>non admittendae Synodi (i. e.)</hi> of their not <hi>receiving</hi> that Council.</p>
            <p>Father <hi>Paul</hi> likewise in his <hi>History</hi> of that <hi>Council</hi> saith, that <hi>the French Bishops</hi> left it on the same account.</p>
            <p>But moreover <hi>De Marca</hi> in
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:62633:132"/>
the same place tells us, that the whole <hi>Clergy</hi> of <hi>France</hi> did most frequently in their <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods</hi> Petition their <hi>Kings,</hi> that they would <hi>Publish</hi> and <hi>Recieve</hi> the <hi>Trent</hi> Council (excepting those things which were repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican</hi> Church) and that they would never grant their <hi>Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> nor <hi>Publish</hi> or <hi>Recieve</hi> the <hi>Trent</hi> Council, though with that <hi>Exception.</hi> His words are, <hi>Totius Cleri Gallicani Conventus Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilij Tridentini promulgationem à Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus nostris supplicibus libellis postu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laverit, eâ lege ut ea Capita excipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, quae libertatibus Ecclesiae adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentur: Quorum desiderijs Principes, toto hoc negotio saepe in Consilium prudentissimorum relato, se accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare non potuerunt.</hi> From whence
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:62633:133"/>
it is evident, if that great <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> says true, that the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France</hi> would never <hi>recieve</hi> any of the <hi>Trent</hi> Council, no not that part of it, which was not against the <hi>Liberty</hi> of their <hi>Church,</hi> or their Kings <hi>Rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after all this, I must not forbear to observe how here it appears, that the Learned <hi>De Marca</hi> doth contradict himself. For in the same <hi>page</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne,</hi> viz. <hi>p.</hi> 133. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. he saith, that the <hi>Definitions</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> concerning <hi>Faith</hi> were admitted in <hi>France</hi> by a publick <hi>Edict, Anno</hi> 1579. (which must be in the 6th. <hi>year</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the 3<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>France</hi>) and yet he tells us in this same <hi>page</hi> and <hi>Columne,</hi> that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:62633:133"/>
the whole <hi>Clergy</hi> of <hi>France</hi> did most frequently <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition</hi> their <hi>Kings</hi> to <hi>Promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> and <hi>admit</hi> only that part of the <hi>Trent</hi> Council, which was not against the <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, yet their <hi>Kings</hi> would never <hi>admit</hi> it. If these words of his mean any thing, I think they must mean the <hi>Definitions</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> which <hi>De Marca</hi> saith were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieved by the <hi>Edict</hi> 1579. But if their Kings would never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any of it, though the whole Clergy did Petition them to do it, then was it not admitted by any Publick <hi>Edict</hi> in the <hi>year</hi> 1579.</p>
            <p>I remember the Learned <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> of the <hi>Nouvelles de la Republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que des letteres,</hi> for the <hi>Month</hi> of
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:62633:134"/>
               <hi>March</hi> 1685. there mentioning the <hi>Histoire critique du Vieux Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment par le P. Richard Simon Prêtre de la Congregation de l' Oratoire</hi> of the <hi>New Edition</hi> at <hi>Rotterdam</hi> that <hi>year,</hi> saith that <hi>that New Edition contains a Letter of a Protestant Doctor, who procured the</hi> 5<hi>th. Edition of that Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical History</hi>; and further quotes that <hi>Protestant</hi> Minister for giving an <hi>Answer</hi> to the ordinary <hi>Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, viz.</hi> that the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> hath been recieved in <hi>France,</hi> in what concerns <hi>Faith,</hi> but not in matters of <hi>Discipline</hi>; and he speaks of an <hi>Assembly</hi> of the <hi>Clergy</hi> held, which he saith, <hi>Deliberated how to present a Petition to the King, that that Council might be recieved as to what concerns Faith only, and that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever deliberation the Prelates made there upon, the Court would not grant
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:62633:134"/>
their Request. And if that Council</hi> (saith he) <hi>hath been received, let them produce us the publication of it, or any Act that shews us that it hath been truly received and publisht; for according to the Rules of Right, a Council cannot</hi> Faire Loy, <hi>if it hath not been published.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if any one were minded to speak Argumentatively, and shew that the <hi>French</hi> do not now receive the <hi>Trent</hi> Council, no not in <hi>rebus fidei,</hi> he might urge. 1. That the whole <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> of <hi>France</hi> in their <hi>Assembly, March</hi> 19. 1682. declared that a <hi>Council</hi> is above the <hi>Pope.</hi> 2. That he hath no Power in <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals</hi> in any Princes Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 3. That he hath no Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to <hi>Depose</hi> Princes. 4. Nor to <hi>Absolve</hi> Subjects from their
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:62633:135"/>
               <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance.</hi> 5. That he is not infallible. And though the <hi>Pope</hi> declared by his <hi>Bull</hi> Dated at <hi>Rome Apr.</hi> 11<hi>th.</hi> 1682. that those <hi>Acts</hi> of theirs were <hi>Null</hi> (the words of <hi>Improbamus, Rescindimus, Cassamus, &amp;c.</hi> being in the <hi>Bull</hi>) yet the <hi>French</hi> King had before in his <hi>Edict</hi> of <hi>March</hi> 23. 1682. Registred in <hi>Parliament,</hi> Ratified and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd them all. Nor is it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable, that these 5 Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, contradict many things in the <hi>Trent</hi> Council, which are setled in it as Doctrinal Points.</p>
            <p>And moreover 'tis obvious to any one to observe, that in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the <hi>French</hi> Clergy in the <hi>year</hi> 1685. they <hi>Cite</hi> their new <hi>Trent</hi> Creed <hi>(i. e.) some PART</hi>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:62633:135"/>
of it: For the last of it they cite, is <hi>p.</hi> 38. of that <hi>Book,</hi> and leave out the <hi>LAST part</hi> of that <hi>Creed,</hi> which is contained in these words, <hi>Caetera item omnia Sacris Canonibus &amp; aecumenicis Concilijs, ac praecipuè à Sacro-Sanctà Tridentinà Synodo tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dita, definita &amp; declarata, indubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanter recipio ac profiteor, simulque Contraria omnia atque haereses quascun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ab Ecclesiâ damnatas &amp; rejectas &amp; Anathematizatas, ego pariter rejicio, damno, &amp; Anathematizo. Hanc ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram Catholicam fidem, extrà quam nemo salvus esse potest, quam in prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sente sponte profiteor &amp; veraciter te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo, eandem integram usque ad extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum vitae Spiritum Constantissimè re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinere &amp; confiteri, atque ab illis quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum cura ad me in munere hoc specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, teneri, doceri &amp; praedicari quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum in me est curaturum. Ego idem N.
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:62633:136"/>
spondeo, voveo, juro,</hi> &amp;c. These are the words which the <hi>French</hi> Clergy leave out in their <hi>Book</hi> above mentioned, and they knew the Preservation of the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties</hi> of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, obliged them to such omission.</p>
            <p>For by this part of the <hi>Trent Creed,</hi> they are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and profess, <hi>Omnia à Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilio Tridentino tradita, definita, declarata,</hi> and so not matters of Doctrine and <hi>Definitions</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> only: And 'tis most plain, that the Council intended both matters of <hi>Discipline</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi> And in the aforesaid words of the <hi>Trent</hi> Creed, a firm Belief is required to be given, <hi>omnibus in Concilijs oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menicis traditis</hi>; and then a long <hi>farewel</hi> to all their <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:62633:136"/>
of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church would ensue, and their <hi>Sanctio Pragmatica,</hi> which is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Comprehension of them is Damned by <hi>Leo</hi> the 10th. <hi>approbante Concilio,</hi> in the General <hi>Lateran</hi> Council.</p>
            <p>It may be moreover said, that the words above mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that the <hi>French Clergy</hi> left out of their Book are a part <hi>Fidei Catholicae extrà quam non est salus</hi>: and therefore if the <hi>French</hi> do not receive (as it seems they do not) this part of the <hi>Trent</hi> Creed, then it may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well be doubted, whether they receiv'd the <hi>Definitions</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, as <hi>De Marca</hi> would have us believe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Trent</hi> Creed I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:62633:137"/>
to, is at the end of that Council in most of the <hi>Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of it; but in the <hi>Edition</hi> at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> which is the best, <hi>viz. Anno</hi> 1633, it is in the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Council. Ses.</hi> 24. <hi>p.</hi> 450, 451.</p>

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:62633:139"/>
was an Exile in <hi>France,</hi> in the time of the <hi>Vsurpation,</hi> and whose observation penetrated as far into the Constitution of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, as either <hi>F.

<q>We have seen here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore how, the <hi>French</hi> Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador in the Name of the King and Church of <hi>France,</hi> protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against it, and until this day, though they do not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it, but acquiesce, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void such disadvantages as must ensue thereupon, yet they never did admit it. Let no Man say that they rejected the Determinations thereof on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in point of Discipline, not of

            <p>Monsieur <hi>Iurieu</hi> in his <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical</hi> Reflections on Councils, and particularly on that of <hi>Trent,</hi> which were Translated into <hi>English,</hi> and Printed in the <hi>year</hi> 1684. Saith that <hi>the</hi> French <hi>Kings their Parliaments and Bishops dislike several things in the Decrees of the Council of</hi> Trent; and mentions as the <hi>Reasons</hi> why the <hi>Council of Trent</hi> is not <hi>received</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> these following. 1.
<q>That the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil hath done and suffered many things that suppose and confirm a Superiority of the Pope over Councils. 2. It
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:62633:140"/>
hath confirmed the Papal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments upon ordinary's by exemption of Chapters, and priviledges of Regulars, who are both withdrawn from Episcopal Jurisdiction. 3. That it hath not restored to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, certain Functions ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to their Office and taken from them, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than to execute them as delegates of the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> 4. That it hath infringed the priviledges of Bishops, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judged by their Metrapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan and Bishops of Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by permitting a removal of great Causes to <hi>Rome,</hi> and giving Power to the Pope, to Name Commissioners to Judge the Accused Bishop. 5. That it hath declared, that
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:62633:140"/>
neither Princes, Magistrates nor People, are to be consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Setling and placing of Bishops. 6. That it hath Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered Bishops, to proceed in their Jurisdictions by Civil pains, by Imprisonment, and by Seisures of the Temporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. 7. That it hath made Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops the Executors of all Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, for Pious uses. 8. That it hath given them a Superintendency over Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, Colledges, and Fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, with power of disposing their Goods, notwithstanding that these matters had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways managed by Lay Men. 9. That it hath ordained, that Bps. shall have the examining of all Notaries Royal and Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, with power to Deprive
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:62633:141"/>
or Suspend, notwithstanding any Opposition or Appeal. 10. That it hath given power to Bishops, with consent of two Members of their Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and of two of their Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, to take and retrench part of the Revenue of the Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals, and to take away feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal Tithes belonging to Lay-Men. 11. That it hath made Bishops the Masters of Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Piety, as Churches, Chappels and Hospitals, so as that those who have the Care and Government of them, are obliged to be accountable to the Bishops. 12. That in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming Ecclesiastical Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it hath wholy ascribed to the Pope and Spiritual Judges, all power of Judging
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:62633:141"/>
the Causes of Accused Bishops, as if Soveraign Princes had lost the right they had over their Subjects, as soon as they became Ecclesiasticks. 13. That it hath empower'd the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Judges Ecclesiastick, in Quality of Delegates of the Holy See, to enquire of the Right and Possession of Lay-Patronages; and to quash and annul them, if they were not of great necessity and well founded. 14. That in Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting Duels, it had declared, that such Emperor or Prince, as should shew favour to Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, should therefore be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated and Deprived of the Seignory of the place holding of the Church, where the Duel was fought. 15.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:62633:142"/>
that it hath permitted the Mendicant <hi>Fryars</hi> to possess Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveables. 16. That it hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained an Establishment of Judges it calls Apostoles in all Dioceses, with Power to Judge of Spiritual and Ecclesiastical Matters, in prejudice of the Ordinary. 17. That it hath declared, that Matrimonial Causes, are of the Churches Jurisdiction. 18. That it hath enjoyn'd Kings and Princes to leave Ecclesiasticks, the free and entire possession of the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction granted them by the Holy Canons, and General Councils, that is to say, usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by the Clergy over the Civil Power. These are the Principal Points Disputed in <hi>France</hi>: These that tend to the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:62633:142"/>
Diminution of the Authority and Priviledges of Bishops, to enlarge the Roman power, are Rejected by the Bishops: And those that would extend the power of Bishops to the Prejudice of the Civil Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity are Rejected by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments. Between both, this Council, as enacting contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Rights and Liberties of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was never at all received in <hi>France,</hi> so as to obtain the force of a Law.</q>
He then shews, that the <hi>Popes</hi> Superiority over <hi>Councils,</hi> is a <hi>point</hi> of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and was decided in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>: And yet that the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church <hi>believes</hi> the <hi>contrary.</hi>
               <q>I know it will be said (saith he) that the Council of
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:62633:143"/>
                  <hi>Trent</hi> hath not decided, that the Pope is Superior to Councils. Men may talk as they please; but things for all that, will continue as they are. It is true, that among the Decrees and Canons of the Council, there is none that saith in express Terms, that the Pope is Superior to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and can be judged by none: But the effect of such Decision is apparent in all the Acts, and through the whole Conduct of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</q>
And he afterward saith, that the <hi>Clause</hi> of <hi>proponentibus legatis,</hi> was a plain <hi>Decision</hi> of the Popes <hi>Superiority</hi> over the <hi>Council.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to these 18 <hi>Reasons</hi> of Mr. <hi>Iurieu,</hi> about the Recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:62633:143"/>
of the <hi>Trent</hi> Council in <hi>France</hi>; being neither practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nor practised; I might add, that, according to what my Lord Primate <hi>Bramhal</hi> observes in another place of that Book of his, I Cited before, <hi>the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience promised to the Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>as Successor to St.</hi> Peter <hi>and Vicar of Iesus Christ, pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to the</hi> Trent <hi>Council, may seem to quadrate but ill with the liberty of the</hi> Gallican <hi>Church, to set up a Patriarch.</hi> For in <hi>p.</hi> 194. of that <hi>Book,</hi> he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that <hi>in Cardinal</hi> Richelieu's <hi>Days it was well known, what Books were freely Printed in</hi> France, <hi>and publickly sold upon</hi> pont neuf <hi>of the lawfulness of Erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a new, or rather restoring an old proper Patriarchate in</hi> France, <hi>as
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:62633:144"/>
one of the liberties of the</hi> Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can <hi>Church</hi>: And thereupon saith, <hi>It was well for the</hi> Roman <hi>Court, that they became more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious to the</hi> French <hi>Affairs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if we consider how in the 22<hi>d. Session</hi> of the Council of <hi>Trent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chapter</hi> the 11<hi>th.</hi> all Kings and Emperors are <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematized,</hi> who hinder any <hi>Ecclesiasticks</hi> from the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any of their <hi>feudal</hi> Rights, or other profits; and that it might well be supposed, that the Course and Vicissitudes of time would put Roman Catholick Princes on somewhat of that Nature, and which so eminently influenced the <hi>French</hi> King in the <hi>Munster</hi> Treaty; none need wonder at the <hi>Trent</hi> Councils not being received in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:62633:144"/>There was a Book called <hi>a Review of the Council of</hi> Trent, written by a Learned Roman-Catholick, and Printed <hi>A.</hi> 1600. and <hi>Translated</hi> by Dr <hi>Langbain</hi> and Printed at <hi>Oxon</hi> 1638. The <hi>Author</hi> is believed by <hi>Rivet</hi> in his Answer to <hi>Coeffeteau,</hi> and by <hi>Langbain,</hi> to be <hi>William Ranclin</hi> Dr. <hi>of Laws, fiscal Advocate in the Court of Aydes at</hi> Oua in <hi>Henry</hi> the 4<hi>ths.</hi> time, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward <hi>Attorney General</hi> in the Soveraign Court of <hi>Aydes</hi> at <hi>Montpellier,</hi> In <hi>ch.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 11. of the Translated Book he tells us, <hi>that being at Court, he saw ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny earnest Suits Exhibited to the</hi> French <hi>King, in behalf of the Pope, for the receiving that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; and such as had been made to the preceding Kings; but which
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:62633:145"/>
they would never grant, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the publication of what they conceived so dangerous to Church and State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in <hi>ch.</hi> 2. he gives us se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Instances, which were made to the late Kings, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent. Charles</hi> the 9th. <hi>was moved by the Embassadors of Pope</hi> Pius <hi>the</hi> 4th, <hi>the Emperor and King of the</hi> Romans, <hi>the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>the Prince of</hi> Piemont, <hi>soon after the year</hi> 1563. <hi>to Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish that Council. The King said, he would have the Advice of his Lords: But it was Determined by them, that he should not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to their Requests. That in the year</hi> 1572. <hi>when Cardinal</hi> Alexandrino <hi>knew the Popes Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew came out of</hi> Spain <hi>into</hi>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:62633:145"/>
France, <hi>with Commission to rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the Suit to</hi> Henry the 3d. <hi>both the Pope and the Clergy ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to publish it; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was done. The Request was renewed by the Clergy at</hi> Blois, <hi>and especially by</hi> Peter Espinoc <hi>Archbishop of</hi> Lions, <hi>in the year</hi> 1576; <hi>but without any ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Request was renewed by the Assembly of</hi> France, <hi>Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at</hi> Melun <hi>in Iuly</hi> 1579. <hi>The Speaker was</hi> Arnalt <hi>Bishop of</hi> Bazas. Nicholas Angelier <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of</hi> Brien, <hi>made the like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to the same King,</hi> Oct. 3. 1579. <hi>and again</hi> July 17. 1582. Renald <hi>of</hi> Beaune, <hi>Arch-Bishop of</hi> Bourges, <hi>and Primate of</hi> Aquitaine, <hi>Delegate for the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, made the same Request at</hi>

Fountain-Bleau; <hi>but all in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the beginning of</hi> A. 1583. <hi>A</hi> Nuntio <hi>came from the Pope into</hi> France <hi>to</hi> Henry <hi>the</hi> 3d. <hi>but could not stir him from his purpose: and in a Letter to the King of</hi> Navarre Henry 4. <hi>who afterward Succeeded him, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests, that it was never in his thoughts to admit of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>November <hi>the</hi> 19th. 1585. <hi>the aforesaid Bishop</hi> Nicholas Angelier <hi>renews this Request ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry earnestly to the King; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Assault is made on him</hi> October 14. 1585. <hi>by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop and Earl of</hi> Nayan, <hi>who in his Speech is very Confident, that the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>was guided by the Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He adds, <hi>though it was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:62633:146"/>
yet several things in that Council, especially what concern'd the Clergy, were inserted in the Canons of some of their Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Councils held in</hi> France, <hi>at</hi> Rohan. 1581, <hi>at</hi> Bourges 1584. <hi>at</hi> Tours 1585. <hi>and at</hi> Aix <hi>in</hi> Provence <hi>the same year.</hi>

               <hi>One of the Kings Lieutenants General for the Administration of Iustice, in an Assembly of the States particularly,</hi> An. 1588. <hi>makes a Suit to the King to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish the Council; but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; Nay more, The King did not receive so much as those very Decrees of the Council, which were no way Repugnant to the</hi> Gallican <hi>Liberties. However, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing the Name of the Council, they Decreed the very same things at</hi> Blois, An. 1579.</p>

            <p>And I am glad that since the 2<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>March.</hi> 1679. so much occasion hath been given by the <hi>Popes</hi> Condemning the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets</hi> of the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> about the Doctrine of <hi>CALVMNY,</hi> and their <hi>Sicarious</hi> Principles, for the not charging them on the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>approved</hi> by it as formerly.

Nor do I charge on the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church or State, what I have mentioned out of <hi>Boerius,</hi> a <hi>President</hi> of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> there: If they hoped by the publication of their <hi>Book</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> to effect a <hi>Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Churches</hi> there, or the <hi>Translators</hi> of it any such thing by their Printing it here, much good may their Design do them: But it seems an untoward way of beginning a Reconciliation by <hi>giving</hi> the

               <hi>lie,</hi> or accusing the pretended Reform'd of <hi>Calumnies and Falsities.</hi> But the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Papist Represented and Misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> hath outdone the <hi>French</hi> Clergy in Civility of Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to Protestants, and by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring them only <hi>Misrepresenters</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet since both these <hi>Books</hi> do agree in <hi>Representing</hi> Roman-Catholicks as owning the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> I <hi>standing fast in the Liberty</hi> I have, not to be imposed on by those Doctrines, intermeddle not here with others liberty, to own any Religionary <hi>Tenets</hi> of the same.</p>

that your Information of the Temper of the Generality of them, might be what arrived not at my Knowledge, and that therefore you pronounced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as you have done.

            <p>From your having in that <hi>Discussion</hi> occasionally so much dilated on the <hi>Moral</hi> Offices of <hi>Loyalty</hi> to our Princes, without respect to their <hi>Religion,</hi> and

            <p>There is one <hi>noble</hi> Virtue of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Christians, that hath indeed by the <hi>Successful</hi> labours of the <hi>Divines</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> been lately much Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:62633:184"/>
in this Land; and that is, <hi>Loyalty</hi> to our <hi>Princes,</hi> and God be thanked that we have many thousands of the <hi>Layety</hi> of that <hi>Church</hi> who have been better instructed in that <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> virtue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then ever <hi>Bellarmine was</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as appears by his <hi>Quia dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant vires.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I wish that for the <hi>ease</hi> of his <hi>Majesties</hi> Cares and <hi>Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of his Government, all Mens <hi>Ideas</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> may grow both more <hi>refined</hi> and firm. And that according to your excellent <hi>quotation</hi> out of <hi>Seneca, Quanto latius officio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum patet quam juris Regula,</hi> all his Majesties Subjects may pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise the <hi>Primitive</hi> Obedience to the <hi>Height</hi> of all <hi>Moral</hi> Offices, &amp; not to think that their being
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:62633:185"/>
barely <hi>legales homines,</hi> in doing what the Law compells them to for his Service, is all the <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty</hi> or <hi>Obedience</hi> requisite.</p>
            <p>The <hi>obvious</hi> thought of <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> as well as <hi>Parents</hi> being <hi>Morally</hi> bound to be helpful to each other beyond what they are constrained to by the Law, may shew us the reasonableness of the extending our Obedience to our <hi>Political</hi> Father, to all the Noble heights of <hi>Virtue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I-am very well pleas'd with the <hi>passages</hi> in your <hi>Discourse,</hi> that brand <hi>Mercenary</hi> Loyalty in <hi>p.</hi> 274. and the <hi>I opeans</hi> you sing to the Crowns <hi>victories</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained over <hi>Mercenary</hi> loyalty. And here I cannot omit being so just to your self, as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that you have as
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:62633:185"/>
good a warrant, as any Subject of the Crown I know, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend <hi>Mercenary</hi> Loyalty; since on your modest Application to the late <hi>King</hi> upon the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of your friends, for a Compensation of your <hi>varicus</hi> Services done him almost ever since his <hi>Restoration,</hi> and the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inbursment</hi> of your <hi>expences</hi> in his Service, and on his <hi>Ministers</hi> by <hi>reference</hi> consulting my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about your <hi>Case,</hi> I found several thousands of pounds due to you on that account, and do Judge that you never since ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to his late <hi>Majesty,</hi> nor any of his <hi>Ministers</hi> about the same. But one instance more of your <hi>unmercenary</hi> Loyalty I shall not conceal, that I was assured of from a Lord in High Favour
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:62633:186"/>
with his late <hi>Majesty,</hi> Namely, that when in his late <hi>Majesties</hi> Reign, he knowing your Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to serve the King, did of his own accord offer to you his readiness to move his Majesty to afford you a fair <hi>Pension,</hi> you Over-Modestly requested his Lordship to move no such thing in your behalf, professing to his Lordship that it should be the business of your life, to promote all his Majesties Just Measures in what you could, without any expectation of other reward than what the pleasure of all Actions of Loyalty necessarily included in the doing of them. And to this too I might add, that in the time when the late <hi>Western</hi> Rebellion was most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, your having with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:62633:186"/>
Gentlemen appear'd to his Majesty, as ready at your own expence, to be then in Arms to serve the Crown at an Hours warning, was a further fair ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of your <hi>unmercenary</hi> Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty.</p>
            <p>And the truth is, that in the Present State of <hi>England,</hi> when it so much imports us to restore <hi>England</hi> to its Old <hi>Office</hi> of bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancing the World, <hi>Mercenary</hi> Loyalty would be now a kind of Monster In morality.</p>
            <p>It here falls in my way to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that you have in <hi>p.</hi> 156. and 157. very usefully shewn <hi>Mercenary</hi> Religion to be a thing both senseless and odious. And therefore tho you may seem the only person of the Church of <hi>Eng.</hi> who hath in print vary'd
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:62633:187"/>
from its Homilies or Articles since his <hi>Majesties</hi> Reign in any <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionary</hi> point: Yet as to your self, I have had reason to guess that you long ago in the <hi>late</hi> Kings Reign had some <hi>Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical</hi> Sentiments some what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from what I took for our Churches <hi>Articles,</hi> and that I speaking to you thereof, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd out of <hi>Bishop</hi> Bramhalls <hi>Iust Vindication of our Church,</hi> that <hi>our Articles are not penned with Anathemas, or Curses against all those even of our own, who do not receive them; but used only as an help or rule of unity among our selves.</hi>

            <p>Nor have I forgot how you once discoursed to me your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the <hi>Tenet,</hi> that <hi>the Souls of good Men, do not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately

of that in their Discourse; and that <hi>POPERY's</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolizing so much of their Discourse, had been one of its <hi>VSVRPATIONS,</hi> you intended to try to divert them from it, and make them pass <hi>ad au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres,</hi> by laying before them such various Matters of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, relating to their own Country and many places of Christendom, as might give them somewhat beside <hi>POPERY</hi> and <hi>PLOTS</hi> to think and speak of in Company;</q>
So I am much better pleased with your Performance of that your Curious Enterprize, and do think that your <hi>Book</hi>
               <pb n="346" facs="tcp:62633:196"/>
by containing in it so many <hi>MISCELLANEA,</hi> must <hi>eo nomine,</hi> prove highly use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to our <hi>English</hi> World in this Conjuncture.</p>
            <p>It here occurs to me to <hi>observe</hi> to you, that after an <hi>Erratum</hi> of the <hi>Press</hi> in <hi>Page</hi> 38. of your <hi>Discourse,</hi> Namely, where you referred to P. 325 in the <hi>Advocate of Conscience Liberty,</hi> instead of <hi>Page</hi> 225, you make the last <hi>Letter</hi> of <hi>D'Ossats</hi> to be from <hi>Rome An.</hi> 1596, and I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you happened to do so, by casting your Eye on the Old Date of the <hi>last</hi> Letter but <hi>one</hi> Printed in the <hi>Volume</hi> of his <hi>Letters</hi> in <hi>Folio</hi> of the <hi>Paris</hi> Edition, <hi>An.</hi> 1625. and
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:62633:196"/>
finding it to be <hi>An.</hi> 1596. But it came not into your Mind then, to observe that the <hi>last</hi> of his <hi>Letters</hi> as they are <hi>Ranged</hi> in <hi>Order,</hi> was the 199<hi>th.</hi> and in the <hi>End</hi> of <hi>Book</hi> 9<hi>th.</hi> and which was to <hi>Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy</hi> from <hi>Rome, March</hi> the 6<hi>th. An.</hi> 1604, and in which <hi>Year</hi> he dy'd, as you right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refer to his <hi>Epitaph</hi> to shew. But it seems after that last <hi>Letter</hi> in <hi>Book</hi> 9<hi>th.</hi> of the <hi>Paris</hi> Edition, the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisher</hi> saying that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered some others of his <hi>Letters,</hi> Prints them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out respect to the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>time</hi>; and there makes the <hi>Date</hi> of the <hi>last</hi> Letter save <hi>one</hi> in the <hi>Volume,</hi> to be in
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:62633:197"/>
the <hi>Year</hi> 1596. as you have there done. But however this <hi>Derogates</hi> not from the <hi>Iustice</hi> of your <hi>Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> in <hi>page</hi> 38. on the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Catholick</hi> English <hi>Priest,</hi> for making <hi>D' Ossat</hi> to have known the <hi>Gun-Powder</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <hi>Plot</hi> to be a <hi>Sham</hi> one, Eight <hi>Years</hi> before it was to be Executed. For the <hi>Letter</hi> of <hi>D' Ossat</hi> that that <hi>Priest</hi> alledged to <hi>prove</hi> what I now mentioned, was Dated as you justly say from <hi>Rome, March</hi> 29<hi>th. An.</hi> 1596, and he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read the <hi>Letter</hi> that can find any thing of the <hi>Gun-Powder</hi> Treason in it.</p>
            <p>I shall here take occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to make my <hi>Excuse</hi> to
