            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>I Had no Design to expose this Sermon to Publick Uiew and Censure in this Critical Age, and Climate; but being Preach'd in a Languishing Infirmity of Body, rendering my Voice not audible to the greatest part of a Venerable, ample Congregation; I have been sollicited to transmit it to the Press for Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Defailance of Eloquution in the Pulpit, that those Religious Advertisements which va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd in the Air, perish'd in their Birth in the Temple, may be retained, revived, in the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set, that they may, by the Divine compassionate Grace, conduce to promote a Heavenly Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation on Earth.</hi>

               <bibl>Luke 16. 9.</bibl>
               <q>I say unto you, make to your selves Friends of the Mammon of Unrighteousness; that when ye fail, they may receive you into Everlasting Habitations.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>MY Text is <hi>Verbum Diei,</hi> it is part of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel for this Day, it is the Cloze and the Lustre of a Parable, (the Style of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Eastern Rhetorick for Instruction.) The Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Parable holds resemblance with that of the Temple of Jerusalem; for the Porch, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and the inward Court.</p>
            <p>The Introduction is not the Porch of <hi>Solomon,</hi> but of <hi>Christ,</hi> he said to his Disciples in <hi>Ver.</hi> 1. This Gate of the Temple may truly venerably be called <hi>Beautiful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The three Parables, recorded in the immediate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Chapter, of the lost Sheep, the lost Groat, and the prodigal Son, were moulded for the Scribes and Pharisees, to lance their Bosom Imposthume of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Pride and Arrogance, who, in being imaginary Saints, became real Miscreants. The Parable of the unjust Steward recited in this Chapter is calculated for another Meridian, not for the Judaical Synagogue, but the Church of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:43028:4"/>
An Advertisement for his select Train, his signal Disciples, who like Eagles soaring aloft did cast a glance on the Prey below; whilst their Professions were raised to heavenly Enjoyments, their Affections were somewhat deprest by Earthly: Though pure Bullion from the Ore, yet not yet entirely refined from the Furnace, not without an Alloy of Dross, a Mixture of Rubbish. To cure this spreading Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Christ enwraps his Dose in a Parable.</p>
            <p>To unveil the Narration of the Parable; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators understand the certain Rich man in the first Verse to be Christ, <hi>(verus</hi> a true, though not <hi>merus Homo</hi> a mere man, in St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) the sole Proprietary, the Lord paramount of all the Treasures of the Earth, and of Heaven, also that illustrious City resplendent with Streets of Gold and Gates of Pearls. <hi>Theophylact</hi> and <hi>Euthymius</hi> expound the Steward in the first Verse to be a wealthy perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, improved in Fortune, yet not enfranchised, not discharged from his dependance, not so properly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed as intrusted, impeacht he is for his Talent mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>employed; it is a Bill of Wast, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in <hi>Ver.</hi> 1. scattering, imbezeling his Masters Goods. The Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation is recited, but the Accusers concealed: Satan who is a smooth Tempter to suggest, to solicit Guilt, becomes a sharp Orator to charge, to aggravate it.</p>
            <p>Every humane Offence calls for, in some cases, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunes, clamors for the divine Judgment. The Offenders perhaps last, yet not his least Accuser is his own Conscience, this secret Whisper is more terrifying than a Clap of Thunder.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:43028:4"/>
The Accusations are varied, yet Christ arraigns, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amins, before he dooms: not like <hi>Augustus,</hi> precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Sentence without the Traverse, without the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Indictment, against the Inhabitants of <hi>Perusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um; Moriendum,</hi> they must die. It suits not with the Track, the Custom of the Israelitish, not of the Roman Pagan Justice, to condemn any <note place="margin">Joh. 7. 51. Acts 25. 16.</note> one unheard. Christ affords the Person charged in this Parable Liberty to assay to vindicate himself in <hi>Ver.</hi> 2. <hi>Give an account of thy Stewardship,</hi> of thy Fortune, of thy Office, thy Knowledge, thy Talent whatsoever; as some run varieties of Descants on this Note.</p>
            <p>Every Stroke of Affliction, every lash of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is a kind of Reckoning betwixt God and Man for each of these: God righteously deprives men of those Talents, those Enjoyments, which they unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously manage. It is a disconsolate Sentence pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in <hi>Ver.</hi> 2. <hi>Thou canst be no longer Steward.</hi> Some determine this to be executed at the Hour of Death.</p>
            <p>Before the fatal time of Dissolution, God may reduce the wealthiest Personages to Penury, the greatest Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates to Impotency, the most subtle politick Statists, the most accurate Artists, to Folly, to Infatuation <hi>Alber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> the great was bereaved of his great Stock of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge three years before he died. The Steward sentenced in the Parable was at first dampt and chil'd, staggered in Perplexity of Mind; he was too nice and delicate to be a Labourer, (dig he could not) he was too haughty and arrogant to be a Petitioner, (to beg he was ashamed) however he is not long destitute of an unholy Clue
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43028:5"/>
to wind him out of this Labyrinth. He lays an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation on his Masters Debtors by his own Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, ingratiates and depraves himself, contrives his Iniquity to be his Support; and yet the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the unjust Steward. It sounds a Riddle, that he whose Injustice was his Design, his Artifice, that he who was injuriously bountiful, dishonestly liberal, should be extolled by that Master whom he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded.</p>
            <p>To dispel this Cloud; The Lord commended the Subtilty, not the Integrity of this false Steward, his Wit not his Grace. <hi>For the Children of this World, are in their Generation, wiser than the Children of Light. Ver.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>It is not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> more wise, but <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> more wily, more crafty, serpentine, (the Serpent devoured the Dove.) Wisdom, not only in the Judgment of S. <hi>Austin,</hi> but of <hi>Aristotle</hi> also, is the Knowledge of divine Perfections; Philosophers decipher it to be spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative, the Fathers state it to be active. It is <hi>Sapien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, quasi sapida scientia,</hi> saith <hi>Gerson,</hi> Wisdom is a Savo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Science, not contemplative but affective, not seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Brain, but in the Heart, which is best dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd by the Pulse of the Hand.</p>
            <p>Prudence is of a lower Size, Cunning is of a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser Metal, less refined and sublimated. They who are addicted, devoted to secular Interests, may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge a Preheminence in this Faculty, they are wiser in their kind, <hi>in genere suo,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> renders it, more exact Intelligencers in their Orb: But it is an excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick Orb; more expert in their Way, but it is a dark

a crooked Way; better Sophisters, smoother Parasites to set off corrupt Actions, like tainted Ware with fair Colours, with false Varnishes. They are wiser for an Age, not for Eternity; it is not <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, in their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as we render it, but <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>The Minions of the Earth, the Sages of the World, are more circumspect, diligent to preserve, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance their Estates, than the Candidates for Heaven, than the Disciples of the Sanctuary are to improve their Virtues, to save their Souls. Least we split on this Rock, Christ himself becomes our Pilot to steer our Course in a right Channel to a Port of Bliss. <hi>Make to your selves Friends of the Mammon of Unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting Habitations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Text brancheth it self into a Precept, and a Reward: The Precept describes, regulates our Duty: <hi>Make to your selves Friends of the Mammon of Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.</hi> The Reward animates, crowns our perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance: <hi>That they may receive you into everlasting Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi> The former Part is an Introduction to the latter, for the Disciples of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as the Temple of Virtue was a Passage to that of Honour, for the Votaries of <hi>Rome.</hi> In the first General I shall by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Assistance offer at a distinct view of the Engine to be employed. <hi>The Mammon of Unrighteousness;</hi> and of the Employment it self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:43028:6"/>
To make your selves Friends of it; this transforms a Poyson to a Medicine, it extracts an Antidote out of a Viper, a Viper that stings an unsanctified Soul, envenoms it to Death. My first Task is the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Engine it self, set out in a black Hue, in a branded Character: <hi>The Mammon of Unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Divines Ancient and Modern have varieties of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures touching the name and nature, the Phrase and Importance of Mammon. I shall not spend time nicely and critically to discuss whether Mammon be of an Hebrew, Chaldaick or Syriack Extraction; most probably it is of a Syriack Stock, being not extant in the Hebrew Original, or in the Chaldee Paraphrase of the old Testament. <hi>Tertullian</hi> interprets <hi>Mammon</hi> Mony, St. <hi>Austin</hi> Gain, <hi>Hesychius</hi> Treasures, the margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal English Illustration renders it Riches.

than condemning the Rich. <hi>Tertullian</hi> determines it to be woven with a mingled Thread of Advice and Menace. Not to hover too long in Generalities. It is the Mammon of Unrighteousness, because too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, injuriously, unconscionably atchieved, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graciously, uncharitably detained, or else riotously, profusely squander'd, as if Men were at variance with their Wealth, and would not dispose, but discard it. Thus, without the Divine restraining Grace, we are too prone to bane, to curse our selves, with what God doth otherwise bless and prosper us. It is the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist</hi>'s dismal Imprecation; <hi>Let that which should have been for their Wealth, be to them an occasion of falling.</hi> This lapse is a Precipice, an occasion of Perdition. Not unlike to <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> who did contrive Cords of Gold and Silver to be strangled with, who laid up Poyson in Boxes of precious Stones to be destroy'd with.</p>
            <p>The indirect Toils, and Mazes of Designs of the Sages of this World, are but elaborate solemn Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to Mammon, the Idol Paramount, like <hi>Bel</hi> among the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> whereto all the rest vail and do homage.</p>
            <p>It is related, when a timorous Patient suspected a Medicine of <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> as if it had a Grain of Magick for an Ingredient, <hi>Paracelsus</hi> resented it with Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, What mattereth thee if thou be recovered, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be by God or the Devil?

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43028:8"/>
taint and transform the most wholsom Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision to Crudities, Diseases. The Unrighteousness consists not in enlarged Treasures and Incomes, but in unsatisfied Desires, in unsanctified Pursuits and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Wealth, in its own Nature and Constitution, is not virtuous or vicious, not morally good or evil, which is, <hi>bona bonis, mala malis,</hi> (saith St. <hi>Austin) Good to good Men, bad to evil:</hi> Like <hi>Rufus</hi>'s Shield, that had God on one side, Satan on the other, with this Motto of Inscription, <hi>Prepare for both.</hi> It is like the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> destructive to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> preservative to the <hi>Israelites.</hi>

            <p>Riches, as Viands, turn to that Humour which is most predominant; to one they nourish Piety, Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; to another, Prodigality, Profaness; to some, the supports of Riots, and Debauches; to others, of Alms and Graces. They are the Wings of Salvation, and the Plummets of Perdition; they are the Rounds of the Ladder, whereby some ascend to Heaven, others descend to Hell; they are the Oyl to kindle the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flame of Satan's Furnace, and the Oyl also to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the shining Lamp of the Sanctuary. Wealth, like a Scorpion, affords a Cure for its own Sting; it is by making you Friends of it: which conducts me to the Management of the Mammon of Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</p>
            <p>The two Expedients of this Sacred Friendship in my Text, the Flames not of the Hearth, but the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, to refine the dross, to purifie the pollution of Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, are Equity and Charity: Equity, like <hi>Janus,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:43028:9"/>
hath a double Aspect, it looks forward for Possession, and backward for Restitution; the one is a Branch of Innocence, the other of Repentance; the one prevents the Unrighteousness of Mammon, the other redresses it. It is with Equity, as with Physick; the Medicine which secures from a Malady, is more precious than that which heals it. That Justice which declines an Injury, challengeth a Preheminence of regard.</p>
            <p>The Equity of Possession is derived from just, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Owners, by justifiable, lawful means; by Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by Gift, by Succession, Inheritance, by Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, by Contract, which spreads it self to many Branches; these are the ordinary, equitable, warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Conveyances.</p>
            <p>To omit the Extraordinary; by right of Occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (the Tenure of a first Seizure) the Booty of a War rightly empowered, and uprightly managed, as also a judicial Forfeiture. The <hi>Israelites</hi> special Coin had the Impression of a Lamb.

The Giants in the Sixth Chapter of <hi>Gen.</hi> are by some expounded to be Grandees, not for Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but Power, exerted by Rapine, by vast dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Extortion. <gap reason="foreign">

When the Oppressed are smaller Morsels in the wider Jaws of the Oppressor, <hi>Eating up the People like Bread,</hi> in the <hi>Psalmist</hi>'s Phrase, <hi>Psal.</hi> 14. 4. It is St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Observation, that to eat like Bread, denotes a Constancy of Repast; other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision we vary, but to eat like Bread imports not to be rarely feasted, but continually fed; not banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but dieted with Iniquities. <hi>Manducant in terris,</hi> saith St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> They eat, they devour in Earth what they digest in Hell. Are not the Contracts of many Tenants and Debtors more pinching, galling than the Manacles of Prisoners? whose state of Vassalage is a Task and a Toil, a Penance and a Torture, a Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Death and a Dying Life; as <hi>Calphurnius</hi> was treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Tiberius;</hi> not so much ingratiated as to have their Misery expédited. It is a Work of Darkness, written with the Sun-Beams, yet hath gained the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of Prudence, of Master-piece of Wit, (tho' sulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, blackned with Vice.)</p>
            <p>Let me here inoffensively express it to this Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Assembly, being like a weight of Lead upon my Conscience till I disburthen it.</p>
            <p>It becomes us to treat Tenants and Debtors, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally such as are Industrious and Frugal, with such Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty 
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43028:10"/>
and Candor, as would be acceptable to our selves, were we reduced to the same Exigencies: We know not how suddenly, how strangely the Scenes of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune may be shifted. Riches, whilst they appear fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by irreversible Conveyances and Entails, yet fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently prove really winged to fly away in the height of imaginary Plenty and Security. It is according to the <hi>Syriack</hi> Translation of my Text, <hi>The Mammon of Deceitfulness.</hi> It will quit, desert us, or we must quit, desert it. Men may enhance their Estates and their Crimes, they may rack their Revenues and their Consciences, making the Necessities of others to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster fuel to their Superfluities, to maintain their Pomps, their Gayeties, the Excesses of their Riots, Debauches, the Impurities of their Dalliances, not only by the Sweats of their Brows, but the Groans of the Souls of others, to frolick it by their Anxiety, to surfeit it by their Famine, <hi>ut sentiant se mori,</hi> in <hi>Caligula</hi>'s Doom, That they languish before they perish.</p>
            <p>If in these, or any other Instances, the Equity of Possession be neglected, violated, it ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, expiated with that of Restitution. There are two Sisters, like <hi>Rachel</hi> and <hi>Leah:</hi> The one, like <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi> hath the more amiable Feature, the first Love of every true <hi>Israelite:</hi> The other, like <hi>Leah,</hi> is blear-ey'd, blemished, by wrong presuppos'd; it hath unhappily the Fate of <hi>Leah,</hi> to be too little affected or regarded; yet every Son of <hi>Jacob,</hi> who is bereaved of <hi>Rachel,</hi> the Equity of Possession, he ought to espouse <hi>Leah,</hi> to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Equity of Restitution. It is the Dictate, not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43028:10"/>
only of Christian Theological, but of Heathen Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Righteousness; the Civil as well as Canon Law enjoyns it. The Constitutions of all Nations not taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Lees of Barbarism exact it. To deny the Necessity of it is not Heresie, but Phrensie, saith <hi>Soto.</hi> Before the Law, it was the Injunction of <hi>Jacob,</hi> tho he had a specious Plea to evade it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 43. 12. <hi>Carry back the money that was brought in the mouth of the sack.</hi> Under the <hi>Mosaical Law,</hi> the Equity of Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution was professed by <hi>Samuel,</hi> as the Vindication of his Justice, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 13, 14. Prescribed by <hi>Nehemiah</hi> with a solemn Admonition, a sharp Execration, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> clusters it with the choicest Fruits of a spiritual, effectual, remorse of Conscience, <hi>Chap.</hi> 33. <hi>v.</hi> 15. Without this signal Certificate, Repentance, <hi>Non agitur sed fingitur,</hi> saith St. <hi>Austin,</hi> is not acted, but counterfeited. Under the Gospel, they who will not directly, uprightly, restore what they indirectly, injuriously attain, do not only deviate, swerve from the commendable Practice of <hi>Zacheus, (Luke</hi> 19. 8. <hi>I restore four-fold)</hi> but come short of <hi>Judas</hi>'s Religion, who came short of Salvation, that <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>It is an infallible Maxim in the Canon Law, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from St. <hi>Austin, Non remittitur peccatum nisi resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuatur ablatum,</hi> The Trespass is not remitted unless the Damage be restored. Wherein the Proportion, the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43028:11"/>
sure, is not the least difficulty in the Sentiments of Casuists; for the determining whereof, I shall distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the Penitential and Penal part of Restitution: The Penitential part is fixed, limited, adequate to the Offence, to the Detriment sustain'd: The Penal part is to be varied, enlarged, according to the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, Consequences; to wit, in due consideration of Cessation of Gain, and Emergencies of Loss; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in every Man's Conscience is a Judge to determine where the Law doth not, where it is defective, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutive.</p>
            <p>Among the <hi>Israelites</hi> there were several gradual Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations; a two-fold, a four-fold, a seven-fold Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. The Obligation of this Duty of Restitution extends further than the Actors themselves; even to the Inheritors, the Executors, that reap the Fruits. St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom</hi> is too candid, indulgent, to acquit, to discharge the Heirs of Oppressors. The most Conscientious Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suists exempt, disengage them from transient, vanishing Acts of Injustice, which escape their Discoveries; but not from such as are knowingly, lineally perpetual, that pass from Generation to Generation in the Incomes, Commodities.</p>
            <p>There is a Tincture of Injustice, as in compassing, purloining another's Interest, so in enjoying, withhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. It is the same crime, though not the same degree of Guilt. In the nice Discussion of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the one formally consists in the Punctilio, the Mode, the manner of Acquisition; the other materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally consists in reference to the advantage, whether ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, 
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43028:11"/>
or continued. Two grand impediments are started by Satans Sophistry, set out in a multiplying Glass, panick terrors to divert, to scare us from the requisite Practice of Restitution; to wit, the double train of Penury, and Infamy, the Loss and Shame that accrue from it: As for the damage alledged, it is the Tempters Subterfuge in disguise, it is less incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to impair thy Fortune, than to wound thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and to forfeit thy Soul; it is our Saviours staggering, unanswerable Interrogatory; <hi>what shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole World and lose his own Soul? Mark</hi> 8. 36.</p>
            <p>It is an unprofitable, and, in the end, an execrable State, that bottoms in sin; it is a depraved, accursed Possession in Earth, that lays its Foundation in Hell. But thou hopest, (presumest rather) that thy exercise of Repentance, thy Sorrow for sin will commute, will countervail for the defect of Restitution; so it may, by divine Goodness, in case of necessity, disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility for discharging of it. In that only the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy heart may be accepted, for Satisfaction of thy Hand; but where there are Sinews for real per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, the most formal Expresses of grief are meer hypocritical Varnishes of repentance. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession thereof, is but a Collusion, a Mockery, a Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Duty.</p>
            <q>—Stat magni nominis umbra.</q>
            <p>As for the second Scruple of Shame, to deterr us from the Justice of Restitution, it is a Shame for to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43028:12"/>
recite it; there is no deformity, no blemish in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of any virtue. <hi>Zacheus</hi> his Restitution was not his Brand, but his Renown, not his Stain but his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament; it was the robe of a sacred Convert, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume of a penitent Publican, the Fragrancy of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Equity for all succeeding ages. When a lascivious Youngster slinking out of an unreputable House started back, being espied by <hi>Diogenes,</hi> the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher advertised him, that his recess, his withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thence, need not put him to the Blush or Damp; but his entrance thither.</p>
            <p>Restitution doth not breed an Ulcer, but cure it. If it be objected, that it doth light a Torch to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest the festered Sore, which before was obscured, concealed: I answer this Discovery is the Lustre of Repentance, the Honour, the Trophy of it; at the worst it is but the Scar of a healed wound, after the Victory of a Battel; however if it be interpreted an Infamy, it is in the Gloss, the Censure of depraved men, suggested by damned Spirits, it is a Dignity in the estimate of the blessed Saints and Angels. <hi>Phocion</hi> apprehended the Elogy, the Praise of a vile Person, a lewd Caitiff, to be a Reproach, a Scandal.</p>
            <p>To dismiss this vain Cavil; a little Ingenuity, the least tincture of Prudence will divert, will realy conduce to steer aloof from the grand imaginary rock of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. The equity of Restitution may be so covertly discharged, that neither the Injury be revealed, nor the Party who acted it.</p>

But I forbear to dilate this Meditation, lest I seem to forget my self, and not to consider the Uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Age wherein we live. Our Judgments herein need not so much to be informed in the state of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, as our Affections to be warmed, to be inflam'd for the discharge of the Duty. There is no Duty of Religion more indispensably injoyn'd, none more abundantly encourag'd; and yet none more familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disregarded, more unexcusably spurn'd at. Most Men are herein not only practical but speculative In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, accounting Charity the Flux of Prodigality, the Product not of Religion but Indiscretion. They who are not Scepticks to dispute, to boggle at this Duty, who are not a sort of Atheists to reject the Precept, to deride the Performance; yet become Criticks to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the Iniquities of others, when they should be Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners to relieve their Pressure. Let us not be more Inquisitive than Compassionate, to sharpen our Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives against Mens Offences, which have procured their Miseries, rather than to enlarge our Bowels to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Miseries which invite our Supplies.</p>
            <p>It is God's part to Doom, ours to Succour. Indeed some are to be selected, preferred in their Calamities, such as are more sanctified, nearest related, most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated; yet none to be absolutely waved, but such as are Vagrants, Loyterers, whose Debility, Exigency in their Estates, may be repaired by the Vigour, Strength of their Limbs; to endear, to engage these to be our Friends by our Alms, were to be their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries 
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43028:14"/>
and our own. The Vinegar of Justice to such, is a better Restorative than the Oyl of Mercy; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may be rescued from their Necessities, and reclaimed from their Vices: That our Streets be not defamed by such Pests, that an Eminent City be not dishonoured by such Obloquies, Scandals; I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend, not only the Ancient pattern of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to your Imitation, but also the Modern of <hi>Paris,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in for many years, not only the scandalous Beggery of particular Persons hath been prevented, but the Publick Revenues have been promoted. The Apostle obstructs, blocks up the Effluxes of our Charity only to such, whose Indigence proceeds from a voluntary omission of Diligence. <hi>He that will not Labour, let him not Eat,</hi> 2 Thes. 3. 10. As for others, if we debar our Charity, we forfeit our Christianity.</p>
            <p>How rationally (as we presume) do we Object? May I not dispose of my own Inheritance, or my own Purchase, as my own genius shall prompt me? Must I expose my self contracted, and multiplied; the Consort of my Bosom, the Issue of my Loins to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Incumbrances, and Exigences, to supply the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of others? Shall I invite, attract Distress in the Lees of my declining Age, by an Imprudence of Bounty in the Flower, the Vigour of my Days? These specious Pretences are but fallacious Arguments, like our first Parents Fig-Leaves, to cover our Spiritual Nakedness, false Varnishes to beautifie carnal Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness. Let us not mistake our Tenure, it is not
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43028:14"/>
Primitive, but Derivative in our Fortunes. Our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest is a Deputation, a Stewardship in the genuine scope of this Parable. We are not Proprietaries, but Usufructuaries of Riches. These Talents are to be managed according to the Rule, the Dictate of God's Sacred Word, not according to the bent, the swinge of our own corrupt Hearts. God might have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted an equal Proportion of Enjoyments of this World to all sorts of Men, to be all levelled; but then (in the Observation of St. <hi>Basil</hi> the Great) there had been wanting a Test, for the Munificence, the Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Rich, and for the Patience, the Humility of the Poor. Christ hath ordained some to be Wealthy, to exercise their Fidelity, to discharge the part of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners, to be Treasurers for the Poor, nay, for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who sues for Succours in his distressed Members; and interprets Neglects of these, as Indignities against himself. <hi>In that you did it not to the least of these, you did it not to me,</hi> Mat. 25. 45. <hi>Quis ad tonitru hoc non expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vescit?</hi> (saith St. <hi>Austin) Who is not scar'd with this Thunder?</hi> They who shrink not, dread not to prevent, to decline this Doom, shall droop, shall sink to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain it. The Rich Man in the Gospel, <hi>(Luke</hi> 16.) was not condemned because he was unjust, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was unmerciful, not because he oppress'd <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> but because he relieved him not. A numerous Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue is no plea at God's Bar to vindicate a covetous Heart, or a tenacious Hand. A plentiful Progeny, is a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Topick, (at least it ought to be a perswasive
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43028:15"/>
Argument) to excite us to obtain, I had almost said (with due Reverence) to oblige Christ to be the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of our Children, unless we would surrender them to the Tuition of the Tempter, rather than the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. He, who is uncharitable upon the account of his Family, his Posterity, offends doubly in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of St. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> First, In that he doth not provide for his Children the Protection of the Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, preparatory for the time when they are to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved of the Earthly. Secondly, In that he does not discipline them in Exemplary Piety, to prefer God before Mammon. Willing or unwilling thou must surrender thy Treasures, thy Incomes, to the Divine over-ruling Providence. Lastly, Charity is inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately objected to be the rise of Penury.</p>
            <p>I shall not press St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s florid Argument in chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scene; <hi>Pauperior seculo opulentior Deo;</hi> Whilst more empoverisht to the World, thou wilt be more enricht to God. Not to recede out of the same Orb, not to swerve from the same Station: There is no Virtue more animated with assurance of Temporal Prosperity. The <hi>Italian</hi> Vulgar Phrase of Begging is Charm of Rhetorick; <hi>Faite a voi bene,</hi> Do well to your selves. Thy Alms in the Bowels of the Poor, are like Grains of Corn in the Bowels of the Earth; they seem to putrifie, to perish, but they come up with a specious Advantage. <hi>There is who scattereth, and yet encreaseth,</hi> Prov. 11. 24. who Thrives by Diminution, Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies by Substraction; a Contradiction in Arithmetick, but a Perfection in Grace.</p>

Such was the Primitive St. <hi>John,</hi> called, <hi>Eleemosunary.</hi> The Estate of a Charitable Person is like the Widows Cruise of Oyl, communicated, and not diminished, imparted, and not impaired; nay, improved. No Duty doth more vindicate us from Hypocrisie. It was the disconsolate Remark of St. <hi>Basil</hi> the Great, that he observed many zealous Professors his Contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Eminent for Devotion, for Mortification, for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, Chastity, and other Moral Endowments; and yet Tenacious, Uncharitable; which, like a venemous blast, tainted all the Religious Performances. I wish it were a Scandal to revive, to apply this mournful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment to the Age wherein we live. By our melting Bowels, our stretcht out Hands in Charitable Supplies, to make us Friends with the <hi>Mammon of Unrighteousness,</hi> is not an Evangelical Counsel, but Precept; not Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to be embraced, caressed; or waved, rejected, as a Serene, Candid, or Morose sour Humour shall bear sway.

            <p>There is an Obligation of Equity riveted in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity it self.

It is the Phrase, the Eloquence, the Charm of a <hi>Jewish</hi> Petitioner in his Exigency; give me the Precept.

            <p>The <hi>Jewish</hi> Doctors assert, that the Royal Prophet <hi>David</hi> gave Alms every day; it was his constant Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidian Practice, but more especially as preparatory to his public Solemn Devotion, when he resorted to the Synagogue, darting out this Ejaculation; <hi>I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thy Face in Righteousness,</hi> Psal. 17. 15.

Christ himself sets out the diffusive, operative Transcendency of this Virtue: <hi>Give alms of what things you have, and all things shall be clean. Luke.</hi> 11. 41. this is no Elegancy of an Irony, no smart Sarcasm, no taunting Scoff, as some expound it; but a sacred Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, taking off the Pharisees from a superstitious vain their Platters, to a truly religious Charity, to purifie their Hearts and their Hands also.

Whereas in a general Consideration, parabolical Scripture is not argumentative; in a special Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, this Gloss corrupts the Text, not only eclipses the Lustre and unsinews the Force of it; but renders

it a contradiction of Collusion, transforms an amiable Lure to invite, to attract to a dreadful Topick a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasive Argument, to avert, to deter; whereby a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward degenerates into Punishment. Neither the Phrase nor the Importance of the Text admits any degree of consistence with the Notion of Purgatory.

            <p>Not to insist on the controversial disquisition, I shall prosecute the practical; wherein who the Friends are to bestead us is an apposite inquiry.

Some Divines ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound these Friends to be the sacred blessed Trinity. A charitable Man is ingratiated, indeared to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: <hi>Abraham,</hi> whose Charity was as conspicuous as his Faith, was honoured to be entitled <hi>the Friend of God: Isaiah</hi> 41. 8. not only advanced, dignified in his Court, but embraced and embosomed in his Closet.

            <p>To sum up what I have enlarged, to close with every Soul in this venerable Assembly with an appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory Meditation. I have dissected my Text to a Precept and a Reward, resembling the Incense Altar and the Mercy Seat of the Tabernacle: In the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, I have viewed the Engine to be employed, and the Employment it self; the Engine being the <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of Unrighteousness,</hi> not to brand ample Treasures or Incomes, but ungracious practices in atchieving or managing them: <hi>Mammon</hi> being like the Chymicks <hi>Mercury,</hi> as it is differently tempered, either medicinal to heal, to help, or fatal to corrupt, to bane; fatal it is when criminal, darting its Taint not only to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise, but to Judicature, to Religion. Neither the Tribunal nor the Temple is a Sanctuary for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Exemption from this Pest; it wrought, vitiated <hi>Balaam</hi> to be a false Prophet, <hi>Judas</hi> to be a false Apostle, and <hi>Felix</hi> to be a corrupt Judge.</p>
            <p>I have discussed the managing the Engine, <hi>the Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of Unrighteousness,</hi> by two effectual expedients of the purest Friendship; by Equity and Charity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Supporters of Riches, as <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> were
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43028:19"/>
of the Hands of Moses. I have distinguished, sorted out a double Equity, of Possession and Restitution, the one being preservative of Right, the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensative of Wrong. Both are to be abetted, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decked, embellisht by Charity of Compassion, distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution: thereby to endear blessed Angels, whilst we oblige distressed men, thereby to be ranked as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peers in being befriended by those glorious Spirits; <hi>Amicitia pares vel accipit vel facit,</hi> Friendship either finds or makes Equals. To cajole, even to conjure so amicable a Duty, I have conducted your attention from the Precept to the Reward; wherein I have observed the Substance and the Circumstance of it; the Substance of it importing a Translation from the transitory accommodation of an Inn, to the first Station of a Dwelling, of everlasting Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations, to exchange a Tabernacle for a Temple; a Temple for Stability and Sanctity founded and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated by God himself. Those indigent Persons that are relieved by us, become our Factors to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate for us, to fix our Bank in Heaven; to take up our Treasure by a Bill of Exchange in another World; they are our Harbingers that we may be furnished with Heavenly Mansions, when we are to be bereaved of Earthly.</p>
            <p>I have pointed out the remarkable Circumstance of this incomparable Bliss; when it fails, to wit, <hi>Mammon,</hi> being like a Strumpet that shifts her Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, her Favorites: When our Souls are upon the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43028:19"/>
Wing of flight from our Bodies, in extremities of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonies, resigning them to be Inmates with Worms, to be putrified together, when there will remain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to him who unrighteously manages the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of <hi>Mammon;</hi> but a dismal accompt to enflame his reckoning with a corrosive Remorse of conscience, not like the Serpent that twined about the Head of <hi>Cleomenes</hi> when he died, but this Snake will wind it self about the Soul, to pierce it with anguish and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; No Friendship then either will or can bestead us, but this in my Text. Prosperity is a Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone to attract Friendship; but Misery is a Rock to split it. It was <hi>Socrates</hi>'s experimental complaint in Adversity; <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> there is no Friend, none in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed extant in the lowest Ebb, none indeed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> but of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> only.</p>
            <p>My Text sets the Life the Lustre of Friendship, in the Umbrage of Death, by the poor extended to the rich. <hi>Damascene</hi> vails this truth in an Apologue of a wealthy Person who owned three Friends; two whereof endeared as his Soul, nay more tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treated in their distinct concerns, more sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tously regarded; the third least estimated, yet not quite rejected: Whereas being summoned to appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance before a dreadful Judge, he made his Addresses to his several Friends: His first Friend affords him the Formality of some Accoutrements at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; to wit, insignificant for Solace or Advantage; his second Friend ceremoniously accompanies him to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43028:20"/>
the first Stage; his third inseparably adheres to him to the end of his Journey, vigorously assists him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the dreadful Tribunal.</p>
            <p>To withdraw the Curtain of the Apologue to a wealthy Person, as <hi>Nathan did to David,</hi> thou art the man thus befriended, <hi>(vetus Fabula per novam Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strionem;</hi> in the Comedians Phrase.) Thy first Friend is the World, this affords, at thy recess from it, a Winding-Sheet, a Coffin, a Hearse-Cloth; Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments specious as to the sight of others, not in any degree commodious to thy self. Thy second Friend is the Consort of thy Bed, the Mate of thy Bosom, or thy Issue which attends thy Hearse to the first Stage of thy Corps, the Grave; (if the Punctilio of State, or retired disguise of Mourning will vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe it) however this Friend takes there a final adieu, the Funeral Solemnity being celebrated, accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. Thy third Friend is the despicable, miserable Person, whom thou relievest, whose Interest cleaves to thee, <hi>(fidus Achates)</hi> even to the Period of thy Journey, becomes an Advocate to plead for thee at the Bar of Justice, effectually prevails for Mercy.</p>
            <p>Were there not an Enchantment in Avarice, who would not with ready Alacrity distribute temporal Comforts to others, to ascertain eternal to himself? Unmerciful Persons forfeit and bereave themselves of those Treasures they seem to retain, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the merciful retain those Treasures they seem to be bereaved of; their works, especially their
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43028:20"/>
Alms follow them, their riches are preserved, nay augmented to them; tho' not formally in kind, yet virtually in value, transcendently in a superlative Compensation.</p>
            <p>To rescue us from the Fascination, the Witchcraft of covetous desires, the grand Impediments, the utter Defiances of charitable Acts; there is requisite, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine auxiliary Grace, earnestly to be implored for, wherein let us not disdain to be disciplined by a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Pattern, the Honor of our Nation, <hi>(Mr. Sutton)</hi> not illustrious for Titles but Graces, dignified by unparalell'd Alms, by the renowned Monument of a munificent Hospital; Preparatory whereto, he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, vehemently supplicated; <hi>O Lord thou hast given me a plentiful Estate, give me a merciful Heart to dispose it to thy Glory.</hi> This pious Ejaculation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated in his own Garden, was overheard in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other adjacent to it, as it is attested by a modern Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Historian.</p>
            <p>To incourage this Duty of Charity, to fortifie the Stress of it against all the Attacks, and Stratagems of Satan; I have mustered up the holy Auxiliary Forces, the puissant motives of the strictest indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible rule of Justice, of the most undefiled, unfeigned exercise of Piety, of the brightest Lustre of a serene pure Reputation, of the most commodious inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Traffick, of the most delicious bosom Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: I have signalized these confluences of the choicest present Attractives, and Allurements of this World;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43028:21"/>
by the future Reserve, the Staple Requital of the Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, the Glories of the next. To conclude, God hath not endowed any of us with wealth, to be tainted with Vice, but to exercise, to promote Virtue, not to defray the profuse Expences of Varieties, of gay, modish, sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous Habits (the Banners of Pride and Vanity;) not for Sacrifices to our Palats, to administer Fuel to Flames of Luxury and Debauchery: nay not to raise our Families, not for Grandeur but Grace; not for to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Posterities great, but our selves good, and them also, in the Track of our Examples, in consecrating, in perpetuating our Riches, by pious charitable Uses; to repair, to adorn Fabricks, dedicated, set apart for sacred Ordinances, that God may be worshiped with the Beauty of Holiness.</p>
            <p>Let it not be a Reproach to the best reformed Religion, that in some places, where Personages fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with ample Revenues, bedecked with Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of Clothes, inhabit; Gods Houses should be less decent, less august and splendid than their own: that many rural parochial Churches hold Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances, both for the Structure and the Furniture, with Barns rather than Temples; Windows ungla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed or shattered, the Floors unpaved, deformed with Pits, the Roofs ungarnished even unceiled, in a Rudeness of Prophaneness; the Walls defaced with Gashes, hung with Cobwebs instead of Tapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, I wish from my Soul it were a Calumny to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43028:21"/>
assert it. This is not solemnly, awfully to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, to adore, but contemptibly, contumeliously to dishonour, to affront the most High. It hath an Aspect of an Indignity obtruded towards the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme divine Sovereign: (Churches being anciently dignified to be entituled, to be reputed <hi>Basilica,</hi> Palaces for Kings, even for the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings:)</hi> Whatever is in any degree related, appropriated to God, is degraded, desecrated, being in a mean Dress, exposed to Disesteem and Scorn.</p>
            <p>A cheap sordid Performance of religious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, is not to be interpreted the Service of God, but of <hi>Mammon;</hi> the refinement of which dross, the purifying of the Pollutions and unrighteousness thereof, cannot be effected, but by acts of Piety and Charity; in the one in reference to inanimate Piles, the other in reference to animate, the living Temples of the everliving God; being enriched, deputed, enjoyned, obliged we are by a special Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, to relieve the distresses of our indigent Brethren, appointed we are as Trustees for Supplies in their Exigences; if this Trust be uprightly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, our Fidelity herein will qualifie us to be interested in the Solace the Sentence of Absolution of the last day. <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father, inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the Kingdom prepared for you from the Foundation of the World. For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick,</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:43028:22"/>
               <hi>and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me: Math.</hi> 25. 34, 35, 36. Of this superlative, inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Recompence of Piety and Charity; (to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to everlasting Habitations in the Phrase of my Text) which cannot enter into us to understand, till we enter into it to possess it, the Lord of his infinite Mercy make us Partakers, for the merits of his blessed Son, by the Influences of his holy Spirit; to which sacred Trinity, be ascribed Glory, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Might, Majesty and Dominion, this day, and for ever.</p>
