            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

debased or layd aside. <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> devoted in their infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to ruine and obscurity, were by that eye and hand kept and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to highest honours and imployments for his Church.</p>
            <p>Some footsteps of which care and power, we have observed, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the birth and bringing forth to light of this Orphane: which, in relation to the painfull labour of him, who (as the Mother) brought it forth, and dyed in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell with it, wee thought might well be stiled BENNONI, <hi>Sonne of my sorrowes</hi>; But, when wee saw the strength and holinesse imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the child by <hi>God</hi> the father of it, wee doubted not to call it BENIAMIN, <hi>Sonne of the right
<pb facs="tcp:15479:3"/>
hand.</hi> For, as dying <hi>Jacob</hi> laid his right hand upon the youngest son of <hi>Joseph:</hi> So <hi>God</hi> did stretch forth his on this, the last issue of the <hi>dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Author</hi>; when out of a <hi>wombe</hi> (as then) <hi>so dead</hi> and <hi>dryed,</hi> hee brought forth a <hi>Man-child</hi> so strong and vigorous: As also, when by the Parents immature departure, it seemed to be adjud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to death and darknesse, that yet by the same hand it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, and at last through many hazards delivered unto us, who by the <hi>dying Parent,</hi> were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Mid-wives Office, in bringing it forth to the publike view.</p>
            <p>And, if we may estimate the writings of men, by the same rule
<pb facs="tcp:15479:4"/>
whereby wee are to judge of the works of <hi>God</hi> himselfe; and those workes of <hi>God</hi> excell the rest, which doe most cleerly shew forth him the <hi>Author</hi> of them: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Grace, though but an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the soule, is of farre more price with <hi>God,</hi> than all mens soules devoid of it, because it is the lively Image of his Holinesse, which is his beautie. VVe could not imagin, how this work should not bee valued when it came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, that presents to all mens understandings so cleare, evident and immediat expressions of <hi>God,</hi> his <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Attributes.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed what vast and boundless vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of heaven, earth &amp; hel, hath <hi>God</hi> bin pleased to publish to make
<pb facs="tcp:15479:4"/>
known his <hi>wrath, eternall power and God-head?</hi> and how long hath he continued that expensive worke of governing the world, to shew forth the <hi>riches of his goodnesse, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence &amp; forbearance?</hi> Yet when all were bound together; <hi>so little knew we of him,</hi> that he set forth his Son, <hi>the expresse Jmage of his Person,</hi> as the Last, and best Edition, that could be hoped for.</p>
            <p>And, it being much more true of <hi>God</hi> which is usually sayd of knowledge in the generall, <hi>Non habet inimicum nisi ignorantem,</hi> that being so good, he hath no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies nor strangers to him, but those that know him not; surely then the <hi>knowledge of him</hi> is a most necessary and effectuall means to friendship with him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15479:5"/>And indeed, As, <hi>that God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us,</hi> is the first <hi>Foundation</hi> of his Covenant of Mercie vvith us, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. So, our true and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury knowledge of him, is made the first entrance into covenant, continuing of acquaintance, and encreasing of communion with him, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31.33, 34. Yea fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as to make knowne himselfe was the utmost end of all his workes; <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19. So rightly to know him, is the best reward at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable by us for all our workes. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3. <hi>This is eternall Life to know thee, the onely true</hi> GOD, <hi>and</hi> IESVS CHRIST, <hi>whom thou hast sent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVhich great reward we doubt not, but this <hi>servant</hi> of <hi>God</hi> attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
<pb facs="tcp:15479:5"/>
VVho, after he had spent the most of his living, thoughts and breath in unfolding and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, the most proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Characters of Grace, which is <hi>Gods Jmage</hi>; whereby Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers came to be assured, that <hi>God</hi> is their <hi>God,</hi> and they in covenant with him; was in the end admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to exercise his last and dying thoughts, about the Essence, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes and Greatnesse of <hi>GOD</hi> Himselfe, who is their portion and exceeding great reward.</p>
            <p>In the very entrance almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which, hee was carried up so nigh to Heaven, that he came not downe againe, but dyed in the <hi>Mount</hi> into which (by <hi>Gods</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment) he was ascended; and
<pb facs="tcp:15479:6"/>
before many of <hi>Gods glorious back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts were passed by him,</hi> he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up to view the rest more fully <hi>Face to face.</hi> So that, as he was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his sicknes wont to say, <hi>J shall but change my place, and not my companie;</hi> we may also truly say, he did but change his studying place, not his thoughts nor stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. <hi>God</hi> being the only imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate subject about vvhich the studies of men and Angells are wholly taken up for all eternity.</p>
            <p>VVhich change, though to him full of gaine, had been to us more grievous, had not this little peece, like to ELIAHS <hi>mantle</hi> falne from him, <hi>as he was ascending.</hi> VVherein wee have those lofty speculations of the schools (which
<pb facs="tcp:15479:6"/>
like emptie clouds flie often high, but drop no fatnesse) digested in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to usefull applications, and distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into Spirit-full and quickning cordialls, to comfort and confirme the <hi>inward Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not onely shewing (as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) vvhat <hi>GOD</hi> is; but also what wee therefore ought to bee. At once, emblazoning the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Essence,</hi> and glorious <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes</hi> of <hi>God</hi>; and withall delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the most noble dispositions of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> in us, which are the prints and imitations of those his <hi>Attributes,</hi> applying as a skilfull builder, the patterne to the peece he was to frame. So, as by his unfinisht draught, it may be gathered, what inlarged and
<pb facs="tcp:15479:7"/>

God, and our selves, whereby we are taught the way to eternall life.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I call it [<hi>heavenly wisdome</hi>] for so it is called, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.13.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.13.</note> 
               <hi>The wisdome which we teach, is not in the words, which mans wisdome teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth.</hi> So likewise the Apostle in another place calls it, <hi>The forme of wholesome words</hi>;<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.13.</note> that is, That systeme, or comprehension of wholesome Doctrine delivered in the Scripture.</p>
            <p>Now it differs from other systemes, and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Sciences:<note place="margin">Theologie wherein it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sciences.</note>
            </p>

            <p n="2">2 Againe, all other sciences are taught by men, but this is taught by the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 All other knowledge is delivered in the writings of men, but this is revealed to us in the holy Word of <hi>God,</hi> which was written by <hi>God</hi> himselfe, though men were the mediate pen-men of it; therefore, I adde that, to distinguish it from all other Sciences; that, <hi>It is not revealed by men, but by the holy Ghost, not in bookes written by men, but in the holy Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> In the next place I adde the object, about which this wisdome is conversant, it is <hi>the knowledge of God, and of our selves.</hi> And so it is likewise distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from all other knowledge, which hath some other objects. It is the knowledge of <hi>God,</hi> that is, of <hi>God,</hi> not simply considered, or abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, in his Essence, but as he is in reference and relation to us.</p>
            <p>And againe, it is not simply the knowledge of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:15479:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
our selves, (for many things in us belong to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther arts and sciences) but as wee stand in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to <hi>God</hi>; so that these are the two parts of it; the knowledge of <hi>God,</hi> in reference to us; and of our selves, in reference to him.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Last of all, it is distinguished by the end, towhich it tends, which it aymes at, which is to <hi>teach us the way to eternall life:</hi> And therein it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from all other sciences whatsoever; for they onely helpe some defects of understanding here in this present life: for where there is some fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or defect,<note place="margin">Arts, why in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</note> which common reason doth not helpe, there arts are invented to supply and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie those defects; but this doth somewhat more, it leads us the way to eternall life: for, as it hath in it a principall above all others, so it hath an higher end than others: for as the well-head is higher, so the streams ascend higher than others.

                  <item>2 By faith.<note place="margin">2 What <hi>God</hi> is.</note>

               <hi>For the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:15479:18"/>
things of him, that is, his eternall power, and God-head, are seene by the creation of the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing considered in his workes, so that they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuse.</hi> So likewise, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.27, 28. you shall see there what the Apostle saith,<note place="margin">Acts 17.</note> that they should <hi>seeke after the Lord, if happily they might grope af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, and finde him: for he is not farre from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of us: for in him we live, move, and have our being:</hi> That is, by the very things that wee handle and touch, wee may know that there is a <hi>God</hi>; and also, by our owne life, motion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we may learne that there is a Dietie, from whence these proceed: For the Apostle speaketh this to them, that had no Scripture to teach them. So likewise, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.17.<note place="margin">Acts 14.17.</note> 
               <hi>Neverthelesse, hee hath not left himselfe without witnesse, in giving us fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full seasons:</hi> As if those did beare witnesse of him, that is, those workes of his in the creatures. So that you see, there are two wayes to come to the knowledge of this, that <hi>God</hi> is; One, I say, is by naturall reason: Or else to make it more plaine, we shall see this in these two things:</p>
            <p n="1">1 There is enough in the very creation of the world, to declare him unto us.</p>
            <p n="2">2 There is a light of the understanding, or reason, put into us, whereby we are able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne those characters of <hi>God</hi> stamped in the creatures, whereby we may discerne the <hi>invisible things of God, his infinite power and wisdome</hi>; and when these are put together, that which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the creature, there are arguments enough in them, and in us there is reason enough, to see
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:15479:18"/>
the force of those arguments, and thence we may conclude that there is a GOD, besides the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Scripture, that wee have to reveale it. For, though I said before, that Divinity was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by the HOLY GHOST, yet there is this difference in the points of <hi>Theologie:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Difference in points of The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologie.</note> Some truths are wholly revealed, and have no foot-steps in the creatures, no prints in the creation, or in the workes of GOD, to discerne them by, and such are all the mysteries of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> and of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie:</hi> other truths there are, that have some <hi>vestigia,</hi> some characters stamped upon the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereby wee may discerne them, and such is this which wee now have in hand, that, <hi>There is a God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 That there is a God.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore we will shew you these two things:
<list>
                  <item>1 How it is manifest from the creation.</item>
                  <item>2 How this point is evident to you by faith.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 A third thing i will adde, that this God whom we worship, is the only true God.</p>
            <p>Now for the first, to explicate this, that, <hi>The power and God-head is seene in the creation of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides those Demonstrations else-where handled,<note place="margin">See <hi>the sensible Demonstration of the Deitie</hi> in the beginning.</note> drawne from the Creation in generall, as from:</p>
            <p n="1">1 The sweet concent and harmony the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have among themselves.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The fitnesse and proportion of one unto another.</p>
            <p n="3">3 From the reasonable actions of creatures, in themselves unreasonable.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:15479:19"/>4 The great and orderly provision that is made for all things.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The combination and dependance that is among them.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The impressions of skill and workmanship that is upon the creatures. All which argue that there is a <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There remaine three other principall argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to demonstrate this:</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The consideration of the <hi>Originall of all things,</hi> which argues that they must needs bee made by GOD,<note place="margin">The considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of all things proved.</note> the Maker of Heaven and Earth; which wee will make good to you by these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars:</p>
            <p>If man was made by him, for whom all things are made,<note place="margin">1 By the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of man.</note> then it is certaine that they are made also. For the argument holds; If the best things in the world must have a beginning, then surely those things that are subserving, and subordinate to them, must much more have a beginning.</p>
            <p>Now that man was made by him,<note place="margin">That man was made.</note> consider but this reason;</p>
            <p>The father that begets, knowes not the making of him; the mother that conceives, knowes it not; neither doth the formative vertue, (as we call it) that is, that vigour that is in the materials, that shapes, and fashions, and articulates the body in the wombe, that knowes not what it doth. Now is is certaine; that he that makes any thing, must needs know it perfectly, and all the parts of it, though the stander by may be ignorant of it. As for example; he that makes a statue, knowes how

every particle is made; he that makes a Watch, or any ordinary worke of art, he knowes all the junctures, all the wheeles, and commissures of it, or else it is impossible that hee should make it: now all these that have a hand in making of man, know not the making of him, not the father, nor the mother, nor that which wee call the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive vertue, that is, that vigour which is in the materials, which workes and fashions the bodie, as the work-man doth a statue, and gives severall limbes to it, all these know it not: therefore hee must needs be made by <hi>God,</hi> and not by man: and therefore see how the Wise-man reasons, <hi>Psal.</hi> 94.9.<note place="margin">Psal. 94.9.</note> 
               <hi>Hee that made the eye, shall he not see? he that made the eare, shall not he heare?</hi> &amp;c. that is, he that is the maker of the engines, or organes, or senses, or limbes of the body, or hee that is maker of the soule, and faculties of it, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that he must know, though others doe not, the making of the body and soule, the turnings of the will, and the windings of the understanding; all those other are but as pensils in the hand of him that doth all; the pensill knowes not what it doth, though it drawes all, it is guided by the hand of a skilfull Painter, else it could do nothing; the Painter only knoweth what he doth; so that formative vertue, that vigour that formes the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of a man, that knowes no more what it doth, than the pensill doth, but he in whose hand it is, who sets it on worke, it is he that gives vigour and vertue to that seed in the womb, from whence the bodie is raised, it is he that knows it, for it is he
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:15479:20"/>
that makes it. And this is the first particular by which wee prove that things were made, and had not their originall from themselves. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is:</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> If things were not made, then, it is certaine, that they must have a being from themselves:<note place="margin">Because else the creatures should be Gods.</note> Now to have a being from it selfe, is nothing else but to be <hi>God:</hi> for it is an inseparable propertie of <hi>God,</hi> to have his being from himselfe. Now if you will acknowledge, that the creatures had a being of themselves, they must needs be <hi>Gods</hi>; for it belongs to him alone, to have a being of himselfe, and from himselfe. The third followes, which I would have you chiefly to marke.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> If things have a being from themselves, it is certaine then that they are without causes;<note place="margin">Else the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures should be without Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> as for example; That which hath no efficient cause, (that is) no maker, that hath no end. Looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the workes made by man (that we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse it to you;) take an house, or any worke, or instrument that man makes; therefore it hath an end, because he that made it, propounded such an end to himselfe; but if it have no maker, it can have no end: for the end of any thing is that which the maker aymes at. Now if things have no end, they could have no forme: for the forme and fashion of every thing ariseth only from the end, which the maker propounds to himselfe; as for example, the reason, why a knife hath such a fashion, is, because it was the end of the maker, to have it an instrument to cut with: the reason why an axe or hatchet hath another fashion, is, because
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:15479:20"/>
it might be an instrument to chop with; and the reason, why a key hath another fashion different from these, is, because the maker propounded to himselfe another end, in making of it, namely, to open lockes with; these are all made of the same matter, that is, of iron, but they have divers fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions, because they have severall ends, which the maker propounds to himselfe. So that, if there be no ends of things, there is no forme, nor fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion of them, because the ground of all their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions, is their severall ends. So then wee will put them all together; if there be no efficient, no maker of them, then there is no end, and if there be no end, then there is no forme nor fashion, and if there be no forme, then there is no matter, and so consequently, they have no cause; and that which is without any cause, must needs bee <hi>God</hi>; which I am sure none dares to affirme; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have not their being of themselves. But besides that negative argument, by bringing it to an impossibilitie, that the creatures should be <hi>Gods,</hi> wee will make it plaine by an affirmative argument, that all the creatures have an end.</p>
            <p>For looke upon all the creatures, and we shall see that they have an end;<note place="margin">All creatures have an end.</note> the end of the Sunne, Moone and Starres is, to serve the Earth; and the end of the Earth is, to bring forth Plants; and the end of Plants is, to feed the beasts: and so if you looke to all particular things else, you shall see that they have an end, and if they have an end, it is certaine, there is one did ayme at it, and did give those creatures, those several fashions, which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:15479:21"/>
those severall ends did require: As for example, What is the reason, why a horse hath one fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a dog another, sheepe another, and oxen ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? The reason is plaine, a horse was made to runne, and to carry men; the oxen to plow; a dog to hunt, and so of the rest. Now this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without an author, without a maker, from whom they have their beginning. So likewise this is plaine by the effects: for this is a sure rule: Whatsoever it is, that hath no other end, but it selfe, that seekes to provide for its owne happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in looking no further than it selfe; and this is only in <hi>God,</hi> blessed for ever; he hath no end but himselfe, no cause above himselfe, therefore he lookes only to himselfe, and therein doth his happinesse consist. Take any thing that will not goe out of its owne sphere, but dwels within its owne compasse, stands upon its owne bottome to seeke its happinesse, that thing destroyes it selfe; looke to any of the creatures, and let them not stirre out of their owne shell, they perish there. So, take a man that hath no further end than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,<note place="margin">When a man maketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe his end he destroyeth himselfe.</note> let him seeke himselfe, make himselfe his end in all things he doth, looke only to his owne profit and commodity, such a man destroyes himselfe: for he is made to serve <hi>God,</hi> and men, and therein doth his happinesse consist, because that hee is made for such an end: take those that have beene serviceable to <hi>God,</hi> and men, that have spent themselves in serving <hi>God,</hi> with a perfect heart, we see that such men are happie men; and doe we not finde it by experience, that those
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:15479:21"/>
that have gone a contrary way, have destroyed themselves? And this is the third particular.</p>

For, if wee consider what eternity is, and what the vastnesse of it is, that when you have thought of millions of millions of yeares, yet still there is more beyond: if the world hath been of so long continuance, what is the reason, that things are but, as it were, newly ripened? what is the reason, that things are of no greater anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity than they are? Take all the Writers that ever wrote, (besides the Scripture) and they all exceed not above foure thousand yeares; for they almost all agree in this, that the first man, that had ever any history written of him, was <hi>Ninus,</hi> who lived about <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, or a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; <hi>Trogus Pompeius,</hi> and <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in this. <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith, that <hi>Theseus,</hi> was the first, before him there was no history of truth, nothing credible; and this is his expression: Take the Histories of times before <hi>Theseus,</hi> and you shall finde them to be but like skirts, in the maps, wherein you shall finde nothing but vast Seas. <hi>Varro,</hi> one of the most learned of their Writers, professeth, that before the kingdome of the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyonians,</hi> which begun after <hi>Ninus</hi> time, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time nothing was certaine, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of that was doubtfull, and uncertain. And their usuall division of all history, into fabulous, and certaine, by Historians, is well knowne, to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:15479:22"/>
those that are conversant in them; and yet the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians, that are of any truth, began long after the Captivitie in <hi>Babylon</hi>; for <hi>Herodotus,</hi> that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved after <hi>Esthers</hi> time, is counted the first that ever wrote in Prose, and he was above eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares after <hi>Moses</hi> time. For conclusion of this, we will only say, that which one of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientest of the <hi>Roman</hi> Poets, drawing this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion from the argument we have in hand, saith, If things were from eternitie, and had not a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning;
<q>
                  <l>Cur supra bellum Thebanum &amp; funera Trojae</l>
                  <l>Non alias alii quoque res cecinere Poetae?</l>
               </q>
               <hi>If things were from eternitie, what is the reason, that before the Theban and Trojan warre, all the ancient Poets, and ancient Writers did not make mention of any thing?</hi> Doe you thinke, if things had beene from eternitie, there would be no monuments of them, if you consider the vastnesse of eternitie, what it is? So likewise for the beginning of Arts and Sciences; what is the reason that the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of them is knowne? why were they no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner found out? why are they not sooner perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted? Printing, you know, is a late invention; and so is the invention of Letters: take all Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the ancientest, as <hi>Astrologie</hi> and <hi>Philosophy,</hi> as well as the <hi>Mathematickes</hi>; why are their authors yet known, &amp; we see them in the blade, and not in the fruit? So for the <hi>Genealogies</hi> of men (for that I touch, because it is an argument insinuated by <hi>Paul,</hi> when hee disputed with the Heathens,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:15479:22"/>
               <hi>Acts</hi> 17.26. <hi>That God hath made of one bloud all mankinde</hi>) you see evidently how one man begets another, and he another, &amp;c. and so goe and take all the <hi>Genealogies</hi> in the Scripture, and in all other historiographers, we shall see, that they all come to one well-head. Now, I aske, if the world was from eternitie, what is the reason that there is but one fountaine, one bloud whereof we are all made? Why should they not be made all together? Why was not the earth peopled together, and in every Land a multitude of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants together, if they had beene from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and had no beginning?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second principall Head, by which wee will make this good to you, that <hi>there is a God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">That there is a <hi>God,</hi> proved by the Law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in mens hearts.</note> that made Heaven and Earth, is, the testimony of <hi>God</hi> himselfe. There is a double testimony; one is the written testimony, which we have in the Scripture; the other is, that testimony, which is <hi>written in the hearts of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, you know that all Nations do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a <hi>God,</hi> (this we take for granted) yea, even those that have been lately discovered, that live, as it were, disjoyned from the rest of the world, yet they all have, and worship a <hi>God</hi>; those Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions discovered lately by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in the <hi>West Indies,</hi> and those that have beene discovered since; all of them, without exception, have it written in their hearts, that <hi>there is a God.</hi> Now the strength of the argument lies in these two things:</p>
            <p n="1">1 I observe that phrase used, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. It is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:15479:23"/>
called <hi>a law written in their hearts.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1.1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> Every mans soule is but, as it were, the table or paper, upon which the writing is; the thing written is this principle that we are now upon, that <hi>there is a God,</hi> that made Heaven and Earth: but now who is the Writer? surely it is <hi>God,</hi> which is evident by this; because it is a generall effect in the heart of every man living, and therefore it must come from a generall cause: from whence else shall it proceed? no particular cause can produce it; if it were, or had beene taught by some particular man, by some sect, in some one Nation or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in one age, then, knowing the cause, wee should see that the effect would not exceed it, but when you finde it in the hearts of all men, in all Nations and ages; then you must conclude, it was an universall effect, written by the generall Author of all things, which is <hi>God</hi> alone; and so consequently, the argument hath this strength in it, that it is the testimony of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 Besides, when you see every man looking after a <hi>God,</hi> and seeking him, it is an argument that there is one, though they doe not finde him: it is true, they pitch upon a false god, and goe the wrong way to seeke him, yet it shewes that there is such a Deity. For as in other things; when we see one affect that thing which another doth not; as to the eye of one, that is beautifull which is not to another, yet all affecting some beauty; it is an argument that beauty is the general object of all, and so in taste &amp; other senses. So when we see men going different waies, some worshipping one <hi>God,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:15479:23"/>
some another, yet all conspiring in this, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship a <hi>God,</hi> it must needs argue that there is one: for this law ingraven in every mans heart, you will grant that it is a work of Nature at least, and the workes of Nature are not in vaine; even as, when you see the fire to ascend above the aire, it argues that there is a place where it would rest, though you never saw it; and as, in winter, when you see the Swallowes flying to a place, though you never saw the place, yet you must needs ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that there is one which Nature hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, and hath given them an instinct to flye unto, and there to be at rest; so when you see in every mans soule such an instigation to seeke <hi>God,</hi> though men never saw him, and the most goe the wrong way to seeke him, and take that for <hi>God</hi> which is not, yet this argues there is a Deitie which they intend. And this is the third.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The last argument is taken from the soule of man,<note place="margin">The same truth is proved by the soule of man.</note> 
               <hi>the fashion of it, and the immortality of it.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, <hi>God</hi> is said to have <hi>made man after his owne Image;</hi> hee doth not meane his bodie, for that is not made after the Image of God; neither is it only that holinesse which was created in us, and now lost: for then he would not have said, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6.<note place="margin">Gen. 9.6</note> 
               <hi>He that sheds mans bloud, by man shall his bloud be shed, for in the Image of</hi> GOD <hi>made hee man.</hi> The principall intent of that place, is (for ought I can see or judge) of that Scripture (spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the naturall fashion of things, and not of the supernaturall graces) it is, to expresse that <hi>God</hi> hath given a soule to man, that carries the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:15479:24"/>
Image of <hi>God,</hi> a likenesse to the Essence of <hi>God,</hi> immateriall, immortall, invisible; for there is a double Image of <hi>God</hi> in the soule, one in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of it, which is never lost; another is the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall grace, which is an Image of the knowledge, holinesse, and righteousnesse of <hi>God,</hi> and this is utterly lost. But the soule is the Image of the Essence of <hi>God,</hi> (as I may so speake) that is, it is a spirit immateriall, immortall, invisible, as he is; hath understanding and will, as he hath; he understands all things, and wils whatsoever he pleaseth. And you see an expression of him in your owne soule, which is an argument of the Deitie.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, besides, the immortalitie of the soule, which argues it came not from any thing here below, but that it hath its originall from <hi>God; it came from</hi> GOD, <hi>and to</hi> GOD <hi>it must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne</hi>; that is, it had not any beginning here, it had it from him, and to him againe it must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne. For what is this body, wherein the soule is? it is but the case of the soule, the shell, and sheath of it; therefore the soule useth it but for a time, and dwels in it, as a man dwels in a house, while it is habitable, but when it is growne rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, he departeth: the soule useth the body, as a man doth a vessell, when it is broken, he layes it aside; or as a man doth an instrument, whilest it will be serviceable to him; but when it is no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger fit to play upon, he casts it aside; so doth the soule, as it were, lay aside the body: for it is but as a garment that a man useth; when it is worne
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:15479:24"/>
out, and threed-bare, he casts it off: so doth the soule with the body. And for the further proofe of this, and that it depends not on the body, nor hath its originall of it, or by it; consider the great acts of the soule, which are such, as cannot arise from the temper of the matter, be it never so curious: As the discourse of the soule from one generall to another; the apprehension of so high things, as <hi>God,</hi> and Angels; the devising of such things as never came into the senses. For, though it be true, that sounds and colours be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the understanding by the senses; yet to make pictures of these colours, and musicke of these sounds, this is from the understanding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: So the remembrance of things past; obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the condition of things, by comparing one with another. Now, looke upon bruit beasts, we see no actions but may arise from the temper of the matter; according to which their fancie and appetite are fashioned; though some actions are stronger than others, yet they arise not above the Well-head of sense: all those extraordinary things, which they are taught to doe, it is but for their food, as Hawkes, and some Pigeons, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, in <hi>Assyria</hi> that they carry Letters from one place to another, where they use to have food; so other beasts that act dancing, and such like motions, it is done by working on their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: but come to man, there are other actions of his understanding and will in the soule: It is true indeed, in a man there are fancie and appetite, and these arise from the temper of the body; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:15479:25"/>
as the body hath a different temper, so there are severall appetites, dispositions and affections; some man longs after one thing, some after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but these are but the severall turnings of the sensuall appetite, (which is also seene in beasts) therefore when the soule is gone, these remaine no longer; but come to the higher part of the soule, the actions of the will, and understanding of man, and they are of an higher nature; the acts which they doe, have no dependance upon the body at all: Besides, come to the motions of the body; the soule guides and moves the body, as a Pilot doth a ship, (now the Pilot may be safe, though the ship be split upon the rocke.) Looke on beasts, they are led wholly as their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite carries them, and they must goe that way; therefore they are not ruled, as a Pilot governes a ship: but in men, their appetites would carry them hither, or thither, but the will saith no, and that hath the understanding for its counseller. So that the motions of the body arise not from the diversity of the sensuall appetites, as in all other creatures, but of the will and understanding; for the soule depends not upon the body, but the acts of the body depend upon it: therefore, when the body perisheth, the soule dies not; but, as a man that dwels in a house; if the house fall, he hath no dependance on it, but may goe away to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther house; so the soule hath no dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bodie at all; therefore you must not think that it doth die when the body perisheth.</p>
            <p>Besides, the soule is not worne, it is not weary,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:15479:25"/>
as other things are; the body is weary, and the spirits are weary: the body weares, as doth a garment, till it be wholly worne out: now, any thing that is not weary, it cannot perish; but, in the very actions of the soule it selfe there is no wearinesse, but whatsoever comes into the soule perfects it, with a naturall perfection, and it is the stronger for it; therefore it cannot be subject to decay, it cannot weare out, as other things doe, but the more notions it hath, the more perfect it is: the body, indeed, is weary with labour, and the spirits are weary, but the soule is not weary, but in the immediate acts of it, the soule it works still, even when the body sleepeth: Looke upon all the actions of the soule, and they are indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and as their independencie growes, so the soule growes younger and younger, and stronger and stronger, <hi>senescens juvenescit,</hi> and is not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to decay, or mortalitie: as you see in a Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, it growes still, and so the shell breakes, and falls off: so is it with the soule, the body hangs on it, but as a shell, and when the soule is growne to perfection, it falls away, and the soule returnes to the Maker.</p>
            <p>The next thing that I should come to,<note place="margin">The second way to prove, <hi>that God is, is</hi> by faith.</note> is to shew you how this is made evident by faith. When a man hath some rude thoughts of a thing, and hath some reason for it, he then begins to have some perswasion of it; but when, besides, a man wise and true, shall come, and tell him it is so, this addes much strength to his confidence: for when you come to discerne this <hi>God-head,</hi> and to know
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:15479:26"/>
it by reasons from the creatures, this may give you some perswasion; but when one shall come, and tell you out of the Scripture, made by a wise and true <hi>God,</hi> that it is so indeed; this makes you confirmed in it. Therefore the strength of the argument by faith, you may gather after this manner: Yee beleeve the Scriptures to be true, and that they are the Word of <hi>God</hi>; now this is contained in the Scriptures, that <hi>God made Heaven and Earth</hi>; therefore, beleeving the Scriptures to be the Word of <hi>God,</hi> and whatsoever is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in them; hence faith layes hold upon it also, and so our consent growes strong and firme, that there is a <hi>God:</hi> After this manner you come to conclude it by faith. For what is faith? Faith is, but when a thing is propounded to you, even as an object set before the eye, there is an habit of faith within, that sees it what it is; for faith is nothing else, but a seeing of that which is: for though a thing is not true, because I beleeve it is so, yet things first are, and then I beleeve them. Faith doth not beleeve things imaginary, and such as have no ground; but whatsoever faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves, it hath a being, and the things we beleeve, doe lye before the eye of reason, sanctified and elevated by the eye of faith; therefore <hi>Moses,</hi> when he goes about to set downe the Scripture, hee doth not prove things by reason, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds them, as, <hi>In the beginning</hi> GOD <hi>made the Heaven and Earth</hi>; he propounds the object, and leaves it to the eye of faith to looke upon. For the nature of faith is this: <hi>God</hi> hath given to man
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:15479:26"/>
an understanding facultie, (which we call, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) the object of this is all the truths that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in the world, &amp; whatsoever hath a being. Now take all things that we are said to beleeve, and they also are things <hi>that are,</hi> and which are the true objects of the understanding and reason. But the understanding hath objects of two sorts:</p>

So that indeed, Faith, it is but the lifting up of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, by adding a new light to them and it; and therefore they are said to be revealed, not because they were not before, as if the revealing of them gave a being unto them; but, even as a new light in the night discovers to us that which we did not see before, and as a prospective glasse reveales to the eye, that which we could not see before, and by its owne power, the eye could not

Now to draw this a little nearer, that invisible, immateriall substance, the soule of man which stands at the doores of the body, and lookes out at the windows of the eyes, and of the eares, both to see and heare, which yet wee see not; yet it is this soule that doth all these; for if the soule be once gone out of the house of the body, the eye sees no more, the eare heares no more, than an house or chamber can see, when there is no body in it; and as it is the spirituall substance within the body that sees, and heares, and understands all; so apply this to <hi>God</hi> that dwells in Heaven and Earth; that as, though you see not the soule, yet every part of the body is full of it; so if we looke into the world, we see that it is filled, and yet <hi>God</hi> (like as the soule) is in every place, and fills it with his presence; he is present with every creature, he is in the aire, and in your selves, and seeth al your actions, and heareth al your words; and if we could bring our selves to a setled per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of this, it would cause us to walke more evenly with <hi>God</hi> than we do, and to converse with him after another manner; when a man is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,

            <p n="1">1 The course of Nature hath beene turned many times, as those miracles that the LORD wrought in stopping the course of the Sunne, and making of it go backward; he made the waters to runne a contrary course, and stopped the heat of the fire, and the efficacie of it, so that it could doe the three Children no harme.</p>

of its course, as in our bodies there be sicknesses and distempers, so there are in the great bodie of the World, strange inundations, stirres and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; now if there were not a free Agent, that governes these, why are these things so, and why no more? why doe these things goe so far, and no further? why are there any alterations at all? and when any alterations come to passe, who is he that stoppeth them? why doth the sea over-flow some places, and goe no further? who is he that sets bounds to them, but only the <hi>Lord?</hi> Therfore this we may learne from it, the constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of these things shewes the wisdome of <hi>God</hi>; as it is wisdome in us to doe things constantly: and againe, the variety of things shewes the liberty of the Agent; for the actions of Nature are determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to one, but <hi>God</hi> shewes his liberty in this, that he can change and alter them at his pleasure.</p>
            <p>Besides, the things that are ordinary amongst us, wherein there is no such swarving, but they are constant in their course; doth not <hi>God</hi> guide them, and dispose of them as he pleaseth? as the former and latter raine: doth not <hi>God</hi> give more or lesse, according to his good pleasure? which shewes, that all things have not continued alike, but that there is a <hi>God,</hi> that governes the world. And as it is thus with naturall things, so in other things also; you shall see some judgements and rewards upon some, and not upon others.</p>

               </label> For answer of this, looke in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. where you have an expression of this,<note place="margin">Ezek. 1.</note> of things running
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:15479:33"/>
upon wheeles: wherein you may observe these things:</p>
            <p n="1">1 That all things here below are exceeding mutable; and therefore compared to <hi>Wheeles,</hi> and they are turned about as easie as a wheele, so that a man may wonder at their variety and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p n="2">2 But yet, these wheeles have <hi>eyes</hi> in them, that is, though we see not the reason of things in them, yet they have eyes in them, they have something to be discerned; the speech is a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor, and a metonymie too, shewing that there is something in their events, that may shew the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their Turning, if we could discerne it, but it is oft hidden from us.</p>
            <p n="3">3 And these <hi>Wheeles</hi> are <hi>stirred,</hi> but <hi>as the beasts stirre them</hi>; that is, there is nothing done here below, but they are done by the instruments of <hi>God,</hi> namely, the Angels.</p>
            <p n="4">4 And these Angels, first, <hi>have faces like men,</hi> that is, the wisdome of men; and on the other side, secondly, <hi>a face like a Lion,</hi> for their strength; thirdly, there is service, and laboriousnesse in them, as in <hi>Oxen:</hi> fourthly, there is swiftnesse in them, as in <hi>Eagles</hi>; and this is meant of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, that order and guide the course of things, and change them, as we see continually.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Againe, as these <hi>Wheeles</hi> move not, but as they are guided by them, and both move by <hi>the Spirit,</hi> that is, what <hi>God</hi> commands them, they execute, they goe, when he would have them go, and stand still, when he would have them.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:15479:34"/>6 Againe, for the manner of their motion; <hi>every one of them had foure faces</hi>; that is, they could looke every way, from East to West, and from North to South, when as man can see but one way, before him, he cannot looke on the right side, or the left, or behinde him, and therefore he may be deceived; but these looke every way. So also the <hi>feet,</hi> on which they goe, are not like mens feet, to goe forward only, but <hi>like calves feet,</hi> that is, they were round feet, which goe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forward or backward, so, as they are easily turned; and as they see every way, so they are apt to goe every way, and this with the greatest facilitie that can be. Let a man set any thing on worke, and it must needs runne in such a chanell, in such a way, he cannot change it suddenly: But it is not so with <hi>God,</hi> hee can alter a thing as easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the left hand, as to the right, and that in an instant.</p>

               </label> Well, saith the <hi>Lord,</hi> this is to bee conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red further, that <hi>one wheele is within another,</hi> and the <hi>wings of the Angels are one within another</hi>; there is a sutablenesse, and an agreeablenesse betweene them: so that take the changes of a thousand yeares, and, if you summe them up, you shall finde them, as wheeles, one within another. Therefore I would summe up the answer thus;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:15479:34"/>
this deceives us, we look upon <hi>Gods</hi> providence, in some few particulars only, that we looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a wheele or two, and not as they are one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in another; for then, indeed, we should see things that might cause us to wonder: as we see <hi>Ioseph,</hi> an innocent man, lying in disgrace and imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and <hi>David,</hi> though innocent, yet a long time disgraced in the Court of <hi>Saul,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Shimei</hi> cursing him; yea, wee see <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> himselfe delivered and condemned for an impostor, and that by witnesses, and in a legall manner: so we see <hi>Paul,</hi> one that was a man, full of zeale, yet accounted one of the worst men, that lived in his time: and <hi>Naboth,</hi> an innocent man condemned to death by witnesses, &amp; stoned, and who shall rise againe to shew his innocencie? If you looke but upon a wheele or two, you shall finde the Church ready to bee swallowed up in <hi>Esters</hi> time; but if you looke upon them all at once, then you will see, that these passages have eyes in them, and that they have Angels, and the Spirit to guide them. As for example, looke on all the wheeles of <hi>Iosephs</hi> life, you shall see the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie of his brethren, selling him to the steward of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> house, and there his falling out with his mistresse, his casting into prison, and there mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with <hi>Pharaohs</hi> officers; he was thereby made knowne to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and so he became great in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court; and then you see it is a goodly worke. So in <hi>David,</hi> take all the wheeles toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and you shall see a glorious work; how <hi>God</hi> brought him along to the Kingdome; <hi>God</hi> was
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:15479:35"/>
with him, and wrought his works for him, when he did sit still; and when his hand was not upon <hi>Saul,</hi> then he sent the <hi>Philistines</hi> to vex him, and to end his dayes: and first hee gave <hi>David</hi> the Kingdome of <hi>Iudah</hi>; and then afterwards <hi>Abner</hi> and <hi>Isobosheth</hi> fell out about a word, and one of them was slaine; and then also came two wicked men, and tooke off the others head, and so came home the whole Kingdome of <hi>Israel</hi> into his hand. So also in <hi>Esthers</hi> time, take all the wheeles together, and you shall see an excellent act of <hi>Gods</hi> providence, when the Church was ready to be destroyed, when the neck was upon the block, and the sword drawne out ready to strike, and that that night the King should not sleepe, but that a booke must be brought, and rather that than another, and that the place should be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, where he should finde <hi>Mordecai</hi> his revealing of the treason against him, and thereupon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree was revoked, and the Church delivered: I say, take all these together, and we shall plainly see, that in this strange administration of things, there is still a providence, and that there are eyes in the wheeles, and a spirit to guide them.</p>

Besides, we are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten mistaken; for that which we thinke to be ill to us, is many times for our good; and that which we thinke is very happie and prosperous, may be hurtfull to us. As for example, when <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> came from <hi>Laban,</hi> GOD said to him; <hi>Be not afraid, I am with thee, and I will doe thee good.</hi> You see, <hi>Iacob</hi> was no sooner gone, but <hi>Laban</hi> follows him, and would have done him much hurt, had not the <hi>Lord</hi> taken him off: No sooner was <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> gone from him, but <hi>Esau</hi> comes against him, and when the <hi>Lord</hi> had rescued him from him; when he was come neerer home, when he might have expected some rest after his weary journey; yet then his daughter was ravished, and his two sonnes were rebellious, and committed murther; after that <hi>Rachel</hi> died, and <hi>Deborah,</hi> who was <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beccah's</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:15479:36"/>
nurse, who was a good woman, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a great losse to his family; after all this, a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine fell upon him; yet for all this, <hi>God</hi> said that he would doe him good; and doubtlesse, <hi>God</hi> was as good as his word, and hee did him good: for that medicine is good, that doth us good, though it be bitter, and so was it with these afflictions. So <hi>Paul,</hi> he prayed that he might have an happie journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> and no doubt, <hi>the</hi> LORD heard his prayer, as appeareth by the <hi>Lords</hi> appearing to him; yet see what a kinde of prosperous jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney he had; what a deale of trouble did he meet with? Being in great afflictions, he went to <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> thinking there to be comforted by the <hi>Saints</hi>; and when he came thither hee went into the Temple, thinking he had well provided for himselfe; but then he was hardly entertained, put into prison, and sent bound to <hi>Caesarea,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, was in many perils upon the sea. And this was the prosperous journey that <hi>Paul</hi> had, and surely it was happie, and did much good to his owne soule, whereby he did good to others; a journey that led him into many experiments of <hi>Gods</hi> providence, and goodnesse towards him: therefore wee must not judge according to the outside, or that which the world accounts of, and appeares to be evill, for they may be causes of much good to us: therefore Saint <hi>Iames</hi> wils us, <hi>Iames</hi> 1.2, 3. <hi>to rejoyce when wee fall into divers temptations,</hi>

more, and grow more: therefore, saith he, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, when you fall into variety of them; for the variety of them will cure that variety of evils and diseases in us; as poverty may do that which sicknesse cannot do, and imprisonment may heale that which povertie or disgrace cannot doe, &amp;c. So on the contrary, those good things are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes good, which we account good; as when a man goes on from one good blessing to another, and is carried with a prosperous wind, and findes no change in any thing; this may also tend to his hurt and destruction, as the other to his salvation; these slay the foolish, even as the other save the godly: for these often-times doe make the soule fouler and fouler, and make it to be more rustie. This want of changes makes men to depart from <hi>God,</hi> and fall into evill; whereas the other makes us the more carefully to cleanse our wayes, and to cleave more firmely to him: Therefore, let us take heed that we be not deceived about these evils.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>1</label> I answer, after this manner: There is a double  assent: One is a doubtfull assent, which we call Opinion, that is, when we assent to the one part, so as we feare the contrary to be true.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The other is, a firme assent, and this is two-fold: Either it is grounded upon reason, which we call Knowledge; or else is grounded upon the authoritie of him that reveales it; and this wee call Faith. And the difference of them stands in this: The objects of the first, which wee call Knowledge, are naturall things, such as <hi>God</hi> did not reveale <hi>himselfe,</hi> but they lye before us, and reason can finde them out: but Faith beleeveth things that are revealed by <hi>God,</hi> yet so, as that there is no reason for them, as well as for the other. For if one come and tell you any thing, and if you beleeve it, you can give a reason of it, and why you beleeve it, aswell as of any other natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conclusion; as that he is a wise man, and one that I know will tell the truth, I have had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of him heretofore, &amp;c. Even so, when you beleeve the Scriptures, you can give a reason for it; it is, because <hi>God</hi> delivered it, and he cannot lye; but now, how doe yee know that <hi>God</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it? Because the men that delivered it, in his Name, did confirme it by workes, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and predictions of times; so that reason runnes along together with Faith: Onely there is this difference betweene them; Faith addeth
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:15479:39"/>
to the eye of reason, and raiseth it higher; for the understanding is conversant, as about things of reason, so about things of Faith; for they are propounded to the understanding, onely they are above it, and must have faith to reveale them; as when <hi>Moses</hi> saith, <hi>In the beginning,</hi> GOD <hi>made the Heaven and the Earth:</hi> when we heare such a proposition, reason doth but looke upon it, and cannot see it at first, but Faith helpeth reason to goe further: therefore Faith is but an addition to the strength of reason; when it could goe no further, Faith makes it to goe further: as one that hath dimme eyes, he can see better with the help of spectacles: even so doth the eye of reason, by a supernaturall faith infused. So that all the things which we beleeve, have a credibilitie and entity in them, and they are the objects of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; but we cannot finde them out, without some supernaturall help. As if you would choose a right jewell; (you know there are many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit ones) how should you know a true one? The stander by cannot tell, but brings it to a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidary, or a Ieweller, and he knowes it, because he is skilled in it. Now, as there are the Iewels, and they are to be discerned and differenced, but all lyes in the skill. So is it in the things that are revealed by <hi>God,</hi> and by naturall reason, to know which are of <hi>God,</hi> which not; there are the things, and they are to be seene, yea, the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves have characters, by which they may bee discerned; but let two men looke upon them, one beleeves, and the other doth not; one man
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:15479:40"/>
goes no further than reason, but the other doth; the reason is, because one is helped from above, and the other is not, he wants that light, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of skill which another hath.</p>
            <p>Now, this being premised in generall; let us see how faith gathers, that the Scriptures are true, and that all that is in them is true; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, that there is a <hi>God</hi> that made the world.<note place="margin">Three wayes, whereby Faith gathers that the Scriptures are true, and consequently, that there is a <hi>God,</hi> that made the World.</note> It gathers it by these three heads:</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> When a man lookes into the Scriptures, and  sees the phrases of the Prophets and Apostles, saying, <hi>Thus saith the Lord</hi>; he considers, if this be from <hi>God,</hi> then it must needs be true. But now the question is, whether it was delivered truly, and therefore hee lookes upon the men that did deliver it, as upon <hi>Moses,</hi> &amp;c. and if he can finde any evidence in them, that they delivered it tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without collusion, then he beleeveth that it is so, and so faith layes hold and pitches upon it; and gives solide assent unto it.</p>
            <p>Now the proofes, whereby we shew that these men have spoken by the Holy Ghost,<note place="margin">Proofes that <hi>Moses</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pen-men of Scripture, spake by the Holy Ghost.</note> are these three:</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The miracles, which they wrought: wherein  this is to be considered; that they were such mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles as were done before many witnesses,<note place="margin">The miracles which were:</note> they were not done in a corner, where two or three were,<note place="margin">1 Visible.</note> and so related to the people, as many false miracles are, but they were done before many thousand; as the standing still of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> the plagues of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the dividing of the waters, the <hi>Mannah,</hi> that came downe from Heaven, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:15479:40"/>
flowing out of the rockes, the miracles that were wrought by <hi>Eliah,</hi> and <hi>Elisha,</hi> they were all openly done, in the view of all the people.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> They were such miracles, as had a reality in them; false miracles stand onely in appearance,<note place="margin">2 Reall.</note> they have onely a shadow and not the substance, they have no solidity in them, as the miracles that Inchanters doe, they are but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as wee call them; they are onely appearances, and no more, as, if they give money, it will afterwards prove but drie leaves; and such were the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Inchanters in <hi>Aegypt</hi>: but looke upon the miracles of <hi>Moses,</hi> they were solide, as the <hi>Mannah</hi> fed the people many yeares; the water that came out of the rockes did refresh them, the plagues of <hi>Aegypt</hi> were reall; the miracles of <hi>Christ</hi> were all of use to mankinde, as when he turned water into wine, it was such as they were refreshed by; so, when hee healed the people, when he gave sight to the blinde, they were all usefull, and had a reality in them.</p>
            <p>Besides, consider the miracles which were wrought at the delivery of the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. as the thunder,<note place="margin">Exod. 19.</note> the lightning, the sound of trumpets, &amp;c. whatsoever was done then, all the people saw it, and their senses were taken up about it, so that they could not be deceived. The lawes that <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> brought from the gods, he rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, but the people saw and heard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but these miracles the people all saw, the Mount burnt with fire, and thick darknesse round about it; and there was thunder and lightning,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:15479:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the Mount trembled. And as their eyes did see <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> things, so their eares were busied.</p>
            <p>In hearing the voice of the trumpets sounding louder and louder, a great while, and hearing the voice of <hi>God</hi> himselfe. And this was not done only in the sight of the <hi>Elders of Israel,</hi> but all the people saw it, and heard the voice of the <hi>Lord.</hi> And such were all the miracles of the Apostles, and of all the Prophets. And this argues that they came from <hi>God</hi> himselfe; because they could not be done, but by a supernaturall power.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Againe, I will adde to this the prophecies,<note place="margin">The prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which were,</note> for that is one of the wayes by which the <hi>Lord</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes his word unto the sonnes of men, <hi>Isa.</hi> 41.22, 23.<note place="margin">Esay 41.22, 23.</note> 
               <hi>Shew to us the things to come, that we may know that you are Gods,</hi> &amp;c. As if hee should say; If any man be able to foretell things to come, he is <hi>God:</hi> for it is the propertie of <hi>God</hi> alone; and therefore he can doe it.</p>
            <p>Now I will name some prophecies, to instance in; and I will shew the difference betweene them, and the predictions of Southsayers; for you shall finde that these prophecies were Particular,<note place="margin">1 Particular.</note> and not generall, they were Perspicuous and plaine,<note place="margin">2 Perspicuous.</note> and not obscure, and they had fixed times set,<note place="margin">3 Limited to a set time.</note> and not left at randome: As in the prophecie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> should be strangers, and in bondage in <hi>Aegypt</hi> foure hundred yeares: now, saith the Text, that very night they went forth of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the foure hundred yeares were expired.<note place="margin">Exod. 12.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, that prophecie, that <hi>Iudah</hi> should
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:15479:41"/>
have the Scepter, it was a thing could not be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene; <hi>Iudah</hi> was not the elder brother, and it was long first before it was brought to passe: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Moses</hi> could not see it by any thing at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; and besides that, he should not only <hi>have</hi> the <hi>Scepter,</hi> but he should have it <hi>till Shiloh come,</hi> that is, CHRIST IESVS, which was about two thousand yeares after; which was not like to the prophecies of other Nations.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the prophecie of <hi>Iericho,</hi> that <hi>hee that did begin to build it againe, should lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it in his eldest sonne,</hi> and <hi>set up the gates of it</hi> in the youngest, which was fulfilled, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 16. last.<note place="margin">1 King. 16. ult.</note>
            </p>
            <p>So likewise, the prophecie of <hi>Iosiah,</hi> it was a distinct prophecie, you have it in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. where the Prophet comes from the <hi>Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King. 13.1, 2, 3.</note> and cryeth, <hi>Oh Altar, Altar, behold a childe shall bee borne, Iosiah, by name,</hi> &amp;c. he names the very man that should performe it.</p>
            <p>The like is the prophecie of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> long before <hi>Cyrus</hi> was borne, that he should deliver the <hi>Iews,</hi> and take off the yoke of their captivity, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So likewise, come to the prophecies of <hi>Daniel,</hi> the prophecie of the foure Monarchies you see, how particular it was: <hi>Daniel,</hi> he lived but in the two first, which were the <hi>Chaldean</hi> and <hi>Persian</hi> Monarchie, it was not possible, by any thing that was then done, that he should have beene able to see the succession; yet then after them was the <hi>Grecian,</hi> and then the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchie.</p>
            <p>So likewise the prophecie of the captivitie, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventie

yeares, and of their deliverance, you see, how distinct and particular it is.</p>

If you will adde to this the holinesse which appears in their writing, and of the men, as in <hi>Moses</hi>; looke upon the holinesse in his doctrine and Law: Looke upon <hi>Paul,</hi> see with what Spirit he wrote his Epistles; so consider the spirits of them all in their writings, they did, as it were, <hi>transcribere animas,</hi> they did not forbeare to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish their owne faults: see how they were hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, they suffered persecution, and in this, what end could they have? <hi>Moses</hi> sought not his owne glory, he doth not deliver the Scepter to his own Tribe, but in his prophecies he speakes worse of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:15479:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that Tribe than of any other, of <hi>Reuben, Simeon,</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> and this will confirme it, and take away all doubts of it. And this is the first proofe.</p>
            <p>The second Argument,<note place="margin">

Those Flouds that are rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Historians come so neare it, that they must needs have the relation of it from the <hi>Iewes,</hi> though they have mingled it with many falshoods, wee have not the Writings of them, but fragments in the Writings of others, as of <hi>Alexander Polyhistor,</hi> in <hi>Iosephus</hi> and <hi>Cyril:</hi> They say that there was a great Floud, and that there was one <hi>Nicurus,</hi> to whom <hi>Saturne</hi> revealed it, and bade him make an Arke; and he did so, and gathered some of all beasts into it, and that the <hi>Arke</hi> was in <hi>Armenia,</hi> and that the fragments of it are in <hi>Heliopolis.</hi> And <hi>Abidenus</hi> saith, that it was a common opinion, that the men, that the Earth brought forth, gathered themselves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and builded a great Tower, which was <hi>Babel;</hi> and the gods being angry with it, threw it down with a great wind, and thence came the confusion of tongues. And for the pillar of Salt, <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith, that some of it was remaining in his time. And for <hi>Abraham,</hi> many speake of him, and also of <hi>Moses,</hi> there are many that agree in their story of him, but the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Historians especially, and some of the ancientest <hi>Greek</hi> Historians. <hi>Diodorus
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:15479:43"/>
Siculus</hi> relates the history of him, though ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with falshoods, of what he did in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and what lawes he gave the people, and how he cast out the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and that he said he received his lawes from a <hi>God</hi> called <hi>Iah,</hi> and that they were such lawes as separated that people from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and that his <hi>God</hi> was such an one, as could not be seene, &amp;c. And <hi>Strabo</hi> saith, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> for worshipping visible gods, and therefore he was cast out, and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with him, &amp;c. After this, when <hi>Cyrus</hi> did restore the Kingdome of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Darius, Zenophon</hi> reports this, that when he came into <hi>Babylon,</hi> he gave commandement, that no <hi>Syrian</hi> should be hurt: now <hi>Syria</hi> lyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Iudea,</hi> even as one Shire doth upon another, so that they were all called <hi>Syrians.</hi> Moreover, <hi>Megasthenes,</hi> the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Historian, relates, that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had conquered <hi>Aegypt, Phoenicia,</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> and all those parts he brought into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie; and after that, hee made him a great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, which is spoken of by <hi>Daniel</hi> the Prophet, and how he ordered the people of the captivitie. Moreover, <hi>Berosus</hi> saith, that afterward hee was strucken with madnesse, and <hi>Evanuit,</hi> he vanished (for that is his word) he departed from amongst men. (Indeed one <hi>Annius,</hi> a Monke, hath put forth some books under the name of <hi>Megasthenes,</hi> but they are but supposititious.) So likewise, of <hi>Senacherib</hi> and <hi>Salmanasars</hi> warre, and of the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple, they are recorded in the <hi>Annals</hi> of the <hi>Tyrians.</hi> This is related by

those that are neither <hi>Iewes</hi> nor <hi>Christians</hi>; and these testimonies are fetched from those that are our enemies, which are more fit for the Presse, than for the Pulpit, and to be written, than deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in a popular congregation.</p>
            <p>I will adde to this but this one; consider the exact Chronologie, which is found in all the Scriptures,<note place="margin">The exact Chronologie in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> and the agreement of them with the Heathen Histories.</p>
            <p>In latter times there have beene great confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but the greatest evidence, that is to be found, is the Tables of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> lately found, which doth exactly agree with the Scripture; he exactly sets downe the time that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> reigned; compare them with the Scripture, and you shall finde these agree with <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi> otherwise Chronologers differ very much: for in <hi>Ioseph Scaligers</hi> time, that Table they had not, but it was found since: So in the time when <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was taken, they agree exactly; and this is the greatest testimony that the Scripture can have from Heathen men.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:15479:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>But yet we will adde something to it, because the <hi>Papists</hi> have abused this, and say, they would have the truth of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to depend upon the authority of the <hi>Church,</hi> and not so much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the testimony it hath received from all ages and generations; they would have it to be such a testimony as the present Church gives of it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, say they, that can erre in nothing; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not in this: and therefore they say, This is the Bible, and the very Dictate of the <hi>Pope, in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrâ,</hi> with his Councell (some say,) makes it so, and you must receive it for Scripture, upon this ground, without any further inquiry. But, with us, who doe not receive that conclusion, that the Church cannot erre; it is out of questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Scripture doth not depend on the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Church.</p>
            <p>But yet we will give you this reason against it. Aske that <hi>Church,</hi> that Synod of men, what is that which makes the <hi>Church</hi> to beleeve that the Scripture is the Word of <hi>God?</hi> Surely, they will give the same answer, that we shall deliver vnto you; that it could be nothing else, but the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it selfe, which therefore must needs be of greater authoritie than the <hi>Church</hi> it selfe, for the declaration of themselves, and the Scriptures ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of this argument, be of more force than the authority of the Church, as the cause hath much more strength, than the effect. Againe, the Church hath no authoritie to judge of the Scripture, till it be knowne to be the Church, which cannot be but by the Scripture. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:15479:46"/>
the Scripture hath a testimony more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, than the authoritie of the Church, and therefore cannot receive its authoritie from any; the Scripture being the first truth, it cannot be proved by any other; it is the confession of their owne Writers, that <hi>Theologia non est argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiva</hi>; Theologie is not argumentative, to prove its owne principles, but only our deductions out of it: As also, they say, we cannot prove the Scriptures, <hi>probando, sed solvendo,</hi> by answering, and resolving objections made against it. In all other things, you see, it is so; as the Standard, that being the rule of all, cannot be knowne but by it selfe; the Sunne that shewes light to all things else, cannot be knowne by any other light but its owne: so the Scripture, that is the ground of all other truths, cannot be knowne, but by the evidence of those truths, that it carries in it selfe.</p>
            <p>We have onely this word to be added more concerning the Scriptures. You shall observe this difference betweene the Writings of the Scripture, that were written by holy men inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Holy Ghost,<note place="margin">A difference betweene the Writings of the Pen-men of Scripture, and other holy men.</note> and all mens Writings in the world.

Paul,</hi> and all the Worthies in the Scripture, you shall finde nothing given to them: But of <hi>David,</hi> it is said, that he <hi>walked wisely,</hi> because the LORD <hi>was with him,</hi> it was not his owne strength; so, when they had any victory, it was not through their owne courage, or stratagems, that they used, but the LORD did give their enemies into their hands. And <hi>Paul,</hi> that was the meanes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting so many thousands, he ascribes nothing to himselfe, but it was the <hi>grace of</hi> GOD, that was with him. So, <hi>Samson</hi> was strong, but yet he had his strength from <hi>God</hi>; and therefore this is an argument, that the Scriptures were written by holy men inspired by the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:15479:48"/>
weakly beleeved; so have they more or lesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence into the hearts and lives of men. As take a man that beleeves fully, that <hi>there is a</hi> GOD; and that, <hi>the Scriptures are his Word:</hi> this breeds an unresistable resolution to serve, and please him, notwithstanding all oppositions he meets with: Take the greatest things that use to daunt men, as take a man that is to die, if he considers that there is a <hi>God,</hi> with whom he is to live for ever, what is death then? no more than the stones flying about <hi>Stevens</hi> eares, when he beheld the heavens opened; so when men speake against him, and slander him; when they scoffe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile him, and trample upon him; yet, if <hi>God</hi> be with him, he can boldly say, <hi>I care not for mans day,</hi> nor for the <hi>speaking against of sinners</hi>; he is not moved a whit with them; they passe away as a vapour, that moves him not: so when hee sees the current of the times to runne against him, yet, when he sees that there is an <hi>Almightie</hi> GOD that takes notice of him, he is able to stand against and despise them all, and is not stirred an haires breadth out of the way for it, they are as waters beating against a rocke. Consider the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> that died in the fire, if you had stood by, you would have said; Surely, that man hath a strong faith, that can goe out of this life, and suffer such a kinde of death; but why doth he doe it? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he beleeves that there is a GOD,<note place="margin">Hebr. 11.6.</note> 
               <hi>that is a rewarder of them that seeke him.</hi> So every regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man, whatsoever he doth, he doth it with the same faith that they did, only here is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:15479:49"/>
the Martyrs spent all at once, and these doe it but drop by drop: as when a man for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beares all present joyes, which this life consists in; it is, as it were, a dying by peece-meales, a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drop by drop, as <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>I dye daily.</hi> If one of us were to suffer, as the <hi>Martyrs</hi> did, what is it that would establish our soules? it is the beleefe of these principles, that inables the <hi>Saints</hi> to doe all this: you live by your faith in these princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, though you observe it not; for this is a thing that is to be marked to this purpose, that the opinions of men, their imaginations and thoughts, they all proceed from such notions, as lye more overly in their hearts, but their actions proceed from the strong setled notions and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that are riveted in their inward heart. And therefore, observe the lives of men; such as their principles in them are, such are their actions: For as it is true, on the one side, where men beleeve, there they come to <hi>God</hi>; so it is true on the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, if men be not grounded in these first princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, if they doe not beleeve, they doe not come to him; but goe on unevenly in their wayes, and forsake their profession.</p>
            <p>Now, whence comes this uneven walking, this exorbitance of the wheeles, but from the weaknesse of the maine spring, that sets all on mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? because these are the first springs, that set all the rest on worke. For, could a man be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away by the praise of men, by the voice and breath of man, on the one side; or could he be discouraged by the scoffes of men on the other
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:15479:49"/>

Hence it is, (although you doe not observe from whence it comes) yet hence doe come all those fruits of Atheisme in the lives of men; all that unthankfulnesse, that men can take blessings at GODS hands, and never give him thankes, nay rather, they render evill for good; hence it is, that men trust in meanes more than in <hi>God</hi>; hence it is, that men are so unholy when they come into his presence, they are not strucke with feare and reverence of his Majestie, when they come before him; hence also comes that care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessenesse in the lives of men that feare not his Word, but walke on in a carelesse and remisse manner; and hence also is that hasting after ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and profits, with the neglect of better things; they all arise from hence, even the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the assent to these maine principles: for there is a double kinde of <hi>Atheisme</hi> in the heart; there is a direct thought of Atheisme, when a man doubts of the truth of these principles, and knows he doth so. Secondly, when a man doubts, and knowes not that he doubts.</p>

            <p>But it is not onely a ground of all this, but it brings forth the effect: it doth exceedingly strengthen our faith in matters of justification; for it is certaine, that the same faith, whereby we beleeve, and apply the promises of salvation, through <hi>Christ,</hi> it is the same faith whereby we

beleeve the Scripture, and that there is a <hi>God,</hi> that made both Heaven and Earth.

Now come to a beleever going out of the world, and aske him what hope hee hath to be saved, and what ground for it? he will be ready to say, I know that <hi>Christ</hi> is come into the world, and that he is offered, and I know that I am one of them that have a part in him; I know that I have fulfilled the conditions, as that I should not continue wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly in any knowne sinne, that I should love the LORD IESVS, and desire to serve him above all; I know that I have fulfilled these conditions. I say, if the ground whereon our faith is builded be the Word, then it is builded on a sure rocke, and the gates of hell, Satan, and all his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions shall not prevaile against it, but against a strong fancie it may.</p>

Our nature is as prone to Idolatry as any, though not in that kind: for man is a weake creature, and therefore hee seekes something to repose himselfe upon; and because they finde not any one thing sufficient; therefore they put their confidence in many, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> For all Idolatry is upon one of these three grounds:</p>
            <p n="1">1 They worship them for gods,<note place="margin">Three grounds of Idolatrie.</note> whom they saw excellent men, that had something in them above themselves; such as were strong men, as <hi>Hercules</hi>; and those that were Law-givers, and Princes, as <hi>Saturne,</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi>; and they did worship Vertues likewise; and they did build a Temple to <hi>Vertue</hi> it selfe; and to <hi>Iustice,</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</hi>

Now, for the worshipping the creatures; we are not to doe it: there is no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the world that can do either good or hurt, as it was said of Idols. But when our affections are so inordinately carried to them, we set them up for gods, though we observe it not. It is <hi>Gods</hi> prerogative royall, and it belongs only to him, to doe good or evill; whatsoever is either good or evill, he is the Author of it; he makes mens lives comfortable, or uncomfortable, at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; for hee disposeth of things, giving them, and taking them from whom he will. Therefore, why is he forgotten? and why doe men joyne other things with him? so farre, as men see not the vanity of all things, and so farre, as their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are taken up with these outward things, so much Idolatry there is in their hearts.

            </p>
            <p>But we will first speake of the Deitie, then of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>God</hi> is knowne to us two wayes:
<list>
                  <item>1 By his Essence; and</item>
                  <item>2 By his Attributes.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Now the great question is, what this Essence of <hi>God</hi> is.<note place="margin">What the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of <hi>God</hi> is.</note> Beloved, you need more than the tongue of man to declare this to you; yet we will shew it to you, as the Scripture reveales it.</p>
            <p>Now, if we should define it, (though it is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable properly of no definition) wee would say, GOD <hi>is an incomprehensible, first, and absolute Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> These words in this place, set out the Essence of <hi>God</hi> most clearely of any place in Scripture, that I know. This is the first expression, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>God</hi> did ever shew himselfe in his Essence. <hi>God</hi> hath before made himselfe knowne by his <hi>All-sufficiencie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 6.3.</note> Chap. 6.3. <hi>I appeared to Abraham; to Isaac, and unto Iacob, by the name of</hi> GOD <hi>Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but by my name</hi> IEHOVAH, <hi>was I not knowne
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:15479:63"/>
unto them.</hi> This name, IEHOVAH, was knowne to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as appeares in divers places; but the meaning is, it was not opened to them, they did not understand it: The <hi>Lord</hi> saith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1.<note place="margin">Gen. 17.1.</note> 
               <hi>I am the Almightie</hi> GOD, <hi>walke before mee, and be thou perfect.</hi> You shall finde that Name used on every occasion, by <hi>Abraham,</hi> by <hi>Isaac,</hi> and by <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob. El-shaddai</hi>; GOD <hi>all-sufficient</hi>; but not IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOVAH. The first time that ever <hi>God</hi> made himselfe knowne by this name, was here to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, I am that I am.</hi> There are two things to be observed in this expression:</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The incomprehensiblenesse of <hi>Almighty</hi> GOD, as it is usually said by us; when wee are asked a thing, that we will not reveale any further, or that we would not have another to prie any further into, we say, It is, what it is; so <hi>God</hi> saith to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, I am, what I am.</hi>
               <note place="margin">What is meant by such aforme of expression <hi>I am what I am.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Such a kinde of speech is also used to shew the immutabilitie of a thing; as <hi>Pilat</hi> said, <hi>What I have written, I have written</hi>; I will not change it: so men use to say; I have done what I have done, to shew the constancie of a thing, that it shall not be altered: therefore, when <hi>God</hi> would shew the constancie of his Nature, he addes further, <hi>I am,</hi> without any other word: as if hee should say; <hi>Moses,</hi> if they inquire of thee, what my name is, tell them only this; <hi>Hee is,</hi> hath sent me unto you; as the <hi>Septuagints</hi> translate it,<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; that is, if I should deliver the most expressing name, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I would be knowne to all ages, this is that which I will pitch upon; <hi>I am,</hi> or IEHOVAH;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:15479:64"/>
which comes from the same root. And if <hi>Moses</hi> should yet further inquire of his Name, he leads him into a further expression: <hi>The</hi> LORD GOD <hi>of your Fathers, the</hi> GOD <hi>of Abraham, the</hi> GOD <hi>of Isaac, and the</hi> GOD <hi>of Iacob hath sent me unto you; this is my Name for ever, and this is my memoriall unto all generations.</hi> As if he should say; If yet they cannot understand what this Name is, it is the same that I was knowne by to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Isaac,</hi> and to <hi>Iacob</hi>; what I was to them, the same will I be to you. I was knowne to them by my Word, and by my workes, and by my miracles, and the same shall you finde me, it is that <hi>God</hi> which hath sent me unto you. <hi>This is my Name</hi>; which words are to be referred, not onely to the latter words, but to the former, <hi>I am, that I am.</hi> The words in the originall are in the future tense; yet it is fitly translated, <hi>I am</hi>; for the future tense in <hi>Hebrew</hi> is often put for the present tense; and the words are put in the future tense, to shew his immutabilitie; which translation <hi>Christs</hi> words doe warrant; <hi>Before Abraham was, I am:</hi> therefore the <hi>Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gints</hi> do well translate it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, signifying no more, but he which is; so that, that which we are to learne from hence is this; <hi>That I am,</hi> or <hi>Iehovah, I am, that I am,</hi> is the proper and essentiall name of <hi>God,</hi> (all <hi>Divines</hi> agree in this, I know none hat differ) because it expresseth him in his Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, without any limitation, or modification. Besides, you shall finde, that this name is never attributed to any other. The <hi>Altar,</hi> indeed, was called <hi>Iehovah</hi>; but the meaning was; <hi>to Iehovah</hi>;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:15479:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his other names indeed are given to the creatures, but this is given only to him: Whence I gather this point:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That to be, or to say this,</hi> He is, <hi>or</hi> I am,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>It is common to no creature with him; you cannot say of any creature, <hi>It is</hi>; if it be the only property of <hi>God</hi> to be, then you must say of every creature, <hi>It is not</hi>; and onely the <hi>Lord is</hi>; which is a strange speech, but yet it is true, or else it is not proper to <hi>God</hi> only.</p>

you, as it is, they are lesse than that which you reckon as nothing; as you doe a dust of the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance; so that in respect of the largenesse of his being, they are nothing to him: there are divers degrees, and extents of being, and he hath them all in him; as, there is a being of <hi>Angels,</hi> another of men, and so of every creature; but they are defined, and you know that definitions doe but limit the being of a thing.

Consider that he who is the <hi>Lord</hi> of being, is able to make up these wants: so if our complaints be for our selves, they all come from some wants; but know that he who is the <hi>Almightie God,</hi> that makes all things to be, he can give thee constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, he can enable thee to do all things, and <hi>streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the weake hands and feeble knees, Hebr.</hi> 22.

the Sea of water, thinke with thy selfe that hee alone is able to give being to every grace, and to make up every defect, and give that to thee which thou hast not, and to all whom thou hast to doe with, as thy wife, children, friends, &amp;c. he can make things that were bad, good and usefull, and so make thy friend good also, as he did <hi>Onesimus</hi> for <hi>Paul</hi>; thinke with thy selfe that the <hi>Lord</hi> of strength can doe it, and he only can doe it: here every creature is at a stand to make a being; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore goe to him, and give him the praise and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Name.</p>
            <p>And as it should move us to doe this in our wants; so it should helpe thee in all those great crosses that afflict thee: For every crosse is in that <hi>which is not</hi>; as <hi>Rachel wept of her children that were not:</hi> You shall see in <hi>Abraham, he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in</hi> GOD, even in GOD, <hi>who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not, as though they were Rom.</hi> 4.17.<note place="margin">Rom. 4.17.</note> This was <hi>Abrahams</hi> case, he was to lose his sonne, for ought that he knew, yet he comforted himselfe in this, that <hi>Iehovah,</hi> the mightie <hi>God,</hi> that is the <hi>Lord</hi> of being, he that calleth things that are not, as if they were, hee could either give him his owne sonne againe, or one that was as good as he. Thus he did comfort himselfe; and so may we upon all occasions: <hi>God</hi> can make things to be that are not. Take <hi>Iob,</hi> when his houses, his children, estate, all were gone, and all were not, yet <hi>Iehovah,</hi> he that makes things that are not, did not he make all things to returne againe? So <hi>David,</hi> when things were not,

when his Kingdome was not, when his good name was gone, as wee see by <hi>Shimei's</hi> cursing, what a name he had, yet <hi>God</hi> did make all to come againe. <hi>Naomi,</hi> when all was gone, her husband and her sonnes gone, and they were not, yet hee that was the <hi>Lord</hi> of being gave her a sonne, and a daughter, that brought her in more comfort that her owne sonnes would. And this is the use that I would have you to make of it.</p>
            <p>When thou hast lost any thing, when thy sons or thy goods are gone, he can make up all: Hee who could make up the absence of <hi>Christ</hi> to the Disciples, as he did by his Spirit, so that it was better with them than before, they had more comfort and knowledge, and could doe greater miracles, that <hi>God</hi> can surely make good any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther losse the most pinching.

your images doe bring things to passe, for then they should be called <hi>Iehovah,</hi> which is proper alone to me, to bring any thing to passe.</p>
            <p>So a man may apply it to any thing else; if a man shall say, that his owne wit, or worth, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie, &amp;c. doth bring things to passe; he takes that praise which peculiarly belongs to <hi>God,</hi> and gives it to the creature; whereas the <hi>Lord</hi> sayes, <hi>Iehovah</hi> is my name, and there is not the least thing, but I bring it to passe.

               <hi>Lord thou wilt ordaine peace for us, for thou also hast wrought all our workes in us.</hi> The scope of this place is this: Other men (saith he) they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get <hi>God,</hi> they carry themselves aloft, but it is hee that will ordaine us peace, though none else shall put his hand to it; it is he that doth <hi>all</hi> our works for us, not our especiall workes only, but all; it is
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:15479:73"/>
not any man, or any creature that doth them, it is he that workes all our workes for us. And if we did beleeve this, we should looke upon him with another eye, and serve him after another manner; we should be more dependent on him, we should be more fervent in prayer; &amp; not when we would doe any thing, turne every stone, and to knocke at every creatures doore, to see what helpe they could give us; but our eye would bee towards him; for it is in vaine to runne to them; no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can doe it, there is no enterprise but hath many wheeles, and the stopping of one wheele hinders the whole enterprise; and it is hee, that turnes all those wheeles, commands all, must bring it to passe, or else the least thing will hinder our greatest enterprises; therefore you see that the fairest blossomes of our endevours doe often wither, and the unprobablest things doe come to passe. See it in <hi>David,</hi> to give you an example of it; when he would trust <hi>God,</hi> he had a promise of the Kingdome, but not by himselfe; his owne power should not doe it; and yet the wheeles of <hi>Gods</hi> providence did bring it to passe. So when he staid his hand from killing <hi>Nabal,</hi> did not the <hi>Lord</hi> bring it to passe in a better manner than hee could have done? And when he had the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <hi>Abner</hi> was his great enemie, but yet <hi>David</hi> did nothing, but that which was right; and you see how <hi>God</hi> did bring it to passe, he tooke away his life without any hand of his. So <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> was his enemie, yet when <hi>David</hi> sate still, and did nothing, his head was brought to him;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:15479:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(though they that did it, did it wickedly) yet it was an act of <hi>Gods</hi> providence to him. Thus things are done for the best, when wee commit them to him; but if we doe them our selves, wee are as they that <hi>fished all the night long, and caught nothing,</hi> till <hi>Christ</hi> came, and bade them to cast in the net, then they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: So it is with us, when we goe about any enterprise, it is in vaine, we are not able to doe it. There is a double going about any enterprise; when we goe about an enterprise without <hi>God,</hi> and when we goe about it with him. When wee goe about it without <hi>God,</hi> I confesse, that yet some things are brought to passe; and that will serve to answer an objection which you have ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expressed in <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.7.<note place="margin">Psal. 37.7.</note>

If you looke to the rocke, to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; from whence they were hewen, and to the hole of the pit, from whence they were digged, they were made of nothing, and are readie to returne to nothing. Take a glasse, or an earthen vessell, they are brittle; if you aske the reason, they are made of brittle ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials: plate is not so; so that this is the reason of all the vanitie under the Sunne, because they are made of nothing. Therefore there is no way to remedie this, but to looke up to <hi>God, Act.</hi> 17.28.<note place="margin">Act. 17.28.</note> 
               <hi>For in him we live, move, and have our being.</hi> This is the meaning of it. They have not onely had their being from him at the first, but their be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing is in him. We have our being in him, as the beames in the Sunne, and an accident in the subject.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Consider this for matter of grace. When thou hast got any good desires, or good purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, at any time, remember that the being of them comes from <hi>God.</hi> Hence it comes to passe, that good purposes oft-times doe come to nothing, and like sparkes goe out againe; because we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not that they are from <hi>God</hi>; wee thinke that if wee have good purposes to day, if wee be spiritually minded to day, we shall be so to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow; and thus you deceive your selves, you must consider that the being of them comes from <hi>God:</hi> that place is remarkeable, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.18. when <hi>David</hi> had rejoyced that the people had offered willingly,<note place="margin">1 Chro. 29.18.</note> he prayes that GOD <hi>would keepe it in the imagination of the thoughts of their hearts:</hi> If we would thus hang upon him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on him, when the Spirit hath breathed in us at any time, when we have any sparks of truth, and are warmed with any holy affections, if we would give him the glory of this, that he gives a being, if we would make this prayer that <hi>David</hi> doth, you would finde it a meanes to make you more equall, and more even in grace. And what I say of this, I say of all other things. It is the fault of us all, we are subject to the which is said of wicked men, <hi>Isai.</hi> 56.12.<note place="margin">Isai. 56.12.</note> 
               <hi>Come yee</hi> (say they) <hi>I will fetch wine, and we will fill our selves with strong

drinke, and to morrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, whence comes this? let a man have health to day, he thinkes he shall have it to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; let him have peace and friends to day, hee thinkes it will be so still. This is every mans thought; and it ariseth from hence, that we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get <hi>Iehovah,</hi> he that continues the being of every thing. If we did remember this, we should say; I doe not know whether it be his pleasure that gives being to them: I know, that if he withdraw his hand, they will come to nothing. It is a great fault to boast of to morrow; hereby you detract from <hi>God,</hi> and dishonour him exceedingly, you see how he complains of it, <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.13, 14. you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon his royall prerogatives.<note place="margin">Iames 4.13, 14.</note> It is, as if a man should challenge many 100. acres of ground, and hath not one foot; for future times are properly the <hi>Lords.</hi> Now, when we will anticipate things in our thoughts, and rejoyce in our projects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, as if they were come to passe; this is a sinfull rejoycing. And thence it is, that pride goes before a fall; because that when a man begins to lift himselfe upon a creature, and to build upon that which is but vanity, then the <hi>Lord</hi> begins to take away our foundation, and hinder our purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and then he falls and perisheth. Why doest thou boast of to morrow? Knowest thou what is in the wombe of the day? thou knowest no more, than they know, what is in the wombe of a woman, till they see it.</p>
            <p>Now, <hi>God</hi> hath an over-ruling hand in all
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:15479:75"/>
these, and therefore he doth disappoint us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause wee are readie to give to the creature that which belongs to himselfe; therefore, if thou wouldest have any thing to continue, depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, because all things else are subject to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and he only gives being, and continuance to them all.</p>

                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1.</note>He is without all cause: for, if there were any cause of him, that cause must needs be caused,

either from some other, or from it selfe, not from any other; for then there should be something that is before the <hi>Lord,</hi> that is better than he, from whom he receives all things; but that cannot be: for, then it should be <hi>God,</hi> and not the <hi>Lord</hi>; and it is not from it selfe, because nothing is the cause of it selfe, for then it should be before it selfe, and it should be better than it selfe; for the cause, though it give the same that is in it selfe, to the effect, as the father to the sonne; yet the cause is better, because that which gives, is better than that which receives.</p>
               <p>Againe, it should be different from it selfe, for the cause is different from the effect: therefore it must needs be, that he is without all cause, and the first, and the beginning of all the creatures of <hi>God.</hi>

fountaine, that hath water originally, hath not the part, but the whole, though afterwards it runnes into many brookes; and if there were but one fountaine, as there is but one Sunne, then all the water would be in that fountaine, as the light is in the Sunne.</p>
               <p>Now to apply this, looke upon all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and you shal find that they have all but part of being; the Angels have one part, men another, and other creatures another part, &amp;c. which is an argument that there is a whole, which is GOD <hi>blessed for ever.</hi>

               <p>Besides, it argues that he hath that wholenesse of being from himselfe; for he that hath but part of a thing, doth borrow it, and therefore must come to the originall; for nothing is borrowed but it is from another, and not from it selfe; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, seeing the creatures have but a part of being, it presupposeth that there is a whole, that there is an immense being, that is of himselfe, and from himselfe, and hath it not from any creature.</p>

Looke whatsoever is in the creature, what justice or excellencie, it comes from <hi>God</hi>; and if he should will any thing for this cause; because it is good, there should be a reciprocation, which is impossible.

erre: that which goes by a rule, though it doth not swarve, yet it may; but if it be the rule it selfe, it is impossible to erre.

The <hi>Angels</hi> and creatures have a rule, and therefore may erre; but it is not so with <hi>God,</hi> and therefore what <hi>God</hi> wils is just, because he is the rule it selfe; therefore in the mysteries of predestination, we are to say thus with our selves; Thus I finde the <hi>Lord</hi> hath set it downe, thus he hath expressed himselfe in his Word, such is his pleasure; and therefore it is reason, and just such against which there can be no exception.</p>

So <hi>God,</hi> because hee is the first cause, hee may have what end he will, and no man can say, why doest thou so? hee may make some vessels of honour, and some of dishonour, and all for himselfe, and his owne glory: therefore, when you see that he did not spare the Angels, but cast them downe into hell, there to be reserved in chaines of darknesse till the last day; when you see him not sparing the old world, when you see him suffering the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to walke in their owne wayes; when you see him to suffer a great part of the world to be damned, and to perish; when you see him let the Churches to be made havocke of, you should be ready to say thus, <hi>To him be glory for ever:</hi> that is, you should not murmure against him, but glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him, and reverence him for ever: for he may

You see it is so with men, as a knife is made to cut, a key to open, &amp;c. and yet they are all of one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall: so the <hi>Lord</hi> looking downe from heaven, he made of one heape of clay severall creatures, and appointed to every one his several end, which end they must observe and aime at; and if they doe not, they wrong him that made them; and therefore it is hee destroyes them. And so it is with every thing that is made for an end; as fire,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:15479:89"/>
that is made to warme a man, if it doe burne the house, we put it out; a vessell that is made to keep wine or beare, if it doe corrupt it, we lay it aside, and put it into one more wholesome: so doth <hi>God,</hi> he puts to every man his severall end, and therefore he gives them severall gifts, and severall callings: himselfe, indeed, is the generall end, but besides the generall, he appoints to every calling a particular end; to a Minister he saith, Goe, and feed my sheepe; if he goes, and feeds himselfe, and not the people; if he feed them with stubble, and not with hay, hee doth not attaine his end; and so may I say of every thing else; of a schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, a Magistrate, a husband; they have severall places, and divers gifts given them, and all for their severall end, and if they aime not at their end, but worke for themselves, they are worthy to be destroyed: as a man, if hee hath an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is crooked, and unfit for use, then hee casts it away, and taketh another; but if it be fit, he will lay it up for use, and he will say, let it not be lost: so doth the <hi>Lord</hi> with men, if they be pliable to him, if they will worke for the end that he hath appointed them, then he saves and preserves them; but if they will doe things for their owne end, it is the next way to destruction.</p>
               <p>For observe this; for any man to do any thing for his owne end, is to arrogate that to himselfe, which is the <hi>Lords,</hi> who is without cause, which is an high kinde of idolatry. Let them consider this therefore, that labour that they may be rich, that labour that they might have outward excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:15479:90"/>
and to be something in the flesh, that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour only for outward honour, for places of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and credit in all things; so a scholler that is negligent, he saith, I shall make a shift to live; but hast thou not another end? art thou not made? art thou not a creature? is it enough for thee to live, and no more? so they that have their estates provided for them, they care not for lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they say, they can live without it; but art not thou made? and is not this thine end, to serve <hi>God</hi> and men? So he that shall choose a calling or course of life, according to his owne fancie, not that which shall be serviceable to men, but that which pleaseth himselfe, let him aske himselfe this question; Am I not made? Am I not a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? have I no other end, but my selfe? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let men consider this, and looke to it; have I not chosen this course of life, and have I not an end appointed to me? That end is to be service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to <hi>God,</hi> and profit men: But if a man shall thinke with himselfe, what is the best way to live and provide for my selfe, and to get profit and wealth; these are idolatrous and sinful thoughts. <hi>God</hi> may doe all things for himselfe, because he hath nothing above himselfe; <label type="milestone">

               <p>Thou that doest pretend this, that thou doest things to be serviceable to <hi>God</hi> and men, and not to thy selfe, thou shalt know it by this:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1 If thou puttest thy selfe to things that are
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:15479:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>
above thee, it is a signe that thou doest it not for his sake, that hath appointed thee, but for thine owne.</p>
               <p n="2">2 If thou art fit for an higher place, if thou restest in things that are beneath thee, for thy greater profit, thou seekest thy selfe, and not the <hi>Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 If thou doest resist the providence of <hi>God,</hi> that when thou hast a calling, and art put in it, and thou puttest thy selfe out again for thy advantage, then thine end is thine owne selfe. <hi>Paul</hi> when he went to <hi>Macedonia,</hi> hee found but bad entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there, yet he went, because he was sent. So <hi>Iohn,</hi> he went to <hi>Pathmos,</hi> where the people were but few, and barbarous, yet he obeyed <hi>God,</hi> and went. <hi>Eliah,</hi> when he was sent to <hi>Ahab,</hi> and to prophesie to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> among whom, for all that hee knew, there was not one soule, that did not bow his knee to <hi>Baal. Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>Isaiah,</hi> when they went to harden the people to destruction, yet they went willingly, because the <hi>Lord</hi> sent them; it was an argument that they did it not for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. A servant is not to doe his owne worke, he doth it as his master will have him to doe it; if he doth the things that his master bids him, and saith, I am his servant; and if he bid me to goe, I will goe, or if he bid me come, I will come; if he bid me to keepe within doore, and to doe the meanest works, I will doe them; this is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he doth not seeke himselfe. When a man is thus dependent upon <hi>God,</hi> willing to take imployment, not above him, nor below him, nor
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:15479:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
resist his providence, but willing to be guided by him, it is a signe that he seekes the <hi>Lord,</hi> and not himselfe.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Besides, let a man consider what he doth in these services that immediatly concerne the <hi>Lord</hi> himselfe. If a man shall study much, and pray lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; if a man shall spend all his time in his calling about worldly businesse, and little time for duties to build up himselfe in knowledge, as in prayer and reading, &amp;c. it is a signe that he doth it, not for the <hi>Lord,</hi> but for himselfe; for he that seekes not the <hi>Lord,</hi> in that which is done to his person, he doth it not in that which is done in outward workes; he that will not be faithfull in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that which <hi>God</hi> doth immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in his worship, he will never be faithfull in those things which are further off, that are of lesse consequence, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.4.<note place="margin">Acts 6.4.</note> It was an argument they gave themselves in integrity, to the ministry of the Word, because they gave themselves to prayer as well as it; they did, as it were, divide the time between both; if we were to preach on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, say the Apostles, we could then wait upon Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, but one halfe of our time is to be taken up in prayer, the other in preaching: and if you thus divide the time, it is a signe you look to the <hi>Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 Besides, consider what it is that troubles thee? what a man aimes at, if he lose his end, that grieves him, when his worke is done; if this be thy trouble that thou hast lost some credit, or profit, then thine end is thy selfe; but if this be thy griefe, that thou hast not done it in such m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:15479:91"/>
that others may receive profit and advantage by it, it is a signe that thou diddest it not for thy selfe, but for <hi>Gods</hi> glory.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Besides, if a man considers what it is that doth make things pleasant, and gives amabilitie to that, which is harsh in it selfe. Labour in it selfe is sweet to no man, unlesse there be something in it that sweetens it: now consider what that is, if in it thy eye is upon thy wealth, that comes by it; if thou studiest hard, and if thou preachest much, and it is for the praise of men, thou seekest thy selfe, and thy reward is in it; but if thou lookest up to the <hi>Lord,</hi> if thou doest it, because he sees it, and knowes it, and that he may say; <hi>I know thy worke and thy labour</hi>; it is a signe that thy end in it, was the <hi>Lord,</hi> and not thy selfe.</p>
               <p n="7">7 From whence doest thou looke for wages? from <hi>God</hi> or from men? Whence come those complaints of the unthankfulnesse of friends and pupils, and those we doe good to? but because we looke to men, and not to <hi>God.</hi> For if we did looke to <hi>God</hi> for our reward, their thankfulnesse or unthankfulnesse would be of small moment to us: for doth the Nurse nurse the childe for it own sake only? doth shee looke for reward from the child, or from the mother that putteth it to nurse; if you look for your reward from men; they are your end; but if you looke for it from the <hi>Lord,</hi> their encouragements or discouragements will not much move you.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Againe, consider wherin thy minde resteth, for that which a man makes his end, therein his
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:15479:92"/>
minde resteth, and in nothing besides: a husband-man, though he doth plow and sow, &amp;c. yet he rests not til he comes to the harvest: he that hews stone, and squares timber, doth it, and stayes not till the house be built: therefore, doe thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider with thy selfe, in all thy workes, what it is that gives rest to thy thoughts; if thou doest say, I have now wealth and riches enough, and means enough, I have gotten what I aimed at, and now my soule is at rest; if thou sayest, I have now ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and name enough, my children be well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for; and therefore your soule rest in this; then this was your end, and not the <hi>Lord</hi>; wheras you ought to say, though I have provided for my children, yet doe they feare the <hi>Lord?</hi> are they brought home to him? My trade hath brought me home much, but how serviceable have I been with it? I have much credit and estate, but what glory hath it brought to IESVS CHRIST? So he that is a Minister; it is true, I have enough, enough credit, enough for estate; but what is this? have I brought any glory to the <hi>Lord?</hi> have I converted any? if thy heart can have no rest, but in the <hi>Lord,</hi> and in the things that belong to the <hi>Lord,</hi> it is an argument that thine eye was upon him.</p>
               <p>Remember this, that seeing we are made, seeing we have an higher cause, and that to be without cause belongs to <hi>God</hi> alone; therefore wee must carry our selves as creatures; as it is said of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, he served his time</hi>; hee did nothing for his owne end, but he carried himselfe as a servant, he
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:15479:92"/>
did not say; I will have so much pleasure, and then serve <hi>God</hi>; he did not cut the <hi>Lord</hi> short, but he served his time, he gave the <hi>Lord</hi> the whole day. It was the comfort that IESVS CHRIST had, when he was to goe out of the world, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.4.<note place="margin">Ioh. 17.4.</note> 
                  <hi>I have glorified thee on earth, I have finished the worke that thou gavest me to doe</hi>; that is, I was as a servant, and I chose not my worke, but it is that which thou gavest me, and I have not done it by halfes, but I have finished it; therefore glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie thou me. So, if thou canst say it, when thou goest out of the world, that will be thy comfort at that day; but if not, remember that it is the <hi>Lords</hi> manner of dealing, when men will seeke themselves, and their owne end; he layes them aside, as we doe broken vessels, fit for no more use, and he takes another. If there be any here, that can say so, that the <hi>Lord</hi> hath laid thee aside, and taken thy gifts from thee; remember, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with thy selfe, that hadst thou used them to his glory, and made him thy end, be sure that he would not have laid thee aside, but that he would have used thee. Beloved, we see it by experience, that men of small parts, yet if they had humble hearts, and did use them in the simplicitie of their spirits to <hi>Gods</hi> glory, then he hath enlarged them, and used them in greatest imployments. Againe, on the contrary side; men of excellent parts, they have withered, because they did not use them to <hi>Gods</hi> glory, therefore he hath layd them aside as broken vessels.</p>

                  <hi>To the King eternall, immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, invisible, and only wise</hi> GOD, <hi>be honour and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:15479:97"/>
glory for ever.</hi> And as he is an eternall King, so he hath given to us, his subjects, to be eternall, as the soule is; and he hath given punishments, and rewards eternall; hell is an everlasting prison, and heaven is an eternall Palace; therefore these are the things most to be regarded of us. And if wee would but throughly consider that these things are eternall, it would effectually draw our mindes to the things that are above. A man that comes to an Inne, if he can get a better roome, he will; if not, hee can be content with it, for hee saith, it is but for a night; so your habitation here is but for a night: if you can have a better condition, <hi>use it rather,</hi> but if not, be not much moved, for it is but for a night. In worldly things the shortnesse of them makes us to undergoe them cheerefully. An apprentiship that is hard, a man will indure it, for hee saith it is but for a time; so things that are pleasant, if they be but of short continuance, wee regard them the lesse. Now our time that we have here, in respect of eternity, is shorter than an apprentiship, nay, than a night, nay, shorter than an houre. Now put the case, that a man should have an houre given him; and it should be said to him; as thou spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest this houre, so thou shalt live all thy dayes; what would not a man doe, or what would he not suffer? how carefull would he be to spend this houre well? Now this life is not so much as an houre to eternitie; and therefore why should we not be carefull how we spend this houre, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it shall be with us for ever according as wee
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:15479:97"/>
spend it? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.25.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.25.</note> 
                  <hi>Every one that striveth for the mastery is temperate; now they doe it to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a corruptible crowne, but we an incorruptible.</hi> Thus he reasoneth, If men that use these <hi>Olympi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> gaines, if they will endure so much hardship and abstinence, accustome their bodies to heat and cold for the race before-hand, and doe all but for a crowne, that will last but this life at the most; and shall not we (saith he) for an incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible crowne? Beloved; If wee would sit downe but one halfe houre, and consider serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what eternity is, it would make us to neglect all temporary things, which now we are so affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with. It is eternitie, my brethren, and the consideration of it, that doth set an high price upon grace, and gives the just weight to sinne, but it makes all other things exceeding light; for this is a true rule; that untill we come to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend sinne, as the greatest evill in the world, we are not truly humbled, and it is eternitie that makes it to be so; for (as was said before) eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie makes an evill infinitely the greater. Now if you looke upon all other things, as honour, and disgrace, and the favour of men, they reach but a little way, but to the end of this life, at the utmost; but if you looke to the reach of grace and sin, they reach (as it were) a thousand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand miles beyond it. Grace reacheth to eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and sinne reaches to eternitie, and therefore these are the things that a man should be busied about. What a shame is it for a man to grieve for some outward crosses, and to rejoyce much
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:15479:98"/>
for some preferment here; and not to regard or be affected with eternity: It is the phrase that the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> useth, he cals it <hi>mans day; I care not to be judged by mans day</hi>; and indeed it is but a short day; and what is it to that eternitie I looke for? What is it to that <hi>God,</hi> with whom I must live for ever? therefore I care not what men say of me, but I rather thinke what the eternall <hi>God</hi> thinkes of me, and what will be thought of mee in that Kingdome where I must live for ever. If a man were in <hi>Turkie,</hi> or in some other remote place, to trafficke there a while, hee would not care what the men of that place thought of him, for hee saith, this is not the place where I must live: so doe you but consider, that this is not the place where you must live, and then of what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will it appeare to you, what men say of you? Beloved, if the soule were mortall, there were some reason that you should make provision for it here; but seeing it is immortall, you ought to make a proportionable provision for it, even for ever: for the body you are apt to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, a <hi>viaticum</hi> beyond the journey; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that you have an immortall soule, which must live for ever, and you must make some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision for it, to carry it so long a journey. It is our Saviours exhortation, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.27.<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.27.</note> 
                  <hi>Labour not for the meat that perisheth, but for the meat that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures to everlasting life,</hi> &amp;c. As if he should say; if you had no other life to live but this, then you might seeke the things of this life, as glory, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, pleasure, &amp;c, but these things perish, and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:15479:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the taste of them perisheth, as the sweetnesse of meat in the eating; but (saith our Saviour) <hi>seeke those things that will abide for ever:</hi> you have an everlasting life to live, therefore you must make some provision answerable thereunto: As for the body, the soule weares it but as a garment, and when it is worne out, the soule must have a new suit of apparell one day.</p>
               <p>Well, seeing <hi>God</hi> hath brought this point to our hands this day, let me but prevaile with you so farre, as to set some time apart the following weeke, where you may enter into a serious consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of eternitie, the very thinking of it, will be of great moment to you; for looke what the object is, such is the soule, about which it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant; high objects lift up the soule to the <hi>Lord,</hi> and make the minde answerable to them, and low objects make the minde like to them. Now eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie is an high object, and it will worke in men high mindes; and hence it is, for the want of this consideration, that when a man comes to die, and sees eternitie before him, how it doth then so amaze the soule of man? I have seene it by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: I knew one who said, <hi>If it were but for a thousand yeares, I could beare it, but seeing it is to eternitie, this amazeth me.</hi> Behold, if you would consider, that after many thousands of yeares are past, yet you are to begin as at the first; if men did consider this seriously, would they let their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall estate depend so upon uncertainties. And let them consider this, that are yet strangers to the life of <hi>God,</hi> that if death should come, they should
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:15479:99"/>
not escape eternall death: it is good to keepe our thoughts upon this, and it would make us not to hasten after the things of the world, as we doe; and for thy sinne thou dotest on so, there are three things to be considered in it: First, the pleasure of it; is as the speckled skin of the Serpent: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the sting of sinne: and thirdly, the eternity of that sting. Now looke not thou upon the <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> of sinne, <hi>that endures but for a season,</hi> but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the hurt that comes from sinne, and then consider the eternity of it: a candle in a darke night makes a great shew, but when the Sunne comes, it vanisheth, and is nothing; so would all these things that wee doe so affect now, if they come before eternity in our thoughts: it is great wisdome in this kinde to husband our thoughts well, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29, 30, 31.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.29, 30, 31.</note> 
                  <hi>Vse this world, as not using it, for the fashion of this world passeth away:</hi> that is, minde them not much, be not much affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with them, one way or other, either in joy or griefe, let them be such as if they were not; for why? they are temporall things, passing things, things that continue not: for that is the thing I gather out of that place, that the <hi>Lord</hi> would not have our thoughts to be bestowed upon them, but so remissely, as if not at all, because there are eternall things, and set your minde upon them, <hi>for the time is short:</hi> As if he should say, thou hast not so much time to spare; the time is short, and you have businesse enough another way; there is water little enough to runne in the right channel, therefore let none runne beside; and the things
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:15479:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that should take up your minds, are sin, and grace, things that are eternall. It is a pitifull thing that the noble intentions of eternall mindes should be bestowed so ill upon these flitting things, which are nothing to eternity? A man that hath not much mony in his purse, but onely for to provide necessaries; when one comes and askes him to borrow any, he will say; I have no more than to buy me food and rayment, or if he hath his rent to pay, and no more; if one should come to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row any of him, he saith, no, I have no more than to pay my rents. So saith the Apostle there; you have no such spare time, no such spare affections, that you can bestow them else-where, but bestow them upon things that endure to eternall life.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And further to move you to this, consider the shortnesse and vanity of this life,<note place="margin">Motives here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</note> how all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde are hurried and rapt with a sudden motion to the west of their dayes. Our fathers went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, we follow them, and our children follow us at the heeles, as one wave followes another, and at last we are all dashed on the shore of death: and withal, consider the vanity that al conditions are subject unto; whether they be mountaines or valleyes; if mountaines, they are subject to blasts, to be envied; or if valleyes, to be over-drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, oppressed, and contemned; yea, the things that we prize most, honour and pleasure; what doe they but weary us, and then whet our appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite to a new edge? Consider the men that have beene before us; many men that have beene like a greene tree, but now the floud of their wealth is
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:15479:100"/>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Consider in the second place, what eternity is; here the body is corrupted with diseases, and the soule subject to vexation; but that life is sure, composed and constant, and there is no varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse in it; and if we desire life so much, why doe we esteeme this life that is but a span long, and neglect that which is so spacious.</p>

There is the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that which is in the hearts of men: Now you shall see what answer is made to it in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verse, <hi>Hast thou not knowne? hast thou not heard that the everlasting</hi> GOD <hi>the</hi> LORD, <hi>the Creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not, neither is wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? there is no searching of his understanding.</hi> The meaning is this; To us indeed the time is long, either when reward is deferred, or when the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, or the execution of sentence against evill works is deferred; but with <hi>God</hi> it is not so. Now that which makes it seeme long to us, is,</p>
               <p n="1">1 Partly the passions, and restlesnesse of the mind, (for that is motion) but <hi>God,</hi> he is without al motion or passion, and therefore nothing is long.</p>

Now to us that are in motion, and to the things that we have to doe with, a thousand yeares are a thousand yeares; but in <hi>God</hi> there is no motion, nor flux; and therefore a thousand

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1 It is proper to a Spirit to be invisible, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palpable,

not to bee discerned by any sense. Therfore <hi>Christ</hi> bids his Disciples to feele him: <hi>Behold my hands, and my feete</hi> (saith he) <hi>that it is I my selfe, handle, and see</hi>;<note place="margin">Luke 24.39.</note> 
               <hi>for a Spirit hath not flesh and bones as I have.</hi> A Spirit is that which is drawn from the sight of any corporeall sense whatsoever, and in this sense <hi>God</hi> is called a Spirit, because he is invisible: and therefore <hi>Moses</hi> is said to <hi>see him that is invisible,</hi> not by any bodily eye, but <hi>by</hi> the eye of <hi>faith.</hi>

            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  2, Every Spirit moves it selfe, and other things also: The body is but an earthy piece, that is not able to stirre it selfe at all, as you see it is when the soule is gone out of it, it is the spirit, that both moves it selfe, and carries the body up and downe where it listeth, and it moves it selfe with all speed, and agility, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it finds no resistance. Bodies, beside their elementarie motion vpward and downeward, have no voluntarie motion, they cannot move themselves whither they will, as spirits doe; And this I gather out of <hi>Ioh</hi> 3.8. the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is compared to the <hi>wind,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 3.8.</note> that <hi>blowes where it listeth.</hi>

            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  3. It is the propertie of every Spirit to move with exceeding great force and strength, and with much vehemency, so that it farre exceeds the strength of any body. Therefore in <hi>Isa:</hi> 31.3. speaking of the strength of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isay 31.3.</note> he saith, that <hi>they are flesh, and not spirit:</hi> as if hee should say; all flesh is weake, but the spirit is strong. Therefore you see, the Divells, that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:15479:106"/>
are spirits, what strength they have; and the man in the Gospell, that was possessed, it is said that <hi>he could breake the strongest bonds,</hi> and you see it commonly in those that are possessed, and you read, how he threw downe the house over <hi>Iobs</hi> children. This is the strength of the spirit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the strength of any body.</p>
            <p n="4">4 It insinuates it selfe, and enters into any bodily substance, without all penetration of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mension; that is, it is not held out of any place, by reason of a body, that is in it; it may be in it, though the place be otherwise full: as, you see, the soule is in the body, you shall find no where an emptie place, the body is every where whole; yet the Spirit insinuates it selfe in every part, and no body can keepe it out. And so is <hi>God</hi>; he is invisible, not seene by any eye, hee moves himselfe, and all things in the world, as he lists; and he doth what he doth with excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great strength; and then, hee fills every place, both heaven and earth; what bodies so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be there, yet he may be there notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. And thus you see in what sense this is to be understood, <hi>God</hi> is a Spirit</p>
            <p>Now we will come to apply this.</p>

               </note> There are many things in the world, which his hand hath made: but that which he chiefely lookes to, is the minde, and spirit of man. Whereas a man consists of two parts, a

body and a spirit, it is the spirit that is like to <hi>God</hi>: and in regard of the spirituall substance of the soule, it is said to be made after his Image, and therefore in <hi>Heb:</hi> 12, <hi>God</hi> is called, the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Spirits</hi>: Why? He is the Father of the body also, he made that, but the meaning is, that he is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Father over them, because he guides and nurtures them, being most like to himselfe: as the sonne is like the father, so they are like to him, and therefore hee most regards the spirits of men. As you may see when <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> went to anoint <hi>David</hi> King, and all the sonnes of <hi>Iesse</hi> came before him, those that were much more proper than <hi>David, God</hi> tells him, that he did not looke upon the persons of men, nor upon their <hi>outward appearance,</hi> hee heedes them not; what doth he then? he sees the soule and spirit of man; the <hi>Lord looketh upon the heart,</hi> and according to that hee judgeth of them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.7.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 16.7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if his eye be chiefly upon the spirit, thou shouldest labour to let thine eye be chiefly still upon thy spirit, and so thou shalt most please him. Let thy eye be upon thy soule, to keepe it cleane, that it may be fit for communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him, who is a spirit. This should teach you to looke to the fashion of your soules with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, because they are likest to him, and carry his image in them; he is a father of them in a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all manner, and they are that whereby you may have communion with him, in that which is most proper unto him, in spirituall exercises and performances.</p>

this pleaseth the Lord; not that the affliction of a mans spirit is pleasing to the Lord, but the separation of sinne from his soule, when the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that joynes a sinfull action and the heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, when this is dissolved, this doth please the Lord. And by the rule of contraries, if this be true, then it is true, on the other side, that when the spirit is glued by any lust to any inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate thing, it is most hatefull to <hi>God:</hi> for the stronger the lust is, the stronger is the glue; and therefore a man the more he is tyed to this world, and hath such strong lusts, the more hee hath this uncleannesse and pollution of spirit. And therefore as a broken heart is most accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God: so a spirit that is knit to any inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate object, by the thing, that it cleaves to, it becomes most hatefull and abominable to him.</p>
            <p>Consider, that although a lust left at liberty, when God hath taken off the chaine, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it to doe what it will, doth contract more guilt, and doth indeede more hurt to mankind; yet he that hath a heart as full of lust, and filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, is no lesse abominable, and odious in <hi>Gods</hi> sight. Take a wolfe, that runnes up and downe, and kills the sheepe, that wolfe is abominable, and every one cries out against him; but a wise man that sees a wolfe tyed up in a chaine, hates that as much as he did the other: for he knowes that he hath the same nature, and would doe as much hurt if he were let loose: So we may say of men, whose hearts are full of lusts, <hi>God</hi> it may be, hath tyed them up, so that they breake not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:15479:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
forth; yet these lusts are abominable and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in his sight, though they doe not so much hurt, nor breake so many commandements. Therfore let them consider this, that live under good families, good Tutours, or in good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly they are as wolves tied up, they cannot break forth so into outward acts, it may be, they are restrained by reason of some bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies favour that they would not lose, or the like, but yet they give way to the spirit within, that rangeth and lusteth up and downe; and this is therefore defiled in <hi>Gods</hi> sight.</p>

Hee begins to loathe himselfe, hee would not owne his owne selfe, if hee could; hee would goe out of himselfe, he is weary of his owne heart: such a hatred and loathing thou must have of this pollution of spirit that is in thee. And this thou shalt doe, if thou wilt but consider, what evill this pollution doth bring thee, and what hurt filthinesse hath done to thee: a man can hate the disease of the body, and cry out of it; and why should not men doe so of the soule? It is our sinne that is the cause of all evill; it is not poverty, or disgrace, or sicknesse, but it is sinne in thy poverty, sinne in thy disgrace, sinne in thy sicknesse: so that if a man could looke upon sinne as the greatest evill, and that doth him the greatest mischiefe, he would hate that above all things. And here remember not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to doe it in generall, but to pitch thy hatred chiefly upon thy beloved sinne.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> To fit thy spirit for the Lord, that is a spirit, and the father of spirits, thou must goe yet one step further; thou must labour to beautifie it, to seeke to adorne it by a spirituall excellency. Now if thou wouldest beautifie it by any thing, seeke not for outward excellencies, as clothes, or fine apparell, or adorning in the sight of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:15479:112"/>
men, but seeke such an excellency as is sutable to the spirit: seeke not other things; for they are such things that <hi>God</hi> regards not. So that, as every man seekes some excellency or other, that which thou art to seeke is, to get spirituall excellency, such as may beautifie thy heart, for that which is outward, <hi>God</hi> regardeth not.

So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3. you have a comparison there of outward excellencies,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.3.</note> and of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall decking of the inward man, which the Apostle preferreth, because that is a thing that is esteemed of by <hi>God. Whose adorning,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>let it not be that outward adorning, of plaiting the haire, and of wearing golde, or of putting on of apparell: But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meeke and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.</hi> So it is said of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.22.<note place="margin">Prov. 3.22.</note> 
               <hi>It shall be life to thy soule, and grace to thy necke:</hi> that is, <hi>wisedome</hi> adornes the soule in the sight of <hi>God,</hi> therefore that is the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:15479:112"/>
excellency that is chiefly to be sought by us, even thus to adorne the soule. And there is good reason for it: for, if thou consider what thy body is, and what thy spirit is, thou shalt see, that all these things that doe adorne the outward man, are not the excellencies to bee sought after. Indeed there are divers kindes of those excellencies; they are of three sorts. First, excellency of <hi>clothes,</hi> and <hi>building,</hi> and such gaudy things, which children and vaine men and women are sensible of. Secondly, great <hi>titles,</hi> and <hi>honours,</hi> and great rewards, which a higher sort of men are capable of. Thirdly, the excellency of <hi>learning,</hi> and <hi>knowledge,</hi> and <hi>skill</hi> in <hi>arts</hi> and <hi>sciences</hi>; and this also is but an outward excellency: for though it be seated in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, yet it inables onely to outward things. These are not the excellencies that thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest seeke for: but it is an excellency of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, thou art to regard: looke to thy spirit what that is: for as the spirit is, such is the man. <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus est perfectio hominis,</hi> this is the proper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency: the body is but, as it were, the sheath for the soule; a man is said to be more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, as his soule is excellent. Other excellency is but an outward excellency, this excellency is that which is intrinsecall to a man; the other are but adventitious, they are not proper, it is not that which makes the difference. <hi>The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous is more excellent than his neighbour:</hi> There is a difference of honour, but all these are but accidentall differences: the essential difference
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:15479:113"/>
is the spirit, and that is it which <hi>God</hi> regards and by this thou excellest thy neighbour. All other excellencies are but as when a mule or an asse having goodly trappings, should boast it selfe against the horse, which is a goodly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, because it hath goodly trappings; or as if a mud-wall, that the Sunne shines upon, should boast it selfe against a wall of marble that stands in the shadow. Therefore consider of this, that so thou maist labour to beautifie thy spirit; if there were no other reason, but that he is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and that he beholdes the excellency of the spirit, this were sufficient. Take all other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies in the world, they make thee onely excellent in the sight of man; but this makes thee excellent before <hi>God,</hi> this is a solid thing, all the glory of the world is but <gap reason="foreign">

A Prince, or a man hath power to kill, or to save, he can give riches, and honor, and take them away, at his pleasure: But to rule the spirits, to compose, and guide the apprehensions, and affections of the soule, that belongs to <hi>God</hi> alone; a man is no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to doe it, than to rule the raging sea. For
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:15479:118"/>
as it is proper to <hi>God</hi> alone, to compose the winde, and to rule the waves: so it is proper to him alone to rule the turbulent affections, to compose, and guide them. If there be any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered affection in the heart, as an immoderate love of any thing, or an impatient desire to any thing, who, is able to remove it, but the Lord who is a <hi>Spirit?</hi> So, who can implant holy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in thee, but he alone? as, for example, <hi>to thinke a good thought,</hi> a man cannot do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, who is <hi>the Father of spirits</hi>; so to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade a man, no man can doe it, it must be the Lord, as <hi>Noah</hi> saith; <hi>God shall perswade</hi> Laphet <hi>to dwell in the Tents of Sem.</hi> So to see the hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nousnesse of sinne, and the evill of it, no man can doe it but by the spirit of <hi>God,</hi> as it is said. <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.9.<note place="margin">Iohn 16.9.</note>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3 Because the guiding of a mans spirit, is of the greatest consequence of all other things else. Now <hi>God</hi> is a wise commander, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will not exert, and put forth his power, but in things of greatest moment: but the guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our affections is all in all to us. For, in a mans outward estate, what things soever befall him, all are nothing; but what his apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:15479:119"/>
is of them, and how he is affected to them, makes them crosses or comforts: if a mans spirit be whole, the greatest crosse is nothing, and the least is intolerable, if his spirit be broken. As, againe, what are all pleasant things, if a man hath not a heart to apprehend them? As to <hi>Paul,</hi> what was all his persecution? as long as his spirit was whole within him, he carried it out well: and what was <hi>Paradise</hi> to <hi>Adam,</hi> and a kingdome to <hi>Ahab,</hi> when their spirit was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken? It is the apprehension that makes every thing to a man heavy, or unheavy, pleasant or unpleasant, sweete or sower: and therefore this is the use to be made of it, to behold <hi>Gods</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence cheifely on our spirits, and not onely in our owne spirits, but what he doth vpon the spirits of others also. It is a thing we stumble at, when we see a wicked man prosper, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry all things in the world before him, we should not say, where is <hi>Gods</hi> providence, and the truth of his promise? but see what he doth upon the spirit of that man. If thou seest such a man more malicious to the Church, and children of <hi>God,</hi> growing more carnall, and abominable in his courses, therein is <hi>Gods</hi> curse seene more, than in all the dispensation of outward curses: for that treasure of sinne which he layes up for himselfe, will draw on a treasure of wrath, which will be executed in due season. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beholde your spirits alwayes, and <hi>Gods</hi> providence upon them. <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.65.<note place="margin">Lam. 3 65.</note> 
               <hi>Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse upon them:</hi> the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:15479:119"/>
words signifie, which is thy curse upon them. Therefore if you see an obstinate heart in a man, that is the greatest curse of all. As in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Sacrament, there wee doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce a curse to him that <hi>receives it unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and prophanes the <hi>Lords body:</hi> but, it may be, he goes on and sees it not; but now looke upon his spirit, and see how GOD deales with that, whether his heart doth not grow harder, and more obdurate, which is the greatest curse? You may observe this every where. If thou seest one that hath a vaine and idle spirit, that cannot studie, that cannot pray, that cannot choose but be carried away by an unruly lust to this or that thing, believe it, this is a greater judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than all the diseases in the world, than all shame and disgrace, that wee account so much of, than poverty and crosses: as it is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test mercy, on the other side, when a man is able to serve GOD with an upright heart, and to be sincere in all his carriage. Thus it is with men, and this thou shouldest observe in thy selfe also from day to day. Let us not observe so much, what accidents befall us, what good is done to us, or what crosses wee have, (it is true indeed GOD is seene in all these things) but chiefly looke what GOD hath done to our spirit, what composing of minde, or what tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulency of affections, or what quietnesse, what patience, or what impatience; and for this be chiefly humbled, or be chiefly thankfull: for to take away from Christ the praise of sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:15479:120"/>
is as much as to take away the praise of his redemption. Herein thou shalt see his love or hatred manifested to thee; his greatest judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shewed to thee, or his greatest mercies.</p>

            <p>So that to <hi>worship</hi> GOD <hi>in spirit,</hi> is, to have a plainnesse, and sincerity in our worshipping him, that is, to doe it heartily what we doe to him; in our praying, and worshipping him, when it is not formally, and customarily done, but our spirit seconds it within, this it is to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him in spirit.

agree, they are consonant, and when yet, it may be, the inward inclination of thy heart is farre enough off from this expression: therefore bring thy spirit neare to <hi>God</hi> as thy lippes are, and then thou worshippest him in spirit. To shew you more plainly what this farrenesse off of the spirit is; take a covetous man, and put him upon the racke of any exigent, where hee must part with all to save his life, he will say as much as need to be in this case: but his heart is set as close to his wealth, as ever it was before, so that he is loath to part with any thing. And take a thiefe that comes before the Iudge, hee confesseth his fault, and begges pardon, and saith that he will doe so no more: but yet his heart sits as neere to his theft, he is as farre from honesty as ever he was before. So take a man, when he comes into some exigent, (for that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually is the time) as at the receiving of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, or at his day of death, he comes and professeth to the <hi>Lord,</hi> that hee will follow no more his wicked courses; but he will become a new man, here his words draw neare, but looke to the bent and inclination of his heart, to the radicall constitution of it, and that is farre from holinesse, there hee sits as close to his sinne as hee did before. Therefore, if thou wouldest <hi>worship God in spirit,</hi> take care that thy spirit draw neare to him upon all such occasions, as thy words doe.

shewes. It is a strange thing, that at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, men come and make confession of their sins: and yet their spirits are far from it, and that their practise shewes. Consider this; you are the men that the Prophet doth speake too, <hi>you draw nigh to</hi> GOD <hi>with your lips, but your heart is farre from him.</hi> And this is the first particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> When you worship God with all the might and strength, and indevour of the minde and all the faculties of it, this is to <hi>worship God in spirit.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.14.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 6.14.</note> It is said of <hi>David,</hi> that hee <hi>danced before the Lord with all his might</hi>: it was a worship of God, a spirituall worship of God, wherein <hi>David,</hi> by his outward act of dancing, did expresse his exultation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing in the Lord. Now the text saith, that he did this with all his might, with all the might of his spirit; (for so you must understand it.) It is a Metaphore taken from the body, when a man useth all his strength, and might to doe any thing, he vnites all the forces of his body to it: so a man <hi>worshippeth God in spirit,</hi> when all the faculties of the soule, are concentred and united together in the performance of such a dutie. And therefore it is called a <hi>wrastling with the Lord,</hi> as <hi>Iacob</hi> did: and it is called a <hi>stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with God,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that you <hi>strive together with me in prayer: Rom.</hi> 15.30.<note place="margin">Rom. 15, 30.</note> that is, when the soule, and the minde are joyned all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, when hee bends the whole soule to the worke, this is to worship God in spirit. Such
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:15479:122"/>
an expression you haue, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.<note place="margin">Acts 20.</note> where <hi>Paul went bound in the spirit to Ierusalem</hi>; that is, his spirit did not hang loose, but it was girt up in a resolution to goe through with the worke, whatsoever came of it, his spirit was bound. Now, when thy spirit hangs loose upon the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, halfe on, and halfe off, when a man cares not whether hee doth it or no, this is not to worship God with the spirit; but when thy minde is girt up, and thou dost it with all the intention of thy soule, then thou dost it hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as it is <hi>Col.</hi> 3.22.<note place="margin">Col 3.22.</note> 
               <hi>Servants obey in all things your Masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men pleasers, but in singlenesse of heart fearing</hi> GOD: where eye-service, and heartily are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. Eye-service is, when a man doth it in the outward shew, and appearance onely, and what is the other, to doe a thing heartily? That is, when a mans strength and his soule doth goe with the duty: and the contrary to this is, the loosenesse of the minde, and the wandring of it about other things, when the body, and the words are well imployed, but the minde doth not goe with them; this is not to worship God in spirit, when the spirit sits thus loose to God. And this is the second thing, wherein this worshipping of God in spirit, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The Third which hath not much, but yet some difference from the former, is this, when the spirit of a man beholds God alone; when his eye is upon him, when hee comes to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:15479:122"/>
him, and upon nothing besides. If a man will have an eye to men, to the praise, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praise that shall follow the performance of the duty, he doth so farre worship men. But hee serves <hi>God</hi> and worships him in spirit, when his heart is left naked, and stripped of all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects in the world, and so filled, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed with the presence of God, that all other respects doe vanish. This it is to worship God in singlenesse of heart; and this is opposed to outward performance <hi>Col.</hi> 3.22.<note place="margin">Col. 3.22.</note> for eye-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is but onely a bodily and outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: but when a man doth it with singlenesse of heart, then it is not eye-service as there; that is, it is not outward onely. Now, singlenesse of heart is this; when the minde hath but one single object to looke upon; so that to looke, not upon any creature, but upon God, and none besides. This is to worship God in singlenesse of heart, which is the same with holinesse of spirit. As the holinesse of the vessell in the old law was when it was set apart from all other services to God alone, so the holinesse of a mans spirit is, when it is separated from all by-respects and aimes, and is wholly devoted to him (whence our word, <hi>Devotion</hi> doth spring) and when a man worships God with this naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, with this singlenes and holinesse of spirit, then he worships God in spirit. But when thou commest to performe any duty, as to preach a Sermon, or to pray, and thou lookest what men will thinke of thee, and what praise and credit thou shalt get by it, this pollutes your spirit; so
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:15479:123"/>
farre as you doe this, there is not singlenesse, but doublenesse of spirit, and here is eye-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in GODS account.</p>
            <p>Therefore looke alwayes to worship him in spirit, remember the argument here used, GOD is a Spirit: that is, looke how the corporeall eye of man beholds the body, when thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest to Church, and can see the negligence of thy behaviour, and uncomely gesture; so GOD, that is a spirit, he beholds the vanity and loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of thy spirit within, the turning and rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it this way, or that way; therefore take diligent heede to thy spirit; labour to approve thy selfe to him, care not what any creature saith or thinketh of thee; and this is to worship him in thy spirit.</p>
            <p>Now here are two Questions to be answered.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Quest. </seg>1</label> If GOD must thus be worshipped in spirit, and it is the behaviour of that which he lookes to, what necessity is there then of a bodily, comely, and outward gesture? how farre is this required in his worship?<note place="margin">What necessity there is of fit gestures of the body in <hi>Gods</hi> worship.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
               </label> The spirituall worship of <hi>God</hi> is never well performed, but when it is signified by the comely gesture of the body, as farre as wee may. I say, they must concurre, the body must goe with the spirit, (though indeed he chiefly lookes to the spirit) for they are both his, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6, 20.</note> Besides, the body doth exceedingly helpe the spirit, and it doth testifie, when you come before others, that holinesse and reverence, which you have of <hi>Gods</hi> glory and majesty.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:15479:123"/>
Therefore to perswade you to this, you must know, that when ever you come to worship <hi>God,</hi> there ought to be a great solemnity in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part of his worship, which cannot be without the concurrence of the body and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of man, they cannot be disjoyned: And you shall see the necessity of this, in these 3 things.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Because, though holinesse be seated in the spirit, yet it doth &amp; will appeare in the body at the same time. You know, the light of the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle is seated in the candle, yet it shines through the lant-horne, if it be there; so, though holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse be seated in the spirit, yet it will appeare in the body, if it be there. It is so in all other things, and therefore must needes be so in this: As, take any affections that are in us, as a blush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affection, when occasion is, it will appeare in the body, whether we will or no; so an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent face is discerned and perceived also; so awefulnesse, and feare, and reverence, they will shew themselves, and looke out at the windowes of the eyes, and appeare in the face, except we willingly suppresse them. Now, if these will doe so; surely it holds in this also. If there be a reverence of the minde, it will be seene in the behaviour of the body. Therefore you see; <hi>Eliah,</hi> when he prayed earnestly, the dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body went with it, <hi>he put his face downe betweene his legges.</hi> So <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> when hee prayed for <hi>Lazarus, hee groaned in his spirit, and wept.</hi> Now if he did so, (who might be exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if any might) then doe not thou thinke that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:15479:124"/>
thou canst have a holy, reverent disposition of the minde, and it not appeare in the body, it cannot be. Therefore you shall finde, that this is called the heart every where, because the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are seated there; and now the body is accordingly affected as the heart is affected; for what affections a man hath, such is his heart.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Consider this; If thou findest thy selfe apt to a carelesse, negligent behaviour, and carriage of the body, when thou commest to GOD, and pretendest this, that he is a spirit, and must be worshipped in spirit; I say, consider, whether this be not an excuse that thy flesh makes to this end, that it may be lazie, and have some ease to it selfe, from a false acception of that principle, <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> that so it may give way to an outward lazinesse of the body. Therefore looke narrowly to it, thou shouldest stirre up the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, that thou thereby maist stirre up the inward man, when thou commest before <hi>God</hi> in any worship.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Consider, that to make any thing an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, there must be an application of the whole man to it; otherwise, it is but a lame performance, and <hi>God</hi> will not reckon as the obedience of an ordinance. For this truth must be remembred; That an ordinance of <hi>God</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed as it ought to be, doth usually carry a blessing with it. A prayer, a Sacrament recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as it ought, a fast kept as it should, moves the <hi>Lord</hi> to give a blessing, if thou doest not
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:15479:124"/>
               <hi>Ponere obicem,</hi> thou shalt not goe away empty; for it is alwayes accompanied with a blessing: as it is said to <hi>Ananias, Acts</hi> 9.<note place="margin">Acts 9.</note> 
               <hi>Goe to Paul, for behold he prayes:</hi> when it is a prayer indeed, <hi>God</hi> can holde no longer. Doe you thinke, that <hi>Paul</hi> never prayed before, when he was a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise? Yes; but it was not as he ought, he never prayed indeed till now; now consider, when thou commest before the <hi>Lord</hi> to performe any duty to him, thou wilt say, it may be, that my spirit is well disposed, though the gesture of my body be not according? but I say, deceive not thy selfe with this, but looke that it be a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row performance. For as it was in the old law, a lame sacrifice was accepted as none: so a lame prayer, a lame hearing the word, a lame perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of any exercise <hi>God</hi> reckons as none. Therefore in these things <hi>God</hi> sends them away empty as they came. What better are they? doe their hearts get any thing? Beloved, <hi>God</hi> is a fountaine, and if he meet with a fit pipe, (as is an ordinance rightly performed there he usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conveyes his grace: but if he meet with a foule pipe, and obstructed, there hee doth not conferre any blessing.</p>
            <p>Now, if thou saist, I have thus behaved my selfe, and have not beene answered? Doe not deceive thy selfe; for if it be truly performed, you shall be answered: so that looke, if it be truly done, expect a blessing, GOD will not suffer his ordinance, at that time, to be a pen without inke, or a pipe without water. I hope
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:15479:125"/>
there be none of us here that neglect prayer to GOD morning, and evening, that live as if there no GOD in the world, as if they were not his subjects: if there be, GOD will wound the hoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry scalpe of such. But these are not the men I speake to; but they are those that doe it from day to day, they pray from time to time, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it not; these are the men, whom wee are to advertise in this case. Take heede, though you pray every day, yet it may be thou hast not made a prayer all thy life yet, and this is the case of many. For, if thou considerest what an ordinance is indeed, thou shalt know that the <hi>Lord</hi> doth not reckon all petitioning as a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, nor set it downe for the ordinance. And it may bee the case of the Saints sometimes, (though we speake not now to them) they may pray often, and yet the <hi>Lord</hi> not register, nor set it downe for a prayer, and therefore it may never come into remembrance before him. And this I take to be <hi>Davids</hi> case in the time of his adultery; the ground of which you shall see, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.16, 17.<note place="margin">Psal. 51.16, 17</note> 
               <hi>Open thou my lips</hi> (O LORD) <hi>and my mouth shall set forth thy praise: David</hi> had, as it were, mistaken himselfe, he thought that he had prayed, and offered a sacrifice, but, saith he, I was deceived all this while, I was not able to open my mouth to any purpose; therefore, <hi>Lord,</hi> open thou my mouth; I brought sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in, but thou regardest it not, till my heart was humbled; Therefore, a broken and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite heart, O GOD, thou wilt not despise.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:15479:125"/>
Therefore you deceive your selves, that goe on in a customary performance of holy duties, and thinke that you pray for all this; that thinke this worship to be in the spirit onely, when your outward man carries it selfe negligently; this is but a lame performance, they must goe both together. Therefore looke that it be an ordinance, which then it is, when not onely the spirit of a man is well set, but the whole man is applied to the duty, that is, when all the strength of a man goes to it.</p>

               </label> If you say, May not a man pray sometimes, when he is walking, or lying, or riding by the way, or the like?</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
               </label> I answer, There be two times of prayer, one is ordinary, and in private, when you may have all opportunity to doe it in a holy, and solemne manner, and then you ought to doe it solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The other is, when you pray occasionally; and there the occasion and disposition doth not admit such outward solemnity; as when a man gives thankes at meate, or prayeth when hee rides; Here the <hi>Lord</hi> accepts the will for the deed: GOD requires not this upon all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; yet when you may, you ought to doe it, in a reverent manner, not onely of spirit, but of the bodie also. You may gather it from <hi>Christ, he fell on his face and prayed, Luke</hi> 22.42. and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 22, 42.</note> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> it is said that they bowed themselves to the ground: And it is said of Christ, that hee lifted up his eyes to heaven, when he blessed the loaves. Why are these set
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:15479:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>
downe? If any man might be freed, <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> might; but it pleaseth the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> to set downe that circumstance of him, that he fell on his face, and that hee lift up his eyes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>Indeed, in this case when it is hurtfull to the body, there it may be omitted; the <hi>Lord</hi> will have mercie rather than sacrifice, even mercie upon your bodies. So also, when you finde that it hurts the inward man, and hinders it, when the heart doth it out of a conceit, that it may performe it the better, then there is a libertie left unto you to dispense with it.</p>
            <p>As I say for prayer, so for other duties: when a man comes to heare the word, hee saith, my minde is intent enough, though I make not such a shew; yet notwithstanding know this, that thou must behave thy self reverently when thou commest before <hi>God.</hi> You shall see in <hi>Luke</hi> 4. when Christ preached,<note place="margin">Luke 4.</note> it is said, that <hi>the eyes of all the people were fastened upon him.</hi> Why is such a corporall gesture noted in the text? is it in vaine? No, because it is a comely gesture, therefore it is to be regarded.</p>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:15479:128"/>
so in all things else: so that the reason of multiplication is, because one will not serve the turne. Therefore GOD being all-sufficient, it is not needfull, yea it cannot be, that a brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king into two should be admitted in him, and consequently, he must be most simple, without all composition, a pure and intire essence, full of himselfe, and nothing besides.</p>

As in the <hi>Babylonish</hi> furnace, GOD separated betweene the fire, and the heate, that it could not burne the men that were cast into it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. So he doth
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:15479:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with the Angells, he comes betweene the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and the executive power, and often hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them from doing what they would: But in GOD, seeing hee is most <hi>simple,</hi> and <hi>intire,</hi> there is not an essence, and executive power, (as the Schoolemen call it:) therefore there can nothing come betweene to be an impediment; there is not any action that he intends, but he workes it absolutely and of himselfe. Therefore we are to consider, that that GOD which we have to worship and serve, that nothing can come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene, and hinder him in working, but what he will doe, he doth: and therefore wee should learne to feare before him, and to trust in him, and to acknowledge the greatnesse of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and to know the ground of it, seeing he is so absolute and wonderfull in all his workes.</p>
            <p>Hence likewise it followes,<note place="margin">

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:15479:131"/>
that his <hi>mercy is over,</hi> and <hi>upon all his workes.</hi> As the warmth of the hen is <hi>over</hi> all the egges, to warme, and cherish, and hatch them: so <hi>Gods mercy is over all his workes,</hi> to cherish, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, and perfect them; that is, it is shewed forth <hi>upon</hi> them all. For it is not a comparative speech, as if his mercy did exceed all his other Attributes: for if all his Attributes are himselfe, they must be equall, there is no difference in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of height or largenesse betweene them. And thus the place is to be understood: for so the word signifies in the originall, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common acception.

               </label> The naturall condition cannot be changed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it may be exceedingly helped; as, if wee bring our hearts to be content with a more or lesse simplicity of condition, that is, if the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position and constitution of the minde be such, that it be not dependent upon many things, but upon few; this is done, when the thoughts and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:15479:132"/>
affections of the minde doe not lie scattered, hanging or lying upon this or that thing, so that you cannot live without it; but when the mind is recollected and gathered up, so that you can be content with a simplicity of condition, with GOD alone for your portion; so that you can live with exceeding little, not requiring a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of things, upon which the contentment. and satisfaction of the minde doth depend. As for example; some men cannot live without sports and pleasure, and a great living to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them: another must have great learning and gifts, and eminency, and praise that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes it: Another hath his heart so wedded to a convenient house, wife, children, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, &amp;c. that if any of these be taken away, he is dead in the nest: Not to speake of their vaine, base, distempered affections, they must have a hundred things, their fancy is infinite, and all must be to their minde, or else they are still complaining. Now the more things a man needes, the more compound, and lesse simple he is, (as I may so say) and consequently, the weaker he is, and more apt to be hindred, more apt to be hurt and disquieted; because if you touch any of that multitude of things, upon which his heart is set, he is presently troubled; which is more easily done, as the things are more, upon which his affections are placed: but he is best, who is come to that selfe-suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of minde, and to be content with that sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of condition, that he can say of any of

these things; I can live by them and without them, I can live without liberty, I can live without friends, I can live without sports and pleasure, without worldly credit, and esteeme, without wife, and children, without riches, without conveniency of aire, garden, orchards.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:15479:133"/>
one for his arme, another for his legges, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his back: whereas a stronge man can walke upon his owne legges, hee needs noe other helpe: even so the soule, the more sicke and lame it is, the more it needs; but he which hath a strong inward man which is in health, let him have GOD, and shift him from vessell to vessell, from condition to condition, let him bee stripped of all, yet hee can goe upon his legges and can live without all.

This <hi>singlenesse of heart David</hi> expresseth in himselfe, <hi>Psa.</hi> 27.4. <hi>One thing have I desired, that I will require, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all my dayes and behold thy beauty:</hi> that is, this one thing have I chosen, I have pitched upon it, I care for nothing besides; if other things come, so it is, but this I require, that I may walke with the Lord, that I may <hi>bee in his house all my dayes,</hi> that is, that I may injoy the vse of GODS ordinances, and walke with him; and <hi>behold
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:15479:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his beauty</hi> in them. And such a speech was that of <hi>Christ</hi> to <hi>Martha; One thing is necessary</hi>; that is, if you looke to any thing else, it is in vaine: you ought to take him alone, as a wife takes a husband, that must have none besides, (for so it must be.) And this is the first thing required to <hi>simplicity</hi> and <hi>singlenesse of spirit.</hi> The second is this.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Let the heart be cleansed from all admixture of sinfull affections, and so brought into such a frame, that it may be apt to looke onely upon one object, upon <hi>God</hi> alone. And this I take out of <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.22. <hi>The light of the body is the eye, if then the eye be single, the whole body shall be light, &amp;c.</hi> even as the eye guides all the members of the body, the hands, feet, &amp;c. so doth the heart or minde guide all the actions of a man. Now as the eye, if it be vitiated or distempered with drunkennesse, or surfeit, or the like, it doth not represent things single, but double, and treble, and so makes a man to walke unevenly: so sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full affections, which are contrary to the <hi>sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity</hi> of the minde, doe so distemper it that it cannot looke upon <hi>God</hi> alone, as upon one sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle object, but it hath an eye to other objects with him, and he is distempered betweene them, and so he walkes unevenly. As for example, feare will make a man to walke in a double way; all miscarriage and double-dealing car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage comes from feare; were it not for feare, men would be plaine, and simple: therefore feare of men, or any creature, losse of credit, life or
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:15479:135"/>
liberty, this is a snare, and distempers the eye; and till the heart be cleansed of these, you will never walke evenly. And so doth covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse distemper us, and voluptuousnesse, or any <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in any kinde, any over-eager desire, or too much haste to accomplish the end which a man propounds to himselfe. So <hi>Iacobs</hi> too much hasting after the blessing made him not to looke single upon <hi>God</hi>; but to goe a double and uneven way in using unlawfull meanes to obtaine it. And <hi>Ieroboams</hi> too greedy desire of the Kingdome, made him to joyne <hi>God</hi> and the Calves together: for two severall principles cause two severall motions. And so is it when there is any inordinate affection, be it what it will be, there is not a <hi>simplicity</hi> of heart; and if there be not, you will never looke upon <hi>God</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but upon some creature, upon some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or other. Therefore, <hi>Iames</hi> 4.8.<note place="margin">Iames 4.8.</note> 
               <hi>Cleanse your hearts you wavering-minded.</hi> As if when the heart was cleansed from corruption, the minde would be freed from wavering, and brought to simplicity: were the heart purged, there would be a constancy and evennesse in our mouth, and in all our wayes.</p>
            <p>This expression of <hi>simplicity</hi> you shall finde in <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.16.<note place="margin">Matth. 10.16.</note> 
               <hi>Beholde I send you as sheepe among wolves: be wise therefore as serpents, and innocent as doves.</hi> The meaning is this: I send you (saith our Saviour) among men as cruell as <hi>wolves,</hi> that will persecute, and hurt, and devoure you; wherefore <hi>be wise as serpents,</hi> that is, as <hi>serpents</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:15479:136"/>
have many wiles, doe winde and turne to shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter off a stroke, and defend their head, so doe you: but on the other side, take heede of being too fearefull of this persecution, so that when to endure it comes to be a duty, you doe not shrinke backe and withdraw your selves, but in such a case let your hearts be <hi>simple,</hi> cleansed from such an inordinate affection, as that feare is; and even take that blow, as the <hi>doves</hi> doe, which have no wiles as the <hi>serpents</hi> have to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselves. So that in any such case when a duty is to be done, as the professing of my name, or the like, here you must take the blow as willingly as the <hi>dove</hi> doth, there is no avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in such a case; therefore take heed that your hearts be <hi>simple,</hi> that there be no feare there, so that you must be haled to the duty. And this is the very meaning and scope of the words. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent as doves,</hi> that is, let no sinfull inordinate temptation admixe it selfe, and so deprive you of this <hi>simplicity</hi> of heart, because you doe not like my service.</p>
            <p>This you shall see lively exemplified in Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>For our rejoycing is this, the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sinceritie, not with fleshly wisedome, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you wards.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was a very prudent man, and therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above all the Apostles, as <hi>Saul</hi> was angry with <hi>David,</hi> because <hi>he walked wisely,</hi> he was so subtle to escape out of his hands, which is as if
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:15479:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the hounds should complaine of the hare, that she hath so many trickes to escape from them: but, as I say, he was a very prudent man, and he used the <hi>serpents wisedome</hi> to save himselfe, as he did when the assembly consisted of <hi>Sadduces</hi> and <hi>Pharises,</hi> he put a division betweene them, and so escaped himselfe, as it were through the middest of them. So the first part was true in him, he was <hi>as wise as a serpent,</hi> to keepe the blow off from himselfe. But now (saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle) if carnall wisedome shall come in, that is, if my understanding shall suggest a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate, and shall say, Goe, and give a bribe to <hi>Faelix,</hi> and thou shalt escape imprisonment, goe and take a gift of these <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and thou shalt have something of thine owne, and shalt not be so dependent on the almes of others; now, saith he, when carnall wisedome shall sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest any such thing to mee, I would not admit of it, but I walked in <hi>simplicity</hi> and godly pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse toward all men, but especially toward you, <hi>Corinthians</hi>; here was in him the <hi>simplicity</hi> of the <hi>Doves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That we might draw it to a little more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, you shall see an other expression of this, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Servants be obedient to them that are your masters in the flesh, with feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, in singlenesse of your heart as unto Christ:</hi> that is, <hi>servants,</hi> take heede even <hi>with feare and trembling,</hi> that you admit not by and sinfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects in performing your duty, as there are many motives, as feare, hope, reward, and a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:15479:137"/>
to doe it, but keepe your <hi>hearts single</hi> that you may looke onely upon <hi>Christ</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and then you shall be faithfull in your service; but if other respects mingle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with this <hi>simplicity,</hi> you will doe but <hi>eye-service,</hi> you will doe it in a double and dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling manner, not plainely, and heartily, and <hi>simply.</hi> Therefore let us put in practise this <hi>simplicity</hi> upon all occasions, in all other things whatsoever. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.8.<note place="margin">Rom. 12.8.</note> 
               <hi>He that distributeth let him doe it in simplicity:</hi> that is, men are subiect to by ends in their good workes; as in giuing almes, or shewing a kindenesse to men, there may be many by-respects, as that they may make use of them heareafter or the like, but, saith hee, keepe you your <hi>hearts simple,</hi> to looke upon GOD alone in them. So in conversing with men, when you professe love and kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, you are subject to by ends in doing it, but they are commended, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.46. that they did <hi>eat their meat with gladnesse and singlenesse of heart</hi>: that is, what love they professed one to another, it was <hi>simple</hi> and plaine, not double. Compare this place with that in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you have purified your selves in obeying the truth through the Spirit, vnto vnfained love of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; see that yee love one another with a pure love fervently:</hi> that is, when there is nothing else, when the heart is <hi>simple</hi> and plaine, when there is nothing but love, noe mixture, noe by ends in it. So likewise when you come to preach the Gospell, doe it in <hi>simplicity</hi> of heart, that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:15479:137"/>
is, let there be nothing besides: as the Apostle saith of himselfe, he preached <hi>Christ</hi> and not himselfe, so we should doe every thing in <hi>sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity</hi> of heart. And so you should behave your selves in your elections, to looke with a single eye to the oath by which you ought to be guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: doe nothing for feare or favour of men, or for any sinister respect. I wish I could speake and give this rule to all the kingdome at Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament times. For it is an errour among men to thinke that in election of Burgesses or any others, they may pleasure their friends, or themselves, by having this or that eye to their owne advantage or disadvantage that may arise from it: whereas they ought to keep their mindes single and free from all respects; so that when they come, they may choose him, whom in their owne consciences, and in the sight of God, they thinke fittest for the place, and that you may doe so, you are to get a single and a <hi>simple</hi> heart to doe it.</p>

declaring to you the severall Attributes, which are given to him in Scripture, wee have passed through divers: The last Attribute was his <hi>Simplicity.</hi>

            <p>That which followes next in order is his <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability</hi> or <hi>Vnchangeablenesse.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The fifth Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of <hi>God</hi>; His Immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</note> Now that hee takes this proper to himselfe, you shall see in <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.19. GOD <hi>is not as man that he should lie, neither the sonne of man that hee should repent.</hi> Repenting, you know, is a signe of change; he <hi>will not repent,</hi> that is, he will not be subject to any change: whatsoever purpose or decree, or counsell he takes to him, hee is <hi>immutable</hi> in it. <hi>Shall he say, and not doe it? shall he speake, and not make it good?</hi> So <hi>Iames</hi> 1.17. <hi>Every good and perfect gift is from above, and commeth downe from the father of lights, with whom there is no variable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, nor shadow of turning.</hi> When the question was, whence temptations should arise; saith the Apostle, GOD tempts no man, for he is in himselfe just, good, and full of goodnesse, and he can never be otherwise, and therefore no temptation to evill can arise from him: and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is so, he must alwayes be so, for he is not changed, nay there is no shadow of change in him. So <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.6. <hi>I am the Lord, I change not.</hi> So that in this body of Divinity we doe but summe up divers heads, and so open them to you. This is an Attribute that he takes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and therefore we will explaine it to you. First, I will shew you the reasons why; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, an objection or two against it; and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:15479:140"/>
thirdly, I will shew you the consequences or uses that arise from it.</p>
            <p>Now to convince us fully of this point, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider these reasons.</p>
            <p>Because wheresoever there is any change,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.</note> there must be some vanity and imperfection; that all the creatures are subject to change, it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth from hence, that they are subject to some imperfection. Now that which is most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, cannot be subject to change; because in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very change, either there is some perfection added that before was wanting, or else some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is taken away which before was enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Now neither of these can befall our GOD, who is most perfect, nothing can be added or taken away from him; for if any thing could, he were not perfect: whence it must needes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that he is <hi>unchangeable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatsoever is changeable must be in a pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility either to receive some new being,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 2.</note> or some other being that it had not before, either in substance or in circumstance, or else it cannot be changeable: now that which is capable of no new being in any respect, nor other being in no circumstance, or accident, cannot be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Now GOD is exceeding full of being, as the sea is of water, and the Sunne of light, that is, he hath all the degrees and extensions of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him: therefore he is not in possibility of receiving any other being, than he hath; he is not subject to receive any other being, for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and no other being for quantity, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:15479:141"/>
therefore nothing can be added to his time or place where he is; neither can hee receive any other being for quality, no new habits, no new powers can be added to him; for if there could be, he should not be full of being, but there should be some defect in him; if there were any possibility in him of having any more: but see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is full of being, and constantly full, it cannot be that hee should be subject to any change; some other being must be added to him, or else taken from him; but seeing that cannot be, therefore he must needes be <hi>unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 3.</note>In regard of his simplicity; because, if there be nothing in him but what is himselfe, but what is his essence, unlesse his essence should be annihilated, (which is impossible) he is not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to change. Now all the creatures, besides their essence, have quantity in them, and that may be greater or lesse in the creature; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, they have quality, and therefore they may be better or worse: but <hi>God</hi> is great with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out quantity, and good without quality; and therefore in regard of his simplicity, seeing there is nothing in him, but what is himselfe, he cannot admit of any <hi>shadow of turning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 4.</note>Because he is infinite; you know, an infinite thing is that which extends it selfe, which fills all things, to which nothing can be added: and therefore seeing he is infinite at the utmost ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, hee cannot extend himselfe any further. Againe, nothing can be taken from him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:15479:141"/>
he should be changed; for, <hi>Infinitum est, cui nec addi, nec adimi potest:</hi> and therefore seeing he is most infinite, he is also <hi>unchangeable.</hi> For whatsoever is infinite, cannot be greater or les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, nothing can be added or taken from it: and therefore <hi>unchangeable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you observe it among the creatures,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 5.</note> you shall find, that all change ariseth from one of these two things; either from something with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, or else from some disposition within the creature: But in <hi>God</hi> there can be no change in either of these respects. Not from any thing without him, because he is the first and supreme being, therefore there is no being before him, that he should borrow any thing of; neither is there any being above him, or stronger than he, that should make any impression upon him. Againe, not from any thing within him; for when there is in any creature any change that ariseth from a principle within, there must needes be something to move, and to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; something to act and to suffer in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, else there can be no change: as mans body is subject to change, because there be divers principles within, of which something doth act, and something doth suffer, and so the body is subject to change, and moulders away: but in <hi>God</hi> there are not two things, there is not in him something to act, and something to suffer, and therefore he is not made up of such principles, as can admit any change within him. So then the conclusion stands sure, that hee can admit
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:15479:142" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of no change or variation within or without him: and so needes must be <hi>unchangeable.</hi>

               </label> GOD is said to doe all this, to come to us, and to goe from us, and to sanctifie them that were voide of sanctification: and as you say of the Sunne; you say, that the Sunne comes into the house, when it fils it with light, but when the windowes are shut, you say, the Sunne is gone; Yet the Sunne alters not, but the change is in regard of the house, It is said to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the house because of the light that comes into it, which before did not, but the Sunne it selfe is not altered: So in this case, the Holy Ghost sanctifies a man, GOD drawes neere to him in his comfortable presence, because there are some workes wrought in the heart, that before were not: GOD is not changed, but it is the man that suffers the change; he sees light now, that before was <hi>in darkenesse and in the shadow of death</hi>; he is said to be changed by reason of those operations that now are there, which before were not. So is it in <hi>Christs</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; there was a change in the humane nature that was assumed, which before was not: there was a worke done on the earth, which was not before: he put forth his power in his humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and exaltation, which before he did not: but yet he was the same, the change was in the creature, and not in him.</p>
            <p>Now we come to the consequences; which are two.</p>

               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:15479:143"/>
Scripture, wherein the <hi>Lord</hi> expresseth such a sollicitude for the death of sinners: as, <hi>Why will you die, O house of Israel?</hi> why will you not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and obey? And, <hi>As I live, saith the Lord, I desire not the death of a sinner.</hi> And, how am <hi>I prest under your abominations, even as a cart is pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with sheaves?</hi> And it is said, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.6. <hi>That the Lord was grieved at the heart,</hi> or it pained him at the heart, <hi>that hee had made man.</hi> All these kind of expressions (as it is evident from hence) are but attributed to GOD after the manner of men: not that hee is moved, for it cannot be, seeing he is unchangeable: whatsoever new ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents fall out in the world, hee is not stirred with them, he is not moved with any new affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: for if he were, he should be, as man is, changeable. But the meaning of those places is, to shew the infinite goodnesse of his nature, and the greatnesse of our sinnes: so that as men grieve much, when their wills are crossed, and when their worke is brought to nothing, how weary are they, when they strive long, and doe no good? So the LORD would expresse it to us thus, that wee might take notice, what the great provocations are, what the sinnes and faults are, wherewith we offend him from day to day, that we may know what they be, and what price to set upon those sinnes whereby we weary him from time to time.</p>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:15479:143"/>
joy which he hath from any thing, done either by the Angels or men, that he had it from all eternity; for if any thing were new in him, there should be a change: but now there being none, you must needes grant this, that they were in him from all eternity. So that all the workes of men and Angels be nothing to him, all the joy that he hath from them, hee had it from eternity.</p>
            <p>Againe, all the sinnes whereby evill men provoke him, and all the punishments that they suffer for sinne, it moves not him; but as when a glasse falls against the wall, the wall is not hurt, but the glasse is broken: so wicked men, they hurt themselves, but hee is not moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>Therefore hence observe, that GOD must needes be <hi>most holy, and righteous, and just in all his wayes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Whence 1. He must needs be righteous in all his wayes.</note> because there is neither love, nor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, nor griefe in him, nor joy, which should make crooked, or bend the rule of his will, or alter it in any action. Men are therefore unjust, because in all that they doe, there is something that bends their wills this way, or that way, they are capable of love, joy, griefe: but GOD, seeing he is capable of none of these, therefore he must needes be most just and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in all his workes. Therefore whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he doth, though thou seest no reason for it, yet justifie thou him in all; when thou seest him overthrowing the Churches, denying his grace to many thousands, and the like, yet doe thou
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:15479:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>
justifie him in all his wayes: because there is no griefe or trouble can come to him, as to the creature, therefore he must needes be <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all wayes, and righteous in all his workes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this be so, then this will also follow, that all the decrees, all the counsells, and all the acts of his will, that ever were in him, they were in him from all eternity: that is, there is not a vicissitude of counsells, thoughts and desires upon the passages of things in the world, as there is in men; for then he should be subject to change: For this is a sure rule, <hi>Whatsoever is under different termes, there is a change in it</hi>; he is now, that which he was not before: and if there were any instant, in which GOD should will one thing which he did not another time, hee should bee subject to change. Therefore looke backe to all eternity, in your imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; thoughts, as in the making of the world; all those acts, those counsels that he executed upon men, they were in him from everlasting.</p>

yeares after: but because many of them did see clearely that it was the will of GOD, they did see his miracles and his workes that hee had done amongst them, and yet because they still rebelled, <hi>he swore in his wrath, that they should never enter into his rest.</hi> It is a fearefull case, when GOD shall doe this, (as he doth it:) Even all you that heare me this day, there is a time, I am perswaded, when the <hi>Lord</hi> pronounceth such a decree upon such a man, saying, I have rejected him: yet no man sees it, no not he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but he comes to Church, and heares the word from day to day.

for their good: when they fast, I will not heare their cry; when they offer burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them, but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</hi> When the day of death comes, when the time of sickenesse and extremitie comes, then you will cry, and cry earnestly: but <hi>God</hi> shall say to you then, the time was, when I cryed to you by the Ministers, and you would not heare: nay, you slighted and mocked them, and you would not heare them, I will also <hi>mocke &amp; laugh at your destruction.

But if there were any such change, then thou maist comfort thy selfe;
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:15479:147"/>
for <hi>God</hi> is <hi>unchangeable,</hi> and this covenant, it is an <hi>everlasting covenant.</hi> Consider that it is every where called so: <hi>Isay</hi> 55.3. it is said to be an <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting covenant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isay. 55.3.</note> because it is founded upon <hi>the sure mercies of David: God</hi> gave <hi>Saul</hi> mercies as well as <hi>David, God</hi> tells him that he shall have the kingdome, if hee will walke in his wayes; but <hi>Saul</hi> started out of the wayes of <hi>God,</hi> and so <hi>God</hi> performed his part, but yet the covenant was broke, because <hi>Saul</hi> performed not his part. And as it was with <hi>Saul,</hi> so it was with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Israel</hi>; because they broke the covenant on their parts, <hi>God</hi> also broke his. <hi>David</hi> started out of the way, as well as <hi>Saul</hi>: but they were sure mercies that were promised him, for it was an <hi>everlasting covenant of mercy.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you must know this, that there is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold covenant: First, a <hi>single covenant,</hi> such as GOD makes with children when they are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised, which is this; If you will <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> and walke in my wayes, you shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: now if they breake the condition, GOD is freed, he is not bound any further. Secondly, a <hi>double covenant,</hi> to performe both parts; which is this; If you will <hi>believe,</hi> and <hi>repent,</hi> you shall be saved, and, I will give you an heart, and you shall <hi>repent,</hi> and <hi>believe,</hi> and be saved; I began the worke, and I will finish it: here is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a covenant on <hi>Gods</hi> part, to be our Father, but on our parts also, as in the other; but GOD doth not onely promise for his part, but makes a covenant to to inable us to performe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:15479:147"/>
on our part: and therefore it is called a <hi>double covenant.</hi> And it is impossible that this covenant should be broken, for then GOD should breake it himselfe, (for he is ingaged for both parts); and so be changeable, if hee should not give thee a <hi>new heart,</hi> and keepe thee from the first day of thy regeneration till death. Therefore it is an <hi>everlasting covenant,</hi> and the fruites of it are <hi>sure mercies</hi>; it is a <hi>double cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> and therefore cannot be changed. And it is called, <hi>Compassions that faile not:</hi> why are they called so? to shew the <hi>unchangeablenesse</hi> of this covenant.</p>
            <p>But you will say, what if I fall into sin? I will forgive them, saith the <hi>Lord.</hi> Oh, but lusts doe rebell, old lusts, and new: but, saith the <hi>Lord,</hi> I will mortifie them, and give you grace to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them. Oh, but grace is subject to decay: but I will renew it, saith GOD. If thy sinnes and lusts should exceede his mercies, then they should faile; but they cannot: and therefore they are called <hi>compassions that faile not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, consider this, that the covenant is made in <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> There are two <hi>Adams,</hi> he made a covenant with both: with the <hi>first A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> he made a covenant, as with the common roote of all mankinde; but <hi>Adam</hi> brake the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and so did all his members. But there is a <hi>second Adam,</hi> and all that are saved, are members of him as truely as wee are of the <hi>first Adam:</hi> and he kept the covenant, and therefore if he stand, they shall stand also.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:15479:148"/>Besides, consider that he makes this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant as to sonnes, and not as to servants. To the servant the Master saith; Doe my worke faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and thou shalt have thy wages, if not, I will turne thee out of my dores: but with his Sonne it is not so, <hi>hee abideth in the house for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>; if he fall into sinne, hee corrects and nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures him, but yet hee keepes him in his house for ever.</p>

It is a saying, <hi>Amare tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam aliquando osurus,</hi> is the very poyson of true friendship. But now, when thou knowest that <hi>God</hi> is knit to thee by an <hi>unchangeable</hi> bond, that hee is a friend whom thou maist build upon for ever, whom thou maist trust: this makes thy heart to cleave to him, as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>I know whom I have trusted,</hi> this makes thy heart to fasten up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and there is no scruple of love, which would be, if there were a possibility of change.</p>
            <p>Besides, what makes a man to depart from his profession?

For what end is it then to pray, to endeavour a change of life, or to repent, for if there be such

an unresistable decree past against mee, what hope is there?</p>
            <p>Before I come to a particular answere to this, I will premise these two things in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, you know, that in other things there is an <hi>unchangeable</hi> Decree,<note place="margin">That the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeablenes of Gods De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees takes not away endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</note> as there is an unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Decree concerning the time of mens death, and yet no man for this doth cease to eate, or to take Physicke: so there is an <hi>unchangeable</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree concerning the successe of every businesse under the Sunne, yet wee doe not forbeare to take counsell, and to use the best meanes to bring our enterprises to passe: And so there is an <hi>unchangeable</hi> Decree concerning the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of men, concerning giving grace, or denying grace to them; and you can no more take an argument from hence, to give over endeavours, than you can in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Though there be an <hi>unchangeable</hi> Decree past upon men, when GOD hath rejected them, and GOD will not alter it; yet this Decree is kept secret, and no man knowes it: therefore there is a dore of hope opened, to stirre up men to endeavour. Indeed if the Decree were made knowne, and revealed to us, then it were in vaine, then there were no place for endeavours: but seeing it is not so, therefore there is place for hope, and for endeavours which arise from hope.</p>
            <p>These things being premised, we will now
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:15479:150"/>
come to a particular answer of this objection.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, that if thou doest pray, thou shalt change GOD and his carriage toward thee, though hee be unchangeable. For if a man be rejected as <hi>Saul</hi> was, and as the <hi>Iewes</hi> were, and as those in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. who were <hi>given up to a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate minde</hi>; if he be so rejected, he is not able to pray, or repent, or to seeke to GOD or to desire to go about in good earnest to seeke any change of life: for if he were able to doe it, he was sure to speed. Therefore if thou doest pray in truth, thou shalt prevaile, thou art sure to have mercy at his hand; for it is a great signe that he hath not giuen thee over, that no such <hi>unchangeable</hi> decree is past against thee: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no doctrine of discouragement. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is a doctrine of great terrour to those, whose hearts doe not tremble at it, that let such a doctrine slide a way as water doth off a stone, and not sinke into threir hearts at all: but to a man that saith, I would repent, and pray, and change the course of my life, if there were any hope; I can say this to thee, that if thou doest pray thou shalt be accepted; for GOD hath stiled himselfe, that he is a GOD <hi>hearing praiers</hi>; and except he were changeable, he must needs be ready to heare thee, if thou seekest to him: For the <hi>Lord</hi> is <hi>unchangeable</hi> in his promises, &amp; thou shalt finde him <hi>unchangeable</hi> towards thee: but to a man that will not pray, that is set upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and will not be wrought upon, to such a man this is a fearefull and a terrible do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:15479:151"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, though GODS decree be <hi>unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> yet if thou canst find a change in thy selfe, it shall go well with thee: as if a father should take up an <hi>unchangeable</hi> resolution to disinherit a stubborne and ungracious child, because he is so; if the child should change now and alter his courses, and grow sober, the father may now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him to mercy, and yet no change in his resolution, but the change is in the sonne. Or, if a Prince should set downe in a law, (as a law of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> that alters not) saying, I will not receive to favour such a rebellious sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, because he is so: yet if his subject be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, he may receive him, and yet his Decree may be <hi>unchangeable,</hi> because the change was in the subject, and the decree was grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, if hee did remaine so rebellious and stubborne: So I say to thee, if GOD hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore threatned to reject thee, because thou art a stubborne and rebellious wretch, if now thou shalt finde a change in thy selfe, that thy stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne heart is broken, standing in awe of him, fearing to offend him, or to commit any sinne that thou knowest to be a sinne, I say, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that <hi>unchangeablenesse</hi> of his, he cannot but receive thee to mercy. As if a Physitian should take up an unchangeable resolution, not to give his patient such restorative physicke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his stomacke is foule, so that it will not worke, and because he will not receive such pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations whereby he should be prepared for it: But if there be a change in him, if his stomacke
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:15479:151"/>
be cleane &amp; fit for it, so that it will work, and he become willing to receive it, if hee give it him, the change is not in the Physitian, but in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. Therefore when you heare this, sit not downe discouraged, but rather goe and sit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and consider of thy sinnes, and give not over till thy heart be broken for them: and when this is done, be sure that he will receive thee to mercy, for he may be unchangeable in his decree, if the change be in thee. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Doctrine doth not discourage, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther stirre up, and incite men to change their courses, yea it is the very scope of it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Againe, I adde this further; he that saith, to what purpose is it to endeavour, whosoever it is that sayes so, I would aske that man this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion; Didst thou ever goe about any holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and yet didst finde this stoppe in it, that though thou wouldest doe them, thou couldest not be accepted? hadst thou ever a serious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to forsake such and such a sinne, and the occasions of it, and yet thou didst finde such a barre as this, that thou couldest not alter GODS decree thereby, and for that onely reason hast gone on in it? Did ever any man upon his death-bed say so? No man will say so: but it is because he would not. Therefore complaine not of the <hi>unchangeable</hi> decree of GOD, but of the stubbornesse of thy heart, that thou wilt not buckle, and come in unto him.</p>
            <p>The best way in this Doctrine of the <hi>unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geablenesse</hi> of <hi>Gods</hi> decree of election, is this: It
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:15479:152"/>
is good to consider in what manner it is delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Scripture, and to what purpose, and to make that use of it, and then thou shalt be sure not to abuse it. As for example; to what end, and for what occasion is this Doctrine of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction delivered? You shall finde that it is on this occasion. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.18, 19. When many of the <hi>Iewes</hi> did not come in, to whom did belong the <hi>covenant, and the lawes, and the testimonies,</hi> this was an objection that was made against the Doctrine of the Gospell; what was the reason that the <hi>Iewes</hi> did not come in, and that his owne people were not wrought upon? To an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere this objection, the Apostle tells them, that it was not against <hi>Gods</hi> good will, hee was able to doe it, if it was his pleasure, but, saith he, some hath hee chosen, and some not; some hee loves, and some hee hates; some hee hath mercy upon, and some he hardens. So that the scope of the Doctrine is, that <hi>God</hi> might be magnified, that no objection might be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the almighty power of GOD, that hee was not able to bring them in, that men might not say that they have resisted his will: and the Apostle reveales it for that purpose, that men might be answered. So that such Doctrines as this, you must consider for what end they are revealed. As for this Doctrine of <hi>Gods un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeablenesse,</hi> what is the end, why it is revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led? You shall see in <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.19. <hi>He is not as man that he should repent: Therefore I have blessed Israel, and he shall be blessed.</hi> The end is, to shew
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:15479:152"/>
that his favour is an <hi>unchangeable</hi> favour: So he hath cursed <hi>Saul,</hi> and he shall be cursed, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.29. his decrees are unalterable. As it is <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.17. GOD is good, and cannot be otherwise, therefore he <hi>can tempt no man.</hi> Out of all these places it is apparant, that the use of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is, that we might tremble at his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and that we might rejoyce in his favour with joy unspeakable and glorious: In a word, that men might know the excellency of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and might know and magnifie GOD, because constancy and unchangeablenesse is a property of wisedome. This being the end why it is revealed, it ought to be applied onely to this use: as to come to particulars, which before we did not mention. When we heare that GOD rejected <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>will not repent</hi> of it, and the <hi>Iewes,</hi> &amp;c. the use that we should make of it is this; If GOD should passe such a decree of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection upon me, it cannot be changed; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would feare before him, and take heede of that stubbornesse and course of disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that may bring that curse upon me, and such a stroke upon my soule; and for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is this doctrine revealed to us. And this use the Apostle makes of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. when he had delivered <hi>Gods unchangeable</hi> decree, declared by his <hi>swearing in his wrath, that they should never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his rest:</hi> therefore deferre not, saith he, <hi>while it is called to day,</hi> lest that you continuing in a course of rebellion, the doore of mercy be shut upon you, and GOD doe <hi>sweare in his
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:15479:153"/>
wrath,</hi> as he did to them, <hi>that you shall never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his rest.</hi> Beloved, there is a double time: a time of the comming forth of this decree, and a time of preparing and trying, while the doore stands open. Therefore take heede that that <hi>acceptable time</hi> doe not passe away, lest thou be <hi>hardened through the deceitfulnesse of sinne.</hi>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>3</label> If GOD be <hi>unchangeable,</hi> then looke what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever hee hath done in former times,<note place="margin">We shall finde God the same in dispensing iudgements &amp; mercies in these times to us that he hath beene in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times to them.</note> what judgements hee hath inflicted, and for what, what mercies hee hath shewen, and upon what ground; and thou maist expect the same, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no change in him: therefore goe over all the Scripture, and beholde what hee hath done there, looke through all thine owne experience, &amp; see what he hath done to thee, &amp; to others, &amp; know that he will doe the same to thee, for he is <hi>unchangable.</hi> As for example, look what he did to <hi>Ioab, Shimei,</hi> and the house of <hi>Saul.</hi> You know the sinnes that they commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; <hi>Ioab</hi> had committed murther, and <hi>Shimei</hi> reviled <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> slew the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his oath: though they went on a long time in peace and prosperity, yet because their pardon was not sued out, therefore after many yeares <hi>God</hi> called them to an account. As <hi>Ioab</hi> went not to the grave in peace, and <hi>Shimei</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served death, and therefore it was brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; and <hi>Saul</hi> was punished in the blood of his sonnes, and hee was slaine himselfe, as hee had slaine others in battell. So be thou assured, if there be any sinne which thou hast formerly
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:15479:153"/>
committed, unrepented of, though it be long since, GOD will waken it in due time. So, looke what he did to <hi>David</hi>; hee had committed a sinne in secret, but the <hi>Lord</hi> saith, that hee will make his punishment to be open, he will doe it <hi>before the Sunne:</hi> So if thou hast committed a sinne in secret, take heede lest hee bring it to light, he will doe to thee, as he did to <hi>David</hi>; and I say unto thee, that though thou be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, and art one of his elect, yet if thy case be the same with <hi>Davids,</hi> hee will doe so to thee, for hee is <hi>unchangeable.</hi> There be two cases wherein the <hi>Lord</hi> will not spare, but bring judgement upon his owne children.<note place="margin">Two cases wherein God will punish his owne.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
            </p>
            <p>First, in the case of scandall, as <hi>Davids</hi> was: for though his first sinne was secret, yet his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was publicke, and made the first so too. Therfore though his sin was forgiven him, <hi>God</hi> tells him that his punishment should be open, and that <hi>the sword should not depart from his house.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, if their sinne be not scandalous, yet if it be unrepented of, GOD will even pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish his owne children. And as GOD deales with secret sinnes to bring them to light: so he will doe with secret innocency, on the other side also. As <hi>Ioseph,</hi> whose uprightnesse was in secret, for none did see it but himselfe; as for his Mistresse, she accused him, and was belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: yet the <hi>Lord</hi> brought it to light in due sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. So he will doe thine. Let men keepe their credit with GOD, and he will keepe their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with men, let them raise slanders, or what
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:15479:154"/>
they will: looke how he did with <hi>Ioseph,</hi> so he will deale with thee, for he changeth not.</p>
            <p>So looke how the <hi>Lord</hi> hath dealt with wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men; looke how the <hi>Lord</hi> did deale with them that did meddle with holy things, as <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab,</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> and <hi>Vzzah,</hi> and the <hi>Bethshemites</hi>; you know that he destroyed them all, and that with a present destruction: so if thou wilt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse his name, abuse his holy things, and come unto the Sacraments with an <hi>uncircumcised heart,</hi> he is the same <hi>God</hi> still, hee is as much offended now, and hee is as ready to execute his wrath upon thee, as he was then.</p>
            <p>So looke how hee dealt with <hi>Saul,</hi> with the <hi>Iewes</hi> that came out of <hi>Egypt, hee swore in his wrath, that they should not enter his rest:</hi> if thou wilt doe the same that they did, rebell against him as they did, he will <hi>sweare in his wrath, that thou shalt never enter into his rest.</hi> As hee passed his sentence upon <hi>Saul,</hi> and as hee passeth his sentence upon any: so he will bring it to passe, if thy case be the same, for he is <hi>unchangeable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So looke how hee did deale in <hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> time, and as it was with them, <hi>Now the axe is laid to the roote of the tree,</hi> when the Gospell, and the meanes of grace, and the spring-time of the word began; because they did not regard it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they were cast off: the time of their ignorance <hi>God</hi> regards not so much; but then hee called upon every one to repent, and because they did not come in then, hee deferred not his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That upon which I ground this, you
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:15479:154"/>
shall finde in two places of Scripture. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. If the LORD did so with the Angels, <hi>spared not them,</hi> saith he, he is the same GOD, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee knowes how to <hi>reserve the unjust to the day of judgement,</hi> and especially <hi>those that are uncleane:</hi> the ground of it is his <hi>unchangeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> The other place is in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. You know what he did to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> saith hee, hee will doe the same to you: therefore doe you take heede, that you <hi>doe not commit fornication, as some of them committed, and died in the wildernesse, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Onely here is this caution diligently to be remembred, which we must adde to all this that hath beene spoken.<note place="margin">A caution added.</note> It is sure, that whensoever it is the same case, hee will doe the same thing: though his judgements are different, the time different, the wayes and meanes are different.</p>
            <p>As for example, he stroke <hi>Vzzah</hi> presently, and so he did <hi>Gebazi,</hi> and <hi>Nadab,</hi> and <hi>Abibu</hi>; yet to others there may be difference in time: to these he did it presently, to others it may be he will doe it many yeares after. Againe, he stroke them with death, but it may be there is another kinde of judgement reserved for thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it may be he will give thee up to hardnesse of heart, or the like.</p>
            <p>Againe, so it is in shewing mercy, for the rule is as true therein also: For he shewes mercy to some this way, and to others that way, and he humbles men after divers manners; and so some men hee punisheth for their sinnes in this life, some hee reserves for another world: Againe,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:15479:155"/>
some hee strikes presently, and some hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beares with much patience.</p>
            <p>And this you must remember in both these, that though hee doth the same things, yet hee doth them in a different manner, time, and way: he hath divers judgements, and afflictions; and as there are divers meanes to attaine to the same end, as some may ride, some go on foot, and yet all come to one journeys end: So the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and afflictions may be different, yet the end the same; and that this caution being taken in, thou maist be sure, that the same judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that he did execute in former time, he is ready to execute them still. As he hath given them up to open sinnes, that did neglect him in secret, so he will doe to thee; as he hath stric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken some men in their sinnes, so the same wrath is gone out against and remaines for thee, if thou doe not repent and turne to him: for the kindes, as whether by sicknesse, or death, &amp;c. these we cannot determine of; the wayes of GOD are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and exceding divers, unsearchable, and past finding out: but though in regard of his particular wayes it doth not follow, he did thus to this man, therfore he will doe the very same to thee; yet because he did this to them, he will doe the same thing to thee in the same or in a different manner.</p>
            <p>So looke what he hath done to all his Saints, hee hath blessed them, and heard them. But thou wilt say, I have prayed, and I am not heard. I say to thee, if thy case be the same,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:15479:155"/>
thou shalt be heard. To this end are those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: <hi>The Lords hand is not shortened,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay 59.1.</note> 
               <hi>that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not save, nor his eare heavie, that it cannot heare:</hi> This is the scope of the Prophet; as if he should say, you wonder why you are not heard, that you have not the same successe in prayer that they had, but the case is not the same, saith he: they repented, but you doe not; you are mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, for you are yet in your sinnes; I am as strong to helpe you, and as ready, and if I doe it not, it is because the case is different: <hi>your sins have made a separation betweene me and you.</hi> Which implies, that GOD will heare if the case be the same. Onely remember this, that GOD may deferre it something long before he heares you, yet he will doe it in the end.</p>

            <p>There be diverse branches of this use:<note place="margin">Containes two branches.</note> As,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First if this be so, then every creature is, and must be changeable, and if so, then take heed, that you doe not expect more of the creature,<note place="margin">Looke on the creatures as mutable, and expect not much from them.</note> then is in it, for this will raise our affections to the creature, and so cause griefe and vexation in the end: and indeede the forgetfulnesse of this changeablenesse in the creature, and unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenesse in GOD is the cause of all our crosses and sorrow in outward things we meet with. There be these degrees to it.</p>
            <p>For, first, The forgetfulnesse of the mutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:15479:156"/>
of the creature causeth us to expect more from it then is in it. Secondly, This expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on raiseth our affections unto the creature: hence it is, that we set our affections too much vpon them, and delight too much in them. Thirdly, Strong affections, when they are set vpon the creature, doe alwayes bring forth strong afflictions: for what is the reason of all the griefe, that we undergoe from day to day? Is it not, because our affections are set upon changeable objects, vpon the creatures? And therefore when they are changed, then there is a change in the mind: whereas if thou didst looke alone upon the <hi>unchangeable</hi> GOD, this would keepe thee from worldly care and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, this would preserve in thee evenesse and aequability of minde. Therefore take heed of forgetting this, that to be <hi>unchangeable,</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to <hi>God</hi> alone; Therfore set thy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vpon none but him: and if thou wilt doe so, thou shalt allwayes injoy a constant securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of mind, as if a man were in the uppper regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where there is no change of weather, when as belowe here, there is one day foule, another faire; so that if a man could live with GOD, and walke with him, and have his conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in heaven, he should not be subject to such change: whereas if a man set his minde upon earthly things, he shall be still subject to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations and unevenesse. All griefe of mind comes from hence, that thou lookest for <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeablenesse</hi> from the creature, where it is not to be had. If thou wouldest looke up to <hi>God,</hi>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:15479:156"/>
thou shalt find all things a like there, there is no change with him. When an earthen pot is broken, it doth not much trouble you, for you remember it to be but an earthen pot: now e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing here below, all your friends, wife, children, they are but earthen vessels, and the consideration of this would exceedingly helpe you, if you would settle it on your heart. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore say, what a foole was I? I did not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, they were but a flower, a vapour, and a shadow: for so the Scripture calls them. And shall a man take on, because a vapour is scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and a flower withered, and a shadow va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished? Therefore remember, that to bee <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable</hi> is proper to <hi>God</hi> alone: and to be changeable is as proper to the creature, as to him to be <hi>immutable.</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, You may see from hence, how to helpe that vanity to which the creature is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:<note place="margin">Goe to <hi>God</hi> to put a stability into the things thou enioyest.</note> for if <hi>unchangeablenesse</hi> be the property of <hi>God,</hi> thou must not seeke a stabilitie from the creature, but consider that it hath no further in it, then <hi>God</hi> is pleased to communicate the same to it. Therefore to goe to him to whom <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeablenesse</hi> belongs: for as mutable as they be, yet if he will make thy freinds to be stable, or thy wealth, it shall be so. Therefore the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way is, to goe to him, to make those things firme, which otherwise are unconstant. The love of a freind is unconstant, for hee may dye, <hi>the breath is in his nostrils,</hi> and if he doe live, <hi>yet his thoughts may perish,</hi> and his affections alter: So that they shall faile thee as a <hi>land floud doth
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:15479:157"/>
in summer,</hi> as <hi>Iob</hi> saith. It dries up in summer time, and yet that is the time of thirst; and so will they faile thee in time of neede: and the like may be said of all things else, so that he whose comfort doth depend upon them, hath but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent felicity, which is like the motion of mills, and ships, which cease when the water or wind failes them. But yet as mutable as they are, <hi>God</hi> can put a constancy unto them. Apply this therefore to thy selfe. Thou livest now, and art in health and wealth, in such and such a place, and such circumstances as may continue it: the onely way to establish thee in all this is, to goe to <hi>God,</hi> and to beseech him to put a stabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie into thy condition. For the creature, as it is made of nothing, and is built upon a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nothing: So it is apt to returne to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And remember this, that the more reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and weaned, and fearefull thy affections are about any thing, so that thou canst say in good earnest; If <hi>God</hi> will, I shall injoy them to day, and next day, but his will I know not, I know not how long I shall injoy them; if thou canst say thus, thou shalt hold them the longer, and the faster: for that is a signe that thou depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est upon <hi>God,</hi> and not not on the creature, that thou trustest him, and art not fastened to it.</p>

it: looke how changeable it is, so much the worse it is; if it be good, the more <hi>immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,</hi> the better it is, for all changeablenesse commeth from weakenesse. Therefore learne to value it so: and you shall finde this of much use. As we may see in the heavens: it is said that they are vaine, <hi>because they waxe olde as doth a garment, but thou art the same, Psal.</hi> 102.26, 27. Go through every thing glorious in the world, glorious Churches, they are subject to change; as <hi>Ierusalem, the glory of all the earth,</hi> it is ruina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and brought nothing. Take men that are most eminent, yet because they are subject to change, by death or by passions, there is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evennesse in them: though they live here like Gods in their glory. Therefore magnifie no man, but labour to be perswaded of thy selfe, as a man. I need not speake to you of riches, they take to themselves wings and fly away; nor of credit and honour, they are in the power of them that give them: whatsoever is changea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, according to the mutability of it, so value it. But I presse the contrary. Looke upon the things that are not changeable, and labour to prize them. Thou shalt find saving grace to be <hi>unchangeable,</hi> though it may be impared in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and may recoyle to the root, and may not bud forth as at other times, yet it is <hi>unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> it shall never be taken away: So spir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>uall life is <hi>unchangeable,</hi> when that begins, then the other shakes off, even as old nailes doe; when new grow under them: therefore this should
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:15479:158"/>
teach us to value it much.</p>
            <p>So the word of GOD is an <hi>unchangeable</hi> thing, <hi>Isay</hi> 40.8. <hi>The grasse withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of the Lord shall stand for ever.</hi> So <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. <hi>Heaven and earth shall passe away, but my word shall not passe.</hi> Now what use should we make of this? Then study the word more than any thing in the world besides. There is much learning in the world, and there are many creatures: now all other knowledge is of the creature, and that vanisheth away with them, but <hi>the word of God shall not passe, the word indures for ever.</hi> Therefore looke what truthes thou canst get out of the word, which may build up the inward man, looke what profit thou canst get from it, that shall remaine for ever: therefore thou shouldest prize it much, get it plenteously in thy heart, in the wisedome and power of it. We have many imployments in this life: but that which is bestowed upon <hi>unchangeable</hi> things, which shall shall never al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that is the best time spent.</p>
            <p>Lastly, all the good workes thou doest, and all the evill workes of unregenerate men unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of, shall remaine for ever. Looke what good workes thou doest in the world, they shall remaine with thee for ever, they shall be had in continuall remembrance. Therefore thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest labour to be abundant in good workes, that is, to be sure to serve GOD whatsoever thou doest. If thou be servant or a labouring man; when thou doest thy workes out of obedience
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:15479:158"/>
to him, even those workes shall remaine. So looke in any thing that thou hast done for <hi>Christ,</hi> all these things shall remaine for ever: what faithfull prayers soever thou hast made, or whatsoever thou hast suffered for <hi>Christ,</hi> what paines thou hast taken in preaching, or in repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or in advancing the cause of CHRIST, these shall be had in everlasting remembrance. So looke what sinnes unrepented of thou hast committed. The sinnes of unregenerate men shall also remaine. All the praise that comes from any action, and the pleasure of it, that passeth away, and comes to nothing: but looke what sinfulnesse there is in any worke, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, and if thou repent not of it, that sinne shall be reckoned upon thy score; and what uprightnesse soever there is in any worke, that shall remaine. Therefore learne from hence to prize and value onely those good things that are immutable, and proportionably to feare and shunne the evill.</p>

If a man would make a censure of himselfe, let
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:15479:160"/>
him consider, that the nearer hee comes to <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeablenesse</hi> in well-doing, the better he is, and the stronger he is: againe, the more muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the weaker. Thou art to judge of thy selfe, as we use to esteeme of one another. Now let a man be unconstant, one that we can have no holde of, that is as fickle as the weather, that will resolve upon such a thing to day, and change his minde to morrow: what ever lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or excellency, or what kindnesse soever there is in this man, we regard him not, because he is an unconstant man. Now learne thou to doe so with thy selfe, to aske thy selfe that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: Hast thou not had many resolutions, that never came to any endeavours? Hast thou not begun many good workes, and never finished them? Hast thou not found that property of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in thee, To begin stil to live? <hi>Stultitia semper incipit vivere?</hi> If this be thy case, learne to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre thy selfe for it, and to be ashamed: for all is nothing, till we come to a constant and <hi>unchangeble</hi> resolution: So that we come to set it downe with our selves as an inviolable law: this is a duty, and I will doe it, whatsoever it cost me; this is a sinne, and I will avoid it, whatsoever come of it. This is a resolution that <hi>Daniel</hi> takes up, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1.8. <hi>He determined in his heart,</hi> that he would not <hi>be defiled with the Kings meate:</hi> and such a resolution they were exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to in <hi>Acts</hi> 11.23. <hi>With full purpose of heart, to cleave unto God.</hi> It is translated, full purpose: but the words are, with a decree and full reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution

               </gap>: That is, when a man doth not lightly put himselfe upon an holy course; but takes up a strong resolution to goe through with it; such a resolution as <hi>Pauls</hi> was, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.22. he knew what bands did waite for him, as for theeves it was no matter, he <hi>was bound in the spirit,</hi> All is nothng: I care not, sayes he, <hi>so that I may fulfill the Ministery committed to me.</hi> Such a resolution we should have.

A man that is on and off in his wayes, <hi>Salomon</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares him to a City whose walls are broken downe, that is, if a temptation come, and set upon him, it hath free entrance, and the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation comes in, because his soule was without guard and ward. But on the other side, a man that doth not stand trifling with the <hi>Lord,</hi> to say, I wish I could, and I am sorry that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, but he will goe through a good course, such a man is like to a City which hath walls round about it; that if a temptation come, there is something to keepe it out. I say, as thou art to judge of other things by the mutability of them: so of thy selfe.

selfe <hi>unchangeable,</hi> and <hi>immutable</hi> and constant in well-doing. For, for what end hath he revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to us that he is <hi>unchangeable?</hi> is it not for our use? Sure it is, even to teach us, that when we finde our selves subject to mutability, wee should goe to <hi>God,</hi> and beseech him to establish our hearts. No creature is able to doe it. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very creature is mutable, onely so farre <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable,</hi> as he maketh it to be so; he onely is originally <hi>unchangeable</hi>; all friends and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things in the world are no further <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable</hi> than he communicates it to them, (as was said before:) and the same is true of thine owne heart, and of thy purposes. Therefore thou must thinke with thy selfe, and make this use of the <hi>unchangeablenesse</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that hee onely can make thee <hi>unchangeable.</hi> Therefore when a man wants direction, hee must goe to GOD: <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.5. he is onely wise, and can shew a man what to doe, when he is in a strait. And upon the same ground when thou seest that thou art un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant, goe to him that is <hi>unchangeable,</hi> that can make thee constant; and desire him to fixe thy quicke-silver, to ballance thy lightnesse, and that he would settle and fill that vaine and empty heart of thine with something that may stay and establish it. There is no other way: all the meanes that can be used, all the motives that can be put upon a man, all the reasons that can be brought, are not able to make us constant, till GOD worke it in us, and for us. Therefore the onely way is to give GOD the glory of his
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:15479:161"/>
               <hi>immutability,</hi> to goe to him in a sense of thine owne unconstancy, and say so; <hi>Lord,</hi> thou hast revealed thy selfe to be <hi>unchangeable,</hi> that wee may seeke it of thee, and finde it in thee, thou alone art originally and essentially so: no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is any further than thou doest communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it to it. Therefore doe thou, LORD, make mee stable and constant in well-doing. Grace it selfe of it selfe is not <hi>immutable,</hi> for it is subject to ebbing and flowing: and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why we doe not quite lose it, is not from the nature of grace, as if it were <hi>immutable,</hi> but because it comes from and stickes close to Christ.

               </label> It is true, he doth it by meanes: and if you say, what are those meanes? I will shew it you briefly.</p>
            <p>You shall finde that there two causes of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy,<note place="margin">Two causes of inconstancy, and two means to procure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy.</note> or mutability, or ficklenesse: and if you finde out what the causes are, you will easily see the way to helpe it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, Strength of lust: that causeth men to be unconstant. <hi>Iames</hi> 4.8.<note place="margin">Lusts get them mortified.</note>
               <note place="margin">Iam: 4.8.</note> 
               <hi>Cleanse your hands, ye sinners, and purge your heart you wavering-minded:</hi> what is the reason, that the Apostle bids them to <hi>purge their hearts,</hi> that were <hi>wavering-minded,</hi>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:15479:162"/>
but because that corruption, and those unruly affections that are within, cause us to be uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, to waver, even as an arrow shot with a strong hand, that the winde makes to fly uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly: so a man that resolves upon a good course, and takes to himselfe good purposes and desires, he having some lust in him, these thrust in, and make him unstable; therefore purge your hearts you wavering-minded. As if he should say, the reason why you are not stable, is, because you are not cleansed from these corruptions, which are the cause of this unconstancy. So <hi>Psal.</hi> 5.9. <hi>There is no faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse in their mouth, their inward part is very fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse, &amp;c.</hi> The reason why there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie in their speech, life, and actions is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause within they are very corruption: that is, the sinne that is within, is the cause of all the wavering that is in the life of man; were it not for it, there would be no such unevennesse in our lives. Therefore if this be the cause of it, there is no way to helpe it, but to get this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption mortified, to be cleansed from all pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of flesh and spirit, as much as may be.</p>
            <p>Take a man that sayes hee will amend his course, that intends to be diligent in his calling, and thinkes not to turne to such evill courses, but to serve <hi>God</hi> with a perfect heart: observe now what is the reason that this man breakes his purposes, and falls off againe; it is, because there is some strong lust, that comes like a gust of a contrary winde, and breakes him off from
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:15479:162"/>
his course. Therefore the first way is, to cleanse thy heart, if thou wilt be constant.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second cause of unconstancy, is weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; <note place="margin">Vnconstancy comes from weaknesse.</note> if a man were free from that inward cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, yet weakenesse would make a man to bee unconstant: so much weakenesse, so much unconstancy; and so much strength as a man hath, so much constancy he hath. For what is the reason that man is so fickle? Because the banks of his resolution are so weak to hold out against temptations when they assault him, &amp; he giues over because he is not able to resist them. And this ground I take out of 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.29. <hi>The strength of Israel will not repent, for he is not as man that hee should repent.</hi> By repenting is meant a change: now you see the reason given why the Lord is not subject to change, he is <hi>the strength of Israell.</hi> For you shall allwayes finde in the Scripture, that such attributes are given to GOD, according to the nature of the worke that he hath in hand: Now the reason why the Lord will not repent is, because he is strong.</p>
            <p>To make this appeare to you,<note place="margin">Three helpes to strengthen purposes.</note> you must know, that three things must concurre to make a resolution strong.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, there must bee some reason that must move him.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, there must bee an inclination of the will to it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, It must be often renewed. First, I say, there must be some reason that must move him: but if that were all, he would not resolue,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:15479:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>
therefore hee must have an inclination of the will to it; both these, when they concurre, they make the resolution up: when the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is convinced, and the will inclined, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding saith there is reason for it, and the will saith, it is good, then this makes up the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution. As first, when a man hath any reason to move him to any action, and it is a strong reason, so that hee answers all objections that hee meets with, now the resolution continues firme: but if his reasons be not sufficient, but he meete with objections that are stronger, then the first principle being taken away, the reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution growes flaggy and weake. And so is it in the other also, when a man hath a desire to any thing, if it be so strong, that nothing is stronger then it, that can overtop, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule it, then he goes on without any impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but if it bee weake, so that a stronger desire can come, and overballance it, then the second principle is demolished, and there is an end of this resolution. So that let the reason on which wee fixe it bee strong, and let the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination (which must concurre,) be fix't and strong, and then the resolution will be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didg.</p>
            <p>But I adde the third, that there must be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of this: for though the resolution bee well built, yet to make it constant, it must still be renewed. For there are some workes, which must have a third and fourth hand to goe over them, or else they will fall, and moulder away:
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:15479:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And this is the nature of our resolution also, it is not the resolution of a day or two, that will serue the turne, for the nature of man is subject to such weakenesse, that except our resolutions bee gone over and over againe, they shrinke and come to nothing. Therefore the thing that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth unconstancy, is one of these three: either weakenesse of reason that sets thee on worke, or weakenesse of the inclination and desire, or else, not renewing of this. Now when you have found out the causes of weaknesse, you may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily finde out the meanes to make you resolute in well doing. As</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, Labour to get strong reasons for what you resolve on. The want of this was the cause of the mutability of the second ground. <hi>It wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted depth of earth:</hi> that is, the seed was good, and the earth was good, but it was not deepe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough, and the strength of the Sunne caused it to wither away. So when we shall have good purposes and resolutions, and they have not root inough, that is, when he hath not well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined the thing, so as to bee fully convinced of the thing that he undertakes, he is apt to be inconstant in it. And this was the reason of <hi>Eves</hi> inconstancy, because shee considered not the bottome that she was built upon. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, the Woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> when she had fixed her faith upon a good ground, she would not be beaten off: though she could not answer the objection, yet she would not bee plucked off. Thou art the <hi>Messias,</hi> and therefore thou
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:15479:164" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wilt shew mercy: and then she had neede of mercy, for her daughter was sicke, and weake, and therefore she would not be driven off, shee would take no deniall. So is it with all our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions when they have this depth of earth. Therefore the best way is, to consider, and forecast the worst. So our Saviour counselleth to suspect the worst: <hi>How canst thou that hast but two hundred, goe against him that hath a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,</hi> so is it in this case. When you shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake a good course, and you goe out but with weake reasons: if Sathan or a lust come and object stronger reasons, this will make thee give out. Therefore the best way is to forecast the worst, and to outbid the Devill in every temptation. Therefore when hee shall come and say, that thou shalt have favour with men, say to him that the favour of GOD is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; if he shall tell thee of riches, and wealth, say that thou shalt have a treasure in heaven: if hee say to thee that thou shalt have rest and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in sinne, say to him, that the peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and joy in the Holy Ghost, is farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that rest, and pleasure, whatsoever it be: So in all the temptations one the other hand, it is good to ponder them well, that wee may bee able to outbid him therein. Whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he doth object, it is one of these two: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther some good that thou shalt have, or some e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill. Now consider, that as the love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of GOD, is a greater good then all the world can give thee: So his wrath is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               </label> There is no way in the world but this: La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be humbled for thy sinnes, to get a broken heart for them: for then a man comes to prize grace exceeding much, and worldly things as nothing. For this is a sure rule, <hi>When thou feelest thy sinnes to lie heavie upon thee, then all the things in the world will appeare light:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore labour to know the bitternesse of sinne; it is that which sets an edge upon all our spirituall desires: without this a man doth but cheapen the kingdome of heaven, he doth as the people did with <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> they expostulated with him about their serving him: so wee doe capitulate with the <hi>Lord,</hi> as it were, and stand upon termes with him, untill we are humbled; and then we are ready to take heaven upon any condition. Till a man be thus humbled, his desires are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse, and weake, and flaggy desires; they raise up great buildings upon no foundation; the foundation is weake and crazie, and so the building comes downe. And hence is it, that men <hi>put their hand to the plough, and looke backe againe.</hi> A scholler will serve the <hi>Lord,</hi> if hee may have eminency in gifts, and outward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, or some honour in the flesh; but all

this while his desires are remisse: but when he is once humbled, then he will say with Saint <hi>Paul, Lord, what wilt thou have me to doe?</hi> and I will doe it, whatsoever it is, and whatsoever thou wouldest have me to suffer, I will suffer it. <hi>He will take the kingdome of heaven by violence:</hi> and then his resolutions continue constant that way. For what can Satan do to him? wil he take away his pleasure from him, his wealth, or his credit? they are things that hee hath despised before: he can take nothing from him, but what he cares not for. It is the bitternesse of sinne, that makes him now to prize <hi>Gods</hi> love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour above all thing.</p>

So thou shouldest doe with thy heart: observe it from day to day, marke what obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions come, that thou canst not answer, what lusts and desires doe overballance thee, and learne still to renew thy reasons and resolutions against them: and this will make thee constant, and firme, and peremptory in well-doing.</p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The reasons of this <hi>Infinitenesse</hi> are these. </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, from this very place,<note place="margin">Proved by 4 Reasons.</note> 
               <hi>I AM hath sent me unto you; I AM,</hi> shewes that he hath a being from himselfe, if so, then he had no cause. Now from hence, as in that he had no <hi>efficient</hi> nor <hi>finall cause,</hi> he is eternall: so in that he hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>matter</hi> nor <hi>forme,</hi> hee is <hi>infinite</hi> and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:15479:168"/>
And that is the reason that hee hath an unlimited essence, because all limitation proceedes either from the <hi>matter</hi> or from the <hi>forme:</hi> the <hi>forme</hi> is contracted by the <hi>matter</hi>: againe, the <hi>matter</hi> would be indefinite, but it is contracted and bounded by the <hi>forme.</hi> Now GOD hath neither <hi>matter</hi> nor <hi>forme,</hi> nor no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like it: therefore hee is infinite. All the creatures they have their severall kindes: the Angels they have no <hi>matter,</hi> yet they have something in them answerable to <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>forme,</hi> wherein they agree, and disagree with other creatures: and therefore they are one kinde of creatures, and man another; which shewes that they have <hi>formes</hi> to bound and limit them, and that the essence of the Angels goes so farre, and no farther; and so the essence of man, &amp;c. But in GOD there is no similitude of any such thing, there is no <hi>Esse receptum,</hi> there is no limits in him, nothing to binde his essence: whereas they are <hi>Entia</hi> in a certaine kinde, he is <hi>simpliciter Ens,</hi> and therefore without all limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and so must be <hi>immense.</hi>

If he have an <hi>infinite</hi> power, it must needs proceede from an <hi>infinite</hi> cause; for <hi>as a thing is in working, so it is in being:</hi> therefore when his power is <hi>infinite,</hi> that must needes be <hi>infinite</hi> in which it is rooted, and from whence it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes.</p>

can conceive is <hi>infinite:</hi> but GOD is so, for if any thing could be imagined more perfect than he is, that should be GOD and not he: and therefore in Scripture, whatsoever we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of him, yet he is beyond it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>His wayes are past finding out</hi>; and it is said, that <hi>hee dwells in light inaccessible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Consider it from his workes: you see that hee hath made the world of nothing.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 4.</note> Whence I reason: If you would heate the aire, it is more easily heated than water, because the passive power is neerer the active; and if you would heate water, you may more easily heate it than the earth: Now according to the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, according to the passive power, such is the active: if the passive power lie open, the active power is lesse, that workes upon it: now when the passive power is <hi>infinitely</hi> low, then the active power must be <hi>infinitely</hi> high, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to it. Therefore when GOD comes to make something of nothing, the active po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer must bee exceeding high, because the passive power is so low: and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quires an <hi>infinite</hi> active power to make some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of nothing, and consequently, hee must be <hi>infinite,</hi> in whom this power is seated.</p>

This will cause you to take <hi>great mindes</hi> to your selves to have a <hi>holy magnanimity</hi> in you: And the consideration of this Attribute is of great vse, to make Christians come to have great mindes. For what is it that makes the <hi>minde great?</hi> It is the <hi>greatnesse</hi> of the object: whence it is, that Kings have <hi>great mindes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their <hi>great</hi> Kingdomes; and <hi>great men</hi> have <hi>great thoughts,</hi> because of the <hi>great objects</hi> that they have to looke vpon. Now therefore, if thou wouldest looke vpon the <hi>great God,</hi> if thou wouldest consider that he is thy Father, and that all that hee hath is thine, this would likewise make thy <hi>minde</hi> exceeding <hi>great:</hi> it would take from us that <hi>pusillanimity</hi> and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rownesse of mind, which we are subject to; and it is of great moment it should doe so. A litle mind though it be good, yet because it is a litle vessell, it can bee and receive but a litle good; whereas when the <hi>minde</hi> is <hi>great</hi> it is capable of <hi>great</hi> grace, <hi>great</hi> actions, and <hi>great</hi> indeavours: therefore we should get our minds to be inlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by considering the <hi>greatnesse of</hi> GOD, and our interest in it. For want of this it is, that Christians are so apt to bee led aside into by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes by the power of <hi>great</hi> men; because they thinke that they are greatly graced when they are look't after by <hi>great</hi> men; when as if they did know their owne <hi>greatnesse,</hi> that they are <hi>Sonnes of</hi> GOD, <hi>and heires</hi> of heaven, this goes beyond it. Hence likewise it is, that men are so easily wrought vpon by pleasure, profit,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:15479:169"/>
and the like, that they are ready to transgresse: why is it? It is, because they doe not know what they are borne to, that the <hi>great</hi> GOD of heaven is theirs.</p>
            <p>So what is the reason, that the praise, and credit of men, doe so much affect you? but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we have so litle mindes? whereas, if <hi>God</hi> were knowne in his <hi>greatnesse,</hi> what would the praise of <hi>great</hi> men be to the praise of the <hi>great</hi> GOD? This would give us much strength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these temptations. And hence it is that young students that are provided for, have their mindes lift vp to vanities: whereas if their minds were <hi>great,</hi> they would despise them, and labour to serve the <hi>great</hi> GOD with their strength and parts.</p>
            <p>And so men that are growne vp, if they have estate inough, they leave the high and honorable calling of the Ministery; the reason is, because they overvalue these outward things: whereas, if a man had, a <hi>great mind,</hi> nothing would bee <hi>great</hi> to him.</p>
            <p>Hence also it is, that men are so stirred with variety of conditions; when prosperity comes, it shakes them one way; when crosses and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity comes, it troubles them on the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side: and what is the reason, but because they seeme <hi>great</hi> to them: which appeares from hence, because they stirre vp <hi>great</hi> affections. Therefore the way, to walke even in both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, is, to get this <hi>greatnesse of mind:</hi> for it is the weakenesse of minde, which causeth a
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:15479:170"/>
man to be over affected with these things, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce too much in the one, and to bee too much affected with the other. Even as, wee see, a weake eye, as the eyes of <hi>Owles</hi> and <hi>Bats,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not indure a <hi>great</hi> light; and a weake braine cannot beare strong drinke: but a strong eye, as the eye of an <hi>Eagle,</hi> can indure the greatest light; so a strong minde, it will indure <hi>great</hi> grace and disgrace, with the same temper, it will beare all well enough, it knowes <hi>how to want and how to abound</hi>; because he hath a <hi>great</hi> and a strong <hi>minde:</hi> whereas others have their eyes dazeled, and their braines made giddy as it were with the favour or losse of great men.</p>
            <p>Hence also it is that wee are so busie about worldly things, dignity, and riches, &amp;c. It is true we should seeke after these things, but why doe we doe it <hi>tanto conatu?</hi> It was <hi>Paules great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of mind,</hi> that made him <hi>ambitious to preach the Gospell</hi>; to serve tables, and such like, were small matters, hee would not looke after them: So if wee had <hi>great minds,</hi> wee should seeke for grace, and how to increase in it, how to live an usefull, and painefull and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table life. Worldly things are too litle for the mind to bestow it selfe upon; which would be so to us, if we could see GOD in his <hi>greatnesse,</hi> and our interest in it.

Saint <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 5.12. the <hi>Galathians</hi> had done him <hi>great injury,</hi> yet saith he, <hi>Brethren, be as I am, for I am as you are:</hi> you have done me great injury, but I esteeme it not, <hi>you have not hurt mee at all.</hi> For, a man inlarged to a holy <hi>greatnesse of mind,</hi> all the injuries put upon him by men, seeme small to him: when men are full of complaints, and say, they cannot beare such disgrace and slander, and reproach; this doth not proceede from the <hi>greatnesse,</hi> but from the weaknesse of their <hi>mindes.</hi> Men thinke it indeede <hi>greatnesse of minde,</hi> not to passe over these things, not to put up an injury: but surely it is a note of a <hi>great minde,</hi> to overlooke them all. So it is true on the other side, not to regard the praise of men: The Philosopher could say, that the <hi>magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi> man did not regard the praise of common men, because he was above them; and he is but a weake man, that would regard the praise of children, because they are not able to judge: so hee hath but a weake minde, that regards the praise of worldly men; for they are too little for him to regard, if hee did see GOD in his <hi>greatnesse.</hi> This made <hi>Paul</hi> to say, that hee did not care for mans day, let them say what they will by me, better or worse, I regard it not. (There is indeede a meete regard to be had of of them; but if they come into competition
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:15479:171"/>
with <hi>God,</hi> then they must beare no weight at all:) and thus because disgrace and disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp;c. seemed but little to him, he despised them all.</p>
            <p>So from this weaknesse of minde ariseth that cowardlinesse which wee see often in men. Whence is it that men are so fearefull to holde out the light of a holy profession? is it not from hence, that they are <hi>pusillanimous,</hi> that they doe too much esteeme the face of men? A Lion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he knowes himselfe to be a Lion, if the dogges barke, hee walkes in the street and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards them not; he turneth not his head aside for them: So a magnanimous man, that knowes himselfe in GODS favour, will passe by the obloquies of m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n. You shall see <hi>David</hi> did so: hee went on in his course like a Lion, when <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei</hi> railed against him, so that the two sonnes of <hi>Zerviah</hi> would have cut off his head; No, let him alone, saith he, the <hi>Lord</hi> then raised him up to a great mind. So was it with <hi>Paul, he passed through evill report, &amp; good report,</hi> &amp; never turned aside for any. So <hi>Moses,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ieremy, They shall smite thee with the tongue of men, &amp;c.</hi> sayes GOD, <hi>but I am with thee.</hi> And so, if wee could see GOD in his <hi>greatnesse,</hi> all these outward things would seeme nothing to us. As a hundred torches appeare to be nothing, when wee looke upon the Sunne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so, if we could consider aright of the <hi>greatnesse of God,</hi> all the faire speeches of men would be as nothing. Now the way to get this <hi>magnanimity,</hi> is to beleeve this <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:15479:171"/>
of God,</hi> and to consider that wee are the <hi>sonnes of God,</hi> and <hi>heires</hi> of heaven: the cause of this pusillanimity is the want of faith. If wee did beleeve that we were the <hi>sonnes of God,</hi> and did beleeve that GOD would be with us, that he was so <hi>great</hi> a GOD, and that hee did stand by, and second us, we should not be so feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as we are. Therefore strengthen your faith, that you may have your mindes inlarged, that so you may walke without impediments, and be perfect with him; as it is said of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that hee was <hi>perfect</hi> with <hi>God</hi> in all his wayes.</p>

                  </gap>
               </note> I answer. </p>
            <p>First, it ariseth thus from it. When a man considers that GOD is so exceeding <hi>great,</hi> and that hee
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:15479:173" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath interest in him, that will make him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise all other things, as small things in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of him. Indeed, if GOD was <hi>great,</hi> and we had no interest in him, then there was no cause why wee should take to our selves this <hi>magnanimity</hi> upon any such ground: but seeing that he is so great, and that his <hi>greatnes</hi> shall be improved to our advantage, what addition can any thing else make unto us? You shall see that <hi>Paul</hi> raised his heart upon this ground: <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. considering the priviledges that hee had in <hi>Christ,</hi> this makes him to account other things as nothing. Hence in <hi>Iames</hi> 1.10. <hi>Let him that is of a high degree, rejoyce in that hee is made low:</hi> that is, let him rejoyce that hee is inabled to looke upon his riches which he did so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly magnifie before, to thinke them as nothing, but as fading flowers; let him rejoyce in it, because now he is made a greater man, because he seemes too bigge for them; they are no such things, as before he thought them to be: not that they are made lesse, but because he is exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and lifted above them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, so likewise there is a rise for it in this regard, because he is able to defend us, and protect us, and beare us out against all opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. You see that men looke <hi>great,</hi> because they have got <hi>great</hi> men or Princes to beare themselves upon. But when men consider that they have the <hi>great God</hi> on their side, to beare themselves upon, why should not they have <hi>great mindes?</hi> Thus <hi>Moses, Hebr.</hi> 11. regarded
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:15479:173"/>
not the wrath of the King, because hee did see that GOD that was invisible: that is, when he considered GOD in his greatnesse, the King and his wrath were nothing to him. So that the way to get this <hi>magnanimity,</hi> is, to beleeve that GOD is our GOD: and <hi>according to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of a mans faith, such will be this greatnes and magnanimity of minde</hi> that we commend to you. <hi>Saul,</hi> when he was a King, had a new heart, and a new spirit, because when he beleeved in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest that he was a King, he looked upon things after another manner; he had other thoughts and other affections than he had before: and so would any man else, if he were advanced from a meane estate to a kingdome. And, if we did beleeve that wee were the <hi>sonnes of the great God</hi> of heaven and earth, wee would have <hi>great mindes;</hi> therefore <hi>the stronger our faith is, the greater our minde is.</hi> Onely this is to be added; that this faith must not be in the habit onely in thee, but it must bee exercised and renewed continually: there must not be onely <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the actuall use of it. And were that which GOD said to <hi>Abraham, (I am thy excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great reward,)</hi> were this beheld of any of us, that GOD is so <hi>great,</hi> and that this <hi>greatnesse</hi> is our <hi>exceeding great reward,</hi> then all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards would seeme but small things. You shall see what <hi>David</hi> did upon this ground, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 27.1. <hi>The Lord is my light, and my salvation, whom shall I feare? the Lord is the strength of my life, of whom shall I be afraid?</hi> See, here are two
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:15479:174"/>
things: First, he considers that GOD is his; <hi>He is my salvation.</hi> Secondly, he considers the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> and strength and power of <hi>God</hi>; and from thence he drawes this conclusion, whom shall I feare? For in thee doe I trust; that is, in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and <hi>greatnesse</hi> of GOD, and the interest that I have in him. <hi>Psal.</hi> 46.1.2.3. GOD <hi>is our refuge and strength: a</hi> very <hi>present help in trouble, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will we not feare though the earth be removed, and though the mountaines be carried into the midst of the Sea: though the waters thereof roare and bee troubled, and though the mountaines shake with the swelling thereof:</hi> that is, when GOD is seene in his <hi>greatnesse,</hi> when we looke vpon him, and beleeve him to be such a <hi>God,</hi> and that we have interest in him, in the <hi>greatest</hi> trouble and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that can befall vs: <hi>though the earth be shaken, and the mountaines cast into the midst of the Sea,</hi> yet the minde will not be shaken, but still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines the same. They beare out all, because they have a <hi>great God,</hi> to beare themselves vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who will protect and defend them vpon all occasions.</p>

Wee ought to feare his wrath, lest it come upon us, and his goodnesse least we loose it: for he is a <hi>great God,</hi> and his
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:15479:174"/>
wrath is able to crush in peices, and to consume us, as he expressed it, when hee put forth but some part of his strength, as when he consumed them with their Censers, even the company of <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram. Who can dwell with everlasting burnings</hi>? as if he should say; he is a <hi>great God,</hi> who can come neere him? who can converse with him? how shall men deale with him? Some of them there made an evill use of it: but we must learne to make use of it for our owne advantage; to take heed, how we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him: for is it a small thing to have the great <hi>God</hi> of heaven and earth our enemy? Let them consider this, that live without GOD in the world, that sinne, and will sinne, they are told of their particular faults, of their idlenesse &amp;c. and they are so and will be so still: but let them consider that which is spoken in 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 10.22. <hi>Doe we provoke the Lord to jealousie? Are we stronger than he?</hi> He speakes it to them that receive the Sacrament unworthily: as if hee should say; Both in this, and in all other sinnes that you doe commit, you doe, as it were, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with the <hi>great God,</hi> which is a vaine thing, if you consider his <hi>greatnesse</hi>: for <hi>are you stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then he?</hi> So <hi>Psal.</hi> 90. <hi>Who knowes the power of his wrath?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so should we doe in regard of his <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, Hos:</hi> 3. <hi>vlt: Men shall feare his goodnesse:</hi> that is, if his goodnesse be so <hi>great and infinite,</hi> as himselfe, then the losse of it, is a losse above all things in the world. Whatsoever is precious to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:15479:175" rendition="simple:additions"/>
us, that we feare the losse of, as our liberties and lives: and as things are more precious to us, the more we feare the losse of them. Now the goodnesse of <hi>God</hi> is <hi>greater</hi> than all other things, it is beyond all these, as having all these in it: therfore wee are to feare the losse of it as the <hi>greatest</hi> evill in the world.</p>
            <p>Therefore if we could see the extension of his wrath and goodnesse, the losse of the one would be the <hi>greatest</hi> losse, and the other the <hi>greatest</hi> crosse; the enjoying of the one the <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test</hi> good, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of the other the <hi>greatest</hi> evill in the world: and the consideration of this would helpe us to guide our hopes and feares aright: for a <hi>great</hi> cause of misleading us in our wayes, are the vaine hopes and feares that we are subject to: we feare the losse of friends, and losse of lives and liberties; but these in comparison are not to be feared. This use <hi>Christ</hi> makes of it: <hi>Feare not those that can kill the body, but feare the great God, that can destroy both body and soule.</hi> The <hi>greatnes</hi> of his wrath wee should feare as the <hi>greatest</hi> evill: and his goodnesse as the chiefest good: and our thoughts and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being taken up about these two, it would set our hopes and feares aright; and worldly things, as credit, and profit, &amp;c. would seeme nothing to us, and prevaile nothing with us.</p>

               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:15479:176" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this is to <hi>love him with all our strength.</hi> And if you consider how <hi>great</hi> a <hi>God</hi> he is, you will see great reason why you should love him thus <hi>with all your strength.</hi> Therefore we should check our selves when we see the dulnesse of our hearts, how ready and how apt wee are to bestow our love upon any besides him: we should observe all those riverets wherein our love goes out, and runnes to other things, and bring them backe againe into the right channell. For if you consider the <hi>greatnesse of God,</hi> you will see, that there is no love to spare.</p>

This property or Attribute of <hi>immensity</hi> must needes be given to <hi>God,</hi> because his essence is <hi>infinite,</hi> which hath beene before proved. Now as the argument holds good, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the substance of every thing, such must the quality be in things that have quantity; if the body be great, so must the quantity bee: So, if <hi>God</hi> be an <hi>infinite</hi> essence, (as he is) there is as good reason that he should have an <hi>infinite</hi> presence accompanying it, as that a great bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hath a quantity answerable to it.

it, that his power is every where, he guides all things, he puts forth his power every where: Now in the <hi>Lord</hi> seeing there is no facultie as is in man, but whatsoever is in him, is himselfe; it cannot be, but that he himselfe must be in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very place where he doth any thing. The fire may heate afarre off, and so may the Sunne, give light to the whole world, and yet abide in the firmament, because it hath a quality of heat, and light: but Almighty <hi>God</hi> is most simple, there is no composition in him, no qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, no executive power, but hee is himselfe what he is, and therefore what he doth is done by himselfe immediatly, <hi>immediatione suppositi,</hi> as the Schoolemen expresse it.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, I adde,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 3.</note> that GOD must bee every where present, not onely within the world, but as <hi>Salomon</hi> expresseth it, <hi>The heaven of heavens cannot containe him:</hi> that is, hee is without the world as well as within it, because wee cannot deny but that hee is able to make other worlds as well as this; and then if hee should not be without the world, he should move himselfe, and change his place: and there should bee a world where hee is not present: but he is not capable of any change, of any motion or altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of place.</p>
                  <p>Onely one caution must be taken in: You see that the light is in many places throughout the world, but the presence of GOD is not like to that presence, nor the presence of any creature, because he is totally present: the creatures are
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:15479:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not so, but according to the parts of them, one part here, another there: but GOD being without all parts, whereso ever he is, he must be totally there. Therefore you must not conceive, <hi>God</hi> is commensurable by the place, as if he were partly here, and partly in another place, but he is every where all present. The heavens you see have a large place, but they have one part here, another there: but the <hi>Lord</hi> is totally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, wheresoever he is present.</p>

For though there bee meanes vsed, yet hee is present with those meanes. Other Kings must needes governe by Deputies and Viceroyes; and inferiour Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates of justice, because they cannot be every where: whence it comes to passe, that Kings may be good, and yet the people may be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by their wicked instruments. But with the <hi>Lord</hi> it is not so: but he guides immediatly, and being every where present, he needeth no Deputies, for he is not capable of information, as Kings are, but sees all with his owne eyes, and heares all with his owne eares. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, he useth no Deputies: for the use of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties argues a defect, as the using of spectacles or crutches doth, if the eyes or legges were well and sound inough, a man would not use them; so a man would not write letters, or use
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:15479:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>
other meanes to doe his businesse, but from a defect; he is not large inough to doe his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse immediately: But almighty <hi>God,</hi> he is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where present, and in his governing al things are done by his owne Almighty power. Good Governours, may have wicked instruments, contrary to their mindes, which they know not of, as <hi>Ely,</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> had: but in GODS Government it is not so; therefore learne from hence, not to complaine of the iniquitie of the times, or the injustice of men. It is true, that a kind mother may ignorantly put her child to a wicked Nurse, that will abuse it: but GOD never puts any of his children to Nurse, but he is present with them, his government is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate. So that that which is said of <hi>David,</hi> he is <hi>a man after Gods owne heart,</hi> it may be said of every King and Governour; they doe, what <hi>God</hi> would have them to doe, though it be for evill, as his was for good, they are men <hi>after Gods owne heart.</hi> As it was in the killing of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> even that is said to be done <hi>by the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Counsell of God.</hi> And therefore let no man complaine of his Governours: for <hi>God</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernes not by Deputies, but by himselfe. Therefore let no man say, that hee hath an evill Master or Governour, but let him acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that whatsoever he hath from man, it is the worke of the Almighty <hi>God,</hi> that is every where present: it is he that disposeth of men, and puts them into such a condition; for he is the King of heaven and earth. Therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine

to him, and be patient, because he hath done it: doe not complaine of men, and fret against them, because the <hi>Lord</hi> is not absent in his kingdome, but is present to guide and dispose them according to his owne pleasure.</p>

                  <p>Learne therefore to studie this Attribute. The more we know him by it, the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort we gather from it. As, is it not matter of great comfort, that in all places wee should have a GOD to doe all our businesses? To which purpose is that expression in <hi>Ier.</hi> 23.23, 24. <hi>Hee is a God nigh at hand:</hi> that is, though your businesse lie in other Countries, yet I am there to doe them for you. And againe, is it not comfort to consider that hee is with your enemies (it may be) in a distance place? For you thinke, that if you were there, you would have something to prevent them. Consider that hee is there, and after another manner, than any man is: hee is present with their mindes, and knowes their counsells, and moves their hearts, and disposeth of all their counsells. As <hi>Elisha</hi> tolde the King of <hi>Arams</hi> counsell to the King of <hi>Israel,</hi> (which shewed that GOD was there.) So also hee is present with thy friends when they are absent: it may be that they forget us, yet he can stirre them up, as he did stirre up <hi>Cyrus</hi> to doe what hee did for the people of <hi>Israel.</hi> So likewise he is present with our children, when wee are with GOD, when we are gone out of this world, to provide for
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:15479:181"/>
them, and to bring them up. Hee is present with all our affaires, and businesses; when we are absent, and know not how things goe, we are apt to be sollicitous: but if we would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that he is a great <hi>God,</hi> and that he is every where, this should comfort us, and stay our hearts. And therefore thinke with thy selfe, that thou hast a large portion, because thou hast the LORD. And this is the second use.</p>

It seemes something strange to men, that every small thing should be disposed of by him;<note place="margin">See a ground of his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar providence in the smallest things.</note> we thinke indeed that great things are: but for the least things, therein we are apt to make a doubt, and can hardly beleeve it. But this point in hand is a great confirmation of this truth. If an horse stumble by the way, wee thinke it a common accident; if a fly fall into a mans eye, or if a tile fall off from the house, or an axe head, we looke upon them as common accidents; but if we consider that he is present there, it is then an easie matter for us to beleeve, that <hi>God</hi> doth disposed all these: when the axe head falls off, it is in his hand, as before it was in the hand of the workeman. If he be present with every small creature, with every fly, with every <hi>sparrow</hi> and stone, with every motion of the creature, then all the actions that befall us, they are all his workes. <hi>In him wee live, move, and have our being:</hi> that is, hee is present with every creature. Therefore it is no difficulty to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:15479:181"/>
beleeve, that hee guides the smallest thing. If an enemy hurt us, wee are to thinke, that he is but as a <hi>staffe in Gods hand,</hi> as it is said of <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar.</hi> Every accident is but as a <hi>cup,</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> saith of the <hi>cup</hi> that was brought to him by others, <hi>Shall not I drinke of the cup, which my Father gives me?</hi> So wee may say of every af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. The tongues of men are but scourges in his hand, hee can rule them as he pleaseth: and so wee should thinke of every action. And indeed the more wee thinke of his particular providence, the more wee conceive of his <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitenesse.</hi> For why doe wee thinke men to bee present, but because they see and heare? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they doe something? If the body be there, and the soule gone, wee say, that the man is absent: it is the action that makes them present. Therefore the Schoolemen say, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells are said to bee present here or there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they worke there. Therefore, I say, the more that wee can see <hi>Gods</hi> hand in every acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the more wee acknowledge his presence. Therefore we should labour to bee abundant in considering the <hi>Omnipresence of God</hi> upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions: as if a man bee out of the way, and one come and tells him that he is so, wee should bee ready to say, that GOD sent him. If we are in a strait, and know not what to doe, and there come one, and helps vs; wee should say that it comes from <hi>God.</hi> So did <hi>David</hi> when <hi>Abigail</hi> came and met him; he saith that the <hi>Lord sent her.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 25.32. And this would
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:15479:182"/>
easily bee beleived, if we would thinke that hee is present every where. There is no man that speakes for us or against us, that doth us either hurt or good, but GOD is present with him, and stirres him up to it, whatsoever it be. 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 5.26. <hi>And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul King of Assyria, &amp;c.</hi> that is, he himselfe was present with his Spirit, he <hi>stirred</hi> him up: (for the thoughts of men have their rising up, from their spirit stirring them to good or evill.) So also for their speeches: when <hi>Shimei</hi> cursed <hi>David, David</hi> saith, that it was <hi>the Lord that sent him.</hi> So the <hi>Lord</hi> is present with the creatures: it is hee that acts them, and sets them on worke to doe us any good. And this is the next vse that wee are to make of it.</p>

to feare, for the <hi>Lord</hi> is present.

And if you say, that nothing is done, but hee abuseth mee more and more: I answer. Consider, it is not because the <hi>Lord</hi> is weake, and cannot helpe us; or because he is negligent, and will not doe it; no, he is present, and sees it all the while: but you must consider, that the due time is not come, therefore you must be quiet, and not tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous in your thoughts, and revengefull in your spirits, because the LORD lookes on, and will avenge you in due time. Therefore this is the thing added in <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. Because, when a man suffers any thing from another man, then he will be ready to be sollicitous, how to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and what he shall doe hereafter; saith the Apostle, <hi>Be you in nothing carefull, &amp;c. for the</hi> LORD <hi>is at hand</hi>: that is, he doth not stand by
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:15479:183"/>
as a looker on, or a bare spectator, who meanes to doe nothing but see the injuries done and suffered, but he lookes on, as one that takes care for you. <hi>Therefore be you in nothing carefull: but in every thing by prayer, and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made knowne unto</hi> GOD.</p>

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:15479:184"/>
all that he doth, hee that observes all these pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of his providence toward him, and about him, hee makes himselfe present with the <hi>Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, he that speakes to the <hi>Lord,</hi> and maketh knowne his secrets to him, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peens to him all his desires, and all his greifes upon all occasions, he makes himselfe present with him.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, he that pleaseth GOD in all his actions, and doth what is acceptable to him, that doth what he hath commanded, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staines from what hee hath forbidnen, he which behaves himselfe after this manner, makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe present with the <hi>Lord.</hi> For this last, you shall see, if you compare that in <hi>Genesis,</hi> of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nochs</hi> walking with GOD, with that in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5. To make our actions agreable to the rule of his will, this is to walke with the <hi>Lord:</hi> for <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch</hi> is said to <hi>walke with God,</hi> in <hi>Genesi</hi>; and in the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> he is said to <hi>please of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p> And, as wee must be thus present with the <hi>Lord,</hi> So <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> secondly, wee must make him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with us. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> As first, we must looke upon him, as one who obserueth all that we doe. When a man hath this full perswasion in his heart, not onely habitually, but actually, that the <hi>Lord</hi> lookes upon him in all that he speakes, and doth, hee makes the <hi>Lord</hi> present with him; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> So se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when a man shall observe the <hi>Lord</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to him, which a man doth in meditating in the word. But this is not inough: but you
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:15479:185"/>
must observe what the <hi>Lord</hi> saith to you upon every occasion, and in every passage of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence also.</p>
            <p>But you will say, that the <hi>Lord</hi> doth not speake to us now as he did to the Prophets.</p>
            <p>Yes, he doth in a manner speake to us.</p>
            <p>How doth the <hi>Lord</hi> speake to us now?</p>
            <p>Hee speakes to our consciences: that is the immediate deputy by which he speakes to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man. And also hee speakes to us by the suggestions of the Spirit, and the good motions of it: hee speakes to us by the good counsell of our friends, and of the Ministers, and others; hee speakes to us by the passages of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence (for a man may make knowne his will by his actions, as well as by his word.) I say, to observe what the <hi>Lord</hi> saith to us in all these, this is a part of our walking with him.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Lastly, so consider what hee doth, and what the mercies are, which hee shewes to thee: what corrections, what judgements, what turnings of his providence, what hee doth to those that are neare thee; (for <hi>God</hi> would have us to take speciall notice of it, as in <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.22. So observe what is brought to your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; for as the word of <hi>God,</hi> so also his workers ought to bee sought out by them that belong to him.</p>
            <p>After this manner wee should walke with the <hi>Lord</hi> from day to day. And it is one thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, whereof you are put in minde, when you here that he is every where present, you should
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:15479:185"/>
bee present with him upon all occasions, and observe his dealing towards you, and your carriage to him. Every man walkes with some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing continually: now looke what a mans mind is busied about most, that he walkes with. And indeed, to walke with any thing, is to giue it the honour that is due onely to GOD. When a man is busie about what men thinke of him; about his riches and estate, how they ebbe and flow, about his credit with men; these are the things that a man walkes with. Beloved, you are not to goe a step with any thing, except hee send you on such an errand, as a Master doth his servant; but you are to walke with him from day to day. It is possible that a man may bee in company, and his mind bee in another place, and busied about other things: and where his mind is, there hee walkes. A man may bee in the world, and yet his mind and <hi>conversation in heaven</hi>; as <hi>Enoch</hi> did the things of this life, and yet hee is said to <hi>walke with God:</hi> if thou doest so, this is a signe that thou lovest GOD; for to walke with a thing, it is the best argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that thou lovest it. Let a man professe never so much love to a freind, if he will not walke with him, it is but in shew, and not in truth. If thou wouldest shew thy love to <hi>God,</hi> why doest thou not walke with him? If there bee a freind that thou lovest, doest thou not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to bee with him? And when thou art in company with him, is it not a signe also of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect. As when many are together, all goe to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:15479:186" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the chiefe man: so thou must walke with GOD. You know what GOD saith to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>I am God All-sufficient: walke with me, and hee thou perfect.</hi> Marke here the connection: as if he should say, <hi>Abraham,</hi> when I desire this, thou shouldest withdraw thy selfe from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures, and things, to walke with me: know that there is great reason for it, for <hi>I am All-sufficient,</hi> thou needest no other. If thou hast a friend <hi>all-sufficient,</hi> hast thou not need to walke with him? But as wee shewed you, <hi>God</hi> is in stead of ten thousand friends. A man needs many friends, a friend at Court, a friend at home, a friend abroad, to be there where hee himselfe cannot bee: but wheresoever thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, the <hi>Lord</hi> is with thee: if into banishment, banishment is nothing you will say, if I might have all my companions with mee; now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that GOD is with thee: if thou goest into imprisonment, hee is there. A man will say, that no friend in the world can doe so, but yet the <hi>Lord</hi> doth. When <hi>Iacob</hi> went to <hi>Padax Aram,</hi> GOD promised him, that he would goe with him, <hi>Ioseph,</hi> when he went into prison, GOD went with him: and with <hi>Paul</hi> when he was in bonds. And <hi>Abraham</hi> was banished in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a strange Country, and the <hi>Lord</hi> tells him, that he would bee with him there: and that makes a mans home and country, and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to bee every where, hee is at home, when he is a broad; and at liberty, when he is in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Now therefore let a man consider this,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:15479:186"/>
that wheresoever he is, yet GOD is with him; who is able to direct us in all our doubts, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend us in all danger, and to provide for us in all our necessities. And then consider also what benefit comes by this; thou shalt grow ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him, and then thou canst finde the way to him upon all occasions whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, when other men cannot. Another man would faine goe to GOD, but he knowes not the way. <hi>Iob.</hi> 22.21. <hi>Acquaint now thy selfe with him, and be at peace, thereby good shall come unto thee:</hi> that is, serve GOD, and thou shalt prosper. The meaning is this, one that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with GOD, when he hath any thing to doe, he may goe to GOD, and get helpe from him, and so bring his enterprises to passe: he knowes the way to put up a prayer to him, and he shall finde a present helpe upon all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>So consider in the time of death; if thou hast accustomed thy selfe to walke with <hi>God,</hi> if in thy life time thou hast beene acquainted with him, death will be no death to thee. Death in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede is bitter, because it drawes a man from his home, from his friends and acquaintance, and into a strange place: and therefore you use to say, we know not what we shall have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, we know what we have here, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the soule trembles at it. Whence comes this, but because we have not beene wonted to walke with the LORD? Is it a great thing for him to die, when he hath the same company, and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:15479:187"/>
the same friends with him still? It is <hi>but chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the place, not his company:</hi> one of the spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches repeated by the Authour at his death: for he is present every where. Therefore our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thence is, no maintaine such a constant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, that we may be able to fetch helpe, and comfort, and direction from him, so that we neede not turne aside to the creatures, and be dependent upon them. And indeed one that is acquainted with the LORD, and hath full communion with him, may be satisfied with that alone: for what is it that makes a man to desire company? It ariseth from these two things.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, partly because one would have fit ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to exercise his faculties upon: which if hee had not, they would languish, and a weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somnesse would grow upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, because hee would have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and direction, and helpe and advice, and comfort brought into his empty heart, by such friends as are able to suggest it to him: and therefore they desire company. Now shall they not finde this in the <hi>Lord</hi> more than in any creature? Is not he then the worthiest and the highest object, on whom they should bestow their thoughts?</p>
            <p>Againe, cannot he fill thy heart with joy and comfort? is not he onely wise to give thee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection upon all occasions? and is there any then that thou shouldest choose to walke with more than with him? Every man, the more
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:15479:187"/>
faith he hath, and the more wisedome he hath, the more able hee is to walke with GOD, and with himselfe: the more unbeleeving, and weake, and unconstant, the more unable hee is to be alone. And the ground of it is: <hi>By faith a man walkes with God, and by reflection hee walkes with himselfe.</hi> There are two companions which a man needes never to be destitute of, GOD and himselfe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, a man walkes by faith when hee sees GOD present, and speaking to him, and hee speakes againe to the LORD: and the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger a mans faith is, the more he doth it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Againe, a man walkes with himselfe by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on his owne actions, and heart, and wayes; a beast cannot walke with it selfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it cannot recoyle and turne in upon it selfe; neither can children or fooles, or weake and unconstant men: therefore they cannot be without company, it is a hell to them to be alone; and the lesse a mans wisedome is, the more he complaines of want of company.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore <hi>God</hi> is every where present, labour to strengthen thy faith in that his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and so thou maist still be with him, and walke with him.</p>
            <p>And then secondly, labour to speake to thy selfe, to reproove and admonish thy selfe, to consider thine owne wayes and actions, to cheare and comfort thy selfe, (for these are all the actions of one that makes himselfe a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion:) and hee that doth these things, shall
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:15479:188"/>
never complaine of want of company, and soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarinesse.</p>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 6</note>Sixthly, If <hi>God</hi> bee every where present, then he is present to observe all the sinnes that thou committest, and to observe all the good that thou doest. Then make this use of it: that the presence of the <hi>Lord</hi> should be a restraint to keepe thee from sinning, on the one hand, and it should incourage thee on the other hand to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in every good worke.<note place="margin">Hee observeth all the sinnes thou commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test and all the good thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est: for enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and restrainte.</note> Therefore a man should say thus with himselfe: I dare not doe this, because <hi>God</hi> is present, he stands by and lookes on. It was <hi>Iosephs</hi> reason to his Mistres. Though we be alone, yet <hi>God</hi> is present, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdes it: And <hi>how can I doe this great wickednesse, and sinne against God,</hi> As if he should say; though we see him not, yet he is present, and sees it, and knowes it. And not onely say, I dare not doe it, but thou shouldest say, I dare not so much as thinke it: for he beholdes the thoughts. You shall see an excellent place for this, if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>Iob.</hi> 31. verse: 1. and 4. together, it is one continued speech. <hi>I have made a covenant with mine eyes: why then should I thinke upon a maid? Doth not hee see my wayes and count all my steps?</hi> As if hee should say; I durst not give so much as give liberty to my thoughts, because hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held all my wayes. it is a question which those that feare <hi>God</hi> have beene wont to aske; How shall I doe to bee rid of such and such thoughts, that haunt mee continually? I would very faine bee rid of them. This is an excellent
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:15479:188" rendition="simple:additions"/>
way: to consider that GOD himselfe stands by annd knowes all thy thoughts, and takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them. As put this case; Suppose a wise and godly man should stand by and take notice of all thy base thoughts, that passe through thy heart, wouldest thou not bee ashamed of thy selfe? If thy body were made a glasse, and men should see all thy thoughts through it, wouldst thou not bee ashamed of them, and carefull in them, as wee are of our actions now before men? Now to consider that the <hi>Lord</hi> beholds them, to consider that he sees every thought, (the least whereof is no light matter,) this would be a meanes to restraine thee. Nay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that the <hi>Lord</hi> doth not onely behold them, but he <hi>ponders</hi> all thy actions, to giue thee the fruit of them: so that <hi>God</hi> doth not stand by as a meere looker on, but he takes such notice of all thy thoughts, that passe through thy heart, and all thy vaine words, that he <hi>weighes</hi> them, as it were. And therefore hee is said in Scripture so often, to <hi>ponder our wayes.</hi> He puts thy sins, and those lusts in one ballance, and his censure in the other; and gives thee according: he puts weight for weight; he gives thee correction, if thou art his child, and judgement if thou bee wicked. Therefore thou must consider who it is that knowes them; what a one he is: as it is in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. when he tells his Churches that hee knowes them all, then hee describes himselfe, what a one he is: as his eyes to be of flaming fire, and his feete like brasse. This, if conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:15479:189"/>
would make a man to looke about him. If there was a company set together, and there was an informer standing by, and did note downe in his table-book what they did, and did declare it to their enemies, or to the King and Counsell, men would be exceeding wary, they would ponder every word before they spake: so when GOD is present, and beholdeth all that thou doest; hast thou not reason much more to consider thy wayes? Men say indeed, that the <hi>Lord</hi> is present every where, but our lives shew that wee <hi>thinke</hi> like the Atheists in <hi>Iob,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> is shut up in the thicke clouds, and cannot see through them. Yea there is noe man, but needs an increase of faith in this point. For if it were fully believed, it could not be, but that wee should take more heed to our wayes and thoughts than we doe. Therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you of and perswade you to this, I will name two places. One you shall finde in <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4.6. <hi>One God, one Lord, who is aboue you all, and in you all, and through all.</hi> First he is <hi>above all.</hi> As a man that stands <hi>above</hi> can see all that is done <hi>below</hi>: so the <hi>Lord</hi> lookes downe, and beholds all that is done on earth, as a man in an high place, sees all that is done below.</p>
            <p>But it may bee objected, though a man be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, yet there may be some corners, some rockes and dens, so that he may hide himselfe from the eyes of him that is aboue him: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is added, <hi>who is in you all</hi>; that is, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds every thought, every secret place, every
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:15479:189"/>
corner of our hearts: he is <hi>in you all, and through all.</hi> This you shall find more at large in <hi>Psa.</hi> 139.1. <hi>O Lord thou hast searched me and knowne me, thou knowest my downe sitting and mine up ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, thou understandest my thoughts afarre off &amp;c.</hi> The meaning of it is this. <hi>David</hi> labours to perswade his owne heart, that <hi>God</hi> is present with him; and he doth it by the argument: If I goe forward the <hi>Lord</hi> is there; if on this side or that side, yet still he is present, he compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth me round about, he is behind and before: therefore it must needs be, that there is not a word that I speake or a thought that I thinke, but he sees and heares all. Yea, <hi>he knowes my thoughts afarre off,</hi> that is, as a man that knowes what rootes he hath in his garden, though there be not a flower appeares, yet he can say, when the spring comes, this and this will come up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he knowes the garden, and knowes what roots are there: So the <hi>Lord</hi> knowes a mans thoughts afarre off, because he knowes the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that are within, and he knowes what they would doe, when occasion is offered; and therefore saith <hi>David,</hi> I have cause to feare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly before him. Nay, he doth not onely <hi>see</hi> mens <hi>thoughts afarre off,</hi> but he will judge you afarre off for them. Wee use to destroy hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke even in the middest of winter, because wee know what it will doe, if it be suffered to grow: so the <hi>Lord</hi> doth cut off men long before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, he knowes that they will doe this and this. Such passages of his providence there
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:15479:190"/>
may be, as to cut off children and yong men out of the foresight of the evill, that they would doe to his Church, because he knowes their thoughts afarre off.</p>
            <p>So hee knowes thy thoughts for good afarre off: therefore though a child of <hi>God</hi> may bee cut off in some undiscovered sinne, when hee hath not actually repented, yet GOD forgives it him, because he knowes what he would doe, if he had time to repent, and should come to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it: and therefore GOD judgeth him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: and likewise if wee have begun any good worke, if we be cut off before we have finished it, yet remember, that GOD knowes what wee would doe. And seing hee doth this, we should learne, exceedingly to feare before him, to ponder our owne thoughts and speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, seing GOD himselfe takes notice fo them.</p>
            <p>So it should bee a continuall incouragement to consider that GOD takes notice of all the good that we doe, as well as of the evill: <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. and 3. <hi>I know thy workes, thy labour and thy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, I know thy sufferings</hi>; that is, when a man is miscalled, slandered, and evill spoken of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he serves and feares <hi>God,</hi> because he is none of the worlds owne, and therefore it shewes forth its hatred in word, when it cannot in deed; (for malice must have some vent) yet <hi>I know thy sufferings,</hi> and let it bee inough that <hi>I know them</hi> and register them: there is not the least suffering but I take notice of it, and it shall bee
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:15479:190"/>
rewarded. Againe, men take much paines, and no man regardes it; yet <hi>God</hi> takes notice of their <hi>labour,</hi> and their <hi>paines,</hi> and not of their workes onely, but their labour in doing them, and sees what ends they put upon all. Againe, men put up injuries, and suffer much wrong, yet saith the <hi>Lord, I know thy patience &amp;c.</hi> What is said of this may be said of all other good actions. And it is a great honour to the <hi>Lord,</hi> that we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with this, that he alone knowes it. And so we may be well inough; for his knowledge will bring in a sure fruit with it, as he saith to <hi>Iacob. Gen.</hi> 31. I know all the labour thou hast done unto me. And what followed that? Why, <hi>God</hi> taught <hi>Iacob</hi> how to inlarge his wages, and so translated <hi>Labans</hi> substance to him. So <hi>Psa.</hi> 1. last. The meaning is, the <hi>Lord knowes the way of the righteous,</hi> and therefore it doth <hi>prosper,</hi> and shall. And he <hi>knowes the way of the wicked, and therefore they shall perish,</hi> Therefore it is inough to us, that he is present, and sees it, and knowes it.</p>
            <p>Againe this should stire us up to good duties, seeing he is alwaies present; you dnow souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers though they are some what cowardly other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, yet in the presence of the Generall, if hee looke on they will adventure much: so servants that are otherwise idle, yet they will doe eye-service, they will worke while the Master lookes on: so when we consider that the <hi>Lord</hi> stands by, and lookes on, and takes notice what paines we take, how we doe fight his battells,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:15479:191"/>
and what wee doe for him, it should incourage us and makes us <hi>abundant in the worke of the Lord,</hi> seeing we <hi>know, that our labour is not in vaine in the Lord.</hi> Nay it is an incouragement against the discouragement of men; thou maist have discouragement from friends, from neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and the place where thou livest: yet let this bee thy comfort, the <hi>Lord</hi> is present; hee knowes thy dwelling, thy neighbours, who is for thee, and who against thee, he knowes the difficulties thou meetest with any performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, he knowes what hindra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce thou hast, as it is there in the verse: 13. <hi>I know thy workes, and where thou dwellest, even where Sathans seat is, and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those dayes wherein Antipas was my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Martyr, who was slaine among you, where Sathan dwelleth.</hi>

thee, if thou goest into another Country, hee will be with thee there; or if thou diest and goe into another world, yet still he followes thee.

Thus men wrench their consciences, because they choose rather GODS enmity than mens. Doe but consider what it is, to have the <hi>Lord</hi> your enemy, he will meet thee in every place: Though man be thy enemy, yet he meetes not with thee every where; if thou be in thy chamber, hee cannot come at thee, but <hi>God</hi> will meete with thee there. And how will he meet thee? Hee will meet thee as a <hi>Lyon,</hi> and as a <hi>Beare</hi> robbed of her whelpes. You shall see how the <hi>Lord</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it: <hi>Amos</hi> 9.2.3.4.<note place="margin">Amos 9.2, 3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>Though they digge into Hell, thence shall my hand take them: though they climbe up to heaven, thence will I bring them downe. &amp;c.</hi> It is a common opinion, that if men have strong freinds, strong Towers, and a strong Land, that is well beset the Sea, and clifts, or great estates that will defend them; then they are safe: but if the <hi>Lord</hi> be thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, none of these will doe thee any good, verse 2.4. and yet if a man hath made peace with his enemies, he thinkes himselfe safe, as if there were no other enemy but mortall men. So the <hi>Iewes</hi> not being killed, but going into captivity onely, thought their lives safe, their peace
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:15479:192"/>
made: but, saith the <hi>Lord, If you goe into captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet there I will command the sword to slay you:</hi> verse 4. The meaning is this: no condition that a man can be in, no greatnesse, though he be compassed about with friends and safety on every side, can availe, if <hi>God</hi> be his enemy; he <hi>will pull thee from the midst of the sea</hi>: verse 3. and which yet is an hard thing, to finde a man in the midst of the sea: and all this is but to describe that no condition is safe, when <hi>God</hi> is a mans e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>I will not stand to prove it. It is observed by some Divines, <hi>that God is almighty,</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed seventy times in the Scripture. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.26. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.39. <hi>To God nothing is impossible. He doth whatsoever he will:</hi> and in <hi>Genesis,</hi> it is said, <hi>The God almighty be with thee, &amp;c. Genes.</hi> 28.3.</p>
                  <p>In handling this Attribute, I will shew you what it is, and the reasons of it, and the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions against it, as I have done in the rest.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Omnipotence</hi> of <hi>God</hi> lyes in this, that hee is able to doe whatsoever is absolutely, sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and generally possible to be done. Other things can doe what is possible to doe in their owne kinde; as fire can doe what belongs to fire to doe; and a Lion can doe what is possible for him to doe: so men, and Angels: but no creature can doe what is simply and absolutely possible to be done. Now whatsoever can be done, when the nature of the thing is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to it, without any limitation, that the <hi>Lord</hi> is able to doe: and herein is his <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence</hi> seene. And the ground of it is this.</p>
                  <p>Because all creatures are put into their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall kindes; a man is one kinde of creature, he is not an Angel; Angels are another kinde, they are not men; and as they are put in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall kindes, and hedged in, and limited with
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:15479:193"/>
bounds and definitions, so is their power limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; they can doe what is in their owne sphaere, and according to their essence and being, such is their power: But the <hi>Lord</hi> is a being without all limits and restraint, an absolute being, and an unlimited essence; and therefore he can be said not onely to doe things within such a compasse, within this or that kinde, but whatsoever is simply, and absolutely possible to be done; even that his power reacheth unto, and this is properly his <hi>Omnipotence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no Attribute of GOD, that doth need a greater degree of faith than this: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reasons are not unnecessary. The first rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son therefore is this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.</note>First, consider, that he that made these great things, he that made the highest heavens, and those heavens that thou seest, he that made the earth, and the deepe sea, he that made the wind, and the treasures of snow, and haile, hee that made the Angels, hee that wrought so many miracles, thou must thinke that hee that doth these things can doe the like: as hee that hath made a faire picture or statue, hee can make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; he that makes a faire house, you are ready to say, that he is able to build another. Looke then upon his great workes, and you will thinke that he is able to doe the like. This is an argument very frequent in Scripture, when there is any occasion of expressing <hi>Gods</hi> great power to bring any thing to passe: as hee that made <hi>heaven and earth, he that brought the children
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:15479:193"/>
of Israell out of Egipt,</hi> he <hi>that divided the red sea,</hi> he <hi>that wrought the wonders in Egipt before Pharoh and all his host</hi>; and such like.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 2.</note> consider the manner how the <hi>Lord</hi> did all these things. You know he did no more, but say, <hi>Let there bee light, and there was light: Let the trees bring forth, let the fishes mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply, and the aire bee filled with fowle, and it was so.</hi> Now to doe such things with a word, with such facility, is a signe of an <hi>infinite</hi> power: for when one can doe great things, with his breath, or little finger, we are apt to say, what could he doe if he put his whole strength to it? So the manner of his working doth shew the <hi>infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> of his power.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 3.</note> the further any thing is off from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the more power it requires to bring it to Being. As take base materialls, and there is greater power required, to make a faire buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them; to make a goodly statue of a crooked piece of wood, is harder, than that which comes neerer in propinquity to it. Now no being at all is in a thousand times greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, than the basest materialls are from such or such a being, and therefore the power must bee <hi>infinitely</hi> greater that brings it to being. Now the <hi>Lord</hi> hath done this, therefore his power must bee <hi>infinite</hi> great. To make this more plaine to you; Consider what it is that restraines mans power, so that he can goe no further: it is because the matter will not permit him. If you give him clay, and straw, hee can
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:15479:194" rendition="simple:additions"/>
make bricke; but if you give him nothing, hee can doe nothing: so if you give him timber, he can make an house; but if you give him none of these, hee can doe nothing. But suppose now, there was such an architectour, such a builder, that if he did but imagine the modell or frame of an house in his minde, hee could set it up of nothing, or make materialls at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, hee could make it as bigge as he could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, then also he could make as many hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses as hee could thinke of, and in as great and large a manner, as hee could conceive, if there were such a one, there would bee no restraint to him. Now the <hi>Lord</hi> is such a builder, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he conceives, he can make it without any thing, as he did the heavens and the earth: and therefore there is no restraint in his power, as there is in the creature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 4.</note>Fourthly, consider that the Attributes of <hi>God</hi> are equall, and needes must be so, because eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Attribute is his essence, and wee doe but distinguish then in our understanding: his <hi>omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie</hi> is but the <hi>active power,</hi> his wll, the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding</hi>; and his understanding, the <hi>directing:</hi> we distinguish them thus. But in him they are all one. Hence I reason thus: the wisedome of GOD, the largenesse and infinitenesse of his understanding and knowledge, what is it not able to conceive? You know men are able to thinke much, and Angells more than men, but GOD is able to conceive infinitely beyond them: For <hi>his thoughts are above ours, as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:15479:194" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are above the earth.</hi> Now whatsoever hee can conceive, his power is able to act it. In man it is not so; he imagines and wills many things, but his power falls short, because his faculties are not as large as the object: but <hi>God</hi> can imagine infinitely, and his power is as large and infinite as his wisedome: therefore he must be able to doe things that are infinite. So <hi>Psa:</hi> 135. <hi>He doth whatsoever he will,</hi> to shew that his power is as large as his will: which cannot bee said of any creature. Consider these things; for when you are in distresse, and put to it, you shall find need of them to perswade you that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>Allmighty.</hi>

farre in vaine, as it doth not attaine to that end and act: as bread is appointed to nourish; if it doth not, it is not fit for the end to which it is made, and so in vaine: I may say the same of every thing else. But that is not the end of <hi>Gods</hi> power, to bring forth any effect answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to it selfe: for his power (to speake proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) hath no end, but all things are made for it. In other things, the cause is proportionable for its end: but he himselfe is the cause of all other things; all that he doth, is for himselfe; and therefore though hee doth not produce any such effect, yet his power is infinite.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, when there is a repugnancy in the nature of the thing, it is no shortening or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of his power. Now a creature, if it be a creature, must be finite: And the <hi>Lord</hi> can doe what may be done: but to make a creature infinite, is a contradiction.

The meaning is this: let a man have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with GOD, let the <hi>Lord</hi> reveale him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to a man; if hee be once pleased to <hi>come</hi> to a man, <hi>and sup with him,</hi> if hee will but commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the consolations of the spirit, and <hi>fill him with joy and peace through beleiving</hi>: I say, though hee be in a close prison, yet he shall have the comfort of <hi>houses, Brethren, Sisters; Mothers &amp;c.</hi> That is, that comfort which they would yeeld him, he shall finde them altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in GOD. So that if one should come and say to him, what if you should have <hi>Father, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and <hi>friends</hi> restored to you, that you may injoy them; I say, a man that hath a neere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with GOD, to whom GOD saies, that hee will <hi>come and sup with him,</hi> at such a time; hee will say, I doe not care one jot for them, for I have that which is better than them all. For example: you see this in the Apostles, that rejoyced in prison. What doe you thinke they would have said to men that offered them rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es? Would they not have slighted them? They did slight imprisonment: and in that they did slight shame, and prison &amp;c. they would have slighted the other by the rule of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Therefore labour to be content with GOD alone.</p>
            <p>To make this argument without doubt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what heaven is. Doe you thinke, that there you shall have a worse condition than here? Here you have need of many comforts
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:15479:199"/>
and conveniences, it is a variegate appetite, that is, an appetite that is full of multiplicity: why, when you come to heaven, you doe not lay aside your nature, but you desire still; and there you shall have none but GOD alone: so that there you shall bee in a worse estate then here, if all these things were not to bee found in the <hi>Lord</hi>: if there were not this variety in the <hi>Lord,</hi> it could not bee, that in heaven you should bee so happy. Here you need Sunne, and Moone, and Starres, and a thousand other things, but there you shall have none, but I, saith he, <hi>will bee Sunne, and Moone,</hi> and all to you: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he saith, that hee will be <hi>all in all,</hi> which is the plurall number, and signifies, all things, I will be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Allmighty</hi> GOD, that will bee <hi>All-sufficient</hi> in heaven, if hee will but commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to a man, and draw him neare to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sénce, shall not that be inough? Beloved, it is certaine, that hee will bee inough for your por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As for instance; let a man be stripe of all his friends, and brethren and sisters, and country, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was: hee was stript of all, and had GOD alone left for his portion, yet you see that hee was exceeding rich, and made a great Prince, and he had a great posterity. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us make this use of it: to care for none but the <hi>Lord</hi> alone, wee know not what shall become of us, wee may be led into banishment, as others now are, and have bin: now if you have the <hi>Lord</hi> with you, it is inough. So if
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:15479:199"/>
any condition befall you, if you can bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with GOD alone, you are well, what if your friends deceive you? What if you should bee shut up in a close prison? It is nothing, he is <hi>All-sufficient</hi> and <hi>Allmighty,</hi> and there is no estate or condition, but hee is with you in it, there is no streit, but he can helpe you out. Therefore study these things, and examine them, and labour to beate them upon your soules: never rest, till you have brought your hearts to such a condition: to say, I know that no man can separate betweene GOD and me, and I am content with GOD alone.</p>

our parts to make use of it: though it be an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary disease in thee, (now you know an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary disease is that which we have from our parents,) though thou hast such a disease, such a strong lust, yet thinke with thy selfe, the <hi>Lord</hi> is able to heale this. <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.6. A place named before, <hi>But he giveth more grace, &amp;c.</hi> As if he should say: when hee had tolde them of the lusts that fight in their members, this objection comes in; Alas, wee are not able to master these lusts. It is true, saith the Apostle, the lusts that are in us, doe lust against the spirit, as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally as the stone descends downeward: but how should wee heale them, say you? How? The Scripture giveth more grace, that is, there is an omnipotent power which can heale all this.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.26. With men this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, <hi>but with God all things are possible.</hi> It is a place worthy consideration. Saith our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>It is impossible for a rich man to enter into the kingdome of heaven:</hi> why, say the Disciples, <hi>Who then can be saved?</hi> Indeed, saith <hi>Christ, it is impossible with men, but with God all things are possible.</hi> The meaning is this; when a man hath riches, that is, when the object is present and before him, a man cannot of himselfe but set his heart upon them; and when a mans heart is set upon them, no man in the world can weane his heart from those riches: what shall we doe then? Why, saith hee, the LORD hath an <hi>Allmighty</hi> power, he is able to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:15479:200"/>
these lusts. We can no more doe it, <hi>than a cable rope can goe through the eye of a needle.</hi> Now that which is said of riches, may be said of any lust. Let an ambitious man have honour, or such an object sutable to a carnall minde, hee cannot choose but set his heart upon it: now when that lust is set upon an object, <hi>a Camell may as well goe through a needle,</hi> as hee can loose his heart from these lusts: but yet the <hi>Lord</hi> can doe it, <hi>With him all things are possible.</hi> And what the Apostle saith of the <hi>Iewes, Rom.</hi> 11.23. The <hi>Lord</hi> can ingraft them in againe, as bad as they be, though the wrath of GOD be gone over them to the utmost, yet GOD can doe it: so is it true of thy selfe, and any one else, the <hi>Lord</hi> can, if hee will; to him nothing is impossible. Thinke with your selves, that he that can draw such beautifull flowers out of so dry an earth, as you looke upon in winter; though thou hast an heart as farre from grace, as the flowers seeme to be from comming forth in the midst of winter, yet he that can do so in nature, is able to doe the like in grace also, as he did to <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Mary Magdalen.</hi> Now consider what they would have beene without his power: and by his power we may be as excellent as they. To confirme this, consider what a change grace hath wrought even among us: how many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, that of proud have become humble, of fierce and cruell have become gentle; of loose, sober; of weake, strong, &amp;c. Goe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to him, beleeve this, and apply it: and it is
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:15479:201"/>
sure it <hi>shall be according to thy faith.</hi> If a man would goe to the <hi>Lord,</hi> and say to him, <hi>Lord,</hi> I have such a lust, and cannot overcome it, and I want griefe and sorrow for sinne, thou that hast an <hi>allmighty</hi> power, thou that didst draw light out of darknesse, thou art able to make such a change in my heart, thou hast an <hi>allmighty</hi> power, and to thee nothing is impossible.

power, then in the most desperate case, when there is no hope or helpe in the creature, that you can discerne, yet then pray, and pray strongly an confidently as men full of hope, to obtaine what they desire.</p>
            <p>And remember this for your comfort: At that time, when you are in affliction, and in so great a strait, that you are hedged about, and no hope, no possibility to evade, that is the time that the <hi>Lord</hi> will shew forth his power; for a man is never discouraged but in this case; I have seene it by many particular experiments: when the case hath beene desperate, when there hath beene no hope, yet when <hi>God</hi> hath beene sought to by fasting and prayer, there hath beene alteration above all thought, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that expression used, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.20: <hi>Hee is able to doe exceeding abundantly above all that we aske or thinke, according to the power that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in us:</hi> that is, when they could not enlarge their thoughts farre, nor were able to see there could be any way devised, yet enlarging their prayers, the LORD hath devised a way often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; I will give you some instances that the Scripture gives in this case. When <hi>Esau</hi> came against <hi>Iacob,</hi> was hee not in a fearefull strait; there was no hope, and no possibility, <hi>Esau</hi> was too strong for him; what should he doe now? he exposeth himselfe to the enemy, there was no other remedy; and it was an enmity of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares continuance, and the Text saith, <hi>that Iacob feared,</hi> and yet the LORD delivered him,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:15479:204"/>
when he had prayed to him. So when <hi>Laban</hi> came against him, GOD bid him that he should doe him no hurt. So <hi>Daniel,</hi> when he was cast into the Lions den, when all the Lions were present with their mouthes opened ready to devoure, yet the <hi>Lord</hi> stopped their mouthes, they could doe him no hurt. So is it in many cases amongst us; when our enemies are ready to devoure us, then GOD comes in in the nicke, betweene the cup, and the lip, and workes a way for our delivery. Therefore never be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged whatsoever thy case be: it is a very great matter to say, that the <hi>Lord</hi> can doe such a thing, though you thinke it but a small thing. As when the Leper could goe to <hi>Christ,</hi> and say, <hi>Lord, thou canst make me cleane if thou wilt,</hi> then the <hi>Lord</hi> did so. It was a great matter for those three children in <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. to be able to say, when the fire was ready prepared, and the King was wroth, and there was no resistance, yet they said, <hi>The Lord is able to save us out of thy hand O King!</hi> The LORD did take this so well at their hands, that the LORD did helpe them, and save them. On the contrary side, when a man doth doubt of his power, you shall see how much moment it is of. As that Prince said to <hi>Eliah, Though God should make windowes in heaven, yet there could not be such a plenty,</hi> as hee spake of: now the LORD was so displeased with it, that he destroyed him for it. So the <hi>Israelites</hi> did not beleeve that the LORD could bring them into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> therefore
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:15479:204"/>
the <hi>Lords</hi> anger was kindled against them for this: <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.</p>
            <p>But to draw this use to a conclusion. Learne to bring your hearts to this, whatsoever your case is, still to beleeve his power, and to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to say still, the <hi>Lord</hi> can doe it; and it is not a small matter to be able to say so. When the Churches are very low, and there is no hope, and you see little helpe, a man should goe and pray with such chearfulnesse and such hope, and confidence, as if it was the easiest thing in the world to helpe them; which you would doe, if you did beleeve that GOD is <hi>Allmigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> You know what the case of the Church was in <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> time, yet fasting and praying made a great change in the suddaine. Nay when the Church is downe, yet pray with as great hope, as if it had the best props to holde it up, for the <hi>Lord</hi> is able to raise it up againe.</p>
            <p>I will give you two instances, that you may consider the <hi>Lords</hi> power on both sides; his power to raise it up from a low condition; (as now, if you consider the miserable estate of the Church in Christendome at this time:) as it appeares by the vision of the dry bones in <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel:</hi> the meaning whereof is, that when the people are as low as low may be, like dead men, buried men, men scattered to the foure windes, yet saith the <hi>Lord,</hi> I will put life into them; I will raise them and make them a great army, and I will put grace into them, and make them living men; that is, though the Church
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:15479:205"/>
be never so low, yet the <hi>Lord</hi> can put life into it, and make a wonderfull change.</p>
            <p>Again, there is no Church so safe, (as we doe thinke our selves now, and as the <hi>Palatinate</hi> did thinke themselves) but that yet the <hi>Lord</hi> can make a sudden change, and bring them downe, as well as hee could raise these dry bones; and as he hath done to others already. This you shall see. <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.12. <hi>The Kings and all the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the world, would not have beleived, that the adversary and the enemy could have entred into the gates of Ierusalem.</hi> Ierusalem was so strong, there was such probability of safety, that no man would ever have beleived that the enemy and the adversary should ever have entred into the gates thereof. Yet the <hi>Allmighty</hi> power of GOD brought them downe on a suddaine, and laide them flat to the ground. Therefore let the case bee what it will bee, suppose a nation bee never so strong, yet GOD can bring them downe; and let it bee never so weake and low, yet the <hi>Lord</hi> is able to raise them up. And it is true of every particular thing also; then beleive this <hi>Allmighty</hi> power of GOD, and apply it, whatsoever thy case bee; consider that thou hast to doe with an <hi>Allmighty God.</hi>

As suppose a man hath a stone in the bladder, which we thinke an incurable disease, because the stone is so hard, and cannot be softened, yet it is possible to him; he can so lodge it, and bed it, that it shall doe you no hurt; and if he doe take away this life, yet he gives you a better; if it doe paine you here, yet he will give you joy and peace, which is farre better than to indure a little paine in the flesh. I say, you ought to doe as <hi>Christ</hi> did in this case; and remember this, that in such a case, your businesse is not with the power, but with the will of GOD: that is, you must say, <hi>Lord</hi> I know it is possible that this cup may passe, but <hi>Lord,</hi> here is all the matter; it is my desire that it should passe, and it may be it is thy will that it shall not, <hi>Lord,</hi> if this be the case, it is meet my will should yeeld, and that thy will should be done: As if Christ should have said, <hi>Lord,</hi> I will give thee this honour, that thou canst remove this cup from mee, but if thou doest not, it is not thy will to doe so; and I am content. So doe thou give the <hi>Lord</hi> this glory of his power in every case, that hee can doe it, if it be his will.</p>
            <p>Be it that thy desire is to be delivered from such or such an affliction; consider this: Is it

meete <hi>Gods</hi> will should yeeld to thine, or thine to his? Then bring thy heart downe, and be content that it should be so.</p>
