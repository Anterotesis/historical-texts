            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE LORD BALMERINO'S SPEECH, In the high Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in SCOTLAND.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lords,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Stand not up with a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition in my hand, for I have already a Petition in my mouth: Neither doe I annunciate any thing to my owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per gaine, but to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all accommodation of this whole Kingdome. For although a particular conſpiracy by ſome confederates was intended againſt my ſelfe, and other Noble members of this
<pb facs="tcp:96383:3"/>
Houſe; yet that very thing does not ſo much exaſperate me to ſpeake, as the epidemicall dangers impendent on this Nation. Behold how promiſcuouſly men wander in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted paths of Religion! Behold how prepoſterouſly our mortall enemies the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, doe not onely caſt their invective aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but alſo their intended malice againſt us! And ſhall we thus ſleepe in vindication? Shall we not exſtimulate the height of juſtice to thoſe that promerit worſe?</p>
            <p>It ſtrikes a repercuſſive ſtupidity into my minde to thinke of thoſe ſtratagems which they have forged, both for our beloved bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in England, and lately for the perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome in this illuſtrious aſſembly; and yet ſhall we ſtill permit the Popiſh recuſants to perfect in their former Hel-guided ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations? It is an old ſaying among the Latiniſts, but not ſo old as true, The impuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a fault does adde more courage to the offender; and I feare if we doe not curbe in time their extended malice, all things will grow to an higher Anarchie: The remiſſion of ſome faults, are the cauſe of the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of others; and if wee connive at their nefarious conſpiraces, wee doe in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner encourage them in their wicked procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
<pb facs="tcp:96383:3"/>
and ſo by ſubſequent concluſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our ſelves confederates unto them.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe, many of their accurſed crew are aggregated in Ireland, and by an irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar inſurrection, doe intend the utter demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of Chriſtian Religion. But God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees their erroneous imaginations, and will in due time (as wee truſt in his omnipotent juſtice) precipitate all their Babiloniſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents. Many may build Caſtles in the aire but to little effect, &amp; many likewiſe may aime at the ruine of Proteſtants, but although they be in ſtrength like <hi>Goliah,</hi> yet will the little ſtone of Religious <hi>David</hi> guided by Gods owne hand, maugre all their Gigantean puiſſance.</p>
            <p>My Lords, if my tongue have committed any error in its prolixity, and longinquity of words, that error ſhall wait upon your graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pardon: But this I am confident of, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I ever deſiſt from my opinion, that unleſſe we doe fully vindicate theſe malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Papiſts, theſe two Kingdoms both Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and England, cannot ſleepe long in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. If they doe not intend our ſubverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, why did they conſpire againſt us? If they doe not intend our ſubverſion, why have they ſo oftentimes plotted againſt Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?
<pb facs="tcp:96383:4"/>
If they doe not intend our ſubverſion why are they now gathered together in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, dayly ſtudying the demolition of this State and Kingdome?</p>
            <p>My Lords, aſſure your ſelves that theſe things cannot proceed from a good intent: And if you annect and conſummate all their conſpiraces into one bundle, you will finde them ſo various, and intricately numerous, that I am perſwaded that they themſelves can expect nothing but juſtice. Is it ſo then, that their very own actions do cry out for juſtice, why are we then ſo backward in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof? Is it ſo then, that revenge her ſelfe ſtands idle, why doe we not employ her? Is it ſo then, that the Kingdome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects a vindication, why doe wee then fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate them of their quotidian expectation?</p>
            <p>My Lords, I conceive it very expedient, that we ſhould leavy a ſufficient army to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell them, and if that will not ſuffice, then utterly to expell them, I am ſure and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent thereof, that England will conjoyne with us in munition, therefore let us labour with all expedition to beat downe their aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring malice: Let us not procraſtinate this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:96383:4"/>
leſt in the deferment hereof, God himſelfe be angry with us, whoſe cauſe wee ought to maintaine: What feare can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to oppoſe us, when the Almighty om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence will fight for us? Therefore let us raiſe a ſufficient Army againſt them, for no better cauſe can ever offer it ſelfe unto us, then the maintenance of true Religion.</p>
            <p>My Lords, I beſeech you weigh my words with your ſage gravity, and entertaine my hearty deſire with all your conſent here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; which hoping I ſhall obtain of you, theſe are my hopes, theſe are my wiſhes, and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe are my praiers.</p>
