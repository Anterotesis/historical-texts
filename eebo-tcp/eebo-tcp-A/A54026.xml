            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THere hath been an Enmity in the Seed of the Serpent again≈øt the Seed of the Woman, from the time of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe even until now. God in mercy to Mankind, hath given unto him ≈øince the Fall, a Seed or Principle of Life, in the Light and Strength whereof he is to war again≈øt and ≈øubdue the Corrupt Principle, and ≈øo be freed from the Cur≈øe, and become Heir of the Ble≈ø≈øing. Again≈øt this Principle all the Powers of Darkne≈øs fight (even in every particular man and woman) until they be overcome and ≈øubjected there: And again≈øt tho≈øe in whom this pure Principle reigns, all the Powers of Darkne≈øs in the world fight al≈øo, ≈øtriving to make it mi≈øerable, and to bring it into death and captivity, that they might keep up the content and happine≈øs of the Corrupt State. All the Nations of the Earth have alwayes warred again≈øt the Principle of God and the People of his choice. In the time of the Law, the Jews were the object of the Envy and Hatred of all the world: in the times of the Gospel, the Jews in Spirit were hated and hunted, in that day and hour, not only by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, but al≈øo by ≈øuch as were Jews according to the Letter; and ever ≈øince the Apo≈øtacy by Chri≈øtians al≈øo, according to the Letter, who are as great enemies to the Spirit &amp; Power as ever the Jews were.</p>
            <p>Now all the Mi≈øery of the World, as it at fir≈øt came by departing from the Principle of Life; ≈øo it hath been ever ≈øince continued by mens joyning with the Principle of Death and Corruption, to oppo≈øe and with≈øtand the workings of the Principle of Life, both in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves and others. VVhat man is there that hath not in him a Witne≈øs again≈øt that which is Evil? But where is that man, who joyns with this Witne≈øs in him again≈øt the Evil, and not with the Evil again≈øt this Witne≈øs? Oh how doth God's Witne≈øs reprove for Sin, making the heart (which is not ≈øen≈øual and bruti≈øh, but ≈øeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly con≈øiders its latter end) ≈øad becau≈øe of it! This is God's way of making the creature weary thereof, of weaning him from it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering him out of it, and ≈øo re≈øcuing him from the Wrath and Everla≈øting Burnings, which are the portion and inheritance of the Wicked. But who is it that doth not ≈øtrive to ≈øtop, ≈øilence and ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øs this Witne≈øs in him≈øelf, that he might enjoy his lusts, ea≈øe and content in the fle≈øh, by keeping the ≈øight and remembrance of the Evil-day far from him? And if he can do ≈øo, then he rejoyceth
<pb facs="tcp:31210:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and maketh merry over the Te≈øtimony of the Witne≈øs in him≈øelf; and when he hath ≈øo far prevailed, then he is in a good capacity to per≈øecute others, who hear and obey the Voice and Te≈øtimony there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in them≈øelves.</p>
            <p>That which is to redeem the World out of Mi≈øery, is the Power of the Go≈øpel: and precious is the Peace which comes thereby, after the work of the Spiritual Sword (with the trouble thereof) is fini≈øhed. O how ble≈ø≈øed would the Principle and Power of Life make the World, might it but have its free cour≈øe therein! O how happy is that man, who bears the Condemnation becau≈øe of Sin, follows the guidance of the living God, and waits for the day of his Salvation! O the ≈øweet inward Peace of Spirit which is enjoyed after the ≈øtorm, and after the Judgment of that which is to be judged and de≈øtroyed! And that which makes one per≈øon happy, the ≈øame mu≈øt make Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions happy. There is no true ≈øettlement nor abiding ≈øecurity, but in the ≈øetled and abiding Principle. God is ari≈øen to ≈øhake the Earth, and it can ≈øettle no more upon the old foundations: yea, the ≈øame God hath ≈øhriveled up the old Heavens, and they can no more be ≈øtretched forth again. <hi>Behold, I make all things new,</hi> ≈øaith the Lord in the days of the Go≈øpel, when he ≈øtretcheth forth the Arm of his Power: And who is he which ≈øhall venture to e≈øtabli≈øh the old Heavens and the old Earth, which the Lord God is removing and cau≈øing to pa≈ø≈øe away, and aboli≈øh the new Heavens and the new Earth, which the Lord God hath created and formed and is e≈øtabli≈øhing? O that men knew the place of Wi≈ødom, that they might be wi≈øe and not fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt their Creator, from whom their ≈øtrength comes, and against whom their ≈øtrength cannot prevail. O that men could ≈øee how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du≈øtrious they are to keep up Mi≈øery, and to keep out Happine≈øs. The eye of man (in the fallen and corrupt e≈øtate) cannot ≈øee aright: and mi≈ø-≈øeeing, how can he chu≈øe but mi≈ø-aim and mi≈ø-act? and mi≈ø-aiming and mi≈ø-acting, how can he attain his end? But the Lord's Coun≈øel ≈øhall ≈øtand, and he will fulfill all his plea≈øure in every heart and throughout the Earth. Happy is he who is weaned from him≈øelf, and begotten in the Light of Life which is incorruptible, he ≈øhall ≈øtand and be ble≈ø≈øed, when all fle≈øh falls before the Breath of the Lord and becomes mi≈øerable: and the fall of all the fle≈øhly will, wi≈ødom and ≈øtrength ha≈øtens apace; happy is he who is delivered from them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the day of their ruine, which is nearer than man is aware of, or can believe.</p>

               <head>3. <hi>The Nature of Per≈øecution, or What it is to Per≈øecute.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Per≈øecution is the oppo≈øition of the fle≈øh again≈øt the ≈øpirit. The fretting or da≈øhing of the earthly ≈øpirit, or ≈øpirit of man corrupted, again≈øt that which is born of God. The fighting of the unregenerate and unrenewed ≈øpirit in man, again≈øt the ≈øpirit of man renewed by the regenerating power of the Spirit of God. The fighting, the oppo≈øing of this ≈øpirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the other, is Per≈øecution. What ever any man does in his own will, according to his own wi≈ødom, and after the inclination of his own heart, again≈øt another who de≈øires to fear the Lord, (who waits on Him for the coun≈øel and guidance of His Spirit, that he might Obey and Wor≈øhip Him aright) is Per≈øecution. The Principle of God teaches to fear the Lord not according to the fear which is taught by the precepts of men, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fear which God puts into the heart; it teaches like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe to wor≈øhip the Lord, not according as man invents and thinks good to pre≈øcribe, but as the Lord in≈øtructs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; it teacheth likewi≈øe not to conform to the world, but to deny it, and come out of it: Now the hating, oppo≈øing, and puni≈øhing of that which is thus taught, becau≈øe of the≈øe teachings and its obedience thereto, this is Per≈øecution. The ri≈øing of the heart again≈øt ≈øuch, is Per≈øecution in the heart. The reproaching, ≈øcoffing at or ≈øpeaking evil of ≈øuch, is Per≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution with the tongue. (So <hi>I≈øhmael's</hi> mocking of <hi>I≈øaac,</hi> Gen. 21. 9, 10. is called Per≈øecuting of him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 29. 30.) The ≈ømiting, fining, impri≈øoning, of ≈øuch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in relation to any thing that they do from this Principle, is Per≈øecution with the

               <p>The Grounds and Cau≈øes which expo≈øe the one to Per≈øecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and kindle the heat of Per≈øecuting in the other, are chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the≈øe three en≈øuing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The enmity of the birth of the Fle≈øh again≈øt the birth of the Spirit. There is enmity in the Serpent again≈øt the Woman, and in the ≈øeed of the Serpent again≈øt the ≈øeed of the Woman. That which is born of the corrupt Principle cannot endure that which is born of the pure Principle. That which walks and wor≈øhips in the will and according to the inventions of man's wi≈ødom, and in ≈øhadows and fle≈øhly Forms plea≈øing to the fle≈øh, cannot endure that which wor≈øhips in Spirit and Truth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The contrariety of that which is born of God and drawn out of the world, to that which is of the fle≈øh (or of corrupt man) and left in the World, this is that which incen≈øeth, and draweth forth the enmity in the corrupt Principle. <hi>They are not of the world, even as I am not of the World,</hi> John 17. 16. <hi>Therefore the World hateth them,</hi> v. 14. They are of another Spirit, of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Image, of another Make, of another Heart, of another De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire, of another manner of Carriage and Demeanor, of another Principle, &amp; have other Ends in all they do, then the World: And their whole cour≈øe and conver≈øation (being in the Light and in the Love, &amp; in true Purity of Mind) reproves the world, which lies in the darkne≈øs and in the enmity, and walks in the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edne≈øs. And how can the world bear this, in the mid≈øt of all their height glory and greatne≈øs, to be continually reproved by a poor and contemptible Generation, as Gods choice in the world have for the generality of them always been, even looked upon by the world as the off-≈øcouring thereof, as not fit to be ≈øuffered to have a being in it, but rather as de≈øerving to be ≈øcowred off from it?</p>
               <p>The Light, whereof the Children of Light are born, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:31210:5"/>
which they hold forth (or rather, which God holds forth by them) condemns the World. The evenne≈øs, ≈øweetne≈øs, and ≈øtraitne≈øs of their conver≈øation and practices condemns the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evenne≈øs, crookednes &amp; perver≈øenes of the ≈øpirit of the World. The integrity, ≈øeriou≈øne≈øs and ≈øpirituality of their wor≈øhip (with the living power and pre≈øence of God, appearing among them) condemns the deadne≈øs, formality and hypocri≈øie of the wor≈øhips of the world, who draw nigh to God with their lips, when it is manife≈øt, that their hearts are far from Him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing en≈ønared, and captivated with Vanities and Self-intere≈øts, and love of the World and earthly things. Indeed the whole cour≈øe, and manife≈øtation of the Light and Power of God in them, is a continual upbraiding of the principle and ways of darkne≈øs in the men of the world. And how can the men of the world forbear making an unrighteous war, even a war of Per≈øecution again≈øt that which invades their territories and makes war with them in Righteou≈øne≈øs? Can darkne≈øs chu≈øe but fight to ≈øave its own dominions? It mu≈øt put out the Light or it cannot ≈øave its own, but will be lo≈øing ground daily.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becau≈øe of the Children of Light leaving and coming out of the world. They were once of the world, as well as others; Of the ≈øame nature, of the ≈øame ≈øpirit, of the ≈øame corrupt will, of the ≈øame corrupt wi≈ødom, walking in their way, wor≈øhipping according to their wor≈øhips, approving and ob≈øerving their cu≈øtoms, fa≈øhions and vanities. But when the Spirit of Chri≈øt called them out of the world, and created in them that which could hear his voice and was willing to follow him, then they left all the≈øe and ≈øtood Witne≈ø≈øes (in God's Spirit which called, and in that life which was begotten in them, and in the fear, love and power of that God who quickned them) again≈øt all the≈øe. And this mads the world, in that they were once of them, but left them. Had they ≈øtaid in the world, and been ≈øtill of the world, the world would have loved them, as it doth the re≈øt of its own: but departing from the world, travelling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another countrey, ≈øubjecting them≈øelves to another Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and te≈øtifying again≈øt that Spirit which formerly led them and ≈øtill leads the world, and again≈øt tho≈øe ways and practices wherein formerly they walked, and wherein the world ≈øtill

               <head>5. The Wayes and Means of Per≈øecution.</head>
               <p>The Wayes and Means of Per≈øecution, are very many. Who can want In≈øtruments to afflict the innocent and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs, who can neither re≈øi≈øt the evil which is offered them, nor harm that which offers it? I ≈øhall onely here mention three general heads, to which many particulars may be referred.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One great way of Per≈øecution is, by making u≈øe of Laws already made, either according to their proper tendency to that end and purpo≈øe, or by bending them a≈øide, from their proper intent, to reach tho≈øe whom they have a mind to afflict and per≈øecute. Thus the <hi>Jewes,</hi> when they had a mind to have Chri≈øt put to death, told <hi>Pilate, We have a Law, and by our Law he ought to die,</hi> John 19. <hi>7.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Another way is, by making new Laws fit for their purpo≈øe, whereby they may catch, en≈ønare and ≈øuppre≈øs that which is contrary to their ≈øpirit and principle, and which will not bow thereto. This is a certain way to take that which is born of God, and which cannot but be true to Him, and ≈øo cannot bow to the corrupt will of man, nor to any Law made in the corrupt will to ≈øtrengthen the corruption, and again≈øt the holy pure Will and Mind of God. Thus <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Three Children</hi> were caught in the ≈ønare by Laws, <hi>Daniel</hi> for praying to his God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the Royal Statute and firm Decree of the King, ≈øigned in writing, according to the de≈øire and advice of all the Pre≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of the Kingdom, the Governors, Princes, Coun≈øellors, and Captains, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 7, 8. and the <hi>Three Children</hi> for not wor≈øhipping the Image <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had ≈øet up, according to the Decree of the King. (ob≈øerve this by the way and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider it well. What hath been ≈øet up all this night of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtacy, but Images of the true Wor≈øhip? and what compelling hath there been thereto?) Thus have Articles been framed, and Statures made here in <hi>England,</hi> (as in King <hi>Henry,</hi> 8. and in Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> days) which have been great Engines of Per≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution: And thus have there been ≈øome late Laws made in New<hi>-England</hi> to the ≈øame Effect, though better might have
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:31210:6"/>
ju≈øtly been expected from them. And this is not only a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain way, but a very plau≈øible way likewi≈øe, whereby the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øecutor hides him≈øelf from the Imputation of Per≈øecution, and appears as a ju≈øt Executer of the Law; and ≈øo repre≈øents him, who is upright before God and innocent in the ≈øight of God, as an Offender and Breaker of the Law, and ≈øo ju≈øtly puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. But this will not alwayes cover the unju≈øt ≈øpirits Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øecution of the Ju≈øt. He that ≈øhall per≈øecute the Lord of Glory (as he that per≈øecuteth the lea≈øt Member of His, how contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible ≈øoever he appears to his eye, doth no le≈ø≈øe, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 4. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 40, 45.) when Chri≈øt ≈øhall call him to account; therefore it will be a vain plea for him to ≈øay, there was a Law for it, and he acted according to Law. It is fit for all Men and Laws to bow before the Lord, and not to di≈øturb any in their Obedience to the Lord, or hurt the Principle of his Life in any, but cheri≈øh and nur≈øe it up (as much as in them lies) in that tenderne≈øs which Chri≈øt begetteth in it, and in that ≈øpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Liberty which Chri≈øt allows it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third way of Per≈øecution is by the hand of Violence, without either Law, or ≈øo much as pretence to Law. Thus the per≈øecuting ≈øpirit, when it hath power in its hand, and is out of fear, ≈ømiteth (with the open fi≈øt of wickedne≈øs) that which is an Enemy to, and ≈øtands a Witne≈øs again≈øt its wickedne≈øs.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="section">
               <head>6. <hi>The Ends of Per≈øecution, or what the Per≈øecuting ≈øpirit aims at in its Per≈øecuting, and would fain attain thereby.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. The main end of Per≈øecution, is, to bring the Children of Light, (who have left the Evil, Darkne≈øs and Corruption of the World) back to the World again. That which they per≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them for, is, for leaving the World both in its <hi>principle</hi> and <hi>practices,</hi> and for profe≈ø≈øing obedience and ≈øubjection to another Spirit: That which they drive at in per≈øecuting them is, to force them back from under ≈øubjection to that Spirit which hath led them out of the World, into ≈øubjection to the ≈øpirit of the World again. There is a great fight between the Spirit of God and the ≈øpirit of the World, in the two Seeds; the Spirit of God ≈øtriving to bring the ≈øpirit of the World un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:31210:7"/>
and the ≈øpirit of the World ≈øtriving to bring the Spirit of God under. This is well known in the heart, where the new Birth is witne≈ø≈øed. O what ≈øtriving there is by the powers of Darkne≈øs, with all manner of ≈øecret Temptations and forcible Oppo≈øitions (≈øo far as the Lord permits) to bring the Heart (which the Lord hath begun to redeem, and in ≈øome mea≈øure ≈øet free from them) under their power again! And the ≈øame that ≈øtirs up the Darkne≈øs in the Heart again≈øt the Seed and Birth of Light there, the ≈øame ≈øtirs up the Darkne≈øs in other men again≈øt it al≈øo. The Lord knows what bitter fights we have had with the Enemy in our own Hearts, before we could leave our <hi>principles, paths</hi> and <hi>practices</hi> of Darkne≈øs, how hard it hath been to us to deny the World and come out of it: and yet when the Lord hath conquered and ≈øubjected the Darkne≈øs in our own hearts in any mea≈øure, then we meet with a new fight abroad in the World, the ≈øame Principle and Power in them fighting again≈øt us, as did at fir≈øt in our ≈øelves. And as this was the aim and work of the Power of Darkne≈øs in our ≈øelves (and ≈øtill is, ≈øo far as any of it is left in any of us) to bring us back under the Darkne≈øs again, even from the Light and Leadings of the Spirit, and from ≈øingle obedience thereto: ≈øo it is the aim and endeavour of the ≈øame ≈øpirit in others. And if they could but bring us back from our God into the World again, they would be at peace with us as well as with other men, and love and cheri≈øh us as they do the re≈øt of the World.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ≈øecond End of Per≈øecution in the ≈øpirit that per≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth, is, to keep the Children of Light from gaining further ground. The Kingdom of God and his Truth is of a growing ≈øpreading nature. It is like <hi>Leaven,</hi> like <hi>Salt,</hi> like <hi>the Light of the Morning;</hi> it's nature is to leaven, to ≈øea≈øon, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpread and gather Mankind from the Evil, from the Darkne≈øs, from the Corruption, from the Death and De≈øtruction. Now the ≈øpirit of the World, and that ≈øpirit which ruleth the World, is loth to lo≈øe ground; and therefore hunts and ≈øeeks to de≈øtroy the Ve≈ø≈øels wherein the Light appeareth, and from whom it ≈øhineth ≈øorth, and to make them appear as odious as they may, that they may keep all their own Territories and Dominions
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:31210:7"/>
in a perfect dete≈øtation of them, and di≈øtance from them. Thus though the People of God have ≈øtill been an innocent People, and ≈øimple as to the ≈øubtilty and deceit of the Serpent, and weak and fooli≈øh in compare with the wi≈øe and ≈øtrong ones in the worldly nature and ≈øpirit: yet they are ≈øtill repre≈øented as mo≈øt dangerous, mo≈øt ≈øubtile and pernicious, as ≈øhrewd Deceivers, Witches, Je≈øuites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea, any thing that is hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and hated.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third End of Per≈øecution, is, to afflict, grieve, vex, di≈øturb and torment tho≈øe, who≈øe Principles and Practices are di≈øplea≈øing to them. There is enmity in the nature and ≈øpirit of the World, again≈øt the holy pure Spirit and Seed of God: and if it cannot overcome and get its will one way in bringing back, yet it will ≈øtrive to have its will another way, even in vexing and afflicting. It is the plea≈øure of hatred or enmity to do any thing which may hurt that, again≈øt which its hatred is. Thus the evil ≈øpirit <hi>rejoyceth in iniquity,</hi> in grieving and afflicting that which is good. As the Spirit of Love delights in Love, and in doing good even to tho≈øe which per≈øecute: ≈øo the ≈øpirit of enmity delights in hatred and doing evil, even in vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and oppre≈ø≈øing tho≈øe which ≈øeek their good, becau≈øe they are not, nor cannot be one with them in their <hi>dark principles</hi> and <hi>evil practices.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>Per≈øecution is ≈øo hateful (and hath ≈øuch a blackne≈øs of ≈øpirit in it) that it cannot endure to appear in its own colour. Where is the man that would appear to per≈øecure that which is good in men, or men becau≈øe of their goodne≈øs? Therefore all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øecutors, though they ≈øtill per≈øecute that which is good, and tho≈øe which are good; yet they ≈øtill repre≈øent and charge them as evil, that they might thereby hide the badne≈øs and unju≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of their Per≈øecutions from their own eyes, and from the eyes of others. Thus the true Prophets of the Lord were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes mi≈ørepre≈øented by their Per≈øecutors, even as fal≈øe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, as <hi>Troublers of I≈ørael,</hi> as mad men, as men not fit to be

tolerated in the Kingdom or Commonwealth of <hi>I≈ørael:</hi> ≈øee <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. 26, 27. And tho≈øe which condemned their fore-fathers, for per≈øecuting the true Prophets in former dayes, yet could al≈øo per≈øecute the true Prophets in their own dayes. Chri≈øt him≈øelf, when he asked the <hi>Jews,</hi> for which of his good works they ≈øtoned him? They ≈øaid, <hi>Not for a good work,</hi> or <hi>as a good man;</hi> but <hi>for his doing evil,</hi> for his <hi>bla≈øphemy,</hi> in that he <hi>being a man, would make him≈øelf God, Joh.</hi> 10, 32, 33. And the Phari≈øees did not repre≈øent him as a good man, as an holy Teacher from God (as indeed He was, though his Doctrine and Conver≈øation differed very much from theirs) but as a Deceiver, a Seducer of the People, a mean man, the ≈øon of <hi>Jo≈øeph</hi> the Carpenter, one whom none of the wi≈øe Scribes owned, but only ≈øuch ≈øilly people as knew not the Law <hi>(Joh. 7.</hi> 49.) yea, as a very bad man, as one that was again≈øt the Wor≈øhip and Ordinances of <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> again≈øt God's Temple and Prie≈øts in his Doctrine and Principles, and a prophaner of God's holy Sabbath in his Practices: yea, more than this, they repre≈øented Him as a man that had a Devil; and when the mighty Power of God appeared in Him, they ≈øaid it was the power of the Devil, and that He was able to do ≈øuch great things beyond them, through the help of <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the Prince of Devils. Could the <hi>Jews</hi> think they did otherwi≈øe than well in de≈øiring ≈øuch a man as this to be put to death? might they not well prefer <hi>Barrabas</hi> before a man thus repre≈øented by their chief Prie≈øts and Teachers, who knew and could expound the Law, and were be≈øt able to judge (as they might well think) both what was the Truth, and who were Deceivers?</p>

Thus in the Apo≈øtles days, the Chri≈øtians (though meek, though ≈øweet, though pliable to the Spirit of God and to all good, yet) could not bow to ≈øo much as an appearance of evil any where, but ≈øhun and avoid it every where.
