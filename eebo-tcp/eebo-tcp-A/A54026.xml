            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THere hath been an Enmity in the Seed of the Serpent againſt the Seed of the Woman, from the time of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe even until now. God in mercy to Mankind, hath given unto him ſince the Fall, a Seed or Principle of Life, in the Light and Strength whereof he is to war againſt and ſubdue the Corrupt Principle, and ſo be freed from the Curſe, and become Heir of the Bleſſing. Againſt this Principle all the Powers of Darkneſs fight (even in every particular man and woman) until they be overcome and ſubjected there: And againſt thoſe in whom this pure Principle reigns, all the Powers of Darkneſs in the world fight alſo, ſtriving to make it miſerable, and to bring it into death and captivity, that they might keep up the content and happineſs of the Corrupt State. All the Nations of the Earth have alwayes warred againſt the Principle of God and the People of his choice. In the time of the Law, the Jews were the object of the Envy and Hatred of all the world: in the times of the Gospel, the Jews in Spirit were hated and hunted, in that day and hour, not only by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, but alſo by ſuch as were Jews according to the Letter; and ever ſince the Apoſtacy by Chriſtians alſo, according to the Letter, who are as great enemies to the Spirit &amp; Power as ever the Jews were.</p>
            <p>Now all the Miſery of the World, as it at firſt came by departing from the Principle of Life; ſo it hath been ever ſince continued by mens joyning with the Principle of Death and Corruption, to oppoſe and withſtand the workings of the Principle of Life, both in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others. VVhat man is there that hath not in him a Witneſs againſt that which is Evil? But where is that man, who joyns with this Witneſs in him againſt the Evil, and not with the Evil againſt this Witneſs? Oh how doth God's Witneſs reprove for Sin, making the heart (which is not ſenſual and brutiſh, but ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſiders its latter end) ſad becauſe of it! This is God's way of making the creature weary thereof, of weaning him from it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering him out of it, and ſo reſcuing him from the Wrath and Everlaſting Burnings, which are the portion and inheritance of the Wicked. But who is it that doth not ſtrive to ſtop, ſilence and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs this Witneſs in himſelf, that he might enjoy his lusts, eaſe and content in the fleſh, by keeping the ſight and remembrance of the Evil-day far from him? And if he can do ſo, then he rejoyceth
<pb facs="tcp:31210:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and maketh merry over the Teſtimony of the Witneſs in himſelf; and when he hath ſo far prevailed, then he is in a good capacity to perſecute others, who hear and obey the Voice and Teſtimony there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in themſelves.</p>
            <p>That which is to redeem the World out of Miſery, is the Power of the Goſpel: and precious is the Peace which comes thereby, after the work of the Spiritual Sword (with the trouble thereof) is finiſhed. O how bleſſed would the Principle and Power of Life make the World, might it but have its free courſe therein! O how happy is that man, who bears the Condemnation becauſe of Sin, follows the guidance of the living God, and waits for the day of his Salvation! O the ſweet inward Peace of Spirit which is enjoyed after the ſtorm, and after the Judgment of that which is to be judged and deſtroyed! And that which makes one perſon happy, the ſame muſt make Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions happy. There is no true ſettlement nor abiding ſecurity, but in the ſetled and abiding Principle. God is ariſen to ſhake the Earth, and it can ſettle no more upon the old foundations: yea, the ſame God hath ſhriveled up the old Heavens, and they can no more be ſtretched forth again. <hi>Behold, I make all things new,</hi> ſaith the Lord in the days of the Goſpel, when he ſtretcheth forth the Arm of his Power: And who is he which ſhall venture to eſtabliſh the old Heavens and the old Earth, which the Lord God is removing and cauſing to paſſe away, and aboliſh the new Heavens and the new Earth, which the Lord God hath created and formed and is eſtabliſhing? O that men knew the place of Wiſdom, that they might be wiſe and not fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Creator, from whom their ſtrength comes, and against whom their ſtrength cannot prevail. O that men could ſee how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious they are to keep up Miſery, and to keep out Happineſs. The eye of man (in the fallen and corrupt eſtate) cannot ſee aright: and miſ-ſeeing, how can he chuſe but miſ-aim and miſ-act? and miſ-aiming and miſ-acting, how can he attain his end? But the Lord's Counſel ſhall ſtand, and he will fulfill all his pleaſure in every heart and throughout the Earth. Happy is he who is weaned from himſelf, and begotten in the Light of Life which is incorruptible, he ſhall ſtand and be bleſſed, when all fleſh falls before the Breath of the Lord and becomes miſerable: and the fall of all the fleſhly will, wiſdom and ſtrength haſtens apace; happy is he who is delivered from them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the day of their ruine, which is nearer than man is aware of, or can believe.</p>

            <p>BEcauſe men, generally, in Perſecuting know not what they do (neither whom it is they Perſecute, nor how they ſin againſt God therein, nor what danger they are expoſing themſelves to, and what miſery they are drawing upon themſelves thereby, both in this World and for ever) even as Chriſt ſaid concerning the Jews, who were Perſecuting Him even to Death, <hi>Father forgive them, for they know not what they do:</hi> and afterward to <hi>Saul; Saul, Saul, why Perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> Therefore, in love to thoſe, who are at unawares running into this great Error, that they may find the good Hand of God ſtopping them therein for their own good, are theſe things following concerning Perſecution Written, wherein are manifeſted,</p>

He that is of another Spirit &amp; Principle than the World, &amp; ſo cannot be as the World is (being made otherwiſe by God) nor walk as the World walks, nor worſhip as the World worſhips, being taught and required of God to do otherwiſe, This is the man who is afflicted, reproached, hated, hunted, perſecuted. And ſo the Apoſtle laies it down, not only as a thing to be in his Age, but in after Ages alſo, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Yea and all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall ſuffer Perſecution.</hi> Men may talk of Chriſt, profeſs Chriſt, worſhip Chriſt according to the way that is ſet up in Nations, and avoid Perſecution; but come under the new Principle, come into his life, live Godly in Him, become really ſubject unto the Power and direction of his Spirit: then there is no longer avoiding of Perſecution. That which comes into the Life of Chriſt, comes preſently into a proportion of Suffering from that which is contrary to His Life.</p>

               <p>Perſecution is the oppoſition of the fleſh againſt the ſpirit. The fretting or daſhing of the earthly ſpirit, or ſpirit of man corrupted, againſt that which is born of God. The fighting of the unregenerate and unrenewed ſpirit in man, againſt the ſpirit of man renewed by the regenerating power of the Spirit of God. The fighting, the oppoſing of this ſpirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other, is Perſecution. What ever any man does in his own will, according to his own wiſdom, and after the inclination of his own heart, againſt another who deſires to fear the Lord, (who waits on Him for the counſel and guidance of His Spirit, that he might Obey and Worſhip Him aright) is Perſecution. The Principle of God teaches to fear the Lord not according to the fear which is taught by the precepts of men, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fear which God puts into the heart; it teaches like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to worſhip the Lord, not according as man invents and thinks good to preſcribe, but as the Lord inſtructs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; it teacheth likewiſe not to conform to the world, but to deny it, and come out of it: Now the hating, oppoſing, and puniſhing of that which is thus taught, becauſe of theſe teachings and its obedience thereto, this is Perſecution. The riſing of the heart againſt ſuch, is Perſecution in the heart. The reproaching, ſcoffing at or ſpeaking evil of ſuch, is Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution with the tongue. (So <hi>Iſhmael's</hi> mocking of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> Gen. 21. 9, 10. is called Perſecuting of him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 29. 30.) The ſmiting, fining, impriſoning, of ſuch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in relation to any thing that they do from this Principle, is Perſecution with the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:31210:5"/>
hand, or lifting up of the power either of a particular Perſon, or of a Magiſtrate againſt ſuch.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="section">
               <head>4. <hi>The Grounds of Perſecution, or what are the things that cauſe the one Spirit and Principle to Perſecute, and the other to be Perſecuted.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>The Grounds and Cauſes which expoſe the one to Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and kindle the heat of Perſecuting in the other, are chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe three enſuing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The enmity of the birth of the Fleſh againſt the birth of the Spirit. There is enmity in the Serpent againſt the Woman, and in the ſeed of the Serpent againſt the ſeed of the Woman. That which is born of the corrupt Principle cannot endure that which is born of the pure Principle. That which walks and worſhips in the will and according to the inventions of man's wiſdom, and in ſhadows and fleſhly Forms pleaſing to the fleſh, cannot endure that which worſhips in Spirit and Truth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The contrariety of that which is born of God and drawn out of the world, to that which is of the fleſh (or of corrupt man) and left in the World, this is that which incenſeth, and draweth forth the enmity in the corrupt Principle. <hi>They are not of the world, even as I am not of the World,</hi> John 17. 16. <hi>Therefore the World hateth them,</hi> v. 14. They are of another Spirit, of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Image, of another Make, of another Heart, of another De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, of another manner of Carriage and Demeanor, of another Principle, &amp; have other Ends in all they do, then the World: And their whole courſe and converſation (being in the Light and in the Love, &amp; in true Purity of Mind) reproves the world, which lies in the darkneſs and in the enmity, and walks in the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs. And how can the world bear this, in the midſt of all their height glory and greatneſs, to be continually reproved by a poor and contemptible Generation, as Gods choice in the world have for the generality of them always been, even looked upon by the world as the off-ſcouring thereof, as not fit to be ſuffered to have a being in it, but rather as deſerving to be ſcowred off from it?</p>
               <p>The Light, whereof the Children of Light are born, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:31210:5"/>
which they hold forth (or rather, which God holds forth by them) condemns the World. The evenneſs, ſweetneſs, and ſtraitneſs of their converſation and practices condemns the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evenneſs, crookednes &amp; perverſenes of the ſpirit of the World. The integrity, ſeriouſneſs and ſpirituality of their worſhip (with the living power and preſence of God, appearing among them) condemns the deadneſs, formality and hypocriſie of the worſhips of the world, who draw nigh to God with their lips, when it is manifeſt, that their hearts are far from Him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enſnared, and captivated with Vanities and Self-intereſts, and love of the World and earthly things. Indeed the whole courſe, and manifeſtation of the Light and Power of God in them, is a continual upbraiding of the principle and ways of darkneſs in the men of the world. And how can the men of the world forbear making an unrighteous war, even a war of Perſecution againſt that which invades their territories and makes war with them in Righteouſneſs? Can darkneſs chuſe but fight to ſave its own dominions? It muſt put out the Light or it cannot ſave its own, but will be loſing ground daily.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe of the Children of Light leaving and coming out of the world. They were once of the world, as well as others; Of the ſame nature, of the ſame ſpirit, of the ſame corrupt will, of the ſame corrupt wiſdom, walking in their way, worſhipping according to their worſhips, approving and obſerving their cuſtoms, faſhions and vanities. But when the Spirit of Chriſt called them out of the world, and created in them that which could hear his voice and was willing to follow him, then they left all theſe and ſtood Witneſſes (in God's Spirit which called, and in that life which was begotten in them, and in the fear, love and power of that God who quickned them) againſt all theſe. And this mads the world, in that they were once of them, but left them. Had they ſtaid in the world, and been ſtill of the world, the world would have loved them, as it doth the reſt of its own: but departing from the world, travelling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another countrey, ſubjecting themſelves to another Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and teſtifying againſt that Spirit which formerly led them and ſtill leads the world, and againſt thoſe ways and practices wherein formerly they walked, and wherein the world ſtill
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:31210:6"/>
walks; this fills the worldly ſpirit with rage againſt them.</p>

            <div n="5" type="section">
               <head>5. The Wayes and Means of Perſecution.</head>
               <p>The Wayes and Means of Perſecution, are very many. Who can want Inſtruments to afflict the innocent and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, who can neither reſiſt the evil which is offered them, nor harm that which offers it? I ſhall onely here mention three general heads, to which many particulars may be referred.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One great way of Perſecution is, by making uſe of Laws already made, either according to their proper tendency to that end and purpoſe, or by bending them aſide, from their proper intent, to reach thoſe whom they have a mind to afflict and perſecute. Thus the <hi>Jewes,</hi> when they had a mind to have Chriſt put to death, told <hi>Pilate, We have a Law, and by our Law he ought to die,</hi> John 19. <hi>7.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Another way is, by making new Laws fit for their purpoſe, whereby they may catch, enſnare and ſuppreſs that which is contrary to their ſpirit and principle, and which will not bow thereto. This is a certain way to take that which is born of God, and which cannot but be true to Him, and ſo cannot bow to the corrupt will of man, nor to any Law made in the corrupt will to ſtrengthen the corruption, and againſt the holy pure Will and Mind of God. Thus <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Three Children</hi> were caught in the ſnare by Laws, <hi>Daniel</hi> for praying to his God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Royal Statute and firm Decree of the King, ſigned in writing, according to the deſire and advice of all the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of the Kingdom, the Governors, Princes, Counſellors, and Captains, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 7, 8. and the <hi>Three Children</hi> for not worſhipping the Image <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had ſet up, according to the Decree of the King. (obſerve this by the way and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it well. What hath been ſet up all this night of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, but Images of the true Worſhip? and what compelling hath there been thereto?) Thus have Articles been framed, and Statures made here in <hi>England,</hi> (as in King <hi>Henry,</hi> 8. and in Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> days) which have been great Engines of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution: And thus have there been ſome late Laws made in New<hi>-England</hi> to the ſame Effect, though better might have
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:31210:6"/>
juſtly been expected from them. And this is not only a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain way, but a very plauſible way likewiſe, whereby the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor hides himſelf from the Imputation of Perſecution, and appears as a juſt Executer of the Law; and ſo repreſents him, who is upright before God and innocent in the ſight of God, as an Offender and Breaker of the Law, and ſo juſtly puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. But this will not alwayes cover the unjuſt ſpirits Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the Juſt. He that ſhall perſecute the Lord of Glory (as he that perſecuteth the leaſt Member of His, how contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible ſoever he appears to his eye, doth no leſſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 4. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 40, 45.) when Chriſt ſhall call him to account; therefore it will be a vain plea for him to ſay, there was a Law for it, and he acted according to Law. It is fit for all Men and Laws to bow before the Lord, and not to diſturb any in their Obedience to the Lord, or hurt the Principle of his Life in any, but cheriſh and nurſe it up (as much as in them lies) in that tenderneſs which Chriſt begetteth in it, and in that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Liberty which Chriſt allows it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third way of Perſecution is by the hand of Violence, without either Law, or ſo much as pretence to Law. Thus the perſecuting ſpirit, when it hath power in its hand, and is out of fear, ſmiteth (with the open fiſt of wickedneſs) that which is an Enemy to, and ſtands a Witneſs againſt its wickedneſs.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="section">
               <head>6. <hi>The Ends of Perſecution, or what the Perſecuting ſpirit aims at in its Perſecuting, and would fain attain thereby.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. The main end of Perſecution, is, to bring the Children of Light, (who have left the Evil, Darkneſs and Corruption of the World) back to the World again. That which they perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them for, is, for leaving the World both in its <hi>principle</hi> and <hi>practices,</hi> and for profeſſing obedience and ſubjection to another Spirit: That which they drive at in perſecuting them is, to force them back from under ſubjection to that Spirit which hath led them out of the World, into ſubjection to the ſpirit of the World again. There is a great fight between the Spirit of God and the ſpirit of the World, in the two Seeds; the Spirit of God ſtriving to bring the ſpirit of the World un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:31210:7"/>
and the ſpirit of the World ſtriving to bring the Spirit of God under. This is well known in the heart, where the new Birth is witneſſed. O what ſtriving there is by the powers of Darkneſs, with all manner of ſecret Temptations and forcible Oppoſitions (ſo far as the Lord permits) to bring the Heart (which the Lord hath begun to redeem, and in ſome meaſure ſet free from them) under their power again! And the ſame that ſtirs up the Darkneſs in the Heart againſt the Seed and Birth of Light there, the ſame ſtirs up the Darkneſs in other men againſt it alſo. The Lord knows what bitter fights we have had with the Enemy in our own Hearts, before we could leave our <hi>principles, paths</hi> and <hi>practices</hi> of Darkneſs, how hard it hath been to us to deny the World and come out of it: and yet when the Lord hath conquered and ſubjected the Darkneſs in our own hearts in any meaſure, then we meet with a new fight abroad in the World, the ſame Principle and Power in them fighting againſt us, as did at firſt in our ſelves. And as this was the aim and work of the Power of Darkneſs in our ſelves (and ſtill is, ſo far as any of it is left in any of us) to bring us back under the Darkneſs again, even from the Light and Leadings of the Spirit, and from ſingle obedience thereto: ſo it is the aim and endeavour of the ſame ſpirit in others. And if they could but bring us back from our God into the World again, they would be at peace with us as well as with other men, and love and cheriſh us as they do the reſt of the World.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond End of Perſecution in the ſpirit that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth, is, to keep the Children of Light from gaining further ground. The Kingdom of God and his Truth is of a growing ſpreading nature. It is like <hi>Leaven,</hi> like <hi>Salt,</hi> like <hi>the Light of the Morning;</hi> it's nature is to leaven, to ſeaſon, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread and gather Mankind from the Evil, from the Darkneſs, from the Corruption, from the Death and Deſtruction. Now the ſpirit of the World, and that ſpirit which ruleth the World, is loth to loſe ground; and therefore hunts and ſeeks to deſtroy the Veſſels wherein the Light appeareth, and from whom it ſhineth ſorth, and to make them appear as odious as they may, that they may keep all their own Territories and Dominions
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:31210:7"/>
in a perfect deteſtation of them, and diſtance from them. Thus though the People of God have ſtill been an innocent People, and ſimple as to the ſubtilty and deceit of the Serpent, and weak and fooliſh in compare with the wiſe and ſtrong ones in the worldly nature and ſpirit: yet they are ſtill repreſented as moſt dangerous, moſt ſubtile and pernicious, as ſhrewd Deceivers, Witches, Jeſuites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea, any thing that is hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and hated.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third End of Perſecution, is, to afflict, grieve, vex, diſturb and torment thoſe, whoſe Principles and Practices are diſpleaſing to them. There is enmity in the nature and ſpirit of the World, againſt the holy pure Spirit and Seed of God: and if it cannot overcome and get its will one way in bringing back, yet it will ſtrive to have its will another way, even in vexing and afflicting. It is the pleaſure of hatred or enmity to do any thing which may hurt that, againſt which its hatred is. Thus the evil ſpirit <hi>rejoyceth in iniquity,</hi> in grieving and afflicting that which is good. As the Spirit of Love delights in Love, and in doing good even to thoſe which perſecute: ſo the ſpirit of enmity delights in hatred and doing evil, even in vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and oppreſſing thoſe which ſeek their good, becauſe they are not, nor cannot be one with them in their <hi>dark principles</hi> and <hi>evil practices.</hi>
               </p>

            <div n="7" type="section">
               <head>7. <hi>The colour, or pretence which men put upon their Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that which is good.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Perſecution is ſo hateful (and hath ſuch a blackneſs of ſpirit in it) that it cannot endure to appear in its own colour. Where is the man that would appear to perſecure that which is good in men, or men becauſe of their goodneſs? Therefore all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, though they ſtill perſecute that which is good, and thoſe which are good; yet they ſtill repreſent and charge them as evil, that they might thereby hide the badneſs and unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Perſecutions from their own eyes, and from the eyes of others. Thus the true Prophets of the Lord were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes miſrepreſented by their Perſecutors, even as falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, as <hi>Troublers of Iſrael,</hi> as mad men, as men not fit to be
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:31210:8"/>
tolerated in the Kingdom or Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> ſee <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. 26, 27. And thoſe which condemned their fore-fathers, for perſecuting the true Prophets in former dayes, yet could alſo perſecute the true Prophets in their own dayes. Chriſt himſelf, when he asked the <hi>Jews,</hi> for which of his good works they ſtoned him? They ſaid, <hi>Not for a good work,</hi> or <hi>as a good man;</hi> but <hi>for his doing evil,</hi> for his <hi>blaſphemy,</hi> in that he <hi>being a man, would make himſelf God, Joh.</hi> 10, 32, 33. And the Phariſees did not repreſent him as a good man, as an holy Teacher from God (as indeed He was, though his Doctrine and Converſation differed very much from theirs) but as a Deceiver, a Seducer of the People, a mean man, the ſon of <hi>Joſeph</hi> the Carpenter, one whom none of the wiſe Scribes owned, but only ſuch ſilly people as knew not the Law <hi>(Joh. 7.</hi> 49.) yea, as a very bad man, as one that was againſt the Worſhip and Ordinances of <hi>Moſes,</hi> againſt God's Temple and Prieſts in his Doctrine and Principles, and a prophaner of God's holy Sabbath in his Practices: yea, more than this, they repreſented Him as a man that had a Devil; and when the mighty Power of God appeared in Him, they ſaid it was the power of the Devil, and that He was able to do ſuch great things beyond them, through the help of <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the Prince of Devils. Could the <hi>Jews</hi> think they did otherwiſe than well in deſiring ſuch a man as this to be put to death? might they not well prefer <hi>Barrabas</hi> before a man thus repreſented by their chief Prieſts and Teachers, who knew and could expound the Law, and were beſt able to judge (as they might well think) both what was the Truth, and who were Deceivers?</p>
            </div>
            <div n="8" type="section">
               <head>8. <hi>The Bleſſedneſſe of the Perſecuted.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>The Diſciple of Chriſt, who is perſecuted for Conſcience ſake, who ſuffers from men and their Laws for the upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his heart towards, and for his obedience unto Chriſt, that man is precious in the eye of Chriſt and hath his bleſſing with Him: yea, the more men diſeſteem and hate him upon this account, the greater is his bleſſedneſs. <hi>Bleſſed are ye when men ſhall revile you, and perſecute you, and ſhall ſay all manner of</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:31210:8"/>
                  <hi>Evil againſt you falſly for my ſake. Rejoyce and be exceeding glad, Matth.</hi> 5. 11, 12. He is bleſſed in ſeveral reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That man is in that Spirit and in that way which God hath choſen, and ſo he is in a happy ſtate and condition at preſent. He is in the path of Life, in the way of Peace, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Leadings of God's Spirit. The World loveth and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth that which is its own, that which is of it and walketh with it; but is at enmity and war with that which is of God. Therefore the World's Diſlike, Enmity and Perſecution is an evidence of God's choice, and of a Removal from it towards God. It is an happy thing in the eye of man, to be at unity with the World, to have the love and friendſhip thereof, to have all men ſpeak well of one, to be found doing that which is pleaſing in the eye of the World, and to be enjoying the pleaſures and profits thereof: but in the eye of God it is happy to be in unity with that which is contrary to the World, and procureth its ill-will. <hi>Love not the World, neither the things that are in the World. If any man love the World, the love of the Father</hi> (which begetteth out of the World) <hi>is not in him.</hi> But he that loſeth the love of the World (for the Principle of God and his ſubjection thereto) is in that which the Father lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, and feeleth the Love of the Father opened in him, and revealed to him: and this is truly an happy ſtate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Recompence, which God will give to them in the World to come, who cleave to Him and his Truth, for all the Perſecutions which they endure in this World for his Truth's ſake, is exceeding great. <hi>Great is your Reward in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 5. 14. <hi>Our light Affliction, which is but for a moment</hi> (but at moſt, for the time of this world) <hi>worketh for us a far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding eternal weight of Glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 17.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Reward is great in this world alſo. There is an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fold Recompence to be reaped in this life. The Peace of God in the Conſcience, the Preſence of God, the Life of God, the Vertue of God, the Glory of the Spirit of God (which accompanieth, reſteth with, and abideth on the heart which is faithful, and waiteth upon God for Patience, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Innocency and Strength to carry through the Sufferings) may well be valued at above an hundred fold Income and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence,

               </head>
               <p>It is a miſerable thing to be deceived about that which is good, to put <hi>Good</hi> for <hi>evil, Light</hi> for <hi>darkneſs, Sweet</hi> for <hi>bitter,</hi> and ſo (under a miſtake at leaſt) become a Perſecutor of the <hi>good.</hi> All <hi>good</hi> is of God, and he that is againſt <hi>good</hi> is againſt God; and it is a dreadful thing for the creature to ſet himſelf in battel againſt his Creator, and to engage the Power and Wrath of the Omnipotent One againſt him, though while the eye is ſhut, it doth not appear to men, either that they are againſt God, or that their danger is ſo great thereby, as indeed it is. The Children of God are as the Apple of his Eye: Who can touch them, and He not be deeply ſenſible? yea, and they are moſt dear to God in that, for which the World moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutes them. And therefore their danger and miſery muſt needs be great, which may further appear in theſe three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the weight of Wrath, which their Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of others here will bring upon themſelves in the world to come. Then every hard word, with every thing they have done againſt any Lamb of Chriſt's, ſhall come upon them. There is a time of Judgment for all that is ſowed in this world: and then every one ſhall reap what he hath ſowed. And if he that hath not viſited the ſick and impriſoned for Chriſt's ſake, ſhall hear that ſentence, <hi>Go ye our ſed, &amp;c.</hi> what will his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be, who hath impriſoned them and cauſed their ſickneſs? Now is our time of trouble; but the Lord hath prepared a day of reſt for that Spirit which is troubled in this world by the ſpirit of this world, and then ſhall the troubleſom ſpirit, which troubled the peaceable Spirit (and would give it no reſt in its following and obeying the Lord) be troubled by the Spirit of the Lord, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 6, 7. And what ſhall the miſery of that ſpirit be, whom the Spirit of the Lord troubleth and filleth with

anguiſh, and torments in his Fire and with his Brimſtone! Oh that men would awaken and conſider in time, and not fell away their everlaſting Inheritance for a meſs of Vanity and tranſitory Luſts and Pleaſures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The hand of God doth often overtake them in this world, and the Lord doth many times curſe their very Bleſſings to them, inſomuch as they cannot enjoy this world with that ſweetneſs and content they might, were it not for the rage and bitterneſs of their ſpirits againſt God's People, and their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking of God againſt them thereby. How many of his own People did <hi>Pharoah</hi> loſe, and how did he break the ſtrength and glory of his Kingdom, by perſecuting God's <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old? How did <hi>Amalek</hi> cauſe his name to be rooted out from under Heaven? How did the Nations and mighty Powers of the Earth fall upon this account, one after another? And in this Nation how many Powers have already fallen thereby! <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem is a burthenſome ſtone</hi> (it was ſo in the type, it is much more ſo in the ſubſtance) which lyes in the way of every earthly ſpirit and power, which they know not how to build with, neither can they rear up their own building becauſe of it, and therefore every Power ſtrives to remove it out of their way: but they know not the weight of it, nor who it is that hath ſquared it, nor how firm it is fixed upon the Rock.

The wayes that man takes to bring them back into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity ſhall be the means of perfecting their Redemption. <hi>Come,</hi> ſaid <hi>Pharoah, this People multiply too faſt, they grow more and mightier than we; let us deal wiſely with them, and keep them down by hard labour, leſt they grow over-numerous and joyn with our Enemies againſt us, when they ſee their advantage:</hi> But they grew and ſpread the more, upon his wiſe plotting and contriving to diminiſh them. And what did he get by ſtriving to keep them from going forth of his Land and Idolatrous Worſhips, to worſhip the Lord aright, but Plagues and Judgements upon himſelf and his People from the Lord? Can the Powers of the Earth withſtand God any more now, than they could for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly? ſhall not He redeem and bring forth his People from the Land of <hi>Babylon?</hi> His ſpiritual Iſrael from the ſpiritual <hi>Egypt?</hi> Shall He not break the Antichriſtian Yoak from their Conſciences, that they may be free in ſpirit to ſerve the Lord? Can any hinder God from breathing his Spirit upon People, and from begetting them in the image and likeneſs of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit unto Himſelf? And ſhall not theſe be the Lord's? ſhall not the ſame Spirit teach them to worſhip the Lord? ſhall God call them to worſhip Him openly, and ſhall they not obey him, but worſhip Him according to man's Inventions and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, or not at all publickly? Oh ye ſons of men be wiſe, do not contend with the Lord; be not bewitched by the <hi>Cup of Fornications,</hi> from the <hi>pure ſpiritual Worſhip</hi> of the living God, into <hi>Man's Inventions,</hi> which the Lord's Soul loaths; nor do not ſtrive to hold any back from the Lord, whom the Lord draws after Him: but conſider his Power, wait to know his Work in the world, and do not intrench upon his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but be thankful for and content with your own; and do not provoke Him againſt you, who can more eaſily take yours from you, than ye can His from Him. And conſider this <hi>Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word,</hi> in that which can open and ſhew the truth of it; <hi>The Lord hath put forth his Arm to recover his Poſſeſſions from out of the hands of Antichriſt:</hi> and who ſhall be able to force it back again, to make it return into His boſom without effecting what He ſtretched it forth for?</p>
               <p>Therefore, O Magiſtrates of this Nation, do not make uſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:31210:10"/>
of the Sword to ſuppreſs the Plants of God, but to cut down that which manifeſtly is not of God. Look abroad throughout this Nation, behold how much evil there is to grieve and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Lord, and to divert good from the Nation; and to bring wrath upon it and the Government thereof; ſtrike at that in righteous and true Judgment, and with mercy to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſouls and bodies: but that which certainly is of God, meddle not with; and that which may be of God, for ought ye know, be circumſpect in medling with, leſt ye engage God againſt you. It were better to let many Tares grow, than pluck up one Ear of Corn. Chriſt hath abſolutely expreſſed it to be his Mind, that he would not have that done, which may ſo much as hazard the plucking up of an Ear of Corn, <hi>(Mat.</hi> 13. 29.) But oh how are the Laws and Governments of this world to be lamented over (and oh what need there is of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation) whoſe common work it is to pluck up the Ears of Corn, and leave the Tares ſtanding! The chief cauſe of this miſery (from whence it principally ariſeth) is men's medling with thoſe things which God hath reſerved for Himſelf, and aſſaying to do that carnally, which God once did ſpiritually, and will do ſpiritually again in his due time, when He hath ſufficiently ſhewn how untoward and improper mans hand is to effect it. The Chriſtians in the Apoſtles dayes, were <hi>of one heart and one mind,</hi> which proceeded from the Power and Work of God upon them, and then they ſoon came into one Way and Worſhip: but men will have Unity and Uniformity in a way of Religion and Worſhip, before there is one heart and one mind. Now this is contrary to the Spirit of God and to the very nature of Religion, and the cauſe of much Cruelty upon mens Conſciences: and this hath been and will be the conſtant effect of it, even the cruſhing (as much as lies in man) of that which is tender, and of and for God, and the encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of that which is formal, dead and earthly. Now if ever Chriſt appointed or intended ſuch a Church-Government, which naturally produceth this effect, let all that fear God, and are of ſober ſpirits, judge.</p>

               <head>10. <hi>The way and means to avoid Perſecution.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Where is the man (in whom there is any good, who hath any love to Goodneſs and Righteouſneſs, who hateth Cruelty and Oppreſſion over mens outward Liberties and Eſtates, and much more over the Conſciences of People) that could not with his heart deſire to have this grand Enemy removed, both from particular perſons, and alſo from Governors and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that Peace and Settlement might be known, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs reaped, all Cruelty and Hardneſs in one man towards another removed, and there be <hi>no more complaining in our ſtreets,</hi> either becauſe of <hi>Oppreſſions from men,</hi> or <hi>fear of Wrath from God</hi> upon thoſe Governments which oppreſs? And who would not earneſtly pray to God for the diſcovery of that way and thoſe means, and be very induſtrious in the uſe of them, whereby this perſecuting ſpirit and temper might be waſted and dryed up in him? Now the way and means whereby the perſecuting ſpirit may be ſubdued, are divers, as,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>By a true Awe and Fear of God in the heart.</hi> The Fear of God teacheth to depart from Iniquity, and to ſeek the cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and bringing under of the worldly ſpirit in a man's ſelf, and to wait daily to have God's Will revealed, and likewiſe to be made obedient thereunto. Now he that is in this temper of ſpirit, will hardly be drawn to perſecute another, but rather rejoyce to ſee a tenderneſs of ſpirit in him, and true ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heart to what he believes to be the Mind and Will of God; and dares not ſo much as judge him for differing, either in Apprehenſions or Practices about Worſhip, much leſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute him therefore. But that man who is of a prophane ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or comes eaſily by his Religion (even by the wiſdom, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and parts of man, and not by the gift of God) and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in that Fear of God which is taught by the Precepts of men, but knoweth not that Fear which God puts in the heart (from whence the true Religion and Worſhip ſprings) either of theſe may be drawn to perſecute, yea indeed, it will be hard for either of them to abſtain there-from.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:31210:11"/>
2. <hi>By meckneſs of ſpirit.</hi> The Goſpel makes meek, tender, gentle, peaceable, fills with love and ſweetneſs of ſpirit, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to love, to forgive, to pray for and bleſs enemies: and how ſhall this man perſecute? Can a Lamb perſecute? Can a Dove perſecute? Indeed a Wolf in Sheeps clothing may raven and devour, but a true ſheep cannot. As the power of the Goſpel is known, the devouring and perſecuting nature is deſtroyed: and that being taken away, Perſecution ſoon comes to an end.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>By a ſober and patient conſideration of their cauſe whom they perſecute, and what it is in themſelves which moves them to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them.</hi> The ſtrength of Perſecution lies in the darknes, in the dark thoughts, miſ-judgings and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſions about him, whom one perſecutes or is inclined to perſecute, in prejudices, and falſe judgements of Perſons and things received: which by a ſober hearing and conſidering of things in God's fear and in meekneſs, might be removed; and then the eager Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting heat of ſpirit would ſoon abate and fall, the fewel (which kindled it) being taken away. <hi>The Jews ſtopped their ears and ran upon Stephen, Acts.</hi> 7. 57. This is the way of perſecuting ſpirits; They take in prejudices againſt perſons, their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Practices, ſtop their ears againſt what may be ſaid to manifeſt either the equity of the thing in its ſelf, or their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take about it, and then run headlong in their fury of perſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and devouring. But he that is ſober and conſiderate and weighs the cauſe before he engages againſt it, and obſerves what it is in him which moves ſo hotly againſt another, and which is ſo ready to believe ill aforehand: he ſhall ſoon ſee that, which is always hid from the eye of the Perſecutor, and find water to caſt on this devouring fire of ſpirit in him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>By a righteous frame of ſpirit, which is willing to do by another, as he would be done to in the like caſe.</hi> Perſecution ariſeth from unrighteouſneſs and ſelfiſhneſs; righteouſneſs and true equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would ſoon end it. If no man would make another man's Conſcience bow by force who would not have his own ſo bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Perſecution would ſoon ceaſe. But this is the great evil and unrighteouſneſs of man; whoever is uppermoſt, thinks he hath, right to bow all the reſt under him, and looks upon them as guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and offenders, if their Conſciences do not yield and bow
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:31210:12"/>
under him. And he that newly complained of the load laid on his Conſcience by others, yet if he can get eaſe and power into his hand, is preſently laying a load upon others. Here is a wrong frame of ſpirit within, and how can it chuſe but bring forth injury and Perſecution outwardly.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>By taking heed and watching againſt the corrupt and carnal, Principle, with the reaſonings, ſelf-ends and interests thereof, and hearkening to the Principle of God, which teacheth and ſpeaketh right Reaſon.</hi> Man, as he came from God and was by eſpecial favour formed in His Image: So it pleaſed God to place in him a Principle of His own Life to govern him. This Image was defaced by the fall, and this Principle forfeited, yet for Chriſt's ſake (who is the Saviour of all men, but eſpecially of them that believe) the Lord ſtirreth up and viſiteth all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind more or leſs, by the pure eternal Principle of His own Light and Life in Chriſt. In hearkening to this, man's reaſon is rectified, purified and preſerved pure; and his ſteps here are ſafe: But conſulting and contriving out of this, he meets with that which corrupts him (captivating and mis-byaſſing his reaſon) and then all his intents, deſignes and contrivances become corrupt, and tend not onely towards the prejudice of others at preſent, but alſo to his own loſs and detriment in the iſſue. He therefore that would be ſafe in the enjoyment of any bleſſing which he hath received from God, and faithful in doing him ſervice in his generation, muſt know what of himſelf is ready to betray him, that he may watch againſt it and turn from it, and what in himſelf is given him of God to enlighten, guide, inſtruct and preſerve him, that he may hearken thereto and be made happy thereby.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And Laſtly, To ſet it yet more home upon all that are ingenuous, and would be worthy and noble, and do that which is worthy and noble, abhorting cruelty, afflicting and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of others, let them conſider <hi>the fruits and effects of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,</hi> which are very many, and of the worſt kind, even ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the nature of the root. At preſent I ſhall onely men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion theſe four.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In a great degree <hi>it hindreth the growth of the preſent good in every age and generation,</hi> ſo far as the earthly power or ſword
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:31210:12"/>
of the Magiſtrate can well hinder. Perſecution of that which is good by the earthly Powers, in its proper tendency is an hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to the growth thereof in their age and day, though the Lord can overbear the malignity of it and further the growth of his Seed thereby.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It wholly tends towards hindring the ſhooting up of any further ſeeds of good, which God hath to ſaw in the earth:</hi> For all the ſeeds of good which God hath to ſow in the earth, at firſt they are looked upon as evil, until by God's bleſſing upon them, and opening of mens eyes through the much ſuffering of thoſe veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, in whom God cauſeth the moſt excellent ſeeds of his vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and goodneſs firſt to appear, their innocency and beauty begins at length to ſhine in mens eyes and be diſcerned.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It occaſioneth the growth of evil.</hi> For good withſtandeth, oppoſeth and chaſeth away evil, even as light doth darkneſs: and therefore the preventing of the ſpringing up of the good, is a cheriſhing and ſtrengthening of the evil. Beſides, the ſame Spirit, Government or Power, which perſecuteth and keepeth down the good under a pretence of its being evil, cannot chuſe but alſo cheriſh and nurſe up the evil, under a pretence of its being good. For the ſame eye, tongue and heart, that ſeeth, calleth and acknowledgeth that which is indeed good to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, cannot chuſe but alſo miſtake the evil and think it good.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>It draweth down the wrath of God upon People, Powers and Governments,</hi> where ſuch perſecution is; where the evil is cheriſhed under a pretence of its being good, and the good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to be ſuppreſſed under a pretence of its being evil. If men from their hearts do acknowledge the being of God, and His diſpoſal of things: then ſurely what is truly good in Perſons or Nations is of Him; and what is of Him, His eye is upon. He beholdeth the plants which He hath planted in the earth, and the plants which the envious one hath planted; and He cannot bleſs that Place, that People, thoſe Powers, that Government, where His plants are cruſhed, under a pretence of their not being His, and where the evil hature and plants are cheriſhed as if they were the good.</p>
               <p>Therefore he that would not be an enemy to God, an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to goodneſs, an enemy to himſelf, an enemy to mankind,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:31210:13"/>
and a friend and promoter of evil, let him wait on the Lord, for the fear of his Name and Power to be written on his Heart, and for a meek righteous frame of ſpirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his ſteps and the reaſonings of his mind, and not miſtake evil for good, and good for evil, and ſo perſecute men for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and doing that, which (might it have its courſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs) would make the world happy.</p>

Conſcience is of God; and tenderneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcienciouſneſs towards Him is neceſſary to the receiving of His pure fear, and towards the ſpringing up and growth of all good in the heart. The Seed of good is tender: and if it be not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into tender and well-prepared earth (but into thorny, ſtony or high-way ground) it cannot grow. And it cannot reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be ſuppoſed, to be the intent of God in appointing Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, that ever their Laws or Authority ſhould hurt that tenderneſs of Conſcience, wherein his ſeeds of good are ſown.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is true, The corrupt nature of man, which is ſelfiſh and ſeeketh covers for evil, may alſo ſeek this cover to hide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity under, and may pretend Conſcience when there is no matter of Conſcience at all, but ſelf-will and ſelf-ends at bottom.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Notwithſtanding this, God would not have the true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcienciouſneſs and tenderneſs in any of His cruſhed; nor can it be done by any Perſon, Authority or Law, without provoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God on the one hand, or without injury to ſuch who are ſo dealt with: <hi>Viz.</hi> Who are puniſhed by man for the exerciſe of that conſcientiouſneſs which is of God, and which he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and is pleaſing to Him.</p>

4. It were far better in it ſelf, ſafer for Governours, more agreeable to equity and righteous Government, and more pleaſing to God and good men, rather to ſuffer ſome (by their craft and falſe covers) to eſcape due puniſhment, then to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh thoſe who by the goodneſs, innocency and righteouſneſs which God hath planted in them) are exempted from puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Yea, it were better and much ſafer to ſpare many evil men, then to puniſh one good man: For mercy and ſparing (even of offenders) is natural to that which is good, but ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and puniſhments are unnatural, and but for neceſſities ſake. And as for that man, who by his ſubtilty and deceit thus eſcapes man's hand, he wil be no great gainer: For God, who is above all, will be ſure to meet with him. Yea that Magiſtrate (who ſpares ſome evil and evil-doers meerly upon this account, leſt he ſhould hurt that which is good) the Lord will help and bleſs; whereas that Power and Government which wilfully errs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the Lord may ſoon cut down: And that which errs thus through miſtake (it being a grievous miſtake to cut down the good in ſtead of the evil) the Lord, who loveth the good and hateth the evil, may eaſily be provoked againſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As Government came from God: ſo the righteous exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it depends upon God. Every man needs God's help daily, elſe he may eaſily erre in his courſe: and Governments and Governours need God's help much more, in the many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricacies and perplexities which they often meet with. And God is nigh to them in their difficult caſes, who wait upon him for counſel and direction. If the caſe be knotty, yet if God give wiſdom, hath the Magiſtrate cauſe to complain? And will not the Lord aſſiſt that Magiſtrate, who in his fear waits on him, and is not willing to ſpare the evil, and afraid to hurt the good? If there were not ſo much conſulting with man's wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and policy, (nor ſuch laying of deſigns and intents at firſt, as ſpring from man and not from God) but a naked upright waiting on him for inſtruction, who can onely guide the ſpirit of man aright, Governments would not prove ſo difficult, nor the ſucceſs therein ſo dangerous.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I freely confeſs, that (looking upon them with man's eye) it may eaſily appear ſo to man, who cannot ſee either whence that is, or what that is, which is wrought in their hearts by God. And how can I blame others for judging thus of them, when I my ſelf ſhould be liable ſo to judge, if I did ſo look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them? But yet, if I had patience to hear them, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the thing in the fear of God, (watching againſt that wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, from which the knowledge of the things of God and the ſtate of his People is hid) I ſee alſo, that there is ſome ground may appear unto man, to let him ſee that this is not ſuch a ſtiffneſs and ſtubborneſs of ſpirit as he judgeth, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth from, and neceſſarily accompanieth a true tenderneſs and conſcientiouſneſs towards God; which to make the more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to ſuch as are willing fairly to conſider the thing and know the truth thereof, I ſhall thus demonſtrate.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Stubbornneſs, or ſuch a kind of ſtiffneſs and reſolved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ariſeth from the ſtrength and corruption of the natural will and earthly wiſdom. The wiſdom which is from above is gentle, eaſie to be entreated: and the will which is created by God is mild and flexible, and eaſie to be led (by the leaſt child) in the line of goodneſs. And I can truly ſay this, that I never
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:31210:14"/>
in my whole courſe and converſation (who have long been a Spectator and un-intereſted perſon both as relating to the civil ſtate and the various profeſſions of Religion, till the power of Truth and preſence of God appearing in this People drew my heart after them) yea I cannot but ſay in the ſingleneſs of my heart, I never met with a more mild, gentle, flexible-ſpirited People. And he that can reach the ground of the thing, cannot but ſee it to be thus: For he that is daily exerciſed in denying his will and wiſdom, he on whoſe back the Lord lays the croſs and crucifies him every day, his ſelf-will and ſelf-wiſdom (with all the conceitedneſs and ſtiffneſs which ariſeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from) muſt needs be much broken in him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the tenderneſs and pliableneſs to good, which God begets, there is and cannot but be an unbendedneſs to evil. Conſider this, O ye that are wiſe: In the birth which God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets in the heart, in the immortal Seed of life, which God hath ſown and cauſeth to ſpring up in his heritage, there is a bowing to God at every appearance of good, accompanied with a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, gentleneſs and good will to man: But it cannot bow to that which is evil in any man upon the face of the earth. Read then this Riddle, with a true underſtanding: The tender one cannot yeild, the flexible one cannot bow, but naturally ſtandeth upright and ſtrait towards God, even in every thing it hath learned of him, and which he requireth of it. Thus in the Apoſtles days, the Chriſtians (though meek, though ſweet, though pliable to the Spirit of God and to all good, yet) could not bow to ſo much as an appearance of evil any where, but ſhun and avoid it every where. And if it were not for this kind of ſtiffneſs and unbendedneſs, the Children of God could never be preſerved in their departure out of the Worlds Spirit, Wayes, Worſhips and Practices: but would ſoon be enſnared and drawn back again, by the enticements and ſubtilties of the worldly nature either in themſelves or others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A ſtiffneſs then I grant, an unbendedneſs I grant; but not of the earthly, not of the ſelf-wil, nor according to the earthly: but ſuch as ariſeth from Truth in the heart, and from tenderneſs of Spirit towards God; ſuch as is begot in His fear, preſerved by his power, and is neceſſary towards their preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation

And if thoſe who are apt and liable to miſ-judge of them, did but ſee the ſincere deſire of their hearts not to offend man, but to be ſubject to the utmoſt according to the will of God, and knew what breathings there are in their hearts to God (in relation to the Magiſtrate, and when they appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Him) that they may be preſerved in the pure fear, and in righteouſneſs and inoffenſiveneſs, and how they cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to break any of God's commands, becauſe He is their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Lord, and they dare not diſobey Him to pleaſe man, or avoid their own ſufferings from man: I ſay, if men did ſee this, ſurely they would not call it ſtubbornneſs and ſelf-willedneſs, but a pure ſubjection and denial of the ſelf-will in God's fear, joyned with an holy and humble boldneſs in His power.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let it be equally conſidered, and it will ſoon be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, That the leaſt thing which God requires (the Command being from ſo great a King, upon whom the ſoul hath ſo great dependance, from whom it hath ſo great hopes, and to whom univerſal obedience is ſo due in it ſelf and ſo profitable to the creature) is exceeding weighty: and it is impoſſible for the fear of Him and due tenderneſs towards His Commands, to be preſerved, without a ſtrict and cloſe giving up the Will to Him, and ſtanding in His ſtrength, ſtrong and unbended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all temptations, provocations, allurements and affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the contrary. (and how eaſily may men call this ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borneſs and ſtiffneſs.) But this they receive from God, as well as the law of obedience and power to obey; and this (which men call ſtubborneſs) flows in upon them from him, when they are in the ſweeteſt and meekeſt frame of ſpirit, moſt ready to deny themſelves and to yield up their own wills, to whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is good and righteous, and ſo of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The ſame thing, which is offended at this unbendedneſs and reſolvedneſs, which is wrought and preſerved in them by the fear of God (calling it by way of reproach, ſtiffneſs and ſtubborneſs) I ſay, the very ſame thing will commend that reſolution and ſtiffneſs, which is taken up in man's wiſdom, and held in man's will. Is it not good to weigh and conſider things reaſonably, and then to chuſe and hold faſt to thoſe Principles
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:31210:15"/>
which appear moſt reaſonable? what man, but will ſay it is? And is it not good to obey and keep to that Light which is higher than Reaſon, which comprehends Reaſon, rectifying and preſerving it, making it profitable and ſerviceable to God which made it, to the Veſſel in which it is, and to the reſt of the Creation? But <hi>Wiſdom is juſtified of her Children.</hi> He that knows not the Principle of the Eternal Light, who is not born of it (much leſs by unfeigned obedience and ſubjection formed into it) he cannot juſtifie it in his Paths: but he juſtifies the earthly wiſdom and reaſon of man, by it ſetting up <hi>appearances</hi> of <hi>Good,</hi> inſtead <hi>of Good,</hi> and would make all acknowledge and bow to them <hi>as Good:</hi> whereas that which is indeed acquainted with the <hi>Good,</hi> living in the Principle thereof, cannot bow to the falſe Appearance, but only to the Truth it ſelf. When man's ſpirit and wiſdom is wearied out of all its paths, and he broken with the miſery which will certainly overtake him therein, at laſt the Path of God will be welcome to him, and that Principle which (through the operation of God) is able to rectifie him and make him happy.</p>
               <p>There hath long been a Peace and Proſperity throughout the world in Unrighteouſneſs: but the ſeaſon is at length come for the breaking thereof, and now there is not to be ſuch a ſetled falſe Peace in Unrighteouſneſs any longer; but Tribulation, Anguiſh and Deſtruction is coming upon the ſelfiſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt ſpirit: and he that refuſeth the Path of Righteouſneſs, muſt not know Peace, but be overtaken with the over-flowing ſcourge, and ſwept into and ſhut up in the pit, which hath long been digging for the wicked <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 94. 13.) and mark this thing following, ye that would not find your ſelves deceived of your ſouls hereafter, nor of your outward Peace and Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity here: for it deeply concerns both.</p>
               <p>The Spirit of the Lord once raiſed up a ſpiritual building, which the ſpirit of the Dragon overturned (as to its outward ſtate: though the gates of Hell could not prevail againſt the being and inward ſtate of the true Church) and inſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſet up an earthly Image, agreeable to the earthly ſpirit in Nations, but burthenſom to that which is innocent, pure and ſpiritual. The Lord God ſuffered this to ſtand all its allotted
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:31210:16"/>
time, and to have power to keep down the Viſibility of His Truth and People: but the Lord hath appointed a ſeaſon to raiſe up his own Building again, and to throw down this Image. Now this I ſay to all men, in the Fear and Dread of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, Stand ſtill and mark, if all the power of man be able to keep down God's ſpiritual Building which he is raiſing up, or to keep up any part of the earthly Image which He is throwing down. The ſpirit of man (in various wayes) hath ſhewed, what it judgeth beſt to have down and to have up, and hath put forth its ſtrength to accompliſh its will and counſel: Stand ſtill a while and ye ſhall ſee, that the Spirit of the Lord will alſo ſhew what He would have down, and what He would have up, and He will alſo put forth His ſtrength to accompliſh His Will and Counſel. It is the Glory and Honour of the Lord to carry on His Work in the midſt of all the Oppoſitions of man, and againſt the full current of his ſtrength and will. This will make it to appear to be of God, and cauſe the Glory of his Name to ſhine. O that men could fear the Lord and bow before Him, that He might be honoured in them, and ſee good to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them in the carrying on of His Work, and ſo might not be forced (through their hearkening to the dark ſpirit, and becauſe of their ignorance of, and diſobedience to the Light of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) to get Himſelf a Name by overturning their ſtrength and Councils, and cauſing his Glory to ſhine over them.</p>
               <p>We have been a poor oppreſſed People, from the day that the Power of the Lord brake forth upon us, and his Light ſprang in us, even until now. And now we are brought lower than ever, and are in greater danger (to the eye of man) than ever. Yet our confidence is ſtill in our God: and this we are certain of, that our Principle (and Practices there-from) ſhall ſtand, and man ſhall not be able to prevail againſt it: for God will preſerve his People in his Life and Power, and the heads of all that wait upon Him in his Fear, ſhall be lift up above all the ſwellings of the Waters; yea, a ſong of Praiſe is already prepared in the hearts of God's Choſen, againſt the day of his Deliverance. We look not out, but give up our backs to the ſmiter, as if their ſtroaks were never to have an end: and yet we wait on our God and hope in Him, as if Deliverance were
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:31210:16"/>
ſpringing up every moment. And, Oh that God would ſmite the ſpirit of Enmity and Darkneſs in Men and Powers, and then there would be Love, Peace, purſuing after God and Righteouſneſs, and no more <hi>perſecuting</hi> and <hi>ſmiting</hi> of God's People for the Uprightneſs of their hearts, and for their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Faithfulneſs to Him. But be it known throughout all the Earth, We are the Lord's, and we muſt worſhip and ſerve Him. He hath redeemed us (even all of us in ſome meaſure, who have known Unity with His living Truth) in ſoul, in body and ſpirit: and they muſt all be His in the firſt place, and cannot bow to man (in the leaſt) againſt His Will, or contrary to the Law of his pure Life, and Leadings of his Spirit in the heart. Here is our ſtanding, in the ſtrength of our God, whatever become of us. And here we ſtand in love and good-will to mankind, yea to theſe preſent Powers, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they judge of us; and have been praying for them, and mourning over them, while they have been ſmiting of us. And when they have drawn the Hand of the Lord upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; if the Lord ſhall pleaſe to open their eyes to ſee what we have been towards them (and how fain we would have had them ſet footing there, where they might have ſtood firm and have been preſerved) they will bewail as much their dealings with us, as what will befall themſelves. The Lord will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt all things in his Time, and give his Truth a paſſage in the Earth, and his People a quiet habitation therein, how black ſoever the face of things now appear, as relating to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>O how happy will the Day be when the Lord ſhall have wrought down the ſelfiſh ſpirit in man, and ſhall have rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up His own Noble and Equal Principle. Then ſhall Righteouſneſs ſpring up and ſpread abroad throughout the Nations: and the work of Righteouſneſs ſhall be Peace, and the effect of Righteouſneſs Quietneſs and Aſſurance for ever.</q>
