            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Saith this Erroneous Opinion, That the uſe of the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is <hi>Sinfull, Superſtitious,</hi> and <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> was one of the greateſt cauſes of thoſe horrid <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtions</hi> in this Church and State, which <hi>HE</hi> by whom <hi>KINGS Reign</hi> has ſo wonderfully <hi>Suppreſt,</hi> and we hope in time will quite <hi>Extinguiſh.</hi> I cannot but eſteem thoſe men as notorious <hi>Incendiaries,</hi> who endeavour ſtill to keep the people they have already <hi>Seduced,</hi> in this Factious Opinion, and continually to draw others into it. I boldly appeal to the Judgement of all <hi>Impartial</hi> men upon the face of the Earth, whether theſe two opinions which uſually go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Viz.</hi> that the people may fight againſt their lawfull Prince, ſo it be for <hi>Reformation,</hi> &amp;c. and that our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to publick Worſhip, is ſinfull and Antichriſtian, ſo bad that tis neceſſary it ſhould be Reformed, do not tend directly to the ſtirring up of a new Rebellion? Yea, was not this Opinion the <hi>Entrance</hi> into that <hi>Labyrinth</hi> of Error, wherein thoſe Wretches had <hi>Loſt</hi> themſelves, who were lately <hi>Drawn, Hangd,</hi> and <hi>Quarterd</hi> for being in <hi>Actuall</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt him, who has hitherto appeard to be not only the moſt Gracious of Princes, but alſo the Meekeſt of <hi>Men?</hi> But it may be you will ſay, <hi>That you do not teach the People that it may be lawfull for them in ſome caſes to take up Arms againſt their King:</hi> but you plainly do that which is almoſt as bad: You endeavour to perſwade the People, that <hi>That way of Worſhipping God in publick, which is practiſed by the King and the Biſhops, is ſinful, and by conſequence, that there is a very great need of Reformation in our Church;</hi> Which <hi>Imagination</hi> was one of the Roots and Principles of our late <hi>Rebellion;</hi> and in the mean time it is moſt evident that you <hi>Connive</hi> (at leſt) at this Curſed Opinion, <hi>That in caſe there be need of a</hi> Reformation, <hi>the People may juſtly take up Arms against their Lawfull SOVERAIGNE, if it may not be affected by other means.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have briefly diſcovered the <hi>Conſiderations,</hi> which moved me to make this Addreſs unto you, To <hi>Charge you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that you be not ſo <hi>Raſh</hi> and <hi>Precipitant</hi> in endeavouring to engage the mindes of

the ignorant Vulgar in ſuch averſeneſs to that excellent <hi>Set-form</hi> of prayer, which was compoſed, and is ſtill uſed by ſo many men of Eminence for Parts, and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Piety, whereas moſt of the Arguments which you produce againſt it, are ſo notoriouſly weak and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, that I cannot but fear that the moſt learned of you do not believe your ſelves thoſe things to be Truthes, which you would impoſe as ſuch upon the Mindes of others. What an Argument is this (which ſome of you have Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) that the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> cannot pleaſe God, becauſe it pleaſes the Papiſts: (which I have anſwered, or rather expos'd to contempt, in a ſmall Treatiſe I lately publiſhed?) What an Argument is this againſt that excellent Hymn, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled <hi>Te Deum,</hi> which (who that loves the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in Sincerity can poſſibly read or hear, but muſt needs be affected with ſome Spiritual Delight in attending unto it?) <hi>That <note n="*" place="margin">Reaſons ſhewing the neceſsiry of Reformation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> P. 27.</note> it is a piece ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the Maſs-Book.</hi> If you meant that twas compoſed by a Papiſt, tis unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly falſe: If you mean that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> make uſe of it in their publick Worſhip, may you not Argue in the ſame maner againſt the uſe of many portions of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture? But ſuppoſe it had been compoſed by a Papiſt: ſhall we not make uſe of that which in it ſelf is intirely good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had ſome bad opinions who was the Author of it? Oh, <hi>bluſh,</hi> &amp; be <hi>aſhamed,</hi> that ever you publiſhed ſuch <hi>Folly</hi> as this. Some of you have ſaid that this part of the Letany, <hi>By <note n="*" place="margin">Common-Prayer-Book unmasked.

ever compoſe that are more apt to bring the ſouls of thoſe that hear or reed them, to an <hi>Inward Spiritual Senſe</hi> of the mercy of God in CHRIST, in which conſiſts the very <hi>Eſſence</hi> and <hi>Formality</hi> of true Prayer, or of the Worſhiping of God <hi>in Spirit and in Truth?</hi> Surely I fear that thoſe men who wrote this Pamphlet, had not <hi>Felt the power of Godlineſs</hi> working in their ſouls through a <hi>Faithful,</hi> or <hi>Practical</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, or underſtanding of the <hi>Perſon</hi> of the Glorious <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>Rather then I would believe that this part of the Letany is no better then <hi>Conjuring,</hi> &amp;c.
