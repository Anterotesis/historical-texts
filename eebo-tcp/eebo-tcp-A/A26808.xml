            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Argument before us recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
it self as from its Nature
and Quality, for true Happiness
is the first and last in the order of
things desireable; the first for its attractive
Excellence, the last in its consummate Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition;
so upon this most valuable account,
that it nearly concerns every Person. For
Happiness is not restrained to any peculiar
rank of Men, but may equally and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
be possest by all that sincerely apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to obtain it. If in the very different
States of Life here, there were any uncapable
of Eternal Life, or that have another Object
for their last end, there might be some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why they should not feel their desires in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd,
and Spirits moved towards Celestial
Felicity, and to justify their sole Pretensions
to the things of Time, whereto their Interests
are confin'd. But the offer of Heaven com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
all that upon God's Terms will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99572:3"/>
it. The most sensible inequality that
Riches, Dignity, or any other Temporal
Accident makes between Men here, is
so true a Nothing in comparison of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Glory, that it makes no difference
of one from another as to the obtaining
of it.</p>
            <p>Besides the universal respect wherein the
Doctrine of Eternal Salvation concerns all
Men as capable of it, 'tis also of admirable
use to their various Conditions Temporal
and Spiritual. For the prosperous or afflicted
in the World; the Strangers to serious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
or the experienc'd in the Affairs of
the Soul; the newly entred into a state of
Grace, or the greatest Proficients, may find
what is suitable to them in the consideration
of it. As the quickning Influences of Heaven
are appropriated to the divers Qualities of
Fruits, with that discreet Operation, that the
hard are soften'd, the small acquire growth
and substance, the Green are colour'd and
made beautiful, the harsh become pleasant, and
receive their fragrancy and full maturity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Thus the virtue of the Celestial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is powerful to reform the obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in Evil, and to encourage the
irresolute in Good, to produce the first
Life of Holiness, and to cherish and
strengthen it till it comes to perfection.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99572:3"/>
Happiness is the Spring and Crown of our
Obedience.</p>
            <p>I shall only add this, That no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
has more exercised the Minds of the
wisest and best Men, than the last End
and highest Good of Man: and that in
the managing of this most necessary Subjest,
I have selected some things from their
Writings, that were proper to my Design,
which I acknowledg with that candor as if
I had particularly named them.</p>

            <head type="sub">The generality of Men pursue a false Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.
The causes of their mistake.
Rules to direct in the search after the
blessed End of Man. The Wisdom and
Goodness of the Creator, the frame of
Man's Nature, and the Holy Scriptures
discover it. The things of the World are
defective, in all the essential Conditions
requisite to Man's Felicity. God alone
who is a spiritual infinite eternal Good,
can make him perfectly blessed.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT the Inclination to
Happiness is as universal
as the Human Nature,
we have the clearest te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
from the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of all Men. This
inclination is neither cold nor barren,
but vigorously exerts it self in motions
of flight, and aversation from what is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
as Evil, and in the pursuit of
what is conceived under the appearance
of Good. From hence proceeds the
unwearied Industry of Men in using
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99572:5"/>
means to accomplish their general End.
Some waste their Time and Strength in
an eager pursuit of sensual Pleasures,
and Riches, and Dignities; Others in
acquiring the more valuable Treasures
of Knowledg, or in purchasing an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Reputation, as if the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of these things were the cure of their
distempered Desires. But the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of all particular Goods that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
the Soul within the Sphere of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or that preserve and delight the
Body, cannot afford true Content. The
Heart still remains empty, and langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes
for Satisfaction. 'Tis therefore a
just cause of wonder, that an intelligent
Creature finding the product of all his
Diligence unanswerable to his Hopes,
should vainly seek for Happiness where
'tis not to be found; and after innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
disappointments fly at an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility.
An Error in the first enquiry
might have some colour of excuse, but
that having been so often deceived with
painted Grapes for the Fruits of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
Men should still seek for substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Blessedness to fill the Soul, in vain
shows that can only feed the Eye, is
Madness exceeding all Admiration.
What powerful charm obstructs their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99572:5"/>
true judging of things? What Spirit of
Error possess them? The only Account
that can be given of it is this: Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fallen from the Holiness and Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of his Original State, the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are vitiously inclined to sensible
things, and the fumes arising from car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Lusts cloud and overshade the Mind,
and hinder its clear discovery of that
universal comprehensive Good in whose
Fruition true Happiness consists, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he earnestly applies himself to please
the lower Faculties, allur'd by present
Delights, and the facility of obtaining
them.</p>
            <p>And from hence we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that the only way of their reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
is by clearing the Mind from Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and Folly, that it may discern the
sole proper object of the rational Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
in its true Beauty and Goodness,
and by that sight the Will may feel its
ravishing Power, and be drawn to a
free and firm choice of it. And that the
Soul may not faint under the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of insuperable difficulties interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
between it and the obtaining of
its Happiness, and therefore content it
self with easy Vanities, to propound
such means that sincerely used will be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99572:6"/>
effectual, and offer it that assistance
that will make it finally victorious over
all opposition.</p>
            <p>Thus the two leading Faculties being
turn'd from the Creature to God, the
inferior Wheels will follow their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the Conversation be intirely
chang'd. In order to this happy work
the following Discourses were compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
wherein are represented those rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
from the Dignity, Capacity, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
of Man's Soul, and from the
essential conditions of his Felicity; that
impartially considered by the Men of
the World, who prefer Earth before
Heaven, will discover the vanity of
their Designs, and check the fury of
their Prosecutions, and turn their Aims
and endeavours to that that is infinitely
more worthy of them. But the real
effecting this belongss solely to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Power, who purchased Heaven
for us.</p>
            <p>O thou Sun and Life of Souls, shed
abroad thy Light and Vital Heat, the
belief of the Truth of unseen things,
and the love of their superlative Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the Minds and Hearts of Men,
that they may not frame to themselves
an imaginary Happiness in the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99572:6"/>
of this perishing Life, but with
that zeal and vigour in their Affections
and Actions seek after the real Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the future Life, as becomes an
Object so glorious and eternal.</p>
            <p>In treating of this Subject, our first
inquiry is, What is the blessed End for
which Man was created? This we may
clearly discover; by considering three
things.</p>
            <p>1. The Wisdom and Goodness of the
Creator, who made all things in order
to some End worthy his Perfections.</p>
            <p>2. The Human Nature in its highest
Faculties, and their utmost Capacities.</p>
            <p>3. The Revelation of it in God's
Word. Natural Light gives a real sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of God's Intention by the two
first: but the most clear and full is in
the Holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>I will treat of them in their order.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The working of God is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
with some design of High Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
He did not create the World
and Man by chance, nor as a Seal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
its Figure without knowing
what is stampt. But he works always
by Counsel and Election, knowing
what he does, and for what End.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99572:7"/>
Now the last Period wherein all his
Works determine, is his own Glory, that
being the chiefest Good. He made
great variety of Creatures, and bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Provisions for their Happiness, ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately
for his own Pleasure. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his Wisdom and most free
Goodness, he was pleased that the
World should not only be filled with
material and sensitive Beings, that obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively
glorify him, by the reflex of
the Divine Perfections appearing in
them, but to frame a higher rank of
Creatures, wherein the Image of his
Excellencies was more conspicuous, and
that might actively glorify him, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
and magnifying, by loving
and obeying Him. And as the several
kinds of things have degrees of Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
they are subordinate in their use:
the simple to the compounded, the dead
to the living, the lower Natures to the
more Noble. By this we may take an
estimate of their Dignity and Order.
Now for whom was this vast Fabrick
raised, and furnished with as many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
as Creatures? for whose use were
the Lights of Heaven, and the innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Forms of lower Beings, Plants,
and Beasts on the Earth? If we regard
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99572:7"/>
their Operations, 'tis evident they were
intended for the benefit of Man. He
that understands himself, and will not
forfeit the Prerogative of the reasonable
Nature, must readily acknowledg that
the Preservation and Comfort of Man,
was their final Rule in the mind of the
Creator, and their mutual usefulness to
one another is referred to his advantage.
He is the Center of the Universe,
wherein the several Orders of visible
Beings, as Lines drawn in a Circle, unite.
And is Man alone left without an end
worthy his excellent Nature? 'Tis not
to be conceived without vile Thoughts,
even the casting an imputation on the
Wisdom of his Maker.</p>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Frame of Man's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
and his Capacity is an indication of
the End for which he was created. For
of things made with design, the End is
present in the Mind of the Agent, that
directs and regulates all the parts of the
Work as the prime reason of it. In a
Ship, the Matter, the Form, the Tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
the number and diversity of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,
are all in order to Sail. Now
Man consists of two parts, an Earthly,
and Spiritual: and to make a right Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his last and happy End, we
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99572:8"/>
must consider him with respect to the
Soul that is capable of nobler Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and higher enjoyments than the
Body is; for the true notion of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
consists in the perfection and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of his principal and most recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Faculties, the Understanding, Will
and Affections, and consequently both
in Action and Fruition with respect to
the most excellent Objects. Hence it
necessarily follows that he is made for a
more worthy purpose than the pursuit
and enjoyment of sensible things, that
please the inferior Part, and only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
the natural Appetites. To make
this evident 'tis requisite to discover the
defects and undervalues of all Worldly
Things, how miserably they fail in the
essential conditions of Felicity that is
proper to Man, and this will convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
prove that the divine Maker, who
is infinitely Wise and Good, endowed
him with intellectual and immortal
Powers, to advance and enjoy his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
wherein the intire Blessedness of the
reasonable Creature consists.</p>
            <p>1. Worldly Things are not perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
of his highest Faculties. Man is
but one <hi>degree lower than the Angels,</hi> and
carries the Image of God indelibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99572:8"/>
in his Spiritual Immortal Soul;
And accordingly the order of things in
the visible World is establish'd. <hi>Thou
hast set him over the Works of thy Hands,
and put all things under his Feet.</hi> By
Nobility of Nature, and the condition
of his state, he is incomparably above
them. And can inferior things make
him better? can Gold be more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
by incorporating with a baser Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal?
or Light more resplendent by mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Clouds and Smoak? All the
<hi>Bona adventitia,</hi> the good things of
this World, Honours, Riches, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
cannot denominate him truly Wise
and Holy, cannot add the least intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
or moral Good, wherein the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
and brightest excellence of Man
is truely plac'd.</p>
            <p>Nay they are consistent with all those
sordid Lusts, that blemish and defame
the humane Nature, and sink it below
it self. External Honour is no Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of real Desert, and considered ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely,
confers no more to Vertue than
to Vice. As Varnish in Painting serves
only to give Lustre and Vavacity to the
Colours, whether the Design be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
or ill, the Picture deformed or beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
and makes the Beauty or Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99572:9"/>
more visible. Splendor of Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
renders the good or bad qualities
of a Person more conspicuous. Folly
set in high Degree is more observed
than in a low Condition. And usually
Titles of Honour are an occasion of
absurd Pride to ignorant Souls, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
not, that Vertue incomparably
excells Nobility, as the Light is more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and radiant where it springs, than
where 'tis reflected. Riches are often
joined with habitual Vices in the Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
and indifferently serve for bad or
good uses. The greedy pursuit of them
blasts all true worth of Spirit, and
turns the Soul to Earth and Corruption.
And sensual Pleasures are so far from
advancing Man, that the luxurious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of them, by the lowest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradement
makes him like the Beasts, in
all things but Innocence. In short, all
the admired things of the World are of
so little value, that they debase and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slave
him by an overprising and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
them. 'Tis his true perfection
from consciousness of his native
worth, and through Royality of Mind,
to despise them.</p>
            <p>2. The sensible World cannot give
compleat satisfaction to Man. Felicity
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99572:9"/>
is the complacence and test of the Soul
in the enjoyment of a suitable Object,
commensurate to its real capacity and
duration. Such an Object must be a
Spiritual Good,<note n="*" place="margin">Beatitudo est bonorum omnium com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexio, secretis omnibus malis. <hi>Cicer.</hi>
               </note> pure without Alloys,
infinite and eternal. Now all things
in the World are in every respect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient
to satisfy our Desires.</p>
            <p>1. They are not a convenient Good
to the Soul. What proportion is there
between a spiritual Nature and carnal
Sensualities, between the divine Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring,
and the low voluptuousness of
Flesh? What are Treasures of Gold
and Pearls, but shining Dust and the
froth of the Sea, and can these enrich
a Heavenly Being? What is Honour
and Reputation? an invisible imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
form'd in a few Heads: What is
Praise, a favourable sound from a few
Mouths? And can a Fancy, a Breath
be the solid Good of the Soul? As well
may an empty Dream afford substantial
Nourishment to the Body.</p>
            <p>Hence the Expectation is far above
the Fruition of earthly Things. Whilst
seen by the false Beams of Fancy and the
Passions, they promise fair, but upon
trial are found to be a meer Illusion,
that has nothing real but the bitterness
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99572:10"/>
that attends them. And from hence
there is a perpetual generation of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
in the Breasts of Men, the<note n="†" place="margin">Quicquid il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis congesseris, non finis erit cupiditatum sed gradus. <hi>Sen.</hi>
               </note> end
of one is the beginning of another, as
Fewel increases the Fire. The wanting
Soul becomes more ardent by failing in
what it expected, and makes endless
inquiries for matter of satisfaction.
<hi>Seneca</hi> observed an image of this in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and gives the Moral of it.<note n="‖" place="margin">Nullum tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum sentit resupinata te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>studo, inquieta est tamen desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derio naturalis status, nec aut ea desinit niti, &amp; quatere se quam in pedes constitit. Ergo omnibus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutionis suae sensus est.</note> A
Tortoise if turn'd on the Back, though
it suffer no pain, is violent in Motion
till it recovers its natural Posture. Thus
Man, though free from external Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
yet is in restless changes, always
casting about till he obtains the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for which he was made, that is ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate
to his Capacity. <hi>Who will shew
us any Good?</hi> is the voice of Mankind
chasing several Hopes, and ingaged in
infinite errors in the search of Felicity
here below. But the confluence of all
worldly things cannot quiet the ravings
of their misguided Appetites. The
<hi>Persian</hi> Kings with all their Royalties,
and Revenues and Delights,<note place="margin">Athen.</note> were so
unsatisfied, that they proclaimed a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to any that invented a new Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
The sweetest Enjoyments are not
without secret distastes. The most
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99572:10"/>
pleasurable Heights are infinitely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from Felicity. Therefore the
most prosperous in the World are fain
to borrow the Opinions of others, who
blindly admire what they never had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of, to conceit themselves Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.
For their real inward Sence is
perfectly contrary to the vain Fancies
of those below them.</p>
            <p>Nay, suppose a Man possest of all the
Varieties that compound earthly Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the more full the less satisfied he is:
for his desires being unquencht, when all
things are ready that promised to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease
them, and no lure of Hope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining,
the disappointment in a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
Object, and despair of ever
finding satisfaction here, necessarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves
him in a double Misery. Of
this we have the certain Testimony of
<hi>Solomon</hi> himself, who after a curious
and earnest search for Happiness, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
that all, even the most valued
things below, <hi>are Vanity,</hi> pompous
Names without sence and reality, and
therefore vexation of Spirit.<note place="margin">Media de fonte teporum sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git amari ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid, quod in ipsis floribus angat. <hi>Lucret.</hi>
               </note> Now
what a poor Happiness is the World
when the fullest possession of it is so far
from inriching a Man with true content,
that it makes his Poverty desperate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:99572:11"/>
2. The Things of the World are
temporal, not commensurate to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Soul. Blessedness signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
an unchangeable State, not a transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Passage: The Object must be firm
as the Center, and the Fruition of it
without end or interruption. The
fear that arises from the naked possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of losing it, dashes our Joy, how
much more the certainty. Now sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the whole World were the Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Man, can he joyfully acquiesce
in it? The fear, nay certainty of part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with all these things, are inseparable
Properties of our possessing them.
Fear, upon the account of their transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
condition, certainty, from Death
that is inevitable to all Men.</p>
            <p>1. Fear of losing them. Such is the
instability of worldly Things through
vicissitudes of Times, disasters of Chance,
decays of Nature, that we cannot be
secure of them a day.<note n="*" place="margin">Nec unquam placidam scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra quietem, certumve sui tenuere Diem. <hi>S. n.</hi>
               </note> Honour is a
casual Happiness, depending on the
uncertain Opinions of Men that rise
and fall every Hour. <hi>Riches are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful,</hi>
not only because they do not
supply our greatest Wants, but fly from
us when we think our hold is fastest.
They are a Quick-Silver no Art can
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99572:11"/>
fix.<note n="†" place="margin">Forma bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num fragile est, quantum<expan>

               </note> Beauty is a fading Flower often
blasted, while the stalk remains. <hi>All
things under the Sun are Vanity.</hi> What
ever is measur'd by Time, is in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Flux like a Torrent, one part is
present to the Eye, because another is
swiftly past away. So that 'tis evident
they are insufficient to make a Man hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.
For who can possess them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a just jealousy lest they should slip
away, or by violence be ravisht from
him. As the Inhabitants of <hi>Campania,</hi>
the most fruitful and delicious part of
<hi>Italy,</hi> but near <hi>Vesuvius</hi> that always
flames, or smoaks and scatters Ashes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
are in frequent apprehensions
lest a sudden deluge of Fire should
break forth and devour their Palaces
and Gardens, and Vineyards, and
change that natural Paradise into a
Scene of Horrour, an accidental
Hell. Now the very suspicion of losing
what is our Happiness is perfectly irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable
to it.</p>
            <p>2. There is a certainty of losing all
earthly things at Death. Other Evils
may surprise us unexpected, or not
come when fear'd. And this relieves
Mankind in the present state that is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to innumerable Evils, that many
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99572:12"/>
may be prevented. But the last evil is
inevitable. Though Men are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisht
in the condition of Living, yet
all are equal in the necessity of Dying.
Human Greatness in every kind, Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Riches, Empires cannot protect from
the sovereign and suddain hand of Death
that overthrows all. The expressions
of Scripture concerning the frailty of
Man are often precisely and literally
verified; <hi>He is like Grass, in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it flourisheth and groweth up, in the
Evening it is cut down and withereth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now suppose the World constant
and faithful to you till the last hour of
your Lives, will it not fail you then?
And can that be the Happiness of a Man
that attends him for a time and leaves
him for ever? The most conspicuous
difference of Men in this World is that
of the Victorious over the Vanquisht
prostrate at his Feet. But Death makes
them equal. Then the wretched Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
shall upbraid the proud Conqueror,
<hi>Art thou become weak as we? art thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
like us?</hi> 'Tis no wonder then that
the wise Preacher despises all the States
of the present Life as Vanity. For the
Fabric cannot be more solid than the
Foundation, nor the Accident more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99572:12"/>
than the Being on which it depends.
On every side Death is in our view, and
the Shadow of it approaching darkens
our brightest Days. 'Tis no wonder
then that he <hi>equals the Fool with the
Wise.</hi> For all that Wisdom that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
to mortal things dies with them.
Nay he confounds Man with the Beast.
<hi>One thing befals them: as the one dieth so
dieth the other, yea they have all one
Breath, so that Man has no preeminence
above them.</hi> While we regard him only
with the Eye of Sence, what shall we
see in his Life, but Folly mixt with Anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties
and Cares? and what in his Death,
but wasted Spirits, the Springs of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
disordered, and at last the living
Frame dissolved into the Earth from
whence it came?</p>
            <p>But if we consider the Soul, that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in it the clear marks of its Original
from God; by the same reason that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing shall be reunited to its Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
<hi>that shall return to God that gave it,</hi>
and remain for ever. The Felicity
therefore to which it naturally aspires,
must be parallel to its duration.
From these Considerations 'tis above
all doubt that Man was designed by
his Maker for a higher End than
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99572:13"/>
the enjoyment of the present World.</p>
            <p>2. The consummate Happiness of
Man is in his Communion with God.
For God is a Spiritual Good suitable to
the Nature of his better and divine part,
and communicates Himself to the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Faculties, the Understanding and
Will, the principles of Man's eminent
Operations, and most capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
Felicity: God is an infinite
Good, and can so fully appease all the
rational Appetites, that nothing is
wanting to his entire Blessedness. God
is an unchangeable Good, not to be
lost with this Life, but may be securely
enjoyed to Eternity. In the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
and Love, in the Imitation and
Enjoyment of his Excellencies, the
highest elevation, and compleat satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of the rational Nature consists.
As Man by applying himself to unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
things is degraded into a lower
Order, and his Thoughts and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that are Spiritual in respect of their
Principles, are Sensual and Perishing
in respect of their Object: so when the
noble Faculties are exercised in a perfect
manner on their Soveraign Good, he
is advanc't to an equality of Perfection
and Joy with the Angels.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:99572:13"/>
The more refined<note n="‖" place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Plat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Symp. &amp; Phoed.</note> Heathens had a
glimpse of this Happiness, some streaks
of it run through their Philosophy.
But till God was pleased to reveal it,
the World sat in Darkness, and slept
securely in the shadow of Death, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned
for an invisible future Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.
'Tis necessary therefore to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into his Word what that blessed
State is wherein the final Happiness of
Man consists.</p>

            <p>'TIs the peculiar honour of the
Gospel that by it Life and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
are brought to
Light. 'Twas not wholly
concealed from Men that only saw the
Creator in his visible Works. 'Twas
more fully discovered by the Law; but
with incomparable more Clearness by
the Gospel. The Nature of it is now
revealed: 'Tis a pure and holy Felicity
in everlasting Communion with the
blessed God. The subject of it is the
intire Man; for this End the Body shall
be awakened out of its dead sleep and
quickned to an Immortal Life. The
place is the highest Heavens, fram'd by
the Divine Hand for the seat of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
the Kingdom of his Love, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the glorious Communications of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
are to his Favourites. The causes
of it are the infinite Mercy of God, and
the meritorious Obedience of his Son
in Man's Nature. The Means whereby
'tis obtained are a lively purifying
Faith that unites us to Christ, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles
us to an Inheritance purchased by
his most precious Blood. And to confirm
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99572:14"/>
our Hopes of this Supernatural Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Our Saviour exhibited a perfect ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of this in himself, rising from the
Grave, crown'd with Immortality, and in
the presence of his Apostles ascending to
Heaven, where he sits at the right Hand
of God; the Head of the Church, from
whom Glory will descend to his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
            <p>To make this supernatural Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
more easy and intelligible to us,
the Scripture describes it by sensible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations.
For while the Soul is
cloath'd with Flesh, Fancy has such a
Dominion, that we can conceive of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but by Comparisons and Images
taken from material Things. 'Tis
therefore set forth by a <hi>Feast,</hi> and a
<hi>Kingdom,</hi> to signify the Joy and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of that State. But to prevent all
gross conceits; it tells us that the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the Saints shall be spiritual, not
capable of hunger and thirst, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
of any refreshment that is
caused by the satisfaction of those Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites.
The Objects of the most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Senses, Seeing and Hearing, the
pleasure of which is mix'd with Reason,
and not common to the Brutes, are
more frequently made use of to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99572:15"/>
that glorious State to the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Minds. Thus sometimes the
Blessed are represented plac'd <hi>on Thrones
with Crowns on their Heads;</hi> sometimes
<hi>cloathed in White, with Palms in their
Hands;</hi> sometimes singing Songs of
triumph <hi>to Him that sits on the Throne,</hi>
and to their Saviour. But the reality
of this Blessedness infinitely exceeds all
those faint Metaphors. Heaven is les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sened
by Comparisons from earthly
things. The Apostle who was dignifi'd
with the revelation of the Successes that
shall happen to the Church till Time
shall be no more, tells us, <hi>It does not
appear what we shall be in Eternity. The
things that God has prepar'd for those that
love him,</hi> are far more above the highest
ascent of our Thoughts, than the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-Feast
of a great Prince exceeds in
splendor and magnificence the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of one that has always liv'd in an
obscure Village, and never saw any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of State, nor tasted Wine in
his Life. We can think of those things
but according to the poverty of our
Understandings. But so much we know
that is able to sweeten all the bitterness,
and render insipid all the sweetness of
this World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:99572:15"/>
This will appear by considering that
whatever is requisite to constitute the
perfect Blessedness of Man, is fully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd
in the Divine Presence.</p>
            <p>1. An exemption from all evils, is
the first condition of perfect Blessedness.
The sentence of wise <hi>Solon</hi> is true in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
sense than he intended,
<q>
                  <l>—Dicíque beatus</l>
                  <l>Ante obitum nemo supremaque funera

               </q>
No Man can be named happy whilst in
this valley of Tears. But upon the
entrance into Heaven, all those evils
that by their number, variety, or
weight disquiet and oppress us, are at
an end,</p>
            <p>Sin, of all Evils the most hateful, shall
be abolisht; and all Temptations that
surround us, and endanger our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
shall cease. Here the best Men
lament the weakness of the flesh, and
sometimes the violent assaults of spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Enemies. St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself breaks
forth into a mournful Complaint, <hi>O
wretched Man that I am! who shall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
me from this body of Death?</hi> And
when harrass'd with the buffets of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99572:16"/>
renews his most earnest addresses to
God to be freed from them. Here our
Purity is not absolute, we must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
cleansing our selves from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
of that deep defilement that
cleaves to our nature. Here our
peace is preserv'd with the Sword in
our hand, by a continual Warfare
against Satan and the World. But
in Heaven no ignorance darkens
the Mind, no passions rebel against the
sanctified Will, no inherent pollution
remains. The Church is <hi>without spot or
wrinkle, or any such thing.</hi> And all
Temptations <hi>that war against the Soul,</hi>
shall then cease. The Tempter was cast
out of Heaven, and none of his poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd
Arrows can reach that Purified
Company. <hi>Glorious Liberty!</hi> here ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
desir'd, but fully enjoyed by the
Sons of God above.</p>
            <p>And as Sin, so all the penal consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of it are quite taken away. The
present Life is an incurable disease, and
sometimes attended with that sharp
sense, that Death is desir'd as a remedy,
and accepted as a benefit. And though
the Saints have reviving Cordials, yet
their joys are mixt with sorrows, nay,
caused by sorrows. The tears of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99572:16"/>
are their sweetest refreshment.
Here the <hi>living Stones</hi> are cut and

was not heard, for all the parts were
fram'd before with that exact design
and correspondence, that they firmly
combin'd together. They were hew'n
in another place, and nothing remain'd
but the putting them one upon another
in the Temple; and then, as sacred,
they were inviolable. So God, <hi>the
wise Architect,</hi> having prepar'd the
Saints here by many cutting Afflictions,
places them in the <hi>Eternal Building,</hi>
where no voice of Sorrow is heard. Of
the innumerable Company above, is
there any Eye that weeps, any Breast
that sighs, any Tongue that complains,
or appearance of Grief? The Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
State is called <hi>Life,</hi> as only worthy
of that Title. There is no infirmity of
Body, no Poverty, no Disgrace, no
Treachery of Friends, no Persecution
of Enemies. <hi>There is no more Death, nor
Sorrow, nor Crying,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 21. 4.</note> 
               <hi>nor shall there be any
more Pain: for former things are past a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi>
God <hi>will wipe away all Tears from
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99572:17"/>
the Eyes of his People.</hi> Their Salvation
is compleat in all degrees. Pure Joy
is the Priviledg of Heaven, unmixed
Sorrows the punishment of Hell.</p>
            <p>A concurrence of all positive Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
is requisite to Blessedness. And
these are to be considered with respect
to the entire Man.</p>
            <p>1. The Body shall be awak'd out of
its dead sleep, and quickned into a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
immortal Life. The Soul and
Body are the essential parts of Man;
and though the inequality be great in
their operations that respect Holiness,
yet their concourse is necessary. Good
Actions are design'd by the Counsel and
Resolution of the Spirit, but perform'd
by the Ministry of the Flesh. Every
Grace expresses it self in visible actions
by the Body. In the sorrows of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
it supplies tears, in Fastings its
appetites are restrain'd, in Thanksgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
the Tongue breaks forth into the
joyful praises of God. All the victories
over sensible pleasure and pain are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
by the Soul in conjunction with
the Body. Now 'tis most becoming
the Divine Goodness not to deal so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently,
that the Soul should be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly
happy, and the Body lost in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99572:17"/>
forgetfulness; the one glorified in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
the other remain in the dust.
From their first setting out in the World
to the Grave they ran the same Race,
and shall enjoy the same Reward. Here
the Body is the Consort of the Soul in
obedience and sufferings, hereafter in
fruition. When the Crown of Purity,
or Palm of Martyrdom shall be given
by the great Judg in the view of all,
they shall both partake in the honour.
Of this we have an earnest in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of Christ in his true Body,
who <hi>is the first fruits of them that sleep.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note>
               <hi>He shall change our vile Bodies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 1.</note> 
               <hi>that they
may be fashioned like to his glorious Body,
according to the working of his Power,
whereby he is able to subdue all things to
himself.</hi> A substantial unfading Glory
will shine in them infinitely above the
perishing Pride of this World, that is
but in appearance, like the false colours
painted on the feathers of a Dove by
reflection of the Light, which presently
vanish, when it changeth its posture, or
the Light is withdrawn. Indeed what
can be more glorious than to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
to the Humanity of Christ, the
seat of all Beauty and Perfection. This
Conformity shall be the work of his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99572:18"/>
own hands. And when Omnipotence
interposes, nothing is difficult. The
raising the Body to an unchangeable
state of Glory, is as easy to the Divine
Power, as the forming it at first in the
Womb. As the Sun labours no more
in the Mines in the forming Gold and
Silver, the most precious and durable
Metals, than in the production of a
poor short-liv'd Flower.</p>
            <p>II. The Soul shall have perfection and
satisfaction in all its Faculties.</p>
            <p>1. The Understanding shall clearly
see the most excellent Objects.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Now
we know but in part.</hi> The naked beauty
of Divine Things is vail'd, and of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
discovery. And the weakness
of the mind is not proportionable to
their dazling brightness. But when
that which is perfect is come, <hi>then that
which is in part shall be done away.</hi> In
that enlightned state, the glorious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation
of the objects shall as much
exceed the clearest revealing of them
here, as the Sun in its full lustre, one
beam of Light strain'd through a crevice
in the Wall. And the Understanding
shall be prepar'd to take a full view of
them. Therefore the Apostle compares
the several Periods of the Church in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99572:18"/>
of the degrees of Knowledg, to
the several Ages of this Life. <hi>When I
was a Child, I spake as a Child, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
as a Child, I thought as a Child:
but when I became a Man, I put away
childish things.</hi> In Children the organs,
either from an excess of moisture, or
their smalness, are indisposed for the
vigorous exercise of the Mind: some
strictures of Reason appear, a presaging
sign what will be, but mixt with much
obscurity. But when the organs are
come to their just proportion and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament,
the Soul displays its strength
and activity.</p>
            <p>All things of a supernatural order
shall then be clearly discovered. The
contrivance of our Salvation, the
ways of conducting us to Blessedness,
which are objects of a sublime nature,
will afford an exquisite pleasure to the
Understanding. All the secrets of our
Redemption shall be unsealed. <hi>The
great Mystery of Godliness,</hi> the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Eternal Son, and his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
Justice with Mercy, shall
then be apparent. The Divine Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
in governing the World, are now
only visible in their wonderful effects
either of Mercy or of Justice, and those
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99572:19"/>
most dreadful; but the Reasons of them
are past finding out. But what our
Saviour said to <hi>Peter, What I do, thou
knowest not now, but shalt know hereafter,</hi>
is applicable to these impenetrable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations.
All the original Fountains
of Wisdom, as clear as deep, shall then
be opened. We shall then see the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Providence in disposing temporal
things in order to our eternal felicity.
We now see as it were the rough part,
and Knots of that curious Embroidery:
but then the whole Work shall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded,
the sweetness of the Colours,
and proportion of the Figures appear.
There we shall be able to expound the
perplexing Riddle, <hi>How out of the Eater
came meat, and out of the Strong came
sweetness. For we shall know as we are
known.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We shall see God.</hi> Our Saviour tells
us, <hi>This is Life Eternal to know thee, the
only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou
hast sent.</hi> The beginning and perfection
of our Happiness consists in this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.
The Deity is spiritual and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to the Eye of the Body, infinite
and incomprehensible to the Soul. But
we shall then so clearly understand the
<hi>Divine Perfections,</hi> that our present
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99572:19"/>
knowledg compar'd to that, is but as
the seeing a dark resemblance in a Glass,
to the clear view of a Person in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
beauty of his Face. God is most
gloriously present in Heaven. For ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the degrees of excellence in
the Work, such are the impressions and
discoveries of the Virtues of the Cause.
Now all sensible things in the low order
of Nature, are but weak resultances
from his Perfections, in comparison of
their illustrious Effects in the Divine
World. The Glories of the Place, and
of the Inhabitants, the Angels and
Saints, clearly express his Majesty,
Goodness and Power. But in a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent
manner he exhibits himself in
the glorified Mediator. He is stiled
<hi>the brightness of the Father's Glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
the express image of his Person;</hi> not only
for his equal Perfections in respect of
the unity of their Nature, but to signify
that God in the Person of the incarnate
Mediator is so fully represented to us,
that by the sight of him we see God
himself in his unchangeable Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.
This appears by the following
words, that <hi>having purged us from our
sins, he sate down on the right-hand of the
Majesty on high;</hi> for they respect the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99572:20"/>
Son of God as united to the humane
Nature, in which he perform'd the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the Priesthood, and took pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of his glorious Kingdom. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his humble state, the Divine Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
Wisdom, Goodness, Holiness,
Power, were so visible in his Person,
Life, Revelations, and miraculous
Works, that when <hi>Philip</hi> so long'd for
the sight of the Father as the only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate
Blessedness, <hi>Shew us the Father,
and it suffices;</hi> He told him, <hi>He that has
seen me, has seen the Father also.</hi> But
how brightly do they appear in his
triumphant Exaltation. 'Twas his
Prayer on Earth; <hi>Father, I will that
they also whom thou hast given me, be with
me where I am, that they may behold my
Glory.</hi> Inestimable Felicity! whether
we consider him in the respect of an
Object, that incomparably transcends
all the created Glory of Heaven, or in
the relation of our Head, on a double
account; partly that because he was deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
into the form of a Servant, and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all Indignities and Cruelties of Sinners
for us, has received the Recompence of
his Meritorious Sufferings, the triumph
of his Victory, <hi>being glorified with the
Father with the Glory he had before the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99572:20"/>
World was;</hi> and partly because every
Member shall be conformed to him in
his Glory; <hi>we shall be like him, for we
shall see him as he is.</hi> And all Felicity
and Glory is compriz'd in that Promise.
The sight of the Face of <hi>Moses</hi> when
radiant, had no transforming efficacy;
for the light of it was not in him as its
source, but by derivation. But God is
Light <hi>essentially,</hi> and the sight of his
Perfections will be productive of his
<hi>Likeness</hi> in us, so far as it may be in a
restrained subject. When our Saviour
was upon the <hi>holy Mount,</hi> and one va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
Beam of Glory appear'd in his
<hi>Transfiguration, Peter</hi> was so transported
at the sight, that he forgot the World
and himself. How ravishing then will
the sight of him be in his triumphant
Majesty, when we shall be transfigured
our selves?</p>
            <p>2. As they shall behold God's Face,
know his most amiable Excellencies;
so they shall love him as perfectly as
they know him. To the illustrations of
the Mind, there are correspondent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
on the Heart. In the present
state our Love is imperfect, and as Fire
out of its sphere, dies away, by our
neglect to feed it with proper materials,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99572:21"/>
enamouring considerations of God.
But 'tis not so in Heaven: there the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Sun attracts every Eye with the
light of its beauty, and inflames every
Heart with the heat of his Love. The
continual Presence of God is in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
respects the Cause and Effect of our
Love to him. For there is no more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Attractive to love him, than to see
him; And Love keeps the thoughts
undivided from him. <hi>God is Love,</hi>
and will kindle in us a pure Affection
that Eternity shall never lessen.</p>
            <p>Our Affections that are now scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
on many things, wherein some small
Reflections of his Goodness appear,
shall join in one full Current in Heaven,
where <hi>God is all in all.</hi> We shall then
understand the riches of his Love, that
God who is infinitely happy in himself,
should make Man for such a Glory, and
such a Glory for Man. And that when
for his Rebellion he was justly expell'd
from Paradise, and under a sentence of
Eternal Death, God should please to
restore him to his Favour, and give
him a better state than was forfeited.
We shall then understand our infinite
Obligations to the Son of God, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
from the Heaven of Heavens to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99572:21"/>
our Earth; and which is more, from
the Majesty wherein he there raign'd,
from the Glory wherein he was visible
to the Angelical Minds, and became
Man for Men, Redemption for the Lost,
to purchase Immortal Life for those who
were dead to that blessed Life. In
short, then God will express his Love
to us in the highest degrees that a finite
Creature is capable to receive from
Love it self, and we shall love him
with all the strength of our glorified
powers.</p>
            <p>3. Compleat satisfaction flows from
union with God by Knowledg and
Love. <hi>In his Presence is fulness of Joy,
at his Right-hand are Pleasures for ever.</hi>
The Causes and Excellencies of the
Heavenly Life are in those words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest.
The Causes are the influxive
Presence of God, the revelation of his
attractive Perfections, the beholding
his Face, the declaration of his peculiar
Favour. This our blessed Lord himself
had a respect to, as the compleat Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of his Sufferings: <hi>Thou shalt make
me full of Joy with thy Countenance.</hi> And
his <hi>Right-Hand,</hi> his Bounty that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penses,
and Power that secures that Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity.
The Excellencies of this state
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99572:22"/>
are fulness of Joy, and that without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution,
or end.</p>
            <p>When the Soul opens its eyes to the
clear discoveries of the first Truth, and
its breast to the dear and intimate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
of the Supream Good, beyond
which nothing remains to be known,
nothing to be enjoy'd, what a deluge
of the purest Pleasures will overflow
it? We cannot ascend in our thoughts
so high, as to conceive the excess of
Joy that attends those operations of the
glorified Soul upon its proper object.
But something we may conjecture.</p>
            <p>Those who are possest with a noble
Passion for Knowledg, how do they
despise all lower Pleasures in comparison
of it? How do they forget themselves,
neglect the Body, and retire into the
Mind, the highest part of Man, and
nearest to God? The bare apprehension
of such things that by their internal
nature have no attractive influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Affections, is pleasant to the
Understanding. As the appearance of
Light, though not attended with any
other visible beauties, refreshes the
Eye after long darkness: so the clear
discovery of Truths, how abstract so
ever, that were before unknown, is
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99572:22"/>
grateful to the intellective Faculty.
Thus some have been strangely trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with the pleasure of a Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Demonstration, when the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
not the importance of the thing
was so ravishing; for what is more dry
and barren of delight than the specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Figures and Numbers? <hi>Solon</hi>
when near his end, and some of his
Friends that visited him were speaking
softly of a Point of Philosophy, by that
sound of Wisdom was awaken'd from
the sleep of Death that was just seizing
on him, and opening his eyes, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his head to give attention; being
ask'd the reason of it? answered, <hi>That
when</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Vt cum istud quicquid est de quo dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putatis perce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pero, mortar. <hi>Val. Max.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>I understand what you are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing
of, I may die.</hi> Such was his
delight in Knowledg, that a little of it
made his Agony insensible. But here
are many Imperfections that lessen this
intellectual Pleasure, which shall cease
in Heaven. Here the acquisition of
Knowledg is often with the expence of
Health: the flower of the Spirits, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for Natural Operations, is wasted
by intense thoughts. How often are
the Learned sickly? As the Flint when
'tis struck, gives not a spark without
consuming it self; So Knowledg is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99572:23"/>
by Studies that wast our faint
sensitive faculties. But then our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
shall be a free emanation from the
spring of Truth, without our labour
and pains. Here we learn by circuit,
and discern by comparing things; our
Ignorance is dispell'd by a gradual suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of Light: But then Universal
Knowledg shall be infused in a moment.
Here after all our labour and toyl, how
little Knowledg do we gain? Every
Question is a Labyrinth out of which
the nimblest and most searching Minds
cannot extricate themselves. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
specious Errors impose upon our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings?
We look on things by
false Lights, through deceiving Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles:
But then our Knowledg shall be
certain and compleat. There is no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
Tree in the Celestial Paradise,
as no inordinate Affection. But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that all things in the compass of the
World were known, yet still there
would be emptiness and anguish in the
Mind: for the most comprehensive
knowledg of things that are insufficient
to make us happy, cannot afford true
Satisfaction. But then we shall see God
in all his Excellencies, the supream
Object and End, the only Felicity of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99572:23"/>
the Soul. How will the sight of his
Glory personally shining in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
in the first moment quench our
extream thirst, and fill us with joy and
admiration? 'Tis not as the naked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of Treasures, that only makes
rich in <hi>ideas,</hi> but that Divine sight gives
a real Interest in him. The Angels are
so ravish'd with the Beauties and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of his Face, that they never divert
a moment from the contemplation of
it.</p>
            <p>2. The pure Love of the Saints to
God is then fully satisfied. Love con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
as an affection of Friendship is
always attended with two desires; to
be assured of Reciprocal Love, and to
enjoy the Conversation of the Person
beloved, the testimony of his esteem
and good-will. This kind of<note n="‖" place="margin">Aristot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
seems to be inconsistent with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
distance that is between God and
the Creature. But though 'tis dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to the Divine Majesty, 'tis
proportionable to his Goodness. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
our Saviour promises, <hi>He that
loves me, shall be loved of my Father, and
I will love him, and manifest my self unto
him.</hi> And to confirm our belief of this
astonishing Condescention, repeats it,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99572:24"/>
               <hi>If a Man love me, my Father will love
him, and we will come to him, and make
our abode with him.</hi> In the present state,
the signs of God's special Favour are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
to his Friends. Now he bestows
on them the honour of being his Sons,
the Graces and Comforts of his Spirit,
the precious Earnests of his Love, <hi>and
Seal of their Redemption.</hi> But in emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
of degrees, the effects of his Love
are incomparably more glorious in
Heaven. Here the Saints are adopted,
there crown'd. There he opens all the
bright Treasures of his Wisdom, the
Riches of his Goodness, the Beauties of
his Holiness, the Glories of his Power,
and by the intimate application of his
Presence makes his Love most sensible
to them. O the mutual delights be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and glorified Souls! God
looks on them with an engaged Eye, as
his own by many dear titles, and is well
pleased in his own Goodness to them,
and ravish'd with the Reflex of his own
Excellencies shining in them. <hi>As the
Bridegroom rejoyces over the Bride,</hi> ('tis
the language of Divine Love) <hi>so their
God rejoyces over thom.</hi> And what a
blessed Rest do they find in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
fruition of their Beloved? All
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99572:24"/>
their desires quietly expire in his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som.
What triumphs of Joy follow?
Can we frame a fuller Conception of
Happiness than to be perfectly loved by
infinite Goodness, and perfectly to love
him?</p>
            <p>3. The supream Joy of the Saints is
for the Felicity and Glory of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
For as the holy Soul feels no more
powerful motive to love God, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is most worthy of it, as he is
God, a Being of infinite Excellencies,
and therefore to be loved above the
dearest Persons and Things, even it self;
so the highest Joy it partakes of is from
this consideration, that God is infinitely
blessed and glorious. For in this the
supream desire of love is accomplish'd,
that the most beloved Object is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
honour'd and pleased In Heaven
the Love of the Saints to God is in its
highest Perfection, and they see his
Glory in the most perfect manner, which
causes a transcendent Joy to them. And
this is one reason why the Saints though
shining with unequal degrees of Glory,
are equally content. For their most
ardent Love being set on God, that he
is pleased to glorify himself by such va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
communications of his Goodness,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99572:25"/>
is full satisfaction to their desires. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
in those different degrees of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
every one is so content with his
own,<note n="†" place="margin">Sic ita<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

               </note> that there is no possible desire of
being but what he is.</p>
            <p>4. The full joy of Heaven shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
without diminution, or end.
The number of Possessors cannot lessen
it. The Divine Presence is an unwasted
Spring of Pleasure, equally full and
open to all, and abundantly sufficient
to satisfy the immensity of their desires.
Envy reigns in this World, because
earthly things are so imperfect in their
nature, and so peculiar in their posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
that they cannot suffice, nor be
enjoyed by all. But in Heaven none
is touch'd with that low base passion:
for God contains all that is precious and
desireable in the highest degrees of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and all partake of the influence
of his universal Goodness without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepting
one another. In the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
above there is no cause for the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Brother to repine at the Father's
Bounty to the younger, nor for the
younger to supplant the elder, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Birth-right. The Heirs of God
are all rais'd to Sovereign Glory. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one enjoys him as entirely and fully,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99572:25"/>
as if solely his felicity. God is a <hi>Good</hi>
as <hi>indivisible</hi> as <hi>infinite,</hi> and not dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
by the most liberal communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Himself. We may illustrate this
by comparing the Price of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
and the Reward. The
Death of Christ is a universal benefit to
all the Saints, yet 'tis so applied to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Believer for his perfect Redemption,
as if our Saviour in all his Agonies and
Sufferings had no other in his Eye and
Heart; as if all his Prayers, his Tears,
his Blood were offer'd up to his Father
only for that Person. The common
respect of it the Apostle declares in those
admirable words, that signify such an
excess of God's Love to us, <hi>He that
spared not his own Son, but deliver'd him
up for us all, how shall he not with him
also freely give us all things?</hi> But to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agin
that the<note n="*" place="margin">Et totum se dedit universis, et totum singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis. Ac per hoc quicquid passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne sua Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor praestitit, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut totum ei debent uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versi, sic sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guli; nisiquod propè hoc plus singuli quàm universi, quod totum accepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt singuli, quantum uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versi. <hi>Salvian.</hi>
               </note> propriety of every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
is thereby prejudiced, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
false, but extreamly injurious to the
Merit and Dignity, and to the infinite
Love of Christ. Therefore the same
Apostle tells us, <hi>The Life which I now
live in the Flesh, I live by the Faith of the
Son of God; who loved me, and gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for me:</hi> as if he were the sole Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Christ's Love, the End and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99572:26"/>
of his Sufferings. And this appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating
of it to himself, is no prejudice
to the Rights of all others. St. <hi>John</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
himself by that truly glorious
Title, <hi>The Disciple whom Jesus loved.</hi>
Could he speak this of himself without
the injury and indignation of the other
Disciples? Certainly he might. For if
we consider that incomprehensible Love
of Christ, exprest to them all at his last
Supper, after <hi>Judas</hi> was gone forth;
<hi>As the Father hath loved me, so I have
loved you;</hi> we may easily understand,
that every one of them might justly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that he was singularly beloved of
Christ. They were all received in the
Heart, though (with <hi>John</hi>) they did
not all lean on the Breast of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Master. Thus in Heaven God is
the universal Treasure of all the Saints,
and the peculiar Portion of every one,
not engrost by possessing, nor wasted
by enjoying.<note n="†" place="margin">Si audiaet multitudo si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens, non inter se particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim comminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt sonos, tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam cibos: sed omne quod sonat &amp; omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus totum est, &amp; singulis to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum. <hi>August. in Epist. ad Volusan.</hi>
               </note> As by his Essence he
equally fills the whole World, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
part of it; and by his Providence
equally regards all and every partitular
Creature; so in Heaven he dispenses
the Riches of his Love to all, that they
cannot desire more, if every one of
them, were (if I may so express it) the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99572:26"/>
only begotten of <hi>the only begotten him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi>
the sole Heir of all the Merits of
his Son. Every Saint may with the
inflamed Spouse break forth in that Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
of Love; <hi>My Beloved is mine,
and I am his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, the great number of the glorifi'd
Saints, is so far from lessening their Joy,
that it unspeakably encreases it. <hi>The
innumerable Company of Angels, and the
General Assembly of the Church of the
First-born,</hi> next of the happiness of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
God, are a chief part of Heaven.
An unfeigned ardent Affection unites
that pure society. Our Love is now
kindled either from a relation in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or a civil account, or some visible
Excellencies that render a Person wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of our choice and friendship: but
in Heaven the Reasons are greater, and
the degrees of Love incomparably more
fervent. All Carnal Alliances and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
cease in that supernatural state.
The Apostle tells us, <hi>If I have known
Christ after the Flesh, I know him so no
more.</hi> By the Resurrection and Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Christ he was transported into
another World, and had communion
with him as an Heavenly King, without
low regards to the temporal Priviledg
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99572:27"/>
of conversing with him on Earth. The
Spiritual relation is more near and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent
than the strictest band of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
The Saints have all relation to
the same Heavenly Father, and to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ</hi> the Prince of Peace, and Head
of that happy Fraternity. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
motives of Love here are the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Excellencies of a Person. Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Holiness, Goodness, Fidelity are
mighty Attractives, and produce a more
worthy Affection, a more intimate
Confederacy of Souls, than propinquity
in Nature, or any carnal respects. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
is amiable in an old Person, though
wrinkled and deformed: Vice is hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in a young Person though beautiful.
There are clearer Eyes than those of
Flesh, a purer Light than what is
sensible, a diviner Beauty than what is
Corporeal, and a nobler Love than what
is sensual. <hi>David</hi> declares that <hi>all his
delight was in the Excellent.</hi> But there
are allays of this Spiritual Love here.
For,</p>
            <p>1. There are reliques of Frailty in
the best Men on Earth, some Blemishes
that render them less amiable when dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.
Here their Graces are mixt
with Infirmities, and but ascending to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99572:27"/>
Glory. Accordingly our Love to them
must be regular, and serene; not cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Error, mistaking defects for
amiable qualities. But in Heaven, the
Image of God is compleat, by the union
of all the glorious Vertues requisite to
its perfection. Every Saint there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
agrees with the first Exemplar, is
transformed according to the primitive
beauty of Holiness. No <hi>spot or wrinkle
remains, nor any such thing,</hi> that may
cast the least aspect of deformity upon
them.</p>
            <p>2. In the present state the least part
of the Saints Worth is visible. As the
Earth is fruitful in Plants and Flowers,
but its riches are in Mines of precious
Metals, the veins of Marble hidden in
its bosom. True Grace appears in sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Actions, <hi>but its Glory is Within.</hi>

               </note> The sincerity of Aims, the purity of
Affections, the impresses of the Spirit
on the Heart, the interiour beauties of
Holiness, are only seen by God. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
such is the humility of eminent
Saints, that the more they abound in
spiritual treasures, the less they show.
As the Heavenly Bodies when in nearest
conjunction with the <hi>Sun,</hi> and fullest
of light, make the least appearance to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99572:28"/>
our sight. But all their Excellencies
shall then be in view. <hi>The Glory of God
shall be revealed in them.</hi> And how at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive
is the Divine Likeness to an
holy Eye? How will it ravish the Saints
to behold an immortal Loveliness
shining in one another? Their Love is
mutual and reflexive, proportionable
to the cause of it. An equal, constant
Flame is preserv'd by pure Materials.
Every one is perfectly amiable, and
perfectly enamour'd with all. Now
can we frame a fuller conception of
Happiness, than such a State of Love,
wherein whatever is pleasant in Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is in perfection, and whatever is
distastful by Mens folly and weakness is
abolished? The Psalmist breaks out in
a Rapture, <hi>Behold how good and pleasant
it is for Brethren to dwell together in Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty!</hi>
Love is the Beauty and Strength of
Societies, the Pleasure of Life. How
excellent is the Joy of the Blessed, when
the Prayer of Christ shall be accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
that they all may be <hi>one; as thou
Father art in me, and I in thee, that they
also may be one in us.</hi> God is absolutely
One in his glorious Nature and Will,
and therefore unalterably Happy; And
their inviolable Union in Love, is a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99572:28"/>
Ray of the Essential Unity between the
sacred Persons. There are no Divisions
of Heart and Tongues, as in this <hi>Babel;</hi>
but the most perfect and sweetest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
an Eternal Agreement in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
and Inclinations. There are no
envious Comparisons; for Love that
affectively transforms one into another,
causes the Glory of every Saint to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
to the Joy of all. Every one
takes his share in the Felicity of all, and
adds to it. Such is the power of that
Celestial Fire wherein they all burn,
that it melts and mixes Souls in such an
entire Union, that by Complacence
and an intimate Joy, the Blessedness of
all is, as it were, proper to every one;
as if every one were plac'd in the Hearts
of all, and all in the Heart of every one.
If in the Church of the first-born Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
in the earthly <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the Band
of Charity was so strict that 'tis said, the
<hi>Multitude of Believers were of one Heart,
and one Soul;</hi> How much more intimate
and inseparable is the Union of the
Saints in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> above, where every
one loves another as himself? 'Tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that entring with
<hi>Hephestion</hi> his Favourite, into the Pavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
of <hi>Darius</hi> his Mother, then his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99572:29"/>
she bowed to the Favourite, as
having a greater appearance of Majesty,
thinking him to be <hi>Alexander:</hi> but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
of her Error, she humbly begg'd
his Pardon: To whom the generous
King replied,<note place="margin">Non errâti Mater, nam hic <hi>Alexander</hi> est<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Curt. lib.</hi> 3.</note> 
               <hi>You did not err, Mother,
this is also Alexander:</hi> Such was their
Affection, that whoever was taken of
them, the other was taken in him; the
less ascending in the greater, without
degrading the greater in the less. This
is a Copy of the holy Love of the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
but with the same difference, as
between the Description of a Star with
a Coal, and its Beauty in its proper
Aspect. And where all is Love, all is
Delight. O how do they enjoy and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
in the Happiness of one another?
With what an unimaginable Tenderness
do they embrace? What Reciprocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Endearments are between them?
O their ravishing Conversation, and
sweet Entercourse! for their Presence
together in Heaven is not a silent Show.
In the Transfiguration, <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi>
talk't with Christ. With what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
discourses do they entertain one
another? If <hi>David</hi> felt such inward
Pleasure from the sence of God's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
that he could not restrain the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99572:29"/>
expression of it, but invites the Saints,
<hi>Come and hear, all ye that fear the Lord,
and, I will tell you what he has done for my
Soul.</hi> Certainly in Heaven, the blessed
with overflowing affections recount
the Divine Benefits: the admirable Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
whereby the Life of Grace was
begun, preserv'd and carried on in the
midst of Temptations; the continual
Succession of Mercies in the time of
their Hopes, and the Consummation of
all in the time of their Enjoyment. How
joyfully do they concur in their thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings
to God for the goodness of
Creation: in making them reasonable
Creatures, capable to know, love and
enjoy Him, when they might have been
of the lowest Order in the wholesphere
of Beings: for his compassionate care
and providence over them in this
World: But especially for his sovereign
and singular Mercy in electing them to
be vessels of honour: for his powerful
Grace, in rescuing them from the cruel
and ignominious bondage of Sin: for
his most free Love, that justified them
from all their guilt by the Death of his
only Son, and glorified them with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
They are never weary in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
exercise, but continually bless
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:99572:30"/>
him for his <hi>Mercy that endures for ever.</hi>
We may judg by the Saints here, when
they are in a fit disposition to praise
God, what fervours they feel in their
united Praises of him in Heaven. The
<hi>Psalmist</hi> in an Extasie calls to all the
parts of the World to joyn with him;
<hi>The Lord reigns, let the Heavens rejoyce,
and the Earth be glad; let the Sea roar,
let the Fields be joyful, and all that dwell
therein.</hi> He desires that Nature should
be elevated above it self, that the dead
parts be inspir'd with Life, the insensible
feel Motions of Joy, and those that want
a Voice break forth in praises, to adorn
the Divine Triumph. With what Life
and Alacrity will the Saints in their
blessed Communion celebrate the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of their Love and Praises? The
<hi>Seraphims</hi> about the Throne <hi>cryed to one
another,</hi> to express their Zeal and Joy,
in celebrating his Eternal Purity and
Power, and the Glory of his Goodness.
O the unspeakable Pleasure of this
Concert! when every Soul is harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and contributes his part to the full
Musick of Heaven. O could we hear
but some <hi>Eccho</hi> of those Songs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the Heaven of Heavens resounds,
some remains of those Voices wherewith
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99572:30"/>
the Saints above <hi>triumph in the Praises,</hi>
in the solemn Adoration of the King of
Spirits, how would it inflame our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
to be joyn'd with them? <hi>Blessed
are those that are in thy House, they always
praise thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The fulness of Joy in Heaven is
undecaying; for the causes of it are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
equal. And those are the Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
Object reveal'd, and the uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Contemplation of it. Whilst
we are here below, the Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
as to our perception and sence,
has ascensions and declinations, accesses
and recesses. And our Earth is not so
purified, but some Vapors arise that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept
his chearful refreshing Light.
From hence there are alternate succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Spiritual Comforts and Sorrows,
of Doubts and filial Confidence in the
Saints. 'Tis a rare favour of Heaven,
when an humble Believer in his whole
course is so circumspect as not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
God to appear displeased against
him: When a Christian (as those tute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Angels spoken of in the Gospel) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
beholds the face of his Heavenly
Father, and converses with him with
an holy Liberty. And what a torment
the <hi>hiding of God's Face</hi> is to a deserted
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99572:31"/>
Soul, only they know who feel it. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
troubles are many times attended
with more Consolations to the Spirit,
than Afflictions to Sense; but to love
God with a transcendent Affection, and
to fear he is our Enemy, no Punishment
exceeds, or is equal to it. As his Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-kindness
in their esteem is better
than Life, so his Displeasure is worse
than Death. How do they wrestle
with God by Prayers and Tears, and
offer, as it were, a holy Violence to the
King of Heaven, to recover their first
serenity of Mind, the lost Peace of
Heart? How passionately do they cry
out with <hi>Job,</hi> in the Book of his Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<hi>O that I were as in months past,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 29. 2, 3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>as
in the days when God preserved me: when
his Candle shin'd upon my head, and when
by his Light I walk'd through darkness:
As I was in the days of my youth, when
the Secret of God was upon my Tabernacle.</hi>
And sometimes God delays the reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself even to his dearest Children;
not that he does not see their Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and hears their Prayers, or is so
hard that till their Extremities he is not
moved with Compassion, but for wise
and holy Reasons; Either <hi>that they may
not return to folly,</hi> if by any presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:99572:31"/>
Sin they forfeited their Peace; or
if they have been careful to please him,
yet he may deprive them of Spiritual
Comforts for a time, to keep them hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and that with an obedient resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to his Sovereign Pleasure they may
wait for his reviving Presence. And
then Joy returns greater than before.
For thus God usually renders with inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
what he suspended only for trial.
But the Saints above are for ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
with the vital splendor, and
dear regards of his Countenance, always
enjoy his beamy smiles. A continual
effusion of Glory illustrates Heaven and
all its blessed Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>And their Contemplation of God is
fixed. If the Object, though extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
glorious, were transient, or the
Eye so weak that it could only see it
but by glances, the heighth of Joy
would not be perpetual. But the mind
is prepar'd with supernatural vigour,
to see the brightness of God's Face, and
by the most attentive application al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
converses with that blessed Object;
so that the Joy of Heaven is never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted
for a moment. They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
see, and love, and rejoyce, and
praise him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:99572:32"/>
'Tis possible a carnal suspicion may
arise in some, as if the uniform perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
vision of the same Glory might lose
its perfect delightfulness. For those
who seek for happiness in the vanity of
the Creatures, are always desirous of
change, and have their Judgments so
corrupted, that while they languish
with a secret desire after an unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Good, yet they conceive no Good
as desireable, that is not changed.</p>
            <p>But to correct this gross errour of
Fancy, let us a little enquire into the
causes of Dissatisfaction, that make the
constant fruition of the same thing here
to be tedious.</p>
            <p>Sensible things are of such a limited
Goodness, that not any of them can
supply all our present wants, so that 'tis
necessary to leave one for another. And
the most of them are Remedies of our
diseased Appetites, and if not tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
used, are destructive Evils. Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Drinking are to extinguish
Hunger and Thirst, but continued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
just measure, become nauseous.
Besides, the Insufficiency of their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
the Senses themselves cannot be
satisfied all at once. The Ear cannot
attend to delightful Sounds, and the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99572:32"/>
Eye be intent on beautiful Colours at
the same time. The Satisfaction of one
Sense defeats another of enjoying its
proper good; therefore the same Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
is not constantly pleasant, but the
Heart is distemper'd from as many Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
as there are desires unaccomplish'd.
Add farther, all things under the Sun
afford only a superficial delight, and
miserably deceive the Expectations rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of them: and many times there is a
mixture of some evil in them, that is
more offensive, than the good is delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
The Honey is attended with a
Sting, so that often those very things
we sigh after through vehement desire,
when they are obtain'd, we sigh for
grief. Now all these Causes of dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
cease in Heaven; for<note n="*" place="margin">Vitae nos tae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium tenet ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor mortis, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat omne consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium, nec im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plere nos ulla faelicitas potest. Causae autem est, quod non pervenimus ad illud bonum immensum &amp; insuperabile, ubi necesse est, consistat nobis voluntas nos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra, quia ultra summum non est locus. <hi>Senec. epist.</hi> 74.</note> God is
an infinite Good, and whatever is
truly desireable and precious, is in Him
in all degrees of Perfection. And in
his Presence all the Powers of the Soul
are drawn out in their most pleasant
exercise, and always enjoy their entire
happiness. The fruition of him exceeds
our most raised hopes, as much as he is
more glorious in Himself than in any
borrowed Representations. God will
be to us incomparably <hi>above what we can
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:99572:33"/>
ask or think.</hi> The compass of our
thoughts, the depth of our desires are
imperfect measures of his Perfections.
And as he is a <hi>Pure Good</hi> in Himself, so
he is prevalent over all Evil. 'Tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
therefore that nothing can allay
the Joys of Saints when they are in
God's presence.</p>
            <p>2. Novelty is not requisite to ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
every Good, and make it perfectly
delightful.<note n="†" place="margin">

                  </gap> Arist. Eth. l. 7. c. ult.</note> God is infinitely happy, to
whom no Good was ever new. 'Tis
indeed the Sauce that gives a delicious
taste to inferiour things. For Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
only what is eminent; and the good
things of this World are so truly mean,
that they are feign to borrow a shew
of Greatness by comparison with a worse
estate preceding. But an infinite Good
produces always the same pure equal
compleat Joy, because it arises from its
intrinsic perfection, that wants no Foil
to commend it. The Psalmist breaks
forth, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but Thee?</hi>
This is no vanishing Rapture, but a
constant joyful height of Affection. God,
the essential happiness of the Saints, is
always perfectly lovely and delightful
to them.</p>
            <p>3. The glorified Saints in every pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:99572:33"/>
of their happy state, have as lively
a perception of it as in the beginning.
To make this evident, we must consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that the pleasure of Novelty springs
from a quick sense of the opposite terms,
between our condition in the want of
some desired Good, and after our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
it. Now the Mind is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense
on the advantage, and more
strongly affected at first. One newly
freed from the torments of a sharp dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
feels a greater pleasure than from
a constant tenour of health. Those
who are rais'd from a low state to emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Dignity, are transported with
their first change, but in tract of time
the remembrance of their mean condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is so weakned and spent, that 'tis
like the shadow of a Dream, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
their Joy is lessened. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
like Perfumes, by custom are less
sensible to those that carry them. But
the Saints above always consider and
feel the excellent difference between
their suffering and triumphant state.
They never lose that ravishing part of
felicity, the vivid sense of past evils.
Their reflections are always as strong on
the Misery from whence they were
rais'd to the pitch of Happiness, as in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:99572:34"/>
their first glorious Translation. In
what an Extasy of wonder and pleasure
will they be, from the fresh memory of
what they were, and the joyful sense
of what they are? <hi>I was</hi> (says the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
Soul) <hi>poor, blind, and naked;</hi>
but O miraculous and happy Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!
I am full of Light, enrich'd with
the Treasures of Heaven, adorn'd with
Divine Glory. I was under the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
power of Satan, <hi>but he is bruised
under my feet.</hi> I was sentenc'd to an
everlasting separation from the Presence
of God, my only Life and Joy; but
now am possest of my supream Good.
O how transporting is the comparison
of these wide and contrary extreams?
How beautiful and pleasant is the Day
of Eternity, after such a dark tempestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Night? How does the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of such Evils produce a more
lively and feeling fruition of such Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness?
How strangely and mightily
does <hi>Salvation with Eternal Glory affect
the Soul?</hi> This gives a spritely accent
to their everlasting <hi>Hallelujahs.</hi> This
preserves an affectionate Heat in their
Thanksgivings to their Victorious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer.
And thus their Happiness is
always the same, and always new.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:99572:34"/>
Their pleasure is continued in its perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> The Blessedness of the Saints
is without end. This makes Heaven to
be it self. There is no satiety of the
present, no solicitude for the future.
Were there a possibility, or the least
suspicion of losing that happy state, it
would cast an aspersion of bitterness up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all their delights: they could not
enjoy one moments repose; but the
more excellent their Happiness is, the
more stinging would their fear be of
parting with it. <hi>But the Inheritance
reserved in Heaven, is immortal, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed,
and fades not away.</hi> And the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure
of their Possession is infinitely
firm by the Divine Power, the true
Support of their everlasting Durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>With God is the Fountain of
Life.</hi> They enjoy a better Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
than the Tree of Life could have
preserved in <hi>Adam.</hi> The Revolutions
of the Heavens, and Ages, are under
their Feet, and cannot in the least alter
or determin their Happiness. After
the passing of millions of Years, still
an entire Eternity remains of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
God. O most desireable State!
where Blessedness and Eternity are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separably
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:99572:35"/>
united. O joyful Harmony!
when the full <hi>Chorus</hi> of Heaven shall
sing, <hi>This God is our God for ever and
ever.</hi> This adds an infinite weight to
their Glory. This redoubles their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
Joys with infinite sweetness
and security. They repose themselves
in the compleat Fruition of their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.
God reigns in the Saints, and
they live in him for ever.</p>

         <div n="3" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. III.</head>
            <head type="sub">The Mercy of God the Original Cause of
his designing and preparing Heaven for
his People. The Obedience of Christ,
the meritorious Cause. Some Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
are required in those that shall
possess it. The holy Change of Man's
Nature indispensibly requisite in order to
his Reception into Heaven. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of it specified.</head>
            <p>HAving such a Revelation of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in the Gospel, that all the
Kingdoms of the World, and the Glory
of them, in comparison, are but as a
Glow-worm to the Light of the Sun,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:99572:35"/>
with what inflamed desires should we
seek, and strive for that unchangeable
Happiness? In order to this we shall
consider the causes of it, and the means
whereby 'tis obtain'd.</p>
            <p>The Original moving Cause is the
pure rich Mercy of God that prepared
it for his People, and prepares them for
it. The procuring Cause is the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
efficacy of Christ's Obedience and
Sufferings. This is expresly declared
by the Apostle; <hi>The wages of Sin is
Death, but the gift of God is eternal Life
through Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. The designing, the preparation,
and actual bestowing of the Heavenly
Glory is from the Mercy of God. This
will appear by considering,</p>
            <p>1. That it is absolutely impossible
that a meer Creature, though perfect,
should deserve any thing from God.
For enjoying its being and powers of
working from his Goodness, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of all is entirely due to him. And
the payment of a Debt acquires no Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to a Reward. He is the Proprietary
and Lord of all by Creation. Hence
'tis clear that in the order of distributive
Justice nothing can be challenged from
him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:99572:36"/>
2. Besides, such is the infinite Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of God in Himself, that no benefit
can redound to him by the service of
the Creature. <hi>When you have done all,
say you are unprofitable Servants, for we
have done what we ought to do.</hi> The
neglect of our duty justly exposes to
punishment, but the performance of it
deserves no Reward, because no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
accrues to God by it. <hi>Who hath
first given unto him, and it shall be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed
to him again?</hi> He challenges all
Creatures even of the highest order.
To speak strictly therefore, When God
crowns the Angels with Glory, he
gives what is meerly his own, and does
not render what is theirs. If he should
leave them in their pure Nature, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
them of their Being, he were no
loser, nor injurious to them. For what
Law binds him to enrich them with
Immortal Glory, who are no ways pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to him, or to preserve that being
they had from his unexcited Goodness.
No Creature can give to him, therefore
none can receive from him by way of
valuable Consideration.</p>
            <p>3. There is no proportion between
the best works of Men, and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the Reward, much less an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:99572:36"/>
'Twas the just and humble
acknowledgment of <hi>Jacob</hi> to God, <hi>I am
less than the least of all thy Mercies,</hi> those
that common Providence dispenses for
the support and refreshment of this
temporal Life. But how much less than
the glorious Excellencies of the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Divine Life, wherein the Saints
reign with God for ever? The most
costly, the most difficult and hazardous
Services, are equally nothing in point
of Merit, with the giving but a <hi>Cup of
cold Water to a Disciple of Christ,</hi> there
being no correspondence in value be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them and the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
The Apostle tells us, <hi>I count the
Sufferings of the present Life are not to be
compar'd to the Glory that shall be revealed
in us.</hi> And suffering is more than do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
God rewards his faithful Servants
not according to the dignity of their
Works, but his own Liberality and
Magnificence. As <hi>Alexander</hi> having
ordered fifty Talents of Gold to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to a Gentleman in Poverty to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
his want, and he surpris'd with that
immense Bounty, modestly said, ten were
enough; He replied, <hi>If fifty are too
much for you to receive, ten are too little
for me to give; therefore do you receive as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:99572:37"/>
Poor, I will give as a King.</hi> Thus God
in the dispensing his Favours does not
respect the meanness of our Persons or
Services, but gives to us as a God. And
the clearest Notion of the Deity is that
he is a Being infinite in all Perfections,
therefore all-sufficient and most willing
to make his Creatures compleatly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.</p>
            <p>4. If a Creature perfectly Holy that
never sinn'd is uncapable to merit any
thing from God, much less can those
who are born in a sinful State, and
guilty of innumerable actual Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
pretend to deserve any Reward
for their Works. This were presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
inspir'd by prodigious Vanity. For,</p>
            <p>1. By his most free Grace they are
restored in conversion to that Spiritual
Power by which they serve him. The
<hi>Chaos</hi> was not a deader Lump before
the Spirit of God moved on the Face
of the Waters, than the best of Men
were before the vital influences of the
Spirit wrought upon them. And for
this they are so deeply obliged to God,
that if a thousand times more for his
Glory were perform'd, yet they cannot
discharge what they owe.</p>
            <p>2. The continuance and increase of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:99572:37"/>
the powerful supplies of Grace to the
Saints, who even since their holy calling
by many lapses have justly deserved that
God should withdraw his grieved Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
are new Obligations to Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
and the more Grace the less
Merit.</p>
            <p>3. The best Works of Men are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
allayed with the mixtures of
Infirmities, and not of full weight in
the Divine Ballance. If God should
strictly examin our Righteousness, 'twill
be found neither pure nor perfect in his
Eyes, and without Favour and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
would be rejected. And that
which wants Pardon, cannot deserve
Praise and Glory. <hi>He shews Mercy to
thousands that love him, and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi>
If Obedience were meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious,
it were strict justice to reward
them. The Apostle prays for <hi>Onesipho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
who had exposed himself to great
danger for his love to the Gospel, <hi>The
Lord grant he may find Mercy in that day.</hi>
The Divine Mercy gives the Crown of
Life to the Faithful in the day of eternal
Recompenses.</p>
            <p>II. The meritorious Cause of our
obtaining Heaven, is the Obedience of
Jesus Christ comprehending all that he
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:99572:38"/>
did and suffered to reconcile God to us.
From him as the eternal Word we have
all benefits in the order of Nature, <hi>for
all things were made by him;</hi> and for him,
as the incarnate Word, all good things
in the order of Grace. What we enjoy
in Time, and expect in Eternity, is by
him. To shew what influence his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation
has to make us happy, we must
consider;</p>
            <p>1. Man by his Rebellion justly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
his Happiness, and the Law ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts
precisely the forfeiture. Pure Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
requires the Crime should be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht
according to its Quality, much
less will it suffer the guilty to enjoy the
favour of God. For Sin is not to be
considered as an Offence and Injury to
a private Person, but the violation of a
Law, and a disturbance in the order of
Government, so that to preserve the
honour of governing Justice, an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
reparation was necessary. Till
Sin was expiated by a proper Sacrifice,
the Divine Goodness was a sealed
Spring, and its blessed effects restrain'd
from the guilty Creature. Now the
Son of God in our assumed Nature of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
up himself a Sacrifice in our stead,
to satisfy Divine Justice, and removed
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:99572:38"/>
the Bar, that Mercy might be glorified
in our Salvation. The Apostle gives
this account of it;<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>We have boldness to
enter into the Holiest, by the Blood of
Christ, by a new and living way which he
hath consecrated for us, through the Vaile,
that is to say, his Flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Such were the most precious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of his Obedience, that it was not
only sufficient to free the guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminated
race of Mankind from Hell,
but to purchase for them the Kingdom
of Heaven. If we consider his Human
Nature, all Graces were born with him,
as Rays with the Sun, and shin'd in the
whole course of his Life in the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of perfection. And the dignity
of his divine Person derived an immense
value to all he perform'd as Mediator.
One act of his Obedience was more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
to God than all the Lives of
the Saints, the Deaths of the Martyrs,
and the Service of the Angels. God
was more pleased in the Obedience of
his Beloved Son, than he was provok't
by the Rebellion of his Servants. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as the just recompence of it, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
him to be Universal Head of the
Church, supream Judg of the World;
invested him with Divine Glory, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:99572:39"/>
with Power to communicate it to his
faithful Servants. <hi>He is the Prince of
Life.</hi> In short, it is as much upon the
account of Christ's Sufferings that we
are glorified, as that we are forgiven.
The Wounds he received in his Body,
the Characters of Ignominy, and Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps
of Death, are the Fountains of our
Glory. His Abasement is the cause of
our Exaltation.</p>
            <p>If it be said, this seems to lessen the
freeness of this Gift. The answer is
clear;</p>
            <p>This was due to Christ, but unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by us. Besides, the appointing
his Son to be our Mediator in the way
of our ransom, was the most glorious
work of his Goodness.</p>
            <p>2. The means of our obtaining Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
are to be considered. Though the
Divine Goodness be free in its Acts, and
there can be nothing in the Creature of
Merit, or Inducement to prevail upon
God in the nature of a cause, yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
qualifications in all those who
shall enjoy that blessed unchangeable
Kingdom. The Apostle expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
<hi>'Tis not of him that wills,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 16.</note> 
               <hi>nor of
him that runs, but of God that sheweth
Mercy.</hi> But we must distinguish the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:99572:39"/>
Effects of this Mercy, which are dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in that order the Gospel lays down.
The first Mercy is the powerful calling
the Sinner from his corrupt and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
State; a second Mercy is the pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Sins; the last and most eminent is
the glorifying him in Heaven. Now 'tis
clear that in this place, <hi>the shewing of
Mercy,</hi> signifies the preventing Grace
of God in Conversion, for in the 18<hi>th</hi>
verse, 'tis said, God shews Mercy to
<hi>whom he will, and whom he will he har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.</hi>
Where 'tis evident <hi>that shewing
Mercy</hi> is oppos'd not to condemning,
but <hi>to hardning,</hi> and consequently the
intent of the Words is this, That Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Grace overcomes the Rebellious
Will, softens the stiff and stubborn
Heart, and makes it pliant to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
This flows from his pure good
Will and Pleasure, without the least
motive from the inclinations or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of sinful Men. But the other
Effects of God's Mercy require Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the Subjects that receive them:
for he pardons only penitent Believers,
and glorifies none but persevering
Saints.</p>
            <p>To make this clear 'tis worthy of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
The Gospel has several De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:99572:40"/>
'Tis called <hi>a Law, a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and a Testament.</hi> 'Tis called <hi>the
Law of Faith, and the Law of the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Life.</hi> As a Law it signifies a new
Right that God has most freely estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisht
in favour of lost Man, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
certain Duties, and sets before
them Eternal Life as the reward of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
and Eternal Death the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of Disobedience. According
to this the trial and decision of Mens
everlasting States shall be, which is the
Character of a true Law. This Law of
Grace, is very different from the Law
of Nature, that requir'd intire inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
and for the least omission, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing
act, past an irrevokable doom
upon the Offender: for that strictness
and severity is mollified by the Gospel,
which accepts of sincere persevering O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
though imperfect; accordingly
'tis called <hi>the Law of Liberty.</hi>
               <note place="margin">James 2.</note> But <hi>the
Law of Faith</hi> is unalterable, and admits
of no dispensation from the duties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in order to our being everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stingly
happy.</p>
            <p>2. The Gospel is stiled <hi>a Covenant,</hi>
and that imports a reciprocal engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
between parties for the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the matter contained in it.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:99572:40"/>
The Covenant of Grace includes the
promise of pardoning and rewarding
Mercy on God's part, and the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on Man's with respect to which 'tis
to be perform'd. There is an inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
dependence between them. He will
be <hi>our God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 9.</note> to make us happy, <hi>but we
must be his People to yeild unreserved Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor.</note> 
               <hi>He will be our Father,
and we shall be his Sons and Daughters,</hi>
but 'tis upon the terms of <hi>purifying our
selves from all pollutions of Flesh and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
and unfeigned endeavours to <hi>perfect
Holiness in his fear.</hi> 'Tis astonishing
Goodness that he is pleased to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
to such a treaty with fallen Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
by a voluntary promise he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages
them, but though most free in
making, 'tis conditional in the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
The constancy of his holy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
obliges him to fulfil his Word, but
'tis if we do not fail on our part by
carelessness of our Duty A Presumer
may seal assurance to himself, and be
deceived in this great matter, but <hi>God
will not be mocked.</hi> If we prove false in
the Covenant, he will be faithful, and
exclude those from Heaven that were
neglectful of the Conditions to which it
is promised.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:99572:41"/>
3. The Gospel is stiled <hi>a Testament</hi>
sealed in the Blood of Christ, confirm'd
by his Death. The donation of eternal
blessings in it is not absolute and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective,
but the Heirs are admitted to
the Possession of the Inheritance accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Will of the rich liberal and
wise Testator. There can be no regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
title or claim made out without
performing what is required. And this
<hi>is the Will of God and Christ our Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi>
without which we cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
it.</p>
            <p>Now from hence we may see the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
agreement between these two
Notions, that Heaven is a Gift and a
Reward. 'Tis a Reward in the order
of giving it, not due to the Work, but
from the Bounty of the Giver. God
gives Heaven to those that faithfully
serve him. But their Service was due
to God, of no worth in respect of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
so that Man's Work is no Merit,
and God's Reward is a Gift. Our ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Glory must be ascribed to his
most free Grace, as much as the pardon
of our Sins.</p>
            <p>I shall now proceed to consider, what
the Gospel declares to be indispensibly
requisite in order to our obtaining of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:99572:41"/>
Heaven: this is compriz'd in the holy
change of Man's Nature, which I will
briefly unfold, and shew how necessary
it is to qualify us for Celestial Glory.</p>
            <p>1. This holy Change is exprest in
Scripture by the new Birth. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
with a solemn repeated Assevera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
tells <hi>Nicodemus;</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 3. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Verily, Verily, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
a Man be born again, he cannot see
the Kingdom of God.</hi> Sin is natural to
Man from his Conception and Birth,
and infects with its contagion all his
Faculties. This is fomented and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risht
by temptations that easily encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
him. The Understanding is pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with evil Principles, full of strong
Prejudices, and lofty Imaginations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the supernatural Mysteries of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
'Tis full of Ignorance and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and from hence either rejects them
as incredible, or despises them as imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
or unprofitable. The Will is
depraved and perverse, full of unruly
and unhallowed Affections. The Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
are luxurious and rebellious. In
short Man, is so viciously and sensually
inclined, so <hi>alienated from the Life of
God,</hi> as if he had no diviner part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
him, that should aspire to a Spiritual
Blessedness, that should regulate and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:99572:42"/>
controul the excess of the inferiour Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites.
This is the unhappy Character
Satan imprest on him in his Fall, and
without renovation upon an infinite
account he is uncapable of seeing God.
This renovation consists not in the
change of his substance, as the Water
was miraculously turn'd into Wine at
the Marriage in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee:</hi> the
same Soul with its essential Powers, the
same Body with its natural Senses, the
Work of the Creator remains; but in
the cleansing of his stain'd nature, in the
sanctifying his Faculties that are the
Springs of his Actions. The whole Man is
quickned into a Divine Life, and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to act in conformity to it. And
of this the new Birth is a convenient Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustration.
An active Principle of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
is planted in him that springs up
into visible Actions. The Apostle par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
expresses it in his earnest Prayer
for the <hi>Thessalonians, The very God of
Peace sanctify you wholly, and preserve
your whole Spirit, Soul and Body blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
till the coming of Jesus Christ.</hi> Every
Faculty is renewed, and every Grace
infused that constitutes the Divine
Image. The Mind is renewed by Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Light, to believe the Truth and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:99572:42"/>
Goodness of unseen things promised,
the reality and dreadfulness of things
threatned in the Word of God. It
sees the truest Beauty in Holiness, the
highest Honour in Obedience to God,
the greatest Equity and Excellence in
his Service. The Will is renewed by
holy Love, a purifying Flame, and feels
the attractive virtue of our blessed End,
before all desireable things on Earth,
and determins to pursue it in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
use of proper means. The
Body is made a holy instrument fit for
the renewed Soul. In short, the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Man becomes spiritual in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
Resolutions and Actions. <hi>All
things are become New.</hi> There is a firm
assent, an inviolable adherence to those
most precious Objects revealed in the
Scripture, and a sincere chosen constant
Obedience flows from the renewed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.
And from hence we may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
between regenerating Grace,
and formal Hypocrisy in some, and the
proficiency of Nature, and power of
common Grace in others. A Hypocrite
in Religion is acted from without, by
mercenary base respects, and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
being cauteris'd, handles sacred
things without feeling: a regenerate
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99572:43"/>
Person is moved by an internal living
Principle, and performs his Duties with
lively Affections. Natural Conscience
under the compulsion of Fear, may lay
a restraint upon the outward acts of Sin,
without an inward consent to the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity
of the Law. Renewing Grace
cleanses the Fountain, and the current
is pure. It reconciles the Affections to
the most holy Commands. <hi>I love thy
Law because 'tis pure,</hi> saith the Psalmist.</p>
            <p>A moral Principle may induce one
to abstain from many Sins, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
many praise-worthy things in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to Reason. But this is neither
sanctifying nor saving: for it only
prunes Sin as if it were a good Plant,
and does not root it up; it compounds
with it, and does not destroy it. There
may be still an impure indulgence to
the secret lustings of the Heart, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the restraint upon their
Exercise. And many Duties may be
done on lower motives, without a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
respect to the Commands and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God.</p>
            <p>But renewing Grace subjects the Soul
to the whole Royalty of the Law, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly
inclines it to express Obedience
to all its Precepts, because they are
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99572:43"/>
pure, and derived from the eternal
Spring of Purity. It mortifies Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence,
and quickens to every good
Work, from a Principle of Love to God,
and in this is distinguisht from the most
refined unregenerate Morality. In short,
there may be a superficial tincture of
Religion from common Grace, a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient
Esteem, vanishing Affections, and
earnest Endeavours for a time after Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Things, and yet a Person remain
in a state of unregeneracy. But renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Grace is a permanent solid Principle,
that makes a Man <hi>partaker of the Divine
Nature,</hi> and elevates him above himself.</p>
            <p>This holy Change is wrought by
Divine Power. Our Saviour tells
<hi>Nicodemus, Except a Man be born of
Water and the Spirit, he cannot enter
into the Kingdom of God.</hi> The Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
of a new Birth signifies, that
'tis intirely the work of the sanctifying
Spirit, that conveys a Principle of Life
in order to the Functions of it. 'Tis
the living impression of God, the sole
Efficient and Exemplar of it, the Fruit
and Image of the Divine Vertues. 'Tis
exprest by the <hi>new Creature.</hi> The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of it is attributed to God's
power displaying it self in a peculiar
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:99572:44"/>
excellent way, even in that precise
manner, as in making the World. For
as in the first Creation all things were
made originally of nothing, so in the
second, the habit of Grace is infused into
the Soul that was utterly void of it,
and in which there was as little prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for true Holiness, as of nothing
to produce this great and regular
World. And although there is not
only an absolute privation of Grace,
but a fierce resistance against it, yet cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
invincible Power does as infallibly
and certainly produce its effect in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the new Creature, as in making the
World. From hence it appears that
preventing renewing Grace is so intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Work of God; as his forming
the human Body from the Dust of
Earth at first. But with this difference,
the first Creation was done without
any sence in the Subject, of the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of the Divine Power in produce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it: but in the new Creation, Man
feels the vital influence of the Spirit,
applying it self to all his Faculties, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
and enabling them to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the quality of their nature.</p>
            <p>And by the way we may observe the
admirable Grace shewed to Man in the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:99572:44"/>
renovation of his corrupted Nature. In
the composition of his Being are united
a Spirit like the Angels, and a Body
like terrestrial Animals, by which he
partakes of the spiritual and natural
Life: but he has peculiar Favours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
upon him. For, whereas his
Soul sin'd with the Angels, and his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
dies with the Beasts, yet God is
pleased to restore them by his glorious
Power. An Angel after Sin never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,
and is therefore incapable of
Pardon, and irrecoverably disinherited
of Heaven: a Beast after Death never
revives: but though Man sins and dies,
yet his Soul may be renewed by Divine
Grace, and his Body shall be raised in
an incorruptible Glory.</p>
            <p>Now the indispensible necessity of
this holy Change is evident from the
Words of our Saviour, for he speaks
universally, <hi>Except a Man be born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
he cannot see the Kingdom of God.</hi>
He does not simply declare that an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate
Man shall not, but with the
greatest <hi>Emphasis,</hi> cannot, to signify
an absolute impossibility of it. The
<hi>Jews</hi> highly presumed of the priviledg
of their carnal Birth, they sprang from
the pure and noble Blood of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:99572:45"/>
God's Friend; they had the Seal of the
Holy Covenant markt in their Flesh:
and hence it was proverbial among
them, that every <hi>Israelite</hi> should have a
part in the World to come. But our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
overthrows this vain conceit, and
tells them that the supernatural Birth
entitles to the supernatural Inheritance.
Circumcision then, and Baptism now,
without real Grace is an ineffectual sign,
of no avail to Salvation.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 17.</note> In the quality of
Sons, we are Heirs of God's Kingdom.
And that honourable Relation we have
upon a double account;<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 7.</note> by Adoption
and Regeneration. Divine Adoption
is not a meer change of our state, a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Declaration that one shall be digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the Title of God's Son, but a
holy Nature is always infused into the
Person, whereby he is made like to God
in his Excellencies. In this it differs
from humane Adoption, that gives the
Name, and Arms, the Honour and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
of the Adopter to a Person, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
conveying any of his intellectual or
moral Endowments. Whom God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopts
he begets to a Divine Life. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
our Saviour purchased this high
priviledg for us: <hi>God sent his Son made
of a Woman, under the Law, to redeem
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:99572:45"/>
them that were under the Law, that we
might receive the Adoption of Sons.</hi> By U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with him we receive the investiture
of this Dignity. <hi>Now whoever is in Christ
is a new Creature.</hi> For the quickning Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that is to the Soul what the Soul
is to the Body, the principle of Life and
Strength, of Beauty and Motion, and
an active purifying Faith that is influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ential
upon all other Graces, are the
band of that vital Union: So that as all
in <hi>Adam</hi> are universally corrupt by the
first Birth, all that are in Christ are
made holy by a new Birth. But of this
I shall speak in the next Chapter more
fully, under a distinct Head. Briefly,
the Spirit of Grace that sanctifies, is the
Spirit of Adoption that seals our Right
to that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Now the reasons why this Change
must be in order to our obtaining of
Heaven, are these:</p>
            <p>1. There is an exquisite Wisdom shines
in all God's works, in disposing them
for the ends to which they are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
and is it not monstrously absurd
to imagin, he will admit into his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
and Kingdom, those that are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
unqualified for its Blessedness,
and opposite to its Purity?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:99572:46"/>
2. His invariable Justice excludes for
ever all unholy Persons from Heaven.
For in the last Judgment God will be
glorified as a Governour, in the distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
of Rewards with respect to the
Obedience and Disobedience of Men.
'Tis worthy of observation, that the
Actions of God on the reasonable
Creatures are of two sorts. Some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from his soveraign good Pleasure,
of which there is no motive or reason
in the Subjects on which they are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated.
Thus by a free and insupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Decree (when all Mankind, lapst
and miserable, was in his view) he
chose some to be <hi>Vessels of Mercy,</hi> and
by priviledg separated them from the
rest that finally perish. Now what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc't
him to place a singular Love on
the Elect? There was nothing in them
to incline his Compassion, being equally
guilty and depraved with the rest of the
Progeny of <hi>Adam.</hi> This difference
therefore is to be resolved into his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable
and adorable Will, as the
sole cause of it. Thus God declares it
to be his glorious Prerogative, <hi>I will
have Mercy on whom I will have Mercy,
and I will have Compassion on whom I will
have Compassion.</hi> And this is no unjust
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:99572:46"/>
acceptance of Persons: For as a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor,
he may dispense his own Favors
as he pleases. A Gift from meer and
arbitrary Bounty may be bestowed on
some, and not on others without inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.
But there are other actions of
God for which there is an evident rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in Men on whom they are termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated.
Thus as the supreme <hi>Judg, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
respect of Persons,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 17.</note> he will judg and
reward <hi>every Man according to his Works.</hi>
The Evangelical Law (as was toucht<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 16.</note>
on before) is the rule of eternal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Acts 26. 18.</note>
and gives a right from the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Promise of God, to all penitent
Believers in the Kingdom of Heaven,
and excludes all impenitent Infidels.
Divine Justice will illustriously appear
then in distinguishing Believers from
Unbelievers by their Works, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Fruits either of Faith or Infidelity.
All the thick Clouds of Disgraces, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies,
Persecutions, that often op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the most sincere Christians here,
shall not then darken their Holiness,
and all the specious appearances of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which the most artificial Hypocrites
make use of to deceive others, shall not
conceal their Wickedness. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
the one shall be absolved and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:99572:47"/>
glorified, the others condemned and
punisht for ever. In short, without
violation of his own righteous establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Gospel,<note place="margin">Heb. 1<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 14.</note> God cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the unholy into his Glory.</p>
            <p>3. Besides the Legal Bar that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
unsanctified Persons from the
beatifick vision of God, there is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
incapacity. Suppose that Justice
should allow Omnipotence to translate
such a Sinner to Heaven, would
the Place make him happy? Can
two incongruous Natures delight
in one another? The happiness of
Sense is by an impression of Pleasure
from a suitable Object: The happiness
of intellectual Beings arises from an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
conformity of dispositions. So that
unless God recede from his Holiness,
which is absolutely impossible, or Man
be purified, and changed into his like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
there can be no sweet Communion
between them. Our Saviour assigns
this Reason of the necessity of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in order to our admission into
Heaven: <hi>That which is born of the flesh,
is flesh; and that which is born of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
is spirit.</hi> According to the quality
of the Principle, such is what proceeds
from it. The Flesh is a corrupt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:99572:47"/>
and accordingly the Natural Man
is wholly carnal in his propensions, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
and end. The Disease is turn'd
into his Constitution. He is dead to
the Spiritual Life, to the actions and
enjoyments that are proper to it: Nay,
there is in him a surviving Principle of
Enmity to that Life: not only a mortal
coldness to God, but a stiff aversation
from him, a perpetual resistance and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
of the Divine Presence, that
would disturb his voluptuous enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
The Exercises of Heaven would
be as the Torments of Hell to him,
while in the midst of those pure Joys his
inward inclinations vehemently run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the lowest Lees of Sensuality. And
therefore till this contrariety, so deep
and predomanant in an unholy Person,
be removed, 'tis utterly impossible he
should enjoy God with satisfaction. As
it was necessary that God should become
like Man on Earth, to purchase that Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
for him, so Man must be like God
in Heaven before he can possess it. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
alone prepares Men for Celestial
Happiness; that is against the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and above the perfection of meer
Nature.</p>

            <head type="sub">Faith in the Redemer is required of all
that will obtain Salvation. The choice

Qualities and Effects.</head>
            <p>I Shall now proceed to consider
more particularly what is requisite
in order to our obtaining of Heaven.</p>
            <p>1. Faith in the Redeemer is absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
required of all that will partake of
the Salvation purchased by him.<note place="margin">Joh. 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>God
so loved the World, that he gave his only
begotten Son, that whoever believes in him,
should not perish but have Eternal Life.</hi>
This is the Spirit and Substance of the
Gospel, therefore I will briefly unfold
it. The Son of God having assumed
the human Nature, and performed
what was necessary for the expiation of
Sin,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 8, 9.</note> the Father was so pleased with his
Obedience, that from his lowest State
he rais'd him to Divine Glory, and
gave him supream Authority, and all-sufficient
Power to communicate that
Glory to others. Thus our Saviour
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99572:48"/>
declares; <hi>Thou hast given him</hi> (i. e. <hi>the
Son) power over all Flesh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 17. 2.</note> 
               <hi>that he should
give Eternal Life to as many as thou hast
given him.</hi> And he exhorts the People,
<hi>Labour for that Meat that endures unto
Eternal Life,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 6.</note> 
               <hi>which the Son of Man shall
give unto you, for him hath God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sealed.</hi> Now this glorious Life is
not given to all, but only to those who
are united to him. As <hi>Adam</hi> the
principle of the carnal corrupt Nature,
derives Guilt and Death to all his Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
so Jesus Christ (who is opposed to
him) the Head and Prince of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
State, communicates Life and
Glory to his People. The Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
it,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 22.</note> 
               <hi>As in Adam all dye,</hi> his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Descendants are involv'd in his
Condemnation, <hi>even so in Christ shall all
be made alive:</hi> that is, all that are spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
united to him shall partake of
his glorious Resurrection. And St. <hi>John</hi>
tells us,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 12.</note> 
               <hi>He that hath the Son hath Life,
and he that hath not the Son hath not Life.</hi>
The having the Son, upon which our
right to Eternal Life depends, is believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in him. Faith has a principal Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
in receiving Christ, therefore
'tis exprest by that Act;<note place="margin">Joh. 1. 12.</note> 
               <hi>But as many as
received him, to them gave he power to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:99572:49"/>
become the Sons of God,</hi> (and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
Heirs of Glory) to as many <hi>as
believed on his Name.</hi> And Christ is
said <hi>to dwell in our Hearts by Faith.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 3. 17.</note> This
is not a meer assent to the Doctrines of
the Gospel concerning the Dignity of
his Person, that he is in so high and
glorious a Relation of being the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Son of God, and the infinite value
of his Merits, whereby he is able to save
all that come unto God by him, and his
merciful compassionate Nature to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
returning Sinners, and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the benefits purchased by him,
but such a Belief as sways the Will and
Affections to receive him upon God's
terms for our Salvation. Faith is seated
in the whole Soul, in the Mind and
Heart, and accepts of Christ intirely as
Prophet, Priest and King. The parts
of the Mediator's Office, are inseparably
connected, and all the Effects of them
are communicated to the same Persons.
<hi>Jesus Christ is made of God to Believers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.</note>
               <hi>Wisdom,</hi> to cure their Ignorance and
Folly, <hi>Righteousness</hi> to abolish their
Guilt, <hi>Sanctification</hi> to renew their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<hi>and Redemption</hi> to free them at
last, from the Grave and bring them to
Glory. From hence 'tis clear, that the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99572:49"/>
Faith, which is justifying and saving, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
in its Nature, as dependance and
trust in Christ as a powerful and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Mediator, that is able and willing to
reconcile us to God, and make us for
ever happy in his Favour; so a sincere
resolution of Obedience and Subjection
to all his holy Commands, even to the
plucking out of the right Eye, and the
cutting off the right hand, the parting
with the most pleasing or profitable
Sins. For the Promises of God that are
the Rule of Faith, make an offer of
Christ upon these Conditions to us:
<hi>Him hath God exalted with his right hand,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 5. 31.</note>
               <hi>to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give
repentance to</hi> Israel <hi>and forgiveness of Sins.</hi>
And only <hi>the Justified shall be glorified.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note>
Those therefore who desire a partial
interest in him as a Saviour, out of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
necessity, to escape Hell, and
will not out of Love submit to him as
their Prince, have not <hi>that Faith that is
unfeigned,</hi> and gives a title to Eternal Life
by the Promises of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>2. We must chuse Heaven as our su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Happiness, and regard it as the
main end of our Lives. Man fell from his
Duty and Felicity by preferring sensual
Pleasure before the Favour of God, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99572:50"/>
became guilty of the greatest Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Dishonour to his Maker, and
is restored by the holy change of his
Will, the setting his Affections on a
pure Spiritual Blessedness. This subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the Will, and turning its Love and
Choice from the Creatures to God, is
the effect of Divine Grace, and wrought
in a rational way. For Man is not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
as artificial Engines by force, nor
as Brutes from necessity, their Faculties
being determined by the outward appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of Objects: he is not drawn up
to Heaven by such a natural impression,
as Steel by the Load-stone, nor forc'd by
a violent motion as a Stone ascends, but
as an understanding free Agent, by the
direction of the enlightned Mind, and
the consent of the Will, an elective un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constrained
Faculty. And herein the
Wisdom, Goodness and Equity of God's
Transactions with Man appears. His
Wisdom, in that as he has ordered in
the whole sphere of Nature, that the
active Powers of every Creature, be
drawn forth into exercise for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
and accordingly he is pleased
to work in and by them, so the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and Will, the Principles of
Operation in Man, are to deliberate
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99572:50"/>
and choose in order to his Happiness.
Otherwise the rational Faculties would
be in vain. His Goodness and Equity,
in that he sets before them Eternal Life
as the Reward of Obedience. God
will be glorified by him as a Law-giver
and a Benefactor, and has ordained in
the Gospel, that all who chuse and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
seek the Kingdom of Heaven
shall infallibly obtain it, and none be
deprived of it, but for their neglect.
The Decree of a final state of Misery,
though not in time, yet is consequent
in the order of causes to the obstinate
reluctancy of Sinners against restoring
Grace, and the wilful forsaking their
own Mercies. Therefore God vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
the Equity of his Proceedings
with Men by their own Principles, and
with tender pity expostulates, <hi>Why will
ye dye?</hi> The corrupt Will declining
from God, and adhering to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as its Happiness, is the true cause
of Mans ruin. This will infinitely clear
the Wisdom and Justice, the Purity and
Goodness of God from all Imputation.</p>
            <p>The choice of Heaven for our
Felicity is primarily to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
for 'tis from the prospect of
it, that all holy Counsels derive
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:99572:51"/>
their Life and Vigour. As in drawing
the Picture of a Man, the first work is
to delineate the Head, not only as the
part that in dignity and eminence is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the rest, but as it regulates the
drawing of the other parts, and gives a
just proportion and correspondence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, without which the whole
Figure becomes disordered and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous.
Thus in the moral considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Man, that which is primarily to
be considered is the Soul, and its final
Felicity, as incomparably more excellent
than the Body and its Pleasures: for this
will have a powerful influence upon
the whole Life, directing to avoid what
is inconsistent and impertinent, and to
do what is conducive to it.</p>
            <p>Now this being a matter of unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
importance, I will first shew what
the regular choice of Heaven includes,
as to its Qualities and Effects. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
direct how to make this Choice.
Thirdly, present some powerful Motives
to excite us to it.</p>
            <p>The Qualities of this Choice are
three. First, it must be sincere and
cordial. Secondly, early, in our first
and best days. Thirdly, firm and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:99572:51"/>
1. It must be sincere and cordial.
The most essential and active desire in
human Nature is to Happiness, but
there being two kinds of good things
presented to the Will, that solicit the
Affections, the pleasures of Sense, and
spiritual Joys, from hence it is that that
which makes Men happy is the object
of Election. And although there is
nothing more uniform and inviolable
than the natural inclination to Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
yet the great distinction of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
arises from this source, the regular
or perverse use of this inclination, the
wise or mistaking choice of Happiness.
Now the Sincerity of our Choice is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
when 'tis clear and entire, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
from a transcendent esteem of the
favour and enjoyment of God as our
chief Good, and absolutely requisite
for us. The Choice of true Happiness,
necessarily includes the despising and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
of the false Happiness that stands
in competition with it. There cannot
be two reigning Principles in the Soul:
for it cannot vigorously apply it self to
two Objects at the same time. Our
Saviour has decided it, <hi>No Man can
serve two Masters, for either he will hate
the one and love the other, or hold to the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:99572:52"/>
one, and despise the other: ye cannot serve
God and Mammon.</hi> The Masters are
irreconcileable, and their commands are
directly opposite. It was as possible
to place upon the same Altar the Ark
of God, and the Idol of the <hi>Philistins,</hi>
as that Heaven and the World should
compound and take equal shares in our
Affections. Indeed if the conceptions
in the Mind are but faint and floating of
the universal satisfying Goodness of the
Object proposed to make us happy, the
Will remains in suspence; but when 'tis
clearly and strongly represented, the
Heart is drawn intirely to embrace it.
Divine Grace by the illumination of the
Understanding purifies and changes the
depraved Will, and heals the distempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Affections. The wise Merchant
that had a discerning Eye saw reason
enough to part with all, that he might
gain the <hi>Pearl of Price,</hi> the Grace and
Glory of the Kingdom of Heaven. The
Apostle declares his resolute contempt
of the concurrence of all the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
either the Law or the World could
afford him, that he might have an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in Christ, the Reconciler and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storer
of Man to the Favour and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
of God. <hi>But what things were
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:99572:52"/>
gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ;
yea doubtless I count all things but loss for
the Excellency of the Knowledg of Jesus
Christ my Lord, for whom I have suffered
the loss of all things, and do count
them but dung, that I might win Christ.</hi>
The glorious Gospel is the brightest and
most pleasant Light that ever shone up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the World, a revelation of the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Wisdom and most admirable Love,
wherein the combination of God's holy
and wonderful Counsels for our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is unfolded, and accordingly St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
with the greatest Life of Affection sets
forth his value of it, and by full and
most vilifying Expressions rejects all
things in comparison of it.</p>
            <p>2. The Sincerity of the Heavenly
Choice is discovered by a zealous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance
of the means requisite in order
to it. Inanimate things incline to rest
in their Centre, the rational intend and
pursue it. The blessed End when va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
and respected according to its
worth, excites and directs the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Endeavours in that order and
measure as is proportionable to its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency;
and the difficulties of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it. There may be a naked estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and some desires of Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:99572:53"/>
simply considered, yet the Will
remain incompleat and undetermined
in its choice: for the End in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the Means is propounded to us,
and the carnal Man will not consent to
the Means. He dislikes the Holiness of
Religion, and will rather forfeit Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
than submit to such strict terms.
Though with <hi>Balaam,</hi> in a fit of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he says, <hi>O that I might die the death
of the Righteous, and that my last end
might be like his,</hi> yet from Indulgence
to his sensual Inclinations, he will not
live as the righteous. All his wishes of
true Happiness are soon strangled by the
predominant love of some Vanity. 'Tis
said of the <hi>Israelites, they despised the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
Land,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 106. 14.</note> not absolutely in it self, for it
was <hi>the Glory of all Lands,</hi> abounding
with things for the support and delight
of Man, but considering its distance, a
Wilderness waste and wild interposing,
and the Enemies to be encountred, they
did not think it worthy of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
such hazards and difficulties.
The Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was a Type of
Heaven, both with respect to its plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santness,
and the manner of the <hi>Israelites</hi>
obtaining it. Their Title to it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from the rich Bounty of God,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:99572:53"/>
therefore 'tis called the <hi>Land of Promise;</hi>
but it was to be possest by Conquest.
Thus the Celestial <hi>Canaan</hi> is the pure
gift of God, but the actual enjoyment
of it is obtained by victorious resistance,
against the Enemies of our Salvation.
And carnal Men despise this pleasant
Land, the Promise being inseparably
joined with Precepts of Duty and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
from which they are averse.
But he that chooses sincerely, is joyful
and vigorous in the use of means for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
his most desired good. Ardent
Affections, like <hi>Elijah</hi>'s Chariot of Fire,
ravish the Soul above this sensible
World, to the place where God dwells
in Glory. Zeal animates his endeavours,
as the Motion of the Heart diffuses the
Spirits into the Arteries, to convey
Life to all parts of the Body. <hi>One
thing</hi> (saith the inflamed Psalmist) <hi>have
I desired of the Lord, that will I seek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that I may dwell in the House of the
Lord all the days of my Life, to behold
the Beauty of the Lord, and to enquire into
his Temple.</hi> The sensual Man is ranging
abroad for satisfaction, and shoots all
the Game that crosses his Eye; but the
Soul that has a discovering light, and
feeling heat of the Divine Beauty, unites
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:99572:54"/>
all its desires in God, and with affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to an extasy longs for the enjoyment
of him, and the endeavours are in some
proportion to the desires. Our Saviour
tells us, <hi>That from the days of John the
Baptist until now, the Kingdom of Heaven
suffers violence, and the violent take it by
force.</hi> Some previous rays of the Sun
of Righteousness appeared in his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
and produc'd such a holy ardency
in those Converts, that with all resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
diligence and earnestness they sought
to be partakers of the Blessedness re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.
Lazy Desires, easy Prosecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
sluggish Attempts, discover that the
Heart is not througly engaged for the
spiritual Eternal Good. When the
End is truly designed it will give Law to
the Actions. This is visible in Men who
are wholly led by Sense, how sagacious,
how sollicitous are they to accomplish
their Ends and base Designs? They try
all ways either by fine Dissimulation, or
toilsome Industry to obtain their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires.
No time is too much in their
gainful Affairs, or voluptuous Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
They transform the Night to
lengthen out the Day for their Profit,
they vail the Day to lengthen out the
Night for their Ease and Pleasure. But
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:99572:54"/>
alas, Heaven is only regarded by the By;
as if the intellectual Soul were only
given to dwell with the Body on Earth,
the place of its Banishment, and direct
Affairs here below, and not to lead in
the way to Heaven, the place of its
Nativity, and prepare for another
World. The work of Salvation is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
with that remiss degree of Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
as if it were a slight matter whether
performed or neglected. These Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
carry their Conviction in their
Bosoms; for they are ardent and active
to obtain inferior and infinitely less con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Ends, but with that cold appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
mind the superior nobler End of
Man, that it is wholly frustrate, which
plainly shews it was never seriously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by them.</p>
            <p>3. The sincerity of our Heavenly
choice declares it self, in the temper and
frame of our Hearts with respect to all
temporal things in this World. For our
main and happy End being established,
that it consists not in secular Riches,
and Honours, and the Pleasures of Sense,
but in the clear vision of God, the
blessedness of the Spirit; it follows that
all present things are in our use so far
good or evil, and to be desired or not,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:99572:55"/>
as they are profitable or prejudicial to
our obtaining Salvation, as they conduct
or divert us from Heaven. A wise
Christian looks on temporal things not
through the Glass of disordered Passions,
that are impetuous and impatient for
what is grateful to them, but with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to his future Happiness. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders
the train of Temptations that
attend an exalted condition, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
such a portion of these things,
as may redound to the Glory of the
Giver, and be improved for his own
Salvation. This Purity of Affections
our Saviour teaches us: For in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
form of Prayer, the true directory
of our desires, are set down in an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
order all things we are to pray for.
And they respect the End, or the Means.
The End is the primary object of our
desires, accordingly the two first Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
concern our blessed End, as it
respects God and our selves. We pray,
<hi>hallowed be thy Name,</hi> that is, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
and adoration of all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
and, <hi>thy Kingdom come,</hi> that is,
for the manifestation of his Eternal
Glory in the next World, that we may
reign with him. The Means in order
to this End are of two sorts. Some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:99572:55"/>
to it by themselves, those are the
good things desired in the third and
fourth Petitions; and some lead to it by
accident, and those are the freedom from
evils exprest in the last Petition. The
good things desired either have a direct
influence upon our obtaining Happiness;
and they are sum'd up in our universal
obedience to God's Will, exprest in the
third Petition, <hi>let thy Will be done on
Earth as it is in Heaven;</hi> or they are
such as by way of subserviency promote
our Happiness, and those we pray for
in the fourth Petition, <hi>Give us this day
our daily Bread.</hi> And 'tis observable
there is but one Petition for Temporal
Blessings, and 'tis the last in the Order
of those that concern good things. And
that single Petition is so restrained,
that, 'tis evident by its Tenour, that
earthly things are not absolutely good
to be desired for themselves, but rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
and subordinately to our eternal
Good. Daily Bread we must ask of
our heavenly Father, the necessary sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of the present Life, without which
we cannot exercise our internal or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Powers and Faculties in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
but not Delicacies and Abundance
for the luxurious Appetite.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:99572:56"/>
The difference of Conditions in the
present World is very great: as in <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>'s
Dream, some Ears of Corn were
so full and weighty that they bended
with their weight, others so thin and
blasted, that they were as Stubble for the
Fire. Thus some abound in all Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities
possible in this Life, others are
<hi>chastened every Morning,</hi> under various
and continual Afflictions. Now this
infallible Principle being planted in the
Heart, that all present things are to be
improved with respect to our future
Happiness, will moderate the Affections
in Prosperity, so to use the World that
we may enjoy God, and make us not
only patient but pleased in Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,
as they are preparatory for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>The Original of all the Sins and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
of Men,<note place="margin">Frui est amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re alicujus rei inhaerere prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter seipsam, uti autem, quod in usum venerit, ad id quod amas obtinendum referre. <hi>Aug.</hi> de <hi>Doct. Christ.</hi>
               </note> is their perverse abuse of
things, by turning the Means into the
End, setting their Affections of Love,
Desire, and Joy upon sensible things, as
their proper Happiness, with inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
neglect of the spiritual eternal
state, to which all other things should be
subservient. As if one diseased and
sickly in a Forreign Country, that
could not possibly recover Health but
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:99572:56"/>
in his Native Air, in his return thither,
invited by the pleasantness of the way,
should take up his residence in it, and
never arrive to his own Country.
Among the <hi>West Indians</hi> some are
<note n="*" place="margin">Acosta.</note> reported to be so swift in running,
that no Horse can keep pace with
them, and they have a constant rule in
their Diet, to eat of no Beast, or Bird,
or Fish that is slow in motion, fancying
it would transfuse a sluggishness in them.
The Christian Life is by the Apostle
compar'd to a Race, and earthly things
by an inseparable property of Nature
load and depress the Soul, that it cannot
with vigour run the <hi>race set before it.</hi>
The Believer therefore who intends <hi>for
the high price of his Calling,</hi> and is true to
his end, will <hi>be temperate in all things.</hi>
Nay he will not only be circumspect
lest they should check with his great
Design, but wisely manages them in
subserviency to it. St. <hi>Paul, charges
them that are rich in this World,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tim. 6. 18, 19.</note> 
               <hi>to do good,
to be rich in good Works, ready to distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
willing to communicate, laying in
store for themselves a good Foundation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the time to come, that they may lay
hold of eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the fixed aim at Heaven as our
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:99572:57"/>
Felicity, will reconcile an afflicted state
to us. When temporal Evils are effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
means to promote our everlasting
Happiness, the amiableness and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the End changes their Nature,
and makes those Calamities that in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are intolerable, to become light
and easy. <hi>The Poor, the Mourners, the
Persecuted are blessed now, because theirs
is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> The Apostle,
though under variety of sharp troubles,
yet expresses his sence with that mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as but lightly toucht with them:
<hi>as sorrowful, but always rejoicing.</hi> From
hence he tells us, that with unfainting
courage he prosecuted his glorious End.
<hi>For our light afflictions that are but for a
moment, worketh for us a far more exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
weight of Glory.</hi> This seriously be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
and considered, will make us
understand the Harmony and Consent
of the most discordant parts of God's
Providence. This will reconcile the
severity and roughness of his Hand, with
the tender Compassions of his Heart
towards his Servants. This will dry up
Rivers of unprofitable Tears that flow
from the afflicted, and make the Cross
of Christ a light burthen. For their
heaviest Afflictions are not only consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:99572:57"/>
with his Love, but the Effects of
it, being influential upon their Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
<hi>Whereas the prosperity of Fools
shall slay them,</hi> and their good things
here aggravate their Miseries here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>4. The sincere choice of Heaven as
our final Happiness, will make us aspire
to the greatest height of Holiness we
are capable of in the present state. For
the End has always a powerful virtue
to transform a Man into its likeness:
and Heaven is a state of perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to the Holy God. This
difference is observable between the
Understanding and the Will in their
Operations: The Understanding in
forming Conceptions of things, draws
the Object to it self. The Will is drawn
by the Object it chooses, and is always
fashioning and framing the Soul into an
intire conformity to it. Thus carnal
Objects when propounded as the End
of a Man, secretly imprint on him their
likeness, his Thoughts, Affections, and
whole Conversation is carnal. As the
Psalmist speaks of the Worshippers of
Idols,<note place="margin">Psal. 115. 8.</note> 
               <hi>they that make them are like unto
them, so is every one that trusteth in them:</hi>
whatever we adore and esteem, we are
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:99572:58"/>
changed into its Image. Idolaters are
as stupid and senceless, as the Idols to
which they pay Homage. Thus when
God is chosen as our supream Good and
last End, by conversing with him the
Image of his glorious Holiness is derived
on the Soul, and it becomes Godly:
the Heart is drawn by his attractive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,
and the Life directed to him.
This being a point of great importance,
I shall further prove and illustrate it.
There is no deliberating about the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of that which is loved for it self
as our End. More or less may respect
the Means that are valued and used to
obtain it, but the love of the End is
vast and unlimited. A Physician en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to recover his Patient to sound
and perfect Health, that being the End
of his Art. He that seeks for Honour
or Riches, is not content with a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocrity
of Success, but drives on his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
to the full period of his Desires.
An ardent Lover of Learning with a
noble jealousy strives to excel others in
Knowledg. In short, no Man designs
and longs for a thing as his Happiness,
but will use all diligence to gain the
present and full Possession of it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it cannot be imagined that any
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:99572:58"/>
Person sincerely propounds the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Heaven as his End, but Love
will make him fervent and industrious
to be as Heavenly as is possible here.
He will strive by blessed and glorious
Gradations to ascend to the perfection
of his aims and desires, <hi>to be holy as God
is holy in all manner of Conversation, to be
pure as Christ is pure.</hi> We have an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
instance of this in St <hi>Paul</hi> who
declares,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>Brethren, I count not my self, to
have apprehended: but this one thing I do,
forgetting those things which are behind,
and reaching forth unto those things which
are before, I press toward the mark, for
the price of the high calling of God in Christ
Jesus.</hi> His Progress was great, yet that did
not make him slack in the prosecution
of his End. He laboured to attain the
President of our Saviour, to feel the
Power of <hi>his Death and Life, to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
Christ</hi> intirely and perfectly <hi>as
Christ had apprehended him. He was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
diligent</hi> to improve the Divine Image
in his Heart and Life.</p>
            <p>From hence we may discover the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their Hopes, that are of luke-warm
Affections in Religion, (the abhorr'd cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of <hi>Laodicea</hi>) who esteem it a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Principle, as convenient for their
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:99572:59"/>
carnal ease and interest, not to be <hi>earnest
in following Holiness.</hi> Vices in mediocrity
are tolerable with them, only the excess is
condemned. They content themselves
with a mediocrity in Religion, and are
presumptuous and secure, as the Church
that said, <hi>I am rich, and have need of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
They boast as if they had found
out the temperate Region between the
burning Line and the frozen Pole.
They account all that is above their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
in Religion, to be furious or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreet
Zeal, and all below to be dead,
cold Profaneness. They censure those
for Hypocrisy or unnecessary Strictness,
who are visibly better, and stand upon
proud comparisons with those who are
visibly worse. And thus set off them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by taxing others. But how easily
do Men deceive and damn themselves?
Can we have too much of Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Earth? Can we become too like
God, when a perfect conformity to him
is our Duty and Felicity? Indeed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Vertue consists in a Mediocrity, not
of the habitual Quality, but of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and Actions between the vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
extremities. Fortitude consists in
the mean between Cowardise, and rash
Boldness, but how much the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:99572:59"/>
the couragious Habit is, so much
the more a Man excells in that Virtue.
Liberality consists between an indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
Profuseness, and sordid Avarice.
Patience between a soft Delicacy, and
stupid Insensibility. Thus Philosophic
Virtue glories in its Beauty as pure and
intire, between two vicious Deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
And the Religion of many is Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganism
drest up in a Christian Fashion.
But this mediocrity only belongs to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Vertues, that respect things of
created limited goodness, and is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
according to the worth of their
Nature. But divine Graces respect an
object supreamly Good, and their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
consists in their most excellent
degrees, and the most intense Affections
and Operations that are leading to it.
Faith in its Obedience, Hope in its As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance,
Love in its Ardour can never
exceed. When the Object is Infinite, a
mediocrity is vicious. Humility can
never descend too low, nor Love as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
too high: for reflecting upon our
natural and moral Imperfections, that
we were raised from nothing, that we
are defiled and debased with Sin, we
cannot have too low thoughts of our
selves. And since God the Soveraign
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:99572:60"/>
Being, infinite in Perfections, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
amiable is the Object, no bounds
or measure must be set to our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but with all our united Powers,
<hi>all the Heart, and with all the Soul, and
with all the Mind, and with all the Strength,
we must love him,</hi> and please him, and
endeavour to be beloved of him.</p>
            <p>There are others will acknowledg
their defects, and tell you they do not
pretend to eminent Sanctity, to the
Graces of the Apostles and Martyrs, nor
aspire to their degrees in Glory, they
are content with a lower place in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and less strict Religion is sufficient
for their purpose. This deceit is
strengthned by Popery, that enervates
and dissolves many of our Saviour's
Precepts, by teaching they are not Laws
obliging all Christans to Obedience,
that will attain to eternal Life, but
Counsels of Perfection: if they are not
done 'tis no Sin, and the performance
of them meritoriously intitles to a richer
Crown. And though Men by impure
Indulgencies please their sensual Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
yet by tasting Purgatory in the
way, they may come to Heaven on
easier terms than a universal respect to
God's Commands, and an equal care to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:99572:60"/>
observe them. But Death will confute
all these feeble wretched Pretences, for
though the Saints above shine with an
unequal brightness, as the Stars differ
in Glory: yet none are there but
Saints. And those who do not mourn
under their Imperfections, and unfein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
desire and endeavour to be better
were never really good. The sloathful
Servant that did not waste but neglect
to improve his Talent, was cast into
<hi>outer darkness.</hi> There are different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of punishments in Hell, but the
least miserable there are miserable for
ever. In short 'tis a perfect contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
a Prodigy, for any Man to think
he is sincere in his Choice, and prepar'd
in his Affections for the pure glorious
Felicity in Heaven, that does not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to <hi>cleanse himself from all pollutions
of Flesh and Spirit, and to perfect Holiness
in the fear of God.</hi>

and Strength. When we are surrounded
with inticing Objects, and the Sense
are entire and most capable to enjoy
them, when the electing Powers are it
their vigour, then 'tis just we should
live to God, obey him as our Law-giver
and prefer the fruition of him in Heaven,
the reward of Obedience, before as
the pleasures of Vanity. 'Tis very
honourable and pleasing to God to give
the Heart to him, when the Flesh and

it. 'Tis a high endearment of the So<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

And 'tis an unspeakable satisfaction to
the Spirit of a Man, to declare the Truth

despising all Temptations when they

neglect their Duty and defer their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness?
They think it too soon to live
for Heaven before <hi>the evil days come

            <p>The Devil is a Sophister in perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and his ordinary and successful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice
to elude the force of present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,
and wrap Men in Sin and
Damnation, is to induce them to delay
the great work of the Soul till after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
He is not so foolish to tell them
as he did our first Parents, <hi>ye shall not
die,</hi> for the Temptation is so palpable
that it could deceive none. Though
the evidence and certainty of superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Truths that disturb the security of
Sinners is sometimes obscur'd by affected
doubts, yet there is no artifice that can
resist the full and strong conviction in
Mankind, That Death is inevitable.

Though Nature recoils from it with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence,
yet this sad Truth is so visible
that it forces an assent from all. Those
who are titular Gods are not so vain as
to pretend to an exemption by privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
from that fatal necessity, not to
fancy that they may be imbalm'd alive,
and Nature made incorruptible by Art.
The Pallace is as near the Grave as the
Cottage. Therefore the Devil cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes
in Men fond hopes of long Life.
As some Optick Glasses deceive the
sight, and make a superficial represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in Colours on a Wall but two or
three steps distance, appear a long deep
Gallery. Thus the Tempter by a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
artifice presents to the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the fatal term at a great distance, and
since he cannot weaken the certainty of
Death in Mens Belief, he removes the
Image of it out of their Memories, to
lessen the impression that it is capable to
make on their Spirits. They dare not
venture to die as they live careless of
Salvation, and unprepared for their
accounts with God; therefore to suspend
the workings of Conscience by a seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
compliance, the Tempter insinuates,
there will be a long interval between
the present time and the last hour, that
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:99572:62"/>
shall decide their state for ever, that it
will be a convenient season to prepare
for the other World when they have
done with this, as if Repentance were
best at last, when there are no Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and therefore no danger of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
it.</p>
            <p>And the Heart of Man is a great
Flatterer, very subtile to deceive and
ruin him with vain resolutions of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
retirement, and becoming seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
Religious hereafter, and thus by
an easy permission he gratifies the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
desires of the Flesh, and goes in a
Circuit from one Vanity to another, till
Death surprise the Presumer. 'Tis very
applicable to this purpose what is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of <hi>Alcaeus</hi> the Poet,<note place="margin">Athen. <hi>l.</hi> 20. <hi>c.</hi> 9.</note> who from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
season of the Year took Arguments
to give a new title to his intemperance.
The Spring requir'd liberal drinking in
sign of Joy for the renovation of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
The Summer to temper the heat,
and refresh our draught; 'Twas due to
Autumn as dedicated to the Vintage;
and Winter requir'd it to expel the
Cold, that would congeal the Blood
and Spirits. Thus he pleaded for the
allowance of his Excess. And thus Men
in the several Ages of Life, (which are
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:99572:63"/>
correspondent to the seasons of the
Year) have some Excuses to delay Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and give some colour to their
contumacy in neglecting Salvation.
The Vanity of Childhood, the Pleasures
of Youth, the Business of Middle Age,
the Infirmities of old Age are plausible
pretences to put off the seeking the
Kingdom of Heaven and the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
thereof. Now to excite us to a
present choice and pursuit of eternal
Happiness, Let us consider,</p>
            <p>1. This Life is the only season allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us for preparation in order to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortallity.
As we improve or neglect
it, we shall be for ever. 'Tis observ'd
concerning the <hi>Straights</hi> where the Sea
is but a few miles broad,<note place="margin">Tam modico ore tam im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensa aequo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum vastitas panditur. <hi>Plin.</hi>
               </note> yet from thence
it pours it self into the vast Ocean that
extends to both the <hi>Indies.</hi> So this
Life that is confin'd within the straits of
Time, issues it self into a boundless E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
of Good or Evil. From a few
years, well or ill spent here, <hi>tam im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensa
soeculorum vastitas panditur,</hi> Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Ages follow of Happiness or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery.
If Men now <hi>set their affections on
things above,</hi> and earnestly seek them,
they shall joyfully ascend to the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the Saints in Light: for the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:99572:63"/>
preparation for Happiness is here, the
perfection of it hereafter. But if they
are <hi>carnally minded,</hi> and the main design
of their lives be to enjoy the present
World, when the parting hour is come,
and Death shall make a separation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them and it, their Misery is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable
as the Grave. Indeed if we
had two lives in succession allowed us
for tryal, and having err'd in our choice
of Happiness in the first, might correct
our errour in a second Life, there were
some pretence for security: but since
immediately after Death a private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
passes upon the Soul, without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to a more favourable Tribunal,
since then the errour is unpardonable
for ever, there is no stupidity equals the
present neglect of Salvation.</p>
            <p>2. Let us consider the desperate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties
upon which Men build their
Hopes of a future Repentance and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Acceptance.</p>
            <p>1. Men are flattered with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
of long Life. But what is
more uncertain? 'Tis the Wisdom and
Goodness of God to keep concealed in
his own Counsels the time of our so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing
here; for if Men though li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to Death every hour, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:99572:64"/>
should be under a just fear lest it
surprise them unprepared, yet against
so strong a curb run with that exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
vehemence after the Vanities of the
World, how much more licentious
would they be, if secur'd from sudden
Death? But none can promise to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
one day: Death comes not according
to the order of Nature but the Divine
Decree. How many in the flower of
their Youth and Strength, thought
themselves at as great a distance from
Death as the East is from the West, when
there was but a step between them
and Death, between them and Hell.
The Lamp suddenly expires by a blast
of Wind, when there is plenty of Oil
to feed it. The rich Man pleas'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with designs of sensual enjoyments
for many Years, yet did not see the
dawning of the next Morning. <hi>Thou
Fool this Night shall thy Soul be required
of thee:</hi> This Sentence is now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
in Heaven against thousands
that are alive this day, conversant in
the Vanities and Businesses of the
World, Eating and Drinking, Playing
and Trading, and all unconcerned as
to Dying, yet shall breath their last be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to Morrow, and their unwilling
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:99572:64"/>
Souls be rent from the embraces of the
Body. In various manners Men die
suddenly from inward and outward
causes. An<note n="†" place="margin">Nos corpus tam putre sortiti nihilo minus aeterna proponimus: &amp; in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum potest ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas humana protendi, tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus; nulla contenti pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunia, nulla potentia. Quid hac re fieri impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentius, quid stultius po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test? Nihil satis est mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituris, nihil morientibus. <hi>Sen. Epist.</hi> 120.</note> Apoplexy, an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthume,
a Flux of Rhume, stopping
Respiration, kills the Body without any
presaging signs of Death. As if the
Roof and all the Chambers should fall
within the House, whiles the Walls are
standing. And how many unforseen
Accidents, and therefore inevitable, put
a sudden period to Life? Is it not then
the truest Wisdom to be early in our
work for Heaven, when the season is
certainly short, and uncertainly conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
and the omission is irreparable?
Therefore the Gospel represents the
coming of our Judg under different
images of surprisal; of <hi>a Thief,</hi> that by
the favour of the Night breaks into the
House; of <hi>a Master</hi> that returns from
abroad unexpected, to call his Servants
to an account: Of <hi>a Bridegroom</hi> that
makes his Nuptial entrance, at an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
of hour, when the wise and
foolish Virgins were asleep, Conscience
was slumbred in the Good and stupified
in the Bad, to keep us always vigilant
and prepared for that hour, that is the
end of Time, and beginning of Eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:99572:65"/>
2. Suppose Life be continued, yet
Sinners can have no rational hopes that
they shall sincerely repent. For,</p>
            <p>1. Saving Repentance is the Gift of
God. And is it likely that those who
have been insensible of the loud and
earnest calls of the Word, that have
been inflexible to the gracious methods
of Providence leading them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
should at last obtain converting
Grace? The gales of the Spirit are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
transient and blow where he pleases,
and can it be expected that those who
have wilfully and often resisted his pure
Motions, should by an exuberant Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
receive afterwards more powerful
Grace to overrule their stubborn Wills
and make them obedient? Our Saviour
tells us, <hi>To him that hath shall be given,</hi>
but to him that neglects the improving
spiritual Treasures, <hi>that which he hath
shall be taken away.</hi> There are special
seasons of Grace, as the passing of Christ
in the way where the blind men sate,
which neglected, are irrecoverably
lost. God has threatned that his <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
shall not always strive</hi> with rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
Sinners, and then their state
is remediless. This may be the case of
many even in this Life who are insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:99572:65"/>
of their Misery. As Consumptive
Persons decline by degrees, lose their
Appetite, Colour and Strength, till at
last they are hopeless, so the withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Spirit are gradual, his moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are not so frequent nor strong, and
upon the continued provocations of
Sinners finally leaves them under that
most fearful doom; <hi>He that is filthy let
him be filthy still; He that is unrighteous
let him be unrighteous still,</hi> and thus pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes
them on this side Hell, as he does
the damned, by giving them over to
Sin. Nothing therefore is more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
than the usual excuses
for the delays of Repentance. 'Tis
written as with a Sun beam, that
God will graciously pardon repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Sinners, but 'tis no where<note n="‖" place="margin">Nemo ergo sibi promit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat, quod E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelium non promit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit. <hi>Aug.</hi>
               </note> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that he will give repentance to those
who securely break his Laws upon a
corrupt confidence they will repent at
last. 'Tis a bloody adventure to indulge
their carnal Affections, as if they had
infallible assurance, the word of God
confirm'd by his Oath, that they should
not dye in an impenitent state.</p>
            <p>2. Supposing the Holy Spirit be not
totally withdrawn, yet by every days
continuance in an evil course the Heart
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:99572:66"/>
is more hardened against the impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Grace, and more incapable of
returning to God. 'Tis therefore the
subtilty of the old Serpent to make the
entrance of Sin easy, for he knows that
after sometime it will plead a right by
prescription, and with difficulty be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.
Custom is a second Nature,
and has a mighty power either in that
which is good or evil. <hi>Can the Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian
change his Skin, can the Leopard
change his spots, then may you who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
to do evil, do good.</hi> If Sin in its
infancy can make such resistance that
the Spirit of Grace is foil'd in his Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to rescue the Soul from its bondage,
how much more when 'tis grown into a
confirm'd habit? Therefore the Apostle
urges so emphatically, <hi>to day, while it
is called to day, hear the voice of God, lest
any be hardened through the deceitfulness
of Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. How uncertain is it whether God
will accept the Addresses of such at last?
We are commanded to <hi>seek the Lord
while he maybe found, and to call upon him
while he is near.</hi> The limitation implies
if the season be neglected, he will hide
his Face for ever. Now in cases of
great moment and hazard what
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:99572:66"/>
diligence, what caution should be
used?</p>
            <p>1. How derogatory is it to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
to offer to him the dregs of our
Age, the reliques of a licentious careless
Life spent in the works of Vanity? <hi>Is
this to give Glory to God?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 13. 16.</note> Contempt
provokes Superiors as much as actual
Injuries. And how vilifying is it of
his excellent Greatness, that Men lavishly
wast the best of their time upon their
Lusts and the World, and when through
weakness of Age, or the violence of a
Disease they can no more relish the
pleasures of Sin, then only to seek his
favour, and presume upon it, as if he
could not be happy without them, and
it were his interest to receive them. <hi>If
ye offer the blind for a Sacrifice is it not
evil? and if ye offer the lame and the sick
is it not evil? Offer it now to thy Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
will he be pleased with thee to accept
thy Person? saith the Lord of Hosts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Consider what Sincerity or moral
Value is in Religion that meerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from bitter constraint? 'Tis a rule
in Law, <hi>falsum est eam peperisse, cui
mortuae Filius extractus est.</hi> 'Tis not a
natural Birth when the Child is extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from the dead Mother. 'Tis not
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:99572:67"/>
Genuine Piety that is only extorted
by the Rack, whilst the Heart full of
aversion and reluctancy does not truly
consent. Pure Religion flows uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
from love to God. 'Tis the
Dreggs that come forth with pressing.
'Tis observed of the <hi>Israelites</hi> that <hi>when
God slew them they sought him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 78. 34, 36.</note> 
               <hi>and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and enquired early after God.</hi> But 'tis
added, <hi>Nevertheless they did flatter him
with their Mouths, and they lied to him
with their Tongues, for their Hearts were
not right with him, neither were they sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
in his Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Sinners are plunged in deep
distress, when the shadow of Death sits
upon their Eye-lids, they may with
plentiful effusions of Prayers and Tears
desire God to receive them to Heaven,
not to serve him there, not to enjoy
the Divine Presence, but as a Sanctuary
from revenging Justice, as a Refuge
from Hell. And will such Desires pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail?
what swells the Confidence of
Sinners, but unworthy Notions of
God, as if a forc'd and formal Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to him were sufficient to reconcile
his offended Majesty?</p>
            <p>3. There is nothing renders Men
more unworthy of Mercy than continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:99572:67"/>
in Sin upon presumption of an
easy Pardon at last. This is the most
common deceitful Principle upon which
they build their Hopes, as their Actions
that bear the image of their Minds clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
manifest. They think that God is
so gracious, such a lover of Souls, so
easy to be entreated, that upon their
dying Prayer, <hi>Lord, remember me in thy
Kingdom,</hi> the answer will be, <hi>To day
shalt thou be with me in Paradise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this presumptuous Indulgence
gives the deepest grain to their Sins,
and makes them more uncapable of
Pardon. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> observes that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
was encouraged to betray his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
presuming on his Lenity, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Benignity, which Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
intolerably aggravated his Treason,
and confounded his Hopes. There is a
dreadful threatning against those who
reject the invitations of Grace in their
Prosperity, and when the righteous
Judg comes to Sentence and Execution,
are earnest Suppliants for Mercy.<note place="margin">Prov. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I have called, and ye refused; I have
stretched out my Hands, and no Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded:
But ye have set at naught all my
Counsel, and would none of my Reproof:
I will also laugh at your Calamity, and mock
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:99572:68"/>
when your fear comes: when your fear
comes as a Desolation, and your destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as a Whirlwind, when distress and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
come upon you, then shall they call
upon me, but I will not answer, they shall
seek me early, but shall not find me; for
they hated knowledg, and did not choose the
fear of the Lord.</hi> A doleful case beyond
all possible expression, when the sinful
Creature, forsaken of all Comforts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
addresses to Heaven for Relief,
and meets with Derision and Fury,
Scorn and Indignation. The foolish
Virgins careless to prepare for the
Bridegrooms coming, in vain at last
discovered their want of Oil, in vain
sollicited the wise Virgins for a supply,
in vain knockt at the door crying, <hi>Lord,
Lord, open unto us:</hi> the answer was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
and peremptory, <hi>I know you not,</hi>
and they were for ever excluded from
Spiritual Joys.</p>
            <p>3. I will add further how incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
it is to delay the solemn work of
Reconciliation with God till the time
of Sickness. This is an affair wherein
our transcendent interest is concern'd,
and should be perform'd in our most
calm and sensible condition, when we are
most capable of reflecting upon our ways,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:99572:68"/>
and making an exact trial of our selves,
and returning to God by a holy Change
of our Lives. Now that the time of
Sickness is not a convenient season for
this Work, is sadly evident. For some
Diseases are stupifying, and all the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Spirit are benummed in a dull
Captivity, so that the sick Man only
perceives with his animal Faculties.
Some Diseases are tormenting, and
cause a great disorder in the Soul, and
wholly distract the Thoughts from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
his spiritual State. When the
Storm is at the highest, and the Pilot
so sick that he can give no Directions,
the Ship is left to the fury of the Winds,
and escapes by Maracle. When there
is a Tempest in the humours of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and the Soul by sympathy is so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composed,
that it cannot apply it self
seriously to prepare for the Divine Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal,
what danger of being lost, and
passing from a short Agony to everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Pains? Besides, suppose the Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
more tolerable, yet how unfit is a
Person weak and languishing,<note place="margin">Malè cum his agitur, quibus necessitas belli incumbit &amp; morbi. <hi>Veget.</hi>
               </note> when
Sence and Conscience are both afflicted,
to encounter with the cruel Enemy of
Souls? All that truly seek Peace with
God must expect fierce Anger and War
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:99572:69"/>
from Satan; therefore 'tis a point of
necessary Wisdom while we are possest
of Health and Strength, to be in a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
preparation against his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults.</p>
            <p>4. Consider how uncomfortable it is
to delay Repentance till Age and Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
when the Fruits of it are not so
evident and acceptable. In evil days
and the approaches of Death, 'tis very
hard to discover the sincerity of the
Heart, whether Repentance proceed
from holy Principles, whether the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
then exprest be Godly for Sin, or
meerly natural for Punishment; whether
the good resolutions be the effects of a
permanent Fidelity, or of violent Fear,
that will vanish, the cause being remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
When the invitations to Sin cease,
there may remain a secret undiscerned
love to it in the Heart, which is the
centre of Corruption, and root of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy.
The Snake that seemed dead
in the cold, revived by the Fire. The
inordinate Affection that seemed morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
when the sensitive Faculties were
disabled for carnal Enjoyments, may
have inward Life, and will soon be active
and vigorous in the presence of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And that a Death-bed Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:99572:69"/>
is usually deceitful, appears from
hence, that not one of a thousand who
recover from dangerous Diseases, are
faithful in performance of their most sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Vows to God. How many ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a Sentence of Death in themselves,
<hi>and under the terrours of the Lord,</hi> have
exprest the greatest detestation of their
Lusts, and resolved (as they thought
sincerely) that if God would spare
them, to reform their ways, to become
new refined Creatures, exemplary in
all holy Conversation: yet the danger
being over, their heats of devotion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
as they revive, and their lusts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
strength with their Bodies, and
having been supprest only by fear, are
more fierce in their return. Their
Hearts were as Marbles that in rainy
Weather seems dissolved into Water,
but 'tis only from the moisture of the
Air, and remain as hard as ever. All
their promises of Reformation are inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective,
as violent and void. Now if
these Persons had died before this visible
trial and discovery, they had past into
another World with the reputation of
true Penitents, deceiving others with
their Prayers and Tears, and liberal
Promises, the outward signs of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:99572:70"/>
and deceived themselves by the
inward workings of an alarm'd Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Therefore Ministers ought to be
very circumspect in applying the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of Mercy to Persons in such a
state: for an errour in that kind has
fearful Consequences. A little opiate
Divinity may quiet the Mind for a time,
but the virtue of it will be soon spent,
and the Presumer perishes for ever.</p>
            <p>But suppose a dying Person with true
Tears and unfeined persevering Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
returns to God, can he have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
assurance of his Sincerity? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Searcher and Judg of Hearts
will accept him, but how doubtful and
wavering are his Hopes, what anxious
Fears are in his Breast, lest he builds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a sandy Foundation? And how
dreadful is it to appear before the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal
of God, and expect an uncertain
Sentence?</p>
            <p>But Sinners still please themselves in
this, That God has effectually called
some at the last hour, and they may
find the same favour with others. To
this I answer.</p>
            <p>1. 'Tis true we have some rare admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
instances of God's Mercy and
Grace; the dying Thief, and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:99572:70"/>
which shew 'tis possible with
God to abolish the most vicious confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
habits in a short time, and by a
swift Conversion to prepare a Sinner for
Heaven. But these Examples are not
to be drawn into Consequence, for the
encouragement of any in their Sins. A
Prince will not indure that his<note n="*" place="margin">Quod ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cui gratiosè conceditur, trahi non de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet ab aliis in exemplum. <hi>Plut. Symp.</hi>
               </note> free
Favours should be made a Law to him,
and the special Priviledg of some be
extended to all. As <hi>Thales</hi> said, an old
Mariner that has escapt the various
dangers of the Seas, was a new Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle;
so that one who has lived an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
Sinner dyes a penitent Believer
is very rare and extraordinary. What
our Saviour said concerning the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of rich Men, is justly applicable in
this case, <hi>that it was as easy for a Camel
to go through the Eye of a Needle, as for
a rich Man to enter into the Kingdom of
Heaven.</hi> This so astonisht the Apostles,
that they cryed, <hi>who then can be saved?</hi>
To mitigate the difficulty, he remembers
them of the Divine Omnipotence, <hi>All
things are possible with God.</hi> Thus for
one that has been fitting himself for
Hell, and hardened in a constant course

only as Miracles are, by the efficacy

to prevent the sentence of Death,

of his Glorious Goodness in those who

finally miscarried in shooting that

are blinded with vain presumptions to

the last, that God is reconciled to them?
and a false Tranquillity is more terrible
than the storms of a troubled Spirit, for
those who hope upon deceitful grounds
are in the most hopeless state, neglecting
what is requisite in order to Salvation.
And thus innumerable pass in a cloud of
Ignorance to the Kingdom of Darkness.
And how many who have lived in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding

or the present fear of divine Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Conscience is awakened, and looks
into the depth of their Guilt, fall into
the other extream and dye despairing?
The Devil makes his advantage of the
timerous Conscience as well as of the
Obdurate. Solitude is his Scene as well
as the noisy Theatre, and by contrary
ways, either presumption or despair
brings Sinners to the same end. He
changes his methods according to their
Dispositions; the Tempter turns Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser,
and then such who had a dim-sight
of Sin before, have an overquick
sight of it, and are swallowed up in an
abyss of Confusion. The condition of
such is extreamly miserable. 'Tis obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of<note n="‖" place="margin">Miserrimum morbi genus, in que aeger &amp; siti &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quae metu cruciatur, quorum spes in angusto est. <hi>Cels.</hi>
               </note> those who are bit with a mad
Dog, that being tormented with thirst,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:99572:72"/>
yet so fearful of Water, that the sight
of it sometimes causes sudden Convulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Death; their Cure is extream
difficult, if not impossible. This is a
significant emblem of a despairing Soul.
For when the inraged Conscience bites
to the quick, the Sinner fill'd with estu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
and terrors, ardently thirsts for
Pardon, yet fearfully <hi>forsakes his own
Mercies.</hi> What ever is propounded
to encourage Faith in the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
he turns to justify his Infidelity.
Represent to him the infinite Mercies
of God, the unvaluable Merits of Christ
sufficient to redeem the lost World, it
hightens his despair, because he has
perversly abused those Mercies, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
those Merits. The most precious
Promises in the Gospel are killing ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
to him: as the sweet Title of
Friend, wherewith our Saviour recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>Judas</hi> when he betrayed him, was
the most stinging reproach of his perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
Villany. Thus it appears how
dangerous it is to delay our Repentance
and Reconciliation with God till Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and a Death-Bed, when the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
or forgetfulness of Sin, the sence
or security of Conscience may be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
destructive.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:99572:73"/>
I would not from what has been said,
discourage any who have lived in a
course of Sin, from earnest seeking to
God for his Mercy in their last hours.
Even then they are not utterly destitute
of hope. The Gospel sets forth the Mercy
of God to returning Sinners in various
forms, and expressions of incomparable
Tenderness. When the lost Sheep was
recovered, there was Joy, as if a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
had been found. The Prodigal
had wasted his Estate in Lust and Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury,
and by a harsh reduction came to
himself, reflected with shame upon his
Folly and Rebellion, and the sence of
his Misery (not a more ingenuous or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
principle at first) compell'd him to
go to his Father, to try what his Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
would do. And it was not a vain
Presumption, for he found the effects
of his compassionate Love. <hi>When he
was a great way off, his Father saw him,
and had compassion, and ran and fell on
his Neck and kissed him. And the Sun
said, Father, I have sinned against Heaven
and in thy sight, and am no more worthy
to be called thy Son. But the Father said
to his Servants, Bring out the best Robe,
and put a Ring on his Finger, and Shoes
on his Feet, and bring hither the fatted
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:99572:73"/>
Calf, and kill it, let us eat and be merry:
for this my Son was dead, and is alive again;
was lost, and is found.</hi> The design of
Christ was to represent his heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in that Parable, and to wounded
Spirits that feel the intolerable weight
of Sin, the Mercy and mildness of the
Gospel is to be shown. God is rich in
Mercy <hi>to all that call upon him in Truth.</hi>
But to tell Sinners who securely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in an habitual course of evil, that
they may be saved at last, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
their presumptuous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulses
of Gods calls to his Service, yet
they may come into the Vineyard at the
eleventh hour, and be rewarded, is to
give countenance and protection to Sin,
and to harden them to Destruction.
Poison is not cured by giving Food,
but Antidotes, that put Nature into a
Passion till it be expell'd. The <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
of the Lord</hi> can only prove medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal
to such depraved Souls.</p>
            <p>To conclude this Discourse; Let us
seriously consider the Revelation God
has made of himself in the Gospel as a
Father and a Judg: that Justice and
Holiness, as well as Mercy, are essential
to his Nature, that our Affections may
be accordingly moved towards him.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:99572:74"/>
               <hi>If ye call on the Father, who without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of Persons judgeth according to every
mans work, pass the time of your sojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
here in fear</hi> Presumption and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
are very dishonourable to God,
and pernicious to the Soul: the one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys
the Fear, the other the Love of
God. But Hope contemper'd with fear
hath an excellent influence in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Life. As the Ballast and the Wind
are both necessary that the Ship may go
safely and regularly: without the Winds
the Ship can make no way, and without
Ballast 'tis in danger of oversetting by
every gust. Thus Hope and Fear are
very useful to bring us safely to Eternal
Felicity. Fear without Hope stupifies
the vigour and alacrity of the Soul, that
it cannot come to God, and Hope
without Fear makes it vain and careless
of its Duty, and liable to be overthrown
by every pleasing temptation. Briefly,
let us rightly understand the tenour of
Evangelical Promises of Pardon and
Grace: they are conditional and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
only to penitent Believers. And
unfeigned Faith, the condition of our
Justification, purifies the Heart, works
by Love, and is the living Principle of
universal Obedience. And Repentance
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:99572:74"/>
unto Life is productive of all good
Fruits in their Season. <hi>Be not deceived,
God is not mocked, as a Man Sows so
shall he Reap. He that sows to the Flesh,
shall of the Flesh reap Corruption. He that
sows to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap
Life Everlasting.</hi>

            <head type="sub">Our Choice must be Constant. Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in a holy Life absolutely required
in order to attaining the Reward.
The various Temptations that assault
Christians, to divert them from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of Heaven. The Reason why Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance
is necessary. Cautions against
Presumption, and a vicious dejection of
Spirit.</head>
            <p>I Shall proceed next to consider that
our Choice must be firm and lasting,
victorious over all Temptations.</p>
            <p>The two principal Rules of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Life are to begin and end well:
to fix and establish the main design for
Everlasting Happiness, and from a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
Resolution and ratified pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:99572:75"/>
of Heart to pursue it with firmness
and constancy: to live for Heaven, and
with readiness and courage to dye for
it, if the Glory of God so require. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance
is indispensably necessary in
all that will obtain the Eternal Reward.</p>
            <p>For the clearing this most important
Point, I will first represent from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the Idea of Perseverance, that is
attended with Salvation. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Confider why 'tis so strictly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>I. Saving Perseverance includes the
permanent residence of Grace in the
Soul: 'Tis composed of the whole
Chain of Graces, the union of holy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
that are at first infused into a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
by the sanctifying Spirit. When
Eternal Life is promised to Faith, or
Love, or Hope, 'tis upon supposal that
those Graces being planted in the Heart
shall finally prosper.<note place="margin">Rev. 2.</note>

               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> 
               <hi>'Tis Love that never fails</hi> that shall
enter into Heaven. <hi>'Tis hope firm unto

glorious Fruition. If Grace be disseised
by a usurping Lust, Apostacy will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and the forfeiture of our right in
the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:99572:75"/>
2. Grace must be continually
drawn forth into exercise accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to our several states and duties,
and the various occasions that happen
in our course through the World. Those
<hi>who are light in the Lord are commanded to
walk as Children of the Light;</hi> to signify
the excellency and purity of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Life. <hi>Those who live in the Spirit
must walk in the Spirit;</hi> that is, by a
conspicuous course of Holiness declare
the vigour and efficacy of the divine
principle that is communicated to them.
<hi>Paulum sepultae distat inertiae celata vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus:</hi>
Virtue that breaks not forth into vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Actions is not worthy of the Name.
The meer abstaining from evil is not
sufficient, but all the positive acts of
the holy Life are to be constantly
done. In discharging both these parts
of our Duty, compleat Religion is
exprest, and the power of Grace
consists.</p>
            <p>3. Perseverance includes not only
continuance in well-doing, but fervour
and progress towards Perfection. There
are two fixt States, the one in Heaven,
the other in Hell. The blessed Spirits
above are arrived to the height of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness.
The Devil and damned Spirits
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:99572:76"/>
are sunck to the lowest extremity of
Sin. But in the middle state here,
Grace in the Saints is a rising growing
Light, and Sin in the Wicked improves
every day, like Poison in a Serpent
that becomes more deadly by his Age. We
are injoined not to remain in our first
Imperfections, but to <hi>follow Holiness</hi> to
the utmost issue of our Lives, to its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
consummation. For this end all
the dispensations of Providence must
be improved whether prosperous
or afflicting. And the Ordinances
of the Gospel were appointed that
in the use of them we may be <hi>chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
into the divine Image from Glory to
Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Perseverance is required notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all Temptations that may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
or terrify us from our Duties;
what ever affects us one way or other,
while we are cloathed with frail Flesh.
'Tis the fundamental Principle of
Christianity declared by our Saviour,
<hi>If any Man will come after me,</hi> that is, be
my Disciple, and Servant, <hi>let him deny
himself, and take up his Cross and follow
me;</hi> even to be crucified with him,
rather than wilfully forfeit his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity

promised. He that endures to the End</hi>
(notwithstanding the most terrible Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
to which he is exposed for Christ's
sake) <hi>shall be saved.</hi> In this a Christian
must be the express image of his Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<hi>who for the joy that was set before
him endured the Cross; despised the shame,
and is set down at the right hand of God.</hi>
Disgrace and Pain are Evils that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature has a most tender sence
of, yet the Son of God with a divine
generosity and constancy endured them
in the highest degrees. He was scorn'd
as a feigned King, and a false Prophet.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:99572:77"/>
He suffered a bloody Death, and by the
Cross ascended to Glory. And we must
follow him, if we desire to be where he is.</p>
            <p>2. But this is not the only trial of
a Christian. Prosperity is a more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Enemy to the Soul, though Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
be more rigorous.</p>

but 'tis made weak and careless by what
is grateful to the sensual Inclinations.
It keeps close the Spiritual Armour in
the open encounter of Dangers that
threaten its ruin, but is inticed to put
it off by the caresses and blandishments
of the World. It does not see its Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
under the disguise of a pleasant
Temptation. Thus Sin insinuates its
self, and by stealing steps gets into the
Throne without observation. A Man
is wounded with a pleasant Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as with the Plague, that flies in the
dark, and Grace is insensibly weaken'd.
From hence it is that Adversity often
reforms the Vicious, and Prosperity
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:99572:77"/>
corrupts the Vertuous. Now Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
must be of proof against Fire
and Water, against what ever may
terrify or allure us from our duty.</p>
            <p>5. Saving Perseverance excludes not
all Sins, but total Apostacy, and final
impenitency, which are fatal and deadly
under the New Covenant. <hi>If the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
turneth away from his righteousness,
and committeth Iniquity,</hi>

and in his Sin that he hath sinned he
shall die. If any Man draw back,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 38<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>my
Soul shall have no pleasure in him, saith
the Lord.</hi> These Threatnings imply,
there is a possibility of the Saints falling
away considered in themselves, but
not that they are ever totally deserted
by the Holy Spirit, and left under the
reigning Power of Sin. The Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
are intended to awaken their
Care, and are Preservatives of them
from Ruine, and have a singular Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
on their Perseverance. A vigilant
and cautious Fear establishes the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of their Hope. Indeed from the
Reliques of weakness and corruption
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:99572:78"/>
in the Saints, they sometimes actually
fall into presumptuous Sins, and by
rebellious relapses wound Conscience,
and let out much of the vital Spirits,
their Graces and Comforts. But though
the divine Nature in them is miserably
wasted by such Sins, yet 'tis not abolisht.
As after the Creation of Light, there
was never pure and total Darkness in
the World. Grace does not consist in a
Point, but is capable of Degrees. The
new Creature may decline in Beauty
and Strength, yet Life remain. Between
a lively and a dead Faith there may be
a fainting Faith; as in St. <hi>Peter,</hi> for
certainly our Saviour was heard in his
Prayer for him, that his <hi>Faith should
not fail</hi> in his dreadful Temptation.
The Saints do not by a particular fall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish
the first living Principles of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
Faith and Love; nor change
their last end by an entire turning from
God to the World. In short, a single
act of Wickedness does not reduce them
into a state of Unregeneracy: for 'tis
not the matter of the Sin singly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
but the disposition of the Sinner
that denominates him. If Grace in the
Saints should utterly perish, as some
boldly assert, their recovery would be
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:99572:78"/>
impossible. For the Apostle tells us,
that <hi>if those who were enlightned, and had
tasted of the Heavenly Gift,</hi> that had been
under some common Workings and
lower Operations of the Spirit, if such
<hi>fall away universally,</hi> and live in a course
of Sin opposite to their former illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
and resolutions, it is impossible
to renew them by Repentance; how
much more then if those who were
truly sanctified by the holy Spirit,
should intirely lose all those graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
habits planted in them in their
Regeneration? But <hi>David,</hi> though
guilty of Adultery and Murder, Sins
of so foul a Nature as would dishonour
Paganism it self, and <hi>made the Enemies
of God to blaspheme,</hi> was restored by
Repentance. The Gospel propounds
a remedy not only for Sins committed
before Conversion, but after it. <hi>If any
Man sin, we have an Advocate with the
Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous.</hi> God
does not revoke the Adoption, nor
reverse the Justification of a Believer:
but upon scandalous disorders, a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
is not granted with respect to the
new contracted Guilt, till there be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
and actual Repentance. He is not
disinherited, but his right to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:99572:79"/>
of Heaven is eclipsed as to the
comfortable sence of it, nay suspended,
till by renovation he is qualified and
made fit for the enjoyment of that pure
Inheritance. For those Sins which
are a just cause of excommunicating
an Offender from the Church on
Earth, would exclude him from the
Kingdom of Heaven without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
Our Saviour tells us, <hi>what is
bound on Earth is ratified in Heaven.</hi>
And the Apostle expresly declares of
those kinds of Sin for which Professors
must be removed from the Communion
of Saints here, that they are an exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
bar from the Kingdom of Heaven.
<hi>But I have written to you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 11.</note> 
               <hi>not to keep
Company, if any that is called a Brother
be a Fornicator, or Covetous, or an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later,
or a Railer, or a Drunkard, or an
Extortioner: with such a one, no not to
eat. And know ye not that the Vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous

God?</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>Be not deceived: neither Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators,
nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor
Effeminate, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards,
nor Revilers, nor Extortioners, shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
the Kingdom of God.</hi> If one that
is truly a Child of God fall into any of
these Sins, till by an extraordinary
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:99572:79"/>
Repentance he is prepared for Pardon
he cannot obtain it, nor have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
hope of entring into Heaven.
For only those <hi>who are justified are glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.</hi>
Indeed it is not imaginable
where <hi>the Seed of God remains,</hi> the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
principle of Grace as it does in <hi>all
that are born of God,</hi> but that notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Sins that cannot be concealed from
the view of Conscience, will cause stings
and sorrows proportionable to their
malignity, and consequently a hatred
and forsaking of them. Now Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
principally respects the end of our
course. There may be interruptions in
the way for a time, but if with renewed
Zeal and Diligence we prosecute our
blessed End we shall not fall short of it.</p>
            <p>2. I come now to consider the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
thing propounded, The reason
why Perseverance is requisite in all that
will obtain Eternal Life, and 'tis this,
That their Sincerity may be discovered
by constancy in Obedience under all
Tryals. <hi>Blessed is the Man that endures
Temptation, for when he is tried, he shall
receive the Crown of Life, which the Lord
hath promised to them that love him.</hi> The
Law required unsinning Obedience as
the condition of Life, the Gospel accepts
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:99572:80"/>
of Sincerity, but if that be wanting, there
is no Promise that gives right to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
Now Sincerity implies such an
entire Love of God, as makes a Person
submit to all Duties commanded in his
Law, and all Trials appointed by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.
A high Example we have of this
in <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he was commanded to
offer up his only Son <hi>Isaac,</hi> and by his own
Hands, for a burnt Offering. This was to
kill a double Sacrifice at one blow, for
the Life of <hi>Abraham<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> was bound up in
<hi>Isaac:</hi> he lived in him more dearly than
in himself; all his Joy, all his Posterity
by <hi>Sarah</hi> had dyed in <hi>Isaac.</hi> What resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
what resistance of Nature did he
suffer? yet presently he addrest himself
to perform his Duty. Who ever saw a
more glorious Victory over all the tender
and powerful Passions of human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
O unexampled Obedience! be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Original without any Precedent
to imitate, and without a Copy to succeed
it. After this clear infallible Testimony
of his Sincerity, the Angel declar'd from
Heaven, <hi>Now I know that thou fearest
God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy Son,
thine only Son from me.</hi> And 'tis said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Followers of the Lamb that
<hi>they loved not their Lives unto the Death.</hi>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:99572:80"/>
The Love of Christ that animated them
in all their Sufferings, was sweeter than
Life, and stronger than Death.</p>
            <p>Indeed there was a wonderful diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in the Behaviour of the Martyrs
under Sufferings, but in all the same
Persevering Grace was evident, though
working variously. Some in the most
beautiful Flower of their Age encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
Fire and Sword, Tormentors and
Torments, with that sensible Joy, with
those Songs of Praise to Christ, as if
they saw the Heavens open with St. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi>
and their Saviour ready to receive
and crown them. But many others as
<note n="*" place="margin">Homil. 6. <hi>de laud.</hi> Paul.</note> 
               <hi>Chrysostom</hi> testifies, went to the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals,
to the Theatres, to Death, with
many Appearances of Fear. Upon
hearing the wild Beasts roar, they were
struck with horrour, at the sight of the
Executioners and the Instruments of
Torment they were pale and trembling.
The Flesh seem'd to cry out, <hi>O let this
Cup pass from me,</hi> yet weak and faint, it
followed the Spirit, that corrected the
natural desire, with <hi>not my will, but thine
be done.</hi> As the Moon in Eclipse,
though obscure, yet goes on in a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
course, as when 'tis full of Light by
the reflection of the Sun: So those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:99572:81"/>
Martyrs, though as it were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken,
and deprived of the bright
Beams of Comfort, yet persever'd in
their Profession of the Truth. When
one word to renounce Christianity
would have saved them, no Torments
could force it from them, but they pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
endured all. Now in these the
Combate of Nature was visible, and the
admirable Power of Grace. They
first overcame their own Fears, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy
of the carnal part, their Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
to what ever is desireable in the
World, which is the noblest Victory,
and then the Cruelty of their Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.
In them was verified the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Spirit, <hi>Here is the patience
of the Saints, Here are they that keep the
Command of God and the Faith of Jesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how many appear faithful while
their Faith is not to be shewed by diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
Works, and proved by Sufferings.
The Seed that fell on the stony Ground,
sprang up as hopeful as the Seed in the
good Ground at first; but when Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation
came, it wither'd away want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Root of Sincerity. And that
which was sown among Thorns, was
choakt by the Cares and Pleasures of
the World. Some Lust in the Heart
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:99572:81"/>
interweaves with the Affections and
causes Apostacy. How many from glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Beginnings have made a lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
End? not only Mercenaries in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
whose Zeal is a foraign Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
not springing from an inward
Principle of Life and Health, relinquish
even the profession of Godliness, when
their gain ceases, but some who have
thought themselves sincere, yet in times
of danger their resolutions like sick
Feathers dropt away. As the foolish
Builder that computed not the charges
of his designed Work, began to raise a
magnificent Structure, but unable to
finish it, laid the Foundation in his
own Shame. They repented their
choice of Heaven, when they saw
what it must cost them, and would save
the World with the loss of their Souls.</p>
            <p>Others that began in the Spirit, and
with raised Affections set out in the
ways of Godliness, yet by the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of sensual Lusts and Temptations,
(and therefore with greater<note n="†" place="margin">Quae justior venia in om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus causis, quam volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarius, an quam invitus peccator im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorat? Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationem quanta compellunt, ingenia carnificum, &amp; genera poena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum? Quis magis negavit, qui Christum vexatus, an qui dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatus amisit? Qui quum amitteret doluit, an qui quum amitteret lusit? <hi>Tert. de pudicit.</hi>
               </note> Guilt) leave
their first Love, and end in the Flesh.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:99572:82"/>
They fall from high Professions, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by soft Pleasures feel not the fall.
These were never sincere, and never
had a right to Heaven. They took up
sudden Resolutions, not grounded in
serious and deep Thoughts, and for a
Flash were hot and active, but with great
levity return to their former Lusts. The
Apostle tells us of such, <hi>it had been better
for them they had not known the way of
Righteousness, than to turn back and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
to forsake it.</hi> 'Tis observed that
boiling Water taken off from the Fire,
congeals more strongly than that which
was never heated: because the subtile
parts being evaporated by the Fire, the
more terrestrial parts remaining are more
capable of Cold. So those who have
felt the power of the Word in their
Affections, and afterwards lose that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
heat, become more harden'd in their
Sins. God justly withdraws his Grace,
and the evil Spirit that was expell'd for
a time returns with seven worse, and
aggravates his Tyranny.</p>
            <p>To conclude; Since the certainty of
Salvation is conditional, if we persevere
in a holy State, let us beware of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Confidence, and a vicious Dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Spirit, the trusting in our selves,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:99572:82"/>
or distrusting God. To prevent the
trusting in our selves, Consider,</p>
            <p>1. The most excellent Creatures are
by the instability of Nature liable to
defection, subject to a corruptive
change. Of this the fallen Angels are
a dreadful Example, who of their own
motion, untempted, sinned in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>2. The danger is greater of falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
when they are urged and solicited
by a violent or grateful Temptation.
Thus our first Parents fell, and lost
more Grace in an Hour, then can be
recovered by their Posterity in all Ages
to the end of the World.</p>
            <p>3. When there is supervenient Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
in the Creature, that inclines
them with earnest propensity to forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Things, and takes Flame from every
Spark, the danger is extream. Like a
besieged City that is in great hazard of
taking, by Assaults from without and
Conspiracies from within. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be very watchful over our Hearts
and Senses, and keep as much as is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
at a safe distance from Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And be very diligent in the use
of all holy means to confirm and fortify
our resolutions for Heaven. God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:99572:83"/>
to <hi>Hezekiah</hi> 15 years, but not to
preserve his Life by Miracle, he was
obliged to repair the wastings of Nature
by daily Food, and to abstain from
what was noxious and destructive to his
Body. <hi>The Apostle excites Christians, to
work out their own Salvation with fear
and trembling, for it is God that works in
them to will and to do of his good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
Let him that stands take heed lest
he fall.</hi> None are a more easy Conquest
to the Tempter then those who presume
upon their own Strength. We should
be always jealous of ourselves, from the
sad Examples of Apostacy in every
Age.<note place="margin">Denique saepe cognovimus, quoniam quem formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolosa carni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficum pompa non terruit, nec divisi la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris sulcus infregit, nec ardentes la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minae à tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphalis fortitudinis vigore abdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere potuerunt, eum inter sacra praemia constitutum, Vxor tenerae prolis oblatione, miserabilis unius lachrymae miseratione decepit.</note> St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> testifies from his own

enduring of cruel Torments for
Religion, the tearing open their Sides
that their Bowels appeared, and the
burning of some parts of their Bodies,
yet when led forth to finish the <hi>Victory
of Faith,</hi> to be a triumphant <hi>Spectacle
to Angels and Men,</hi> when the blessed
Rewarder was ready to put the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
Crown on their Heads, at the sight
of their mourning Wives and Children
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:99572:83"/>
in the way, were overcome by Pity the
weakest Affection, and fail'd in the last
act of Christian Fortitude. <hi>We must
pray to be strengthned with all Might,
according to his glorious Power, unto all
patience and long-suffering with joyfulness.</hi>
For some may vigorously resist one sort
of Temptation, and render themselves
to others. And if finally vanquisht by
one of those Enemies we lose our Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
and Crown.</p>
            <p>And as Presumption betrays the
Soul into the Devils Snares, so a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
dejection of Spirit from a distrust
of Relief from God in our Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
and his assistance with our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned
endeavours for Salvation is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
pernicious. For this damps Industry,
and causes either a total neglect, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable
use of Means for that End.
Many Christians considering their Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are weak, their Nature fickle and
apt to revolt, are ready (as <hi>David</hi> said,
<hi>One day I shall perish by the hand of Saul)</hi>
to conclude sadly of the issue of their
Condition. To encourage such let
them consider, that Perseverance is not
only a Coudition, but a Privilege of
the Covenant of Grace. For that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
supply of spiritual Strength to the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:99572:84"/>
sincere Believer for performing the
condition it requires. Indeed if Grace
were the meer product of Free Will,
the most fervent Resolutions would va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
into a Lye, upon the Assault of
an overpowering Temptation. As
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> acknowledged, that the <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syrian</hi>
Kings, had <hi>destroyed the Gods of
the Nations that were no Gods, but Idols
the work of Mens Hands.</hi> But sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Grace is the effect of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and he that <hi>begins that good work in
the Saints, will perform it until the day of
Jesus Christ.</hi> He that inclin'd them joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to chuse the Spiritual Eternal Good,
will bind their unconstant Hearts, that by
a faithful adherence they shall cleave to
their Duty and Felicity. God has most
graciously declared, <hi>I will put my Spirit
into their Hearts, that they shall never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from me.</hi> The Promise is founded
in the unchangeable Love of God to
his People. Were God as Man subject
to Variation, there might be Jealousies
in Believers lest they should lose his
good Will. As those who depend on
Princes, are suspicious lest from the
natural inconstancy of the human Will,
a new Favourite should supplant them.
<hi>But whom God loves he loves to the end.</hi>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:99572:84"/>
The Apostle prays for the <hi>Thessaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
that God would preserve them blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
till unto the coming of Christ,</hi> by this
Consideration, <hi>faithful is he that calleth
you, he will do it.</hi> He speaks of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Call, that opens the Heart and
overpowers all Resistance. As when
the Angel came with a Light shining
in the Prison to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and struck
him on the Side, bid him arise quickly
loosed his Chains, aud led him through
the Guards, open'd the Doors, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
him to Liberty. The effectual
calling of a Sinner, is the visible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
effect of electing Mercy, and
God is unchangeable in his own pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and faithful to his Promises of
bringing all such by Sanctification to
Glory. The same Apostle tells the
Saints at <hi>Corinth.</hi> That the Redeemer
would confirm them to the End: <hi>God
is faithful by whom ye are called.</hi>
Grace that was at first inspir'd, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
actuated by the Spirit, who is
<hi>stiled the earnest of the Saints Inheritance.</hi>
So that whereas the Angels that excell'd
in Strength kept not their first State of
Purity and Glory, but are sunk into
Corruption and Misery, yet true humble
Believers though weak, and encompast
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:99572:85"/>
with many Difficulties, shall be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from destructive Evil, and raised
to an unchangeable Estate of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
This is as truly admirable, as if
the Stars should fall from Heaven, and
Clods of Earth ascend and shine in the
Firmament. The Apostle who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<hi>his insufficiency of himself to think
a good Thought,</hi> yet triumphantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
<hi>I can do all things</hi> (within the
compass of his Duty) <hi>through Christ that
strengthens me.</hi> The Love, Fidelity and
Power of God are a sure Fountain of
Assistance to every Christian, that
sincerely resolves and endeavours to
prosecute his last and blessed End.</p>

The Example of the multitude is

            <p>I Shall now come to the Directions
how to fix our Choice aright.</p>
            <p>This is a matter of everlasting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
it therefore becoms us with
the most intense application of Mind to
consider it, and according to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of Wisdom, <hi>to keep the Heart with
all diligence; for out of it are the issues of
Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed the choice were not difficult
between lying Vanities and substantial
Blessedness, if uncorrupted reason had
the Superior sway: but in this lapsed
state of Nature, the Understanding and
Willare so depraved, that present things
pleasing to sence, ravish the Heart into
a Compliance. Men are deceived, not
compelled into ruin: the subtile Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
prevails by fair Temptations. This
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:99572:86"/>
will be evident by reflecting upon the
frame and composition of Man, as he
consists of Spirit Soul and Body, and
the manner of his acting. The Spirit
is the intellective discerning Faculty,
the Seat of Reason, capable to compare
and judge of the qualities of things, and
foresee their issues. The Body includes
the lower Faculties, the Sences Fancy
and Passions, that are coversant about
present things. The Soul is the Will,
the principle of Election, in the midst
of the other, as the Centre to which all
their Addresses flow. Now upon the
proposal of the spiritual and carnal
Good in order to Choice, the Will is
to be directed by the Mind, and by its
own Authority to rule the lower Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
But alas! the Mind has lost its
primitive Light and Purity, Vigilance
and Integrity, neglects its Duty, and
from Ignorance, Errour and carnal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
often pleads for the Flesh: and
the Will, the rational Appetite, is vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
subordinate and inslaved by the
Sensitive. From hence it is that in the
competition, Heaven with all its Glory
is despised, and the present World em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd.
To open this more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Consider.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:99572:86"/>
1. The Sences can only taste and
enjoy grosser dreggy Pleasures.</p>
            <p>2. The Fancy that depends upon
them in its Operations, and is guided
by their report, conceives of Felicity
only under the notion of sensitive Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
We may illustrate this by the
practice of<note n="‖" place="margin">Flagitio insigni, sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per alicujus foeminae amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re flagrans &amp; ob id Deas pingens sub dilectarum imagine.

               </note> 
               <hi>Aretius</hi> a Painter recorded
with Infamy, who being often imployed
to Paint the Goddesses to be set in the
Pagan Temples, always drew their
Pictures by the Faces and Complexions
of his Harlots, that the Objects of his
impure Love might have Veneration
and a Divinity attributed to them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Titles, and Pretence of <hi>Minerva,
Juno, Diana,</hi> and the other Goddesses
ador'd by the Heathens. This Impiety
in an Idolater is resembled by Men, who
fancy Happiness, (that is a spiritual
divine Perfection enjoyed in the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Vision of God) to be a carnal
Fruition, and having with sensible
Colours and Lineaments represented it
agreeable to their brutish Faculties,
place it in their Hearts, and Sacrifice
all their Thoughts Affections, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to it.</p>
            <p>The Fancy is very powerful in Men
upon a double account.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:99572:87"/>
1. The Understanding naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
the notions of things by Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasms
that are still mixing in its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations.
While the Soul is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to a Tabernacle of Flesh, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
no Object without the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
excitation of the Senses. From
whence it is impossible, that a Person
absolutely deprived of Sight from his
Birth, should have an Idea of Light or
Colours, or that is born deaf, should
conceive what Sound is, the Sense ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
having imparted an account of it
to them. And the Image of the Object
is not immediately transmitted from the
Sense to the Mind, but first to the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
that prepares it for its view.
And from hence the sensual Fancy is so
predominant in sweying the Judgment,
and inclining the Will. As those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors
of state that have the Ear of the
Prince, and are continually with him,
by specious Informations, and disguising
Truth, influence him to approve or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
Persons and Things according to
the various Aspects given by them. The
same Object propounded in a dark con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
manner, weakly moves us, but
varnisht and beautified with lively and
pleasant Colours by the Imagsnation,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:99572:87"/>
is armed with such Power that ravishes
the esteem of the Mind, and consent of
the Will. Now Celestial Happiness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
purely Spiritual, <hi>such as Eye hath
not seen, nor Ear heard, nor entered into
the Heart of Man to conceive,</hi> though
some discoveries be made of it by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
yet the Imagination makes
such an obscure detracting Idea of it,
that it affects no more, than a dead sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
drawn in some imperfect Lines of
an exquisite Beauty: but when the
Fancy is warned and enlivened by the
presence of sensible Objects, it makes a
vigorous impression of them upon the
Mind, and that represents the Pictures
of Pleasure as very lovely and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the Will, which presently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
them.</p>
            <p>2. The Fancy has a marvellous force
upon the sensitive Appetite, that eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
desires what is represented as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
though the enlightned Mind sees
through the Temptation, and knows
'tis a meer Dream that brings neither
solid nor durable Joy. One in a Feaver
is pleased by imagining Fountains and
Streams though he knows that imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Waters cannot quench his Thirst,
nor afford the least real Refreshment.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:99572:88"/>
Now the sensitive Appetite being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd
by the Fancy, imparts a contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Fire to the Will, and that induces
the Mind, either to concur with it, and
palliate the deceit, and to judge favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
according to its Inclinations, or
makes it slack or remiss in its Office,
diverting the Thoughts from what
might controul the Appetite, or if the
Understanding still contradicts yet 'tis in
so cold and speculative a manner, <hi>that the
Law of the Members</hi> rebels against the
Superior Light, and is too strong <hi>for the
Law of the Mind,</hi> and that Saying is
verified,
<q>Video meliora probó<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> Deteriora
sequor.</q>
I see what is worthy to be chosen, but
pursue what is to be abhorr'd. Thus
miserably weak are the rational guiding
Powers in Man since his Fall, thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious
and violent the brutish Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.
In short, illusion and concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence
are the principal causes why the
most noble and divine Good is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued
and rejected in comparison of
inferior transitory Vanities. O the
cheap Damnation of beguiled Souls!
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:99572:88"/>
A Mess of Pottage was more valuable
to <hi>Esau,</hi> than the Birth-right that had
annext to it the Regal and Priestly Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
Unwise and unhappy Wretches!
<hi>that follow lying Vanities, and forsake their
own Mercies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have briefly set down the
process of mens foolish choice in this
degenerate state. Now that we may
with a free uncorrupted Judgment
compare things in order to a wise choice
of true Felicity, it follows from what
has been said, that as the Apostle in
obeying his Heavenly Commission,
<hi>conferr'd not with Flesh and Blood;</hi> We
must not in this matter of infinite im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
attend</p>
            <p>1. To the suggestions and desires of
the Senses and carnal Appetite, which
are the worst Councellors, as being
uncapable of judging what is our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Happiness, deceitful and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
            <p>First, They are uncapable of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
Spiritual Eternal Things,
which alone bring fit and compleat sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to the Soul: and cannot look
forward to the end of sinful Pleasures,
and ballance the terrible Evils they
leave at parting, with the slight vanish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:99572:89"/>
content that springs from their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
Therefore as blind Persons lay
hold on things they feel, so the sensitive
Faculties adhere to gross present enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not understanding the pure
spotless Felicity that is to come, and
despising what they do not understand.
Now who would in an Affair upon
which his All depends, advise with
Children and Fools, whose Judgment
of things is without Counsel, their
Counsel without Discourse, their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
without Reason? There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more contrary to the order of
Nature, than for Men that should af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
with Judgment, to judg by their
Affections.</p>
            <p>2. The carnal Appetite with its
Lusts are very deceitful, a Party within
holding correspondence with our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Enemies, the Armies of evil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
so active and assiduous in conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and accomplishing the Damnation
of Men. The Devil in Scripture is
called the Tempter by way of eminence,
who manages and improves all Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and his pernicious design is by
the Objects of Sense ordered and made
more alluring and killing by his various
Arts, to engage the Affections into a
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:99572:89"/>
compliance and so to gain the Will.
Now our great danger is not so much
from Satan the Enemy without, as from
the carnal Appetite, the Traitor within,
that gives him the first and easy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the Soul. He can only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
by representing what is amiable to
Sense, but the corrupt Appetite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
to the closing with it. He temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Jesus Christ but was repell'd with
shame, <hi>having found nothing within him
to work upon.</hi> The perfect regularity of
Faculties in our Blessed Saviour was not
in the least disorder'd neither by his fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Insinuations, or most furious Assaults.
And we might preserve our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
inviolable notwithstanding all his
Attempts, did not some corrupt Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
cherish'd in our Bosoms lay us
naked and open to his poison'd Darts.
The Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> who had a Spiritual
Eye, and discern'd wherein the strength
of our great Enemy lies, admonishes
Christians, <hi>Dearly Beloved I beseech you,
as Strangers and Pilgrims, abstain from
fleshly Lusts, that war against the Soul.</hi>
And we are told by him, That <hi>the
Corruption that is in the World, is
through Lust.</hi> The outward Objects are
useful and beneficial in their kind, the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:99572:90"/>
abuse of them is from Lust. The Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is not in the Flower, but in the
Spider. 'Tis therefore infinitely dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to consult, or trust our carnal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
in this matter, for they are
brib'd and corrupted, and will commend
temporal things to our choice.</p>
            <p>3. The sensual Affections are so nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
and clamorous, so vehement and
hasty, that if they are admitted to
counsel and give the decisive Vote, the
Voice of Conscience will not be heard
or regarded. In concernments of a
lower Nature, 'tis constantly seen,
that nothing more disturbs Reason, and
makes Men improvident and pecipitant
in their Determinations, than a disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
Passion. From hence, 'tis a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Rule, That as 'tis not fit to eat in
the heigth of a Fever, because the Meat
feeds the Disease, by increasing the
feaverish not the vital heat: so 'tis not
good to deliberate in the heat of any
Affection. For then the Thoughts
strongly blow up the Passion, and
smother Reason, and the Mind is rather
a Party than a Judge: but after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
of that Feaver in the Soul, in
a quiet enterval, 'tis seasonable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider.
Now if any simple Passion when
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:99572:90"/>
moved, transports and confounds the
Mind, and makes it uncapable of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aright, much more the love of the
World, an universal Passion that reigns
in Men, and has so many swarming de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
answerable to the variety of sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
things, and therefore is more unru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
lasting and dangerous then any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Passion. In short, sensual Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
captivate the Mind, and hinder
its due considering the folly and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of the carnal choice, and when
incenst (as distracted Persons whose
Strength grows with their Fury) vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
break all the restraints the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
can apply from reason and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</p>
            <p>2. In order to make a right choice,
we must be very watchful lest the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Example of Men taint our Reason,
and cause an immoderate esteem of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
things. <hi>The whole World lies in
Wickedness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> in a sensual Sty, without
Conscience of its Misery, or care of
regaining its Happiness, deceived and
pleased with shews of Felicity. The
way to Hell is broad as the inclinations
of the licentious Appetite, pleasant as
the delights of Sense, so plain and easy
that Men go to it<note n="*" place="margin">Bion.</note> blindfold, and so
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:99572:91"/>
frequented that it would force Tears
from any considering Person, to see Men
so hasty to meet with Damnation.
When <hi>Calisto</hi> the Harlot reproacht
<hi>Socrates</hi> that there were more followers
of her Beauty than his Wisdom, the
<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Aelian. <hi>l.</hi> 13. <hi>c.</hi> 32.</note> Philosopher replied, that was not
strange, because it was much easier to
draw them in the way of Pleasure, that
is steep and slippery, than to constrain
them to ascend to Virtue, seated on a
Hill, where the ascent is slow, and with
toil and difficulty. Now there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more contagious than Example.
We blindly consent with the Multitude,
and are possest with foolish Wonder,
and carnal admiring of worldly Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Treasures and Delights, neglecting
to make a due estimation of things.
'Tis the ordinary Artifice of the Devil
to render temporal things more valuable
and attractive to particular Persons,
from the common practice of Men who
greedily pursue them as their Happiness.
As some crafty Merchants, by false re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
raise the exchange, to advance
the price of their own Wares. The
Men of the World are under the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Sense, and think them only to
be wise and happy that shine in Pomp,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:99572:91"/>
abound in Riches, and overflow in
Pleasures. The Psalmist tells us of the
prosperous Worldling, <hi>that while he lives,
he blesses his Soul; and Men will praise thee
when thou dost well to thy self.</hi> By vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
imitation our Judgments are more
corrupted, and our Passions rais'd to
higher degrees for painted Vanities.
The Affections in the pursuit of earthly
things are inflam'd by the contention
of others. And when holy Desires
and Resolutions spring up in Men, yet
so powerful is the custom of the World,
that they often become ineffectual.
As a Ship whose Sails are fill'd with a
fair Wind, but makes no way, stopt by
the force of the Current. Now to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
us against the pernicious influence
of Example, Consider,</p>
            <p>1. 'Tis most unreasonable in this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
of so vast moment to be under the
direction of the Multitude. For the
most are sottish and sensual, govern'd
by the uncertain motions of a giddy vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble
Fancy, and roving impetuous
Passions, so that to be led by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
and disregard the solid immortal
rules of heavenly Wisdom, is as perfect
madness as for one to follow a herd of
Swine through the Mire, and leave a
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:99572:92"/>
clean Path that lies before him. If
there were but few in an Age or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
that were deluded with false Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances,
it would be a disgrace to
imitate the practice of the Foolish: and
shall the great numbers of the Earthly-minded
give Reputation and Credit to
their Error. He were a strange Fool
indeed, that should refuse a single piece
of counterfeit Money, and receive a
great heap in payment, as if the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
added a real value to them. 'Tis
therefore a necessary point of Wisdom
to devest all<note n="†" place="margin">Nunquam de vita judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catur, semper creditur, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabimur, si modò separe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur à coetu. <hi>Sen.</hi> de <hi>vit. Beat.</hi>
               </note> vulgar Prejudices, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
our selves from the Multitude,
that we may see the vanity of things
that dazle inferior Minds.</p>
            <p>2. Consider the universal judgment
even of the worldly Men in their last
and serious Hours, when the Prospect
of Eternal Things is open before them.
How vastly different are their Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of temporal Things in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view,
from what they were in their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Desires? How often do they
break forth in the sorrowful Words of
the Apostle, <hi>We have been toiling all
Night and caught nothing?</hi> When there
are but a few remaining Sands in the
Glass of Time, and Death shakes the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:99572:92"/>
Glass before them, how powerfully do
they preach of the emptiness and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of things below, and sigh out in
<hi>Solomon</hi>'s phrase, <hi>All is Vanity?</hi> And
this is more singularly observable in
those who have had the fullest enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of earthly things. How do they
complain of the vain World, and their
vainer Hearts, when Experience has
convinc'd them of their woful Folly?
<hi>Solomon</hi> who was among other Princes,
as the Sun in the midst of the Planets,
that obscures them by his illustrious
Brightness, He that had surveyed this
Continent of Vanity, to make an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
whether any satisfaction could
be found in it, at last sadly declares,
that all things here below are but seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
kinds and ranks of Vanities, as inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
to make Men happy, as coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
Jewels of several Colours are to
enrich the Possessor. Nay they are not
only Vanity, but Vexation, an empty
show that has nothing real, but the
vexation of disappointment. And shall
we not value the judgment of Men
when they are best instructed, and give
credit to their Testimony when they
are sincere? Certainly in their Approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
to the Divine Judgment they are
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:99572:93"/>
most considerate and serious, they have
the truest and justest thoughts of Things,
and most freely declare them. O the
astonishing Folly of Men! the will not
be convinc'd of the error of their ways,
till they come to the end of them, and
the Sun is set, and no time remains for
their returning into the way of Life.</p>

            <p>3. Humble and ardent Prayer to
God, that he would turn away our
Eyes and Hearts from Vanity, to the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
durable Good.</p>
            <p>First, The sound and stedfast belief
of Eternal Things is requisite to direct
our choice aright.<note place="margin">Heb. 11. <gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> 
               <hi>Faith is the substance
of things hoped for, the evidence of things
not seen.</hi> It assures us of their reality
and worth as if they were before our
Eyes, and in our actual Possession.
This Divine Light governs and conducts
the Will to choose wisely, and excites
all the practick Powers for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the greatest Evils, and the obtaining
perfect Felicity. When the Devil, the
deadly Flatterer, by inviting represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of the World intices the Heart,
the serious belief of the future reward
so glorious and eternal, disgraces the
most splendid Temptations, and makes
them ineffectual. <hi>This is the Victory that
overcomes the World, even our Faith.</hi> If
tempted to Lasciviousness by the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of an earthly Beauty, Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
the angelical lustre of the Saints,
when they shall come with the unspotted
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:99572:94"/>
Lamb in his glorious appearance, and
this unbinds the Charm, and makes the
tempting Person an object not of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
but Aversation. If tempted with
Honour to a sinful compliance, Faith
represents so convincingly the Glory
which all those who preserve their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
and Integrity inviolable, shall
receive at the universal Judgment, in
the presence of God, and the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
(as our Saviour has promis'd, <hi>He
that serves me, him will my Father honour</hi>)
and the confusion wherein the most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Sinners shall then be cover'd,
that with a generous disdain all secular
honours will be despised. And it is as
powerful to enervate the Temptation
of temporal Profit. We read of <hi>Moses,
that by Faith, when he was come to Years,</hi>
(and therefore more capable to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
and enjoy what Felicity the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Honours and greatest Riches could
afford) <hi>refused to be called the Son of</hi>
Pharaoh'<hi>s Daughter; chusing rather to
suffer Affliction with the People of God,
than to enjoy the Pleasures of Sin for a
season; esteeming the reproach of Christ
greater Riches than the Treasures of</hi> Egypt:
<hi>for he had respect to the recompence of
Reward.</hi> And all the Evils which a
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:99572:94"/>
wicked World, inspir'd with rage from
Satan, can threaten to fright us from
our Duty, Poverty, Disgrace, Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nay Torments and Death, those
<hi>terribles visu formae,</hi> so heightned by the
carnal Fancy, are easily overcome by a
sincere and strong Believer. Thus some
who were urged by such motives to
renounce their Religion, told the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors,
that Life was not sweet to them
if they might not live Christians, nor
Death bitter if they must die for Christ.
A lively firm persuasion of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and eternity of the Reward,<note place="margin">Nec vereamu occidi, quos constat, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do occidim<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">

               </note> what
miraculous effects would it produce?
Nothing would be impossible within
the compass of our Duty, either to do
or suffer in order to a glorious Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.
Faith has a celestial Power, a
magnetick Virtue to draw up the Heart
from the Earth, and fastens it to things
above. It is not imaginable that a clear
sighted Soul, that sees a Good infinitely
great, should reject it for mean things
to please the lower Desires. We may
as probably imagine, that a skilful Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eller
would part with the richest Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental
Pearls, for Cherry Stones to play
with Children.</p>
            <p>From hence we may discover the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:99572:95"/>
true cause of the neglect of the great
Salvation offered in the Gospel, <hi>the Word
preached does not profit, not being mixt
with Faith in them that hear it.</hi> It is
astonishing to consider that Earth should
contend with Heaven for our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and prevail against it; that Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
should turn the Scale against the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
and eternal weight of Glory;</hi> that
Men should pursue fleeting Shadows,
and neglect the most excellent Realities,
as if they could be happy here, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
for ever, and hereafter there were
neither Happiness nor Eternity. But
this releases the wonder, that <hi>all Men
have not Faith.</hi> Eternal Things are not
of conspicuous moment in the carnal
Ballance. Some are Infidels in Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
openly declaring themselves to be
without Religion, without God, and
have the same credit of the Heaven
and Hell discovered in the Gospel, as
of the <hi>Elysian Fields,</hi> and <hi>Stygian Lake,</hi>
the Fables of the Poets. These live as
if they should never die, and die as if
they should never live in the other
World, as if Death caused so deep a
sleep, that the Voice of the Son of God
could not awaken them at the last day.
Their unbelief is not from reason, but
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:99572:95"/>
vicious opposite Affections; for the
truth of the Eternal State is so clearly
revealed, and strongly establisht in the
Gospel, that the sincere Mind must
readily assent to it. But the Wicked
cannot delight in the discovery of that
for which they are unprepared, and
therefore try all ways to elude the force
of the most satisfying Arguments. They
do not fear Hell, but are afraid they
should be fearful of it. This is such a
piece of Folly as that of the <hi>West Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
who at the first Invasion by the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> were so terrified with the
glittering of their Swords that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
fled, and very advisedly resolved
to hide themselves in the day, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
their Enemies in the night. They
were fearful to see their Danger, and
rash to encounter it, and fighting in the
dark were killed in the dark. The
Threatnings of Eternal Death are the
brandishings of God's glittering Sword
before he strikes, and sensual Infidels are
afraid lest the belief of those terrible
Truths should enter into their Breasts;
therefore are utterly careless of what
may convince them of their danger,
and will not foresee what they shall
certainly suffer. This is obstinate, and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:99572:96"/>
the most incurable Infidelity. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
whereof we have in the <hi>Pharisees,</hi>
who rejected our Saviour. Though
all the Characters of the <hi>Messiah</hi> were
conspicuous in his Person, though his
Doctrines were confirmed by Miracles,
yet they would not yeild up themselves
to that omnipotent conviction, so strong
were their carnal prejudices against his
humble State, and holy Doctrines.
That reproach is more justly due to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels
under the Gospel, than to <hi>Israel</hi>
in the Prophet: <hi>Who is blind as my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant?</hi>
The Heathens who are blind
from their Birth, and have only some
glimmering apprehensions that Eternity
succeeds Time, are less culpable than
those who have infinitely more reason
to believe it, and yet believe it less.
The Plea for them will be a terrible Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation
against such Unbelievers. If
a blind Person falls, it moves compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
but if one voluntarily shuts his
Eyes against the Sun, and refuses the
direction of the Light, and falls from a
Precipice, his Ruin is the just conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of his Folly. Simple Ignorance
excuses as to the degrees of the Fault,
but affected wilful Ignorance, now
Reason and Revelation with united
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:99572:96"/>
Beams give so clear a prospect into the
Eternal World, aggravates the Guilt,
and Sentence of such Unbelievers. 'Tis in
vain to offer Arguments to convince
them; for they are as deaf as Adders to
the wisest Instructions, till Sense extort
a belief from them. They have hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
their Hearts and Faces against all
Reproofs, and by an open contempt of
Scripture-Threatnings, are past reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
There are many degrees of Sins,
many steps in the descent to Hell, but
the lowest and nearest the Gates of that
infernal Prison, is the scornful derision
of God's terrible preparations for the
Wicked hereafter.</p>
            <p>Besides, the most who are Believers in
Title, are Infidels in Heart. Our Saviour
tells the <hi>Jews,</hi> who pretended the highest
Veneration to the Writings of <hi>Moses,
That if they had believed Moses, they would
have believed him; for Moses wrote of him.</hi> If
Men did seriously believe such an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Reward, as the Gospel propounds,
would it be a cold unpersuasive motive
to them? The depravation of the Will
argues a correspondent defect in the
Mind, though not absolute total Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
yet such a weakness and wavering
in the Assent, that when Temptations
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:99572:97"/>
are present and urgent, and it comes to
actual choice, Sense prevails over Faith.
This will be clear by Universal Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in temporal things. The probable
hope of Gain, will make those who are
greedy of Gold, prodigal of their Lives,
and venture through tempestuous Seas
to accomplish their Desires. And if the
belief were equal, would not Men do
or suffer as much for obtaining what is
infinitely more valuable? A firm Assent
would produce adherence, and Faith in
the Promises, Fidelity in obeying the
Commands of Christ. <hi>Tertullian</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prounds
it as a powerful incentive to
the Martyrs, <hi>Quis ergo non libentissimè
tantum pro vero habeat erogare, quantum
alii pro falso?</hi> Who would not joyfully
sacrifice Life and all it sindearments, to
obtain true Blessedness, which others do
for the vain Appearance of it? On the
contrary, the fear of a present destructive
Evil will controul the most eager Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites.
'Tis recorded that when the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of <hi>Israel</hi> were in pursuit of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listins,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 14. 24, 25, 26.</note>
               <hi>Saul</hi> to compleat his Victory,
forbad upon pain of Death that any
should taste Food till the Sun was down.
In the chase of their Enemies, they past
through a Wood abounding with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:99572:97"/>
yet notwithstanding their Hunger
and Faintness, and the easy Provision
before them, no Man so much as tasted
it; <hi>for the People feared the King's Oath.</hi>
And did Men truly believe and fear the
Law of God threatning Hell for Sin,
would they dare to commit it, though
invited by pleasant Temptations? Nay
not only a strong fear, but the meer
suspicion of great danger will restrain
the most vehement desires of Nature.
What Person though inflamed with
Thirst, would drink a Glass of cool Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
if he suspected that deadly Poison
were mixt with it? And if Men were
persuaded that Sin is attended with
Death, would they <hi>drink in Iniquity
like Water?</hi> The Devils themselves are
not able to conquer the Fear <hi>of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to come, they believe and tremble.</hi>
Therefore when it is not active upon
the Conscience, it is either because Men
do not believe the thing it self, or that
Holiness is necessary to prepare for it.
Indeed even in true Believers the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of Eternal Things has such great
allays, that temporal things are over-va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
and over-feared. A strong Faith
in the Truth and Power of God, would
make the glorious World so sure and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:99572:98"/>
near in our Thoughts, that with indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Affections we should receive
good or evil things here, <hi>rejoice as if we
rejoiced not, and mourn as if we mourned
not.</hi> Our Lives would be so regular
and pure, as if the Judg were to come
the next hour, as if the Sun did now
begin to be darkned, and the Trumpet
of the Arch-angel were sounding, and
the noise of the dissolving World were
universally heard. Infidelity deads the
Impression, and suppresses the reigning
Power of Eternal Things in our Hearts.
In short, Men are heavenly or earthly in
their Choice and Conversation, as they
are directed by the sincere Light of Faith,
or misled by the false beams of Sense.</p>

            <head type="sub">Consideration is requisite in order to a wise
Choice. How it must be managed that
it may be effectual. It must be serious,
frequent, and with application to the
Soul. Motives to it. The true Causes
why Carnal Men are averse from

            <p>THE second thing requisite in order
to a wise Choice is Consideration.
For as by Faith the virtue of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is diffused through all the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and the Powers of the World to
come are felt in the Soul; so, by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
Faith is exercised and becomes
effectual. This unites and reinforces
the beams of Eternal Truth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames
the Affections. As the Psalmist
expresses himself, <hi>My Heart was hot
within me while I was musing, the Fire
burned.</hi> Heaven is a Felicity so glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and attractive, that if duly conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
no Man can possibly refuse it: and
Hell is a Misery so extream and fearful,
that if seriously laid to Heart, none can
possibly choose it. The last End is to
be conceived under the notion of an
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:99572:99"/>
infinite Good, without the least mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Evil, to which the human Will
has a natural tendency. The liberty of
indifference is with respect to some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
good Things, which may be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
represented, so as to cause incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
or aversion. That Men who
believe Eternal Life is the Reward of
Holiness, yet with a careless inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
pass over their Duty; and that
Eternal Death is the Wages of Sin, yet
securely continue in it, is more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
than to see Martyrs sing in the
Flames, and the great cause of it is the
neglect of Consideration. This is assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be the cause of that unnatural and
astonishing Rebellion of <hi>Israel</hi> against
God their Father and Soveraign:<note place="margin">Isa. 1. 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>Hear
O Heavens, and give Ear O Earth, for
the Lord hath spoken, I have nourished and
brought up Children and they have rebelled
against me. The Ox knows his Owner,
and the Ass his Masters Crib, but Israel
doth not know, my People doth not
consider.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Duty as it is of admirable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
so 'tis universally necessary:
for all are equally concern'd, and it is
within the power of all to perform.
Though Men cannot convert themselves,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:99572:99"/>
yet they may consider what is prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
to Conversion. For the Will may
turn the Thoughts of the Mind to any
sort of Objects.</p>
            <p>I will briefly shew the nature of this
Duty, and how to manage it for spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
profit, and those Objects from
whence our Thoughts derive vigour for
the swaying of the Will and the conduct
of the Life.</p>
            <p>1. The nature of Consideration is
discovered by its end, which is this; that
the Mind being satisfied in the just Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
upon which the choice of Heaven
is to be made, the Will and Affections
may be ingaged in an earnest joyful
and constant pursuit of it. And in this
respect it differs from simple Knowledg,
and naked Speculation, that informs
the Mind without influence and efficacy
upon the Heart. Like a Garland of
Flowers that adorns the Head without
any benefit and refreshing to him that
wears it. And practical meditation
differs from the study of divine things in
order to the instructing of others. That
is like a Merchant's buying of Wine for
Sale, this like providing it for our own
use.</p>
            <p>2. That the Consideration of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:99572:100"/>
Things may be effectual, it must be,</p>
            <p>1. Serious and deliberate. For the
Affair is great in reality above all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
conception or comparison. All
other things, how considerable soever in
themselves, yet respectively and in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
with this, are of no account. Our
Saviour told <hi>Martha, One thing is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary:
Mary hath chosen the better part,
that shall not be taken from her.</hi> What
Instance can be of equal moment with
that of entertaining the Son of God?
yet a serious attention to the Words of
Eternal Life dropping from his Lips,
was more necessary than making Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
for him. The greatest and most
weighty Affairs in the World are but a
vain Employment, but irregularity and
impertinence, in compare with Eternal
Salvation. And the greatest solemnity
of Thoughts is requisite, to undeceive
the Mind, and ingage the Will for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
'Tis very observable that Errors
in Judgment and Choice spring from
the same causes, the not sincere and due
weighing of Things. In the decisions
of Questions, Truth is discovered by
comparing, with an equal staid Attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the Reasons of the one and the other
part: but when some vicious Affection
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:99572:100"/>
contradicts the Truth, it fills the Mind
with Prejudices, that it cannot impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
search into things, and is deceived
with specious fallacies, with the image
of Truth. For according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
application of the Mind 'tis deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
and Passion strongly applies it
to consider that which is for the carnal
Interest, and consequently Inclination,
not Reason, is the principle of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion.
And this is more evident in
Mens foolish Choice. As the Eye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see but what is visible, nor the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
conceive what is not Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible,
the Will cannot love and chuse
what is not amiable at least in shew. If
the Devil did appear without a disguise,
he would have no power to persuade,
but in all his Temptations there is the
mixture of a Lie to make it pleasant.
He presents a false Perspective, to make
what is but superficial appear solid and
substantial. And the carnal Heart turns
the Thoughts to what is grateful, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
seriously considering what is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
better, and accordingly chuses by
the Eye of Sense, the Happiness of this
World. Therefore till Eternal Things
are open'd in the view of Conscience,
and the Mind calmly considers by the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:99572:101"/>
Light of Faith their reality and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
no right valuation, nor wise choice
can be made.</p>
            <p>Besides, the most clear and rational
enforcements by the actings of the
Thoughts, are necessary to make a
strong impression on the Affections, and
rescue them from the captivity of the
Flesh. In other things as soon as the Mind
is inlightned, the Will resolves, and the
inferior Faculties obey; but such is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of the carnal Heart, that although
'tis evident from infallible Principles
there is an everlasting Glory, infinitely to
be prefer'd above the little appearances
of Beauty and Pleasure here, yet the
most piercing reasons enter heavily with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
earnest inculcation. Slight or sudden
Thoughts may produce vanishing Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of complacence, or distaste, and
fickle resolutions, that like sick Feathers
drop away, and leave the Soul naked to
the next Temptation; but solemn and
fixed Thoughts are powerful on the
Heart, in making a thorow and lasting
Change. When the Clouds dissolve in
a gentle Shower, the Earth drinks in all,
and is made Fruitful; but a few sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Drops, or a short storm of Rain,
that wets only the Surface, without
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:99572:101"/>
sinking to the Root, is little beneficial.
In short, there may be some excitations
to Good, and retractions from Evil,
some imperfect faint essays towards
Heaven, from an impulse on the Mind;
but solid Conversion is produc'd by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate
Discourse, by the due conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and estimation of things, 'tis ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
and perpetual.</p>
            <p>2. Consideration must be frequent
to keep eternal Objects present, and
powerful upon us. Such is the natural
Levity and Inconstancy, Sloth and
Carnality of the Mind, That the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Heavenly Things quickly pass
through, but of Earthly abide there.
If a Stone be thrown upwards, it remains
no longer in the Air, than the impression
of the force by which it was thrown
continues; but if it falls on the Earth, it
rests there by Nature. When the Soul
is raised in contemplation to Heaven,
how apt is it to fall from that heighth,
and lose the esteem, the lively Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
and Affections of Eternal
Things? But when the Thoughts are
excited by the presence of what is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to Sense, the withdrawing the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
does not deface the Idea of it in
the Memory, nor lessen the Conceit,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:99572:102"/>
nor cool the Desires of it, because the
Heart is naturally inclined to it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'tis necessary every day to refresh
and renew the conceptions of eternal
Things, that although they are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in act, yet the efficacy may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
felt in the Heart and Life. The
Soul habituated to such Thoughts will
not easily yield to Temptations, that
surprise and overcome others that are
Strangers in their Minds to the other
World: Nay the presence of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as by <hi>Antiperistasis,</hi> will reinforce
the Resolutions for Heaven; like the
powring Water upon Lime, that revives
a hidden Fire in it, which seems a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Miracle. 'Tis therefore of great
advantage frequently to sequester our selves
from the World, to redeem Time
from secular Affairs, for the recollecting
of our Thoughts and their solemn exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
upon the Eternal World. Sense
that reveals natural things, darkens spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.
How can the Thoughts be fixt
on invisible things so distant from Sense,
if always conversant with secular Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
that draw them down? In the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the Night a small Voice is more
distinctly heard, and a little distant
Light more clearly seen: so when the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:99572:102"/>
Soul is withdrawn from the noisy
throng of the World, and outward
things are darkned, the Voice of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
is better heard, and the Light
of Heaven more perfectly received.</p>
            <p>3. Consideration of Eternal Things
must be with present Application to the
Soul. 'Tis not the meer conviction of
the Mind, but the decree of the Will
that turns Men from Sin to Holiness,
from the Creatures to God. The Heart
is very deceitful, and by variety of
shifts and palliations is disposed to irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions
and delays in spiritual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments.
How often does the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Sinner contend with himself, and
while Conscience urges him to seek the
Kingdom of Heaven, and the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
draw down to the Earth, the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
part prevailing over the rational,
he overcomes, and is overcome, he is
convinced and condemned by his own
Mind. Till Consideration issues in this,
that with setled Judgment and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
the Soul determines for God and
Heaven, 'tis without profit. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the managing this Duty, 'tis our
Wisdom not to be curious and inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
after subtile Conceptions, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
Notions of the future State, that
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:99572:103"/>
little confer to the making the Heart
better, but to think seriously on what
is plain and evident, and most useful to
produce a present lasting Change. It
were egregious Folly in a Man, that for
the use of his Garden should with great
labour fetch Water from distant Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and neglect that which springs up
in his own Ground. That Meditation
is profitable which produces not new
Thoughts, but holy and firm resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of obeying God in order to the full
enjoying of him for ever.</p>
            <p>To persuade us to the serious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of this Duty, there are many en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements.</p>
            <p>Is any Man so foolish, so regardless
of his convenience, to purchase a House
wherein he must live all his Days, and
will not first see whether it will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
and secure for his Habitation?
Shall we not then consider Heaven the
Mansion of Blessedness, and Hell the
Seat of Misery and Horror? for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as we chuse here, we shall be in
the one or other place for ever. I shall
in a particular Chapter endeavour to
represent something of the inexpressible
Misery of the Wicked hereafter, and
shew how congruous and powerful the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:99572:103"/>
Thoughts of it are to restrain Men from
Sin, but at present shall briefly excite
to the Meditation of the Heavenly Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as the most noble, delightful and
fruitful work of the Soul, whiles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
to the Body of Flesh. 'Tis the
most exalted exercise of the Mind, the
purest converse with God, the Flower
of consecrated Reason. 'Tis most like
the Life of glorified Spirits above, who
are in continual contemplation of the
Divine Excellencies, and 'tis most rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
above the Life of carnal Men, that
are sunk into sensuality and brutishness.
'Tis the most joyful Life, in that it
sheds abroad in the Soul delights that
neither satiate, nor corrupt, nor weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
the Faculties, as the delights of Sense
do, but afford perfection as well as
pleasure. 'Tis the most profitable Life.
As in those parts of the Earth where the
beams of the Sun are strongly reflected,
precious Metals and Jewels are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd,
wherein the refulgent resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of that bright Planet appears: so
the lively and vigorous exercise of the
Thoughts upon the heavenly Glory,
will produce Heavenly Affections, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Discourses, and a heavenly shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Conversation. This will make us
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:99572:104"/>
live like the blessed Society above, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
their Innocence and Purity, their
joyful, entire and constant Obedience
to God. This confirms the holy Soul
in its Choice, with an invincible effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
against the Temptations and Lusts of
the World. The serious considering
Believer is filled with ravishing Wonder
of the Glory that shall be revealed, and
looks down with Contempt upon the
Earth, and all that has the Name of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
here. All the Invitations, nay
Terrors of the World, are as unable to
check his pursuit of his blessed End, as
the Breath of an Infant to stop the high
flight of an Eagle.</p>
            <p>But how rare and disused a Duty is
this? How hardly are Men induc'd to set
about it? Business and Pleasures are pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
Diversions. Some pretend Business
as a just cause, but in vain; <hi>for the one
thing necessary</hi> challenges our principal
Thoughts and Care. Besides, there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals
of Leisure, and the Thoughts are
always streaming, and often run waste,
which directed aright, would be very
fruitful to the Soul. The true cause of
this neglect is from the inward temper of
Men. Carnal Pleasures alienate the
Mind, and make it unfit for the deep
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:99572:104"/>
serious actings of the Thoughts upon
Eternal Things. <hi>I have said of Laughter,
thou art mad,</hi> it makes the Mind light and
vain and desultory. As a distracted Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
by every motion of Fancy flys from
one thing to another without coherence.
The Heart fill'd with cloudy Cares,
and smoaky Fires, with Thoughts and
Desires about worldly Things, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepar'd
for such a clear, calm and sedate
Work. A Carnal Person can taste no
sweetness, feel no relish in the Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Heaven, nor any spiritual Duty.
'Tis as if one should take some delicious
Fruit into his Mouth, a Peach or the
like, without breaking the Skin; it
would be rather a trouble, than pleasant.
Nay the Gospel expresly declaring, <hi>that
without Holiness no Man shall see God;</hi>
those who by vicious Affections are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in any sinful way, being conscious
of their guilt and unpreparedness, and
that while such, they are under a peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
exclusion from celestial Glory, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
endure the thoughts of Heaven. The
Divine Presence is their Torment, and
the serious Consideration of it, is to bring
them before God's holy and just Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
to accuse and condemn them.</p>

The End of Man's Creation considered.
The Things of the World and Heaven

            <p>I Shall next proceed to a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
view of those Objects, from
whence Consideration derives vigour,
for the inclining of the Will to a
right Choice, and for regulating the
Life.</p>
            <p>1. Consider the End for which Man
was designed in his Creation, why en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with rational and noble Powers
of Soul, and plac'd by the Soveraign
Maker in the highest rank of so nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and various Natures that fill the
Universe. Is it to raise an Estate, to
shine in Pomp, to enjoy sensual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
for a little while, and after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
term to be no more for ever? Was
he sent into the World upon as mean a
Business as that of the foolish Emperor,
who employed an Army, furnish'd with
all Military Preparations, to gather
Shells upon the Sea-shore? This were,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:99572:105"/>
according to the passionate expostula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Psalmist, to charge God <hi>that
he had made all Men in vain.</hi> Reason
and Scripture tells us the End of Man is
to glorify and enjoy God, the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whereof makes him perfectly happy,
and the missing of it perfectly misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
This is a fundamental Truth, upon
which the whole Fabrick of Mans Duty
and Felicity is built. Without this
Foundation, our Faith presently sinks.
If the clearness of this principle be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scur'd,
we shall wander from the way of
Eternal Life, and not only lose the
way, but the remembrance and desire
of it. Thinking is the property of the
reasonable Soul, and the just order of
Consideration is, that the Mind primari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
regards this supream directive Truth
that is to govern all our Actions. 'Twas
prudent Counsel that<note n="*" place="margin">Primum e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go scriptoris officium exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimo, ut titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum suum le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat, atque identidem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terroget se, quid caeperit scribere.</note> one of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
gave for composing a Book, that
the Author frequently reflect upon the
Title, that it may correspond in all the
parts with his original Design. Thus
it becomes a Man often to consider the
End of his Being, that the course of his
Life may have a direct tendency to it;
and the more excellent our End is, the
more constraining is the necessity to
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:99572:106"/>
prosecute it. 'Tis of great Efficacy to
reflect upon our selves, Whither do my
Thoughts and Desires tend? for what
do I spend my Strength and consume
my Days? Will it be my last Account
how much by my Prudence and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
I have exceeded others in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
acquisitions? If a General were
at play while the Armies are engaging,
would it be a noble Exploit for him to
win the Game, whiles his Army for
want of conduct loses the Victory?
Will it be profitable for a Man to gain
the World, and lose his Soul? Let
Conscience answer in Truth.</p>
            <p>'Tis observable what is reported of
a<note n="†" place="margin">Cum nata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis dies Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruarii ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monuisset ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randae, &amp; tricesimo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perissem, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasit me subi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta moestitia, &amp; perculsit admirantem, quomodo sine sensu vitae ad ejus culmen pervenissem, à quo lux quaelibet fit obscurior, &amp; dies nostri ad occasum inclinare inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piunt.

               </note> noble Forreigner, that reflecting
upon his Birth-day, and the Age of his
Life, he was surpriz'd with grief, and
struck with Astonishment, that without
a due Sence of the proper Business and
End of Life, he was arrived to that Age,
when our Days begin to decline. In
an instant all things seem'd to change
appearance in his view. Then first (says
he) I perceived I was a Man, for before
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:99572:106"/>
I had not resolved for what I should
employ my Life. The issue was, his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Resolution unfeignedly to honour
God, sincerely to confess Christ, to
place his Felicity in Holiness of Life, and
most zealously to follow it. Let any
one that is not of a reprobate Mind,
and an incorrigibly depraved Heart,
duly consider the sublime and superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
End of Man. O what a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
change will it make in him, of
Carnal into Spiritual? nay it would be
a kind of Miracle if he continued in his
sinful State. How will it transform him
into another Man, with new Valuations,
new Affections and Resolutions, as if
he were <hi>born again</hi> with a new Soul?
How will it amaze him that his whole
course has been a contradiction to the
wise and gracious design of God, that
all his Industry has been a race out of
the way, a perpetual diversion from
his main Business, that his Life has been
fruitless and dead to the true End of it?
How will he be confounded at his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Folly? Then alone we act with
Understanding, when mov'd by our
blessed End, and our Actions by a strict
tendency without variation issue into
it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:99572:107"/>
2. Consider attentively the Objects
that stand in competition for our
Choice, the present World and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
to make a judicious comparison
between them in their Quality and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>First, in their Quality. The things
of the World, according to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God himself, who is only Wise
and Good, and has the highest Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to decide in the case, are but fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious
appearances of Happiness, meer
Vanity. And certainly the Creator
knows the true worth of all things, and
would not disparage his own Works,
but would undeceive Men that are apt
to judge and choose by the Eye of
Sense. The Apostle tells us, <hi>that an Idol
is nothing in the World;</hi> although the
matter of it may be of Gold, or Marble,
or Wood, yet it has no divine Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
which the Idolater attributes to
it. So all worldly things, in which Men
place their chief Care and Confidence
and Joy, though they have some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Goodness, and are a transient
relief to us in our passage to Eternity,
yet they are nothing as to perfect Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.
'Tis meerly Opinion and Conceit
that makes them so valued and pleasing,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:99572:107"/>
like a rich Dye to a slight Stuff from
whence its price arises. Reason is either
obscur'd, or not obeyed, when the
World is the Object of our Choice.
Now what are these appearances of
Beauty and Pleasure compar'd with a
Blessedness that is truly infinite? Carnal
Joy smiles in the Countenance, flatters
the Fancy, touches the Sense, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
fill the Heart, but the Favour of
God satisfies the Soul. <hi>Thou hast put
Gladness into my Heart, more than when
their Corn and Wine increased.</hi> Carnal
Joy in its highest elevation in the time
of the Harvest and Vintage, is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
less than Spiritual Joy that
springs from the Light of God's Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
The World cannot fill the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
capacity of our Senses, but divine
Joys exceed our most inlarged compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
Faculties. <hi>The Eye is not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with seeing, nor the Ear with hearing;
but the Peace of God passes all Vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
The Things of the World are of
a limited Goodness, Wisdom is not
Strength, nor Learning Riches, nor
Beauty Fruitfulness: But God is a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Good, in whom are all attractives
to raise and satisfy our Desires. If Men
did consider, they would distinguish
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:99572:108"/>
and despise in comparison all that is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Felicity here, with the Favour of
God. To seek for satisfaction in the
Creature and forsake him, is as if one
desirous to see the Light should with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
from the presence of the Sun, to
borrow it from a weak Ray reflected by
some obscure matter. Now if there be
so vast a difference in their Nature, as
between a painted Vapour, and the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
glorious Good, between Finite and
Infinite, why is there not a difference
accordingly in our Esteem, Affections
and Respects to them? How unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
is it that a Soul capable of God,
should cleave to the Dust? It would be
most egregious Folly to hang a Weight,
that is able to turn a great Engine, upon
a small Clock: 'tis incomparably more
Foolish, when the love of Happiness,
the Weight of Human Nature, which
applied aright, will turn our Desires to
Heaven, is only used to give vigorous
motion to our endeavours about earthly
things.</p>
            <p>2. Consider their Duration. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
tells us that the main <hi>scope of his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
was things invisible;</hi> and gives the
reason of it, <hi>for the things that are seen
are Temporal, and the things that are not
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:99572:108"/>
seen are Eternal.</hi> To insist upon the
vast difference between temporal and
eternal may seem needless: for the first
notions of things are of such uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable
Clearness, that an attempt to
prove them, is to light a Candle to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the Sun. Yet this principle
drawing after it such powerful Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
for the government of our
Hearts and Lives, and Conscience being
so remiss, and the sensual Affections so
rebellious, 'tis needful to consider this
seriously, that what is really assented
to in Speculation, may not be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
in Practice. Now who can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
the infinite volume of Ages in Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?
the Understanding of an Angel
can no more comprehend what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible
than the Mind of a Man.
A Snail will pass over an immense space
as soon as an Eagle: for though one
dispatches more way than the other, yet
both are equally distant from arriving
to the end of what is endless. But that
the conception of Eternity may be more
distinct, and affecting, it is useful to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
it under some temporal resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances,
that sensibly though not fully
express it. Suppose that the vast Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
were distilled drop by drop, but so
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:99572:109"/>
slowly that a thousand years should pass
between every drop, how many Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of years were required to empty it?
Suppose this great World in its full
compass from one Pole to another,
and from the top of the Firmanent to
the bottom, were to be fill'd with the
smallest Sand, but so slowly that every
thousand years only a single Grain
should be added, how many Millions
would pass away before it were filled?
If the immense Superficies of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
wherein are innumerable Starrs,
the least of which equals the magnitude
of the Earth, were filled with Figures
of Numbers without the least vacant
space, and every Figure signified a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
what created Mind could tell their
Number, much less their Value? Having
these Thoughts, I reply; the Sea will
be emptied drop by drop, the Universe
fill'd grain by grain, the Numbers
written in the Heavens will come to an
end, and how much of Eternity is then
spent? Nothing; for still infinitely more
remains. In short, what ever is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
extend the continuance of it
to the utmost possibility of concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is infinitely short of Eternity.
A Day, an Hour, a Minute, has some
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:99572:109"/>
proportion with a thousand years; for
that duration is determined by a certain
number of Days, and Hours, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes:
but Millions of Ages have no
proportion to Eternity, because 'tis an
indeterminable Duration. The Mind
is soon tir'd and lost in searching after
numbers to represent it: 'tis confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and struck with amazing Horror,
and can only direct the Eye upward or
downward to the two Habitations of
Eternity, the glorious and the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
Heaven and Hell. Now let us
compare the Things of the present
World with those of the future State.
The first are measur'd by flying Time,
the other remain in an unmoveable
Eternity. The Comforts that spring
from the Earth, suddenly wither and
fall to it: the Tree of Life flourishes
only above. Frequent changes from
Prosperity to Adversity are the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of this mortal State. As those who
are in Voyages at Sea, sometimes are in
a calm and presently suffer a storm, and
are forc'd to alter their course by the
changing of the Winds. So 'tis with us
in our passage here; but upon the first
entrance into another World, all the
variations of this are at an end. <hi>Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:99572:110"/>
every Man at his best estate is altogether
Vanity. Surely every Man walks in a
vain shew, surely they are disquieted in vain.</hi>
The visible Felicity of Man is of no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance.
We may frequently observe
in the Evening, a Cloud by the refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Sun invested with so bright
a Lustre, and adorn'd with such a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
variety of Colours, that in the
judgment of our Eyes, if an Angel were
to assume a Body correspondent to his
Glory, it were a fit matter for it. But
in walking a few Steps, the Sun is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
beneath the Horizon, and the
Light withdrawn, and of all that splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
flaming appearance, nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
but a dark Vapour, that falls
down in a Showre. Thus vanishing is
the shew of Felicity here. In this, Sense
assists Faith; for the Experience of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day verifies what the Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
<hi>that the fashion of this World passes
away.</hi> And therefore the guilty folly
of Men is aggravated, <hi>to set their Eyes
and Hearts upon that which is not.</hi> To
see one passionately dote on a Face
ruin'd and deform'd with Age, to be
inchanted without a Charm, raises won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and exposes to contempt. Yet such
is the stupidity of Men to embrace with
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:99572:110"/>
their most entire Affections the withred
Vanities of the World, that are hasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their period. 'Twas a stinging
reproach to Idolaters from God, <hi>None
considers in his Heart, neither is their
Knowledg nor Vnderstanding,</hi> to say,
<hi>I have burnt part of it in the Fire, yea I
have also baked Bread upon the Coals there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
I have roasted Flesh and eaten it, and
shall I make the residue an Abomination;
shall I fall down to the stock of a Tree?</hi>
And are not sensual Men equally guilty
of such monstrous Folly? for though
universal Experience convince them,
that all things under the Sun are fading,
and that many times their dearest Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
are snatcht away from their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces,
yet who does advisedly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and say to himself, shall I give my
Heart to transient Shadows? shall I
cherish vain hopes, vain aims and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
of obtaining Happiness in a perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
World? Although the worshipping
a Stock be Idolatry of grosser Infamy,
yet 'tis as foolish and as destructive to
set our chief Love and Joy, that is only
due to God, upon the Creature. And
what follows in the Prophet is justly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
to such Persons; <hi>He feedeth on
Ashes</hi> (that not only afford no nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:99572:111"/>
but is very hurtful to the Body)
<hi>a deceived Heart has turn'd him aside,
that he cannot deliver his Soul, nor say, is
there not a Lye in my right Hand?</hi> Thus
carnal Men are so blinded with their
Affections to these short liv'd Pleasures,
that they cannot take the true liberty of
judging and reflecting that they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and delighted with empty Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
that will suddenly end in disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
and sorrow? Briefly, these
glittering Fictions and false Joys cannot
please without an error in the Mind,
that shall last but a little while. And
if you saw a distracted Person Sing and
Dance, with a conceit that he is a Prince,
would you be willing to lose sober
Reason for his phantastick Pleasure, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
if you knew that his chearful
fit should suddenly change into a
mournful or raging Madness for ever?
But the Blessedness above is unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
as God the Author and Object of
it, Eternal as the Soul that enjoys it.
And shall the <hi>World that passes away with
the Lusts thereof, turn our Affections
from the undefiled immortal Inheritance?</hi>
Shall the vanishing appearance, the
fleeting Figure of Happiness be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
before what is substantial and dure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able?
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:99572:111"/>
Astonishing Madness! that God
and Heaven should be despised for pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Trifles. If a spark of true Reason,
of sincere Love to our Souls be left, <hi>we
shall count all things but dross and dung, that
we may gain the Kingdom of Glory.</hi> Thus
Eternity inlightens, thus it counsels us.</p>

         <div n="11" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. XI.</head>
            <head type="sub">Other Motives propounded. God desires the
Eternal Happiness of Men. All that
unfeignedly seek it, shall enjoy it. The
terms are gracious and easy upon which
'tis offered to Men.</head>
            <p>TO excite us further to seek the
Kingdom of Heaven, I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
other Motives to Consideration.</p>
            <p>1. God is very willing that Men
should be saved and partake of
his Glory. For this end, <hi>he has brought
Life and Immortality to light in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</hi>
The Lord Jesus, the Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
has dispel'd the darkness of
the Gentiles, and the shadows of the
Jews, and rendred the blessed and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
State so clear and so visible, that every
Eye may see it. Our assurance of it is
upon infallible Principles. And though
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:99572:112"/>
the excellent Glory of it is inexpres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
yet 'tis represented under variety
of fair and lovely Types to invite our
Affections. Besides, God makes an earnest
offer of Life to us in his Word, he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
Counsels, Excites, Urges, nay
Intreats and Beseeches with infinite Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,
that Men will accept of it.
Thus the Apostle declares, <hi>Now then
we are Embassadors for Christ, as though
God did beseech you by us, we pray you in
Christ's stead be reconciled to God.</hi> Is it
not evident then beyond the most jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
suspicion, God is desirous of our
Happiness? Can we imagine any design
any insincerity in his Words? Why
should Heaven court a Worm? 'Tis his
love to Souls that expresses it self in that
condescending compassionate manner,
to melt and overcome the perverse and
hardned in Sin.</p>
            <p>And as his Words so his Works are a
convincing Argument of his Will: His
most gracious sustaining and supporting
of sinful Men, his innumerable Benefits
conferr'd upon them, in the provision
of Good, and preservation from Evil,
are for this End, that by the conduct
of his merciful Providence they may be
led to Repentance, and received to
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:99572:112"/>
Grace. And the temporal Judgments
inflicted on Sinners, are medecinal in
their Nature, and in his design to bring
them to a sight and abhorrence of Sin,
to prevent their final ruin: if they prove
mortal to any, 'tis from their obstinate
Corruption. The time allowed to those
who are obnoxious to his Justice every
hour, is not a meer reprieve from Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but a space of Repentance to sue
out a Pardon: They are spared in order
to Salvation.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 9.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord is long-suffering
to usward, not willing that any should pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
but that all should come to Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But above all his other Works, the
giving of his Son to be a Sacrifice for
Sin, is an incomparable demonstration,
how much he delights in the Salvation
of Men. Since God has been at such
cost to put them into a capacity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Kingdom of unchangeable
Glory, far transcending the earthly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise
that was forfeited by Sin, we
have the strongest assurance that he
desires their Felicity. And how guilty
and miserable will those Sinners be that
when Christ has opened Heaven to us
by his Blood, refuse to enter into it.
When <hi>Brutus</hi> propounded to a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
his design to restore <hi>Rome</hi> to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:99572:113"/>
he replied, That the action would
be glorious indeed, but that so many
servile Spirits that tamely stoopt under
Tyranny, were not worthy that a Man
of Vertue and Courage should hazard
himself to recover that for them, which
they did so lightly esteem. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of Mankind is without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy
the most glorious work of God,
wherein the concurrence and concord
of his Attributes appear in that excellent
manner, that only his miraculous Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
could find out. But how asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
is the unworthiness of Men,
who wretchedly neglect Salvation,
which the Son of God purchased by a
Life full of Sorrows, and a Death of
infinite Sufferings? Blessed Redeemer!
may it be spoken with the humble affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate
and thankful sence of thy dying
Love, why didst thou give thy self a
ransom for those who are charm'd with
their Misery, and with the most foul
Ingratitude disvalue so precious a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption?
How justly shall they be
for ever deprived of it? <hi>Behold, ye dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisers,
and wonder, and perish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Consider, this glorious Blessedness
shall be the Portion of all that unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
choose it, and earnestly seek it.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:99572:113"/>
This motive was inclosed in the first,
but deserves a separate Consideration.
And of this we have infallible assurance
from the Word of God, <hi>who cannot lye.
Godliness has the Promise of the Life
to come. This is a faithful saying, and
worthy of all acceptation.</hi> The hope
of a Christian is so certain that 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
to <hi>an Anchor fastned in Heaven.</hi>
And besides the Fidelity of his Word,
God has given us Security of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
the Life of his Son. This me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
should turn the Current of our
Desires and Endeavours to Heaven. For
notwithstanding all our toil and sweat,
the labour of the Day and the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Night for the obtaining
earthly things, yet we many times fall
short of our aims and hopes. 'Twas
the observation of the wisest Man, <hi>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
and saw under the Sun, that the
Race is not to the Swift, nor the Battel to
the Strong, neither yet Bread to the Wise,
nor yet Riches to Men of Vnderstanding,
nor yet Favour to Men of Skill; but Time
and Chance happeneth to all.</hi> Indeed
such is the order of Divine Providence
in the World, there must be different
conditions of Men here, some Rich, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Poor, some Noble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> others Mean,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:99572:114"/>
some in Command others in Subjection.
And from hence it is also evident, that
neither Dignity nor Riches nor Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
are the Happiness of Man. For
'tis not becoming the Wisdom and
Goodness of God to make that the last
end of the reasonable Creature, which
though sought with Sincerity and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
may not be obtained, or of
which without his own consent he may
be deprived. But civil distinctions and
qualities are of no value and considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with respect to the obtaining or
excluding from Heaven. The rich and
honourable that are in an exalted State,
have not a more easy ascent and entrance
into the Kingdom of God than those
who are in the lowest degree. The
Starrs appear with the same bigness to
him that stands in the deepest Valley as
on the highest Hill. Is there any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the Souls of the rich
and great in the World, and the Souls
of the poor and despised? are they not
equally the Off-spring of God, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
ransomed by the most precious
Blood of his Son? are they not equally
capable of Eternal Rewards? are not
the Promises of the heavenly Kingdom,
equally addrest to every one that has
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:99572:114"/>
an immortal Soul, that is faithful to his
Duty and Covenant with God. This
should inspire all with flaming Desires,
and draw forth their utmost Industry,
<hi>and make them stedfast and unmoveable,
always to abound in the Work of the Lord,
knowing our labour shall not be in vain in
the Lord.</hi> I know the carnal Will is
impetuous and impatient of delay; and
earnest for what is present with the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect
of the future Glory. But the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonableness
of this is evident to all,
for 'tis not a new and strange thing to
sow in hopes of reaping a Harvest, for
Men to be industrious and active on
Land and Sea for future Advantage.
Nay 'tis the constant practice of the
World: The Merchant, the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
the Student, the Souldier, and
every Man in the circle of his Calling
are visible instances of this; and though
many times the most flourishing hopes
are blasted, they are not discouraged.
And is it not a sight full of wonder to
observe Men chearful in Labours and
Hardships in the Service of the World,
to carry it so lightly as if they had
Wings, and all for a poor and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Recompence, and to be slow and
languid in their endeavours for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:99572:115"/>
as great and as sure as God is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and true? How many ambitious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
strive to please a Prince, and wait
long in his Service, who is but a Man,
and therefore variable in his Temper
and State, sometimes is not willing to
do what he can, and sometimes cannot
do what he would to reward his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants?
and is there not infinitely more
reason we should labour to please God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
who is the most liberal, and rich,
and <hi>certain Rewarder of all that seek
him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Consider, How gracious the terms
are upon which Heaven is promised in
the Gospel, Our Saviour's Laws are so
holy, just, and in their own Nature so
good to Men, even in their present per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,
that their own excellence
and equity and sweetness is sufficient to
recommend them without a respect to
the glorious Reward of Obedience.
For what can be more desireable than
conformity to the Nature of the blessed
God? What Pleasure is comparable to
that which springs from a pure Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
from a godly righteous and sober
Conversation? How joyful is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of that Service which more
immediately is directed to the honour
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:99572:115"/>
of the Divine Majesty? in Prayer and
other sacred actions we draw near to
the Fountain of Felicity, and receive
from his fulness. In the affectionate
Praises of God we are Companions of
the Angels. And is not Integrity and
Honesty in our dealings with Men more
easy and comfortable than Fraud and
Oppression? Is it not troublesome to
be always under a Mask, to use arts and
disguises to avoid the reproach and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
that attends unjust actions when
discovered? Are Temperance and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity
as hurtful to the Body, as Luxury
and Lasciviousness the essential parts of
carnal Felicity? How miserably distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
is Man when the Heart is rent with
numberless Vanities, the Affections di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
between various Objects! how
quiet and composed, when the Heart is
united to God as the supream Good,
and the Affections joyfully conspire in
his Service! Can it then be pretended
that the Yoke of Christ is heavy, and
his Law hard? Or are his Promises un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
and his Reward small? No,
<hi>his Commands are not grievous; in the
keeping them there is a great Reward,</hi> a
present Paradise. Religion will make
us happy hereafter in the enjoyment of
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:99572:116"/>
God, and happy here in Obedience to
his Holy Will. Such is his Goodness
that our Duty and Happiness are the
same.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it will be said, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
requires</hi> us to pluck out the right Eye,
and to cut off the right Hand, and to take
up the Cross of Christ, that is, to mortify the
dearest Lusts, and to submit to the sharpest
Sufferings for his Honour that we may be
eternally Happy. <hi>To this I answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, the human Nature in this
depraved State, only relishes such Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
as pleasantly insinuate with the
carnal Senses, and 'tis bitter as Death to
bind up the Affections from them. But
Grace gives a <hi>new divine Nature to the
Soul,</hi> and makes it easy to abstain from
fleshly Lusts. To make this more clear by
a sensible Instance: Suppose a diseased
Person whose Stomach is opprest with
corrupt Humours, and his Throat and
Mouth so heated with Choller and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Thirst, that he thinks it impossible,
though for his Life, to abstain from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
Drinking. If a Physician by
some powerful Medicine cleanses the
Stomach, and tempers the internal heat,
he then can easily restrain himself from
Excess. Thus a carnal Man that is full
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:99572:116"/>
of false Estimations, and irregular Desires,
while there are Pleasures without, and
Passions unsubdued within, though his
Salvation depends on it, thinks it impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to restrain the exorbitant Appetites
of Flesh and Blood. The <hi>Gentiles thought
it strange, Christians did not run with
them to the same excess of Riot.</hi> But
Divine Grace so clarifies and inlightens
the Mind, so purifies and elevates the
Affections, that 'tis not only possible
but easy to abstain from unlawful Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.
St. <hi>Austin</hi> before his Conversion
was astonisht that many in the vigour
of Youth, and in a frail World lived
Chastly; and reflecting upon himself,
was encouraged by this Thought, that
which such and such observe, why shall
it be impossible to me to observe? and
upon serious trial, by the prosperous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of Heaven, was a Conqueror o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all carnal Temptations. Nay after
his holy Change,<note place="margin">Quam suave carere: suavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatibus istis?</note> the withholding his
Heart from vitious Delights, was inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressibly
more sweet than his former
enjoying of them. And are there not
many visible examples of holy heavenly
Christians, to whom grosser sensual
Pleasures are unsavory and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?
You may as well tell the number
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:99572:117"/>
of the Stars, as of those who have pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
Religion in its strictness and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and by their enlightned Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations
directed us in the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
And are their Bodies taken from
the Vein of a Rock, and not composed
of Flesh and Blood as well as others?
Are their Passions, like <hi>Solomon</hi>'s brazen
Sea, unmoveable by any Winds of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations?
Are they entirely exempted from
the impression of Objects, and the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Affections? No, they are alive, and
sensible of those things that ravish the
Affections of carnal Men, but by the
power of Grace despise and overcome
them. And this Grace is offered in the
Gospel to all that sincerely desire it, so
that 'tis a vain wretched pretence that
Religion binds to hard Service.</p>
            <p>To the other part of the Objection,
that sometimes Religion exposes the
Professors of it to heavy Sufferings. I
answer, Indeed the Gospel is plain and
peremptory in this, if we will <hi>reign with
Christ, we must suffer with him,</hi> when we
are called forth to give a noble testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to his Truth. 'Tis no extraordinary
Elevation, no point of Perfection, but
the duty of every Christian to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ready in the disposition and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:99572:117"/>
of his Mind, and by actual Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom
to sacrifice his Life, when the
honour of Christ requires it. But 'tis
no hard condition to suffer transient
Afflictions for the obtaining a Happy
Immortality, to be conformable to the
Image of our suffering Redeemer, that
we may be crowned with his Glory.
How many Christians esteemed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
honoured in the Disgrace, and
blessed in the Injuries they suffered for
Christ, and with an invincible Patience,
and astonishing Joy, endured the most
cruel Persecutions, though yet the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Nature in them was as tender and
sensible of Pains as in others: but the
natural aversion and repugnance to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
was overruled by the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the rational Will, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their Duty, and the Reward
attending it. They gave a most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
sensible Testimony how much
more valuable Heaven is than this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
World, willingly exposing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to all Evil here, <hi>and rejoycing in
hope</hi> of a glorious issue.</p>
            <p>In short, the Reward of Obedience
is a triumphal Crown; and where there
is no Victory there can be no Triumph;
and where no Combate no Victory;
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:99572:118"/>
and where no Enemy, no Combate.
Therefore we are commanded to fight
against our internal Enemies, our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Affections, to kill the Lusts of the
Flesh, and to encounter and overcome
by Humility and meek Submissions the
cruelty of malicious Enemies without
us, in a direct order of obtaining the
Crown of Life. And a Believer that
has Heaven in taste and expectation,
will easily renounce the most pleasant,
and willingly endure the sharpest
Temptations, for the blessed Reward of
his Obedience.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XII.</head>
            <head type="sub">The Gospel threatens Hell to all that prefer
the Pleasures of Sin before Heaven.
How congruous and powerful a Motive
this is to work on carnal Men. The
Misery of an everlasting Hell repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented.</head>
            <p>4. COnsider, if Men choose the
Pleasures of Sin that are but
for a season, before Heaven, that infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exceeds this World, then an everlasting
Hell shall be their Portion. There is no
middle State in the next World, no to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
mediocrity, but two contrary
States, yet alike in this, that the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
and Misery are equally Infinite
and Eternal. And by the most wise
righteous Will of God, there is an inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
connexion between the Choice
and Actions of Men here, and their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Condition for ever. The equity
of this cannot be denied without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
the Light of Reason. For
when by a Chain of Consequences sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Pleasures are linked with eternal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
threatned in the Divine Law,
he that will enjoy those forbidden Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:99572:119"/>
binds himself to suffer all the
pains annexed to them. And 'tis just
that those who err without Excuse,
should repent without Remedy. Now
the threatning of eternal Punishment is
the most proper Argument to work on
carnal secure Sinners.</p>
            <p>1. Because they are more capable to
conceive of the Torments of Hell, than
the Joys of Heaven. Storms and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
are more easily drawn by a Pencil,
than a calm bright Day. Fire and
Brimstone are very painful to Sense, and
the imagination strongly represents its
vehemence in tormenting the Body, and
what an evil the uncessant remorse of
the guilty Conscience will be hereafter,
is in part understood by the secret ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations
and twinges of self-condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Sinners here: but they are abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
Strangers to the Joys of the Holy
Ghost, the Delights of the Soul in the
Contemplation and Love of God, the
peace and contentment of Conseience
in his Favour. They cannot without
Experience know how good the Lord
is, no <hi>more than see a taste.</hi> To dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to them of the Spiritual Pleasures
that flow from the divine Presence, of
the Happiness of the Saints <hi>that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:99572:119"/>
the Throne of God, and serve him
Day and Night in his Temple,</hi> is to speak
with the Tongue of an Angel unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible
things.<note place="margin">Si frigido lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quar nescit quod loquor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Aug.</hi>
               </note> Their Affections and
Minds and Language are confined to
sensible things. <hi>The natural Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
not the things of the Spirits of God,
for they are foolishness to him, neither can
he know them, because they are spiritually
discerned.</hi> There may be in a carnal
Person a conception of Heaven as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
from Miseries, and some smother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
confused thoughts of its Felicity, as
the Idea of Light and Colours in one
Blind from his Birth; but only the pure
in Heart <hi>can see God,</hi> as in the perfect
Vision of Glory in Heaven, so in the
imperfect reflection of it in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</p>
            <p>2. Carnal Men are more disposed to
be wrought upon by representing the
Torments of Hell, than the Joys of
Heaven. For we cannot love but what
is known, nor enjoy but what is loved.
And as the purification of the Heart
from vicious Affections, is the best
means to clear the Mind, so the illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Mind is very influential to
warn the Heart. The true concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Heaven in its amiable Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:99572:120"/>
would convey such a sweetness as
to change Hatred it self into Love; and
of this only prepared Souls are capable.
But those who are sunk into Sense are
without relish of spiritual Felicity, and
are either allured or terrified only with
that is pleasant or painful to Sense.</p>
            <p>'Tis recorded as the unparallel'd Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of <hi>Nero,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Identidem dictitans, qualis arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fex pereo. <hi>Suet.</hi>
               </note> that when he was ready to
cut his own Throat to avoid the fury of
the Multitude, he broke forth into great
expressions of Sorrow what an excellent
Artist he died. 'Twas not the loss of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire that so much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
him, as that so much skill in Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
died with him. He valued himself
more as a Fidler than an Emperor.
Thus carnal Men with a folly infinitely
more prodigious, when Death is near,
are not so much affected with the loss
of the Crown of Glory, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven, as with their leaving
the present World and its Vanities. This
makes Death intolerably bitter. Till
the Love of God inflames and purifies
the Heart, the fruition of his Glory is
not esteemed nor desired. A Seraphim
sent from the Presence of God with a
flaming Coal from the Altar, toucht
the Lips of the Holy Prophet, and his
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:99572:120"/>
Heart was presently melted into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with the Divine Will. But if
a Rebel Angel, that burns with another
Fire than of Divine Love, were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht
from Hell, with a Coal from that
Altar, where so many Victims are offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to divine Justice as there are damned
Souls, and touch'd obdurate unreformed
Sinners, that they might have a lively
sence what it is to burn for ever; this
were the most congruous and effectual
way to reclaim them. Like stubborn
Metals they are only made pliant by
the Fire.</p>
            <p>Indeed the fear of Hell though raised
to the highest degrees, is not sufficient
to convert a Sinner thorowly to God.
For that Religion that is the meer effect
of Fear, will be according to the nature
of its Principle, with resistance and
trouble, wavering and inconstant when
the violence of the fear is lessen'd.
Whereas that which is from the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Love and the hope of a desired
Good, is fully voluntary and perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.
As a Scholar that applies himself
to Learning by the constraint of Fear,
his Study is uneasy, and whilst he is
reading, his Fancy transports him to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, and when his task is finisht,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:99572:121"/>
he presently runs to Play. But a Lover
of Learning with Diligence and Delight
is intent in his Studies, and though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in other Affairs, yet his Thoughts
are still conversant about Learning. In
short, the fear of Hell may be only a
natural Affection, that recoils from what
is tormenting to the Body, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with the Love of Sin; but the
hope of Heaven as 'tis revealed in the
Scripture, is a spiritual Affection, and
always joined with the hatred of Sin.</p>
            <p>Now the great design of the Gospel
is by the fear of Hell, as a powerful
preparative,<note place="margin">Nisi timore incipiat homo Deum colere, non perveniet ad amorem. <hi>Aug.</hi>
               </note> to make way for the love
of Heaven. If carnal indulgent Sinners
are not roused by a quick apprehension
of Hell, they will securely enjoy their
pernicious Pleasures, and grow old in
Sin, and at last die impenitent. No of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
of Mercy will prevail, till they are
storm'd by the Terrors of the Lord. But
when the fear of eternal Misery has
made a breach, divine Grace victorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enters and takes Possession. The
convinced and contrite Sinner most
humbly and willingly embraces the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Promises, wherein not only Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and Indemnity is offered, but the
richest favour, the advancing him into
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:99572:121"/>
a State of Eternal Glory. Thus the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Hopes succeed tormenting Fears,
and the Obedience which before had a
mixture of involuntary flows from the
intire consent of the Soul, with filial
Freedom.</p>
            <p>Before the particular Description of
the pains of the Damned, I shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
in General, That the full repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
of Hell is beyond all human
Expression, nay our most fearful
Thoughts cannot equal the Horror of
it.<note place="margin">Psal. 90. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Who knows the Power of thine An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger?</hi>
What are the prepared Plagues
by infinite Justice and Almighty Wrath
for obstinate Sinners? It is impossible
for the most guilty and trembling Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
to inlarge its sad apprehensions
according to the degrees of that Misery.
<hi>The Lord will shew forth his Wrath,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 22.</note> 
               <hi>and
make his Power known in the Vessels fitted
for Destruction.</hi> None can tell what God
can do, and what Man shall suffer, when
made capable to endure such Torments
for ever, as now would presently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
him. As the Glory of Heaven cannot
be fully understood till enjoyed, so the
Torments of Hell cannot be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
till felt. But we may have some disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of those unknown Terrors, by the
following Considerations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:99572:122"/>
1. The Wisdom of God requires that
the Punishment threatned in his Law,
as it must so be firmly decreed, that all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
Rebels shall of necessity undergo
it, so it must incomparably exceed all
temporal Evils, to which Men may be
exposed for their Obedience to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Commands. Otherwise the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
would not be an effectual restraint
from Sin. For the propinquity of an
Evil makes a strange impression on the
Mind, and present Fear makes a Person
sollicitous to avoid the incursion of a
danger ready to seize on him, without
forecasting to prevent an evil look'd on
at a distance. Therefore that the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the divine Law may preserve
the Precepts inviolable, that there may
be a continual reverence of it, and a
fixed resolution in the Heart of Men not
to transgress, the penaly threatned must
be in its own nature so terrible, that
the fear of it may conquer the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of all present Evils, that can be
inflicted to force us to Sin. As on the
other side, to confirm our purpose to
please God in all things, the Reward
of Obedience must be of infallible assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
that all and only those who serve
him faithfully shall enjoy in the future
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:99572:122"/>
State, and so excellent, that all the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements
of the World, may in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
with it, be of no consideration to
divert us from our Duty. They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the Heart, and have its most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
Respects, from whom is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
the most desireable Good, and
feared the most terrible Evils. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Saviour warns his Disciples,
<hi>Fear not them that can kill the Body,</hi>
(make that part die that is mortal) <hi>but
fear him that after he has killed, has power
to cast into Hell, yea I say unto you, fear
him.</hi> All the exquisite Tortures, that
the most cruel contriving and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
malice of wicked Men can inflict, is
so much less than the Wrath to come,
that avoid the one and venture on the
other, is more brutish Stupidity, than
that of the Horse or Mule, that starts at
the shadow of a Bush, and springs over
a Precipice.</p>
            <p>2. The Judgments of God executed
here, are light and tolerable in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
of the punishment of Sinners in
the next Life. 1. Temporal Evils of all
kinds and degrees, as Pestilence, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
War, are designed for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Men to a sight and sence of their
Sins, and are common to Good and Bad
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:99572:123"/>
here. And if his anger be so terrible
when he chastises as a compassionate
Father, what is his fury when he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes
as a severe Judg? If the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
Remedies ordered by his Wisdom
and Love for the conversion of Sinners
be so sharp, what is the deadly revenge
of his irreconcileable Hatred?</p>
            <p>2. The Miseries of the present State
are allayed with some enjoyments. None
are so universally afflicted, so desolate,
but something remains to sweeten the
sence of their Sufferings. Judgments
are tempered with Mercies. No Man
is tortur'd with all Diseases, nor forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of all Friends, nor utterly without
Comfort. And when the Affliction is
irremediable, yet if our grief produces
Sympathy in others, 'tis some ease to
the troubled Mind, and by that assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
the Burthen is made lighter. But
in Hell the Damned are surrounded with
Terrors, encompast with Flames, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any thing to refresh their Sorrows,
not a drop of Water to a Lake of Fire.
All that was esteemed Felicity here, is
totally withdrawn. Death puts a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
to their Lives, and the Pleasures of
Sin for ever. For 'tis most just, that those
Objects which were abused by their
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:99572:123"/>
Lusts, and alienated their Hearts from
their Duty and Felicity, should be taken
away. And which is extream Misery, in
their most pitiful State they are abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
unpitied. Pity is the cheap and
universal Lenitive, not denied to the most
guilty in their Sufferings here: for the
Law of Nature instructs us to pity the
Man, when the Malefactor suffers. But
even this is not afforded to the Damned.
All their Agonies and Crys cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
the Compassion of God, and the
blessed Spirits in Heaven towards them:
for they are not compassionable Objects,
their Misery being the just effect of their
perverse obstinate Choice. And in
Hell all human tender Affections are
extinguisht for ever. Now 'tis the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of Misery, the excess of desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be deprived of all good things
pleasing to our Desires, and to suffer
all Evils from which we have the deepest
aversation and abhorrence. As in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
all good is eminently comprised,
and nothing but Good, so in Hell all
Evil is in excessive degrees, and nothing
but Evil.</p>
            <p>3. Temporal Evils are inflicted by
the mediation of second causes that are
of a limited power to hurt: but in the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:99572:124"/>
next World he more immediately tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
the Damned by his absolute Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
The Apostle tells us, that the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>are punished with everlasting Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the presence of the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Thess. 1.</note> 
               <hi>and the
Glory of his Power.</hi> What is the lashing
with a few Rushes, to a blow given by the
hand of a Giant that strikes dead at once?
This comparison is below the Truth.</p>
            <p>More particularly,<note place="margin">Indeed it is difficult to conceive how a material Fire can act on a spiritual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. But 'tis unreasonable to determine that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible. For if we consider what pain is, it is as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable how pure Spirits are capable of it, as Spirits in Conjunction with Bodies. The human Soul in its Nature is Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al as the Angels, yet has a painful sence of Fire or other afflicting Evils incumbent on the Sences. The Body meerly feels not pain, but it passes through the Body to the Soul. If the Soul by a strong diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Thoughts apply it self to an Object, the Body is insensible of pain, as is evident in some Diseases; and that in the heat of Battel, deep Wounds are not felt. And as God by a natural Constitution has orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the Body so touch'd and moved, excites a painful Sense in the Soul, he may have ordained that the Devils shall feel the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of Material Fire, in the places to which they shall be confin'd.</note> the state of Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is set forth in Scripture by such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations
as may powerfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
and terrifie even the most carnal
Men. Nothing is more intolerably
painful, then suffering the violence of
Fire inraged with Brimstone: and Hell
is described by a Lake of Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,
wherein the Wicked are tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.
Whether the Fire be Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
or Metaphorical, the reality and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenseness
of the Torment is signified by it.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:99572:124"/>
But the ordinary Fire, though mingled
with the most torturing Ingredients, is
not an adequate representation of it.
For that is prepared by Men, but the
Fire of Hell is prepared by the
Wrath of God for the Devil and his
Angels. The Divine Power is illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
manifested in that terrible prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
So that, as some of the Fathers
express it, if one of the Damned
might pass from those Flames into the
fiercest Fires here, it were to exchange
a Torment for a Refreshment. The
Scripture speaks of the vehement heat
and fiery Thirst, and outer Darkness in
which the Damned suffer, to satisfy the
rights of Justice in the torment of those
Senses, for the Pleasure of which Men
wilfully broke the Laws of God.</p>
            <p>But the Soul being the chief Sinner,
shall be the chief Mourner in those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
of Sorrow. An Image of this we
have in the Agonies of Spirit, which
sometimes the Saints themselves are in
here, and which the most stubborn Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
can neither resist nor endure. <hi>Job</hi> was
afflicted in that manner that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains,
<hi>The Arrows of the Almighty are
with me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job. 6. 4.</note> 
               <hi>the Poison whereof drinks up my
Spirit, the Terrors of God set themselves
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:99572:125"/>
in Array against me.</hi> If a Spark of his
Displeasure falls on the guilty Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
it tears and blows up all, as a
Fire-ball cast into a Magazine. All the
Diversions in the World, Business,
Pleasures, Merry Conversation, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
are as ineffectual to give free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from those Stings and Furies in
the Breast, as the sprinkling of Holy
Water is to expel a raging Divil from a
possest Person. Those who in their
Pride and Jollity, have despised serious
Religion, either as a fond Transport and
Extasy towards God, or a dull Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
and Dejection about the Soul, or
an idle Scrupulosity about indifferent
things, yet when God has set their Sins
with all their killing circumstances in
order before their Eyes, how changed,
how confounded are they at that Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition?
How restless with the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
expectation of the doom that attends
them! <hi>Belshazzer</hi> in the midst of his
Cups, and Herd of Concubines, by a
few Words written on the Wall, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
his Process and Judgment, was
so terrified by his guilty jealous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
that his Joints were loosed,
Nature sunk under the apprehension.
Now all these troubles of Mind, are but
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:99572:125"/>
the beginnings of Sorrows, but the
Smoak of the infernal Fornace, but ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nests
of that terrible Sum which divine
Justice will severely exact of the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Hell.</p>
            <p>Indeed these Examples are rare, and
not regarded by the most, and by some
lookt on as the effects of Distraction;
but to convince the bold and careless
Sinners who never felt the stings of an
awakned Conscience, what extream
terrors seize upon the Wicked in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
World, Consider,</p>
            <p>1. The Apprehension shall be more
clear and enlarged than in the present
State. Now the Soul is opprest with a
weight of Clay, and in Drowsiness and
Obscurity. The great things of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
are of little force to convince the
Conscience, or perswade the Affections.
But then the Soul shall work with the
quickest activity. The Mind shall by
an irresistible Light take a full view
of all afflicting Objects. The most stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
and unconcerned Sinners shall then
see and feel their ruin'd State, what a
glorious Felicity they have lost, what a
Misery they are plunged into, without
any possibility of lessening it by false
Conceits, and receiving any relief by
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:99572:126"/>
the error of Imagination.</p>
            <p>2. The mournful Thoughts shall be
always fixt upon what is tormenting.
The Soul in conjunction with the Body
cannot always apply it self to one sort
of Objects. For the Ministry of the
sensible Faculties is requisite to its Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
And the Body must be suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Eating and Drinking and Rest,
which interrupts troublesome Thoughts.
Besides the variety of Objects and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
here avert the Mind sometimes
from what is afflicting. But the sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Soul is in no dependence on the
Body, and after their reunion, there
shall be no necessity of Food or Sleep,
or any other animal actions to support
it, but it shall be restored to a new ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
for new torments, and preserved
in that miserable State by the power of
God. There will be nothing then to
divert the lost Soul from sad Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon its Misery. There are no lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid
intervals in Hell.</p>
            <p>3. All the passionate Powers will
then be let loose at once upon the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Creature. And if there be no single
Passion so weak, but heightned, will
break the Spirit, and render Life so
miserable, that a Man will take Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:99572:126"/>
in the Grave to escape, how mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
is the Condition when the most
fierce and united Passions war against
the Soul? This is signified by the never
dying Worm that gnaws on the tenderest
parts, and of quickest sence. Shame,
Sorrow, Despair, Fury, Hatred and
Revenge are some of that Blood of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
that torment the Damned.</p>
            <p>1. Shame is a Passion of which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Nature is very sensible, and this in
the highest degree of Confusion shall<note place="margin">Dan. 12. 2.</note>
seize on the Wicked. For all the just
causes of Shame shall then meet. The
inward source of it is the consciousness
of Guilt, or Turpitude and Folly in the
Actions; and all these are the insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Adjuncts of Sin. The guilty Soul
by a piercing reflection upon its Crimes,<note place="margin">Tacitâ su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant praecor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia culpa. <hi>Juv.</hi>
               </note>
has a secret shame of its Degeneracy
and Unworthiness. The Passion is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creast,
when a discovery is made of vile
practices that defile and debase a Man,
expose to Contempt and Infamy, before
Persons of high Quality and eminent
Vertue, whom we admire and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and whose esteem we value. To
be surprized in an unworthy Action by
such a Person, disorders the Blood, and
transfuses a Colour into the Face, to
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:99572:127"/>
cover it with a Vail of Blushing. And
the more numerous the Spectators are,
the more the Disgrace is aggravated.
And if Derision be joined with the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy,
it causes extream Displeasure.
O the universal Confusion, the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powring
amazement that will seise on
Sinners in the great day of Discovery,
when all the Works of Darkness, all
their base Sensualities shall be revealed
before God Angels and Saints? When
all the covers of Shame shall be taken
off, the excuses and denials, to extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
or conceal their Sins shall vanish, and
their Breasts be transparent to the Eyes
of all: How will they be ashamed of
their foul and permanent Deformity in
the Light of that glorious Presence?
How will they be astonisht to appear in
all their Pollutions before that bright
and immense Theatre? How will they
be confounded to stand in all their Guilt
before that sublime and severe Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal?
How will they endure the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braidings
for all the Sins which they
have so wickedly committed, and the
derision for the punishment they so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly
suffer? The holy Judg will
<hi>laugh at their Calamity, and mock when
their fear comes. The Righteous also
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:99572:127"/>
shall see, and shall laugh at them,</hi> Lo
these are the Men that made not God
their Portion, but perishing Vanities,
that prefer'd sweet Folly before severe
Wisdom. The Devils will reproach
them for that scornful advantage they
had over them, that as Children are
seduc'd for things of Lustre to part with
real Treasures, so they were easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded
for the Trifles of Time to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
Eternal Happiness. <hi>Whither
will they cause their Shame to go?</hi> Those
black Sinners that here never change
colour for their Filthiness,<note place="margin">Jer. 14. 12.</note> that hardned
by custom in Sin, are impenetrable to
Shame, as the brute Beasts that are abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
destitute of reason, nay that have
not only overcome all tenderness, but
<hi>glory in their Shame,</hi> shall glow at the
manifestation of their sordid Lusts, their
vile Servilities, and be covered with
Confusion, and the sence of it shall be
revived in their Minds for ever.</p>
            <p>2. To open Shame is joined the
greatest inward Sorrow. This Passion
when violent penetrates the Soul in all
its Faculties, and fastens it to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
Object. When it dwells in the
Bosom, it gives an easy entrance to
what ever cherishes and increases it,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:99572:128"/>
and rejects what might asswage and
lessen the sence of the Evil. The most
pleasant things do not excite desire or
joy, but exasperate Grief. Like those
Animals that convert the best nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into their own Poison; so deep
Sorrow receives mournful impressions
from all things, and turns the sweetest
Comforts of Life into Wormwood and
Gall. The causes of Sorrow are either
the loss of some valued Good, or the
sence of some present Evil. And the
Sorrow is more violent, as the Cause is
great in it self, and in the apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and tenderness of the Sufferers.
Now both these Causes with all the
heavy Circumstances that can multiply
and aggravate Sorrow, meet in Hell
the Centre of Misery.</p>
            <p>The loss is inconceivably great. If <hi>Cain</hi>
when banisht from the Society of the
Saints, where God was publickly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipt,
and by spiritual Revelations and
visible Apparitions, graciously made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
known, cry'd out in anguish of Soul,
<hi>My punishment is greater than I can bear,
from thy Face shall I be hid, and I shall
be a Fugitive upon the Earth,</hi> how into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
will be the final separation from
his glorious and joyful Presence? 'Tis
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:99572:128"/>
often seen how tenderly and impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
the human Spirit resents the loss
of a dear Relation. <hi>Jacob</hi> for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
Death of <hi>Joseph,</hi> was so overcome
with Grief, <hi>that when all his Sons and
Daughters rose up to comfort him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
to be comforted, and said, I will go
down to the Grave unto my Son mourning.</hi>
This is a Sin and a punishment.<note place="margin">Jussisti Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine &amp; sic est, ut poena sit sibi omnis inordinatus affectus. <hi>Aug.</hi>
               </note> 'Tis
establisht by the righteous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
Decree of God, that every
inordinate Affection in Man should be
his own Tormentor. But if the loss of
a poor frail Creature for a short time be
so afflicting, how insupportable will be
the Sorrow, for the loss of an infinite
Eternal Good? It may be a carnal
Wretch may think comfortably of this
now, whilst he lives in Pleasures, but
in the next World he shall be totally
deprived of all things that please his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous
Senses, and shall understand
what a misery it is to lose the favour
and enjoyment of the blessed God.
Our Saviour told the Jews, <hi>There shall
be weeping and gnashing of Teeth</hi> (the
Symptoms of extreme Sorrow) <hi>when ye
shall see</hi> Abraham, <hi>and</hi> Isaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob,
<hi>and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of
God, and you your selves thrust out.</hi> The
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:99572:129"/>
sight of that blessed Company entring
into the sacred Mansions of Light, will
make the loss of Heaven infinitely more
discernable and terrible to the Wicked,
who shall be cast into <hi>outer Darkness,</hi>
and for ever be deprived of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with God and his Saints.</p>
            <p>With the loss of the most excellent
Good, the suffering of the most afflicting
painful Evil is join'd. The Sentence is, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
ye cursed into everlasting Fire.</hi> And if
an imaginary Sorrow conceived in the
Mind without a real external Cause, as
in Melancholly Persons, when gross
Vapours darken and corrupt the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and purity of the Spirits that are
requisite for its chearful Operations, is
often so oppressing that Nature sinks
under it, how insupportable will the
Sorrow of condemned Sinners be, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the impression and sence of God's
Almighty and avenging Hand, when it
shall fully appear how pure and holy he
is in his Anger for Sin, how just and
dreadful in punishing Sinners? It may
be the indulgent Sinner may lessen his
fear of Hell, by fancying the number of
Sufferers will asswage the sence of their
Misery. But this is a foolish mistake.
For the number of Sufferers shall be so
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:99572:129"/>
far from affording any relief, that the
Misery is aggravated by the Company
and Communication of the Miserable.
Every one is surrounded with Sorrows,
and by the sights of Woe about him,
feels the universal Grief. The weeping
and wailing, the cries and dolorous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of all the Damned, increases
the torment and vexation of every one.
As when the Wind conspires with the
Flame 'tis more fierce and spreading.</p>
            <p>3. The Concomitant of Sorrow will
be Fury and Rage against themselves, as
the true causes of their Misery. For
God will make such a discovery of his
righteous Judgment, that not only the
Saints shall glorify his Justice in the
condemnation of the Wicked, but they
shall be so convinc'd of it, as not to be
able to charge their Judg with any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of Mercy, or excess of Rigour in
his proceedings against them. As the
Man in the Parable of the Marriage-Feast,
when taxt for his presumptuous
intrusion without a Wedding Garment,
<hi>how camest thou in hither?</hi> was speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less:
so they will find no plea for their
Justification and Defence, but must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the eternal Doom with Silence
and Confusion. Then Conscience shall
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:99572:130"/>
revive the bitter remembrance of all the
methods of divine Mercy for their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
that were ineffectual by their
Contempt and Obstinacy. All the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate
calls of his Word, with the
holy Motions of the Spirit, were like
the sowing of Seed in the Stony Ground,
that took no root, and never came to
perfection. All his terrible Threatnings
were but as Thunder to the Deaf, or
Lightning to the Blind, that little affects
them: the bounty of his Providence
design'd <hi>to lead them to Repentance,</hi> had
the same effect, as the Showers of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon Briers and Thorns that makes
them grow the faster. And that a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
so ready to pardon, did not produce
in them a correspondent affection of
grateful obedient Love, but by the most
unworthy provocations they pluckt
down the Vengeance due to obstinate
Rebels, will so enrage the Damned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
themselves, that they will be less
miserable by the Misery they suffer, than
by the conviction of their torn Minds,
that they were the sole Causes of it.
<hi>What Repentings will be kindled within
them,</hi> for the stupid neglect of the great
Salvation so dearly purchased, and
earnestly offered to them? What a fiery
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:99572:130"/>
addition to their Torment, that when
God was so willing to save them, they
were so willful to be Damned. They
will never forgive themselves, that for
the short and mean Pleasures of Sense,
which if enjoyed a thousand years, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
recompence the loss of Heaven, nor
requite the pains of Hell for an Hour,
they must be deprived of the one and
suffer the other for ever.</p>
            <p>4. The Sorrow and Rage will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
by Dispair: for when the
wretched Sinner sees the Evil is peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
and no Outlet of Hope, he aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
himself to the violence of Sorrow,
and by cruel Thoughts wounds the
Heart more, than the fiercest Furies in
Hell can. This Misery that flows from
dispair shall be more fully opened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the distinct consideration of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Hell.</p>
            <p>And as from Dispair the condemned
Creature turns Enemy to himself, so to
God. 'Tis said of the Worshippers of
the Image of the Beast,<note place="margin">Rev. 16. 10, 11.</note> that <hi>they gnawed
their Tongues for Pain, and blasphemed
the God of Heaven because of their Pains.</hi>
The Torment and Blasphemies of those
impenitent Idolaters, are a representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the state of the Damned, where
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:99572:131"/>
the just and dreadful Wrath of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Men, and the impious Rage of Men
against God is in the highest degrees.
For when the guilty Sufferers are so
weak, that they neither by Patience
can sustain their Torments, nor by
Strength resist the Power that inflicts
them; yet are wicked and stubborn;
they are irritated by their Misery, and
foam out Blasphemies against the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Judg. They hate God with a
direct Enmity, and are always under
his invincible tormenting Power. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
takes pleasure in Revenge, either
real or imaginary. The Damned
Wretches were they as Omnipotent to
Effect, as they are malicious to Desire,
would dethrone God, and destroy his
Being. But he is infinitely above the
transports of their Fury. All their
rancorous cursed imprecations, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexively
pernicious to themselves; like
Arrows shot up against the Sun, that
fall down upon their Heads that shot
them. Now what more inrages a stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
malicious Spirit, than to be utterly
unable to reach and hurt an irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Enemy, the object of its habitual
detestation? Briefly, as the blessed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
are in Heaven, and Heaven is in
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:99572:131"/>
them, by those holy and joyful Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
that are always exercised in the
Divine Presence, so the Damned are in
Hell, and Hell is in them by those fierce
and miserable Passions that continually
prey upon them.</p>
            <p>4. The Eternity of their Misery
makes it above all other Considerations
intollerable. Our Saviour repeats it
thrice in the space of a few Verses, to
terrify those who spare some favourite
Corruption, <hi>that in Hell their Worm dies
not, and the Fire is never quenched.</hi> God
will never reverse his Sentence, and
they shall never change their State.
How willingly would carnal Men raze
the Word <hi>Eternal</hi> out of the Scriptures,
but to their grief they find it joined
with the Felicity of Heaven, and the
Torments of Hell. The second Death
has all the terrible qualities of the first,
but not the ease and end it brings to
Misery. All the Tears of those forlorn
Wretches, shall never quench one spark
of the Fire. Where are the delicious
Fair, the Musick, the Purple, and all
the carnal Delights of the rich Man?
they are all changed into a contrary
state of Misery, and that state is fixt for
ever. From his vanishing Paradise he
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:99572:132"/>
descended into an everlasting Hell. In
this the Vengeance of God is infinitely
more heavy than the most terrible exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
from Men. Human Justice and
Power can inflict but one Death (that
will be soon dispatcht) upon a Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
worthy to suffer a hundred Deaths;
if he be condemned to the Fire, they
cannot make him live and die together,
to burn and not be consumed: But God
will so far support the Damned in their
Torments, that they shall always have
Strength to feel, though no Strength to
endure them. Those extream Torments
which would extinguish the present
Life in a Moment, shall be suffered for
ever. This Consideration infinitely
aggravates the Misery. For the lost
Soul rackt with the fearful Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of what it must suffer for ever,
feels as it were at once all the Evils that
shall torment it in its whole duration.
The perpetuity of the Misery is always
felt by prevision. This is as the cruel
breaking of the Bones upon the Wheel,
when the Soul is tormented by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
of Misery that without allays shall
continue in the circulation of Eternal
Ages. To make this more sensible, let
us consider, that pain makes the Mind
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:99572:132"/>
observant of the passing of the hours.
In Pleasures, Time with a quick and
silent motion insensibly slides away: but
in Troubles the Hours are tedious, in vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
pains we reckon the minutes as long.
'Tis observable how passionately the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Psalmist complains,<note place="margin">Psal. 77. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Will the Lord cast
off for ever? Will he be favourable no more?
Doth his Promise fail for evermore? Hath
he forgotten to be gracious? Hath he in
anger shut up his tender Mercies?</hi> In
what various pathetic forms does he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the same Affection? Though he
had assurance that the gracious God
would not be always severe, yet his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
forc'd from him complaints as if
the moment of his Trouble were an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.
But what strains of Sorrow
are among the Damned, who besides
the present sence of their Misery, have
always in their Thoughts the vast E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
wherein they must suffer it?</p>
            <p>When three terrible Evils were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to <hi>David</hi>'s choice, pining Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
for three years, or bloody War
for three Months, or devouring Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
for three days, he chose the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
though in it self the heaviest Evil.</p>
            <p>Many sad Days must pass under the
other Judgments, where Death by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:99572:133"/>
in such variety of Shapes
would be presented to the Mind, that
the lingring expectation of it would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
more than the sudden stroke:
whereas the fury of the Pestilence would
be soon over. But the Damned have
not this relief, <hi>but shall be tormented day
and night for ever and ever.</hi> How ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
<hi>do they seek for Death,</hi> but cannot
find it? what a favour would they
esteem it to be annihilated? For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
if when the Evils in the present
State are so multiplyed, that no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
is left, or so violent that the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Person cannot enjoy them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
his sorrowful Spirit, Death is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
rather than Life, it cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
that in the future State where the
Misery is extream, and nothing remains
to allay it, that the Damned should be
in love with the unhappy good of sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
being, and not choose an absolute
extinction if it might be.</p>
            <p>If any one should be so foolish to think
that custom will render that State more
tolerable, he may find a terrible confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his vain Fancy. Indeed continuance
under light Evils, may arm the Mind with
patience to bear them, but in great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
it makes the Evil more pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:99572:133"/>
and intolerable. He that is tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
with the Stone, or on the Rack,
the longer the Torture continues, the
less able he is to sustain it. In short, as
the Joy of Heaven is infinitely more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing,
that the Blessed are without
fear of losing it; so the Misery of Hell
is proportionably tormenting, that the
Damned are absolutely destitute of hopes
of a release. <hi>O 'tis a fearful thing to fall
into the hands of the living God,</hi> who
lives for ever, and can punish for ever.
Now the serious Consideration of this
Misery, is the most proper and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
means to awaken indulgent Sinners,
and make them resolved <hi>to cut off the
right hand, and pluck out the right Eye,</hi> to
part with the dearest Lusts rather than
be exposed to it. According to the
judgment of Sense, would any one in his
Wits choose the enjoyment of the most
intense and exquisite Pleasures for a
Year, and afterwards be content to burn
in a Fornace for a Day, much less to
enjoy them for a Day, and to burn for
a Year? what stupid Beasts are they
who for momentary Delights incur the
Fiery and Eternal Indignation of God?
<hi>Do we provoke the Lord to Jealousy?</hi> are
we stronger than he? Try but the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:99572:134"/>
with the Flame of a Candle, or
touch but a hot Coal; you will soon
discover your weakness. But alas, how
hardly are Men induc't to exercise their
Minds on this terrible Object. He thinks
least of Hell, who has most reason to
consider it: so unwilling is the carnal
Heart to have represented to it the evil
to come. Yet this is the first Motive
that compels Sinners to change their
course, and turn from Sin to Holiness,
from the Creatures to God. The Joys
of Heaven being Spiritual and Divine
(as was before observed) have no attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
influence upon their Affections,
would never convert and reform any,
but the torment of Fire being most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and vehement to Sense, is strongly
represented by the Imagination, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
carnal Men. How many abound
with vicious obstinate habits, that by
solemn and believing thoughts of the
unquenchable Fire, have felt the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
upon the three Children in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,
renewed in themselves, their
strong Cords burnt asunder, and all
their Powers restored to the freedom
of Duty, the blessed liberty of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
The Truth is, if God had not
formed Hell for the Punishment of Sin,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:99572:134"/>
and only prepared the Celestial King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
for the Reward of Holiness, the
blessed Angels would be the sole Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
of it, and Heaven would be as emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of human Souls as 'tis full of Glory:
so foolishly and violently is the corrupt
nature of Man drawn by what is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to Sense, though with the certain
loss of the most precious and eternal
good things in the Divine Treasury.
But the belief that within a little time
nothing will remain of their sinful Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
<hi>but the never dying Worm, and ever
living Flames,</hi> makes them considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of their imminent danger, and as it
were by necessity to seek the Kingdom
of Heaven, as a secondary Object to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
from Hell. As the vertue of the
Load-stone when encompast and arm'd
with Iron, is increast, and draws a far
greater weight than when 'tis single, thus
the attractives of Heaven are more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
to move our obdurate Hearts, when
enforc'd from the terrors of Hell. In this
respect, <hi>the fear of the Lord is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Wisdom,</hi> of the active and best
Wisdom, that directs us in the way to
Blessedness.</p>

            <p>HAving a discovery so clear and
certain in the Holy Scriptures of
the everlasting recompences in the next
World, of the Kingdom of Heaven, (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
by God to shew his excellent Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to his faithful Servants) where Love
and Peace and Joy dwell for ever, and
of the infernal Prison, where despair
and Rage and Sorrow, and whatever is
signified under the terrible allusions of
Fire and Brimstone, are ordained by
Divine Justice for the Wicked, it might
be justly hoped, that all Men <hi>would by
a holy violence take Heaven, and by the
swiftest Motion flee from the Wrath to come.</hi>
The instinct of Nature and the light of
Reason excite them to secure their most
precious Interest. Can there be an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
Desire or Capacity in Man of
enjoying a Blessedness beyond what is
Infinite and Eternal? And can there be
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:99572:135"/>
any Evil so formidable as Everlasting
Misery? Now both these Objects are set
before Men, and propounded to their
Choice. And we are infallibly assured
from God himself, that all who are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
and constant in their Choice and
Pursuit, shall obtain Heaven, and that
none shall be cast into Hell, but those
who choose it, and therefore most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
suffer it. But, O astonishment!
if with a serious Eye we regard the
course of Mens Actions, 'tis visible that
incomparably the greatest number of
Christians in Profession <hi>love Death, and
hate Eternal Life.</hi> Not that 'tis possible
for the reasonable Creature to do this
directly, with an explicit aim, but vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
and by interpretation. They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
Happiness, but choose Misery. For he
that voluntarily breaks the Law of God,
chooses the known Penalty of its Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
He that prefers this perishing
World before Heaven, rejects it in
the most contumelious manner. And
such is the depravation of Man since his
Fall, the Mind being diverted by vain
Thoughts, and the Heart prepossessed
with sensual Desires, <hi>that till the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of his Mind be renewed,</hi> and his
original Affections to the Supream
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:99572:136"/>
Good be revived and restored by
Divine Grace, he is regardless of
it, and only applies himself to what
is pleasing to Sense. Therefore a most
necessary Duty incumbent upon us, is by
humble and fervent Prayer to address
our selves to God for his Spirit, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
our Minds, that we may believe
the reality and greatness of the Eternal
Reward, and to reform our Wills that
we may feel its attractive Force. Both
these acts of the Spirit are requisite, that
the Love of God, as our chief Felicity,
may be the regent Principle of our
Hearts and Lives.</p>
            <p>1. For this end the Holy Spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
Men thorowly of the reality and
greatness of an invisible Happiness. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Heathens saw something of this
as it were in a Dream, they had some
transient Glances, and volatile Wishes,
concerning it, but miserably weak and
ineffectual. And in the most of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
the convictions of a future State
are not so clear and strong as to govern
their Hearts and Lives. How many of
eminent intellectual Faculties are stupid
as to their great Interest, and spend
themselves about Trifles, and are equally
tractable to Eternal Ruine, as the Ox to
the Slaughter? He that is destitute of
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:99572:136"/>
the illuminating Grace of the Spirit, <hi>is
blind and cannot see afar off.</hi> Now by the
Analogy between the corporal and the
intellectual Faculties, we may understand
in some measure how the Mind is illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
by the Spirit of God. For as to
the act of Seeing, two things are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site,
1. External Light in the Air,
without which the Colours, Figures and
Beauties of Objects are not visible to
the sharpest Eye, but lie obscur'd under
impenitrable Darkness. 2. Internal
Light in the Eye in which the visive
Power consists: if this be extinguish'd
the clearest Light of Heaven is of no use
for the discovery of Things. Thus the
Understanding is enabled to see Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Things. 1. By the revelation of the
Object: in this respect <hi>Life and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
are brought to Light by the Gospel.</hi>
Till that bright discovery was made of
Eternal Blessedness, it was above the
desires and hopes of sinful Man. <hi>Coelum,
homo nec optare poterat ex ignorantia, nec
sperare ex propriae miseriae conscientia.</hi>
2. By the inward inlightning <hi>from the
Spirit of Wisdom,</hi> that removes the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
Prejudice and Inadvertency of
the Mind, which as Scales darkned its
Sight, and disposes it to perceive the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:99572:137"/>
verity and excellency of spiritual and
future Things, though not with compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
evidence, yet with that assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
that no doubtfulness or suspence
remains concerning them. 'Tis obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
that Faith is exprest in Scripture,
by <hi>Prudence, Wisdom, and Knowledg,</hi>
whereby a Man knows the grounds and
motives of his Judgment and Actions.
And Sin is called <hi>Folly.</hi> For as when
the understanding Faculty, either from
the indisposedness of the Organs, as in
Idiots, or from the disorder of Fancy
by the inflammation of the Humours, as
in distracted Persons, cannot weigh and
compare, and therefore makes a perverse
judgment of things; so the carnal Mind
by not due measuring and pondering,
judges falsly of Spiritual Things. If
something no bigger than the Hand were
put before the Eye, it would intercept
the Sight of the Heavens; and he that
not considering the properties of things
near and distant, should conclude that
piece to be bigger than the Heavens,
were justly reputed a Fool. And the
Folly of carnal Men is more gross, who
prefer things present to Sense, before
what is future and of everlasting conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to the Soul. But there are some
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:99572:137"/>
actions which if done by a Natural,
would be counted Folly, yet being done
by those who in the reputation of the
World are Wise, are esteemed Prudent,
but they are the most deplorable Folly.
Now as the restoring the <hi>Laesum princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium,</hi>
the broken Mind to its sound State,
whereby 'tis able to consider, discern
and conclude of things according to their
Nature, such is the action of God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
upon the corrupt Mind, clarifying
and enlightning it, so that it receives
full conviction by the clearest marks of
divine Authority shining in the Gospel
of the Truth of all the great and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Promises therein contained, and
causing it by a steddy application of the
Thoughts to see the vast difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
what is Temporal, and Eternal,
how despicably light all the Vanities of
this World are found, when put in the
Ballance against the infinite inestimable
Happiness of the next. In short, the
renewed Mind knows Spiritual Things
according to their Nature and Qualities,
believes, esteems, and determins that
they are of Eternal moment, and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary for the Happiness of
Man. And as when the natural Faculty
of seeing is perish'd, 'tis irreparable by
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:99572:138"/>
human Skill, and without a Miracle can
never be restored, so the intellectual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
when darkned by sinful Lusts,
without the renewing power of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<hi>can never know Spiritual Things as they
ought to be known.</hi> Therefore as the
blind Men in the Gospel who dispair'd
of help from the Physicians, hearing of
the miraculous Power of Christ, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately
begg'd his healing Mercy,
so let us pray to the Light and Saviour
of the World, but in a more noble and
higher Sense, <hi>Lord that we may receive
our sight.</hi> Let us with the most zealous
Affections call upon <hi>the God of our Lord
Jesus Christ, the Father of Glory, that he
would give unto us the Spirit of Wisdom
and Revelation in the knowledg of him, the
Eyes of our understanding being inlightned,
that we may know what is the hope of his
Calling, and what the Riches of the Glory
of his Inheritance in the Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The efficacious Influence of the
Holy Spirit is requisite to change the
Will, that with a free and full consent
it may desire and prosecute the Spiritual
Eternal Good. Without this, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of the Mind is not powerful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to convert the Soul from the love
of the World, to choose Heaven.
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:99572:138"/>
There may be an inlightned Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
without a renewed Heart.
Though the Judgment assents that God
is the Supream Good, <hi>yet till the Heart
be circumcised,</hi> the sensuality of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
taken away, divine Love that
directs the Life to God as our blessed
End, can never possess it. Suppose
that Men had a sensible and strong assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the Eternal State hereafter, if
all those who lived godly in a visible
manner ascended with <hi>Elias</hi> to Heaven,
and if all who continued in their Sins
visibly descended into Hell, as <hi>Corah</hi>
and his Company were swallowed up
alive by the Earth, before the <hi>Israelites,</hi>
if Men could hear the joyful Exultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Saints above, their high
Praises of God, and hear the desperate
Crys and deep Complaints of the
Damned: if one according to the desire
of the rich Man were sent from Hell,
and with his Fiery Tongue should
preach a Sermon of those Torments, not
describing them at a distance, but by a
sensible demonstration in himself, yet
this alone were not sufficient to draw off
their Hearts from the deceitful Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of this World, and fasten them on
the perfect and Eternal Happiness in the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:99572:139"/>
next. Indeed they could not then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
their Lusts so securely, but they
<hi>would be Strangers to the Life of God,</hi>
such an inveterate alienation of Heart
is in Men from real Holiness. Till the
sanctifying Spirit by a directive per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasive
Light that represents the Truth
and Goodness of Spiritual Things,
transforms the Soul, and makes it
Spiritual in its Valuations and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
'tis inwardly averse from
Grace and Glory. <hi>The Lord direct our
Hearts into the Love of God, and into the
patient waiting for Christ, when he shall
come to be glorified in his Saints, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
in all them that believe.</hi>
