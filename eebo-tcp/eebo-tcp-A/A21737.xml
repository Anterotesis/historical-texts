            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And becauſe her Maieſtie hath ben partly infourmed, that ſome abuſe hath ben heretofore in ſome mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, hauyng charge to make payment of the lyke ſommes lent to her Maieſtie, contrarie to her meanyng, and that in ſome part of the Realme, ſome of her good ſubiectes haue ben by ſiniſter dealing induced to make payment of parcels of the money demaunded by priuie Seale, whiche ſummes haue ben retayned and not payde ouer to her Maieſties vſe, and ſome alſo hath ben payde or lent by way of reward, to procure a forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to lende any to her Maieſtie, which abuſes her Maieſtie meaneth to cauſe to be ſearched, tryed, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. And therefore for more ſuretie, that none of her ſubiectes, that hath lent to her Maieſtie, vpon her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie Seales, any ſumme of money, ſhoulde be delayed or miſuſed in the repayment: Her Maieſtie hath geuen commiſſion to the Lorde Keeper of her great Seale, the Erle of Leiceſter, the Lorde of Burghley, and ſyr Walter Myldmay knight, to direct the repayment thereof in this ſort: That whoſoeuer ſhall bryng her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties letters of her priuie Seale, with the ſubſcription, or byll of the Collectour, teſtifying the receipt of any money demaunded and conteyned in the ſayde priuie Seale, and ſhewe the ſame to the Lorde Keeper, or to any of the others, ioyned with him in commiſſion for this purpoſe, ſhall haue order immediatly to receaue the whole ſumme due to hym, at Weſtminſter, without paying any maner rewarde to any officer, or perſon, for the payment, or for any maner colour of expedition therein. And yf any perſon to whom the ſame ſhal be due, be not hable, or ſhall not be diſpoſed to come perſonally for the ſame, to any of the ſayde Commiſſioners, or that (it may be) the ſame may be deceaſſed, &amp; ſo the debt due to ſome other: In thoſe caſes, ſo as the letters of priuie Seale, and the ſubſcription or byll of the Collectour, teſtifying the receipt thereof, be preſented with ſome letter of atturney, or other aſſignation in wrytyng, ſufficiently aucthoriſing the partie that ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the ſame for receipt thereof: the ſayde perſon ſhall alſo haue preſent free and full payment, and without delay or rewarde, in any ſort or maner. For ſuche is her Maieſties intent, that her louyng ſubiectes ſhoulde be thankefully and freely payde, whiche alſo ſhoulde haue ben to their proper handes in the countreys: but for more delayes and vncertaynties, that thereof many wayes myght folowe, to the hynderaunce of her ſubiectes.</p>
