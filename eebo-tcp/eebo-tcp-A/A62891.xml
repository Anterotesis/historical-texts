            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Honoured Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BEfore I presume to beg your <hi>Patronage,</hi> I must bespeak your <hi>Pardon.</hi> You might indeed justly wonder, how I should think my self able to judge what were material in this weighty <hi>Controversie</hi>; did I not live in an age of so much <hi>Light,</hi> that there are <hi>two things</hi> we are all able to do: <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Reform a Church,</hi> and <hi>Model a State.</hi> There is <hi>a Fault</hi> (I must confess) in <hi>Our</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49587:3"/>
(as in <hi>All</hi>) <hi>Governments,</hi> which as some men are resolved never to Pardon, so I have no hope ever to see mended, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>all are not uppermost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is <hi>an Objection</hi> will be made against this Innocent Treatise, that it is wrote against <hi>Consciencious men.</hi> I cannot deny but that the concerned Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are admirably furnished with <hi>Consciences</hi> for every occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To prevent this Cavil, my appeal is to You who know what <hi>conscience</hi> is; having suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered so much to preserve a good one: <hi>A tryal,</hi> those Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen were never very forward to undergo, nor (if my Augury fail me not) ever mean to be. That <hi>sacred thing</hi> (or what was
<pb facs="tcp:49587:3"/>
mistaken for it, or at least called by that Name) hath done strange things in this Nation, which it highly concerns some to enquire whether it will justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. We read in Scripture of <hi>Obeying for conscience</hi>; but not one word of <hi>Rebelling for it.</hi> And yet men can do it, and at the same time make <hi>the written Word</hi> the rule of their Action. It first di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished between <hi>the Kings Person</hi> and His <hi>Power,</hi> and next between his <hi>head</hi> &amp; his <hi>shoulders.</hi> And truly, they who once <hi>divide the Kings Person</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> are concerned that they never <hi>unite</hi> again.</p>
            <p>Because men do dayly <hi>disobey Laws</hi> upon the score of <hi>conscience,</hi> and for that reason take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb facs="tcp:49587:4"/>
and are taken by others, for <hi>Innocent</hi>; I shall beg your leave to ask this Question, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>following Conscience</hi> is a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Plea to quit us from <hi>sin,</hi> even where it is so indeed? (To say nothing of those Universal Pretenders, <hi>Artifice</hi> and <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.</hi>) The Scripture maketh mention of <hi>seared Consciences, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate minds,</hi> which sure are no great perfections; and of <hi>strong delusions,</hi> which though they be <hi>new lights</hi> are but <hi>flashes of hell-fire.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> reckons him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <hi>the greatest of sinners,</hi> for what he did out of the dictates of <hi>conscience</hi> [<hi>I my self thought verily that I ought to do many,</hi> &amp;c.] These are competent grounds of rendring that <hi>Tenent</hi> suspicious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49587:4"/>I ask therefore briefly, Hath <hi>the conscience</hi> any <hi>rule</hi> besides it self, or no? If not; How is <hi>the written Word</hi> of God <hi>the rule</hi> of Action? If it have; Whether it be possible for it to swerve from its Rule, or no? If not; then every man is <hi>infallible,</hi> there can be no such thing as <hi>strong delusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, believing a lie,</hi> &amp;c. If it be possible for <hi>conscience</hi> to swarve from its <hi>Rule</hi>; whether its <hi>swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> be its <hi>Innocency?</hi> For if it be not so, it is no sufficient ground for men to conclude themselves <hi>innocent,</hi> when they <hi>disobey Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> because it is <hi>their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> so to do, because <hi>the Word of God</hi> (to which <hi>Conscience</hi> as well as other <hi>Faculties</hi> ought to be subject, and sins when it is not)
<pb facs="tcp:49587:5"/>
prescribes <hi>obedience to Governours</hi> in the most universal terms ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable. I could not but say thus much; because, [<hi>This is our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>] was the old <hi>non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi> first plea, and the latter (in name only different) <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> only plea; and if it be a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent one, it must hold <hi>in all cases</hi> as well as <hi>any</hi>: because the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is equal in all. It may justifie those many who killed <hi>the King,</hi> and those many more who kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>our Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My want of years and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I shall not at all <hi>excuse,</hi> but <hi>urge</hi> as my fitness for this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; It were a disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>the University of Oxford,</hi> if such an Antagonist could not be answered by one of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
<pb facs="tcp:49587:5"/>
who can plead relation to so Renowned a Body.</p>
            <p>The many weaknesses you will find in <hi>these papers</hi> are so many evidences that I came to <hi>Oxford</hi> in <hi>times of Reformation,</hi> when <hi>Learning</hi> was counted lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle lesse then an enemy to <hi>Grace,</hi> as indeed it was to what they called so.</p>
            <p>Our Imperfections <hi>(Honored Sir)</hi> we blush not to discover to you whose goodness will not <hi>see</hi> them but only to <hi>remove</hi> them: whose business is, not so much to <hi>preside,</hi> in a Colledge, as to <hi>reform</hi> it; to be our <hi>Warden,</hi> as <hi>Example.</hi> Like <hi>the Sun</hi> who when he <hi>rules</hi> the world, <hi>enlightens</hi> it too, when he <hi>shines</hi> he <hi>cherishes</hi>; so that its most spendid <hi>Majesty</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49587:6"/>
is but <hi>Love</hi> in all its glory: So your Commands are so many <hi>boons,</hi> and injunctions <hi>endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>: so that you do not <hi>rule</hi> but <hi>assist</hi> and <hi>oblige</hi> us; and have now abundantly satisfyed the Obligation <hi>the Founder</hi> laid upon you of <hi>promoting the good of the Colledge</hi> to your uttermost, by vouchsafing to take us into your particular care.

               </hi> Very well foresee, that many (who are conscious to themselves, that such things are possible) will <hi>laugh</hi> and <hi>scorn</hi> at the <hi>Author</hi> of this <hi>Treatise,</hi> as one who meant to write <hi>the sense</hi> of <hi>the Times,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then <hi>his own.</hi> In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning therefore, I <hi>bar all</hi> who have been themselves <hi>guilty</hi> of what they only suppose to be, <hi>viz.</hi> Our <hi>late Complyers,</hi> whose <hi>conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> have been in this sense <hi>tender,</hi> that they might be <hi>bended</hi> any way.

my most numerous and severe <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers.</hi> But, now I think on it, I will <hi>release</hi> them too; let them employ all their <hi>art</hi> and <hi>passion,</hi> in telling the World, <hi>how unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy such Proceedings</hi> (while they have been their own) <hi>are.</hi> For why should I <hi>hinder</hi> such men from <hi>laughing</hi> at themselves?

            </p>
            <p>This Account is <hi>civil enough</hi> for these men: I should gladly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford them another, if I had any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to think so well of them, that their <hi>Principles</hi> would not <hi>fail</hi> them: if it should once happen, that they would <hi>consist</hi> with their <hi>duty</hi>; and that their <hi>beloved

            <p>My <hi>own faults,</hi> in <hi>the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,</hi> are so <hi>many,</hi> that I would not willingly be obliged to <hi>answer</hi> for <hi>any more</hi> then <hi>mine own</hi>; viz. <hi>The Ill-timing,</hi> &amp;c. But
<pb facs="tcp:49587:8"/>
how to assure those men (I before spoke of) of the <hi>truth</hi> of any thing I shall <hi>assert,</hi> about my <hi>own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions</hi> in that, or any thing else; I profess I am <hi>utterly Ignorant</hi>: since <hi>they,</hi> out of their <hi>own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi> of themselves, very well know, that the most <hi>Solemn Oaths</hi> and <hi>Imprecations,</hi> are not <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Evidences</hi> of ones <hi>sincere meaning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there are <hi>others,</hi> who are capable of, and therefore deserve, a <hi>better account</hi>; who as they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred <hi>Time-serving</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, are loath to <hi>suspect it</hi> in <hi>another</hi>: it being very <hi>hard</hi> for him who doth <hi>no ill</hi> himself, to think, without great cause, <hi>Ill</hi> of another. To them I say thus:</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49587:8"/>Whoever thinks this time <hi>unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi> for a <hi>Treatise</hi> of this <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> my opinion is so perfectly the same with his, that, had it been in mine own choyce, I should not have needed to have told the World so. And this I <hi>insisted</hi> upon in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Letters to <hi>one</hi> of that <hi>place</hi> and <hi>prudence</hi> (whose commands it was scarce manners for me to dispute) more pressingly then many others (perhaps the most censorious) would.</p>
            <p>I urged that the Contest was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>the Covenant,</hi> which had been already <hi>answered</hi> by the Parliament; The only way it <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served</hi> to be <hi>considered.</hi> And to compose such <hi>a Treatise,</hi> would be but to produce <hi>evidence</hi> against
<pb facs="tcp:49587:9"/>
               <hi>one</hi> who was <hi>executed</hi> the week before. But this Objection doth not, I confess, reach the case so ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as I apprehended it would, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had exactly read over Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> Book; because Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> sometimes in <hi>pursuit</hi> of his <hi>Argument,</hi> oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in <hi>running away</hi> from it, doth insert <hi>Principles</hi> no way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to <hi>the Covenant,</hi> then as they may be <hi>subservient</hi> to <hi>the main</hi> (though <hi>disowned</hi>) <hi>end</hi> of <hi>the Composers</hi> of it, viz. <hi>Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy in Church and State,</hi> as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>notions</hi> about <hi>the Kings Prerogative, Liberty, Propriety, the Original of Government, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge, Will-worship, the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Church, Holy-dayes, Superstition, Scandal,</hi> &amp;c. Which
<pb facs="tcp:49587:9"/>
according to his <hi>explication</hi> (who to say the truth, speaks out all) the <hi>Covenanters</hi> were more wary, then professedly to own. Now I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, there is no Reason why <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,</hi> because they are, in a Book, wrote in <hi>defence</hi> of <hi>the Covenant</hi> should be <hi>priviledged</hi> from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation</hi>: this were to invest <hi>the Covenant</hi> in <hi>the Grave,</hi> with the same Power it exercised in <hi>the Throne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are <hi>two Reasons</hi> (Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) which I have prevented thee from <hi>using</hi>; which, had they seemed <hi>sufficient</hi> to One who is better able to <hi>judge</hi> then I, or possibly, thy self canst pretend to <hi>be,</hi> thou hadst missed of that <hi>sport,</hi> thou thinkest thy self to make with them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49587:10"/>Which yet I cannot deny, but that there is some ground of <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicion</hi> for; when I consider <hi>the practices</hi> of some in, and the <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi> (thence drawn) others <hi>have of,</hi> the <hi>Place</hi> I live in: For it may be thought first, That I write now <hi>against the Covenant,</hi> upon the same score in <hi>these times,</hi> upon which I would have wrote <hi>for it</hi> in <hi>others: Tenents</hi> as well as <hi>Cloths,</hi> changing with <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion.</hi> As to this, I only say this: Of those few that do know me, many can witness me to be <hi>innocent</hi> in this <hi>particular,</hi> even when they dare not say <hi>themselves have been so.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if not <hi>this,</hi> it may (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) be thought, that this is
<pb facs="tcp:49587:10"/>
a <hi>sage Contrivance</hi> of a <hi>sneaking Schollar,</hi> who being resolved to <hi>write</hi> against <hi>some body,</hi> chose one who <hi>durst not answer.</hi> I must confess this would have trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled me, had this been my <hi>first at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt:</hi> It is well known, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared as to the <hi>civil part</hi> (and to <hi>the Covenant,</hi> as it referred to <hi>that</hi>) when the Presse was open enough, since which, all Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> Books on <hi>that subject,</hi> have been writ.</p>
            <p>There was one thing more which <hi>diswaded</hi> me <hi>from,</hi> and <hi>hindered</hi> me <hi>in,</hi> the <hi>finishing</hi> this; and that alone would have me have <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,</hi> now it is done; which I to that end proposed to that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Person</hi> who engaged me
<pb facs="tcp:49587:11"/>
               <hi>in it, viz.</hi> A fear that it might <hi>displease</hi> the <hi>judicious Royalists,</hi> as being an occasion to multiply the number of (what is already too great) <hi>Seditious Pamphlets,</hi> it being not probable, that of those <hi>numerous Abettors</hi> of Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> and his <hi>cause</hi> he brags of, not <hi>one</hi> should offer to assert <hi>either.</hi> But I do assure all those worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, I received <hi>a Negative</hi> as to <hi>this</hi> too, from one, in <hi>whose judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> they would readily <hi>acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esce;</hi> and desired me to go on, for that <hi>the Times</hi> did require (what sure this <hi>Book</hi> did not) <hi>an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer</hi> to Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> This Book, I must confess, comes out <hi>late</hi> against <hi>the Covenant;</hi> I wish some men had <hi>more honesty,</hi> or <hi>lesse coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,</hi>

that this may be <hi>the last;</hi> or if not so, That there may never be need of other <hi>weapons,</hi> besides <hi>Pens</hi> against it.

               <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Ither <hi>the Covenant</hi> is in its sense <hi>as Loyal,</hi> and in its obligation <hi>as indispensable</hi> as it is at present thought <hi>convenient</hi> to be asserted; or, it is <hi>not.</hi> If not; why is there such a do made about that, which if in any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of <hi>affairs,</hi> certainly in <hi>these,</hi> obligeth not?

Sure I am, the very <hi>Covenanters</hi> thrived by <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Oaths</hi> and <hi>practises.</hi> Sure I am, that <hi>whole party,</hi> (very, very few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars excepted) have been such <hi>base complyers with,</hi> nay <hi>flatterers of,</hi> every thing, but their <hi>lawful Prince</hi>; take

as <hi>unworthy conditions</hi> from an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Power,</hi> as themselves would fain have <hi>imposed</hi> upon <hi>the one only lawful one.</hi> That they have <hi>discovered</hi> hitherto no other <hi>use</hi> of their <hi>consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> but in <hi>scrupling</hi> at <hi>things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,</hi> and that too, when it brought along with it <hi>gain</hi> and <hi>credit.</hi> Be turned out of a <hi>Benefice</hi> of 30 <hi>l.</hi> a year, when to be <hi>a silenced Minister</hi> was worth a 100. The instances of other <hi>sufferers</hi> are not very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; nor when <hi>tryal</hi> comes to be made, will, I suppose, be. Where was their <hi>Allegiance</hi> to King <hi>Charles</hi> in Queen <hi>Richards</hi> dayes? Him they courted upon these two accounts, He was <hi>an Usurper,</hi> and so obliged to <hi>secure</hi> them in other <hi>mens estates, Qualis Rex, talis Grex.</hi> And second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he was <hi>an easie fool,</hi> and so apt to be <hi>ruled</hi> by <hi>crafty Knaves.</hi> Nor did they trouble Him with <hi>their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>; because they were <hi>sure</hi> to <hi>enjoy</hi> what they <hi>intended by it,</hi> viz.
<pb facs="tcp:49587:13"/>
               <hi>other mens Estates:</hi> No matter for <hi>the Scotch Government,</hi> when without it they can <hi>securely</hi> keep <hi>English Livings.</hi> Nor was it of any great Concern to have this Church <hi>reformed</hi> according to their <hi>principles,</hi> when <hi>the best endowed Churches</hi> were <hi>reformed</hi> into their possession. He who endeavours to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade me to an <hi>Oath,</hi> himself in cases of <hi>danger</hi> or <hi>profit</hi> broke, takes me a <hi>Fool,</hi> and engages me to take him for a <hi>Knave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the <hi>Covenant</hi> be a <hi>National Obligation,</hi> obliging <hi>all,</hi> even those who took it not, as well as those who took it, and <hi>Posterity</hi> into the bargain, (as Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> in the sixth Section throughout) none are more <hi>guilty</hi> than those who <hi>imposed</hi> and <hi>asserted</hi> it, because none have acted more contrary to it, according to that <hi>loyal sense</hi> which is now put on it. The truth is, it is penned so <hi>ambiguously,</hi> that (like their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences</hi>)
<pb facs="tcp:49587:14"/>
it might suit <hi>all times.</hi> They swear in the third Article [<hi>To preserve the Kings Person and Authority, &amp;c.</hi>] By preserving the <hi>Kings person,</hi> their <hi>practice</hi> teaches me to understand <hi>preserve,</hi> i. e. <hi>keep safe</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> i. e. <hi>in custody,</hi> i. e. <hi>in Prison:</hi> As for his <hi>Authority,</hi> that was <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served</hi> too; where, as things then stood, they could have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent it should have been <hi>continued:</hi> That they would have preserved <hi>the Kings Authority,</hi> I shall not deny but in <hi>whose hands</hi> let themselves speak. They told us pretty fair at the beginning of the <hi>War,</hi> See 19 <hi>Propositions:</hi> All the Kings <hi>Privy Council</hi> to be approved by them, take such an <hi>Oath</hi> as they pleased; so likewise <hi>the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, Iudges, the Steward,</hi> &amp;c. all the great <hi>publique Officers</hi>; so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>Peers,</hi> the whole <hi>Militia</hi> at their disposal, and the marriage of <hi>the Kings Children,</hi> all who had stood for <hi>the King,</hi> to be at the
<pb facs="tcp:49587:14"/>
mercy of <hi>the Parliament.</hi> Their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proposals were much at the rate of these, I therefore pass them over all, and so I shall their <hi>Votes</hi> of <hi>Non-Addresse,</hi> with their <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> upon them, because <hi>shame</hi> hath made them buy them all up, so that upon ordinary enquiry they are not to be had, and themselves revoked them when they knew not well how to help it, but were fain to make a vertue of <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Spite,</hi> and call it <hi>Loyalty,</hi> at the <hi>Isle</hi> of <hi>Wight-Treaty,</hi> where the <hi>Kings Party</hi> must be first acknowledged <hi>guilty</hi> of the <hi>blood shed</hi> in the War, in the <hi>Preface,</hi> and accordingly treated in the <hi>Articles; the Militia, Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, Officers, &amp;c.</hi> all in them solely for twenty years, all <hi>Peers</hi> made by the <hi>King</hi> since <hi>the Great Seal</hi> went to him, null; their <hi>Great Seal</hi> appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with much more to be seen in the <hi>Articles:</hi> And after all this, for fear some <hi>Regalia,</hi> some
<pb facs="tcp:49587:15"/>
               <hi>shadow</hi> of <hi>Authority</hi> should have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaped their <hi>observation,</hi> they only Voted <hi>his Concessions a fit ground for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishing a peace,</hi> so that if they could think of any thing else which looked like <hi>Authority,</hi> they were resolved to have it, for the <hi>Agreement</hi> was only <hi>begun,</hi> not <hi>made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to <hi>the Kings Person,</hi> I do not finde they can acquit themselves much better; I very well know, that in <hi>the actual cutting off the Kings Head,</hi> and some other <hi>attendant violences,</hi> the Army did not suffer the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian party</hi> to have the whole share of <hi>the benefit</hi>: but I suppose that will not free them from the whole share of the <hi>guilt</hi>; except, when two joyn in an <hi>unlawfull design,</hi> he who is <hi>outwitted,</hi> is presently <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, I enquire, whose <hi>Army</hi> it was? who <hi>raised</hi> them, furnisht them with <hi>opportunity</hi> (not at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to say, <hi>Principles</hi>?) Had there
<pb facs="tcp:49587:15"/>
been no more, they could not have been easily acquitted; for a man is responsible for the <hi>consequents</hi> of his <hi>unwarrantable actions,</hi> especially if they are foretold, and he will not desist: In that case he can scarce say, He did not intend those <hi>conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,</hi> not at all pretend he did not <hi>produce</hi> them.</p>
            <p>In our Law, if a man in his <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full calling,</hi> doth an act, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his <hi>intent</hi> or <hi>knowledge,</hi> by which a man is unawares to him <hi>killed,</hi> the <hi>punishment</hi> is <hi>severe,</hi> though <hi>morally</hi> he cannot be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to help it: As <hi>a Mason</hi> throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>stones</hi> or <hi>timber</hi> from the top of a House, a <hi>Man</hi> going by, by chance is <hi>killed</hi>; but if such a Man doth such an act out of his <hi>Calling,</hi> it is <hi>Death,</hi> and that <hi>deservedly</hi>: So the <hi>two Houses,</hi> had they professed <hi>no hostility</hi> to <hi>the King,</hi> they not being in <hi>their employment,</hi> the power of <hi>the Sword</hi> not at all being by our
<pb facs="tcp:49587:16"/>
               <hi>Lawes</hi> vested in them, nor can they make out which way they came by, or who gave them, that <hi>Authority</hi>; whatever is the <hi>consequent</hi> of their so doing, they are guilty of it, be it what it will: And truly it is reasonable, that they who will <hi>usurp employment,</hi> should be <hi>obliged</hi> to see <hi>the Ills</hi> of it not to be greater than those which before perhaps they did but <hi>fancy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He who forces me out of the <hi>secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and by <hi>violence</hi> confines me to <hi>another protection,</hi> is obliged to see that that be not <hi>less.</hi> And this would have been so, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>the King</hi> to have had <hi>the rights</hi> barely of <hi>a private person</hi>: He who without <hi>authority</hi> of <hi>Law,</hi> but solely upon the grounds (<hi>real</hi> or <hi>imaginary</hi>) of <hi>expediency,</hi> will <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, enrage,</hi> and <hi>arm</hi> men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, and after their having made them my <hi>mortal Enemies,</hi> make them my <hi>Life-guard,</hi> commit
<pb facs="tcp:49587:16"/>
my <hi>life</hi> to the keeping of those, themselves had often represented me to, as not <hi>fit</hi> to <hi>live</hi>; he before <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> is answerable for my <hi>life,</hi> without whom those others could have had neither <hi>power,</hi> nor <hi>pretence,</hi> nor, in all probability, would have <hi>a will</hi> to take my <hi>life</hi> from me.</p>
            <p>But (alas) how small a part of the <hi>Presbyterian Parliaments</hi> guilt is this, from whom they received not only <hi>opportunity,</hi> but <hi>principles</hi> and <hi>example?</hi> They not only <hi>enabled,</hi> but <hi>taught</hi> the Army by <hi>doctrine</hi> and <hi>practice.</hi> Imprisoning <hi>the King,</hi> our <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>common sense</hi> too, calls <hi>compassing his Death</hi>: For in that case, <hi>his life,</hi> as to the <hi>publique,</hi> can be nothing but a capacity of <hi>taking away</hi> theirs, and they all that while are in a fair probability of being <hi>hanged.</hi> After the <hi>imprisonment</hi> of <hi>a King,</hi> suppose him like to <hi>escape,</hi> and head <hi>a numerous party,</hi> did he
<pb facs="tcp:49587:17"/>
not deserve to be farther <hi>proceeded</hi> against? and would not their <hi>own security</hi> require it? Would they have ever restored <hi>the King</hi> to the Exercise of <hi>any power,</hi> till he had assented to what they should please or no? If no, I desire to know first what <hi>the Army</hi> did more then that? Secondly, what <hi>a King</hi> he were, who had nothing to do in <hi>the Government,</hi> but only <hi>gro<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n</hi> under it? And thirdly, why may not they who have <hi>Authority</hi> to depose <hi>a King,</hi> and have <hi>just grounds, viz</hi> the <hi>security</hi> of the <hi>publique,</hi> may not for the <hi>assurance</hi> of that <hi>security,</hi> put him to <hi>death.</hi> If they would have restored <hi>the King,</hi> though he had not <hi>tamely</hi> said <hi>Yes</hi> to every Demand, yielded his <hi>Crown</hi> to save his <hi>Head,</hi> let them say so for shame, if they can.</p>
            <p>What they did, and owned from the beginning, and it may be too justly concluded from the <hi>no remorse</hi> we finde in them, would <hi>own again,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49587:17"/>
were it not for <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>shame,</hi> will justifie <hi>the Army</hi> from any thing but being their <hi>servants,</hi> who <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,</hi> and only <hi>acted</hi> their <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</hi> In the first Reason for <hi>a War, [The King was but a Trustee, and had broken his trust, which ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Dissolution of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.]</hi> That was fair to begin with, [<hi>Tended to,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>i. e.</hi> The relation of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Subjects</hi> was fairly going, and why, if but <hi>a Trustee,</hi> and the <hi>Trust broken,</hi> it may not be <hi>re-seized</hi>; I could almost tell them, I see no <hi>cause:</hi> Sure it would suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently shew their <hi>intentions</hi> in case of <hi>the King,</hi> but not at all better their own <hi>claim</hi>: I would not have <hi>the House of Commons</hi> triumph too soon; because, as is very evident, they had <hi>received</hi> their <hi>whole power</hi> and <hi>trust</hi>; so <hi>both,</hi> in the Judgement of him who <hi>called</hi> them, and those who <hi>sent</hi> them, they had basely <hi>betrayed</hi> it.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>the King</hi> was not <hi>King</hi> in his <hi>personal,</hi> but <hi>political capacity,
<pb facs="tcp:49587:18"/>
i. e.</hi> themselves, against whom therefore to <hi>wage War</hi> was <hi>Treason,</hi> according to this, the cutting off <hi>the Kings Head</hi> cannot be <hi>Treason.</hi> I shall not deal farther in this, but only desire all those of them who would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade themselves of their own <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,</hi> that they are at least thus far concerned, that they employed and empowered those men, who but for them, never would have been able to <hi>accomplish,</hi> nor in all likelihood to <hi>contrive</hi> that <hi>black Act</hi>; and that after <hi>the King</hi> had often by <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>convincing Arguments</hi> shewed it to be the <hi>necessary result</hi> of their <hi>principles</hi> and <hi>proceedings</hi>: And truely <hi>the Army</hi> were almost obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, in their own defence to pull down <hi>the King</hi> and <hi>Lawes,</hi> they had so much offended, that they could scarce <hi>hope</hi> for <hi>pardon,</hi> nor at all be secured of it, <hi>the King</hi> being once restored, any farther then they were assured of <hi>the Kings</hi> regard to <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49587:18"/>
and <hi>Conscience,</hi> a thing the <hi>two Houses</hi> had very unworthily often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be <hi>none at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot but observe how <hi>the Parliament</hi> thought to order the <hi>King,</hi> by employing such men as would doe their work <hi>throughly.</hi> They could not in discretion trust <hi>the King,</hi> but could <hi>an Army,</hi> and so betrayed themselves with a great deal of <hi>warinesse,</hi> as it is very ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary for men to ruine their own <hi>Interest</hi> by preferring it before their <hi>Duty</hi>: And in that case the question is this, Who knowes what is fittest to be done, <hi>God</hi> who <hi>commanded this,</hi> or <hi>themselves</hi> who <hi>contrived that</hi>: And sure it cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise expected, but that God should <hi>declare</hi> those who take upon them to be <hi>wiser</hi> then him, to be <hi>very Fools.</hi> But in our case, they did not more sacrifice their <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Allegiance</hi> to <hi>Craft</hi> and <hi>Interest,</hi> then they did sacrifice that <hi>Craft</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49587:19"/>
and <hi>Interest</hi> to <hi>Passion</hi> and <hi>Humour</hi>; and truely it frequently happens, that they who change <hi>Government,</hi> do neither <hi>mend</hi> it as to the <hi>Peoples</hi> advantage, nor <hi>enjoy</hi> it as to their own. The chief Instruments of <hi>prosperous Rebellion,</hi> are usually the <hi>Avengers</hi> of it, at once <hi>expound</hi> and <hi>chastise</hi> the <hi>vice,</hi> set up a <hi>power</hi> which is indeed <hi>Arbitrary</hi> both in the <hi>rules</hi> and <hi>exercise</hi> of it, when that they had pulled down one, which was only <hi>called</hi> so, it fared so with us. The people had as little need to be fond of their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots,</hi> as they of their <hi>Army</hi>: Neither of us have cause to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of any but our selves: It was just with God to permit us our <hi>ruine,</hi> when we were <hi>fond</hi> of it, that after we had complained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>a cause,</hi> we should have <hi>cause</hi> to complain.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>People</hi> both say they were <hi>unhappy,</hi> let us see

            </p>
            <p>The two next Paragraphs are proofs of what the University pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses not to be convinced of; the encrease of the Rage, Power, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of the enemies of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing encreased in the sense intended, which were, <hi>The troubles the three Kingdoms were at present in, the</hi> Spanish Armado, <hi>the Gun-powder Treason, the Colledge of</hi> Propagators, Cuneus <hi>his plot discovered to Sir</hi> Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Boswel, <hi>and by him to Archbishop</hi> Laud, <hi>laid open in</hi> Romes <hi>Masterpiece.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49587:23"/>First, I observe by this and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Treatises referred to, (particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, <hi>The Soveraign Power of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments</hi>; wrote, as Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> sayes, solidly by Mr. <hi>Prynn,</hi> and some will not stick to say, as solidly by him since confuted) it is too apparent, That <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> those I mean who plead for <hi>the Covenant,</hi> want nothing but <hi>Opportunity</hi> to play over their <hi>old Game.</hi> Contending so earnestly for old <hi>Premises,</hi> can be nothing but an earnest desire to infer the same <hi>Conclusion.</hi> Me-thinks they should not desire the King to forget what themselves will not. But all this is far from proving the Rage, Presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the enemies of God to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased <hi>in the int<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nded sense,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears thus:</p>
            <p>The Covenant was made against that Party the King headed: who, for those and such like Reasons, were the [<hi>Open enemies</hi>] Which name they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served either because <hi>they</hi> propagated
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49587:24"/>
Popery, or because <hi>others</hi> did it. The latter will not (though practised) be <hi>asserted</hi>; nor the former <hi>proved.</hi> First, I hope the old Plots, the <hi>Spanish Armado,</hi> the Gun-powder Treason, do not evince the King and his Party, to have been Popish: and for that later one of <hi>Cuneus,</hi> that it was disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Archbishop, is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration at <hi>Oxon.</hi> that he drove it on. If the Archbishop was a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist, I would willingly be resolved, whether the Jesuite <hi>Fisher</hi> was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Scotch Service Book,</hi> is an argument much used by those, who never saw, or least considered it. Retaining Formes and Ceremonies used in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which were Ancient, Useful, and Innocent, is of great use: as to demonstrate our conformity with the Primitive Church; and to convince <hi>Rome,</hi> we would not leave her, but where she left her self. Which is to prove our
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49587:24"/>
               <hi>Reformation</hi> to be the result of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Conscience, not Spite and Humour. Nor is this an evidence of, but a bar from, our return to <hi>Rome</hi>; For they who will not separate but upon, and no farther then there are, weighty Causes; are not like to return till those weighty Causes are remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: whereas they who separate in an Humour, may in a Humour unite again. Nay, they who are but part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guilty; who will abstain from acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons otherwise innocent, because some they think ill of use them, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge themselves guilty of separating more then there is cause for: that is, as I understand it, out of <hi>Spite,</hi> be the name it bears never so solemn. A deportment, <hi>Christians</hi> (of all men in the world) much more <hi>Christian Churches,</hi> should not use one toward another.</p>
            <p>To Object our readiness to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Rome</hi> upon so incompetent a ground, at the best was <hi>Weakness:</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:49587:25"/>
but to Object it <hi>now,</hi> when all those, the ruine of whom this Book en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devours, have been resolute examples of our averseness from <hi>Rome,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the sore temptations which (by means of this <hi>Covenant</hi>) they have been exercised with, can be nothing but <hi>Malice.</hi> Unless we will suppose, that those, who would not part with a good cause, when God seems to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake it; should throw it away, now he appears to own it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They tendred a Cardinals cap to the Archbishop.</hi> It is no new trick, to be rid of a most dangerous adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to make him suspected, and so not used, by his own party. <hi>Hannibal</hi> quickly understood <hi>Fabius,</hi> and as quickly foresaw his own speedy ruin, unless the <hi>Romans</hi> discarded that <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</hi> The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> could not <hi>beat</hi> him: therefore he was so maliciously kind to him, as not to injure him. The silly vulgar suspected, and the crafty knaves proclaimed him, to be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49587:25"/>
of <hi>Hannibals:</hi> Nor was that errour discovered till there was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to repent it. <hi>Timeo Danaos vel dona ferentes.</hi> Had there been lesse ability and resolution to oppose <hi>Rome</hi> in that <hi>head,</hi> it might in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity have stood longer upon its own <hi>shoulders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> wonders at that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression [<hi>In the intended sense</hi>] with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which words the <hi>Oxf.</hi> men would never have denyed the Rage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the enemies of God, and Religion to be at that time encreased: because they saw and felt it. And truly on which side they were, Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> shall wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, even where he is professedly handling the Argument, p. 28. <hi>Who abetted the murther of the late King.</hi> Which Army did that, needs no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute. Who <hi>commissioned</hi> the men that did that; furnished them with Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and opportunity; in prosecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of whose avowed Declarations and Resolves, that Act might be
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49587:26"/>
justified: The men of <hi>Oxf.</hi> saw then as clearly, as all the World do easily now. If the Kings death was, as Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> urges, a design of the Papists; the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and the <hi>Royal Party</hi> were not sure their only Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors. You see, Sir, one may believe the presumption of <hi>the enemies of God,</hi> to have been at that time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased; and yet, not in that sense. That <hi>Papists</hi> rejoyced at our Troubles is granted: and withal, that they have not at all discovered their <hi>sorrow</hi> (their <hi>joy</hi> they have) that this Covenant pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down that Church, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by strength of Arguments and Armies, could not do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oxf.</hi> Second Reason is,</p>
            <p>They could not truly say, <hi>That they had used or given consent to any Supplication or Remonstrance to the purpose therein expressed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The force of this is plainly thus, They durst not swear they had done
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49587:26"/>
what they knew they never did. To which Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> p. 29. <hi>Had not they Representees in Parliament? did they give No to such Supplications? or, if they did, were they not carryed by the major Vote? and is not the Negative swallowed therein, that all persons and bodies Corporate did thereunto consent?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This a strange piece of sense. Whatever the Parliament upon other mens Supplications Vote, though of such a nature as many men from their very souls abhor the thought of; it is for that sole reason true, that they supplicated for it: and they may swear it, though they know they did not. On the other side, I conceive I may be bound to <hi>submit</hi> to many Laws, as proceeding from a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Authority, which I may truly affirm I neither did, nor was at all bound to <hi>desire.</hi> Had the Parliament, when they first voted <hi>No-Addresse,</hi> in 1647. Voted the Kings death,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49587:27"/>
(which they might have done by the same law of Reason, nor could their ablest defenders ever answer <hi>Goodwin</hi> and others upon that Head) did every man in <hi>England</hi> therefore supplicate for it? But for Him we need not be sollicitous, seeing at the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the War, he was declared but a Trustee, who had shamefully betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Trust, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if this Logick be good, there is a worse story behind, even this <hi>Blessed Covenant</hi> hath lost its ablest defendor, (not to say at one blow it hath lost them all,) seeing <hi>the Parliament</hi> have voted the Covenant burnt: and Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> himself may swear he hath supplicated for it. Sure he will finde a way to evade this special piece of Law so applyed. That by <hi>the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> all Persons and Towns Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate did consent; that in things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to their cognisance, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority concludes the whole House, and they the Nation; I believe true and account it reasonable. But
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49587:27"/>
Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> good friend Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> tells us another story, and endeavours to prove it in the enlargement of his 179. Thesis, of the Efficient and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying causes of Power, <hi>p.</hi> 185, 186. <hi>The Minor part,</hi> if it be the better and wiser, are not concluded; and if they have any advantage as strength, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they may use it. I suppose that he thinks with <hi>the Minor,</hi> he will perswade them, who will be not unapt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it of themselves, that they are the wiser and better.</p>
            <p>The next thing considerable is, <hi>p.</hi> 30. an answer to the fourth Reason: which is, that they apprehended it not to be according to the Commendable practise of these Kingdoms, or the example of Gods people in other Nations; nay, the Defenders tels us, <hi>The world never saw the like before.</hi> To which M. <hi>Cr.</hi> tels us, <hi>That Israel did in the dayes of Ioash, Iosiah,</hi> &amp;c. The only difference is, in short, one of the greatest reasons, for which this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49587:28"/>
was expresly and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refused and refuted: <hi>Those</hi> were with, <hi>This</hi> expresly against, him in whom that Obligatory Power lay, the Prince.</p>
            <p>In his Reconciling these words with those of Mr. <hi>Nye,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> grants what is abundantly enough to prove what he denies [<hi>That for Matter, Persons, and other Circumstances, the like had not been in Any age or Oath we read of in Sacred or Profane Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>]. Whence I thus argue, If there is so much in this Covenant distinct from what was ever in any before, and that so considerable, as to make a distinct Argument to commend this Covenant to the world, more then any other ever could pretend to; <hi>That for Matter and Persons,</hi> i. e. The <hi>thing sworn,</hi> and <hi>persons swearing,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides other circumstances, there had never been the like before. It is not imaginable this should be warranted by former examples, when neither
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49587:28"/>
in <hi>Matter</hi> nor <hi>Persons,</hi> the <hi>thing sworn,</hi> or <hi>persons swearing,</hi> besides other <hi>attendant circumstances, the like had ever been before.</hi> It seems it was done after, and warranted by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of a thing nothing like it.</p>

               <p>But besides the general unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness of such courses; the <hi>Oxf.</hi> men render several Reasons peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly relating to Themselves and that Cause. As first, <hi>That as it did not concern them to have much, so they
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49587:29"/>
professed to have very little understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it.</hi> Which, though Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> is pleased to <hi>wonder at</hi>; another man possibly may not at all think it <hi>strange,</hi> that wise-men should not trouble themselves with what did not <hi>concern</hi> them. When he sayes, <hi>They should know as much as all the Nation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides</hi>; I desire to know <hi>his opinion</hi> of those Gentlemen who came into <hi>their places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next thing of moment is, <hi>p.</hi> 42. in answer to the <hi>Fourth Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>; where, the <hi>Oxf.</hi> men find in <hi>Scotland, several things tending to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Superstition and Schism</hi>; as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting <hi>Bishops Antichristian,</hi> and <hi>Indifferent Ceremonies unlawfull.</hi> Where, first, he catcheth at those Phrases, <hi>tending toward</hi>; and, <hi>to our thinking</hi>: where he triumphs thus, <hi>Me-thinks, Superstition and Schisme should be so well known at</hi> Oxf. <hi>that they might be able to conclude what things tend thereunto.</hi> Modesty of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49587:30"/>
Expression, is no more a sign of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi>; then Bold peremptoriness, is an infallible evidence of <hi>Knowledg.</hi> When St. <hi>Paul</hi> sayes, <hi>I Think, I have the Spirit of God</hi>; should a witty Sophister retort, <hi>What? the great Apostle of the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>who magnifies so his Office, but</hi> Think, <hi>he should know whether he hath the Spirit, or no?</hi> Nay, this grave Corrector, in this very place, useth the <hi>same expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> he carps at, <hi>Me-thinks, Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Charge is this, They account <hi>Bishops Antichristian,</hi> and <hi>Indifferent Ceremonies unlawful,</hi> and make <hi>their Discipline a Mark of the true Church,</hi> and <hi>the setting up thereof the ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the Throne of Iesus Christ.</hi> There is but one way to excuse this from <hi>Schism,</hi> and that too many <hi>Non-conformists</hi> have taken, which is to say, They do not <hi>divide from a Church</hi>; because, where these <hi>fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> are not <hi>received,</hi> there are <hi>no
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49587:30"/>
Churches</hi>; not considering, they have by that means <hi>un-Churched all the World,</hi> that any History gives an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of. And that for so many <hi>ages,</hi> that if this be true, <hi>the gates of hell pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed against the Church,</hi> as soon as themselves can <hi>pretend</hi> it made <hi>the first attempt.</hi> But this Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> would willingly salve. <hi>They give Assemblies Authority about Ceremonies,</hi> ergo, <hi>do not deem Indifferent Ceremonies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</hi> If so, <hi>Ceremonies</hi> not <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> in the Word of God may be <hi>enjoyned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They make Discipline rightly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred, as is prescribed in the Word of God, the Note of a true Church, but do not appropriate it unto theirs.</hi> Either <hi>their Discipline</hi> is <hi>prescribed</hi> in the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>not.</hi> If <hi>not</hi>; they did well to swear and fight down <hi>Ours,</hi> for not <hi>being</hi> in <hi>the Word of God</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, to make way for another, which it self is not <hi>there.</hi> If it be <hi>there prescribed,</hi> and yet this Title

[<hi>Prescribed in the Word of God, which is the Note of a true Church</hi>] be not <hi>appropriate</hi> to it, but may <hi>belong</hi> to another; and that which either is not in <hi>the Word of God,</hi> which is <hi>the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer inconvenience</hi>; or, which is in <hi>the Word of God</hi> as well as <hi>theirs</hi>: and then there be two several Disciplines prescribed in the Word of God. A Doctrine, I suppose, our <hi>Scotch</hi>-Masters would not once have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They deem indeed English-Popish-Ceremonies unlawful; but deny them to be Indifferent,</hi> p. 43.</p>
               <p>Are they <hi>unlawful</hi> because used in <hi>Popish-Churches,</hi> or for any other Reason? If for any other Reason; that should have been <hi>expressed,</hi> or at least <hi>intimated,</hi> so as we might have guessed at it. If for that reason alone, (as seems, being <hi>alone alledged,</hi> The appellation, <hi>Popish</hi>:) I do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, how another mans <hi>using a thing,</hi> can make it <hi>unlawful</hi> for me to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49587:31"/>
                  <hi>use it.</hi> For <hi>sin</hi> is nothing else but <hi>the transgression of a Law.</hi> What then, by the <hi>laws of God,</hi> and my <hi>just Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours</hi> is not <hi>prohibited me</hi>; it is not imaginable, how a <hi>Heathen, Turk, Iew,</hi> or (which some make worse) a <hi>Papist,</hi> can by <hi>doing it</hi> make <hi>it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful</hi> for me to <hi>do.</hi> For seeing the Laws of God and Man have <hi>left it free</hi>; he or I, either or both, in <hi>doing such a thing</hi> do but use our <hi>indulged Liberty,</hi> that which is <hi>left free</hi> for us to do. Now, how it comes to pass, That his <hi>using</hi> his <hi>lawful liberty,</hi> should <hi>deprive</hi> me of mine, I would gladly know. The Question seems to me this, How it can be <hi>criminal</hi> in me, to <hi>imitate</hi> other men (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>Papists,</hi> whom, I hope, I may reckon <hi>Men</hi>) in those cases in which they are <hi>confessedly Innocent?</hi> for so, in this present Case, <hi>Papists</hi> confessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are; seeing they <hi>transgress</hi> no <hi>law</hi> of <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Man.</hi> For had it been otherwise; not its <hi>being used by Papists,</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:49587:32"/>
but <hi>the law,</hi> against which <hi>the action is,</hi> should have been <hi>urged</hi> as the Reason of the <hi>sin of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Iews,</hi> who <hi>crucified</hi> Christ in <hi>his person,</hi> and <hi>persecuted</hi> Him in <hi>his members,</hi> were certainly as <hi>great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> to Christ, as <hi>Papists</hi> can in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty be supposed to be. Yet, St. <hi>Paul</hi> (whose trade was not to <hi>gain</hi> by <hi>Factions</hi>) would do <hi>actions</hi> upon that very score, to be <hi>like them</hi>; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with them <hi>in Ceremonies</hi> which he knew to be abolished. <hi>To the Iew he became a Iew</hi> in that sort. I know it is said, He did it <hi>to win over the Iews,</hi> and it is not likely we should <hi>win over the Papists.</hi> A Discourse dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not by <hi>Reason,</hi> but <hi>Malice,</hi> which makes it <hi>blind,</hi> and (the blow missing its Adversary) throws it self. St. <hi>Paul</hi> was far from being <hi>ignorant</hi> how <hi>the spirit of obduration,</hi> was in a very great measure gone out upon <hi>that People</hi>; he yet durst not omit all <hi>possible condescension.</hi> Their being
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49587:32"/>
                  <hi>stubborn,</hi> was no warrant to Him to be <hi>morose.</hi> To <hi>endeavour</hi> was his <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and he did it. What <hi>use</hi> they would make of it, he left <hi>to them</hi>; what <hi>effect</hi> it should have, <hi>to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His last <hi>Salvo,</hi> is <hi>p.</hi> 44. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction between <hi>verè</hi> and <hi>vera Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia.</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> do not <hi>un-church</hi> all others for want of their Discipline, <hi>Because a True Church is opposed to a Corrupt, as well as falsly consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I demand here, <hi>Whether a Church may be a Church of Christ without the Scotch-Discipline, or no?</hi> If <hi>No,</hi> the Distinction is <hi>impertinent</hi>; not to say, crafty: serving to hide their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, till there is opportunity of discovering it. If <hi>it may,</hi> then there was no need of <hi>a Covenant</hi> and <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending-violences</hi> to force in <hi>that,</hi> without which we may be <hi>a Church of Christ</hi>; and so, without it, <hi>The Lord might have dwelt among us,</hi> as
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49587:33"/>
the phrase of the Covenant is. Or if, for all that Grant, it is yet <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to bring that <hi>Discipline in,</hi> in such a manner; then it is not enough to be <hi>a Church of Christ,</hi> unlesse we be <hi>a Church of Scotland too</hi>: and <hi>Wars</hi> are necessary, not only till a Church is <hi>a true one</hi>; but till every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth it <hi>the best imaginable.</hi> Atenent, the Army raised upon the score of <hi>this Covenant</hi>; and learnt it so well, that they quickly taught their <hi>Scotch-masters</hi> the meaning and consequents of it.</p>
               <p>The second ground of the <hi>Oxf.</hi> mens Refusal, is, They are not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, <hi>How they can swear to reform the Doctrine, Discipline,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Because it cannot be changed without mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest scandal to the Papist and Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratist.</hi>

But, because they name another Rule, It is plain, they mean <hi>to alter that too</hi>; and, so are lyable to those inconveniencies Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to free them from, by a strained Interpretation, which their <hi>words</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> are no way capable of. Though it is a pretty strange ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of bringing <hi>Englands established Religion</hi> to <hi>the Scotish mode,</hi> by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations out of Authors, which are contended for, to be no part of <hi>that Religion so established.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> doth indeed set several <hi>Doctrines,</hi> and name <hi>Authors,</hi> many of which have been eminently useful to this <hi>Church,</hi> and therefore hated by <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Scotland:</hi> but being there are no <hi>references</hi> to any part of their <hi>Works</hi>; with <hi>what sincerity</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:49587:38"/>
it is done, <hi>I am not able to say:</hi> But I may guess it to be done with <hi>very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> if I may conclude by one which I single out: because that sort of people have so <hi>little shame</hi> or <hi>conscience</hi> as to Preach it down to the people as <hi>Arminianism.</hi> It is p. 47. <hi>That men had free will of themselves to believe and repent</hi> he may justly say, <hi>The Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity</hi> was poysoned with <hi>Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,</hi> if this horrid Tenent was owned and there countenanced. <hi>Arminians</hi> need not be angry, that they are <hi>slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered</hi>; for that is a tacit Confession: there is not <hi>truth</hi> enough to object against them. Men must <hi>bely</hi> them, to make them <hi>odious</hi>; part with their <hi>own Innocency</hi> to <hi>darken theirs.</hi> But I much wonder Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> should tell the Masters of <hi>Oxf.</hi> That, <hi>This Tenent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others was defended by them from censure.</hi> Though people are apt to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> any thing of <hi>Papists</hi> &amp; <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>; yet the <hi>Oxf.</hi> men are not so apt to <hi>believe</hi> any story <hi>of themselves.</hi> They <hi>challenge</hi> all the world to tell <hi>when,</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:49587:39"/>
and by <hi>whom</hi> they defended that horrid Doctrine from <hi>censure.</hi> The utmost ground of this <hi>accusation,</hi> is, some men in <hi>Oxf.</hi> might possibly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, they understood not what it was to be made <hi>willing</hi> whether <hi>we would or no</hi>; how <hi>freedom</hi> and <hi>force, liberty</hi> and <hi>necessi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ation,</hi> were the same thing. This is far enough from the purpose. But <hi>censure</hi> is there <hi>a judicial word.</hi> I demand therefore, Whether the University defended the men he means from <hi>the censure of these who had authority to censure them</hi>; or from <hi>those who had nothing to do in the matter.</hi> If from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, I desire to know, How it was possible for them to <hi>do it,</hi> and when they <hi>did it?</hi> If from the later, those who had nothing to do with it; sure the <hi>harm</hi> is not great.</p>
               <p>If I should grant all the <hi>Tenents</hi> he reckons up to be <hi>false,</hi> because it were perhaps too hard to <hi>prove</hi> them so to one who would <hi>deny</hi> it; I do
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49587:39"/>
not apprehend the considerable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage he would get by it toward <hi>his Cause,</hi> because they are only <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular mens.</hi> He will not sure think himself concerned in all we can prove preached in <hi>Camp,</hi> and <hi>City,</hi> and the men not only defended against the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Laws</hi>; but encouraged, applauded, and preferred. Might not men safely preach at <hi>London, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers</hi> to <hi>be above all Ordinances,</hi> but <hi>those of the two Houses.</hi> Was any more care taken at <hi>London</hi> (even when <hi>the Covenant</hi> was Triumphant, and set up in Churches instead of <hi>the Lords Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Ten Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements</hi>) of what Opinions men were of, any more then of what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, if they would but <hi>fight</hi> against <hi>the King?</hi> Was there any <hi>Heresie,</hi> but <hi>Loyalty?</hi> or <hi>Common Enemy,</hi> but <hi>the King?</hi> Might not those take the Scripture <hi>in any</hi> or <hi>no sense,</hi> who would take <hi>the Laws</hi> in <hi>equitable sense?</hi> It is altogether as reasonable
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49587:40"/>
to pull down <hi>Presbytery,</hi> because there were <hi>Independents</hi> in <hi>the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Army</hi>; as they to <hi>Covenant</hi> us into <hi>the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> Scotland, because some men preached what <hi>their ablest Defender</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges no part of <hi>the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England. And this is equal, <hi>supposing</hi> those Doctrines <hi>false,</hi> which as yet are only said to be so.</p>
               <p>But at last comes an Attempt to answer those <hi>Arguments,</hi> the force of which Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> hath hitherto evaded by pretences, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> I have proved (and perhaps himself perceived) ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less. <hi>It will not</hi> (saith he, p. 49.) <hi>justifie the Recusancy of the Papists, because these things were never a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>answer</hi> is none at all: because, if <hi>those things</hi> to which <hi>their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> was required were <hi>really sins,</hi> we cannot at all <hi>blame,</hi> nor <hi>justly punish them</hi> for refusing to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers <hi>in them</hi>; It is not easie to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49587:40"/>
think of any thing which would more please them in, or justifie them for, <hi>disobeying our established Laws,</hi> than our proclaiming them thus to be <hi>grosly horrid,</hi> so apparently abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as there was an unavoidable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of using the worst of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, a <hi>Civil War</hi>; and the worst of dangers, <hi>hazarding our souls</hi> in the most suspicious of actions, <hi>the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our Prince</hi>; to remove them. It is from hence, (if this be once granted,) clear, we have all along <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished Papists,</hi> for <hi>not conforming</hi> to what it is a Christians duty <hi>not to conform to.</hi> And this is, sure, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent ground for not assenting to this part of <hi>the Covenant</hi>; for, be the grounds of <hi>sinfulness what it will,</hi> our selves by this should own <hi>that to be sin</hi> which we punished them for <hi>not joyning in:</hi> the concession of which would be so pleasing to them, that I wonder to see those men <hi>plead</hi> for it, who make <hi>spite</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:49587:41"/>
to <hi>Rome</hi> the only <hi>rule</hi> they walk by.</p>
               <p>As to the second part of <hi>the scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,</hi> justifying <hi>the Separatists,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> answers not much better. p. 50. <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can such an acknowledgment justifie the Separatists: For, that the corruptions established, were never made such Essential parts of the Worship, as to make a sufficient ground for separation; and the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Non-conformists contended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst separation.</hi> This seems to me a very pretty Argumentation. There was no necessity to <hi>separate</hi> from <hi>the Church</hi> as it was <hi>by Law establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Discipline, Ceremonies, &amp;c.</hi> yet there was a necessity to pull it down [<hi>lest we be partakers of other mens sins, and so of their plagues,</hi> &amp;c.] with other such like phrases as <hi>the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> expresses it. Sure I am, if there was no sufficient ground for <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> there was no sufficient ground for <hi>a Covenant</hi> to reform in so <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49587:41"/>
a way</hi>; and, to pull down that <hi>Church,</hi> from which there was suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reason in your own judgement to <hi>separate.</hi> If, as you truly urge, <hi>Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour kept Communion with a Church much in need of Reformation, and taught men so to do</hi>; I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly learn, Who taught men to <hi>take up Arms,</hi> to destroy what you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be only such a Church. If there was no <hi>necessity</hi> for even those, who did not approve <hi>the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> to <hi>separate</hi>; as you do, and say <hi>the godly Non-conformists alwayes did</hi>: What ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable <hi>necessity</hi> could there be for these <hi>English</hi> men, who were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and the <hi>Scots</hi> strangers, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel by force <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> who approve of both, to <hi>swear</hi> it down.</p>
               <p>Now come (p. 53.) some En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to prove <hi>the Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi> of this <hi>Church</hi> to be not agreeable to the Word of God. First, Can. 36. <hi>Enjoyns Common Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49587:42"/>
and no other, which they had broke by Praying at St.</hi> Maryes, <hi>and is it self, a limitation of the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To the first, That the Church ever intended to <hi>bind men</hi> to say those <hi>Prayers</hi> in the Pulpit before Sermon, is not true; but contrary to her own <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>practice.</hi> Those <hi>universal words</hi> must ( as all others of that sort are to be) be referred <hi>ad subjectam materiam. The Liturgy</hi> was made for (what indeed it is, and hath approved it self to be, so far as <hi>skill</hi> and <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice</hi> never questioned, but <hi>carped</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at particular <hi>phrases,</hi>) it was made I say, only, for <hi>a Compleat Form of Publick Prayer,</hi> comprehensive of all our common needs imaginable; from whence, none could pretend upon that score, reason to vary. But it was never intended <hi>to banish occasional Prayers,</hi> (of which nature those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sermons are: for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which, a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Canon is provided, and that pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in words which admit of latitude,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49587:42"/>
I suppose, because they are looked upon as <hi>occasional,</hi> and so may better endure to be <hi>various.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Limitation of the Spirit,</hi> is a phrase equally admired by those who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand nothing, as laught at by those who do: It is vulgarly granted, but upon what reasons I could never yet learn; That [<hi>Praying by the Spirit</hi>] signifies in Scripture [<hi>To pray</hi> Ex tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore] Though to me it seems rather a sign of a <hi>voluble tongue</hi> then <hi>inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red heart</hi>; and <hi>to pray</hi> without <hi>consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> is rather, I should think, <hi>boldness</hi> then <hi>grace.</hi> But if that be the import of that phrase, as <hi>Women</hi> and <hi>Lecturers</hi> generally hold; <hi>the Prayer</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is least said by <hi>the Spirit</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>; and so the most <hi>unacceptable Prayer</hi> we can put up to him in all the world is <hi>his own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now I begin to think on that <hi>phrase,</hi> I profess my self unable to understand it; which makes me think, the reason many do not apprehend
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49587:43"/>
when the Argument drawn from thence is answered, is, Because they do not know what it means. It would be no inconsiderable damage to the <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Cause,</hi> if they would explain those terms, <hi>Limitation of the Spirit.</hi> I will pawn my Credit on it, the very admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Rowt shall laugh at it the very same moment they understand it; the whole force of it consisting like that of a <hi>charm,</hi> in being <hi>unintelligible.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I can guess it to be according to those principles and purposes it is used for, amounts clearly to this; He <hi>limits the Spirit</hi> in himself, who gives over while he hath <hi>one word</hi> left to say: and he <hi>limits</hi> it in another, when he <hi>suffers</hi> any body to <hi>hear</hi> him; because he <hi>confines</hi> him to his <hi>words,</hi> when <hi>the Spirit</hi> might possibly suggest to him <hi>different.</hi> And this is really so in every Auditory, unless we can suppose that every man there, (were he called to exercise) would use the same <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>words,</hi> which
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49587:43"/>
he who carryeth on <hi>the work</hi> of <hi>the day</hi> doth make use of.</p>
               <p>But some men have ventured to say and prove too, (which I wonder Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> took no notice of it, if he thought it possible to answer it) That <hi>the Directory</hi> it self was guilty of this <hi>evil,</hi> viz. <hi>Limiting the Spirit</hi> (if it be an <hi>evil</hi>) w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> it was intended to remove. That <hi>Directory prescribed matter,</hi> and in most cases the very <hi>order</hi> of <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Seeing it <hi>prescribes the matter</hi>; the only excellency whereby it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, is, it gives weak and careless that men (which are by much the <hi>major part</hi>) leave to choose <hi>words</hi> unapt to express that <hi>matter</hi> it self <hi>prescribes.</hi> It hath then all the real inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of <hi>unprescribed Prayers,</hi> and that one fancyed one of <hi>prescribed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second Exception of his (p. 54.) is very <hi>Tragical</hi> and <hi>vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In comes <hi>great zeal</hi> and <hi>little wit,</hi> and tells us of a <hi>fault</hi> so very gross, that the very plain <hi>Popish,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49587:44"/>
Scotch Service-Book,</hi> shall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for not being guilty: <hi>The very first sentence (so called) of Scripture is not there; At what time soever a sinner doth repent,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I perswade my self, Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> hath read in the <hi>New-Testament</hi> of proofs alleadged out of the <hi>Old,</hi> barely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>sense,</hi> the express words whereof are no where to be found; the instances are various, I mention but one, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.6. taken out of <hi>Micah</hi> 5.2. But what need I stand to prove, that some men can very be <hi>angry</hi> when there is little <hi>cause</hi> for it?</p>
               <p>Nor scape we so: and therefore Thirdly, In the last we did read that which is not Scripture; now we do not read what confessedly is. <hi>Much of the Canonical Scripture is omitted, Apocrypha read, some parts of the Scripture dignified above others, as the Gospel by standing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:49587:44"/>Many Chapters of the <hi>Canonical Scripture</hi> not being read in <hi>course,</hi> was one of the <hi>mighty faults</hi> the <hi>wise Assembly</hi> took upon them to <hi>mend,</hi> and it amounted to this. When the vulgar people came to Church to hear <hi>the Law</hi> of <hi>God</hi> according to which they must <hi>frame their lives</hi>; a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of the year they caused to be spent in <hi>Genealogies,</hi> or less <hi>Edifying History,</hi> which could not but have had the same effect upon the people read in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> as <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>; or else the <hi>Ceremonial Law,</hi> which at this day concerns no body, and never did concern them at all. This was so apparently absurd, that no imaginable account can be given of it, besides that (not very Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an) resolution of <hi>spite</hi> and <hi>singularity</hi>; or that politick <hi>Art</hi> of not receiving <hi>Pay, Preferment,</hi> and <hi>Applause,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out seeming to do something for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:49587:45"/>Our <hi>Dignifying</hi> (as they phrase it) <hi>some parts of Scripture above other, as the Gospel by standing,</hi> is a thing which provokes their anger; and Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> like an angry Disputant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes himself. Is that our fault, that we shew a <hi>peculiar respect</hi> to that part of it, which <hi>peculiarly</hi> concerns our <hi>Saviour,</hi> his <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Works?</hi> Our particular obligation assures us, it were ill if it were otherwise. <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Reverence</hi> (provided we do not let it serve in stead of, but use it to signifie and promote <hi>inward</hi>) cannot in that case be a crime. But if to <hi>dignifie some parts of Scripture above others</hi> be a crime, themselves are guilty: as doing so to the <hi>Psalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> (only they are not <hi>Davids,</hi> but <hi>Sternholds</hi>) by singing them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every Sermon, a thing in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture no where commanded. But so have I seen a distempered person in <hi>spite</hi> to another <hi>beat</hi> himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:49587:45"/>The next thing considerable, is, (p. 55, 56.) <hi>Christmas, Easter,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and the Holy-days, are superstitious, plainly repugnant to</hi> Gal. 4.10. Col. 2.16.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Feasts</hi> there mentioned, were evidently not <hi>Christian Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals:</hi> I suppose, I may safely conclude <hi>Christian Festivals</hi> not to be plainly forbid in that place, where they are not so much as spoke of. The Text in the <hi>Galatians</hi> mentions expresly <hi>Moneths</hi> and <hi>Years,</hi> proportions of <hi>Time</hi>; no way to be accommodated to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Festivals,</hi> or then, or now. That in the <hi>Colossians</hi> is so plain, that it must be a worse Principle than Inconsideration, which occasioned the mistake; not only, because it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses <hi>New Moons</hi>; (a thing not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished by <hi>Christian Authority:</hi>) but, in the words following the 17. verse, gives a clear account of the <hi>unlawfulness</hi> of those <hi>Feasts,</hi> of the Observance of which he there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, [<hi>which are a shadow of things
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49587:46"/>
to come, but the Body is Christ</hi>]. Those <hi>Feasts</hi> therefore were not reproved, as having been commanded by any <hi>Christian Church,</hi> (which, it is clear, they were not:) but, because they had in them not only a <hi>general malignity,</hi> as being kept in <hi>Obedience</hi> to the <hi>Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Law,</hi> and so must suppose that to be still in <hi>force</hi>; but had besides a <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar malignity</hi> in their <hi>nature</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (and for that very reason re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved) <hi>a shadow of Christ to come,</hi> and so consequently denyed <hi>His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Now then, all which can be gathered from this place, is, <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> must not keep <hi>Feasts</hi> which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured <hi>Christ to come; Ergo,</hi> they may not keep <hi>Feasts</hi> in remembrance that <hi>He is come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a pretty piece of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity (<hi>p.</hi> 56.) to enforce the former Conclusion, which no doubt would be admirable, if it were but sense. <hi>To observe the Nativity, Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Passion, Resurrection, Ascension,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49587:46"/>
severally; is irrational and irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: irrational, because they are not in themselves Mercies to the Church, but as they center in Mans Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; irreligious, because without Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine warrant.</hi> That none of all these signal condescensions of <hi>Divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> should be esteemed in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>Mercies,</hi> or worth giving <hi>thanks</hi> for, when <hi>Edge-Hill,</hi> and <hi>Nasby Battails,</hi> though but in order to the <hi>undoing</hi> of <hi>the King,</hi> were so accounted; argues a more passionate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem and concernment for <hi>the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> than that of <hi>Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That it is <hi>irreligious,</hi> because with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Divine warrant,</hi> is said, but not proved; For a thing becomes <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,</hi> only by being <hi>against some Law</hi>; that is, by being <hi>forbidden,</hi> not barely by being <hi>not commanded.</hi> Our Saviour Christ, we are sure, <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served Feasts,</hi> which had not such <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,</hi> notwithstanding that <hi>prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,</hi> which was as strict to the

               <p>That <hi>the Scripture</hi> is <hi>a compleat Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi> And what cannot be <hi>proved thereby,</hi> as it is interpreted by that <hi>Original</hi> and unquestionable <hi>Tradition,</hi> by which we receive <hi>the Scripture</hi> it self, is not to be believed as a revealed <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi> We not only assert, but in the defence of this Practice of ours, whereby we are
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49587:48"/>
said to <hi>over-throw the Scriptures</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>a compleat Rule,</hi> we contend for it as an advantagious <hi>Truth</hi> in <hi>this Cause:</hi> Because, this Doctrine, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be in <hi>Discipline,</hi> or <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> but what we find in <hi>Scripture,</hi> is a Doctrine in <hi>Scripture</hi> no where to be found. So, that the very Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation is the same Crime it would be thought to reprove. And, what is clear concerning this <hi>Principle,</hi> is as clear concerning their <hi>Practice</hi>; Till <hi>the Form</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> in <hi>the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory</hi> prescribed, be shewed to be so in <hi>the Bible</hi> too. <hi>The demand</hi> of <hi>the Written Word</hi> for every particular of <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi> is hugely plausible and senseless. I will not throw away <hi>Reason</hi> upon <hi>unreasonable men,</hi> to show the vanity of that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>tenent</hi>; That whatever (though but of <hi>Order, Decency, Discipline,</hi>) is not in <hi>the Written Word,</hi> which is <hi>a compleat Rule</hi> for all, is <hi>Will-Worship,</hi> &amp;c. I shall, for quiets sake, grant <hi>the Scripture</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:49587:49"/>
to be so; and, that <hi>the Directory,</hi> or any other <hi>beloved way,</hi> is plainly <hi>in terminis</hi> in the Bible. But then, I shall require this in return, that they would show me <hi>where-abouts,</hi> for I would willingly <hi>read it there</hi>; and truly, this is but reasonable. They, who when we obey <hi>the Church,</hi> though in matters of <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Decency,</hi> tell us, <hi>We hang our Faith upon the Churches sleeve,</hi> (though, by the way, the word [<hi>Faith</hi>] is not very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly applyed to such matters); They of all men should not require us to <hi>hang</hi> our <hi>eyes</hi> upon <hi>their sleeves</hi>; believe that <hi>Form</hi> to be plainly in <hi>Scripture,</hi> which we who know our selves able to <hi>read,</hi> know not to be <hi>there</hi>; let them but shew it us <hi>there,</hi> and we will <hi>believe.</hi> Themselves approve not, they tell us, <hi>Believing by an implicit Faith,</hi> and we as little like <hi>to see</hi> with <hi>implicit eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>things indifferent</hi> are not <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to be used,</hi> because <hi>command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:49587:49"/>
we need no other Principle but their own; That <hi>Humane Commands</hi> alter not <hi>the Nature of things, Ergo,</hi> They do not become <hi>unlawful</hi> by it; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they may even then be <hi>used without sin</hi>; and if so, Whether then it be not <hi>a duty,</hi> I leave to him to consider, who remembers <hi>Obedience</hi> to <hi>all Magistrates Civil</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> to be enjoyned in the terms of the greatest latitude? Those general Commands signifie some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: sure, the general Rule of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> were not intended for nothing. St. <hi>Paul</hi> reproved <hi>the irregularities</hi> at <hi>Corinth,</hi> upon other Principles then would admit the <hi>wild extravagancies</hi> of any thing that might be mistook for, or called, <hi>Tender Conscience. If any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the Churches of God.</hi> So then, to plead <hi>Christian Liberty</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Customs of the Church,</hi> is indeed <hi>spiritual Pride, Faction, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity,</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:49587:50"/>
though it may be called <hi>Conscience.</hi> There was a disorder in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> as we read, Chap. 14. v. 23. St. <hi>Paul</hi> rectified it by the Rules of <hi>Decorum,</hi> the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Reason, without any refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the revealed Will of God. [<hi>Will they not say, Ye are mad?</hi>] In the 26. of that Chapter, he tells them, One had <hi>a Psalm,</hi> another <hi>a Doctrine,</hi> a third <hi>a Revelation,</hi> &amp;c. Every one after his own way: as, if there be no <hi>common Authority</hi> which hath power to <hi>restrain,</hi> what can hinder? It is very probable, it was upon this very mistake of <hi>the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> given by <hi>Christ,</hi> as appears in the close of the Discourse, ver. 33. <hi>God is not the Author of Confusion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i.e.</hi> They mistake the matter quite, Christ indeed abolisht the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> but never told them he did those of <hi>Decency:</hi> He never institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Ordinances</hi> of <hi>disorder,</hi> or <hi>Sects</hi> of <hi>rudeness.</hi> And, if there must
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49587:50"/>
be <hi>Decency,</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> no <hi>confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> If <hi>Authority</hi> must not <hi>judge</hi> what is so, but every private man for himself; then I would fain know, how <hi>Order</hi> differs from <hi>Disorder.</hi> Though this is clear in the nature of the thing; yet I shall show out of Scripture it self, allowed Instances of the <hi>Churches Authority</hi> exercised over, and altering of, <hi>Institutions</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly immediate of <hi>divine Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> At the Institution of the Pass-over, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.11. it is commanded ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, they should eat it in that manner, <hi>with their loins girt, shooes on their feet, staves in their hands:</hi> yet our Saviour according to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and accustomed practise of that Church, eat it in <hi>a Table-posture,</hi> His <hi>loyns not girt,</hi> nor His <hi>staff in his hand.</hi> Now what account can be given of this matter by those who allow the Church in matters of this nature no <hi>Power,</hi> but declaratory what <hi>the written Word</hi> in this case
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49587:51"/>
(which every Cobler who can read, hath) let themselves tell us? The practice of the <hi>Kings</hi> in varying, as occasion served, in such cases from <hi>the Law</hi> is mentioned and commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Scripture,</hi> and hath been often urged in this case. The Truth, as well as the Practise, is clear; <hi>That the nature of Government can no more be devested of this Power, than it can of being what it pretends to be.</hi> This <hi>power</hi> of <hi>varying</hi> with occasions from the very express Letter of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>the Presbyterians</hi> as well as all the rest of the world <hi>allow</hi> and <hi>practise. The Eucharist</hi> was not instituted to be in <hi>the morning,</hi> nor at <hi>the Publike Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</hi> The Decree <hi>Act.</hi> 15. of <hi>things strangled,</hi> and <hi>bloud,</hi> though made by the authority and direction of <hi>God Himself,</hi> and in peremptory terms, is not observed; and he who says, <hi>The Reason</hi> of that <hi>Command ceases,</hi> doth not answer, but confirm my <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> That in <hi>change</hi> of <hi>Times</hi> we
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49587:51"/>
may <hi>alter</hi> what is <hi>established</hi> in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: much more Power, sure, we have over what is not at all mentioned there. <hi>The Order of Widows,</hi> treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of in the fifth Chap. of the 1. of <hi>Timothy,</hi> no where now. <hi>The famous Love-Feasts,</hi> every where ceased. Let them not delude the World with a shew of <hi>Scripture-Discipline,</hi> when of that little part which is come to our knowledge, themselves <hi>retain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> Though how according to their Principles who allow <hi>no Authority</hi> in <hi>the Church,</hi> but confine it to <hi>the Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word,</hi> be our <hi>Times</hi> never so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, they can omit or add any <hi>tittle</hi> without the most <hi>horrid Impiety,</hi> I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understand not.</p>
               <p>There is a Query, <hi>p.</hi> 59. which they are very happy in, having taken generally for granted. Sure I am, They cannnot say one word of sense to prove it. <hi>Whether the Instituting significant Ceremonies be not the very Formality of Superstition?</hi> I am
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49587:52"/>
very confident, were not our <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies significant,</hi> they would be styled <hi>silly</hi> and <hi>useless</hi>; and now they are <hi>significant,</hi> they are <hi>Impious.</hi> To the Query I say this; The word <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) is used seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times in Scripture: but in what place they can pretend it to have that <hi>meaning,</hi> I wish they would consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>first,</hi> and tell us <hi>afterward.</hi> The Criticks, I suppose, will not befriend them with such a notion of it in the learned Authors. I find St. <hi>Paul</hi> charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Athenians, Act.</hi> 17.22. down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right with this crime, <hi>Ye are too su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious.</hi> I suppose Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> will not prove the very <hi>formality</hi> of their <hi>fault,</hi> to be <hi>significant Ceremonies.</hi> I find in Scripture <hi>a significant Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> viz. <hi>The Holy kiss.</hi> If it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by the Apostles as they were <hi>Ordinary Governours of the Church,</hi> in that capacity they were to have <hi>Successors</hi> while there is <hi>a Church</hi> or <hi>World</hi>; and so it proves <hi>the Churches
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49587:52"/>
Power</hi> to institute <hi>significant Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</hi> If they did it as Apostles, it concerns us now.</p>
               <p>The most material Objection is, <hi>p.</hi> 60. <hi>How comes it to pass, that the work of the Ministery is divided in Ordination, Deacons Baptize but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister not the Lords Supper?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>the Church</hi> should give pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to <hi>Deacons to Baptize,</hi> though not to <hi>administer the Sacrament</hi> some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count may be given from the different natures of both <hi>Sacraments.</hi> Both of them, it is confessed, are <hi>equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Holy,</hi> yet were alwayes looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with some <hi>difference:</hi> that of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> as of greater <hi>necessity</hi>; that of <hi>the Lords Supper,</hi> as of greater <hi>solemnity,</hi> and consequently requiring greater <hi>preparation.</hi> Yet <hi>Baptism</hi> alwayes so esteemed, as not to be administred by <hi>a Deacon,</hi> but in the absence of <hi>a Priest.</hi> The great clamor amounts to this then, <hi>The Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi> because of the sudden occasions
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49587:53"/>
which may often require <hi>haste,</hi> hath therefore been thought fit by the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>the Church</hi> (rather than <hi>the administration</hi> thereof in case of <hi>danger</hi> should be <hi>omitted</hi>) to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be performed by a <hi>Deacon,</hi> in case <hi>a Priest</hi> be not at hand to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it. The case in <hi>the Lords Supper</hi> is clear otherwise; because, that is not usually administred without <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like notice</hi> given to the <hi>People</hi> some convenient time before, when it shall be done; at which time, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, <hi>the Priest</hi> who gave <hi>the notice,</hi> will be present to attend <hi>the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</hi> There is a clear disparity in <hi>the Natures</hi> of <hi>the two Sacraments</hi>; those Reasons which Apologize for <hi>Permission</hi> in case of <hi>the one,</hi> will by no means reach <hi>the other.</hi> Nor do we want evidence for <hi>the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, power</hi> to <hi>Baptize,</hi> out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture it self. In the 8. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> we read, that <hi>Philip the Deacon</hi> (ver. 12.) <hi>Baptized</hi>; that it was that <hi>Philip,</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:49587:53"/>
not <hi>the Apostle,</hi> appears, because we find <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> sent to <hi>lay hands on those</hi> he preached to, that they might <hi>receive the Holy Ghost,</hi> and accordingly we read, that they two did <hi>lay their hands</hi>; but no manner of intimation, that he did <hi>joyn with them:</hi> which he would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have done, had he been an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle.</hi> In the 21. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where his being <hi>one of the seven,</hi> i. e. <hi>a Deacon,</hi> is expresly mentioned, he is there owned an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> though but <hi>a Deacon.</hi> He who will say, he was <hi>a Presbyter,</hi> ought well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how to prove it.</p>
               <p>The next of the <hi>Oxf. Reasons,</hi> is; That in <hi>taking this Oath,</hi> they should <hi>break another.</hi> And, what security can they expect by an <hi>Oath,</hi> who themselves teach men to <hi>break them?</hi> By <hi>this Covenant</hi> they swear to <hi>alter</hi> what they had by <hi>the Parliaments Order</hi> sworn to <hi>maintain,</hi> in the Protestation 5. of <hi>May,</hi> 1641. Which
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49587:54"/>
Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> thus reconciles, <hi>p.</hi> 65. <hi>The House of Commons, the then known Legislators, explained the Protestation, to be meant only so far as is opposite to Popery.</hi> That is to say, <hi>The House of Commons</hi> are <hi>Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slators</hi> distinct from <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Peers:</hi> For in that capacity they made that <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation</hi> of an <hi>Oath,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>, sure, they were not <hi>solely to interpret,</hi> because they were not <hi>the sole Imposers,</hi> and they declared <hi>the Lords meaning</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their Lordships express <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test</hi> to the contrary, that that was not their <hi>meaning.</hi> Their being <hi>sole Legislators</hi> in <hi>defiance</hi> of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Peers,</hi> (for so it was in that case;) is very prety Doctrine, which I would have been glad to have seen <hi>one Law</hi> to have <hi>proved.</hi> I wonder Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> should think it would be taken for granted. But indeed, Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> hath one expression which could not have been well spared, <hi>The House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were then known to be,</hi> &amp;c. I must confess, there were many prety
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49587:54"/>
things <hi>then known to be,</hi> though no man knew why. The words of the Protestation, [<hi>The Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion expressed in the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] Now what is in <hi>the</hi> 39. <hi>Articles,</hi> is, I suppose, <hi>The Doctrine of the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: and then if <hi>the Covenant</hi> be contrary to any of those, these are <hi>contradictory Oaths.</hi> The 36. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,</hi> which declares, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, in <hi>the Book of Consecration, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious or ungodly,</hi> is hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable to <hi>the second Article of the Covenant.</hi> Sure, the meeting of <hi>the Assembly</hi> is irreconcileable with the 21. <hi>Article,</hi> if we suppose <hi>His Majesty</hi> was <hi>a King</hi> at that time. As to the explication of it, by <hi>the House of Commons,</hi> notwithstanding <hi>the Lords express dissent</hi>; it was an arrogating of <hi>the whole Parliamentary Power</hi> (and more) to themselves solely, and so a breach of <hi>the Fundamental Constitution</hi> of that <hi>Assembly.</hi> And then declaring
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49587:55"/>
none <hi>fit</hi> to bear <hi>Office</hi> but those who would except of that <hi>explication,</hi> and so concur with, and assist them in that <hi>violence</hi>; was against <hi>the Liberty of the Subject,</hi> as depriving Men of what they had no way legally forfeited. Where <hi>the Legislative Power</hi> resides, I do not here mean to decide: But certainly, according to the worst Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples then owned, <hi>The Commons</hi> were not <hi>the sole Legislators</hi>; and then, sure, not <hi>the sole Interpreters</hi>: and therefore the <hi>Oxf.</hi> Men had ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little cause to accept of their <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> for <hi>Authentick.</hi> That Man is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>obeyed,</hi> whose <hi>words</hi> must be taken in <hi>the sense</hi> that another (and he, as frequently in our case, his <hi>declared Enemy</hi>) shall put upon them.</p>
               <p>The next is, <hi>The consistency of the Covenant</hi> with <hi>the Oath of Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> which binds us to defend all <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdictions, Priviledges, Preheminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> granted, or belonging, united
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49587:55"/>
or annexed to the <hi>Imperial Crown</hi> of this <hi>Realm:</hi> of which in the 25 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 19. this is one; That <hi>the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy are not to Enact, Promulge,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>any new Canons, Constitutions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or by whatever Name they shall be called, unless the KINGS ROY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AL Assent first be had to make, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulge,</hi> &amp;c. Now the very <hi>meeting</hi> of <hi>the Assembly,</hi> and <hi>this Covenant</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was <hi>a defiance</hi> to this <hi>His Prerogative:</hi> unless the Votes of <hi>the two Houses</hi> be the <hi>KINGS ROYAL As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> answer to this, is, (<hi>p.</hi> 67.) in short, High Treason. <hi>That the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er given to the King, is such a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as Bishops, Cardinals, Popes had used, not such as Parliaments; who ever retained a Iurisdiction in themselves over Church and Crown.</hi> As I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand <hi>words, Your Majesties hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Loyal Subjects assembled in Parliament,</hi> signifies not <hi>your Lords and Masters.</hi> How comes <hi>Treason</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:49587:56"/>

This is a strange concealed <hi>Iurisdiction of the two Houses,</hi> which never any <hi>King owned,</hi> or <hi>Parliament claimed.</hi> When King <hi>Iames</hi> came in, he should have recognized <hi>them,</hi> not they <hi>him:</hi> Nor was that <hi>Parliament faithful</hi> either to <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Countrey,</hi> in concealing so <hi>important a concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> I will cite but <hi>one Law,</hi> and that not <hi>Ancient</hi>; for none, I think, can doubt its Opinion in this point, but one.

<q>Whereas by sundry old Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Histories, it is manifestly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, That this <hi>Realm</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> is an Empire governed by <hi>One Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Head</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> having the Dignity and Royal Estate of the <hi>IM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PERIAL Crown</hi> of this <hi>Realm</hi>; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

whom <hi>a Body Politick</hi> compact of all sorts and degrees of People, and divided in terms, and by names, of <hi>Spiritualty</hi> &amp; <hi>Temporalty</hi> bin bound, and ought to bear, next to God, <hi>a natural</hi> and <hi>humble Obedience.</hi>
                  </q>
If <hi>the King</hi> is next to <hi>God</hi>; what <hi>Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction the two Houses have over Him,</hi> I profess my self unable to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend: or how, owning <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>humble Obedience</hi> signifies <hi>retaining Iurisdiction over Him.</hi> But those who are not of this wild Opinion, do yet embrace the ground of it, and stand stiff for <hi>a share</hi> in <hi>the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> These two grounds Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten insists upon, <hi>That their Assent is necessary to the making and repealing Laws: and that the King receiving his Power from them, they reserved a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of it to themselves.</hi> The for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer I have spoken to in [<hi>The Rebels Plea</hi>] That that doth not at all evince any such thing: and it is also false in Experience; for <hi>the Monarchs</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:49587:58"/>
of <hi>the East,</hi> whom none ever supposed to have <hi>sharers in the Government,</hi> could not <hi>alter all their Laws at pleasure,</hi> &amp;c. And I there referred to an Author who had so admirably stated that Point in <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> in that Incomparable Treatise [<hi>The Case of our Affairs</hi>], that nothing can be added on that <hi>Head,</hi> it is there done so fully and clearly. I think, it is not easie to shew such <hi>a King,</hi> whose <hi>Laws</hi> are as <hi>ambulatory</hi> as his <hi>pleasure</hi>; and yet, sure, there are some whose Subjects are not <hi>Partners</hi> in <hi>the Soveraignty.</hi> And certainly, so long as <hi>Kings</hi> are but single men, and not naturally strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then all their <hi>Subjects</hi>; they must rule by the help and advice either of <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> or <hi>Ianizaries.</hi> The former way is (I think) more honourable for <hi>the King,</hi> and better for <hi>his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> There can be no way of proving this Proposition; unless it carries its own Evidence: which though gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49587:59"/>
granted, I do not apprehend why. <hi>The Prince promises not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise such a part of his Power, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the consent of his People,</hi> Ergo, <hi>They share with him in it,</hi> is a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence far from Necessary. When <hi>Tenants</hi> get <hi>Rights</hi> by <hi>Promise, Grant,</hi> or <hi>Custom</hi>; do they presently <hi>share</hi> in <hi>the Dominion?</hi> Is none a perfect <hi>Landlord</hi> that cannot <hi>turn out all his Tenants,</hi> as easily as <hi>say so?</hi> Can no man make another a firm Estate in <hi>the Tenancy,</hi> but <hi>eo ipso</hi> he makes him <hi>his Co-Landlord?</hi> Is it the same to have <hi>sharers</hi> in <hi>the Authority,</hi> and to be <hi>limited</hi> in <hi>the exercise</hi> of it? This is perfectly the case: <hi>The King</hi> hath granted to us, that he will not <hi>alter our old Laws,</hi> or <hi>make new,</hi> till by common consent it is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to him expedient for <hi>the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique good</hi>: from hence alone we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that we <hi>share</hi> with him in <hi>the making</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:49587:59"/>As to the other Point, <hi>That Princes received their Power by Election,</hi> is a very <hi>plausible Impossibility.</hi> Let us consider a <hi>rude scattered multitude,</hi> (as Men are supposed to have been, when they chose <hi>their first Governours,</hi>) li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>sine Lege, sine Lare</hi>; to meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about a business of <hi>that nature,</hi> where could not but be many, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended it their Interest <hi>to use Violence.</hi> Can we suppose them all to carry it <hi>fairly,</hi> and <hi>prudently,</hi> and <hi>equally</hi>? A thing, which certainly we could not expect from the most <hi>civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized Common-wealth</hi> this day in the World. There could not want <hi>bold Villains,</hi> who would make it their <hi>business,</hi> to <hi>usurp Dominion</hi> over their <hi>well-meaning neighbours.</hi> There could not but be many, who would think themselves <hi>wise enough to Rule.</hi> Nor could there want enow, to make their <hi>title</hi> good by <hi>strong hand,</hi> by the Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bination though of <hi>a very few</hi>; and the Combination of <hi>a very few,</hi> could

their whole <hi>Being,</hi> or <hi>Authority,</hi> is purely derivative: and if they will say <hi>by grant</hi>; let them produce it.</p>
               <p>But after all this, <hi>the Covenant</hi> is not <hi>justifiable,</hi> though the Parliament had such a transcendent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of Authority.

Promoters</hi> of <hi>this Covenant</hi> were, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, very great <hi>encroachers</hi> upon <hi>the Royal Authority</hi>; if <hi>ROYAL</hi> relates to <hi>the KING.</hi> Their Brethren in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whom they <hi>Covenant</hi> to be the same with; have stood in (and owned <hi>the</hi>) <hi>Defiance</hi> of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> &amp; claim <hi>a coactive Power Independent</hi> on either. <hi>The Convocations</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> acknowledge themselves to have <hi>no power to Enact or Promulge any new Canons, without the Kings leave.</hi> Which of the two are the <hi>Encroachers</hi> then, it is not hard to determine. <hi>Si fur displice at Verri, &amp;c. The Disciplina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Calvinists,</hi> objecting <hi>disloyalty</hi> to <hi>Bishops,</hi> is like as <hi>the Doctrinal</hi> ones accused <hi>the Arminians</hi> of making God <hi>the Author of sin,</hi> and <hi>damning men</hi> for what Himself had <hi>necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> them to do.

                  <hi>the things</hi> were <hi>indifferent,</hi> i. e. such as were not <hi>unlawful.</hi> If they were, as Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> sayes, <hi>meer trifles:</hi> it is no sign of <hi>the best men</hi> to be <hi>contentious</hi> about <hi>such things,</hi> about <hi>trifles.</hi> Some little prejudices against, or rather mistakes about, <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopacy,</hi> of no moment, I pass o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and come to the Capital Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>p.</hi> 75. <hi>Episcopacy is a plain and clear Popery,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So say</hi> Salmasius <hi>and</hi> Beza, <hi>Episcopi Papam pepererunt.</hi> I do here very much question, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Gentleman <hi>believes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:</hi> and that not only, because of the notoriousness of the contrary evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing those <hi>two Governments,</hi> to all who understand the Constitution of them, to be not only <hi>different,</hi> but <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent.</hi> But also because the grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Ius Divinum</hi> of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> would over-throw unavoidably that of <hi>the Papacy.</hi> And this is even by Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> himself, before he thought on it, acknowledged, when (<hi>p.</hi> 82.) in sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

up his Authors, he brings none who speak so clearly for him as a Pope.

               </p>
               <p>It seems, Sir, <hi>Popery</hi> is no friend to the <hi>Ius Divinum</hi> of <hi>Episcopacy.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 78, Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> tells us, <hi>That the Pope's Legate interdicted the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute in the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Divine Right of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy; or directed it in such general and uncertain debates, that there might be no determination of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is <hi>the Pope</hi> so much his own <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>; as not to endure <hi>the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of that which is his <hi>best sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port?</hi> Doth <hi>the Pope</hi> so much dread his <hi>best plea,</hi> as not to endure to <hi>hear,</hi> it, or let any <hi>own it?</hi> Sure, they had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoughts of the <hi>Ius Divinum</hi> of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi>: which, sure I am, is as much abhorred there as at <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va.</hi>

               <p>It is said by the <hi>Oxf.</hi> men in their <hi>third ground</hi> of their <hi>first exception,</hi> That they are not satisfyed of that Phrase in the Covenant [<hi>Lest we be partakers of other mens sins</hi>].

Replyes, <hi>p.</hi> 76. <hi>That they are so guilty,</hi> but hath not one word to prove it. <hi>That Saints in Scripture did weep for other mens sins, I read:</hi> But that they esteemed them to be made <hi>their own,</hi> if they did not <hi>fight them down,</hi> I do <hi>not read.</hi> There were Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> who were <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,</hi> and the Law was general, that they who were such should be <hi>put to death</hi>: yet, I do not find the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets telling the People, that it was the same thing for them not to <hi>stone the King,</hi> as it was for him to <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship stones.</hi> And yet this is the Import of that expression; <hi>Those are our sins, we are partakers of them, if we do not pull them down:</hi> The Foundation of the second Article of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, is harder then all the Laws of God besides, (if it self be one).

this they make to be every mans <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and <hi>swear</hi> him to it, under no milder expressions then these; [<hi>Lest we be partakers of other mens sins, and so in danger to receive their plagues</hi>].

               </p>
               <p>The first thing of moment against this Article, is <hi>p.</hi> 78. That <hi>the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49587:69"/>
alleadged Practise of</hi> 1500 <hi>years will more weaken then strengthen the Divine Right; for, the most pure estate was before that in the first</hi> 140. <hi>years.</hi> I shall not at all insist upon the <hi>Catalogues</hi> of <hi>Bishops,</hi> in unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable Histories to be had even from the beginning. But only say this, That <hi>all Christian Churches</hi> in those dayes should deviate from <hi>the Primitive pattern,</hi> and all <hi>the same way,</hi> no <hi>common cause</hi> imaginable inducing them to <hi>err the same way,</hi> is a thing highly incredible. As to that which is ordinarily urged, <hi>viz. Ambition,</hi> it could not, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider <hi>the Persons,</hi> or <hi>Times,</hi> have been <hi>universal</hi>; nor, if we consider <hi>the thing,</hi> have been <hi>at all.</hi> Being <hi>a Bishop,</hi> having only the priviledge of being <hi>burnt</hi> next.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> in the following Pages makes demands for <hi>Texts.</hi> Though the Article insists only on <hi>Practise,</hi> and so is not concerned. Which if
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49587:70"/>
not granted good, <hi>National, Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Churches, The Canon of the Scripture,</hi> and <hi>the Lords-Day,</hi> are lost. Nor is this Truth utterly past by in Scripture: though if it had, considering that the intent was to deliver to us <hi>Doctrine,</hi> not <hi>the precise Form</hi> of <hi>Discipline,</hi> we might rationally have appealed to <hi>Antiquity</hi> in that Point, <hi>i. e.</hi> to <hi>the Practise</hi> of those from whom we receive <hi>the Canon</hi> of <hi>the Scripture,</hi> and without whose Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage, were it once questioned, it were not possible without <hi>immediate Revelation</hi> to have it sufficiently <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested</hi> to be what it pretends to be.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> tells us, that <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> are <hi>intrusted</hi> with the same <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Governing.</hi> But I cannot be satisfied in this particular: since I find <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> being sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle men, are without any intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of others being <hi>equal with them,</hi> directed how to <hi>receive accusations,</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:49587:70"/>
and to <hi>rebuke</hi> and <hi>censure.</hi> Evidences, in my apprehension, pregnant enough of <hi>sole Iurisdiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To disprove the Universal alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Practise, he tells us, <hi>That the King of</hi> Denmark <hi>in the year</hi> 1537. <hi>exstirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, and so did the</hi> Scots <hi>since.</hi> Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, goodly! And so did those he pleads for, <hi>the long Parliament.</hi> I cannot apprehend but that either he <hi>droles,</hi> or is utterly ignorant of <hi>the nature</hi> of <hi>Tradition,</hi> as taking it to be, what none ever contradicted; a notion of it, which they that understand what it means, have not. Sure I am, at that rate, <hi>the Deity</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not approve it self to be <hi>Catholick Doctrine,</hi> because there were <hi>Arians</hi> of old, and are <hi>Socinians</hi> now.</p>
               <p>The <hi>mutual correspondence</hi> by <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> which was at that time used in <hi>the Church</hi> forbad any <hi>Church</hi> to be <hi>ignorant</hi> of what <hi>all the Churches do hold</hi>; so that <hi>Innovations</hi> could not but be discovered: And to suppose,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49587:71"/>
that the same <hi>Imposture</hi> should be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed upon <hi>all the Churches</hi> together in those early dayes, as an <hi>Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Tradition,</hi> upon so many various Countries, and Inclinations upon men, whose choisest care was in <hi>deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>dying</hi> for that <hi>Faith</hi> they had <hi>once received</hi> from <hi>the Apostles</hi>; is to suppose all the World to be out of their wits together. If they tell us, It was <hi>the ambition</hi> of Pastors, that introduced that <hi>Order</hi>; no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count can be given how this should be <hi>universal,</hi> and yet not <hi>perceived,</hi> or <hi>resisted:</hi> and this is as strange as to the Exemplar <hi>Piety</hi> of those <hi>Times.</hi> And yet more, in the nature of the thing it is absurd: For <hi>their ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in that case, could tend to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a more quick and severe <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> to be sooner <hi>burnt</hi> then their fellows.

the Church, when that Statute was made, was <hi>Popish,</hi> he insinuates that it was so when it was <hi>first founded</hi> in <hi>Prelacy.</hi> A thing which the <hi>Romanists</hi> have long in vain la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to prove; and if Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> will at last do it effectually, the <hi>Pope</hi> will (no doubt) acknowledge his <hi>good sevice</hi> with <hi>many thanks.</hi>

               <p>The third of the <hi>Oxf. Reasons</hi> is now considered, Why it was not in its own <hi>turn</hi> considered, I know not, unless this <hi>Book</hi> was wrote by <hi>a Club,</hi> and he to whose <hi>lot</hi> this fell, was not <hi>timely provided.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first was this, The <hi>Oxf. men</hi> alleadge, <hi>That they had, as they were by Law required, testified their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation to that Government as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Word of God, which they are now required to swear down as contrary to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> (if not, for the above mentioned Reason, his fellow-helper) tells us, <hi>The Article might
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49587:72"/>
only intend it to be a Political Civil Constitution, as indeed all our Statutes do suggest, and so an adiaphoron,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 94.</p>
               <p>This is the best <hi>Salvo</hi> to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile this <hi>Oath</hi> with <hi>the Subscription,</hi> and this Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> himself refutes, <hi>p.</hi> 95. By telling us, That in the Book <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Priests,</hi> &amp;c.

Which words declare their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to found that <hi>Government</hi> upon <hi>the Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> not <hi>the Law</hi> of <hi>the Land</hi>; and so that <hi>Interpretation</hi> of his is false: and the <hi>Oxf. mens Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> good, and <hi>the Covenant</hi> irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable with <hi>the Subscription.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Oxf. mens</hi> second Reason is, <hi>They had received Orders from Bishops Hands, and theref<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>re could not so ill requite them, as to lay to their hands to pull them down.</hi> To which Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> Replyes, <hi>p.</hi> 96. <hi>In so doing, they would do the Bishops a real kindness,</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:49587:73"/>
of which he gives us this satisfactory account. Richard Havering <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of</hi> Dublin, <hi>dreamt that a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster heavier then the whole world stood upon him, and when he waked, thought it to be his Bishoprick, and renounced it.</hi> Sure Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> was <hi>scarse awake,</hi> when he thought to <hi>answer</hi> the University with <hi>a dream.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth Reason is this, <hi>They held their livelyhoods by such Titles,</hi> &amp;c.

The Power</hi> of <hi>Parliaments</hi> over our <hi>Estates,</hi> so as to dispose of some part in <hi>Taxes</hi> according to our several Proportions, is indeed clear and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal.

But this <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> which Mr. <hi>Cr,</hi> pleads for, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually groundless and unreasonable: <hi>a power</hi> so unlimited both in regard to their <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Countrey</hi>; as it is not fit in regard of either they should have, nor doth it at all appear how, or when, they came to have it.

               </p>
               <p>As to <hi>Lands</hi> that the <hi>two Houses</hi> have any thing to do, further then by <hi>Established Laws</hi> they are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, which receive <hi>all force</hi> from <hi>the Kings assent</hi>; I cannot imagine ground for.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Lands</hi> we all <hi>receive</hi> from, and <hi>hold</hi> of, <hi>the KING</hi>; as Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Cook</hi> in the first part of his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stit.</hi> and, as I remember, in the very beginning: but that we at all <hi>depend</hi> upon <hi>the two Houses</hi> for them, He (though a great <hi>adorer</hi> of that <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly</hi>) affirmeth not. But if we had <hi>received them</hi> partly from <hi>the two Houses,</hi> (of which there is not

the least <hi>shadow</hi> or <hi>colour,</hi>) yet that would not <hi>justifie</hi> this Doctrine, <hi>They may dispose of them at pleasure</hi>; as Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> prodigiously affirms to the <hi>Oxf.</hi> men, who alleadge, That they were not <hi>convict</hi> of <hi>any crime,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had not <hi>broke</hi> the <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> upon which they <hi>received them.</hi> Did <hi>they,</hi> at the same time, <hi>give them,</hi> and <hi>keep them,</hi> at their <hi>own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose?</hi> And upon this ground it is, that <hi>His Majesty</hi> could not, without <hi>injustice,</hi> and consequently without <hi>sin,</hi> should He have agreed to <hi>the Houses</hi> in that particular; (though in <hi>the Courts</hi> of <hi>Earth,</hi> it might have had <hi>the effect</hi> of <hi>a Law</hi>; yet in that of <hi>Heaven,</hi> it would have <hi>passed</hi> for <hi>Iniquity</hi> established by <hi>a Law</hi>:) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by giving it to another, he passed away that <hi>interest</hi> from himseif, when he gave it away.

Power</hi> in <hi>the two Houses,</hi> when they were <hi>in hostile opposition</hi> to <hi>the King</hi>: and so makes us as <hi>great Slaves,</hi> as Earth hath any; to our <hi>fellow-Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</hi> And much greater <hi>slaves</hi> are all we <hi>free-born People</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> made by <hi>the assertors</hi> of our <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>; then <hi>Villains</hi> were among our selves. For I remember, though not <hi>the page,</hi> and have not <hi>the book</hi> by me, that Sir <hi>Edw.

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49587:76"/>
Power</hi> remains as good as ever: which <hi>the Lords</hi> of <hi>the Villains</hi> did not. And in <hi>the second,</hi> let our <hi>Estate</hi> be never so <hi>fixed,</hi> it is, as Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> assures us, <hi>p.</hi> 97. but <hi>at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Parliament</hi>; and by that too, he means, <hi>the two Houses.</hi> And this is <hi>securing Propriety:</hi> but so they <hi>secured the King</hi> at <hi>Holmby,</hi> and the <hi>Isle of Wight.</hi> Certainly, this <hi>Scottish Doctrine</hi> would never have been <hi>pleaded for</hi> by any, but those whom <hi>the two Houses</hi> had assured, they should have <hi>a considerable share</hi> in the <hi>next scamble.</hi> But I marvel the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should like <hi>this Doctrine</hi>; they have (sure I am) no Reason, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is called <hi>Securing Propriety.</hi> And thus it is true of us, what <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth, is said, by <hi>Strada,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the <hi>Dutchmen, Nullos esse populos qui servitutis nomen magis execrentur magis, patiantur.</hi> We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure to be called, <hi>Slaves, slaves</hi>; but will earnestly <hi>contend</hi> to

be so. And truly, the <hi>effect</hi> would have been <hi>the same</hi> in <hi>both,</hi> had our <hi>Noble Patriots</hi> been uninterrupted <hi>Victors</hi>; who fought against <hi>Taxes,</hi> till we came to <hi>pay</hi> the greatest in all the World.</p>
               <p>All this which hath been hitherto urged in this Point, hath been in their <hi>behalf</hi> only as men which equally concerns <hi>all the Nation.</hi> There is something yet for them, in that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, to be urged, which is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to it. How? If besides <hi>the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest</hi> the <hi>Oxf.</hi> men had in them as theirs; <hi>God</hi> had <hi>an interest</hi> in them as His. Sure I am, if God doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of <hi>any thing</hi> from men under <hi>the Gospel</hi>: He hath such <hi>an interest</hi> in those <hi>Lands</hi>; because they were <hi>granted</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> by <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; and when they were in <hi>a National capacity,</hi> and so according to Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> Divinity, <hi>p.</hi> 145. <hi>That obligation not to divert them to other uses, lies upon us while we are a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

By that National Act, each man is barred, even those who are not by a Personal.</hi> This is Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> own <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity</hi> throughout his whole <hi>Sixth Section</hi>; particularly in <hi>p.</hi> 145, 146, &amp;c. The <hi>Covenant</hi> swears <hi>us</hi> to <hi>that</hi> we were before <hi>obliged</hi> not to do. That that was one <hi>alteration</hi> Christ brought into the World; That God would henceforth <hi>accept</hi> of <hi>no fixed Estate</hi> in any thing from men, to the <hi>use</hi> of those who were <hi>employed</hi> in <hi>the Sacred Function</hi>: is a part of the <hi>Gospel</hi> not at all <hi>revealed</hi> in <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</hi> That whatever is <hi>given</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> is <hi>forfeited</hi> to <hi>the State,</hi> (though given before <hi>the Civil Law</hi> had <hi>prohibited</hi> it;) is a strange <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi> of <hi>Mortmain.</hi> The Money <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> his <hi>Lands</hi> were sold for, God is said (<hi>Acts</hi> 5.) <hi>to have an Interest in</hi>: Would He not have had <hi>an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest</hi> in <hi>the Land too,</hi> had it not been <hi>sold?</hi> This is a very <hi>strange Evasion</hi>; but only men must say <hi>something.</hi>

When the only reason why God had <hi>an Interest</hi> in the <hi>mony,</hi> was, because it was <hi>the price of his own Land.</hi> Whence can <hi>my title</hi> come to <hi>the mony,</hi> for which <hi>such Land</hi> was <hi>sold, co nomine,</hi> as <hi>the Price of it,</hi> if I have <hi>no interest</hi> in that <hi>Land</hi>?

those who <hi>believe</hi> him to be <hi>a God.</hi> This were a most admirable <hi>plea</hi> for a Rebel; who <hi>owned him</hi> whom he <hi>fought against,</hi> to be his <hi>lawful Prince.</hi> If I should urge examples out of the <hi>Old Testament</hi>; the answer is ready: Whatever is there to be found, if men have not <hi>a mind</hi> to it, <hi>is part of the Ceremonial Law abolisht at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ.</hi> Though why any thing should be counted <hi>part</hi> of that <hi>Law,</hi> which <hi>Moses</hi> doth not set down <hi>as such</hi>; nor I, nor they, can give any <hi>tolerable account.</hi> They must, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, say, <hi>Moses his description is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect.</hi> But that this is one of the differences of <hi>the Priesthood</hi> of <hi>the Law,</hi> and <hi>the Ministery</hi> of <hi>the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel</hi>; that in the <hi>Lands</hi> of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer God had <hi>an Interest,</hi> and not in those of the latter: is, I think, not from Scripture to be <hi>found.</hi> What I cite out of the <hi>Iewish</hi> story in this matter, is answered; They were <hi>Iews:</hi> what out of other sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;

They were <hi>Heathens.</hi> If I should cite the example of the <hi>Patriarch</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>the Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and shew them to have alwayes esteemed God <hi>interested</hi> in <hi>such Lands:</hi> Then their answer is, themselves know not well what; but at last, all the <hi>Patriarchs actions,</hi> were <hi>Figures of things to come,</hi> the <hi>body is Christ.</hi> And that, as the rest, was <hi>Typical.</hi> If I aske, <hi>Typical of what?</hi> I must be fain to tell them my self; <hi>Priests</hi> all along being capable of <hi>Land</hi> in <hi>Gods Right</hi> before <hi>the Gospel,</hi> was <hi>Typical</hi> of this, That those under <hi>the Gospel</hi> should not be so <hi>capable.</hi> Believe it, a most special and proper <hi>Type</hi> it is.

to be <hi>committed</hi> in the times of <hi>the Gospel,</hi> though there be no <hi>command</hi> in <hi>the Gospel</hi> for them.</p>
               <p>But after all this, there is a <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial thing</hi> in this <hi>Exception,</hi> not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of by Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> which is, <hi>The Iniquity</hi> of <hi>this Article,</hi> in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging the <hi>Oxf.</hi> men to <hi>pull down</hi> those, by whose <hi>titles</hi> many of them hold their <hi>lively-hoods, i. e.</hi> to <hi>bind</hi> them, (even before they are <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed</hi> of any <hi>crime</hi>) to <hi>undo</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. The wildly large <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Parliaments</hi> alledged, is not large enough to reach this. For, though they have <hi>power</hi> to dispose of <hi>my Estate</hi> at <hi>pleasure</hi>; yet, to <hi>bind</hi> me sincerely, to the utmost of <hi>my power,</hi> to endevour to <hi>assist them</hi> in <hi>ruining my self,</hi> is a thing far different.

               <p>In the 101 <hi>page,</hi> He considers that <hi>Argument</hi> used in behalf of <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Government,</hi> viz. <hi>The agreeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of it to the <hi>civil constitution</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> which he proves to be <hi>no Argument</hi> by <hi>two Mediums.</hi> The first is, <hi>Christs Kingdom is not of this world,</hi> Ergo.

               </p>
               <p>As to the later <hi>Argument,</hi> I shall not answer it at all; but desire the Reader to consult the place, that he may see that <hi>the Argument</hi> is his <hi>own</hi>: and then ask him, Whether <hi>in the beginning God created the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and the earth</hi>; ergo, <hi>The agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness

of,</hi> &amp;c. were not altogether as conclusive.</p>
               <p>As to the former, though a slighted <hi>Argument,</hi> I say it is a <hi>material one:</hi> and it is none of the least commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> that it provides even for the <hi>temporal secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of <hi>men</hi> and <hi>states</hi>; and, were they obeyed universally, we should have a kind of <hi>heaven</hi> before we came thither.

               <p>That <hi>Clergy-men</hi> may not <hi>meddle</hi> with <hi>Temporal Affairs,</hi> (if a truth) is such a one, which, <hi>the Presbyterian Ministers</hi> are the most <hi>unfit people</hi> in the world to <hi>plead for:</hi> of whose <hi>guilt</hi> in this particular, <hi>these Nations,</hi> and almost <hi>all Europe,</hi> are <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>bloudy Testimonies.</hi> Nor did they procure <hi>the least share</hi> they have had by <hi>the pretence</hi> of <hi>having none,</hi> and disclaiming to <hi>have any.</hi> Here I might be copious, but to omit others, I shall peculiarly stick to the business
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49587:82"/>
in hand, and only intimate <hi>the self-condemnation</hi> they brought upon <hi>themselves,</hi> in relation to this <hi>Tenent,</hi> and the <hi>Oxf. men.</hi> To be <hi>Head</hi> of <hi>a Colledge,</hi> is certainly <hi>a Civil Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:</hi> and this, sure, they did not <hi>refuse</hi>; but <hi>contend for</hi> with <hi>War, fraud,</hi> and <hi>violence.</hi> Did they not very <hi>godlily Visit themselves</hi> into what <hi>a godly Minister</hi> dares not be, as being uncapable? To be <hi>a Vice-Chancellour</hi> as so, and in that <hi>right</hi> to be <hi>a Iustice of Peace,</hi> are <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities,</hi> (I think) not <hi>purely spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</hi> And to be <hi>a School-Master</hi> is so too. And to take the other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment used in this case; <hi>The Ministery requires the whole man:</hi> this takes up more time from <hi>his Function Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial</hi> than to be <hi>a Peer of the Realm.</hi> And this last instance brings in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, <hi>To be Master of a Family</hi> is <hi>a Civil Authority; Correction,</hi> there not <hi>purely spiritual.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:49587:82"/>But the truth, though urged in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of both these <hi>Presbyterian Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents,</hi> signifies <hi>nor of, nor on,</hi> to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. They are an <hi>Answer</hi> to a <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi>; they are the deciding (or rather taking away the Foundation of) <hi>a Controversie.</hi> We shall therefore endeavour to attain their true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by that sure and easie and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected Method; considering the <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> upon which those words were delivered. For it is not <hi>citing,</hi> but <hi>profaning</hi> Scripture, to urge it as <hi>a proof</hi> of what it was never intended to <hi>concern:</hi> But such shifts those men are unavoidably brought to, who first <hi>resolve</hi> upon <hi>Conclusions</hi> and <hi>Practices,</hi> and then are necessitated to <hi>seek Principles</hi> to make <hi>them good</hi>; those men must make <hi>the best</hi> of such as they <hi>can get.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Occasion</hi> of those words must needs be the same with <hi>the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel</hi> he thereby <hi>appeased:</hi> unless we will suppose our <hi>Saviour</hi> to have
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49587:83"/>
spoke <hi>besides the business</hi> He spoke to; and <hi>the Disciples</hi> satisfied with <hi>nothing</hi> to the <hi>purpose:</hi> which <hi>Disputes</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout being <hi>made great,</hi> seldom are. Which was this; The <hi>Iews</hi> had an Opinion of <hi>the Messias</hi> as of <hi>a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Prince</hi>; and <hi>the Disciples</hi> were not free from that <hi>Error:</hi> and in this sense it was, they thought he should <hi>restore the Kingdom to Israel.</hi> Upon this account, they thought their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> entituled them to <hi>Secular Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,</hi> &amp; were <hi>sharing the great Offices.</hi> And that this was it <hi>Christ reproved,</hi> and that this was the very mistake; is as often evident, as there are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses of theirs about <hi>Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:</hi> The not thorough purging out of which Tenent, was the cause, that <hi>one branch</hi> of it occasioned the <hi>Mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narian Error</hi> in <hi>the first Ages.</hi> Christ had indeed promised them <hi>they should raign with Him in his Kingdom:</hi> But let them not nourish <hi>carnal pride,</hi> for <hi>His Kingdom</hi> was not to be <hi>here.</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:49587:83"/>
All which can be gathered from hence, is, That <hi>Christians, as such, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not claim Secular Honors: or, if they have them, they are not by reason of them to be supercilious toward, but more useful to, those who want them; not to scorn, but to help their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> This doth not all prove, That if <hi>the Civil Magistrate,</hi> at whose disposal <hi>Honours</hi> are, will <hi>dignifie Clergy-men,</hi> they may not <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it</hi>; when it may be <hi>the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>the welfare</hi> of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State:</hi> which are no such <hi>Enemies</hi> as that they cannot be administred to by the same Persons. I wonder, how so much is so securely built on this Text, when it cannot be made out, that <hi>Christ</hi> spake these words to <hi>the Apostles</hi> as in the capacity of <hi>Clergy-men.</hi> That <hi>Clergy-men,</hi> either as so, or as <hi>Christians,</hi> have not an <hi>eternal Right</hi> to <hi>Secular Honours,</hi> I grant. Christ <hi>bequeathed</hi> no such <hi>thing:</hi> but that He any where made <hi>them uncapable,</hi>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:49587:84"/>
if <hi>the Civil Magistrate</hi> (who is <hi>the Fountain of Honour,</hi>) bestows any up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, I no where read. He left those things as he found them: to be <hi>bestowed</hi> as he whose <hi>right</hi> it was to <hi>dispose</hi> of them should <hi>see cause.</hi> Christ would, certainly, have sharply and plainly <hi>reprehended</hi> such an <hi>Universal Custom,</hi> had he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to remove it. But seeing He and his Apostles said nothing <hi>against it,</hi> they certainly intended it to <hi>remain</hi> as before.</p>
               <p>The Exception to the third Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, is, That there is <hi>a limitation</hi> put upon an <hi>absolute duty. [To defend the Kings Person and Authority, in the preservation of the true Religion, and Liberties of the Kingdom].</hi> Though <hi>the King</hi> is really <hi>bound</hi> to those things: yet <hi>his neglect</hi> of <hi>his duty,</hi> doth not <hi>discharge us of ours.</hi> To this Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> replyes, <hi>Those words are not a limitation of duty; but a predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the capacity the Parliament
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49587:84"/>
and People were in, and so the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is; We being in the preservation of the true Religion and Liberties of the Kingdom, shall endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the King,</hi> &amp;c. An <hi>Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> not to be made good by <hi>Grammar</hi>: To which (I must needs confess this though) it may as easily be reconciled, as to their Actions. All <hi>Declarations</hi> and <hi>Sermons</hi> were but <hi>Satyrs</hi> against <hi>the King</hi>; they represented Him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually an <hi>Enemy</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man, Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi>; upon which score, they justified <hi>Violences,</hi> as great as they would have his <hi>Crimes</hi> thought. In short, they had this pretence, to deprive him of <hi>all power,</hi> and that he was not fit to be <hi>trusted with any.</hi> Let any man but ask himself, what <hi>case</hi> the King was in, what <hi>usage</hi> he had, or might <hi>expect</hi> in those <hi>dayes</hi>; he would readily grant this Interpretation of Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> (which is indeed as far from <hi>the sense</hi> of <hi>their words,</hi> as <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>their
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49587:85"/>
actions</hi>) to shew them to be as <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> as he should be thought by Mr. <hi>Cr. friendly</hi>; who should <hi>revile</hi> and <hi>persecute</hi> him all wayes imaginable for <hi>Non-conformity</hi>; and then should thus manifest to all the world <hi>his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness</hi> to him, should engage <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes</hi> of his powerful and enraged <hi>Enemies,</hi> in <hi>a Covenant</hi> to defend Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> in defence of the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of <hi>the Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> A <hi>Parenthesis</hi> would be in Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> Eye, a slender ground of our <hi>good will</hi> toward him. This is not only the natural and practised mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that <hi>phrase,</hi> but the confessed and owned one, Mr. <hi>Cr. Legislators, the Commons,</hi> in Answer to the <hi>Scotch Commissioners</hi> 28. <hi>November</hi> 1646. <hi>p.</hi> 21. acknowledge and plead for this sense of those dangerous words, [<hi>They are to preserve the King,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Relatively,</hi> viz. <hi>In the preservation of,</hi> &amp;c.] And frequently in that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, blame <hi>the Scots,</hi> for men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning

                  <hi>the Preservation of the King,</hi> and omitting that clause upon which they were bound to <hi>defend him.</hi> This being then the natural and confessed meaning of those words, and, in Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> own jugdement, <hi>sinful, p.</hi> 103. Because, as he truly there urges, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, and so the preserving the Kings Person and Authority, is an absolute duty founded in the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without regard to the Quality, Piety or Impiety of the Person,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And this is a duty we are bound to God to perform.</hi> If there were no more against <hi>the Covenant</hi> then this, Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> must acknowledge <hi>the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> to be as to <hi>the matter, unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>; and so in his own esteem ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging to nothing but <hi>Repentance:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it endeavours to <hi>bind</hi> us to to what he owns to be <hi>sin.</hi> But if this which Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> is ashamed to own, (either because he takes it not to be <hi>true,</hi> or else not <hi>seasonable</hi>) be not the true meaning of those
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49587:86"/>
words, and <hi>the King</hi> for <hi>misusing his Authority</hi> is not to be <hi>deprived</hi>; nay, even then they <hi>swear</hi> to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve</hi> it.

                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:49587:87"/>To the fourth Article, The Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, It will <hi>protect Impiety,</hi> and <hi>necessitate Barbarism</hi>; it layes <hi>a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity</hi> on the Son to <hi>accuse</hi> his Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and makes way for those who are <hi>sick</hi> of <hi>their Fathers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To which the Reply is, <hi>p.</hi> 104. <hi>All penal Statutes for Felony, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, The Oath of Allegiance, Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, the Protestation, the Law</hi> Deuteronomy, 13.6.7, 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>do the same.</hi> As to the Law of the Land; it looks upon <hi>the harbour Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals</hi> receive from <hi>near Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> in some cases, as <hi>duty:</hi> which it would severely and might justly <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> in others not so <hi>related,</hi> as <hi>a crime.</hi> But not to stand on that, at the very first reading, this Article sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests a considerable difference, from all the above-mentioned Instances.

               </p>
               <p>There is another Exception, which though Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> pleases to slight, I will be bold to say, all the Earth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not answer it, <hi>viz.</hi> That it <hi>betrays</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably, <hi>The Liberty of the Subject.</hi> We there swear to maintain in setting up an <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> when all the Rule they are to go by, is, [<hi>As they think convenient</hi>] which Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers by saying nothing to it.

               <p>To the fifth Article, It is said first, That there is a false Assertion, <hi>These Kingdoms</hi> (if <hi>Ireland</hi> be one, as in the former Parliaments it is) <hi>are not at Peace,</hi> nor dare the men of <hi>Oxf.</hi> abusively <hi>thank God</hi> for <hi>a blessing</hi> they do not all <hi>believe,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> proves by no better Argument, then that <hi>England</hi> &amp; <hi>Scotland</hi> entered in <hi>Covenant.</hi> As to <hi>the Peace</hi> which was between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> made by both <hi>Parliaments,</hi> I ask, <hi>If the Power</hi> of <hi>War</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> be not solely <hi>the Kings?</hi> If so, here

               <p>As to the second <hi>Remora,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> asks where <hi>this Covenant is defective towards the Kings Rights</hi> &amp;c?

               </p>
               <p>The very design of all their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, which <hi>this Covenant</hi> was a main Engine to effect, was perfect <hi>dethroning him,</hi> when they made what <hi>the Law,</hi> what <hi>their Wit,</hi> the foundation of all <hi>their Power:</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but <hi>his Counsel, his Controllers.</hi> And this is a Truth so clear, that they durst not for shame but call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>his Subjects</hi>; even when they <hi>exercised all</hi> but <hi>the Name</hi> of <hi>his Soveraign.</hi> When they <hi>raised Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> to <hi>compel</hi>; even then they made a resemblance of <hi>their duty</hi> by send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Petitions</hi> to <hi>beseech.</hi> They could not be <hi>Rebels,</hi> but in the style of

               <p>I am so far reconciled to this <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute depriving the King</hi> of <hi>his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> that I like it much better than the prety knack of <hi>sharing</hi> it between <hi>him</hi> and <hi>two equal Houses,</hi> which would be the worst Government in the world.

Or if I am not bound to the <hi>Scottish pattern</hi>; How shall I bring the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to <hi>Uniformity,</hi> not only in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> but <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Church-Goverment, Directory</hi> for <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>Catechizing</hi>; and how preserve that in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which I swear to do, and yet set up another in <hi>England,</hi> which in that case I am sworn to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so?</p>
               <p>But because Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 129. <hi>The Covenant hath not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined which is the best reformed Church,</hi> &amp;c. I would fain know, whether these three terms we are
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49587:91"/>
equally sworn to, [<hi>The Word of God, the best Reformed Churches, Uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with</hi> Scotland] are three expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of <hi>the same Rule,</hi> or of <hi>different ones.</hi> If of <hi>the same</hi>; then it is not true, what Mr. <hi>Crofton</hi> being put to his shifts, sayes, because it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly determined, <hi>viz. Scotland.</hi> If of <hi>different</hi>; With what Conscience can we <hi>swear to all,</hi> when by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our <hi>Oath</hi> to any <hi>one,</hi> we do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily break that part of it which was taken to <hi>another?</hi> and in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, observing in it any <hi>one,</hi> is <hi>break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> it to both <hi>the other? The Covenant</hi> obligeth us to <hi>reform England</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>the best Reformed Church,</hi> but determines not which it is, as Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> acknowledges. The reason of which is clear; because by that <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedness,</hi> they <hi>engaged all Sects</hi> to them, when, by declaring their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they had <hi>engaged but one:</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>one</hi> by this means; who was for <hi>the Covenant, the Covenant</hi> was for
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:49587:91"/>
him; and such ambiguity sure is not an <hi>Oath,</hi> but <hi>a Iuggle.</hi> But from this proceeds another Ambiguity, <hi>Who are the common Enemies?</hi> &amp;c. How shall I know, who are <hi>Enemies to the best Reformed Church,</hi> if I know not <hi>which is so?</hi> Can I prosecute any as an <hi>Enemy</hi> to <hi>the best reformed</hi> as <hi>such,</hi> and know it <hi>not?</hi> or, shall I tell him, I know him to be an <hi>Enemy</hi> to I know <hi>not what?</hi> Mr. <hi>Cr. p.</hi> 128. waves this Plea, and assures us, That <hi>the words plainly run to the Church of</hi> Scotland, <hi>&amp;c. and Independents by their enmity to the Church of</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>are our common Enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Explication I must needs say, fits <hi>the meaning</hi> of <hi>the Covenanters,</hi> and the <hi>no meaning</hi> of <hi>the Covenant.</hi> In different Pages, it is as in different States of Affairs: one while <hi>the best Reformed Church</hi> is not determined; another while it is plainly <hi>Scotland.</hi> If <hi>Independents</hi> were <hi>common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> sure it was from <hi>the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:49587:92"/>
they received <hi>Arms</hi> and <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> There is a <hi>Contradiction</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the <hi>Oxf.</hi> men, which I thought not to have considered, which because Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> professes not to <hi>see,</hi> I shall shew it him out of himself. It is,</p>
               <p>We are bound <hi>absolutely,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>exception</hi> to <hi>preserve,</hi> and yet, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>supposition,</hi> to <hi>extirpate</hi> the present <hi>Religion</hi> in <hi>the Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi> To which Mr. <hi>Cr. p.</hi> 131. <hi>That Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position must be plainly expressed in the Covenant to make it a contradict<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Oath, which is not done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The best way of proving <hi>a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> is, to lay the <hi>Propositions</hi> contended so to be, together; which will clearly (if they are so) shew themselves.</p>
               <p>Thus then,</p>
               <p>We are absolutely bound to preserve the Doctrine and Discipline, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are to bring the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:49587:92"/>
(of which <hi>Scotland</hi> is one) to Uniformity in Doctrine and Discipline.</p>
               <p>We are to reform <hi>2. England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> according to the best Reformed Church. <hi>See the first Article of the Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Covenant asserts not which are the best Reformed Churches; but binds the Covenanters to reform <hi>England</hi> whatever shall appear to be the best Reformed Church. <hi>Cr. p. 129.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus then,</p>
               <p>The first Proposition binds us to <hi>preserve the Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> absolutely. The second to bring the <hi>English Church,</hi> and the <hi>Scottish Church,</hi> to an <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> in <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Discipline.</hi> The third to <hi>reform England</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>the best Reformed Church.</hi> The fourth assures us, that <hi>the Covenant</hi> asserts not <hi>Scotland</hi> to be <hi>the best Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church</hi>; but binds to <hi>reform
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:49587:93"/>
England</hi> according to whatever shall <hi>appear</hi> to be so. Now then, if <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> doth not <hi>appear</hi> to be <hi>the best Reformed Church</hi>; the third Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition binds me to <hi>alter</hi> what the first binds me absolutely to <hi>maintain.</hi> If I am obliged to make <hi>the same thing exactly</hi> after <hi>several Patterns</hi>; if they happen not to be <hi>exactly the same,</hi> I must necessarily, in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>one,</hi> differ so much from the <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> as I follow that which <hi>differs</hi>; for to <hi>agree</hi> with what <hi>differs,</hi> is sure so far to <hi>differ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I perceive <hi>the Covenant</hi> is, as it was at first, urged to <hi>several men,</hi> so as to comply with their <hi>several humors,</hi> and <hi>interests.</hi> The <hi>well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>undiscerning Populacy</hi> they now (as they did formerly, before things were ripe) engage to <hi>the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> and tell them those <hi>horrid Consequences</hi> deduced from it, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long</hi> not to it; but afterwards en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage men to them by vertue of <hi>the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49587:93"/>
Covenant</hi> they have taken, whose Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation never fully <hi>appears</hi> til <hi>due sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi> Their first aim is at that part, which is least guarded, <hi>Religion:</hi> which being that wherein most are least con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, is their first attempt. Because <hi>the Church</hi> would not <hi>pull down</hi> the <hi>State</hi>; the <hi>State</hi> must <hi>pull down</hi> the <hi>Church.</hi> But what followed? They who perswaded that <hi>the Nobles,</hi> &amp; <hi>Prelates,</hi> were nor <hi>good enough</hi> to be their <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals</hi>; made it out, that <hi>Coblers</hi> and <hi>Draymen</hi> were <hi>good enough</hi> to be their <hi>Masters.</hi> And besides <hi>the Grandees</hi> who acted in that <hi>change,</hi> the whole <hi>Party</hi> were as forward to own <hi>the other House,</hi> as ready at any time to take <hi>the other Oath.</hi> I very well know, many will not, in spite of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Experience,</hi> be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but that <hi>reforming the Church</hi> is the <hi>sole aim</hi> of <hi>the Covenanters.</hi> In the <hi>new sense</hi> of <hi>reforming, the Church-Lands</hi> being already in their opinion <hi>disposed of, Reformation</hi> must
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49587:94"/>
begin at <hi>the State:</hi> and surely, it is great pity, but, they who will not <hi>beware</hi> by the <hi>examples of others,</hi> should be made <hi>examples to others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second Article of <hi>the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> is only talked of: and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the concernment</hi> of <hi>the Church</hi>; others think themselves not <hi>interessed in.</hi> But he who considers, that they are in the sixth Article sworn, never to be <hi>wrought off,</hi> no, not so much as to an <hi>indifferency</hi> or <hi>neutrality</hi>; but <hi>zealously</hi> and <hi>constantly</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight of all impediments, <hi>pursue</hi> all they have <hi>sworn:</hi> And that in the fourth Article, they swear to <hi>bring all to punishment,</hi> who have been <hi>Malignants</hi> (Which words signifie what <hi>they please,</hi>) and expresly all who have acted contrary to <hi>the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>; and they to be <hi>punished</hi> as <hi>the Supream Iudicatories</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> no doubt <hi>the two Houses,</hi> who are no <hi>Court</hi> at all) or others from them shall <hi>think fit:</hi> will find <hi>the Cavaliers</hi> in
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49587:94"/>
an ill case; nay, all who at any time did any thing which was ever Voted <hi>Malignancy</hi> by <hi>the two Houses.</hi> The ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of whose Sentence (they not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a now capacity to <hi>pardon</hi> being <hi>dissolved</hi>) must be now executed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>the first opportunity</hi>; nor must they at all question <hi>the reasonableness</hi> or <hi>legality,</hi> because the Rule is, <hi>As they,</hi> or <hi>any from them</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> their Committees) <hi>shall think convenient.</hi> One thing I shall observe, that though the Parliament may be trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>act arbitrarily,</hi> beside or against <hi>the Law,</hi> (which they are not); yet that they may delegate such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant power, over <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,</hi> as is here mentioned, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others (though men of such <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and <hi>Fortunes,</hi> as our <hi>Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees</hi> were) who were to make <hi>Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> by whom they might <hi>thrive,</hi> having nothing to <hi>grow rich</hi> with, but an <hi>ill Conscience</hi> and other mens

               </p>
               <p>I have before observed, That that <hi>Invitation</hi> in the conclusion to <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Churches,</hi> (where there are no Parliaments with pretence of <hi>share in the Power,</hi>) must be to them confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly as <hi>Subjects</hi>: whom notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing they <hi>absolve</hi> from <hi>their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance.</hi> Though it is not delivered in Scripture, that <hi>freedom</hi> from a <hi>Master</hi> or <hi>Prince</hi> who is <hi>a Heathen,</hi> is any part of that <hi>liberty</hi> wherein Christ hath <hi>installed us</hi>; and so is sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious. Having shewed it to be against <hi>Duty,</hi> I will in a word shew it to be against <hi>our Interest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It engages us to pursue (by the way of <hi>the Sword,</hi> as their <hi>Practice</hi>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:49587:95"/>
and <hi>the Invitation</hi> in the conclusion shews) all we have sworn to, all our dayes: which is, [<hi>Whatever is contrary to the power of Godliness</hi>]. So then, Every man is to <hi>slay his brother,</hi> who <hi>commits</hi> any <hi>sin</hi> that deserves it: so <hi>many Covenanters,</hi> so <hi>many Commissioned Officers.</hi> There is <hi>a Tribunal</hi> in every <hi>brest</hi> to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn</hi> and <hi>execute both.</hi> And if their <hi>Oath</hi> obligeth them to any <hi>thing,</hi> it doth to <hi>this</hi>; they being equally sworn to all the other Articles, though that alone takes up all their thoughts. What <hi>horrid effects</hi> there would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low hence, themselves would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>feel:</hi> should they thus begin to assert <hi>the Covenant,</hi> themselves would quickly find its <hi>edge:</hi> They who set <hi>a house</hi> on <hi>fire,</hi> themselves be soon made a part of that <hi>fire.</hi> It is not then more <hi>dishonourable</hi> to <hi>God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious</hi> to <hi>the King,</hi> and the <hi>Nation:</hi> then it would, if <hi>pursued,</hi> be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
