            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat you were pleaſed to deſire might be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed; I deſire you would be pleaſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this dedication of; both as an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the power you have to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me, and as a teſtimony of my thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to you for your many favours to my ſelf, and your tranſcendent beneficence unto the Colledge whereunto I ſtand related: The particulars where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I ſhould have diſplayed, but that I know that this were the ready way to unbeſpeak your acceptance; nor indeed can I hope that this poore paper will ever be able to out-wing that Fame which is already gone forth; or to come into the hands of any, whoſe ears have not been already filled with the report of ſo noble, ſo pious, and ſo ſeaſonable a gift. For, the perfume of this <hi>box of coſtly ointment,</hi> which you have expended to further the preaching and propagation of the Goſpel, hath already <hi>filled the whole houſe</hi> of the preſent age, and ſhall make your <hi>name</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>as an ointment poured forth,</hi> embalming it to all ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generations: For, <hi>this which you have done ſhall</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after <hi>be told for a memoriall</hi> of you; yea, <hi>whereſoever the Goſpel ſhall be preached</hi> by thoſe who ſhall have been bred up here by your bounty, even there ſhall the ſouls of many have cauſe to bleſſe and glorifie God on your behalf. But I may go no farther, leſt I ſhould tranſgreſſe and break truce with your humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48643:3"/>As for the ſubject of this diſcourſe, it is none other than what hath been often inſiſted upon at large by many of our learned and judicious Divines, whoſe books I am not worthy, and whoſe works I am not able to carry after them. But I do not at all fear that it will be any whit the leſſe acceptable unto your ſelf, who love the good old way of ſober truth, however many now a dayes do thirſt after novelty; a good account (I think) may be given of both from that of our Saviour, Luke 5. 39. <hi>No man having drunk old wine ſtraightway deſireth new; for, he ſaith the old is better</hi>; nor yet will it, I hope, be altogether uſeleſſe unto others, ſeeing S. Peter thought good in both his Epiſtles, <hi>to ſtirre up the pure minds</hi> of believers <hi>by way of remembrance,</hi> 2 Pet.3. 1. and we therefore indeavour to underſtand truths, that we may be able to call them to mind in the time of our need: So that what wants novelty to recommend it to our fanſies and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, may yet prove welcome unto our conſciences, and may be both profitable and acceptable, becauſe ſeaſonable.</p>
            <p>And indeed, Sir, that which firſt made me pitch my thoughts upon this ſubject, was the ſad conſideration of that giddineſſe and drunkenneſſe of spirit in matters of Religion, which ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in theſe our dayes are diſtempered withall, running to and fro, and ſtaggering like a drunken man, out of one opinion into another; and yet after all their ſeekings, they are ſtill to ſeek for the truth, the way whereof they have not known. Many cauſes hereof might be assigned; two I ſhall deſire your leave here to remember and make mention of.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> I do impute and charge this <hi>Vertigo</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grime</hi> in religion, this unfaithfulneſſe to truth, upon the account of newfangledneſſe, that <hi>pica</hi> of our nature, the unreaſonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and love of <hi>novelty,</hi> which is ſo very much predominant in theſe our times, as if S. Paul's propheſie were now fulfilled in the <hi>eares</hi> of many, (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3, 4.) <hi>For, the time will come when they will not indure ſound doctrine, but after their
<pb facs="tcp:48643:3"/>
own luſts ſhall they heap to themſelves teachers, having itching eares, And they ſhall turn away their eares from the truth, and ſhall be turned unto fables.</hi> Let a man that is a ſetter-forth of new opinions but open his ſhop, and how doth the multitude throng about him! like thoſe Athenians that took S. Paul to be ſuch a one, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.19. <hi>Saying, may we know what this new doctrine, which thou ſpeakeſt, is? for, thou bringeſt certain ſtrange things to our eares; we would know therefore what theſe things mean. For,</hi> (we muſt know that) <hi>all the Athenians and ſtrangers, which were there, ſpent their time in nothing elſe, but either to tell or heare ſome new thing</hi>). But ſuch as deſire news onely becauſe it is news, will not much care whether it be true or falſe; and thoſe that judge of truth by the newneſſe of it, may fall into ten errours e're they light upon one truth; <hi>Antiquiry</hi> is no ſufficient mark of truth, (witneſſe the Gibeonites, who had old ſhoes on their feet, and mouldy bread in their hands, and yet at the ſame time brought a lie in their mouths) much leſſe is <hi>novelty</hi>; for, Truth is of the elder houſe; and as for thoſe that entertain truth onely becauſe it is new, though it be truth which they entertain, yet are they not like to keep it long; for, it will not be long new. It is much if a news-book be reade over twice: The Athenian news-mongers made account they favoured S. Paul highly, when they promiſed to heare him tell his ſtory over again a ſecond time, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 32. A ſecond-hand truth? away with it to the brokers. Thus children and fools were ever admirers of new clothes; and that which was alwayes the praiſe of an Almanack, is now become with theſe men the onely taking qualification of doctrine and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. That luxury went high that had every day a new ſuite, and theſe can ſcarce think themſelves right dreſt, unleſſe they have dayly new <hi>changes</hi> of opinions. But ſince the Devil knows their humour ſo well, they ſhall want for no news, ſo long as his invention can afford it; and when that fails, the old ſerpent
<pb facs="tcp:48643:4"/>
knows how to ſlip his skin, and that which is old in it ſelf will be new to them; blanch but an <hi>old Arrian,</hi> and out comes a <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian</hi> ſpick and ſpan <hi>new.</hi> And indeed, what are moſt of our <hi>new-lights,</hi> but <hi>old-hereſies,</hi> the Devils old cards plaid over again, and the pieces of the old Serpent crawling to find one another from under the Anathema's of foregoing ages?</p>
            <p>But a <hi>ſecond</hi> cauſe to which I think the unſettledneſſe of many men may be juſtly imputed, is their not being well-grounded in the firſt principles of Religion. <hi>Some</hi> never were catechiſed at all, but have been nurſed up in groſſe and palpable ignorance; no wonder if ſuch as have no ballaſt at all in them, be made the ſport and paſtime of every wind of doctrine; no wonder if ſuch as have been bred all their lives time in a dungeon, do become dizzie, and count all light new when they come firſt into it. My ſelf have known ſome, that much cryed up for new diſcoveries ſome crude and raw apprehenſions of thoſe very truths, which others, who had the happineſſe of better education, had been very well acquainted with, and grounded in from their child-hood. But <hi>others</hi> there are, who have learned the truth more by rode than by heart, and received it from other men upon their bare word, without ſeeing any evidence for it. Theſe men when they come once to ſee an appearance of reaſon for the contrary opinion, (which is more than ever themſelves had for the taking up of truth) it is not much to be wondred at, if ſuch are eaſily drawn aſide to errour; and then it is but very natural for them to call errour <hi>light,</hi> and to condemn truth for <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> becauſe they never underſtood it: And then if a little pride get but in once (as it is never farre of) to mix with their ignorance, how eaſy a thing is it for them to grow conceited of their new attainments (which yet wiſer men cannot but pitty them for) to deſpiſe the truth (which before they did but raviſh), and to inveigh againſt thoſe who formerly taught it them; calling them <hi>blind guides,</hi> whereas the fault was, themſelves had been <hi>blind followers,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48643:4"/>
and ſuppoſing them to have no ground for the truth, becauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed themſelves never had any: yea and to loath the very ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances in which the truth had been diſpenſed to them. Thus the beſt food, if it lie on the ſtomach undigeſted, is oftimes vomited up again with the greateſt abhorrency and deteſtation. What a ſad condition have thoſe men brought themſelves into! A ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of errour hath not onely taken <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> of them, but hath alſo <hi>bolted</hi> himſelf in, and made them hate the very means of their recovery: By this time the Devil hath got ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding power over them, that he drives them about in herds and droves, as he doth the <hi>Quakers</hi> at this day. Who, that it might be apparent unto all men that they are ſeduced, are become mere <hi>Vagrants.</hi> Whereas had they at firſt entertained <hi>truth</hi> upon good grounds, they would never have proved ſo <hi>falſe</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; had it taken due <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> of them, or they of it; they would never thus have quitted <hi>houſe and home,</hi> to be carried about like <hi>empty clouds,</hi> and <hi>wandring ſtarres,</hi> which, though they may pretend unto <hi>new light,</hi> yet are they faſt bound in chains of darkneſſe, and unleſſe they do timely repent, S. <hi>Jude</hi> tells us what their doom ſhall be, verſe 13. <hi>To whom is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the blackneſſe of darkneſſe for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now then, <hi>Sir,</hi> Since the danger is ſo great, what need have we all, as to beg of God that he by his Spirit would keep us ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in the truth, ſo alſo our ſelves to neglect no means that may be available thereunto; among which I conceive this one to be none of the leaſt, that we endeavour to underſtand our ſelves well in our religion, to ſee truth in clear Scripture-evidence, to be <hi>intelligent</hi> and <hi>knowing,</hi> not <hi>merely-believing</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to be rooted and well-grounded in the Faith, ſo ſhall we be ſteàfaſt and unmoveable. For which end if it ſhall pleaſe God to make this diſcourſe in any meaſure profitable (as I hope it is not altogether unſeaſonable) unto his people; neither ſhall I
<pb facs="tcp:48643:5"/>
have any cauſe to repent myſelf that I ran this adventure, nor you to be ſorry that you have undergone the trouble of this dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. And thus, Sir, I take my leave, recommending you to the gracious protection of the Almighty, and to the riches of his love in our Lord Chriſt Jeſus.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> if he can, by detaining them in groſſe and palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ignorance, thoſe <hi>chains of darkneſſe.</hi> Thus doth he the Turks and Indians to this very day; and many millions of ſouls under the Papacy, by a blind obedience and as blind a faith, the <hi>Coliers faith</hi> they call it, I doubt 'twill come to th' fire at the laſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If this will not do but men will needs be know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then he labours to ſeduce them into errour, giving them husks for bread, <hi>pro Deâ nubem.</hi> This old deceiver wants not his <hi>ſtrophae,</hi> nor his methods. He will <hi>Proteus</hi>-like ſcrew himſelf into all modes and figures that ſo he may the better deceive. Sometimes he aſſumes the ſhape of an <hi>Oecumenicall Biſhop,</hi> and dictates errours out of an infallible chair, intoxicating with the cup of his errours the <hi>Kings</hi> of the earth: otherwhile putting on the appearance of a <hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple plain man,</hi> he creeps into houſes, and the greateſt game he flies at are but <hi>ſilly women.</hi> One while he preſents errour under the reverend cloak of <hi>antiquity</hi>; anon he bethinks
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48643:6"/>
himſelf that the neweſt faſhion will give beſt content, and ſo they ſhall be <hi>new lights.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If both theſe fail, then he raiſes a duſt of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, that ſo people may not be able to ſee the truth, or not to know it when they ſee it. He finds it good fiſhing in troubled waters, and cutting purſes in an hubub: For, while people are diſtracted to ſee ſo many opinions in religion, whereof they are ſure but one can be true, (and which that is they are not able to judge) they reſolve to be ſtanders-by untill the learned be agreed, ſuppoſing it the ſafeſt courſe and eaſieſt to avoid errour, by being of no opinion at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Another device he hath, to bring truth it ſelf into ſuſpicion. Thus of old did he ſet the Poets on work to invent fables like unto many hiſtories recorded in holy Scriptures, that when the falſhood of thoſe ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, the truth of theſe might be call'd in queſtion. Juſt as he makes ſome play the hypocrites, that when their hypocriſie is detected, all profeſſours may be thought to be like them.</p>
            <p>But let us argue <hi>è contra.</hi> If the Scripture were not true, ſure the devil would never ſeek to gain credit to his lies by imitating of it. It's an argument that there is true coin in the world, becauſe men counterfeit it: had there never been ſuch an one as <hi>Richard Plantagenet,</hi> we had never heard of <hi>Perkin Warbeck.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reject not therefore all coin; for, there is ſome good; receive not all heedleſſely, becauſe there is ſome counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit; but bring it all to the teſt, and to the touch-ſtone. To think that we muſt therefore be of no opinion becauſe others are of ſo many, is to be of the worſt opinion of all: for, whoſo adheres to a particular opinion, may ineed be ith' wrong; but he that is of no opinion cannot poſſibly be ith' right. If other men do ſo differ in their opinions, it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48643:6"/>
concerns us to be well-reſolved in our own judgements. If the winds and waves be ſo boiſterous without, the more need is there of a good ballaſt within. All cannot have the truth, therefore make them not thy rule; yet all pretend to it, therefore give them an hearing. Condemn not all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there's truth among them; neither approve all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome muſt needs be falſe. Let us therefore neither ſwallow all by a blind credulitie, nor reject all by a raſh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitancy, but follow the advice of the Apoſtle in the text; <hi>Prove all things,</hi> but <hi>hold faſt that which is good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words contain in them a double dutie which all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are bound unto; as well the people as their paſtours, every one in their ſeverall orbe: Although more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately they ſeem to be directed to the people, who in the words immediately foregoing are forbidden to deſpiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſyings, and here are bid to trie them all, and to hold faſt that which is good. Of both theſe in their order. Firſt of the firſt.</p>

               <p>For the <hi>firſt,</hi> By <hi>proving</hi> or trying here is <hi>not</hi> meant that we ſhould <hi>experimentally</hi> be of all opinions; many ſuch ſeekers inſtead of finding truth, have loſt themſelves in a maze of errour, and an inextricable labyrinth of perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.

Nor is it meant that we ſhould all <hi>judices agere in foro externo</hi> ſit and determine controverſies, binding up all others to acquieſce in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions: but, as it concerns all Chriſtians (<hi>quà tales</hi>), to <hi>prove</hi> or try is an act of judgement to be exerciſed by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48643:7"/>
one within the private court of his own conſcience in order to his own particular embracing or rejecting of any doctrine offered to his faith. Which act is no further obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory to any other man, than the grounds thereof being made known ſhall merit his aſſent.</p>
               <p>But <hi>ſecondly,</hi> what are we here to underſtand by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>all things</hi>; muſt we examine all things? ſurely then we ſhall have work enough. If we muſt alwayes be examining, what will become of all holy living? I <hi>anſwer,</hi> a man may live by rule, as well as build by rule. But further, Though we muſt try <hi>all</hi> things here meant, yet is it not meant that we ſhould be <hi>alwayes</hi> trying of them. But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Truth fears no fair triall; her face is not painted, and therefore the fairer for the waſhing; &amp; ſhe is juſtified of her children, yet is ſhe ſometimes condemned by ſtrangers that know her not; and her face may poſſibly get a ſcratch in the ſcuffle, and herſelf prove (though perhaps more fair, yet) in the mean while leſſe fruitfull; and therefore deſires not to live alwayes under diſpute. And indeed ſome truths ſeem by their own nature to be exempt from, triall; there muſt be ſome <hi>baſis</hi> to move upon, and that muſt be immoveable; <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48643:7"/>
their very faces; yet I know not how of late ſome out of the abundance of their leiſure or curioſitie have been pleaſed to queſtion them. We lately digged for fundamentall <hi>laws</hi> till we had like to have pulled the houſe down about our ears; and ſome have digged for principles in <hi>philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> till they have quite loſt them in the rubbiſh; certainly the man was either very idle or very melancholick when he began to ſuſpect he might be deceived in thinking he had a being (which yet was impoſſible), and came to <hi>Cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ergò ſum.</hi> But, that which is worſe yet, have we not ſome who call in queſtion the very fundamentals of <hi>religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> alſo? they are but bad builders, who, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, are alwayes <hi>laying</hi> the foundation; when then ſhall we think that they will ſet on the roof and bring the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to perfection who are alwayes <hi>digging of it up</hi>? I ſhall ſay no more; but I had thought the truth of the ſcriptures had been out of gun-ſhot, and that God might have been believed upon his own word. If once it appeare to us to be the word of God, we are not to call in queſtion the truth or equity of it. Let us not ſpend our time in calling thoſe truths into queſtion, whereof we have already enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a firm and well-grounded belief, but preſſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards toward thoſe things which remain, and practiſe what we have believed. The blowing of this wind makes the tree take deeper root, (and it is well if it doth alwayes ſo) but yet in the mean while it oftimes blowes down the fruit. But what is it then that we muſt try? <hi>try the ſpirits,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>John</hi> 1. 4. 1. and try <hi>propheſyings</hi> mentioned here in the verſe before my text; the ſenſe and meaning is one and the ſame of both, try all doctrines that are offered to you by any man whatſoever, how great, how learned ſoever he be, receive them not upon his <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note> The <hi>Bereans</hi> were but <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners</hi> and had not yet entertained the faith, and therefore might examine: but ſuch as are already Chriſtians and believe the Churche's infallibility are bound to believe the doctrine it propoſeth, without examination.</p>

bind them. But <hi>ſecondly,</hi> If all be beginners but thoſe that believe <hi>that,</hi> truly for our parts We Proteſtants do profeſſe our ſelves to be <hi>Bereans,</hi> and therefore I hope he will give <hi>Us</hi> leave to examine their doctrine in the balance of the Sanctuary, and ſo we have and found it light. And <hi>third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> is <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſure the <hi>Bereans</hi> were not believers when they ſearched? ſince <hi>they received the word with all readineſſe of mind,</hi> (and then 'tis added) <hi>and ſearched the Scriptures daily whether thoſe things were ſo.</hi> But <hi>fourthly,</hi> If they were not, I wonder how men before they beleive ſhould be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to judge than afterwards; and how they ſhould come to looſe that power and priviledge by beleiving.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe there are many other Scriptures, which do <hi>ex conſequenti</hi> not onely permit, but alſo require to try the doctrines before we entertain them: as <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 4. where our Saviour bids <hi>See that no man ſeduce you</hi>: and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>Let no man deceive you with vain words</hi>: and 2 <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Let no man deceive you by any means.</hi> To what purpoſe are all theſe monitory cautions, if we may not try; nay, do they not implicitly require and <hi>command</hi> us to try and examine the doctrines, whoever they be that bring them? S. <hi>Paul</hi> is bold in <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8, 9. <hi>Though we or an Angel from heaven ſhould preach any other Goſpel, let him be</hi>

                  </gap>. And that you may ſee that this expreſſion proceeded neither from raſhneſſe nor paſſion, but a moſt adviſed and well reſolved deliberation, he repeats the words in the verſe following: <hi>As we ſaid before, ſo ſay I now again; If any preach any other Goſpel unto you than that you have received, let him be accurſed.</hi> Whence I obſerve theſe two things to my preſent purpoſe; <hi>firſt,</hi> that there muſt be an <hi>examen,</hi> elſe how could they know it was <hi>another</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and ſo reject it? and <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that the hearers as ſuch, and not teachers were to be the judges, unleſſe wee'l ſay they were bound to curſe themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:48643:9"/>But the truth in hand may be further evidenced to us by <hi>reaſon</hi> thus: Becauſe we muſt neither embrace all doctrines,<note place="margin">

               <p>1. We muſt not reject all; for, ſo we ſhall be ſure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the truth; and beſides, we do ow ſo much reverence to the name of God, as not raſhly to reject without <hi>examen,</hi> any doctrine that hath but an appearance of any juſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence unto it.</p>
               <p>2. Nor may we embrace all promiſcuouſly; for, ſo we ſhall be ſure to be in the wrong; and I ſee not how poſſibly the ſoul can at the ſame time aſſent unto contradictions, and yet ſuch there are found among opinions.</p>
               <p>3. Nor in the third place may we take up a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of opinions as they come next to hand, as they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to us by the place where we live, or the next comer by: for, ſo there will be great danger of falling into errour, and truth is of more concernment to us, than that we ſhould adventure it upon the hazard of ſuch a contingency.</p>
               <p>4. Nor laſtly may we entertain truth it ſelf (if we ſhould happen on it) on ſo ſlight grounds; if we take no better hold of it, we ſhall never be able to hold it faſt: If we build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch a ſandie foundation, how do we think to ſtand, when the winds and waves of temptation and perſecution ſhall ariſe? It remains therefore that we muſt examine, that ſo we may both refuſe the evil, and alſo hold faſt that which is good. And for the further quickning of us unto this duty, I ſhall propound onely two conſiderations, and very briefly.</p>

               <p>This is that <hi>donum intellectûs</hi> and <hi>illumination,</hi> which is beſtowed upon every believer at his firſt converſion, though in a leſſer meaſure both of evidence and object than after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: for, it grows and increaſes according to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith which God hath dealt to every man, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends itſelf as large as a divine faith does, from which it is inſeparable.

might adde alſo in the <hi>third</hi> place, that the ſoul muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with a ſincere love of the truth, that it muſt obey the truth, and mortifie its own corruptions: but of theſe more conveniently afterwards.</p>
               <p>Thus much may ſuffice for the firſt thing required that we may judge aright, a faculty rightly prepared.</p>
               <p>2.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Requiſite A Rule.</hi>
                  </note> The ſecond is the <hi>Rule</hi> according to which we muſt judge, by which we muſt examine all doctrines, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their agreeing or diſagreeing with it, either en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain or reject them.</p>
               <p>This rule muſt be (1.) in it ſelf infallible, (2.) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of us clear and known, (3.) in reſpect of the doctrines to be tryed it muſt be adequate. Theſe are agreed upon as neceſſary properties of a rule of divine faith.</p>
               <p>Now ſuch a rule are not</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Not, Reaſon</hi>
                  </note> the maxims of naturall reaſon. For, (1.) they are farre from being <hi>infallible,</hi> many of them being but the product of humane diſcourſe and fallible obſervation, and therefore ſome of them falſe, if they be extended beyond the ſphere of Philoſophy, for whoſe meridian onely they were calculated at the firſt. I do not think there is any truth in Philoſophy which contradicts any truth in Divinity; yet am I ſure that many ſayings are true in Philoſophy, which are falſe in Divinity. For, maxims and general rules being but collections obſerved from particulars, if the ſurvey be ſhort, <hi>ad nimis pauca reſpiciens,</hi> not taking in all particulars, the verdict or maxime muſt needs be defective, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule be liable to exceptions. So that a rule may be true in Philoſophy as to all thoſe particulars included within the object of Philoſophy, but falſe if ſtretched to take in the things of Divinitie: as an obſervation concerning men may be true of men in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> but falſe if applyed to thoſe in <hi>England,</hi> who were never attended to in the raiſing.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48643:12"/>
(2.) As theſe maxims are not infallible; ſo neither are they <hi>adequate</hi> to the things to be believed, and therefore cannot make a fit rule of divine faith. For there are many divine truths which are nothing at all of kind to any peice of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall knowledge, neither flowing from theſe maxims, nor being reducible to them. (3.) It is not poſſible for any of thoſe maxims to be the foundation of any divine faith at all; for, all aſſent that is wrought in the ſoul by them is but either ſcience or opinion; both which ariſe from the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the thing, whereas faith aſſents unto an article without any ſuch reſpect, but meerly for the ſake of a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; and if the faith be divine, ſuch alſo is the teſtimony which produceth it.</p>
               <p>And yet the <hi>Socinians</hi> make reaſon the rule of their faith. <hi>Quod abſurdum eſt rationi, debet eſſe falſum,</hi> ſaith one; others more modeſt or more ſubtile will ſeem to grant that reaſon ought to believe what <hi>God</hi> ſayes, be it never ſo contrary to their apprehenſions; but then when the queſtion is put whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>God</hi> ſay ſuch a thing or no, here they will deny it if it agree not with their maxims. Thus what they give with the one hand they take away again with the other; they paſſe it in the <hi>head,</hi> but ſtop it in the <hi>houſe</hi>; decline the volie but take the rebound, which comes all to one at laſt.</p>
               <p>But how little reaſon there is for ſo doing, eſpecially <hi>in hac foece Romali,</hi> in this Apoſtate and fallen condition of humane nature, the alone ſenſe of our own infirmities and weakneſſes may ſufficiently convince.</p>
               <p>O but yet <hi>Right</hi> Reaſon! Ay, where is it? many make account they have it, and that in thoſe very things wherein yet they contradict one another. Some think <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did but bid his ſcholer go look; when he made the judgement of a wiſeman the rule of vertues mediocritie; many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be wiſe, and many more think themſelves ſuch,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48643:12"/>
but it's ſeldome that either prove ſo. So that indeed a man may ſooner find vertue than a wiſe-man, eſpecially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that he had need to be one himſelf to know one when he meets him. All reaſon then is not right, nor have all men right reaſon, that think they have it; reaſon it ſelf then ſtands in need of a rule to be tryed by. Reaſon is then <hi>right</hi> when it is <hi>true,</hi> and then only true when it judgeth according to the truth of things themſelves; now things to be believed are contained in Scripture, let us carry our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thith'er, and trie it by them. For, as <hi>Ameſius</hi> very well. <hi>Ratio quaedicitur recta, ſi abſoluta rectitudo ſpectetur, non ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi nobis eſt quarenda quàm ubi exiſtit, id eſt, in Scripturis; neque differt</hi> (quatenus ſpectat bonum &amp; aequum) <hi>à vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntate Dei ad noſtrae vita directionem revelatâ. Mcdullae</hi> lib. 2. cap. 2.</p>
               <p>So then, although the <hi>maxims</hi> of natural reaſon may be of ſingular uſe in Divinity, if rightly limited by the Scriptures, yet are they not fit to be <hi>canon,</hi> they are both too ſhort and too weak to make a <hi>rule</hi> of divine faith of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>Antiquity.</hi>
                  </note> nor is <hi>Antiquity</hi> ſuch a rule as is required. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity</hi> barely conſidered is no good mark, much leſſe rule of truth. The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> in giving marks of the true Church do as Painters, who draw the Virgine Mary by their own Miſtreſſes; they do not chooſe the Church by her marks, but indeavour to make their marks by their Church: In like manner here, they do not ſquare their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine by the true rule, but ſtrive to find out a rule that will fit their doctrine, and yet herein too they are oft times much to ſeek.</p>
               <p>They cry up <hi>Antiquity</hi> very much, bidding us ask for the old way; for multitude of dayes ſhall teach us wiſdome; and make account they have praiſed themſelves all this
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48643:13"/>
while; but no ſuch matter, unleſſe we ſhould look at anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and nothing elſe: but then I know who may vie with them, the devil was a lier from the beginning. For our parts we profeſſe we do very much reverence antiquiry, but it muſt be then in conjunction with truth; we cannot admire old errours; but as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of the hoary head, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 31. <hi>The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteouſneſſe.</hi> We ſhall alwayes riſe up before a reverend hoary-headed truth; but we muſt have ſomething elſe beſides its gray hairs to know it by, leſt in ſtead of truth we ſalute her mask, and worſhip a cloud in ſtead of a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe. And as for the Papiſts, for all their boaſting ſo much of the antiquity of their doctrine, we can eaſily ſhew them who brought in this doctrine, and that doctrine into their Church; this ceremony and that ceremony, this corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and that corruption. We need no microſcope to ſee how patcht their coat is, of how different a thread and ſpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſo that it could never hang together, but that the new would rend the old in ſunder, the ſtrong the rotten, were it not for that ſame Catholick plaiſter of infallibility. But while we make the Scriptures to be our rule, our doctrine is ancienter than much of theirs pretends to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3. <hi>Councels and Fathers.</hi>
                  </note> not the writings of the Ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> nor Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of <hi>Councels,</hi> neither of theſe are fit to be made the <hi>rule</hi> of a divine faith. We do attribute much unto the judgements of thoſe ancient Fathers, thoſe primitive Saints and Worthies, whether expreſt in their private writings, or ſignified in lawfull Councels.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Councels</hi> were ſuch as they ought to be, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of holy, able, and learned Paſtours of the Church, we look upon them as bright conſtellations, whoſe light was the greater becauſe of their conjunction. They had not onely <hi>donum intellectûs,</hi> and that in a great meaſure too
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48643:13"/>
as they were ſingle Chriſtians; but alſo <hi>donum interpretatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> as they were Paſtours of the Church: and while they conferred together, ſeeking <hi>God,</hi> they were in the uſe of the beſt means to find out truth, and under a promiſe alſo, but not of infallibility; and therefore although we cannot make them the rule of our faith, yet ought we not raſhly to reject them when they are offered to us; nor to ſlight their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as if they were nothing worth, but ſeriouſly to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their reaſons and grounds on which they went.</p>
               <p>We honour the <hi>Fathers</hi> as men whom God's providence raiſed up and indued with gifts to quell the growing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of their times; and doubtleſſe if they were more lookt into, they would furniſh us with tried weapons, armour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to ſubdue the ſelf-ſame hereſies riſen again among us in theſe our dayes, and prove as ſucceſſefull as that ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem of the <hi>Scythians</hi> was, who put their rebel-ſlaves to flight, by but ſhewing them the rods where with they had been wont to whip them But though we <hi>honour</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet we dare not <hi>worſhip</hi> them, we may not believe in them, nor make their writings the rule of our faith. This is that which themſelves did never deſire, but forbid and abhorre the thought of; they ſeem to ſay to us, Stand up; for, we alſo were but men ſubject to like infirmities with you; <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. Worſhip <hi>God,</hi> believe in <hi>him.</hi> I doubt not but they that mended many faults in their own writings, left ſome behind, and I wiſh others had not added more. We admit them as witneſſes, but not as a rule, ſince they alſo were but fallible.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ha's boaſted ſo long of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, till at length they grow almoſt weary of it. At firſt they had like to have put the <hi>Centuriatours</hi> out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; but afterwards Biſhop <hi>Jewell</hi> was ſo bold as to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge them, in a Sermon at <hi>Paul's</hi> Croſſe, (afterward print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48643:14"/>
and to offer that if they could produce any one ancient Father, General Councel, or example of the Primitive Church for the firſt ſix hundred yeares, that ſided with them againſt us in any one of 27 articles by him named, and in controverſie between us, he would ſubſcribe to them. This challenge Dr. <hi>Humfryes</hi> thought was more than he needed to have made; yet having made it he made it good againſt <hi>Harding,</hi> and yet died a Proteſtant: and this was no more than we all promiſe, ſayes learned Dr. <hi>Whita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kar</hi> againſt <hi>Campian's</hi> fifth reaſon. So that the Jeſuite need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to have arrogated to the Church of Rome that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the Jews, <hi>Whoſe are the Fathers</hi>: and <hi>Malone</hi> might have ſpared his ſcurrilous title-page againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend and learned Primate; <hi>Though you have ten thouſand USHERS, yet have ye not many FATHERS.</hi> We boaſt not of ten thouſand, but are glad that we have one worth ten thouſand of their Popiſh-Fathers, and as many head-maſters of their ſchools to boot. But we hope we have the Fathers with us, and I am ſure we honour them more than they, and yet make them not the rule of our faith neither. They honour them not as Fathers, but as Lords and Maſters; as <hi>Peter Cotton</hi> was wont to call him, My Lord St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>At ſervum ſcis te genitum, blandéque fateris,</l>

                  </q>
Let them therefore be the vaſſals, if they pleaſe, while we are the true and genuine ſonnes of thoſe ancient Fathers. And yet ſome of the Papiſts (to ſay the truth) cared not overmuch for the judgement of the Fathers, when it made againſt them. Cardinal <hi>Cajetan</hi> will not fear to go againſt the generall torrent of all the ancient Doctours <note place="margin">

                  </note>; for which <hi>Canus</hi> indeed blames him, but then <hi>Andradius</hi> takes his part: and I am ſure what <hi>Cajetan</hi> ſaid, was no other than
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48643:14"/>
what was put in practiſe by <hi>Maldonate, Janſenius,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4. <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </note> Nor is the judgement or <hi>teſtimony of the Church</hi> a ſufficient rule of divine faith. The Papiſts cry up the <hi>Church,</hi> as much as the Jews of old did the <hi>Temple</hi>: but by the Church they mean their own; which, by that time the Jeſuites have done with it, is nothing elſe but the Pope. But wee'll keep their tearm <hi>the Church,</hi> whoſe teſtimony they ſay is infallible, and neceſſary to a divine faith of any one article in religion; and although <hi>de-Valentia</hi> and <hi>Canus</hi> would fain mince the matter, and make it onely neceſſary as a <hi>condition</hi>; yet that will not ſerve the Romaniſts turn, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>a-Sacro-boſco</hi> knew well enough, and therefore make the teſtimony of the Church neceſſary, as a <hi>medius terminus</hi> and <hi>Cauſe</hi> of aſſent in all divine faith; and ſo they muſt ſay or come over to us. Now infallibility as it is required to a rule of doctrine, is nothing elſe but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt, which the Papiſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a man to believe that their Church hath, before he can believe ſo much as that there is an holy Ghoſt: for, that's one article of faith, none of which (ſay they) can be believed without the infallible teſtimony of their Church. Wee'l leave the Jeſuites to diſtinguiſh themſelves out of this contradiction, if they can, and i'th' mean while let us examine their proofs.</p>
               <p>They offer us Tradition for proof; but for them to go about to prove the Churche's infallibity from the tradition of the Church, is to beg the queſtion. Let them firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us that the Church is infallible as it gives the traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then wee'l ſpare them any further pains to prove that it is infallible.</p>
               <p>They often attempt to prove it to us by Scripture; by which very practiſe they do but condemn themſelves: For,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48643:15"/>
Firſt, then it ſeems the Scriptures infallibility may be firſt known, before and without the believing of the Churches infallibility, <hi>quod minimè vellent</hi>: for, then the latter may be ſpared. And ſecondly, hereby once for all they appeal to mens private judgements, and that in a point on which their whole cauſe turns: and if they think the Scriptures ſo cleare for the Churche's infallibility that a private Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an may diſcern it, I do appeal to themſelves, whether many other articles be not laid down more clearly in Scripture: we ſay all. Well, but it may be ſome will ſay the Churches infallibility is firſt known, before we know the Scriptures to be infallible. I ſay then, 1. let them prove it. 2. why do they go about to prove it by Scripture? 3. let them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the above-named contradiction.</p>
               <p>Or if they'l be willing to draw ſtakes with us, and have neither the infallibility of the one, nor of the other to be firſt believed: Then firſt, let them never more quote Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for the Churche's infallibility. Secondly, let them not require us to prove the Scriptures by the teſtimony of the Church. Thirdly, they muſt give us leave to fetch all the articles of our faith immediately from the Scriptures without the midwifry of their Porphyry-chair: and then wee'l caſily grant them (if it will do tnem any good) that there is no <hi>prius</hi> and <hi>poſterius</hi> in the belief of the infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the Scriptures and of the Church, becauſe there is no <hi>poſterius,</hi> that of the Church being none at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">5. <hi>Teachers.</hi>
                  </note> nor are the words and doctrine of our teachers and miniſters to be looked upon as an infallible rule of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine faith. A private Chriſtian ought to be very obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of his Paſtour, (the Scripture every-where calls for it) he is to reverence him as his ſpirituall Father, to obey him as his governour, to follow him as his guide, yet no farther then he ha's the Scripture for his warrant; <hi>Be ye fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers

The words of a godly and able paſtour are of great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as of one that for his <hi>fidelity</hi> would not willingly for a world lead ſouls into errour; and for his <hi>ability</hi> hath a greater meaſure of the ſpirit of diſcerning, joyned with the advantages of acuteneſſe of parts, much ſtudy and reading, and long experience, &amp; therefore muſt he be heard with reverence, &amp; not raſhly dísbelieved, nor his doctrine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, unleſſe upon examination we find it to be condemned by the Scriptures. Among humane authorities, ſuch an ones teſtimony is of very great weight: but a divine faith will digge till it come to the rock of infallibility, before it build; which is not to be found ſave in that holy breath of the unchangeable Spirit, which is the Scriptures.</p>

                  </gap>, this is that balance of the ſanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, wherein faith weighs and tries all mens doctrines before it entertain them.</p>
               <p>That this was infallibly inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt is granted on all ſides, and that it may be known to be ſuch may ſufficiently appeare by what hath been already ſaid. That it is and ought to be the rule of faith, might be fully and at large demonſtrated; but ſince it hath already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured all the other pretended rules, as <hi>Aaron's</hi> rod did thoſe of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Sorcerers, and becauſe I would not be prevented in that which lies before me, I ſhall content my ſelf briefly to have pointed at an argument or two, and ſo paſſe on to what remains.</p>
               <p>But firſt give me leave to premiſe onely thus much, that whereas ſome of our Divines make Scripture the judge, others the rule of controverſies, I conceive by a little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing both may be admitted, and that the Scripture
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48643:16"/>
is both <hi>Judge,</hi> and <hi>Sentence, the Law, Rule</hi> and <hi>Principle</hi> of faith. The holy Ghoſt in Scripture is the <hi>Judge.</hi> Every truth expreſt in Scripture is a definitive <hi>Sentence</hi> when ever it ſe;lf is called in queſtion, and in reſpect of truths deduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from it it is a <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Principle</hi>; in reſpect both of truths formally contained in it, and rightly deducible from it, it <hi>is,</hi> and may be truly called <hi>a Rule</hi> or canon of faith and life; a rule to try and examine doctrines by; and this I ſhall prove briefly in three words thus.</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>Bereans</hi> are commended by the holy Ghoſt for making the Scripture the rule and trying doctrines by it, and that ſuch doctrines as were delivered by the immediate aſſiſtence of the holy Spirit, as was ſaid before.</p>
               <p>2. The Scripture is the rule according to which men ought to preach, and therefore alſo ought their doctrine to be examined by it. <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony, if they ſpeak not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-light in them, Iſaiah</hi> 8. 20. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 3. <hi>Theſe things teach and exhort, and if any man teach otherwiſe,</hi> [or any other thing <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] <hi>and conſent not to wholeſome words, even the words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to the doctrine which is according to godlineſſe, he is proud knowing nothing,</hi> &amp;c. [See alſo <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. v. 1, 2, 3.] and in the 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>Let us propheſie according to the analogy or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of faith,</hi> by which is uſually underſtood the doctrine contained in the Scriptures. But that is a remarkable place <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8, 9. <hi>if we or an angel from heaven, if any man preach any other Goſpel than what ye have received, let him be accurſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The Scripture is the rule by which we muſt be judged at the laſt day, therefore ought it to be the rule of our faith and life here. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>God ſhall judge the ſecrets of men according to my goſpel</hi>: and this we may be ſure of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48643:16"/>
that that muſt needs be ſuitable to <hi>God's</hi> will accepting and approving, which is agreable and according to the ſame will commanding and preſcribing faith and duty to us, which is revealed in his word. But this truth having been ſo much inſiſted upon by our writers, and being ſo well known as it is, I forbear further inlargement on it at the preſent. The <hi>Scripture</hi> then is the onely rule of faith: And though ſome would admit of ſomething elſe for a ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rule, for my part I ſee not how that can be admitted: for, if that ſame ſuppoſed ſecondary rule do exactly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with the Scripture, then is it not another, and ſo not a ſecondary rule: but if it ſwerve never ſo little from it, then is it falſe and erroneous, and not fit to be a rule at all: but take it at the beſt it is but <hi>regula regulanda,</hi> a rule that muſt be tried it ſelf; and who will chooſe to meaſure with a Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters rule when he hath the ſtandard by him?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scripture</hi> is the rule and the ſtandard by which all doctrines may and muſt be tried, by arraigning them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the tribunall of the Spirit in the Scriptures: but it will not be amiſſe to draw forth of Scripture a character or two to judge of doctrines by.</p>

                  </gap>, toſt up and down by the wave of every doubt, and ſo become the ſport and ſcorn of every wind and wave. And I could heartily wiſh that ſome of late had not ſailed ſo farre upon new diſcoveries, till they have loſt their compaſſe, and ſo made ſhipwrack of faith and conſcience both together. But if we deſire to be ſucceſſefull in our enterprize of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and proving doctrirnes, we muſt be ſure to hold faſt all tried and approved principles: and</p>
               <p>1. Such as are unqueſtionable or out of queſtion; we muſt not go to call them into queſtion; this were for us to be alwayes laying the foundation, ſo ſhould we never build; to be alwayes learning, but never coming to the knowledge of the truth, weak and unſtable ſouls. When truths are once tried and approved, we muſt then ſtudy arguments for them, anſwer difficulties brought againſt them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend earneſtly for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints.</p>
               <p>2. We may examine an article of faith without doubr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the truth of it. But ſuppoſe it ſhould be called into queſtion by others, yea, and doubted of alſo by our ſelves,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48643:19"/>
yet muſt we not preſently for every doubt let go our faith, nor quit it for every argument that's brought againſt it, though we cannot anſwer it. A man may have ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations for a truth, yet not be able to vindicate it from all objections, whence ſcruples will ariſe; but they may and muſt be overcome by believing and attending to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations and evidence for the truth, though we be not able to acquit our ſelves of thoſe difficulties, which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's ſophiſtry, and our own infidelity may ſuggeſt. We muſt not diſclaim a truth becauſe it is by ſome called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; much leſſe ingenuouſly do they deal by truth, who therefore diſclaim it, that ſo they may call it into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion themſelves. We may not disbelieve a truth and ſcrape it out of our ſouls, that ſo the ſoul may become <hi>raſa tabula,</hi> unbiaſſed and perfectly indifferent either to receive a truth, or to reject it; as our new methodiſts would have us do. <hi>That there is a God</hi> is an article of faith, and a firſt notion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graved upon the heart of man by nature. Should I now go and not onely forbeare my aſſent unto it, but alſo ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the contrary to counter-poiſe the ſoul's naturall <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, to try if I can write it better? What were this elſe but to lay faith to ſtake, and throw the die for it; to part with principles that we may try concluſions; to deny the truth that we may recover it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by ſyllogiſmes; to caſt a jewell into the ſea, to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we can dive and fetch it up again; with the Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank to wound for experiment; and become Atheiſts that we may convert our ſelves by reaſon; to tempt <hi>God</hi> to leave us, and to tempt the devil to deſtroy us. For my part, I profeſſe, I ſee not how this can be put in practiſe withot being guilty of ſinne and blaſphemy. Let us therefore hold faſt the truth by a ſtedfaſt faith, while we are examining do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and by holineſſe of life alſo: for the devil's great

                  <note place="margin">

                  </note> we might alſo look upon theſe later words as the <hi>end</hi> of the foregoing duty: let this be your aim and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne in proving all things, to wit, that you may <hi>hold faſt</hi> that which is good. Have recourſe unto the Scriptures that you may know what is good, have recourſe unto Scriptures that you may believe it: for, <hi>haec ſcripta ſunt ut credatis,</hi> the enſuring of our faith was the end of the writing of the Scriptures. This then condemns Scepticiſme, and the <hi>Academicks</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Again, prove all things that you may <hi>practiſe</hi> that which is good, not that you may enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain your ſelves with jejune and idle ſpeculations; the end and fruit and perfection of knowledge is practiſe: know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is a precious talent, which is given unto us not to be hidden in a napkin, but that we ſhould <gap reason="foreign">

When the Aſſay-maſter ha's once tried a piece of gold, and it endures the teſt, he pronounces it to be good, and ſo it paſſes for current.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it muſt be firmly <hi>aſſented to</hi> may appeare:</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe ſuch an aſſent is <hi>due unto truth</hi> it ſelf. Truth is the proper object of the underſtanding; and if the truth be preſented with ſufficient evidence, either of its own light, or of divine teſtimony, ſome queſtion whether the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding can ſuſpend its aſſent; I am ſure it ought not: if it do, the will is too blame, and muſt anſwer for it. And then this aſſent muſt be conſtant; <hi>buy the truth,</hi> but <hi>ſell it not,</hi> for, it is above price, and if it be ſold it muſt needs be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued.</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe ſuch an aſſent is <hi>neceſſary for us,</hi> that the truth may do us good; we are ſaved by truth, but it is through the knowledge of it. The truth ſhall make us free, but then we muſt ſuffer it to unty us, which it cannot do unleſſe it be entertained by us. The potion, be it never ſo ſoveraign, cannot cure us unleſſe we drink and take it in. Our Saviour prayes, <hi>keep them through thy truth</hi>; but if we would have truth keep us, then we muſt be ſure to keep it; it is like a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe. What a loſſe then muſt the <hi>Sceptick</hi> needs be at, who aſſents to nothing? how unſatisfied is his mind? how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided is his ſoul? what a trembling, wavering, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48643:23"/>
thing is he? S. <hi>James</hi> tells us that <hi>a double-minded man is unſtable in all his wayes,</hi> (1.8.) and if a doubting man be <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, then ſurely a Sceptick is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, of a thouſand ſeverall minds, or rather <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, having no ſoul or mind at all, chooſing to looſe his ſoul rather than be at the charge of entertaining truth, or maintaining an opinion: like <hi>Socrates,</hi> he goes to the market to buy nothing, thinking that he hath no need of any thing. In his ſoul he is quodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beticall, in his life he is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as S. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable,</hi> and indeed diſorderly <hi>in all his wayes</hi>: as the word may be interpreted; the divers luſts after which he is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and goes a whoring, will not ſuffer him to wed and plight his faith to any truth.</p>
            <p>In little better condition is the <hi>fickle</hi> and unconſtant man, who is continually fluttering up and down from one opinion to another, never ſettling nor abiding by any. He entertains truth by the day; he takes it in but it ſtayes not with him, being diſtempered with a kind of intellectual <hi>diabetes.</hi> Truth can never nouriſh ſuch a man, nor will he ever be rooted and grounded in it, who is alwayes flitting and removing. But we muſt have the truth dwelling in us, we muſt aſſent unto it firmly, that is the firſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As we muſt firmly aſſent unto the truth, ſo muſt we do it by an aſſent of <hi>faith.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Hold faſt the form of ſound words in faith,</hi> and hence it is that doctrine is called <hi>faith</hi> in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>fides quae creditur.</hi> Many truths there be, which a man may have a natural knowledge of, he may ſee the truth in all its avenues and principles, as alſo in the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary iſſues and conſequences of it, and from them be able to make it out to the rational apprehenſions of other men: But beſides this knowledge, there is another kind of aſſent found in all believers, <hi>quà tales,</hi> given to a truth onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48643:24"/>
to the divine teſtimony: this is faith; which though it be much helped by that other aſſent, when in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with it, yet it is often found without it; and this is that aſſent upon which <hi>God</hi> will have our ſalvation to depend: and this muſt we therefore yield unto truth.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe this is <hi>God's way</hi> wherein he will ſave ſouls, by Faith, not by Philoſophy, although it may be man would have liked that way beſt; <hi>but it pleaſed God through the fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of preaching, to ſave them that believe,</hi> that the glory of the power might be of God. S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. that <hi>God hath from the beginning, choſen you to Salvation through Sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth</hi>: and on the other ſide our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells us plainly and without a parable, <hi>he that believes not ſhall be damned, Mark</hi> 16. 16.</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe this way of faith makes moſt for <hi>a chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's ſecurity</hi> againſt falling away. Faith takes the ſureſt and faſteſt hold of truth. <hi>By faith ye ſtand,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. but <hi>if ye will not believe, ſurely ye ſhall not be eſtabliſhed, Iſai.</hi> 7.9. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Faith and firmneſſe are very neare of kind in the originall; the word for faith grows upon a root that ſignifies <hi>to nouriſh,</hi> no danger then of withering or fading away; the juſt by faith ſhall live, ſhall indure, ſhall perſevere, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 38. And it ſignifies to be firm alſo. Hence <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>I anſwer briefly.</p>
            <p>1. It is in its own nature a depending grace, and doth chain the ſoul to God, who is <hi>Adon</hi> an immoveable <hi>baſis,</hi> even truth it ſelf. Its root is faſtened in God, and from him it draws and ſucks continuall ſupply of ſtrength and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48643:24"/>
yea further, it doth link the ſoul to <hi>God's</hi> truth by a mutual claſping of hands, as it were. The ſoul layes hold on <hi>God</hi> by faith, and <hi>God</hi> holds our faith in his own <hi>almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> hand, (and none can take it thence). If faith do ſhrink and faint at any time, yet <hi>God almighty</hi> will not let go his hold, and ſo long no danger of Apoſtaſie. This mutuall complication we may ſee variouſly expreſt in Scripture. Sometimes the doctrine of faith is ſaid to be <hi>delivered</hi> unto the Saints, <hi>Jude</hi> 3. Sometimes they are ſaid to be <hi>delivered</hi> into that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 17. Sometimes we are ſaid to <hi>be</hi> in the truth, and on the other ſide, that to <hi>be</hi> in us; we to <hi>abide</hi> in that, and that to <hi>dwell</hi> in us; we to <hi>keep</hi> that, and that again to <hi>keep</hi> us. Our faith and <hi>God's</hi> truth are as it were mutuall hoſtages and pawns between God and the believing ſoul. <hi>God</hi> he <hi>engages</hi> his truth to the ſoul, and the ſoul truſts <hi>God</hi> with its faith. <hi>God depoſites</hi> his truth in the ſoul, and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain places its faith in <hi>God,</hi> and commits it ſelf alſo into his hand by believing, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 19. <hi>God</hi> truſts <hi>Paul</hi> with his Goſpel counting him faithfull, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. as an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. as a ſteward, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. and <hi>Paul</hi> again truſts <hi>God</hi> with his ſoul: for, he knew whom he had truſted, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 12. In which verſe alſo we reade of <hi>Paul's</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which was in <hi>God's</hi> keeping, and in the next verſe but one we heare of another <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> committed to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies</hi> truſt and keeping; <hi>If we keep God's truth, he will keep our ſouls. Chriſt</hi> hath praied, and God hath promiſed that our faith ſhould not fail, but he never did ſo much for our rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal knowledge. There is faith's firſt advantage.</p>
            <p>2. The ſecond advantage which faith hath above other knowledge in holding faſt the truth againſt temptation and perſecution, is this: That in believing the ſoul reſts it ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the veracity and infallibility of <hi>God</hi>: whereas in other knowledge it relies upon the goodnes of its own eye-ſight,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48643:25"/>
in obſerving the principles &amp; conſequents, the pedigree and off-ſpring of truth, wherein it is very ſubject to be miſtaken, and is oftimes impoſed upon. The Devil will ſooner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade a man's reaſon that the world was not created, by raiſing difficulties and puzzling his arguments; than he can perſwade a believers faith that <hi>God</hi> is fallible, who ſayes it was created. The Devil wants no ſophiſtry; the more we have to do with ſyllogiſme and deduction, the more room will he find to get in his nails. Again faith overcomes the flatteries and frowns of the world by ſeeing through them; it believes <hi>God</hi> and dare not offend him: knows what heaven is, and will not be cheated of it, as a child for a butterſlie: it knows what hell is and fears <hi>God</hi> rather than men, who is able to deſtroy both body and ſoul in hell. Thus doth faith overcome the world by believing the promiſes and threatnings of <hi>God,</hi> and thus hath faith a preeminence over all our natural knowledge as to cloſing with and keeping poſſeſſion of the truth. Knowledge, that holds, it may be, till a better Oratour, or a more ſubtile diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putant come; but when we ſhall be beaten from theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, faith will be acitadel that will hold out againſt all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: for by it the heart is fixed truſting in <hi>God,</hi> and the gates of hell ſhall never prevail againſt it.</p>
            <p>Thus have you the firſt way of holding faſt that which is good: <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>believing it ſtedfaſly.</hi> I ſhall be briefer in thoſe that follow.</p>

               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Loving.</hi>
               </note> We muſt hold faſt that which is good <hi>by loving it unfeignedly.</hi> We have truth here preſented to us under the notion of good, and ſurely then we cannot but love it; goodneſſe being love's load-ſtone, and the proper object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which it is converſant.</p>
            <p>When once, the ſoul having entertained truth doth taſt and reliſh it, delight and take pleaſure in it, then doth it
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48643:25"/>
cleave unto it, as <hi>David's</hi> ſoul did to <hi>Jonathan's.</hi> Love is an uniting affection, twining it ſelf about the thing beloved, and if it be in an intenſe degree, the thing may poſſibly by violence be torn from its embraces, but it will firſt raiſe all its <hi>poſſe</hi> to prevent it. And therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> bids <hi>Timothy</hi> to <hi>hold faſt the form of ſound words,</hi> as in faith, ſo <hi>in love,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. and by this we are ſaid to cleave unto that which is good. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 9. <hi>Let love be without diſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, abhorre that which is evil, and cleave to that which is good.</hi>

               <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 15. <hi>Follow the truth in love,</hi> not out of fanſie, as children do. That Chriſt may dwell in our hearts by faith, we muſt be <hi>rooted and grounded in love, Epheſ.</hi> 3. 17. and therefore where the love of truth once decayes, there truth it ſelf ſtaies not long after it. We reade of ſome, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 28. who <hi>not liking to retain God in their knowledge, he gave them over to a reprobate mind.</hi> And it a remarkable place that of, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 10, 11, 12. where it is ſaid that the man of ſinne ſhould come <hi>after the working of Satan, with all power and ſignes and lying wonders, and with all deceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of unrighteouſneſſe in them that periſh.</hi> See what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of thoſe who are deceived by the man of ſinne, they periſh, and if ye ask why ſo, the words following will give you an anſwer, <hi>Becauſe they received not the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved.</hi> See there how neceſſary the love of truth is to ſalvation. For, indeed where there is no ſineere love of the truth, there can be no true belief of it. For as the Apoſtle there goes on, <hi>For this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions that they ſhould believe a lie, that they all

might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſſe.</hi> Obſerve the oppoſition. A ſad place it is, and I wiſh it were well conſidered by all that are ſo cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected to the truth; eſpecially by ſuch as hate it, and are ſo much inclined in their minds and affections to the errours of that man of ſinne, <hi>whom the Lord ſhall conſume with the ſpirit of his mouth, and will deſtroy with the brightneſſe of his coming,</hi> as he there threatens. In the 10 verſe 'tis, <hi>they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not the love of the truth</hi>: and by the 12 verſe 'tis come to <hi>they believed not the truth</hi>: they had loſt the truth for want of love to it.

to be taken up with theſe duties. As <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy: The miniſter</hi> is appointed for a remembrancer to us: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.6. <hi>If thou put the brethren in remembrance of theſe things, then ſhalt thou be a good miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt</hi>: and when S.<hi>Paul</hi> himſelf went over again the cities where he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly preached the word, the text tells us what the ſucceſe was, <hi>And ſo were the Churches eſt abliſhed in the faith, Acts</hi> 16. 5. And S. <hi>Peter</hi> thought it meet as long as he continued in his earthy tabernacle, to put Chriſtians in remembrance of the truths delivered, that ſo they might have them alwayes in remembrance after his deceaſe: and that although they knew them already: 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>Wherefore I will not be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent to put you alwaies in remembrance of theſe things, though you know them, and be eſtabliſhed in the preſent truth.</hi> Though they were already eſtabliſhed, and therefore might ſeem not to need putting in remembrance, (which is the means of eſtabliſhment) yet the Apoſtle thought it meet to do it <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,</hi> even as long as he lived; for, it would further confirm them, and be a means to keep them from falling from their ſtedfaſtneſſe, and to perſevere in holding faſt that which is good.</p>

               <hi>Fourthly,</hi>

               </note> another way of holding faſt that which is good is <hi>by practiſing it conſcientiouſly.</hi> To keep the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is to obey them. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> tells his diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 15.10. <hi>if ye keep my commandments, ye ſhall abide in my love</hi>: as many branches as bring forth fruit abide in the vine, and are faſtened in it by the ſap they draw. S. <hi>John</hi> 1. cpiſt.3.c. laſt verſe, <hi>He that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him, and hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> 2. cpiſt. 1. chap. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts to give all diligence to adde unto faith vertue, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, godlineſſe, charity, and the reſt of the graces there reckoned up; <hi>for, if theſe things be in you and abound, they will

            <p>Oft times cuſtome engages men to continue in evil pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, while they are aſhamed of their principles; but when good practiſes are backt with good principles, the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the ſtronger to continue in them and defend them. An honeſt and good heart having heard the word, keeps it, and brings forth fruit with patience. A good heart is the fitteſt cabbinet to keep the good word of <hi>God</hi> in. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, when once the word is ingraffed upon the ſoul by faith, it over-rules the ſap of the ſtock, and ſanctifies the fruit.

               </note> a fifth way that we muſt hold faſt that which is good, is <hi>by proſeſsing of it conſtantly.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> was not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to preach the Goſpel, no more muſt we be aſhamed to profeſſe it: if we be, <hi>Chriſt</hi> will be aſhamed of us another day. <hi>Mark.</hi> 8. 38. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall be aſhamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and ſinfull generation, of him alſo ſhall the Sonne of man be aſhamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father, with the holy angels.</hi> And <hi>whoſoever ſhall deny him before men, him will he alſo deny before his Father which is in heaven, Matth..</hi> 10.33. <hi>Chriſt</hi> will have his truth own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his followers.

By conſtant profeſſion of, and bearing witneſſe to the truth, the <hi>truth</hi> it ſelf is <hi>propagated,</hi> and <hi>God's glory</hi> is <hi>advanced,</hi> and other <hi>Profeſſours</hi> of truth are much <hi>encouraged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when was there ever greater need of bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the truth, than at this day? when errour does on every ſide ſo much abound.

            <p>Now though it be the duty of every Chriſtian to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for truth, and that earneſtly; yet every one in his own rank and order: for, <hi>a man is not crowned except he ſtrive law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</hi> Private Chriſtians they muſt ſtrive by earneſt prayer to <hi>God,</hi> that his truth may have a free paſſage, and be victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, while others, whom <hi>God</hi> hath given commiſſion and abilities, muſt alſo contend for it by preaching, diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and writing in defence of it; all by ſuffering for it, yea, and dying in witneſſe to it, if God in his providence ſhould call them forth to it. Beloved, ye have not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted unto bloud, but ye know not what times may come; the clouds gather apace, and ſome begin to fear a ſtorm: it concerns us in wiſdome however to provide for the worſt; to be well-ſettled in the faith, to buckle on our harneſſe, and to fortifie our ſelves in holy reſolutions: to ſtand to our arms having our loyns girt about with truth; and we had need have truth girt cloſe about us, elſe we may chance to have a lap of it cut off, and we never the wiſer, as <hi>Saul's</hi> skirt was by <hi>David,</hi> while he ſlept and perceived it not.

layes it heavily to the charge of the Church in <hi>Pergamos,</hi> that ſhe ſuffered thoſe that taught it. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 14, 15. <hi>Thou haſt there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate: Repent, or I will come quickly and fight againſt them with the ſword of my mouth.</hi> The Church it ſelf was for the genetall, and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours of it orthodox, holding faſt the faith, and that in the midſt of perſecution, (as <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf bears her witneſſe) yet becauſe there were ſome ſuch hereticks in it, whom it had not ſuppreſt, therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> threatens her as you have heard: and 'tis obſervable, how he ſtyles himſelf when he begins to ſpeak to that Church, <hi>Theſe things ſaith he which hath the ſharp ſword with two-edges, verſ.</hi> 12. O, my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, when I reade this I cannot but think, ſhould now the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> from heaven thus endite <hi>England</hi>; Thou haſt there in the midſt of thee thoſe that maintain the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> of the <hi>socinians,</hi> of the <hi>Arminians</hi> (which things I hate): yea, thou ſuffereſt thoſe that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly oppoſe my truth, revile my faithfull Miniſters, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme my word, yea, even deny my very Godhead. Should <hi>Chriſt,</hi> I ſay, plead thus againſt us, I beſecch you ſadly to conſider it, what could we be able to anſwer for our ſelves? Beloved, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> be <hi>God,</hi> let us follow him, and let us follow him throughly, with a perfect heart. Let us not with <hi>Gallio</hi> think our ſelves unconcerned, and ſo ſtand by and look on, while truth and errour fight it out. Say not, <hi>God</hi> ſtands not in need of our help; no more did he need the help of <hi>Meroz,</hi> (how <hi>mighty</hi> ſoever the enemies were) but if he pleaſe to make uſe or means, <hi>Meroz</hi> muſt afford her help, or elſe <hi>Meroz</hi> muſt be curſed. And though the Lord could have wrought the deliverance of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and reſcued them from the cruelty of curſed <hi>Haman,</hi> by an out-ſtretched and immediate arm from heaven; yet
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48643:29"/>
               <hi>Mordecay</hi> is bold to tell Queen <hi>Eſther,</hi> that if ſhe held her peace, ſhe and her fathers houſe ſhould be deſtroyed, and deliverance ſhould come ſome other way, <hi>Eſther</hi> 4. 14.</p>
            <p>Neither let any man ſay, Let truth alone, it will be ſure to prevail and be victorious. For, be it true, that not all the malice and ſubtilty of Satan, nor all the powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhall ever be able to make any one ſyllable of the truth of <hi>God</hi> prove falſe; though they ſhould <hi>coelum terrámque miſcere,</hi> heaven and earth ſhould paſſe away; but not the leaſt <hi>iota</hi> of God's truth ſhould fail, yea though they do <hi>Acheronta movere,</hi> the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it: all this we grant and avow: yet let me tell you that truth would be truth though never a man in <hi>England</hi> did acknowledge it. The truth of the Goſpel abides ſtill, though the ſeven once famous churches of <hi>Aſta</hi> be at this day en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulfed in the abyſſe of Mahumetan ſuperſtition. It is not truth in the <hi>Idea,</hi> but in the <hi>ſubject</hi> that we are to contend for; not truth in heaven, but <hi>truth upon the earth</hi> that we muſt be valiant for, <hi>Jeremy</hi> 9. 3. <hi>God</hi> doth not require of us that we ſhould make his truth to be true, but that we ſhould entertain it in our hearts, and hold it faſt: that we ſhould own it, and countenance it, and maintain it in its poſſeſſion of our ſelves and others, that ſo the truth may runne and be glorified, and <hi>God</hi> may be glorified amongſt us: leaſt for our ingratitude, and want of zeal for his truth he remove the candleſtick, and beſtow it upon ſome other Nation. Then our crown is gone, our glory is departed, our day is done. And <hi>England</hi> will be nothing elſe but a ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and denne of night-monſters <hi>Ziim</hi> and <hi>Jim</hi> and <hi>Ochim,</hi> with the reſt of that diſmall crew: and ſo much the more dark then it was before it entertained the faith of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by how much a blaze of thorns doth leave the honſe darker than it found it. When the light of the Goſpel ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48643:30"/>
moved, the Prince of darkneſſe will double his guards, and heap on irons, even chains of darkneſſe. O let it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be our care to hold faſt the truth while we have it, to contend for it earneſtly, that we be not ſpoiled and robbed of it. But that we may contend aright take theſe two rules.</p>
            <p>1. It muſt not be out of contentiouſneſſe: a miniſter is forbidden being contentious, and yet is commanded to contend, and that earneſtly for the faith. A quarelſome contentious humour will raiſe up ſtrife about words when there is no ground, or <hi>fundamentum in re.</hi> A proud man (though perhaps orthodox in his judgement) will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelf with the received form of ſound words, the uſuall language of Chriſtians in all ages, but will invent a new ſet of phraſes and uncouth expreſſions, which no man elſe can without pain (it is well if himſelf can) underſtand. He will not trade with the world but in a coin and language of his own; what a troubleſome man is this, that impoſeth upon the world a neceſſity of making new Dictionaries if they mean to converſe with him? if every man ſhould do the like, what a prety <hi>Babel</hi> ſhould we have? and all this is but that he may ſeem to be ſingular and to differ ſomething from other men. But we muſt not contend out of a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not out of a love of contention, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of ſingularity, but out of a ſincere love and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the truth, and a pure zeal for the glory of <hi>God.</hi> Neither may we make theſe pretenſions of our own private quarels, as too many are apt to do. I have read of one <hi>Matthias</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and one <hi>George</hi> a King of <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> that fought a ten years warre upon a difference in point of Religion, and then at length agreed that their two fools ſhould decide the controverſie by fifty-cuffs. By the warre they ſhewed how much they pretended to truth and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48643:30"/>
religion, and by the way of agreement how little indeed they cared for it: and I think, if <hi>Plutarch</hi> were now alive, it would be no hard matter for him to find a parallel.</p>
            <p>2. Our zeal and contention for the truth muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable unto the matter wherein it is: as fire burns hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in iron than in ſtraw: ſo muſt we contend more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly for truths of greater weight, moment, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; wherein the glory of God and the ſalvation of ſouls is more emphatically concerned. We muſt not contend for all alike, much leſſe be more earneſt for minth and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and neglect the greater things, becauſe our private ſtomach or other intereſt is bound up more in thoſe than theſe. But I have now done with the ſixth and laſt way of holding faſt that which is good, <hi>viz. contending for it earneſtly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It now remains that I ſhould cloſe up all with a word of uſe and application, and very briefly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1.</note> If then it be the duty of every Chriſtian to hold faſt that which is good, hence then are to be <hi>reproved</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ſorts of perſons, I will but point at them.</p>
            <p>1. The Sceptick, that holds nothing at all.</p>
            <p>2. Thoſe that <hi>hold faſt</hi> indeed, but it is that which is <hi>not good,</hi> that hold errours and hereſies, and of theſe they are tenacious enough, even unto obſtinacy: though brayed in a mortar they will not part with them. It is ſaid of the Phariſees and their traditions, <hi>Mark</hi> 7.4. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, they received them to hold them faſt; they took them with a reſolution not to let them go for better for worſe. Zeal is good in a good matter, but this their holding faſt is to their own miſchief, as a ſinking man holds faſt the weeds that help to drown him.</p>
            <p>3. This reproves thoſe that <hi>hold,</hi> and it is <hi>good</hi> which they hold, but they do not hold it <hi>faſt</hi>: all wavering and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48643:31"/>
perſons. But theſe alſo I have already ſpoken ſomething to in the aforegoing part of my diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 2.</note> I will therefore conclude all with a word of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation</hi>; which yet I perceive is nothing elſe than what I have been doing all this while. I will adde onely to what hath been ſaid a motive or two, and a few means or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
            <p>1.<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Motive </seg>1</label> The firſt motive let be the conſideration of our own concernment, how much it is our intereſt to hold faſt that which is good. Truth is our <hi>treaſure</hi>; and a wiſe man doth not uſe to be over eaſily perſwaded to part with that. 'Tis our <hi>poſſeſſion</hi>; a man will ſue hard before he will ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be ejected out of his inheritance. 'Tis our <hi>evidence</hi>; our evidence for a Kingdome, and ſhall we not look care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to it? It is our <hi>fortreſſe</hi>; while we keep that, that will preſerve us; like <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> his maſt, tie our ſelves faſt to it, and we ſhall be ſafe; yea 'tis our <hi>life,</hi> as Solomon of wiſdome, <hi>keep her; for, ſhe is thy life</hi>: our eternal ſalvation depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our holding of it. If we give over believing, <hi>he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves not ſhall be damned</hi>: If we grow weary of well-doing, <hi>without holineſſe no man ſhall ſee God</hi>: If any love not Chriſt and his truth, <hi>let him be anathema</hi>: If any man deny them before men, <hi>him will Chriſt deny before his Father which is in heaven.</hi> It is abundantly then our manifold <hi>intereſt</hi> to hold faſt that which is good.</p>
            <p>2.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Hold truth faſt conſidering the danger we are in of looſing it, in reſpect of <hi>deceivers,</hi> who would cheat us of it, and juggle it from us; in reſpect of open <hi>enemies</hi> that would by force wreſt it from us: The Devil goes about like a roaring lion ſeeking whom he may devoure.</p>
            <p>And as at all times we had need to hold faſt the truth, ſo eſpecially in times of ſeduction and apoſtaſie, in times of temptation, and in time of perſecution; we had need to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48643:31"/>
double our guards, when the Enemy is at hand. But of this before.</p>
            <p>3.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Let us conſider how the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſtands affected towards his truth and ſuch as adhere unto it. We may ſee both in his ſpeech to the Church in <hi>Pergamos, Rev.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Thou holdeſt faſt my name, and haſt not denied my faith, Even in thoſe dayes when Antipas was my faithfull martyr, who was ſlain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</hi> Obſerve how he doth aggrandiſe and ampliſie their faithfulneſſe to him and his truth, from the conſideration of time and place; they adhered to him in times of perſecution, and in a moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous place; <hi>where Satan dwelleth.</hi> He that was wont to go about like a roaring lion, and to go to and fro up and down the earth, had now it ſeems taken up in <hi>Pergamos,</hi> reſolving to make that the <hi>ſeat</hi> of his tyranny, where he would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play the bloudy enſignes of his rage and cruelty; and yet in this very place, there were not wanting thoſe, who under his noſe, and to his very teeth did profeſſe themſelves the ſworn ſervants of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and truth, and <hi>his</hi> utter enemies. What an honour was this to <hi>chriſt,</hi> who maintained him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Church in Satans own Imperial city; and how kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth he take it from thoſe, who at ſuch a <hi>time</hi> and in ſuch a <hi>place</hi> did ſtick ſo cloſe unto him and to his truth? Which he calls <hi>my faith,</hi> and <hi>my name</hi>; he can as ſoon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get his own name and neglect his own glory, as his truth. But then, how feelingly, how pathetically doth he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and (even by name) make mention of <hi>Antipas! In thoſe dayes when Antipas was my faithfull martyr, &amp;c. In thoſe dayes,</hi> he keeps an exact account of the time, and makes <hi>Antipas</hi> his death the <hi>Epocha</hi> to compute other things by; <hi>when Antipas,</hi> he had kept <hi>Chriſt's</hi> name and you ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> keeps his: he had born witneſſe and ſet his ſeal unto <hi>Chriſt's</hi> truth, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> wears him as a
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48643:32"/>
ſignet upon his right hand, and engraves him upon the palms of his hands; he is neare and deare unto him, Chriſt knows him and calls him by name, <hi>Antipas my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full martyr.</hi> O what a pang of affection was there! Sirs, I am not able to conceive it, much leſſe expreſſe it; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you aſſiſt me with your thoughts, and ſupply by your meditations what my expreſſion cannot reach, <hi>Antipas my faithfull martyr.</hi> Pretious in the ſight of the Lord is the death of <hi>all</hi> his Saints, and bleſſed are they that die <hi>in</hi> the Lord; but much, much more pretious is their death, and thrice happy are all they whom the Lord calls forth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables to die <hi>for</hi> his ſake, and to lay down their lives in wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe-bearing to his truth. I wonder no longer that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians were ſo ambitious of martyrdome; who would not be martyr many times over, to have ſuch a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall, ſuch an affectionate commemoration from his bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi>? which will afterwards be ſeconded with an <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Direction</hi>
               </note> now a few directions, which I will but name, leaving them to be enlarged by your own private meditations.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. That thou maiſt be ſure to hold faſt, take thy hold on that rock of diamonds, the holy Scriptures; for ſand will crumble and waſh away.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Make ſure of heaven, and then ſufferings will be light. <hi>Facile eſt quidvis ſuadere perſuaſis mori.</hi> Let me ſay <hi>paratis mori.</hi> They will not fear ſhipwrack, who have ſent their ſouls before, and enſured them in heaven: that man need not fear death, whoſe life is hid with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Turn all traitours out of thy heart, which elſe will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray both truth and thee. Such are luſts, hypocriſie, by-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48643:32"/>
curioſitie, careleſneſſe. Get thy ſelf cured of thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural levity and ſlipperineſſe, it is good that the heart be eſtabliſhed with grace.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. Hold not too faſt your own prejudicate opinions, if you mean to hold truth faſt, or indeed to entertain it. For, then <hi>non perſuaſeris etiamſi perſuaſeris.</hi> They do but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be ſuitours unto truth, who are before wedded to their own opinions.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. Fifthly and laſtly, graſp not the world too hard; for, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, and is ſeldome a friend to, ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competible with that which is good. Catch not at honour, applauſe, profit or intereſt in your holding of truth; theſe will winnow from truth ſometime or other, and then the dog will hunt no longer in the roade when the hare hath left it, but <hi>Demas</hi> will take his leave of truth, and embrace the preſent world. I will end all in thoſe words of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. and the later end. <hi>Therefore brethren ſtand faſt, and hold the</hi> faith, <hi>which ye have been taught,</hi> which ye have believed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, and God even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlaſting conſolation and good hope through grace, Comfort your hearts, and ſtabliſh you in every good word and work.</hi>
