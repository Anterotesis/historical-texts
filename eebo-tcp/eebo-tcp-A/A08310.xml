            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

kind or other to maintaine his estate here. Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of fame began it. <hi>Adam</hi> digged the Earth, and manured it. <hi>Tubal</hi> wrought in Mettals. <hi>Noah</hi> plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Vineyard. <hi>Abraham, Lot, Moses, Dauid, Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeus, Amos,</hi> and many other godly and great men were Shepheards. <hi>Gydeon</hi> was a Thresher of Corne. <hi>Iacob</hi> and his sonnes the Patriarkes, were Herdes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. <hi>Ioseph</hi> a Purueyor of Corne in <hi>Egypt. Paul</hi> made Tents. <hi>Mathew</hi> was a Customer, or Toll-ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer. <hi>Peter, Andrew</hi> and others were Fishermen. And <hi>Saul</hi> a keeper of Asses. If these men began the way of labour in so many kinds, who may say he is free in one kind or other? And hee that in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of his greatnes of birth or wealth, will pretend a priuiledge of idlenes, or vaine and vnprofitable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises, doth discouer his forgetfulnes, or neglect of the dutie in earth, which euery man, euen the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est oweth vnto the Common-wealth, his owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and posteritie. And hee is censured euen by the mouth of God, <hi>Worse then an Infidell,</hi> that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecteth these duties. And none is excused, or exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of this <hi>Law of prouision for his familie,</hi> be hee neuer so high or meane; not that such men as are honorable by byrth, office or aduancement, should till the earth, or be Shepheards or Herdsmen. But that they should, according to their greatnes, exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute great place in the Common-wealth, whereof (after the care of Diuine things, in respect of God that gaue them their greatnes) they should haue care to performe some seruice, in respect of the King, vnder whome they enioy their greatnes: To shew loue and diligent regard, to ayd their inferiours, in respect of whome they haue the imputation of their greatnesse. To bee prouident in prouiding things necessarie for their Families, that haue an interest to partake of their greatnes. And lastly, in respect
<pb facs="tcp:13651:5"/>
of their posterities, that are to becom the more great by their greatnesse. And how can they do thus, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they looke into, and vse the meanes of the increase and preseruation of their greatnesse? And for as much as the same consisteth, for the most part, in the reuenewes of land: what greater care ought they to haue, then to maintaine and lawfully to augment the same? which decaying, their Honor and honorable reputation diminisheth. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue or augment Reuenues, there must be meanes: the meanes are wrought by Knowledge; Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge had by Experience; Experience by view, and due obseruation of the particulars, by which Reuenues doe, or may arise. Wherein are to bee considered the Quantities, and Qualities of Land, with the present Rents, and estimate values, by a reasonable improouement: which duly found, to haue a due regard to proportion yeerely distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and expendings, with the annuall Incoms, in such sort, as alwayes the present yeere may rather adde vnto the next, then the next to bee charged with the yeere past. For when the present yeere shall expend more then the Reuenues of the same may beare, the yeere following cannot but be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged: and so will it surcharge the future so long, that either he shall be forced to strike the topsayle of his improuident wasting, in time; or at length, through the furious blasts of excessiue prodigalitie, be blown vnder the water of disability, by ouerswel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the sayles of his vainglory. I speake not this in the way of attachment, but of preuention. And so I trust, all men will take it, and accept of my poore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour in this kind, considering that necessary it is, that al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should know what it is to haue reuenewes, namely, first to know them, &amp; then to vse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their own aduancement, and to the good of others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And because it is not the worke of the Honorable, &amp; of

And to that end, it is (no doubt) expedient, that Lords of tenants haue due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their owne estates, namely of the particulars of all their tenants landes, and that by a due, true, and exact view and suruey of the same, to the end the Lord be not abused, nor the tenants wronged &amp; grieued by false informations, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly grow by priuat Inteligencers, &amp; neuer by iust Surueyors. And because the office of a Surueior (duly waid) is an

office both necessary, expedient, &amp; of trust. It beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him to be first honestly and vprightly minded, and next, skilfull and iudicious in the facultie. Then can he not, but by industrie and diligence, produce an exact discouerie and performance of the worke he vndertaketh, to the true information of the Lord, whose benefite and vttermost lawfull profite he is to seeke, in a good conscience, disswading him yet from distastefull Auarice, the greatest blemish that can befall a man, seeking true reputation and renowne, by his reuenues. For too much seueritie afflicteth the hearts of poore Tenants, who (by common experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) are found to be more firmely knit in the band of true dutie, loyall affection, and readie seruice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Lords, by their Lords frugalitie, sweetened sometimes with the chearefull drops of true liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, then by the extreames of austeritie, vaine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digalitie, or compulsiue exactions. And yet not so, as Lords of Tenants should be so ouerswayed with abused lenitie, or carelesse looking into their owne, as may breed contempt in Tenants: but rather that they should keepe such an eeuen, and equall hand ouer their Tenants, as may continue mutuall loue, and in them a louing feare: And not to seeke the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of reuenues so much for vaine glories, as for vertues maintenance. Which will appeare by doing good to deseruers, by their vertuous life. A worke of true vertue, when contrarily, vaineglorie seeketh idle and vaine reputation, by vniustly atchieuing, and either prodigally consuming, or too miserably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing Reuenewes, which I must leaue to euerie mans owne fancie, wishing all to fashion their waies in this kind, to Gods glory, the Kings seruice, the good of the Common-wealth, and to other such ends, for which God hath giuen them greatest earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blessings; reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mending vnto you this simple

               <p>I know many Lords too forward, in taking aduantage of forfeitures vpon small occasions, and if manifest cause be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, they shew little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion:
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:13651:38"/>

And therefore in all forfaytures, there are diuers circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances to bee considered; as whether the Tenant did it ignorantly, negligently, or as constrained through necessity. In these cases, whatsoeuer lawe in extreme iustice alloweth, a good conscience for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth to take aduantage, though the second be worthy to suffer some smart: for neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce cannot be excused: for nature it self teacheth beasts, &amp; they in their maner of liuing, vse a kinde of prouidence.

knowledges, for from your mouths must that be taken and had, which must be recorded for the direction of your posterities as a perpetuall glasse, wherein the estates of all the particulars within this Mannor, may be at all times seene and confirmed: wherein you shall discharge your duties to God, who commaunds, and commends truth: to the King, who by the sword of his Iustice, maintaines truth: to your Landlord, who desireth only to knowe, &amp; haue his owne: to your selues, who by this meanes shall possesse your owne in peace: and to your posterities, who by this your trauaile, diligence and true infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, shall partake of your sincere and faithfull seruice, being inrowled, and recorded vnder your names, to your perpetuall commendation: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if you delude me, and abuse the Lord of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor that hath sent me, I by your sinister informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may commit error, and leaue it to your posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by record: yet shall I be free of the wrong, and you shall answere it.

For such rent, and doing such seruices, as haue beene heeretofore due, &amp; of right accustomed. Is not this a condition? for if you pay not the rent, or denie the seruice, you are at the Lords mercy to be compelled. I doe not thinke therefore that any of you, of any discretion, will aduenture the losse of his intrest, for not performing a seruice at his Lords commaund, that tendeth also to his owne benefite, and to no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice at all. The end therefore of all mine admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, to mooue you (being a thing of common right) to shewe your selues like vnto your selues, true and faithfull Tenants vnto the Lord, concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all in one minde, to doe the Lord this seruice in loue, and the Lord, no doubt, will recompence it with like fauour, although there be no recompence due, for that which dutie bindeth to be done. By this meanes you shal confirme your owne strengths, by gaining &amp; retaining the Lords kind countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: and he againe shall bee the more fortified, by your true affections towards him: for what a ioyfull thing is it, for Lord and Tenant to dwell together in vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie?

               <p>
                  <q>In this, the like consideration is to be had, as of the former: but that this kind of pasture is called in the Statute of <hi>extenta Manerii</hi> 3. <hi>E.</hi> 1. <hi>pastura forinsica,</hi> forraine herbage or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, because no part of it is proper in any sort to any peculiar tena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, no not to the Lord himselfe, as are the common fields &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon meddowes. This kind of Common or <hi>pastura forinsica</hi> is in three sorts: the one is, where a Mannor or towne-ship hauing and holding

their land in seueraltie, haue by consent ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited a certaine parcell of ground, to lie common among them, and from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning haue stinted euery man according to a proportion betweene them agreed, and that is commonly by the acre, which the pasture containeth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Another maner of such kind of common pasture is, where certain waste grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, one, two or more lie within the Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nor or town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and the <hi>Heard</hi> of the whole Towne is guided and kept by one appointed by the Tenants, and at their generall charge, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe their Cattle: in which kind of pasture, there is also a limitation or stint both of the number, and kinds of Cattle.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>A third kind of this pasture, or common feeding is, in the Lords own woods, that lie common to the Tenants: as also common Moores or heathes, that were neuer arable.</q>

                  <q>In all the former co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons of pasture, there should bee a certaine stint and allotment, both to the Lord and his Tenants: but in this latter, it seemeth that the Lord should not be limited, because all these latter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons are supposed his owne, and the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants haue no certaine parcell thereof layd to their holdings, but only bit of mouth with their Cattle. But the Tenants ought to bee stinted in all sorts of common, lest, as I sayd before, the rich deuour the poore: for the one can prouide sheepe, and other Cattle for the summer, and haue inclosed pasture for the winter, or can sell againe, when the forraine pasture is gone: but the poore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe so.</q>

                  <p>There may be so. And the reason may grow by the escheating of a Mannor, that had in this point a contrary custome to the Mannor, to which it was escheated and annexed: and so the customes of either may hold vnder one Court.</p>

                  <p>Some thinke it sufficient to come into a Mannor, and to call the tenants, and to cause them to shew their euidences, and to enter them, and so to giue the Lord a booke of the estates, end thinke they haue done a great worke. Which is as much as if a Caterer should prouide meate, and the Cook to send it to the table raw for his Lord to eate. The Caterers office doth as much towards the Lords diet, as the bare knowledge of the estates of a Mannor, doth towards the performing of an absolute Suruey. Yet is the Caterers office, a good inducement, and without this prouision the Cooke can do nothing: &amp; without the knowledge of the estates, a Surueyors trauail: is to little purpose.</p>

               <p>You doe well to cast all doubts. If the length be more then the tables will yeeld, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of indeed the most is foure score perches: Take first 80. perches out of the whole summe, and then seeking the bredth in the Table as before is shewed, you shall finde the content of that part. Then if the bredth be more then the remanent of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:13651:96"/>
the length let the bredth bee the length, and the remanent of the length, the bredth. And seeke them likewise in the Tables, and what ariseth of both the numbers, adde together: As for example: A ground is 119. perches in length, and 67. in bredth: the whole length is not in the Tables to bee found<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then I find 80. and that is the length, and 67. the bredth, which the Table sheweth to be 33-2-0-0. There remaineth of the whole length 39. which is a lesser number then the bredth: therefore I make 39. the bredth, and 67. the length, which the Table sheweth to bee 16. 1-3-1. which added to the first number 33-2-0-0. maketh in the whole 49-3-3-1.</p>

As for example. There is a peece of land containing many acres, and there are to be set out of this 1 2, 3.4. or more acres. First, the length must be considered. If the length be 77. perches: finde that in the first Collum of the Table, and right against it, you shall finde the bredth to be two perches, 1. foot, 4. inches, which maketh an acre.</p>

                  <hi>I vnderstand you: reason will obserue that, without serious instruction. But this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I see, extendeth but to the length and bredth of one acre: if a man bee occasioned to lay out more, he is as farre to seeke, as if he had no Table at all.</hi>

               <p>To speake truely, I cannot precisely tell you: for I haue seene the like, especially in <hi>Suff.

and made fat by industrie: and both of these by mouing yearely without intermission, and supply of helpe, may be so impaired, as it will yeeld little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite to the owner. The nature therefore of euery ground must be considered: for the vpland and high ground, may be also watrie, and consequently cold and moist, which kind of grounds are generally clay: for a sandy and grauelly ground lying high, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending, is seldome or neuer found moist by nature, but drie, and consequently hot. So that all vpland grounds are commonly either too cold and moist, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For as the constitution of a mans bodie, is found by the effects of <hi>fatnesse, leanenesse, heate</hi> and <hi>cold</hi>: So do the earths discouer their natures by their fruite, which nature causeth them to bring foorth in infinite kinds. The cold and watry grounds yeeld long, but foure and vnprofitable grasse, rushes, and rancke Mosse: which kind of ground must be cured, if need require, with draines, but commonly these grounds are of clay: and clay will neuer giue way, or euacuation to the water, because the ground is hard and stiffe, contrarie to the open and spungy ground, which is thin and open. And therefore the hottest chalk or lime, is best to kill the foure grasse, &amp; vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable mosse.

               <p>Negligence may easily find excuse: but this obiection is friuolous: for I know in <hi>Kent, Worcester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire, Shropshire, Glocestershire, Somerset,</hi> and <hi>Deuon,</hi> and many parts in <hi>Wales,</hi> full of this commoditie, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in their remote hedge-rowes.
