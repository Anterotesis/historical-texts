            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince the first crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one perticularly hath found ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny calamities and trauels of life, that it hath bene a perpetuall induſtrie in all to ſearch wherein rested this true and aſſured contentment, which we cal felicitie. Some referred it to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie of riches, &amp; with others it was establiſhed altogether in vertue. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of as the one, being but the poſſeſsions of fortune and therefore both vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and miſerable, brings with it his proper confuſion: So, the other aſpiring to immortalitie, hath no ſubiection to
<pb facs="tcp:2054:3"/>
frailtie or infirmitie, and therefore iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying it ſelfe by his owne nature, is worthely adiudged that felicitie which the world ſo much deſireth. What man is poſſeſſed with a ſpirite of vertue, in the ſame man is truly expreſſed the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude and action of be atitude, the one holding ſuch communitie with the other, that as vertue is the forge wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſoueraigne good is wrought, ſo, felicitie is the effect and ſtipend of the ſame, and they both no other thing then the very heauen and reſidence of God, wherein the ſoule is fourmed and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. No man feeleth a perfect taſt of felicitie, if with al he embrace not ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, no more then the ſauor of meate is pleaſant to the ſicke whoſe ſences ſuffer imperfection, infirmitie, or error: nor any ſtandeth deſtitute of beatitude,
<pb facs="tcp:2054:3"/>
whoſe mind communicates with deſires and mocio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of vertue, as to thoſe whoſe faith is vnfained and incorrupt, is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured the eſtate of eternitie and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Patrimony.

Sciences ſay they, prepare mens mindes to vertue, and all our thoughtes and mocions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made foule by our firſt corruption, are yet repurged by the qualety of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and knowledge, as the droſſe and ſcumme of mettall is mortified by the

industrie of workers to whom the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion appertayneth: Infinit are the commodities of knowledge &amp; ſcience, which ſhining in their perticularities as well in the workes of many wiſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as in their life and examples, it agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not now to recompt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Only, there are few who in ſtudie and knowledge find out notable rules to gouerne the bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>die, and excellent doctrines to qualifie the mind, with autentike counſels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, to exerciſe the reſidue of the man in the neceſſary conſideration of his mortalitie and frailenes. Science traue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to the fauour of posteritie, and is the aſſured protector of mens actes and monuments against forgetfulnes and enuie. It is the pillor of proſperitie, and infallible retrait and refuge in aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie: It faſhioneth the rudenes and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
<pb facs="tcp:2054:4"/>
of youth, and restraineth the crabbednes of age to modestie &amp; ciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. Jt inuents councels to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of our affaires, &amp; ministreth to our mindes ſtabilitie and reſolution of courage. Yea Science and knowledge are the very ſeminary or ſeedes out of which do bud all our floriſhing bloſſoms of vertue, and wherein our ſprites are made hable to iudge of highe and hard thinges, and ſo raiſed to thoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſires of well dooing, wherein all good men reapoſe their ſoueraigne contentment.</p>
            <p>Theſe happie fruites of Science and learninge raiſe Noble perſonages in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to merit and dignitie, and ſets a worke excellent wittes to record the reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their greatnes &amp; vertues, deuiding the doings of their life ſome into war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings

to auoyde harmes and miſeries, and ſome into precepts the better to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh examples and drawe to imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And as aboue all others of our time, your honour hath bene alwayes right worthely noted a diligent follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of thoſe Artes and ſtudies which beſt ſerue to the declaracion and glory of true vertue and pietie: So at the contemplation of the ſame, I am bold to bring forth (vnder the protecti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on of your Ladiſhip (this treatiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning morall diſcourſe ſorted with Philoſophie, &amp; ſome texts of Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: Not that I hold it worthy your view and iudgement, but (according to good meanning,) to vſe it as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of the deuocion and ſeruice wherein I am vowed to your Ladiſhip and your honorable houſe and parents.
<pb facs="tcp:2054:5"/>
And where, in the intentions of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in theſe dayes this is a lamentable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, that they conſider not thoſe cuſtomes &amp; good doctrines agreeing with holy vertues and commaundements of the law of God, but thinke it is a great teſtimonie of their ſingularitie and excellencie to publiſh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der fourmes of ſpeech, matter either merely vaine in it ſelfe, or at least vnfruitefull to the vſe and instructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of life. I thought good by the experience of their writings, not to be ſo curious to ſet out this worke with elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of phraſe and Retoricke, as to exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit precepts to liue well, ioyning to that ſmal eloquence of wordes I haue vſed, a diligence withall to dreſſe and inſtitute conuerſation and manners; the ſame being the direct line that leades to vertue, which (without this) is but the figure and image of that it ought to be. Wherein hauing reſpect to modeſtie, I
<pb facs="tcp:2054:6"/>
am farre here from meaning to chalenge the labours of others, and much leſſe ſeeke to obtrude vpon mine owne any dignitie or merite, but referre me and my trauels to the opinion of your Ladiſhip, whom I humbly be ſeech, as touching the order and partes of Art in the Booke, to iudge them with that propertie of fauour which is wont to conster nothing to blame: and for the textes and precepts whether morall, ciuill, or of diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, your Ladiſhip, in al the workes you ſhal read, can not find better doctrine, then in the life of your honorable Father, in whoſe maner and actions is fulfilled a more ful ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ample of vertue, then in all the rules and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes which my pen can deliuer. And as ſtones of rare and precious price expreſſe their lustre better in gold then in any other mettall, ſo, good and well qualefied diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are holden ſo much the more noble and
<pb facs="tcp:2054:6"/>
deare, by how much are worthie and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the perſons to whom they are preſented, the dignitie of the one ſupporting and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifying the nobilitie of the other. And as trees tranſplanted or remoued out of their naturall ſtocke into a better, become both more faire and goodly to behold, and yeeld a fruite more pleaſing the tast: In like ſort, a worke of learning drawne out of his proper Author and recommended to ſome noble &amp; vertuous perſonages, becomes ſo much the better receiued, and with a fruit more liked, by how much it is incorporate in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and name of an excellent patron. In which reſpect, knowing that there ſhines in your Ladiſhip a vertue of learning and iudgement, as doth the pearle in the gold, &amp; that your mind is diuinely enclined to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

what can that man haue loſt in this worlde who neuer loſt the reputation of honour? Therefore, neyther I for you, nor you to me, are bound to deſire more one for an other, then to haue health for the ſolace of our tranſitory time: to enioye a compotent meaſure of wealth for the adminiſtration of our life: and to be raiſed to honour by the which we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne reputation: For, as all other thinges are paſſed to vs by fortune, not to honour vs, but to affront vs, So, ſir, I wiſh you this moderation, to reſt contented with that which God hath beſtowed of you, and giue him often recompence of humble thankes for taking you out of ſo many daungers: for, as much do we owe to God for the daungers from which he deliuereth vs, as for the great wealth &amp; dignities where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto he hath alwayes raiſed vs.</p>

               <p>As it is ſuffred in the high and hidden ſecretes of God, to diſſemble ſome things, to pardon others, and correct the reſt: ſo let vs remember that God vſeth no ſmall mercie to hym whom he chaſtiſeth in this worlde, ſince that, to whome hée giues no affliction, it ſéemes he is of him much forgotten: Therefore when God adminiſtreth to vs diſeaſes, ſorrowes, deathes, and infelicities, they be not thinges wherewith hée chaſtiſeth vs, but neceſſarie matters by the which he viſiteth our fraile condicion: wherein his intention is not to loaſe vs, but to admoniſh vs: not to make vs ſtumble, but to holde vs from falling: not to poyſon vs, but to purge vs: not to make vs ſlide into ſinne, but to call vs to amendement of

behauiour: ſo that with this full meaſure of bountie and mercie, he giues vs not onely that which we aſke, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares vs more to that which he would we ſhould demaund of him: this giues me occaſion to ſmile that our power being little, our ſelues ſo ſmall a thing, and our knowledge ſo ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, yet we thinke and conſter to great importance all our enterpriſes, when in déede, that which in our opinion wée holde moſt profitable, takes ſometime a contrary habit, and becomes moſt hurtfull and againſt vs.</p>
               <p>By meanes whereof, the Lorde, with good reaſon vſing his wonderfull mercie, takes from vs thoſe occaſions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we may offend him, and leades vs in the exerciſe of ſuch thinges as ſtand vs in moſt ſtéede to ſerue him.</p>
               <p>God deales in one ſort with the Chriſtian ſinner, and in an other maner with the iuſt man: to the ſinner, he pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his offence, and from the iuſt, he takes away the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to ſinne: by which, we finde that we ſtand more déepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound to him which ſuffreth vs not to fal, then to him that lendes vs his hand to helpe vs vp againe. This much (ſir) to inſtruct you in patience for the loſſe of ſo good a wife, whoſe death, if you lament in the office of a good huſband, I haue not ben without my ſorow, according to the dutie of a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full friend: And albeit there is no doubt but your wife was a right worthy member of a noble houſe, and therewithall plentifully repleniſhed with euery condicion appertayninge to the vertue and modeſtie of a woman, yet ſince in her crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhe brought with hir a ſubiection to death, I thinke your wiſedome is too great, to make that grieuous to you, which nature ordeyneth common to all: yea if in your wife were fully filled a full example of all perfection,<note place="margin">That, that is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:2054:11"/>
we be, the leſſe while we liue, for that being deare to him he doth the ſooner drawe vs to his kingdome. I knowe that in your wife, God had expreſſed a ſpirit of great méeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to you, made her very acceptable to her neighbours, moſt plawſible to your parents, &amp; very pitifull to the poore, wherein by how much ſhe was agréeable to all and her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hurtfull to none, by ſo much haue you to hope that ſhée is already in the way to hir ſaluation. But ſéeing ſhe is dead, and now ſet in the place of Gods eternall appointment, and ſince in the world is no power eftſones to raiſe her, let her reſt at quiet in the ioyes of Paradiſe, and reſort you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to a reſolute patience. Become imediatly carefull for your life, and leaue of thoſe funeralles, and vayne ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies for the dead, ſéeing that if God hath fulfilled his will to call her to him, it is to place her in his tabernacle of eternall reſt, and leauing you ſtill in the world, he doth it to none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end but to giue you time of amendement: For where God promiſeth to man long and many daies, it is vnder this warning, that he giue order to the correction of his life. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times haue I ſpoken, and written, that the ſounde and noyſe of Belles, doth not ſo much benefite the dead, as do good to thoſe that liue, for that as the dead, béeing wythout ſence are alſo voyde of nature and habilitie to reſume re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, ſo to ſuch as liue the Belles giue warning of death, as thoſe that are alreadie departed, yea they pronounce that we ſhall all be buried, as ſuch as are alreadie put in the graue, and no more remembraunce remayne of vs then of them that lie couered with claye: which makes mée ſtill maintaine, that albeit to the dead the Belles are merly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, yet, to the liuing, they ſerue as officers to ſomon vs to the fatall banquet. They call vs to prepare our recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and make vs readie to appeare afore our ſoueraigne iudge to heare our ſentence: yea they put vs in remembrance of the laſt houre of our miſerable life, and then as I knowe none that wiſh to haue bene Emperours, ſo there is no

doubt but many deſire to haue liued in the ſtate of poore heardſmen: But now to perſwade with you ſomewhat fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarlie, aſwell to witneſſe my good will, as to warne your frailtie, I wiſhe you to vſe patience, not ſo much to expreſſe your grauetie, as to ſolace the heauineſſe of your minde: and by ſo much haue you néede to cal for aid to the ſpirite of God, by how much the greatnes of your loſſe ſéemes to excéede the reſiſtance of fleſh and bloud: conſider that to render retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bucion is a dutie of nature, and a debt to be payed either in youth, in age, or at other ſeaſon, and that not in the hand and diſcretion of man, but at the will and good pleaſure of God, with whom we haue no power to contend, for that the thinges which he commaundeth ought to be accompliſhed, and what he willeth, is well worthy to be approued, being impoſſible that he ſhould exact any vniuſt thing, he that is euen the ſelfe ſupreame and ſouereigne iuſtice. Be it (ſir) that you are ſory for her death, of whom can you redemaund your loſſe but of death, againſt whom there is neyther pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription nor authoritie: It is he in whom is wrought the very effect and ſtipend of ſinne, and it is he that is the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full tirant ouer the world,<note place="margin">Death the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry effect and ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend of ſinne.</note> who yéeldes no compaſſion to the teares of men, takes no care of their ſighes, ſcornes at their complaints, and playeth with their afflictions: he maketh great kinges fall as lowe as the ground: he deuides their principallities, deſtroyeth their heyres: he confoundes the proude and mightie, and rayſeth the humble and méeke: hée neither pardoneth old men, nor pitieth the young ſort: yea he hath authoritie to call all men to reckoning, and no man to demaund reaſon of him.

               <p>I doubt not but it is grieuous to you to féele the want of ſo deare a wife, aſwell for the ſolace of your perſon, as direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your houſe and children: but ſéeing the chaunces of mortall creatures do ſhew that al men are ſubiect to the law of nature and fortune,<note place="margin">All men ſubiect to the lawe of nature and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</note> and that of neceſſitie this muſt paſſe ſo: put on a good countenaunce to the world, and ſhake of all inward heauines of mind, ſéeing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> care of thinges impoſſible is vaine and only proper to weake men: you know alſo that in this troubleſome life, many mo in number are the things that amaze vs, then thoſe that hurt vs: And therfore to wéepe much, to ſigh often, to ſorrowe alwaies, to weare attire of dule, to flée ſocietie of friends, to retire into deſolate &amp; priuat places, &amp; to delite in ſolitarines, be, in one of your grauetie, matters more to be rebuked, then affected, ſéeing, that as too great ioye eſtrangeth the heart into the like, ſo, for the moſt part much parplexitie &amp; ſorrow, bring with them the effect of diſpaire: You ought not for the death of your wife, to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in the adminiſtration of your houſe, careleſſe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtate of your health, forgetfull to entertaine the reputation of your honour, nor vnmindful to direct your reuenue: For the paſſions and afflictions of the hart,<note place="margin">Paſſions of the minde cured with the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of time.</note> are neuer cured by newe grieues, but with the longneſſe of time.

haue alwayes vſed difference of cuſtomes: <hi>Licurgus</hi> the law-reader of the <hi>Lacedemoniens</hi> held ſuch in moſt honour, whoſe beardes were moſt hoarie, and heads moſt white with age: <hi>Promotheus</hi> ordeined amongſt the Egiptians, that to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of iuſtice was tranſferred moſt honour: And king <hi>Drida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> was wont to ſay to the <hi>Scicilians,</hi> that to the prieſts of the temple moſt honour was due: <hi>Bryas</hi> kyng of the <hi>Argiues</hi> gaue moſt honour to the Philoſophers that read in ſchooles: <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> amongeſt the <hi>Romanes</hi> was of opinion that he was worthy of moſt reputation, to whom had happened the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of any famous battell: But <hi>Anaxarchus</hi> the Philoſopher ordeined amongeſt the <hi>Phenitiens,</hi> that in a commonweale ſuch ſhould be moſt honored, who, in time of peace, intertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſtate in tranquillitie, and in the furie of warre, was found a wiſe and valiant protector of their limittes: In all which, albeit there was iuſt merit of honour and reputation, yet, in common experience and reaſon of thinges we can not but confeſſe more deſert of worthineſſe and vertue in ſuch, whoſe wiſedome &amp; diſcreation makes them hable to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble &amp; ſuffer: For, to be diſcréete in proſperitie, &amp; patient in aduerſitie, is the true mocion &amp; effect of a valiant &amp; vertuous mind. If you weigh theſe things with the nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of the preſent time, you wil conclude with me (I doubt not) but that the imperfection of your demaund, takes away neceſſitie in me to make anſwere: For in theſe daies what is more familiar with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt ſort, then to ſcoffe at the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and dignitie of old age: to diſobey magiſtrates, diſpiſe iuſtice, ſcorne the Clergie, laugh at the want of Captaines, perſecute the wiſe ſort, and betray ſuch as follow vertue and ſimplicitie of life: So that in an age thus hardned, and time ſo vnthankfull, that man takes vppon him no ſmall enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, who ſtriues to be vertuous, ſince vertue is a thing that prepares vs to immortalitie,<note place="margin">Vertue prepares vs to imortalitie</note> and makes vs equall with the heauens: In times paſt, he that knewe moſt, was eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med beſt: but now, who is moſt riche, is rayſed to moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:

So that the condicion of this age is, to eſtéeme men ſo much the more, by how much they wallowe in wealth, and to meaſure their reputation, not with the dignitie of their vertues, but according to the facultie and fulneſſe of their richeſſe: For worldly men are ſo infected with corruption, and their nature ſo ſubiect to reuolucion and change, that in caſes of promotion, high office and dignitie are rather bought with money, then deſerued by vertue. In times paſt, there was no man areared to honour but he that deſerue it: but now who are called but ſuch as ſearch it with money. In the former ages, men of ſcience were ſearched for in farre coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, but now though they knocke at our gates, they are not ſuffred to enter, no, our corruption &amp; cuſtomes draw vs to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delites. In that golden worlde, there was no ſenat, or counſell eſtabliſhed, where was not reſident ſome excellent Philoſopher: and now where haue we any pallace, which is not repleniſhed with ſcoffers &amp; inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ters of vanitie: ſuch was the felicitie of thoſe daies, that he that was vertuous, had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to controle the wicked, wher now, there is no more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Touching your demaund, what maner of people in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of the Gentiles were called théeues, and the ſortes of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they were put vnto: although there be great neceſſitie in your requeſt, and no leſſe inſufficiencie in me to ſatiſfie it, yet I will aunſwere you with the opinion of <hi>Aulus Gelius,</hi>

who diſcribing many orders of théeues, diſtinguiſhed aſwell their puniſhments, as ſome kindes of theftes, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the time and perſon that commits them, may often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be taken for faultes, but not eſtéemed as theftes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For in paine &amp; iudgement the qualetie with the quantetie, muſt be conſidered. The auncients held him as a théefe, who, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the field, or towne, tooke away that which was an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and made no body priuie to it, or againſt the wil of the owner: he alſo was eſtéemed as a théefe, who borowed a horſe for one dayes iorney, and retayned him longer: he alſo was accompted a théefe, who being put in truſt with the kéepinge of other mens goods, conuerted them to his proper vſe, as if they had bene his owne. Laſtly he boore the name of a theefe, which borowed any thing for ten daies, &amp; reſtored it not in twentie. And as all theſe in their ſeuerall kinds were eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med robbers and théeues, ſo the law ſet downe for them va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of puniſhment: For amongeſt the Gréekes, they were marked on the forhead with hot yrons, to the end to be more readily knowne.<note place="margin">Puniſhments for theeues.</note> The ſtatutes of <hi>Licurgus</hi> were to cut of their noſes: <hi>Promotheus</hi> ordayned that they ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to children to puniſh them at their pleaſure: by the law of <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> one of their handes was cut of. But the firſt that inuented to cut of their eares, or ſtrangle them vpon gibbets, were the Goathes, who, (notwithſtanding in other reſpects were Barbarus) yet vſed they ſeuere iuſtice to théeues and robbers: But at this day (ſir) if there were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Here alſo is to be noted, that this Théefe in his inuocation to Chriſt, dyd not deſire the LORDE to haue remembraunce of him to the ende he were not Crucifyed, nor required him to be mindefull of him that he myght eſcape the Perilles of Death, ſince it was he onely that gaue lyfe: But he ſayde onely <hi>Lorde forget me not when thou commest into thy Kyngedome:</hi> For, ſéeing thée on thy Knées afore Pilate (ſayth he) and béeing aſked whether thou were a Kynge and had Realmes, I hearde thée Aunſwere that thy Kyngedome was not of this Worlde: Which béeing true, I beſéeche thée, Oh ſwéete comfort of my Soule, that when thou art in Poſſeſſion of thy Kyngedome of reſt, thou wilt then haue remembraunce of me, being the greateſt Sinner in the Worlde. This Théefe, ſéeing GOD in preſence, hearing him ſpeake in perſon and touching him wyth his handes, and woulde not demaund of him other thinges then of the Worlde to come, can not but put men in a maze, and drawe euen Aungels to admiration.

And ſince the Lawe of nature and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune make all thinges Subiect to reuolution and chaunge, and that of our ſelues we are the proper inſtrumentes of our owne harmes, we ought not to be Angrye or vexed but agaynſt ſuch as ryſe to offende God and ſturre vs to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte Sinne: For, a good Chriſtian ought to be more ſorye for him that hath a wounde in his ſoule, then for any that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2054:52"/>
ſuffer loſſe of their Goodes, though there be neuer ſo great Neareneſſe and reſpect of Kindred and frendſhip: So that the thing that ought moſt to trouble a good Chriſtian, and bréede compaſſion in the man of holineſſe and vertue, is to ſée that men beare ſuch appetite to the ſwéeteneſſe of ſinne, and with ſuch boldeneſſe follow their libertye to doe euill, that many and many are thoſe now a dayes, who had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther breake the commaundementes of the holye law, then to infrindge the leaſt ſtatute of the Prince. This is a thing to be marueiled at, that when the Marchaunt is taken with a counterfayt meaſure, or the Goldeſmith with a faulſe weight, the meaſure ſhall be brunt, the Balaunce broken, and the offender rendred to publyke Iuſtice: But if a man ve knowne to renounce GOD, or to beare the guilt of Periurie, Murder, or Adulterye, much leſſe that he ſhall be chaſtiſed, but of the moſt he ſhall be fauoured, ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and iuſtefied, yea, to his impunitye ſhall be added ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertye to offende further to the Daungerous Example of a whole communaltye. That men Sinne, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but that they be ſuffered to heape Sinne vppon Sinne, bringes ſlaunder to the whole race and generation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde: For, to be ſo impudent as to Blaſpheme openly, and to be an Adulterer in publyke, is as though there were no Goſpell to forbyd it, nor GOD to Puniſhe it: It is ſure moſt horrible for a man to ſwell and waxe Fatte in Sinne, whoſe ſwéeteneſſe drawing him on after the delightes of this Worlde, makes him ſo ſucke and licke vp the Sirup of euery vice that if he leaue, of with any of Gods commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements vnbroken, it is not for want of will but becauſe he may no more: and albeit it be lawfull for no man to ſinne, yet how many do we ſée ſo reſolued &amp; obſtinate in wickednes that by continuall frequentation of euill, they dout whether they be euill men or not. There is nothing more dangerous to a Chriſtian then to accuſtome himſelfe to harden his Conſcience, for that in ſuche wretches there is no will to

               <p>Following then the example of ſo many holy and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent perſonages, we may accompliſhe this commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement <hi>To be angrie and ſinne not,</hi> which we doe then beſt perfourme, when we rebuke the ſinne, and beare pitie to the ſinners, and helpe to ſuccour and ſaue their ſoules, &amp; geue no meane to the loſſe and infamie of their honor: The which now a dayes happeneth in the contrary, for that in few men is fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a diſpoſition to rebuke ſinne, but al ſorts are diſpleaſed with the ſinner, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitting their zeale into Ire, and Ire into ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and ſo by little and little, vnder couller to chaſtice, moſt men execute reuenge. The ſinne of Anger, beſides, that of it ſelfe it is hatefull, is alſo in the ſame daungerous, ſéeing that with no man the neighbourhode of an angrie man is welcome, nor his frendſhip tollerable.<note place="margin">Diſcription of a furious man.</note> The angrie and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious man hath theſe diſcriptions: His eyes rolling, his face enflamed, his body trembling, his tongue troubled, his harte burning, and his handes readie to ſtrike, and ſo long as he is gouerned with rages, much leſſe that he is fitte to execute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny publike buſines, ſeing he neither knoweth what he ſayth, nor comprehendeth what he ought to doe: And the more he is rayſed to place and dignitie, the more hurtfull he is: For

that which in a priuate man is no more then naturall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,<note place="margin">That which in a priuate man is but naturall anger, in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate may be called rage and furie.</note> in a Mageſtrate: Authoritie makes it rage and furie, and therefore in the adminiſtration of a common weale, there is nothing more vnworthie, then to a hart naturally fierce and cruell, to adde power and Authoritie. To the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient and furious man moſt commonly thinges doe not beſt ſuccéede, for that béeing in Paſſion, he hath not the rule of his owne iudgement, and much leſſe is hable to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of his fortune, he ſeldome findes frendes to follow him, and hath few ſeruauntes to ſerue him: For, it goeth for the moſt part with the furious man to haue euill will of many, &amp; ſtability of felowſhip with none: And ashe is troublſome to many, ſo euerie man hath matter to ſpeake agaynſt him, whereby, by the iuſt occaſion of his owne meritte he liues alwayes in contention, in perplexities, in ſuſpition, in murmure, and for the moſt part doth conteſt and accurſe agaynſt himſelfe. Such men mooue their owne ſcorne, for that in their Paſſions they are laughed at, their frendſhips ſuſpected, and in their dealinges they are feared: that more eaſie is it to endure a temptation, then the neyghbourhode of a furious man. With ſuch men, we muſt not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in thinges diſcréete, nor truſt them in ſecrete buſineſſe: For that to geue councell they are to raſhe, and to vſe ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie their mouth is to open. It is daungerous then to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte to a man poſſeſſed with a ſpirite of Anger, any charge of gouernement in the common weale: For that, in affayrs of policie, as there be things that deſerue to be chaſtiſed, and matters that ought to be diſſembled: So, it can not but hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the furious man, that in place to appeaſe and couer iniuries, he will of himſelfe thunder reproches agaynſt the parties: But now after the daungers and domages that come by Anger, it apperteynes to reaſon and congruencie, to exhibite a fewe remedies to Cure or qualifie thoſe moodes. In all our affayres and actions, it is good to fore ſée both what may happen to vs, and what may be ſayde of vs, For,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2054:54"/>
ſo ſhall we be Armed, that albeit men geue vs cauſe to be Angrye, yet they ſhall haue no power to make our paſſion furious: And therfore the ſame néede that the poore man hath of Riches, and the Foole of Wiſedome, the ſame ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie hath the harte of patience: For, béeing Subiect to many Afflictions, and the troubles no leſſe that aſſayle him together wyth the daungers that depende on them wth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compariſon, many mo be the thinges which he ought to ſuffer in patience, then that are Lawfull for him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge wyth his Tongue. And if of euery wronge that is done to vs, and of euery aduerſitie that is naturall to our condition we ſhould reteyne ſpecial accompt and reckoning, our hands would neuer ceaſe to reuenge, our Tongue wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with complayning, and our hart waſted and broken with ſighing: For, what man béeing a member of this miſerable lyfe, to whom is not one equall deſire that his dayes and troubles might diſſolue together: Men béeing ſo ouergrowne wyth vices, and ſo deuoured wyth affayres and buſineſſes, it is maruell that ſince they are ſo ſlow to cutte of their cares and troubles, that the waues of their proper aduerſities doe not riſe and ſwallowe them vp. And if the Phiſitions ordeined to cure infirmities of the body, would binde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to heale the ſorows of the hart: they ſhould in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler haue more patients muſtering afore their gates, then in times paſt were inhabitantes in <hi>Rome</hi> when it was beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed: For, ſo naturall is the ſickeneſſe of trouble and vexation, that though many eſchew it, yet few haue power to liue long exempt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it. What is he either paſt, preſent, or to come, who, in his body hath not felt ſome paine, and in his hart ſome paſſion, hath not ſuffered ſome loſſe or ſpoile of his goodes, or infamye to his perſon, or at leaſt who can walke ſo vpryghtlye to whome is not done ſome Iniurye, or ſome Scorne or Reproache ſpoken?

that euen then ſhall he laye the plotte of the ende, and diſpatch of his life, when he begins to put order to theſe incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable harmes: For as there is no Sea without working, no Warre without daunger, nor Iourney without trauell: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo that there is no worldly lyfe voyde of troubles, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eſtate without ſtombling blockes, it is moſt apparant in this, that there liues no man ſo happie which hath not wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to be greued, and wherupon to complaine.

               <p>Out of theſe wordes, may be gathered foure things which God commaunded <hi>Abraham,</hi> and other foure things which God promiſed him: So that as a Lorde, he teacheth him in what he ought to ſerue him, and withall tels him what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde he will geue him for his ſeruice: Afore God called <hi>Abraham,</hi> it was not founde that there was any vertue in him, and much leſſe that he had done any ſeruice to God: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſcriptures make mencion that he was of the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Saruth,</hi> and ſonne af <hi>Tara,</hi>

The firſt function or eſtate, is called deuine, and conſiſtes (as is ſayd) in this, when the great goodnes of God ſo toucheth the hart of a man, that he leaueth that which he doth, and doth that which he ought, eſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his minde from worldly thinges, and rayſing it to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and heauenly contemplations. The ſeconde is called humaine or worldly, as when any wicked liuer is tourned to God by the councell of ſome good man, as <hi>Hippolito</hi> was conuerted to the Fayth by the inſtructions of <hi>S. Laurence:</hi> The thirde vocation may be called conſtrayned, or by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie: as when a man of diſſolute conuerſation, and falling into aduerſitie, is conuerted to God: And as theſe be the thrée manners of calling, and meanes to enter into Religion, ſo, if they be wel conſidered, I ſée not how the firſt (oftentimes) eyther doth much profite, nor the laſt much hinder for more
<pb facs="tcp:2054:56"/>
or leſſe to ſerue God in religion: For, there haue bene many of thoſe which God hath called to Religion, condemned, and many others which came to ſerue him by force, haue ben ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Chriſt called and chuſed to the Colleadge of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> curſed <hi>Judas,</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>S. Paule</hi> being reuerſed and falne from his Horſe, neceſſitie compelled him to know Ieſus Chriſt: So that <hi>Judas</hi> being exalted, fell, and <hi>S. Paule</hi> being falne, was exalted. This I bring in this place to the ende that none eſtéeme much, or make great accompt, either to be called to the Religion by the will of God, or to come to it by any neceſſitie or miſaduenture: For the Seruaunt of God which trauelleth towardes his ſaluation in a religious lyfe, ought not to remember ſo much how God called him, as to conſider wherefore God called him. There be many religious men in Monaſteries and elſewhere who atribute much to themſelues for that they entred religion in infancie, others chalenge more for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they tooke the habite in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heate of their youth: Some there are that aſcribe to their aduauntag for that they profeſſe an order very ſtrayt and reformed, and others for being the followers and Diſciples of men of holy lyfe: And many there be with whome it is no ſmall repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to haue continued in Religion thirty, forty, or fiftie yeares, and they, in reſpect of their preſcription, holde all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers but Nouices: Yea, moſt of them ſticke not to referre all their perfection to the long time they haue dwelt in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries, hauing no regarde to the little they haue profited in them. But, to enter Religion in infancie, in youth, or in olde age, to the man of God ought to miniſter no occaſion of aduantage or eſtimation ouer others: but rather let him (as a good ſteward) make a good accompt of his time, and trauell more in the ſtudie and ſeruice of God, then to kéepe recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the yeares of his continuance. For what eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can preſcription bring to any man, when he can ſhew no fruite of his time? ſéeing that much more doth the religious man deſerue for his knowledge and humilitie, then for his
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2054:56"/>
olde age or continuance. <hi>Judas</hi> remayned thrée yeares in the Apoſtleſhip of Chriſt, and thrée houres and no more dyd the good théefe hang by our ſauiour on the croſſe, and yet by faith we are aſſured that more did profit y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> théefe thoſe thrée hours in torments, then the thrée years did good vnto <hi>Iudas</hi> being a folower of Chriſt: In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> parable of the vineyard in the goſpel was no more hire geuen to him that wrought from morning till night, then to thoſe that entred the vineyard at the laſt houre: whereby we are inſtructed that our merit or not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſtandes not in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeruices which we doe to God, nor in the little or great charitie which we expreſſe, but chiefely as it pleaſe his goodnes to accept or reiect vs. All y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles were called by Chriſt before his death, ſauing <hi>S. Paule,</hi> &amp; yet who doubtes though he was the laſt in vocation, but that he was euen the firſt and chiefeſt in perfection (becauſe he laboured more then all the reſt): So that albeit to enter religion in infancie, in youth, or to remaine there long time, can not be but commendable, yet vnder this condition, that it be not to this ende to haue a greater portion in the profites, but to be more humble in their profeſſion. Beware therefore you that he Auncientes in houſes of Religion, that you fall not into the deceits and circumuentions of the deuill, who, in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the great nomber of yeares that you haue dwelt in religion, &amp; the many temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that you haue endured there will perhappes go about to pay you with the beſt chamber in the Dorter, &amp; make you proude with the firſt voyce in the chapter: Which you muſt eſchew, for that, how much leſſe comfort and cheriſhing you haue in the eſtate of religion, ſo much more is your perfection and reuerence. In like ſort in the good religious man ought to appeare no vain glory, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he profeſſeth the habit of a ſtrait order, or a vocation of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or whether he be obſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or cloiſterer: for, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpell conſiſtes not in the monaſterye wherein we enter, but in the good and holy lyfe we lead.

Let not the ſeruant of God alſo be glorious, for that in his order he was eſtéemed of holy lyfe: For great is his ſhame to be taught by a good May ſter, &amp; forget to follow his vertues, &amp; farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is his abuſe if he be renoumed for holineſſe, and be founde an Hypocrite. <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> had <hi>Moyſes</hi> to their mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, <hi>Achab</hi> had <hi>Helias, Ananias</hi> had <hi>S.

And as in workes made by mans hande, we haue a cuſtome firſt to prayſe the worke, and then the workeman that made it: ſo, touching a lyfe religious, it is to ſmall purpoſe for a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple to beare prayſe by his mayſter: The good Religious man ought not to vau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, if the Lord cal him more to one reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion then to an other: for, after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a man be baptized, there is no eſtate in all the Church of God wherein the good man may not be ſaued, and the wicked condemned: And therfore

controule that which they haue, and be diſcrete in that which they ſpende, they ſhould finde that the trauell they endure is not to ſatiffie the neceſſities they féele, but to accompliſhe the vanities wherein they liue: Riche men, the more they beginne to finde out the ſecret and ſuttletie of traffyke, the more doe they fall into the bottomleſſe troubles thereof, as, to buye, to ſel, to exchaunge to retayle on creditte, yea, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile, rob, &amp; deceiue, and which worſe is, when they proteſt moſt to geue it ouer, it is then they are moſt drowned in it: So that the more they haue, the more they ſéeke to get, the more they buye, the more bargaynes they make, yea, the more they deſire the more doe they rob, and yet (ſuch is their wretchednes) that that which they haue, ſeemes but little to them, &amp; the little that others haue they eſtéeme a great deale: yea, being neuer ſatiſfied, they holde that they haue but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, in compariſon of that they deſire to haue.

               <p>By all theſe, we may proue it a faulſe teſtimonie of him that calleth riches goodes, ſéeing they haue no propertie nor nature of God, but worke the effect of much euill: For, if there be any euill in the worlde at this daye, riche men doe bréede it, and the poore ſort endure it: And therefore ryches can not bee called good, for that greater is the nomber,<note place="margin">Rich men brede moſt euills in the world.</note>
without compariſon, of ſuch as being good, become euell by riches, then of ſuch as being wicked, are by riches holpen to be good.

That if riches were good as the worlde ſayth, and not euill as all men ſée, there would not be areared ſo cruell warres betwéene Princes, ſo many reuolts and troubles amongſt eſtats and countries, ſo many quarrels amongeſt neighbours, nor ſo many ſutes and proceſſes betwéene bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne: amongſt all which is ſeldome ſéene, one man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with another for the correction &amp; amendme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his life, but rather for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vſurpation of their goods &amp; poſſeſſions: wher in I ſée no reaſon to call that good which is the occaſion of ſo many euils, ſince that no other thinges are the riches of the world, but a deſire of vaine men, a ſtumbling blocke for the wicked, a limebuſhe for the good, and a perpetuall perplexite for all ſortes.</p>

Therfore he that wil be poore, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, abſtinent, &amp; continent, may with ſuretie be a member in al monaſteries, but if he delight in epicuritie, diſſolutnes,

And therefore where the LORDE ſaith, it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs to haue our gownes girt afore wée take the candels in our handes, it is to aduiſe vs that in ſuch ſorte ſhould wée leaue bound, trodden out, and naked, the vanities and ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of this world, that they haue no power to followe vs, and wée leſſe deſier too goe ſéeke them. The lighted can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delles which wée ſhould haue in our handes, be the good and holy works we ought to doe, and as he is one that holdes the candell, and he an other that pertakes in the vſe and light of it: ſo the good worke of the holy man is not onely profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to himſelfe alone, but it alſo ſerueth to edifie an other that ſéeth him do it: with all, like as he is not exempt from ſinne, who to an other giues occaſion to ſinne: in like ſorte that man can not be without meritte, whoſe vertue is the cauſe that an other doth any good action: the ſame agreeing with the interpretation of this text of the Prophet, <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps ſum omnium timentium te:</hi> when we are the cauſe that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men ſerue God wée do communicate and pertake (ſaith he) with the merit of ſuch good thinges as they do in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. It ſufficeth not (ſaith Ieſus Chriſt) to holde one onely candell in our handes, but it is requiſite to the office and pietie of Chriſtians to haue many: For, as the true chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, and man of perfect deuotion to GOD receiues of the plentifull hand of the Lorde, many graces and benefites: So it is neceſſary that he do him many ſeruices, and kéepe his ſpirit in continuall exerciſe of thankeſgiuing. For, as this is common in the office and frendſhippe of men, that by how much leſſe we are raiſed to benefites aboue our merit,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2054:62"/>
ſo much more are bounde to owe al thoſe due reſpectes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence and ciuility as may hold vs acquited, and leaue our frend ſatiſfied. Euen ſo with God, this is an infallible propertie in his iuſtice, to miniſter rewardes to good men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the rate of their merittes, and prepare puniſhment to the wicked vnder their deſeruinges. And where Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds (not without great miſterie) that we ſhould hold in our handes our candles lighted, and neither vſe the ſeruice of the candleſtick, nor appoint others to hold them for vs: it is to aduertiſe vs, that if God ought to ſaue vs, it ought to be through his great mercy onely, and not by any meane of our proper merittes, although in our actions we ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to expreſſe a holy induſtrie and diligence. In like ſort it is not enough (in the profeſſion of religion) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we be girt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dles, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we hold the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in our hands, or that we haue many candles: but it belongs to our chriſtianitie to haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> burning with light, &amp; not as dead and ſtinking ſnuffes: wher by we are warned, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better were it, not to enter into religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at al, if in the ſame we correct not the abuſes of our liues, &amp; gather profit by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruit &amp; doctrine of the goſpel: by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> example of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great prophet S.

The virgins y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had not their lamps lighted (according to the iudgement of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpel) deſerued not to enter with the bridgrome: euenſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man by

whom is not performed the dutie of a good Chriſtian, and muchleſſe hath fulfilled the office of a Churchman, may ſtande aſſured, that when de dyeth, he ſhall not be founde amongſt thoſe that are inuited, but paſt ouer to the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of ſuch as are deceiued. That great is the grace which God ſheweth to that man whom he withdrawes from the world and reduceth into holy religion, for that there is more ſuretie to ſtande, and not ſo much ſubiection to fall, and if he ſuffer him to ſtumble, he hath appoynted him helpes to hold him vp, and many readie meanes to repentance: Since that in the Church he hath more oportunitie to ſerue God, and leſſe occaſion to commit ſinne. And albeit, being compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon humors and complexions of corruption, we cannot but erre in thinges corrupt and worldly: Yet ſuch is the care and protection of God ouer thoſe that he loueth and hath called and chozen to the ſeruice &amp; office of the Church, that if ſometimes he ſuffer them to fall the better to make them know him, it is not without the readie aſſiſtance of his hand to helpe them eſſoones to ryſe agayne: Yea, he ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſuffereth them to ſlyde into ſuch faultes, as may geue him occaſion to be angrie with them.</p>
               <p>Therefore, who vnder the habite of religion, riſeth into a minde of Pryde, Ambition, Epicuritie or Malice, is amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt the children of God, the ſame that Satan is to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, <hi>Dathan</hi> amongeſt the <hi>Jſraelites, Saule</hi> amongeſt the Prophets, and <hi>Judas</hi> amongeſt the Apoſtles: Wherein let all men be warned that haue will to enter into Religion, that afore they ſéeke it, they may know wherefore they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, ſince for no other cauſe ought they to come to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Religion but to amend and reforme their liues. For, albeit the ſinceritie of Religion receiue great ſinners. yet, it is with no tolleration to commit heynous Crimes after they be inueſted. What other thing is ment by that Diſcipline of the Scripture, wherein the Lande of Promiſe for traueling in ſmall labors on the Holydayes, they were
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2054:63"/>
commaunded to be ſtoaned. But that to the man of the Church ſinning lightly in Religion, was merit of great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueritie &amp; puniſhment, for that a ſmall ſinne committed in the world, beares an eſtimation of a grieuous crime in the Church. Take héede (ſayth <hi>S. Paule</hi>) that you receiue not the grace of our Lorde in vaine: And what other thing doth he then receiue it in vaine, who makes no reckoning of his election, and cares not to be called to the Church, and deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the worlde. For, as by baptiſme we are ſanctified, euenſo by the profeſſion of the miniſterie we are regenerat.</p>
               <p>Let euerie one then take héede what it is that he takes in hande, afore he beginne to manage ſo holy a function, and whether they be profeſſors by will or by neceſſitie: For, all religions being of the inſtitutions of holy perſonages, as it can not be tollerable that in their miniſters be any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections or want of perfect deuotion and vertue. So, who in the habite of religion, will liue prophanely or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the libertie of the worlde, in that man is no apparance of reformation, and leſſe argument of fayth or vertue. And therfore in the church for ſome perticuler mento be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt and priuileadged then others, or to aſpire aboue the congregation and communitie of the Church in any priuat or familiar prerogatiue: although it may be ſuffered for a time, yet religion can not holde it tollerable long. For, no more then the Sea can beare bodies that be dead, no more hath the Church a nature to brooke in her miniſters mindes of Ambition and Pryde: for which cauſe it is called order, as wherein are conteined all thinges well ordered, which, without this order, cannot but beare to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſion. Who hath once taken the habite of religion, and will ſtill continue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with the cuſtomes of the worlde, and exerciſe his minde in vanities, can not but breake the ſtatutes of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and ſtande in perill of infidelitie, ſince the doctrine of the goſpell, and the libertie of the world could neuer holde ſocietie or fellowſhippe together.</p>

In that fearefull diſcourſe which CHRIST makes of the rich man and <hi>Lazarus</hi> in the other worlde, we finde that the riche man Cryed vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> to haue Pitie on him: at leaſt wiſe that he would ſende <hi>Lazarus</hi> to touch with his Finger the flame and heate of his Tongue: which requeſt, albeit ſéemes to carie no face of importance or greatneſſe, yet the vpright iuſtice of God would neither heare nor helpe him: For that in his proſperitie hauing denied to the pore the very Crummes falling from his Table, by what reaſon could he deſerue a droppe of Water to refreſhe or comfort his neceſſities? And where by the teſtimonie of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we finde that this wretched riche man was both a glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and an epicure in delites of Banquets, Garments, and all other ſenſualities: Yet it is apparant that in no part of his body he féeles ſuch ſorow, as in his Tongue, nor in any ſort commits ſo great ſinnes as in ſpeaking.

And ſo for ende, if to <hi>Cayn, Lucipher, Senacherib,</hi> the builders of the tower of <hi>Babilon,</hi> the Murderer of <hi>Saule,</hi> &amp; the wicked riche man, had not bene ioyned vaine tongues to pronounce diſdainefull and vndiſcréete thinges, it may be beléeued that they had not with ſuch lightneſſe haue loſte their liues in this world, nor in the other, had put their ſouls vnder perpetuall damation.</p>

For that the Harte thinketh onely, the wyll conſentes, the Eares heare, the Handes ſtryke, but to the Tongue is tyed a propertye too Kyll and Sleye. And as our Tongue is none other thinge then as a whyte Wall, whereon the Wyſe man may paynte deuoute I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, and the Foole drawe thinges vayne and fonde: So to him that canne vſe his Tongue well it is an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that may woorke to his Saluation, as of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, who employeth it in ill ſeruices, it is ſufficient to his Damnation. For the Harte béeing the Fordge whereon our Wicked plottes are wrought, then that which our Tongue pronounceth is none other thing then the pryce and publication of the Sinnes which we haue within our Harte.

For, with ſuch care doth the Lorde holde vp ſuch as ſtriue to ſerue him, that he neuer ſuffereth them to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to great ſinnes: But if we doe ſlyde, ſtumble and hurt our ſelues, let vs not be amazed, for euen the ſame infirmities are common to Angels: Therefore when we pray to God, we ought to demaunde with teares and contrition, for, that if he then ſuffer vs to fall, he will alſo geue vs grace to riſe againe. So prouident is the Lorde ouer the vertuous, ſayth the Prophete, and ſo careleſſe to the ſinner, that if the iuſt man ſwimme vpon the mayne Sea, he will not ſuffer him to be drowned: Where the wicked walking vpon the firme Lande ſhall fall headlong into wels and déepe pittes, which the Scripture doth conſter to that foule and huge enormitie of ſinnes of the which he hath no power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.

but that the exercize of ſo vnfayned repentaunce, and confeſſion of, his falt, was a great degrée to his forgiuneſſe.

Here may be gathered to the comfort of all good Chriſtians, that after <hi>Dauid</hi> had ſinned, he went not ſo ſoone to ſearche God, as God was readie to receiue him, whoſe prouidence &amp; perfection is ſuch ouer his chozen, that though they fall in any notorious Crime, yet he ſuffereth them to haue no perſeuerance in it, according to the experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his heauenly bountie expreſſed vpon <hi>S.

Then let all Chriſtians confeſſe the wonderfull clemencie of God, who euen in our negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence goeth out to ſéeke vs: though we praye him not, yet he prayeth vs, and where we forget to call to him, he fayles not to call vpon vs, ſo that if we loaſe our ſelues, and be the inſtruments of our owne deſtruction, it is not ſo much for that we haue ſinned, as for that after our tranſgreſſion, we will not beléeue. Let vs therefore take pleaſure to heare when God calles vs: Let vs be glad to be founde when the Lord ſearcheth vs: Let vs be readie to folow whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he guides vs: Let vs be willing to beléeue, when he takes from vs all deceyt: And let vs thinke vs happie to ſerue him, when he is diſpoſed to pay vs our hire.

as none are compelled to enter into it, ſo it reſiſtes none that knocke at the Gates:) Where <hi>Dauid</hi> ſtoode not to reaſon with himſelfe that he had Sinned in this, or in that: we haue to gather by him that the matter of our Saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſiſtes not ſo much in multiplycation of woordes, as too correct our liues and encreaſe dayly in good déedes. And truely GOD hath no neceſſitie of great Cryes, to the ende he may heare vs, and leſſe néede of many reaſons too per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him too vnderſtande vs, ſince <hi>Dauid</hi> vſed no other ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitor for the remouing of Gods wrath, then the implorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a penitent harte, Crying, <hi>Tibi tibi ſoli peccaui et coram te malum feci:</hi> Yea, though men regarde for the moſt part the expoſition of the Tongue, yet wyth GOD the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the harte ſtandes alwayes moſt acceptable, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in this conuerſion of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who acknowledging ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie that he had ſinned without further diſpute with God, the Lord was neyther ſcrupulous nor ſuſpicious for that he ſpake no more but one woorde, but had regard to the ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the harte where with he repented.

not ſimplicities but filthie enormities, not light vanities, but heauie vices, and not faults done for want of knowlege, but offences committed wyth well aduized will and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.) We haue reaſon to thinke, that if his olde age had bene alſo defiled with crimes and ſinne, he had likewiſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them vp as a ſacrifize with the confeſſion of the abuſes of his youth: By which is wel proued y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> much doth it import when God pardoneth our ſinnes paſt, without ſufferance eftſoones to retourne &amp; fal into them againe: For <hi>Dauid</hi> had no ſooner cryed <hi>Peccaui,</hi> then GOD was readie to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, <hi>Loe heare J forgeue thee:</hi> Whereby it is manifeſt that we are more ſlow to confeſſe our offences, then God to exhibite his mercie.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight excellent Prince: Albeit the long experience I haue had of the modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your will, together with what diſpoſition you haue alwayes affected eſtates and dignities: Yet I haue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer knowne you ſubiect to thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires which for the moſt part gouerne moſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is, to aſpire to kingdoms and principallities. A man to forbeare to winne and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe honor, is out of the limittes of wiſedome, but not to giue libertie to the hart to deſire it, is ſure a vertue more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine then huntaine. For, that man doth enough who reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the action that his handes haue power to execute, and maketh his deſires equall with thinges honeſt, indifferent, and reaſonable: Wherein with iuſt cauſe may I ſay thy Empire is happie, ſince thou haſt done Actes to deſerue it, and vſed no corrupt induſtrie to purchaſe it: For,<note place="margin">Vertue rayſeth vertuous men.</note> dignities apperteining properlie to vertue, vertue of her ſelfe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth
<pb facs="tcp:2054:77"/>
them, to thoſe men to whom her ſelfe is conioyned. There haue bene many Emperours, who haue not bene ſo much honored for the eſtates they haue had, as for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of their vertues by the which they haue bene rayſed vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to them. For, the honor of a man conſiſtes not ſo much in the preſent office he hath, as in the vertues and merittes which followed his lyfe afore: So that it is to offices that men geue new honor, where to the perſonage belonges no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but paine and charge. And therefore remembring for mine owne part, that I haue gouerned thy youth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed thy witte with good learning, I cannot but reioyce as much in thy excellent vertues, as in thy ſupreame. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, alluding to my ſelfe no ſmall happineſſe, that in my time <hi>Rome</hi> hath a Lorde, euen he that hath bene my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple.</p>
               <p>Principalities of tiranie are got by force, &amp; ſuſteyned by Arms, which as I haue always knowne to be far from thy nature &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, ſo haſt thou, now to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou ough<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teſt to doe nothing to bring thée into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> opinion &amp; ſuſpition of men. For, as the Empire is diſcended vnto thée with the voyce and conſent of all men, ſo it belonges to thée to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne it with due iuſtice towardes all ſortes: Wherein, if thou béeſt thankefull to the great God, patient in chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and fortunes, carefull in daungers, mylde to thy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and affable to ſtraungers, not gréedie of riches, nor a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of thy proper deſires, the burden of thy place will be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, thy renoume perpetuall, and all common weales and Poſterities made happie by thy example. I aduize thée with great reaſon, not to be a follower of thy proper deſires, for that there can be no worſe gouernement then that which is managed by Opinion onely: Since he that Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth in a Common Weale, ought to liue in Feare of all but much more of himſelfe, for that much more is he Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to fayle and Erre following his will and fancie, then if hée Followed the Direction of his well aduized Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, aſſuring thée, that too auoyde Infamie too thy ſelfe,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:2054:77"/>
and preiudice to thy People, thou oughteſt firſt to applie Correction to thy ſelfe afore thou Miniſter Diſcipline to others. Therefore, it were good that now that thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeſt, thou ſhouldeſt expreſſe thy ſelfe ſuch one as when thou waſt commaunded: For, other wayes little would it ſerue thée by thy vertues to haue deſerued the Empire, if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes thy want of gouernement made thée vnworthie to vſe it:<note place="margin">It is more wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thy too deſerue honor then too poſſeſſe it.</note> ſince it is more worthy to deſerue honor the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe it. To atteine to honor is a worke humaine, but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it is a grace diuine: And therefore thou haſt to take héede, that though thou art a Souereigne Prince, yet thou haſt no priueleadge to be in all thinges an abſolute Lorde: For, amongſt men there is no authoritie ſo ſupreame which hath not God to be iudge ouer them, and men to be behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of what they doe. In which reſpect, now that thou art a Prince, thou haſt a greater bonde to be good, and leſſe ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to be euil, then when thy eſtate was priuate: So that the authoritie thou haſt got to commaunde, leaues thée leſſe libertie to offende, and no oportunitie at all to follow thy proper recreations. For if thy regiment aunſwere not the expectation of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thy behauiour be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the deſires and opinion of thy olde Mayſter <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarke,</hi> thou canſt not but be ſubiect to many daungers, and offer my aged body into the hands of my aduerſaries to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer reuenge, ſince this is a common cuſtome, that the faultes and abuſes of the Diſciple are tranſferred and heaped vpon the heade of the inſtructor and Mayſter. And therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bene thy teacher, and thou my folower, lyke as the good that thou doſt cannot but bring to me ſome honor, ſo alſo if thou doſt euill, I can not but communicat in the infamie: which happened to <hi>Seneka,</hi> who boare imputation for the cruelties of <hi>Nero,</hi> and the Philoſopher <hi>Chilo</hi> for the follies of his Diſciple <hi>Leander:</hi> Who albeit were perſonages of ſuch vertue as they had the credit to faſhion and gouerne right mightie Princes: Yet for that they flattered their
<pb facs="tcp:2054:78"/>
greatneſſe with libertie and fauor, when they ſhould haue diſtilled into their youth doctrines and rules of direction, they left to themſelues perpetuall infamie, and to many common weales perill of ſubuerſion. And as my penne hath not ſpared to diſcribe Princes &amp; ages paſt, ſo be thou aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Oh Emperour,<note place="margin">No prince but his behauiouris publiſhed.</note> that neyther thy greatneſſe nor my neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence ſhall be fauored of ſuch as are to come: For, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it will not come to paſſe but that ſuch as haue intereſt in the fault, ſhould be alſo inheritors of the Puniſhment. Thou remembreſt what I haue taught thée in thy youth, and wyth what councels I haue inſtructed thy ryper age, neyther art thou ignorant I know with what frankeneſſe I haue debated with thée by Letters ſince thou waſt a Prince, and familiarlie communicated with thée in ſecret: wherein I ſtoode alwayes vppon theſe obſeruations, not to make thée acquainted with any thing which ſhould not bée for the ſeruice of God, for the aduauncement of the common weale, and furthering to thy reputation. And therefore, for any thing I haue written, ſpoken, or perſwaded, I ſtand not in feare to be puniſhed of God after my death, nor to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched of men whileſt I liue, accompting it to belong to the neceſſitie of thy age, &amp; grauitie of my profeſſion, to whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per nothing in thine eare, which I might not haue publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the open Senate. And now, (afore I adreſſed this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnto thée) examining my ſelfe, whether during the time I had thée vnder my Diſcipline, I had done or ſayde in thy preſence any thing which might prouoke thée to ill example, I finde that I neuer did any thing which became not well the ciuilitie of a good <hi>Romane,</hi> nor ſpake worde, which was not fully conuenient with the modeſtie of a correct Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher. So that if it pleaſe thée to make the rules and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thy youth, the compaſſe to direct the courſe of thy high gouernement and Reigne, thou ſhalt finde the néedle of thy lyfe and doinges to draw directly to a renoume of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall fame and felicitie: Wherein I doe not ſo much put
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:2054:78"/>
thée in remembrance, to the end thou ſhouldeſt gratifie me, but becauſe thy lyfe being well inſtructed, there may folow better ſeruice and ſucceſſe to thy eſtate, eſtéeming it inough for my recompence to vnderſtande that the worlde holdes thee a good man.<note place="margin">Princes ought not to meaſure thinges by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte but by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</note> I beſéeche thée take this laſt councell in good parte, that albeit thou art rayſed to the Empire, it is not for that thou art of the houſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> but becauſe thou haſt bene a follower of vertue, who willeth Princes, not to meaſure thinges by common report of the People, but by iuſtice and equitie of conſcience.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fore I had halfe read thy Letter, I had coniecture it came from thée, not ſo much for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> experience I haue of thy forme of writting, as by the grauitie of the matter it conteineth, the ſame being the occaſion that I redde it often, ſéeming therein to ſée thée write, and heare thée ſpeake: yea I cauſed it to be redde at my Table, to the ende thy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might be knowne, and I put in remembrance how much I owe to thée. Where thou canſt not belieue (as thou ſaieſt) that I ſolicited the Kingdome, nor aſpired to it by corrupt meanes, I will not denie but as a man I haue deſired it, forbearing notwithſtanding to riſe to it by broakage or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. For that I neuer knewe any man purchaſe honor by brybes, to whom the meane of ſuch honor was not the cauſe of ſome notable infamie, as is truely veryfied in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the good olde man <hi>Menander,</hi> who, for that hée practized the conſulſhip by money, was paſt into Exile, and
<pb facs="tcp:2054:79"/>
ſo (by the due iuſtice of the higheſt) loſt his honor, his goodes, and lyfe. It was a doctrine reade in thy Vniuerſitie, that more ought men to labor to deſerue honor, then to be bolde to procure it,<note place="margin">That is vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full which is got by vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes.</note> eſtéeming that vnlawfull which is gotten by vnlawfull meanes. He that is without credit ought to labor to winne it: And who is in infamie let him ſtudie to bée made worthie of honor: But the man of vertue hath neuer no want of nobilitie, and much leſſe can his honor be taken from him: ſince honor is ioyned to vertue as the brier is to the reaſe, and though all other thinges be of fortune, yet true Nobilitie dependes of vertue, as the houſe vppon his foundation. Many men haue refuzed offices, and yet much leſſe that they liued in leſſe loue and eſtimation, ſéeing the diſclayming of dignities brought to them more honor then al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> victories they wonne in the warres, for that the ſucceſſe of Conqueſtes follow for the moſt parte the iudgement of fortune, but the deniall of office and charge lyeth onely in the wiſedome of man. I aſſure thée when the enſeigne of the Empire was preſented to me, I was no leſſe ignorant of the chaunce then out of hope of the dignitie, knowing that it was ſolicited by others wyth no meane practize and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions. But ſeeing it is the prouidence of the great God to make me his miniſter béeing called with the conſent and will of all men, and that I haue aſſurance in thy aduice and councell, I doubt not but God will communicate with me in the gouernement, and reſtraine fortune for geuing me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch ſodeine mutation as may chaunge the courage and conſtancie of my minde: Aſſuring thée y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I acknowledge me to haue bene thy Diſciple, euen with the ſame ioy where with thou ſaieſt thou haſt taught me, &amp; now ſéeſt me Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Wherin ſéeing y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> wilt not from henceforth but call me Lorde, I will neuer ſpeake of thée by other name then Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And albeit I haue bene ſought to, and councelled of many ſince my election to the kingdome, yet amongeſt all, I reſerue my ſelfe to bée familiar onely with thée, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:2054:79"/>
that in ſuch as ſue to giue me councell, is an intention to draw my will to theirs, where I know thou wilt not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uize me but for my profit and commoditie of my honor. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times I haue heard thée ſay,<note place="margin">Such as giue councell to prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces ſhould be free from paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> that in ſuch as geue Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell to Princes ſhould be libertie and fréedome from all paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and affections. For that in the action of Councell gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, where the will is moſt inclined, there the ſpirite and witte haue moſt ſtrength. That a Prince in all thinges doe his will, I doe not allow, and that he take Councell of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one, is leſſe ſéemely: Therefore as to the affaires of a kingdome cannot but be a great neceſſitie of aduice, ſo let the Prince make this choyſe of his Councellors,<note place="margin">VVhat counce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lors Princes ought to chuſe.</note> rather to be Councelled by thoſe of whom he is loued, then by ſuch as himſelfe loueth. For, in the affection of the Counceller to his Prince is great ſecuritie and care of the common buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, where from ſuch as be followers of the Prince, can grow no great matter of prouidence for the publike ſafetie as being men all together dedicated to the complexion and humors of the Prince. Wherin hauing had long experience of thy déepe inſight in matters of policie, and no leſſe expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that thou wilt vſe no leſſe care to direct me now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Prince, then thou tookeſt paynes to inſtruct me when I followed thée as thy Diſciple: I will that from henceforth to thée belong the chiefe charge to geue me Councell in my moſt weightie affaires, and to aduertize me of the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and faultes that from time to time appeare in me. For, as <hi>Rome</hi> holdes me for the protector of their common weale, ſo I reſerue thée to be the beholder and examiner of me lyfe. And if at any time thou findeſt me frowarde to be warned by thée in thinges neceſſarie for my reformation: I pray thée conſter it not to any diſpleaſure towardes thée: Since, in ſuch caſe, my paſſion ſhall not be for the warnings thou géeueſt mée, but for the Shame that I haue Erred. And as to haue bene noriſhed in thy houſe, to haue hearde thy Lectures, to haue imitated thy doctrines, and to haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb facs="tcp:2054:80"/>
vnder thy Diſcipline, haue bene (ſure) principall means to preferre me to the Empire: So, it cannot but be aſcribed too great inhumanitie to thée, if thou forbeare to helpe me to manage and guide that which thou haſt procured me to win &amp; get, eſtéeming it I aſſure thée, to my great felicitie to haue familaritie with ſuch one as y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> whoſe wiſedome makes thée worthie to be a iudge of my Councelles, and in thy fayth I may be bolde to repoze the Controlement of my lyfe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, where thou aduizeſt me to continue ſuch one as I was before, with condition not to decline, I beleue thou draweſt this warning from the example of <hi>Nero,</hi> whoſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement béeing well ordered for the firſt fiue yeares of his Reigne, he grewe afterwardes to encreaſe more in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe then in dignitie. But rather then thou ſhalt finde me ſucceſſor to the impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cies and vileneſſe of <hi>Nero,</hi> I pray thée pray to God to giue me no ſuffera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to reigne in <hi>Rome,</hi> ſince that Tyrantes procure dignities to exercize Crueltie, and good men aſpire to kingdomes to the end to maintaine vertue.<note place="margin">By the miſerie of vnfortunate men others are warned to take heede.</note> And therefore to ſuch as were good afore, and are corrupt by the place, there is more cauſe of pytie then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice: For that if fortune rayſe them, it is not to honor them, but to make them fall.

Children loaze a good Father, and a whole comunaltie a iuſt &amp; vertuous prince, there can be no ſorow more intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, or that worldly men cannot ſuffer loſſes of more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie importance:<note place="margin">Princes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weales are the ſame that God is too ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> (ſince good Princes are the ſame to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weales, that God is to ſinners, who, though we forget to loue and obey him, yet he forbeares not to protect and prouide for vs. The death of a good man deſerues to be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed of all, but the loſſe of a iuſt Prince ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely and bitterly lamented: for that when a priuate man dyeth, there is loſt but one, but when a good Prince is taken away there dyeth with him the felicitie of a whole kingdome: So that if GOD would ſuffer vs to ſell the liues of good Princes already deade, the price ſure would be to baſe to buy them againe with tears, ſince, euen with the moſt precious Golde and ſiluer can not be weighed downe the price and Raunſome of a vertuous man. If Treaſure would haue redéemed the lyfe of <hi>Hector,</hi> the <hi>Troyans</hi> would haue furniſhed it in great aboundance: or if money might eftſoones haue breathed life into <hi>Haniball,</hi> there would haue bene found no want in the <hi>Carthaginiens.</hi> But God,<note place="margin">God hath autho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritie too diſpoſe all thinges by the ſame pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er where with he created them of nothing.</note> hauing made all mortall thinges, hath authoritie to diſpoze of them euen by the ſame power wherwith he hath Created them of nothing, reſeruing onely to himſelfe Immortalitie. How reuerent is the vertue of good men, and with what preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues they are indued, appears eaſelie in this, that men beare more honor to the Sepulchers of the vertuous, then to the emboaſted Palaices of the wicked. The good and vertuous man, though he bée farre abſent and out of vſe and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, yet men loue him, ſerue him, and aunſwere for him, where, to the wicked is geuen no credit in that he ſayth, and much leſſe are we thankefull to him in that hée doth for vs. For, to the euill man is appoynted this propertie of iuſtice,<note place="margin">Due iuſtice for a wicked man.</note> to be doubted moſt where he would fayneſt haue credit, and not to be beleued though he ſpeake the trueth. Touching my election to the Empire, as it was left by my predeceſſor, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded

of the People, and approued by you, ſo I doubt not but my gouernment will be ſo much the more plauſible and profitable to <hi>Rome,</hi> by how much in my adoption were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled all thinges agréeable to God. And as it ſerues to little for men to chuſe Princes, if they be not confirmed by God. So, there be certaine ſignes to diſcerne ſuch as are called by God from others choſen by men. For, that which men by ſodeine Councell aduaunceth, God by due iuſtice bringes downe: where thoſe things which the mightie God planteth, albeit they ſtande open to all windes and receiue many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities, yet they neuer fall, yea, though they incline and bende, there is no power to remoue them. You know that albeit I was Nephewe to your predeceſſor, yet I neuer ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited him for the kingdome, and much leſſe occupied my thoughtes to hope for it, hauing learned of my Mayſter <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarke,</hi> that honor ought rather to be deſerued then purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And as I will not denie but that a kingdome is a ſwéete pray, and that the preſent of ſo high and excellent a dignitie was welcome to me with inwarde gladnes: So alſo I can not but confeſſe that I finde great difference betwéene the trauelles of a Kingdome, and the ſecuritie of a priuate lyfe: yea, after I had taſted of what bitter cares this ſwéete pray is compounded, I was ſorie my weakneſſe was ſo ſoone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed, though it be too late to repent. For, of ſuch qualitie is Imperie and gouernement, that if there be great honor to haue it,<note place="margin">Princes ſubict to many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities.</note> there is no leſſe paine and trauell to wéelde it. Oh to how many perplexities ſtandes he Subiect, who byndes himſelfe to gouerne others: For that, if he be iuſt, they will call him cruell: if he be pytifull, they will diſpize him: if hée be liberall, they will hold him prodigall: if he be a huſband of that he hath, they will ſay he is couetous: If he be peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, they will eſtéeme him a cowarde: if he be couragious, they will impute it to quarrelling: if he be graue, they wil note him proude: if he be affable, they will aſcribe it light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſimplicitie: if he be ſolitarie they will iudge him
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:2054:81"/>
an Ipocrite: and if he be mery they will ſay he is diſſolute. So that men moſt commonly wil vſe more reſpect towards all others, then towardes him that gouerneth the whole. For, to the Prince they accompt the morcelles that he ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, they meaſure his paſes, they eſpie his wordes, they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue what companie he kepeth, they iudge his workes, they are Ielouſe ouer his Lookes and Ieſtures: Yea, they exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and murmure at his Paſtimes, and make coniecture euen of his ſecret thoughtes: Who then weygheth wyth the trauelles that bréede in principality, the Ielouſies that ſtande as eſpialles ouer ſuch as gouerne: will confeſſe (I doubt not) that as there is no eſtate more ſure then that that is deuided from Empire and rule. So, gouernement béeing none other thing then the Foarge of enuie, the beſt cure and remedie is to forbeare to be abſolute, and liue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with us eſtate priuate: For, if a man can not but with great paine gouerne a Wyfe whom he hath chozen: trayne vp his Children whom he hath begotten: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct his ſeruant whom he hath hyered hauing them all in his houſe. Farre greater paine ſhall he finde to enterteyne in one peace and vnitie a whole common weale deuided in to ſtraunge diſpoſitions. Sure the lyfe of Princes deſerue great compaſſion, for that in fewe can they repoſe or truſt, ſéeing often times they are moſt detected by thoſe whom they moſt fauor: they can not eate without watching, ſléepe without garde, ſpeake without Ielouſie,<note place="margin">Perplexities of Princes.</note> nor go without e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiall, ſo that being Lordes ouer all, yet they are Priſoners euen to their proper vaſſals: Yea, if we conſider the ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Princes, and the libertie of ſubiectes, we ſhall finde that in whom the kingdome hath moſt action, euen againſt him ſeruitude hath moſt power, ſo that though princes haue authoritie to geue libertie to others, yet their place will not ſuffer them to miniſter it to themſelues: God hauing Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs frée, we doe ſo delight to haue our libertie frée, that how neare ſo euer a man tough vs eyther in frendſhip, kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,

will not ſuffer them to be forgotten of their frends, nor van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed of their enemies. I wiſhe you alſo to communicate together in one frendſhip and fraternitie: For that, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weales greater are the harmes that riſe by ciuill facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of one neighbour againſt an other, then by the furie of forreine and publike enemies: I wiſhe you to cutte of all occaſions of quarrelles, to be cheriſhers of the poore, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of the Fatherleſſe, and protectors of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Wydows: For that,<note place="margin">Vertue conſiſts more in works then in wordes.</note> to none is God wont to miniſter more ſharpe iuſtice then to ſuch as reſtraine compaſſion to the pore, &amp; ſuffer the innocent to receiue oppreſſion. And, becauſe vertue conſiſtes more in workes, then in wordes: I exhort you to vſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie in ſpéeche: to be patient to ſuffer: and prouident in your forme of liuing. For, it cannot but bring great falt and ſhame to a gouernour, to giue prayſes to the people of his common weale, and in himſelfe beare iuſt occaſion of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion: And therefore to ſuch as manage eſtates and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernementes, it apperteynes to haue more confidence in their workes then in their wordes: For that the common People is more enclined to iudge of that which they ſée, then to beléeue thinges which they heare. In affaires concerning the <hi>Senate,</hi> I would not haue any of you noted of Ambicion, Malice Fraude, nor Enuie: For that, to men of honor, truth and vertue, it is vnſéemely to contende more for the Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigntie and commaundement of a common weale, then for the aduauncement and profite of it. The Empire of the <hi>Greekes,</hi> hath bene alwayes contrarie to the gouernement of the <hi>Romaines</hi> aſwell in Armes and Lawes, as in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: For, the <hi>Grecians</hi> had a ſinguler felicitie in eloquent ſpeaking, and to vs hath belonged the propertie of wel wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: By this I exhort you being aſſembled in the Senate y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you beſtow not more time to diſpute &amp; arguing of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies, then neceſſarilie apperteines to the true ſearch and deciſion of the ſame: Since, if you will not entangle your iudgementes with paſſion and affections, you ſhall (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:2054:83"/>
long argument) be eaſelie led to reaſon and concluſion. In this reſpect, many wiſe men haue thought it more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient that kinges and Emperours ſhould ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be gouerned by men learned, then to be learned themſelues: Forbidding them thereby to leaue to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per opinions, of the which for the moſt parte they ought to be ſuſpicious. Let your iudges and ſuch as ſitte in office to ſolicit the affaires of the common weale, be wiſe men, ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in lawes, expert in cuſtomes, diſcréete in thinges they haue to iudge, and circumſpect in their conuerſation and forme of lyfe. For, in inſtruction of lyfe and manners, more good doth the iudge w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his good example, then with his ſeuere puniſhement: and to the well gouernement of a common weale, more conducible and neceſſarie is the wiſe man, then he that is too wel learned. Therfore in cauſes of iuſtice and iudgement, haue regarde to miniſter the Lawes in Ciuill proceſſes, and in matters criminall it is good to moderate their rigor: For that in the Creation of ſeuere and cruell Laws, the chiefe purpoſe was rather to kepe men in terror, then to haue the Lawes committed to extreame action: So that afore the publication of your ſentence, you ought to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the age of the offender, the time, the manner, the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the confederacie, and the value of the offence, in all which circumſtances may be helpes, though not to acquite the treſpaſſe, yet to qualifye the rigor of the law: in the adminiſtration and office whereof we, ought to deale in the ſame rate and meaſure of mercie towards offenders, which God vſeth with ſinners, on whom he exerciſeth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion aboue their deſertes, and puniſheth them vnder the merite of their tranſgreſſions. And as in criminall offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Iudges ought to thinke that God is more offended then men: So, if it pleaſe him to remitte faultes done agaynſt his maieſtitie, it is a good example to warne vs not to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Laws extreamely againſt thoſe that offend others and not vs. Laſtly, I wiſhe you (in caſes of quarrell and

wrong) that if your enemies doe you any iniurie, you will forbeare preſent reuenge: For that, to pardon many for the offence of one, holdes of the office of Chriſtianitie, but to chaſtice many for the falt of one, apperteynes properly to Tirantes.<note place="margin">It is better ſome time to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an iniurie then to reuenge it.</note> Yea, though in mans nature the diſpight of an iniurie encreaſeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deſire of reuenge: yet, there be wrongs wherein often times men finde more ſewertie to diſſemble them then to reuenge them.</p>

               <p>Thou muſt not forget to haue patience to ſuffer ſuch as are importunate, and diſſemble with offendors: ſéeing it is a propertie dulie anexed to a good Prince, to puniſhe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries of the common weale, and pardon the inſolences done agaynſt himſelfe. And as it belonges to a good Prince to haue more regarde to the benefite of his Countrey, then to the delightes of his perſon: So, where thou writeſt that thou wilt not ſée <hi>Rome</hi> til thou haſt giuen end to the warres of <hi>Germanie,</hi> we cannot but holde it a determination of a noble and valiant Emperour: For that ſuch good Princes as thou art ought not to ſéeke out places for their recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but follow exerciſes to encreaſe their reputation. Thou recommendeſt to vs the veneration of the Temples and Seruice of God: we beſéeche thée let that be an office iuſt and equall to thée alſo: ſince, our ſeruice to God can be a Sacrifice but of ſmall importance, if with all thou makeſt it not perfect with the offer of the humilitie, obedience, and conſent of thy harte. According to thy Councel, that wée hold frendſhip and communitie one with an other, we finde it a charge of very harde action, if in thée be not alſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed an equall and generall affection to vs all: For that, by the parcialitie of Princes embraſing ſome more then the reſt, are oftentimes rayſed factions and murmures amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt the People.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of their ſtomacke, and in caſe of infirmities in their legges, they haue their oyles to ſupple them, their rollers to wrap them, their hoaze at libertie &amp; their buſkins buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: and if any grudge at this brauerie, they haue to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that it is done more for the eaſe of the diſeaſe that troubleth them, then for any glory they reappoſe in ſuch at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire. It is a cuſtome with old men, to enquire after the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the wether, wherein they haue great ſence and iudgement by the motion of their infirmities, whoſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors following the reuolution of the Moone, and change &amp; diſtemper of the ayre, bring the poore old man to be halfe a phiſition, and to haue a painefull ſcience in Aſtronomie. It is a cuſtome with old men to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine much of the trauels of the day, and to kéepe reckoning of the houres of the night, that their dinner is not reſolued into diſgeſtion, and their ſupper would not ſuffer them to ſléepe: and yet, it is no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner day then they begin to murmure that their breakfaſt is not readie. It is a priuilege to old men to ſearch companie, and either in temple, tauerne, or ſhoppes they enterteyne al that come, enquiring of the newes of the world: and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they heare, be it true or falſe, they will not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue

To ſome old men it is a cuſtome to haue familiaritie with phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and friendſhip with Potticaries: but ſome delite more to haunt tauernes where is vent of good wine, then in the conference of learned men by whom is miniſtred whole ſome regiments of health: it belongs much to olde men to be fickle in all things but ſpecially to be inconſtant againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time, commending much the ages paſt, and complayning more of the ſeaſon preſent: which for the moſt part they do more of cuſtome then by any reaſon, and rather by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, then for neceſſitie: It is due to old men to wrap and cheriſh themſelues, to haue their chamber hanged, their fire ordinarie, their bed warmed, and yet for the moſt part, they ſpend the nights in coughing, and the dayes in complaints, making their bed a place to debate the actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of their youth paſt, and to féele the infirmities and weaknes of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent age: the memorie of which thinges makes them often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo ill contented that they are careleſſe to prouide for death which they ſée euen afore their eyes. And it is one common propertie with old men to be angrie with ſuch as enquire of their age, and moſt familiar with thoſe that will tell of the pleaſures they haue paſt. So that, they would be honored by reaſon of their age, and yet they are grieued when they heare a reckoning of their yeres, and ſo old men delite in authorttie, &amp; yet wiſh their age might be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cealed.</p>

Theſe wordes ſpoken by the Philoſopher to the reproch of his enemie, deſerue to be applied to all men, for that there are none that can worthely challenge the true merit and imputation of wiſemen, if they expreſſe not as great modeſtie in their ſpéech, as equitie in their workes: it is a iuſt thing that euery one take héede to that he doth, and be well aduiſed in what he ſayth, ſince amongeſt noble mindes more eaſely is ſatiſfied an actuall wrong done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their perſons, then an iniurious word vttered to the preiudice of their honour, alwayes eſteming that the blowe of a ſword hurtes but the fleſh, but a word ſuggeſted to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie offendeth the reputation. This I ſay (ſir) vppon the occaſion of your letter charging me eftſones to repeat my late diſcourſe vttered in the preſence of the Emperour vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this theame, <hi>that it is very hurtfull to haue Christ to our enemie, and a thing no leſſe daungerous to haue man our friend:</hi> If, in your opinion I ſpeake any thing which was not well ſtudied and conſidered vppon, you do wrong to the grauetie of my profeſſion, ſince it is my cuſtome, neuer to pronounce wordes of ſuch deuine and high ſubiect, but euen with the

ſame attention and deuocion wherewith I would confeſſe my ſelfe to God, accompting it withall to too great a fault to publiſh any thing which might bréede ſcrupull in your Lordſhip, or murmure in ſo excellent an auditorie.</p>
               <p>But now to our purpoſe, wherein I confirme eftſones, that if it be euill to haue the creator to our enemie, it can not be leſſe daungerous to haue to our friend the creature. And if there be no neceſſitie to employ the Phiſition and our friend but in times daungerous and doutfull, it can not but be to men a moſt aſſured counſell rather to eſchew perils, then to entreate friendes: ſince friends being of the world, their friendſhip hath alſo his corruption of the world, in whom is more confuſion then continuance of thinges. I do not ſay it is euill to haue friends, but that it is daungerous and painefull: for that the mightie thy friend is of eſtate,<note place="margin">It is dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geours too haue great frendes.</note> by ſo much is thy daunger the greater to proue him, and thy care no leſſe to obſerue and kéepe him, ſéeing ſpecially great friendſhip is not knowne but in extreme neceſſitie. Many and many are there now a dayes who would abſtaine from many haynous and hurtfull faultes, if they had not confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the fauour and reſkew of their friends, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a braunch of impunitie, can not but bring perill to a common weale where the due courſe &amp; ſinceritie of iuſtice is ſtopped by the corruption of perticuler fauour. This is one maner of election of friendes amongeſt men, that mée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by chaunce, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moning together, or eating at one ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they ſuppoſe from the inſtant a perpetuall friendſhip to be eſtabliſhed betwene them, which in good certaintie &amp; truth can not be ſo, for that in times of neceſſitie and trial, there is no more proofe or effect of ſuch friends, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betwene the Crowe and the Kyte, of whom when it hapneth to the one to be bare of fethers, the other aunſwereth that to him is no more then ſufficeth him to flie. That which one friend doth for an other in theſe times, is, eyther to excuſe or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seale himſelfe when there is néede of him, being more ready
<pb facs="tcp:2054:89"/>
to lend him his conſcience, then his money, that is eyther to go with him to the reuenge of an enemie, or to perfourme ſome exployt of vice, or at leaſt to ſerue his turne with ſome falſe teſtimonie. Which ſort of friendes, as they are moſt common and leaſt rare, ſo let all men eſteme it no ſmall fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie to be deuided from them, ſéeing they are more prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall of their conſcience then liberall of their goods. Who waigheth with the number of friends that are profeſſed to hint, how many haue miniſtred the true office and qualitie of frendes to giue ſuccours to his neceſſities, for one that he hath founde faythfull, I doubt not but he ſhall be hable to diſcloſe an hundreth deſſemblers: In which reſpect, I ſayd not without great reaſon, that it was great perill to a man not to be conſociate with a frende honeſt, firme, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, ſince, for no greaten cauſe then the action of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reuerence and ciuilytie, they are readie to require our goodds to loane, commaunde the vſe and ſeruice of our houſe, and not ſticke to bring our conſcience in doubt, (occaſions that many times mooue men to diſclaime neighbourhoodes and frendſhips which they had begone in great good wil and deuotion. But right bleſſed and holy is the frendſhippe of Ieſus Chriſt, wherein can be no ſcrupull nor daunger. For that, in recompence of the affection he beares vs, he neyther demaundes our goodes, nor trobleth our conſcience: his frendſhip is alwayes aſſured, for that it is wel eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: it is certeine, ſince he neuer forgets vs: it is not fayned, ſince it correctes our conſcience: it is iuſt for that it ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth nothing vnreaſonable: it is righteous ſince in it hée doth communicate to vs his grace, and it is moſt riche and plentiful as by whoſe meane he geues vs his glory. So that he onely may and ought to be called a frende holy, a frende iuſt, faythfull, profitable, and perpetual: For that the frends that he takes, he lookes not if they riche, and much leſſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtéemes it to diſhonor if they be pore, he chuſeth for his frend whom he lyketh and after he haue once called him, he neuer
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:2054:89"/>
forbeareth to loue and lyke him: He looketh not whether he be mightie or impotent, faire or deformed, or whether his condition be frée or bonde: No, he makes not ſo great rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning of the ſeruices we doe him, as of the loue which we beare to him: <hi>Jn charitate perpetua delexite:</hi> The loue, ſaith Ieſus Chriſt by his Prophete, where with Chriſt loueth vs, is not feyned nor tranſitorie, but reteyneth always one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall &amp; ſetled ſtability, as appeareth moſt truely in this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by the meane of his grace we are made agréeable to him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are able to doe any thing to deſerue to be his frends: Such is the perpetuall perfection of his charitie, that the loue that he bears vs being his owne, the profit that comes of it apperteyns to vs, pretending no other thing in the loue which he beares to all Creatures then to make ſéene his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereigne bountie employed on our behalfes in moſt highe and worthie Charitie: the ſame being well expreſſed in the day of his Paſſion, when neyther the tormentes of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, nor the wickedneſſe of his People, could reſtraine the courſe of his great loue wherewith he Prayed for ſuch as Crucifyed him, and pardone thoſe that offended him: Yea, he prayed not onely for his Apoſtles and Diſciples, but alſo for all the faythfull that beléeued in him and loued his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with whom as he was one ſelfe thing in Diuinitie, ſo he prayed to his Father, that all ſuch as beléeued might be in him one body miſticall through Charitie. Great was the loue of Ieſus Chriſt in the wordes of his petition to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſéeing that albeit we were not then borne, no nor our farre auncient Fathers: yet he beſought his Father in great feruencie for the eſtate of all his Church euen no leſſe then for thoſe that dyd communicate with him in the Supper. So that as he dyed for all, ſo he prayed for all: By which we haue good reaſon to beléeue, that ſéeing be remembred vs afore we came into the world, he will alſo kepe care o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſuch as are employed in his ſeruice. If Chriſt had not loued vs with that Charitie, and prayed for vs in ſuch fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencie
<pb facs="tcp:2054:90"/>
of zeale, what had become of vs: Sure, if there be in the Church of God at this preſent any obedience, patience, charitie, humilitie, or any abſtinence or continencie, it ought all to be atributed to that loue which Chriſt expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the prayer that he commended to his Father for vs, Redéeming with his bloud our diſfauour, and with his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he reſtored vs eftſoones to an eſtate of Grace and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement. To loue thoſe that are preſent, and ſuch as are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to beare affection to the Quicke, and remember ſuch as are Dead happeneth often &amp; is naturall, but to loue ſuch as are to come and not yet borne, is a zeale that neuer was hearde of but in the perſon of our Redéemer, who prayeth for ſuch as liue wickedly, and loueth good men although they are not yet borne: In worldly thinges, ſo ſtraight is the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation and vnitie betwéene lyfe and death, loue and hate, him that doth affect, and the thing affected, that al takes end together and in one houre: But to the frendſhip that Ieſus Chriſt beares vs, belonges an other qualetie, for that his loue tooke beginning afore the foundation of the world, and will not ende, no not at the day of iudgement.</p>

So that the compariſon béeing ſo different, it cannot be poſſible that being your Maſter, I ſhould beare vnto you the due reſpects of a frende: ſince, if I be your Mayſter, you are bounde to ſerue me, feare me, follow me, and obey me: Offices preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall to the prerogatiues of a frende, and againſt the laws of that libertie and frée ſouereignetie which the hart of man deſireth.</p>
               <p>To require me with ſuch raſheneſſe to be your frende, is (ſure) to demaunde of me the moſt precious Iewell I haue in the worlde: For, to be your frende, is to binde me to loue you all my lyfe, deuiding my hart into youres,<note place="margin">Offices of a friend.</note> and making you euen an other moytie with my ſelfe, true frendſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none other thing then an vnfayned conſent of will and affections, and a tranſportation of two hartes into one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: And therefore two frendes, if they will loue and liue in the true obſeruations of frendſhip, ought to ſpeak but wyth one Tongue, and loue with one harte, yea, they ought to Communicate together in one ſubſtance and rate of lyfe, and not grudge to ſuffer in common one perculier and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler death: Amongeſt frendes, what is ſuffered of the one, ought not to be intollerable to the other, and albeit their thoughtes be proper to themſelues, yet their perſons, their goodes and fortunes, ought alwayes to be common: One frende ought not to ſay to an other I will not, or I cannot, ſince, it is principall priueleadge in frendſhip to finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing impoſſible.

By the Councell of <hi>Seneka</hi> the wiſe and diſcréete man ought to admitte but one frende, forſéeing withall (as neare as he can) to haue no enemie at all: For, ſayth he, if there be dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger in enemies, there can be no ſuretie in the multitude of frendes, ſince, in reſpect of their nomber, they bréede difference of conſent and will with varietie of condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, and where is no conformitie of manners, there can be no perfection in frendſhip. So ſtraight is the rule of frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that of many that profeſſe liberall affection, there are fewe that performe it, being an office perticuler to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of vanitie to haue readie tongues to promiſe and ſlowe handes to performe: True frendes are bounde to féele the aduerſities of their frendes with no leſſe affection then if they had proper intereſt in them: yea, it belonges to them to miniſter remedie to their neceſſities, and geue comfort to their miſeries, eſtéeming it to apperteine to their dutie to communicate in all the fortunes of their frendes: The ſame agréeing with the reſolution of <hi>Eſchinus</hi> the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher who being aſked what was the greateſt perplexitie of this lyfe, aunſwered, that to loaſe thinges which we haue got with paine, and to be deuided from that which we loue, are the greateſt afflictions that can trauell a humaine minde.<note place="margin">The frend who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we chuſe ought: to be wiſe and welthie.</note> The frende whom we chuſe, ought aboue all other thinges to be diſcréete, to the ende he may Councell vs, and of habilitie and wealth, the better to adminiſter to our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities and lackes: For other wayes, if he beare no aduiſe and iudgement, wée ſhall want Councell to gouerne our proſperitie, and if he be pore, what meane is there to ioyne ſuccours to our wantes? by which imperfection our proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ſtandes in hazarde for want to be warned, and in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie we are ſubiect to diſpaire or murmure by the into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable

In which reſpect, that man is poſſeſt of no ſmall treaſure who hath admitted ſocietie with a wiſe and wel aduiſed friend, whoſe qualitie ought to be ſuch as to comfort his friend with his eye, to counſel him with his ſpéech, to ſuccour him with his goods, to protect him with his power, and not only to do his beſt to kéepe him from falling, but if he be downe, to lend him his liberall hand to remount him. To the qualetie of our friend it appertaines to be diſcréete and ſecret,<note place="margin">A friend muſt be doſcreete and ſecret.</note> leaſt his lightnes make him intollerable to vs, and being lauiſh, hée can not but be troubleſome to our affaires: and therefore as the boſome of our friend ought to be a place of retraict for al our counſels, opinions, actions, and enterpriſes, ſo, in the election of him, if we firſt ſéeke that we would, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that we moſt feare, ſince true friendſhip to young men is a notable ſobrietie, to old men an infalliable comfort, to the poore ſufficient riches, and to the rich aſſured honour. Let no man diſcloſe the ſecrets of his heart, but to ſuch as he loueth with all his hart: ſince it is one chiefe branch of the office of a good friend to kéepe that he heareth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale what he ſéeth, and therewithall a rule moſt infallible that who ſpeakes without diſcretion ſhalbe aunſwered
<pb facs="tcp:2054:92"/>
with ſhame and confuſion. A true friend ought neuer to flatter his friend, nor ioyne reproch to any pleaſure he hath done for him, taking it for his recompence, that he hath don pleaſure to him to whom he is bound by the merit and law of true friendſhip. For, in caſe of daunger and neceſſitie there ought betwene friends to be no delay of ſuccours, no, no remedie ought to be required where all thinges are due by iuſtice, nothing ought to be holden perticular where all things deſerue to be in common, nor no importunitie int<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, where ought to be no neceſſitie of requeſt. It is not proper to all men to profeſſe the qualetie of a friend: for that if they haue power, they may want diſpoſition, if they haue counſel they may haue weakenes of action, and if they haue mindes to loue, yet they may be ſubiect to the error of inconſtancie, ſo that in caſe of friendſhip men can haue no ſuch full perfection, but that in ſome reſpect they ſuffer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie either by perſon or qualetie. And ſo if you waigh the office of a friend with the inconueniences annexed, and conſider the ſtate of a Lord with the ſeruices appertaining, I hope you will neither reteyne me for a maiſter, nor chuſe me for a friend, ſince for the one I am vnhable, and to the other vnapt.</p>

Gods at commaundement to acquite your ſinnes and giue you place amongeſt the iuſt, ſéeing you condemne others and iuſtifye your ſelfe: Wherein it ſéemes you remember not that to God onely is reſerued the trueth of the ſecret of ſuch as are ordeyned to be ſaued, and appoynted to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: So that if this <hi>Moare</hi> beleue in God as well as you, if he be Baptized as lawfully as you, if he go to the Church with as good deuotion as you, and if we ſée him doe no act, but of a Chriſtian, and in you is found no miracle: I ſée not how you haue any authoritie to call him Infidell, no more then he hath reaſon to doubt you to be a Chriſtian. They be wordes of great raſheneſſe one man to vpbreade an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wyth ſuch iniuries: Séeing that to be a good Chriſtian, we are not onely bounde to doe good déedes, but alſo to vſe modeſtie and my loneſſe in our ſpeach: otherways if a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian call his neighbour Foole he ſhall be guiltie of Hell. And as there is no great difference of the iniurie for one man to call an other Foole, and to call him Dogge: So, to a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued into the fayth, there can not be a greater reproche then to be called an euill Chriſtian: For that to be tearmed Foole tendes but to the preiudice of the reputation of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but to be called a wicked Chriſtian toucheth a mans ſoule and defaceth his renoume: So that if Chriſt forbyd vs Chriſtians to call one an other Foole, much leſſe can he brooke the outrage of greater iniuries: Since by the Schole and rule of his Law we are taught to imbraſe one an other wyth ſuch ſinceritie, as neyther to ſtryke wyth our handes, nor reproche or ſlaunder wyth our Tongues: When I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke you for miniſtring ſuch inciuilitie to the poore <hi>Moare,</hi> you aunſwered that it was an auncient cuſtome of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

In this article and in the former, are declared the degrées by the which the ſonne of God diſcended,<note place="margin">The Ladder or degrees where<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by Chriſt diſcen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </note> and embaſed himſelf euen to thinges incredible for a perſonage of that dignitie. The firſt degrée was to make him man, and to vouchſafe to be borne at a time certaine, he which was borne eternally. The ſecond was that he yet humbled himſelf more to ſuffer ſentence and publike condemnation as a malefactor. In the third, he tooke vppon him the torments of the croſſe, a death moſt cruell, and more infamous then any other ſort of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. By the fourth, he was content to ſuffer death not as God, albeit being God, but as man, in ſuch ſort as the very perſon of God ſuffred death. In the fifth, he ſuffred himſelfe to be buried as others that were dead, making himſelfe like them in all thinges as if he had bene comprehended vnder the curſe of <hi>Adam</hi> to retorne into duſt whereof he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: yea he that was frée from ſinne and the curſe. And by the laſt ſteppe or degrée he diſcended into hel, whether were diſcended ſuch as ſtood deſtitute of their proper iuſtice, to the end to open to them the gate of the kingdome of heauen. By theſe degrées, if we conſider ſpiritually the diſcending of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, we ſhall find it as long as is the diſtance of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen from whence he came, vntill the Center of the earth whether he diſcended. And as there reſtes no other place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further to embaſe the ſonne of God, ſo would he not bée committed to more humilitie: only there remayned one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée which proceded of ſinne and the fellowſhip of Sathan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out of the which the perſon of Chriſt was exempted, hée which came to redéeme ſinners, and iuſtifie men, and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh the deuill. All that he could ſuffer to be made a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:2054:104"/>
for our ſinnes, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne of God was enclined &amp; embaſed vnto it, ſinne only except whereunto he could not be ſubiect for that there is too great enimitie betwene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iuſtice of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> malignity of ſinne. The greateſt part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> degrees aboue mencioned concerning the diſcending and humilitie of the ſonne of God, are declared by the Apoſtle, who ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by the ſuggeſtion of the holy Ghoſt, ſaith, that the ſonne of God being very God, was content to diſguiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe not to be entreated of the world as God, but embaſing his eſtate euen to take vppon him the forme of a bondman, and appeare to the world in the repreſentation of a man, becomming altogether a ſeruaunt whoſe obedience refuſed not the paſſions of death, yea the infamous execution of the croſſe. In this (as is ſayed) is expreſſed the greateſt part of this wonderfull embaſement of eſtate which the ſonne of God tooke vppon him, ſéeing of very God he is made very man, and being man he embaſed himſelfe vnder all men, being handled as a poore ſlaue of whom the world made no reckoning. From thence he ſuffred an other embaſement euen to be paſſed to condemnation of death, and not a death in common maner, but the execution whereunto were ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned diſhonour, infamie, and bitter torments: Of this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie the Prophets haue written ſaying, <hi>he was put on the ranke of offendors and accompanied with wicked men.</hi>

that the world miſknew him: For, much leſſe that he was acknowledged for Lord and maker of the world, ſéeing hée was not iudged worthy to dwell in the world: being inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, he hath bene condemned, and albeit his iuſtice and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie were publike and manifeſt, yet the world made no conſcience to throw vppon him thoſe great wronges: yea, being aſſuredly knowne htat his enemies accuſed him by faulſe teſtimonie, yet the wiſemen of the world would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther condemne iuſtice, then diſpleaſe the wicked.

                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 18.</note> and the ſcome of the people. There reſted yet one degrée, ſpoken of in this preſent article of the Créede, wherein we confeſſe that the ſonne of God diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into hell after his death: And touching the declaration of this laſt diſcending, we haue to conſider that this article may be vnderſtanded in two ſorts, they both being certaine, catholique, and ful of great miſteries. The firſt intelligence hath bene alreadie begone to be declared, and containes a demonſtration of the great humilite and wonderfull em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſement ſupported by the ſonne of God in this world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reduced to the vtter extremities of ſorrowe, torments, ſhame, and infamie. There is no ſpirit ſufficient to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend fully the great ſorow expreſſed by the Lord in theſe words <hi>my ſoule is heauie euen vnto death:</hi> The feare and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines being ſo much the more apparant, great, &amp; terrible, by how much they enforced drops of bloud to fall from his face euen to the earth.<note place="margin">Pſal. 68.</note> All the other Paſſions wherewith the world vexed him were of no meaner effect, and therfore complayning to his father he cried <hi>Oh ſaue me Lord</hi> for the waters and broyles of the tempeſt are entred, euen to take away my life. I am ſunke in a gulfe of myer and can find no place firme to fix my foote vppon: Wherein is ment no other thing but the ſtorme and furie of our ſinnes with the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:2054:105"/>
puniſhments due, together with a ſignification of all our miſeries, and that which the Deuill and the world could doo by the meane of the vnrighteous and wicked keping warre againſt our Sauiour with perſecutions, torments and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations. In this ſort was his diſcending into the deapth and bottome of the earth, and by conſequence the firſt intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of our Article, which, together with all that depends vppon it, may be proued by the ſecond vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding which muſt preſuppoſe that ſuch as afore the comming of Chriſt were dead in his fayth and in his ſpirit and knowledge, had obtayned pardon and were truly reconciled with God, notwithſtanding the gates of heauen were not open to them vntill the Lorde which deliuered them had paſſed therein as the onely iuſtifier and true pacifier</p>
               <p>In the meane whyle they remayned in reſt in a place na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Hell or bottome of the earth exſpecting their deliuerie when the ſonne of God ſhould come to draw them from thence: But all this whyle they were neyther in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of the Damned, and much leſſe endured their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metes neyther had the Deuill any iuriſdiction of them: Séeing, if they had bene of the reprobate and Damned ſort, the Deuill had had perpetuall power ouer them, as he hath had and hath ouer the Curſed and miſerable who die wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance of their ſinnes, and without participating in the benefit of the bloud of the Sonne of God. And for that by the occaſion of ſinne and reigne of the Deuill, the gates of heauen were cloaſed, and the ioy and vſe of beatitude ſtood reſtreyned and limited to a certaine time, I ſay that that place was a priſon and the priſon of Hell, a place wherein the Fathers of fayth exſpected the comming of the Sauiour of the worlde.</p>
               <p>In this place then were the auncientes that were iuſt, not that they felt the tormentes of the Damned, but had onely a careful deſire to ſée the propheſies accompliſhed and
<pb facs="tcp:2054:106"/>
themſelues deliuered, and al to enioy the preſence and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of the Sauiour together wyth that moſt happie viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the maieſtie of God. So that in this ſort did the ſoule of Ieſus Chriſt diſcende into that place accompanied wyth his diuinitie which neuer forſooke him, and diſſoluing the priſons, he brake in péeces all the Cheines and Linkes, that helde tyed the ſoules of the faythfull. This was it that <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi> the Prophet ment, when he ſayd that by the vertue of the bloud of thy ſtomacke and of thy Teſtament thou haſt drawen thy priſoners out of the Lake wyth out Water. Wherein the Prophete ſpeaketh euen wyth the Sonne of God, as true God and Sauiour of men, and foreſéeing ſuch great miſerie, he ſayth that by the vertue of his bloud wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conſiſted the Saluation of men, he had drawen his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes and frendes out of their darke priſon which he ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth by the Lake wythout Water: Séeing that in ſuch lyke places Conquerors are woont to beſtow their Priſoners for their more puniſhement and better ſecuritie in priſon: By the ſame alſo the Prophete takes the compariſon of a great Prince that entreth into the Lande of his enemie, not to ſhake his Sworde and remaine there, but to ſurmount and hauocke his enemie and take from him by force his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes and Subiectes whom of long time he had holden Priſoners. By this is ſhewed the great power of Ieſus Chriſt according to his owne phraſe in theſe tearmes: So long as a ſtrong man (ſayth he) and well furniſhed wyth weapons, kepes his houſe and defendes it by force, all that he hath is in peace. But if there come one more mightie then he, he makes him forſake his garde, chaſeth him out of his houſe, and becomes Lord of al his goods: euen ſo did our Lord with the Deuill, expreſſing vppon him his wonderful power, and great victory which he obtayned againſt the kingdome of darknes: For, ſéeing the Deuill hath layed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide his weapons, it is a ſigne he is vanquiſhed, and ſéeing death is conquered, the Deuill muſt néedes remayne diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſhed
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:2054:106"/>
of Armes: And ſéeing the depthes and bottomes of the earth haue bene illuminated by the light and preſence of our ſauiour, the kingdome of darkeneſſe is defeyted and brought to ruine. And ſo for concluſion we find thrée great conſiderations in the firſt part of this Article: Wherof the firſt hath ben debated, comprehending the great diſcending and extreame humilitie which the Sonne of God tooke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him to ſaue man and confound the works of ſinne. The ſecond conſiſts in this, that whileſt his moſt holy body acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with his diuinitie, remayned in the graue to teſtifie that he was truly dead: His ſoule diſcended into the darke priſons, where were deteined the holy fathers notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they were not in the power of the deuill. For albeit they were iuſtified by the vertue of the mediator and their fayth and repentance, yet they were baniſhed from heauen and put as it were in priſon, to witneſſe the effect and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ſinne, together wyth the neceſſitie which man had of the comming of the ſonne of God to geue them their full remedie. So that the ſauiour of the worlde entering into this priſon and confounding all darkeneſſe by his great light, did fully comfort and ſatiſfye by his preſence, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoules which exſpected him wyth a deſire farre aboue the iudgement or comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cion of man: it was then that thoſe good auncient Fathers ſaw the accompliſhment of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe long afore made to them, that out of their ſéede ſhould ryſe one that ſhould breake the heade of the great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. Then all their deſires were accompliſhed,<note place="margin">The viſion and conſolation of the auncient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding euen wyth their eyes the maieſtie and preſence of him, whom ſo often they had ſéene in contemplation and Spirite: In whom they had layde vppe all their hope, from the remembrance of whom they dyd neuer ſwarue, and by the onely thought of whom they had ouercome all their aduerſities, taking comfort in him in their miſeries and perplexities. Then did <hi>Abraham</hi> ſée him who was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to bleſſe al his people and al Nations, in the faith of
<pb facs="tcp:2054:107"/>
whom he was circumciſed, and made alliance with God. <hi>Jſaac</hi> ſaw him whom he prefigured when his father thought to haue ſacrifiſed him: he ſaw the ſprinkles and markes of the bloud, whoſe effuſion was moſt ſwéete before the face of the father from the beginning of the world. <hi>Jacob</hi> who had called vpon this ſauiour in his death, ſaw his deſiers fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, no more reſting which he might require. <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> ſaw the great ſacreficator, the ſacrifice of whom had neither end nor rule. <hi>Moiſes</hi> ſpake then with the great Prophet which God promiſed to ſend to deliuer his people from the captiuity of the ſpirituall Egipt, whoſe power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſhould be ſo perentory and great, that who would not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him, ſhould dye eternall death. And the great Prophete Dauid embraced then the health which hee had ſo long deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: he ſaw then that great and mighty Chriſt of whom hée had made ſo many holy ditties and ſonges, &amp; in whoſe hope he had ſo many times taken comfort and vanquiſhed ſinne. Laſtly, all the iuſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> times paſt, ſaw the accompliſhment of their deſiers, the end of their ſighes, the remedye of their miſeries, the comfort of their ſorowes, &amp; the victory againſte death, hell, and ſinne, and all by the preſence of the captaine which came to guide them euen vnto the ſight and maieſtie of GOD. Oh how poſſible are the perplexities which men ſuffer vnder hope of the promiſes of GOD: How hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie is that abiding or expectation, which for pawne hath the verity of GOD? Howe well aſſured and well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced is that patience which is of longe ſufferance and neuer ſwarueth? All theſe auncient Fathers were in diuers ſeaſons, and yet they had all one faith, they were all inſpired with one ſpirite, all ſerued one Lorde, all liued and dyed in one hope: they all bare their croſſe in this lyfe: they all were made priſoners in that place: laſtely they all ſaw in one inſtant him whom they had ſo long expected, together with the fulfillinge of al the promiſes which had ben made to them. There the Sauiour of the worlde ſpake
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:2054:107"/>
to them, publiſhinge good newes touchinge their reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes and reſtitution: And comunicated with them the great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of the miſteries which it behooued him to doe for their Redemption: there is no doubt but with them he vſed moſt deare familiaritie: Yea he who was alwaies ſo ioyfull with his owne, vſed no leſſe fauour and conſolation to thoſe with whom his Father had made alliance, and ſo iuſtely kept his promiſes. And they likewiſe rendred no ſmall thankes and praiſes to the Lorde that had ſo accompliſhed his worde for the Saluation of the world, yea, they departed out of their olde priſons with no ſmall triumphes, to follow their captaine which had ouer come ſo many and greate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</p>
               <p>The third conſideration is, that our ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt did not only breake the priſones and deliuer the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but alſo by this diſcending, hée brought a great aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and feare into hell and ouer the whole kingdome of the deuill, making him know that his forces were diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and that now was brought to effect the breaking of his head expreſſed long before by propheſie: and that the gates of his darke kingdome were throwne open, and all hys workes brought to nought. Euen as a captaine victor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into the fortreſſe of his ennemie, and hauing once pluckte downe the munition and enſignes, ſo committes it to ruine and ſpoile, that he leaues an eaſines to ſubdue it as often as he will: euen in the ſame ſort the Sunne of God gaue ſuch a terrour to the kingdome of hell: that ſathan and his miniſters knew well, their forces were broken, &amp; that there remained vnto them no poſſibilitie eftſones to reeſtabliſh a kingdome of ſufficient power to reſiſt the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ſouldier of that great captain, &amp; that hereafter he could take no priſoners except ſome wretched cowardes &amp; people of ſmal valure, which would offer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be captiues of their proper and miſerable will. In this ſort the princy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palitie of hell ſo felte the inuincible and aſſured power
<pb facs="tcp:2054:108"/>
of him, who being dead and his body left in the Sepulcher ſhaked them notwythſtanding with ſo great Warre, that on the one ſyde he leuyed thoſe Priſoners that were kept reſtrayned, and on the other, his vertue ſo weakened their infernall forces that they remeyned euer ſince van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed. It was then that they ſawe and knew that their Hell, whither they thought to haue reduced all mankinde, was forced and diſſolued: And that ſinne which they had introduced into the worlde and death that enſued it, were deade and vanquiſhed by the conqueſt of this newe and inuincible Prince. That was it which the Apoſtle ſpake of, that the ſonne of God hath defaced and ſacked the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Hell the worlde am putting them to publyke confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and Triumphing ouer them in his proper perſon: So that the enterpriſes of our Sauiour in this compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, repreſent vnto vs the forme and actions of a valiant Capteyne marching before men, before Aungelles, and before the face of the Father, wyth a great troupe of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies vanquiſhed, bounde, and ſpoyled of their forces.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of this Article wée touched that our Lorde made his diſcending by certeyne degrées: yea, euen to a Wonderfull embaſement of himſelfe, and knowne onely to the diuine wiſedome. This embaſement hath ben Prophecied vnder the ſigne of diſcending from Heauen vnto the the Bottomes of the Earth, But now we ſay that of all thoſe degrées by the which he diſcended, and of al other things which in the wiſedome of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world made him ſéeme ſo embaſed &amp; vanquiſhed, he caried a wonderfull vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory which encreaſed alwais more &amp; more. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt degrée he was made man, that was the true and eternall ſonne of God. This ſtep and wonderfull humilitie albeit it is great: yet he neuer abandoned his diuinitie, no, he could not loaſe it, and much leſſe diminiſhe it: by it his humanitie was greatly exalted, being by the ſame meane ſo connexed with the diuinitie, that one ſelfe perſon was GOD and man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:2054:108"/>
if it were poſſible y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God might gaine in any thing, it might be ſayd that he gained in this, but hauing want of nothing,<note place="margin">God hath no neceſſitie of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing.</note> he gaines not as a néedie man: For, he hath no neceſſitie of any thing, and much leſſe can there be added to his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. But becauſe the gaine of men is great in this,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.</note> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a benefite which was neuer Communicated with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelles (for God neuer tooke aliance nor ſéede of Aungelles but chuſed the Linage of <hi>Abraham</hi>) we ſay alſo that there was a gaine and profite to God, béeing a true declaration of his riches, and of his workes which are comformable to him together wyth a playne manifeſtation of his mercie. This victorie againſt ſinne and the deuill is truly worthie of the perſon of the Sonne of God: Séeing that mankinde which was put to perdition by the ſuttletie of the Serpent, is redéemed and redeliuered from the ſeruitude of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and reſtored to an eſtate of habilitie to be the Children of God, by the meane of this ſauiour. The ſeconde degrée of this diſcending of the Lord, was in that he was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned publykly as a malefactor. In this deſcending there is a great want, and yet by it he recouered a wonderfull vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie: For, béeing our brother he deliuereth vs from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall condemnation, ſo that all our libertie and abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion depende vppon his Condemnation:<note place="margin">Our abſolution depends vppon the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt.</note> he hath payde the debtes which he made not, euen ſo thoſe ſhall be diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged which ought them. He was Condemned by the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of men, and wée abſolued in the iudgement of God, hauing deliuered vs from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> curſſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law which had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned vs, The thirde degrée was when he was iudged to the Death of the Croſſe: For, by his death he brake the forces of Death, diſpoyling him of his weapons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyth he had made ſo great and vniuerſall ſlaughters: For which cauſe the Apoſtle demaundes of death where was his victorie, and where were become the meanes by the which he determined ſo many men?</p>
               <p>By the fourth ſteppe or degrée he was put into the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher,
<pb facs="tcp:2054:109"/>
but the better to comprehend the true ſenſe of this paſſage, it is méete we make ſome iudgment and conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thinges. The ſtorye of the Goſpell declareth that our Lorde being dead, <hi>Joſeph</hi> demaunded of <hi>Pylate</hi> to take his bodie from the croſſe and burie it, which <hi>Pylate</hi> ſuffered by the ordinance of God. And hauing taken it from the croſſe, they wrapped it in a newe Linnen cloath, and layde it in a Sepulcher where no man had yet lyen. Laſtly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing embawmed him wyth the oyntmentes which <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi> brought, they left the body in the graue, roulling to the mouth therof a great ſtoan: (<hi>Mary Nagdalin</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Mary</hi> conſidering well in their vnderſtanding the ſayd ſepulcher.) All this ſerueth to two effectes: the firſt is to render teſtimony of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth of the death of Ieſus Chriſt, ſhewing alſo a great miſterie comprehended vnder the graue: but the Church comprehendes both the one and the other in one worde, his Sepulcher: and that he remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned there thrée dayes expreſſeth the truth of his death, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by that meane his reſurrection more euident. In this Article the imbaſement and humilitie of the ſonne of God encreaſeth more and more, as alſo his ſpirite and victorie which he hath obteined for vs. For, it is ſayd firſt of al that he ſuffered the condemnation of <hi>Pilate,</hi> and was executed, and ſo being dead, his body was buried. It ſéemes that all theſe bring encreaſe to the victory of the deuill, the world, and death: But of the contrarie, it is our victory that is enlarged. For, by how much nere doth approch and is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted the death of our Lorde, by ſo much more is at hand the end and ruine of our death. Death is dead, and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed in ſuch ſort that he hath no power agaynſt vs, and for ſuch one we put him into the graue. <hi>Eſay</hi> hath Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied that the Lord ſhould deſtroy death eternally, and drye vp the teares of his people, and take away the diſhonor of the earth, in which words may be diſcerned the full victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry againſt death, which hath no power to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d nor make
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:2054:109"/>
ſorowful the true Chriſtian. It is not ſayd by this that we ſhall not die, and not féele death which is naturall: but by this is expounded that the pricks and ſorrows of death are vanquiſhed, &amp; haue no authority againſt a Chriſtian, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that for the exchange of this temporall lyfe, he goeth to the eternall life, accompanied with the fayth that he hath had that Chriſt is his redemption &amp; his life.

                  <p>Our Lorde béeing thus put into the graue and embaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, Soldiours were ſet to garde the Sepulcher: And in the meane whyle his Diſciples remayned ſorrowfull and heauie, hauing very little hope of his Reſurreciton, and ſmall knowledge of the ſcriptures to the vnderſtanding of this miſterie. They beleued that their maiſter had preached the trueth, and that he was moſt iuſt in his workes, and that God had ſent him: But touching the matter of reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, they were very blind and doubtfull.</p>
                  <p>After there was time enough perfourmed for the proofe, fayth, and teſtimonie of his paineful death, and to eſtabliſh the accompliſhement of the miſteries and propheſies. The Sunday morning, bringing wyth him the triumphes of hell and death, he Roaſe againe and returned to lyfe, and to ſuch a lyfe that after that, death had no more power ouer it, béeing defaced &amp; deueſted of all meanes eftſoones to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his iuriſdiction.</p>
                  <p>Imediatly after he was riſen agayne, he appeared to his Diſciples, to aſſure them of the conſolations giuen vnto them before he dyed, and wythal to accompliſhe the words ſpoken and promiſed by him, <hi>That he would riſe againe the third day.</hi> The firſt perſon to whom he reuealed himſelfe after his reſurrection, was the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> his Moother, as who aboue all others liued in moſt expectation for him, and he lykewiſe bare vnto her a moſt deare affection: For, if we conſider her by her fayth, ſhe had it more great then al the reſt: And if wée haue regarde to Seruices, ſhe merited wyth the beſt, hauing nouriſhed him &amp; followed him wyth no ſmall care, pouertie, and perplexitie thirtie thrée yeares. In her is expreſſed a good Teſtimonie of his death: for that ſtanding at the foote of the Croſſe, where ſhe felt the accompliſhment of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> propheſie of <hi>Simeon, that the ſword of ſorrow ſhould pearce thorow her intralles</hi>: ſhe was choſen of the Father to ſerue in an eſtate of great excelencie: euen ſo

was ſhe accompliſhed wyth thoughtes and actions méeke for the ſeruice of ſuch a function. And albeit, both by her perſeuerance (béeing greater then the reſt that followed the Lord,) and that the trauelles of his Death were of more Paſſion to her then to others, hauing more intereſt firſt of that holy companie to whome he diſcloſed his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection: Yet the Euangeliſtes aſcrybing nothing to the ſingularitie of perſones, leaue all that aparte, and recyte to whome he appeared wyth all ſuch circumſtances and proofes as ſerue for Teſtimonie agaynſt the People of the <hi>Jewes.</hi> He appeared to <hi>Mary Mardaline</hi> in forme of a Gardiner in the ſelfe ſame Gardeyne where he hadde béene Buried.

                  <p>And lyke as the Reſurrection of that <hi>Meſsias</hi> was of great importance, ſo alſo was it prefigured and foreſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the prophets that went afore: For, <hi>Jonas</hi> was throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en into the Sea, and ſwalowed of a <hi>Whale,</hi> and yet by the mercie of God after he had remained thrée dayes and thrée nights in the bellie of the Fiſh, he came out ſafe and ſound to accompliſhe the commaundement of God.

                     <hi>but ſpecially for that my fleſhe ſhall rest in hope. For, Lorde thou wilt not leaue my lyfe in the graue, nor ſuffer thy holy one to ſee corruption. Thou hast ſhewed me the way of lyfe, euen ſo ſhalt thou fill me wyth pleaſure by thy preſence: For, thou bearest in thy right hand a perpetual bliſse.</hi> In theſe wordes the Lord ſhew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth the ſinguler fauor which he receiued of his father, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death had not domination ouer him but was ſubdued and vanquiſhed, ſhewing withall the gladſome contentment he had to ſée the eternall Father on his right hand. In this hope he offered his body to the death, &amp; diſperſed it vpon the croſſe, &amp; receiued the graue, being certeine of his reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; victory, &amp; that aſwell touching himſelfe, as alſo for all mankind: wherin declaring alſo his confidence &amp; ioy of his victory, he ſayth that his Father hath not ſuffered that his lyfe ſhould remaine priſoner in the graue for euer, and much leſſe that his ſoule ſhould be there deteyned, &amp; not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne eftſoones to be revnited to his body. And laſtly that his moſt holy body conceiued by the holy Ghoſt in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> womb of the Virgin, and who had paſſed ſo many Paſſions of Tormentes for the Seruice and Obedience of his Father, ſhould not ſuffer corruption in the Graue, but afore Nature coulde accompliſhe that operation, his Soule ſhoulde eftſoones receaue coniuntion wyth his Bodye.

The Prophet ſayth moreouer that he hath ſhewed him the way to retorne to life: concluding with action of thankes, that he hath ſurmounted death and ſinne. The ſonne of God did not only obteyne priuilege to riſe againe, but alſo to him was ioyned power to make his reſurrection afore there was any ſuch ſigne of corruption in his body as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally appeares on others that be dead: this reſpect was kept on the behalfe of his moſt holy perſon, and the fleſh which he had taken for that effect, béeing pure and wihtout any marke of ſinne. Beſides all theſe, we may conſider vppon the end of this Pſalme a great miſterie of the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie which our Lord obtayned againſt death, together with the aſſurance of our reſurrection, the ſame leauing vs ſatiſfied and certayne that once againe we ſhall réenter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the poſſeſſion of our bodies, after wée haue abandoned them by the rigor of death.</p>
                  <p>With this Pſalme <hi>S.

This is of great importance for Chriſtians, to whom it is a true approbation and ſommarie of all the workes which the Lord did and of all our religion, together with an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red gage or pawne of all our hope.<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth that it is concluded &amp; the reſolution alreadie ſet downe againſt the aduerſaries and vnbeleuing, that Ieſus Chriſt is the

ſonne of God, the ſame being proued in this that the father hath rayſed him from the dead with a great force and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull teſtimonie, thereby to ſhew that he was his onely ſonne. Wherein on the one ſide might be ſéene the ſentence of men, the condemnation of the worlde, the reprobation of the people of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iniuries, outrages, and tormentes of the Croſſe and of death, which may alleage agaynſt the ſauiour of the worlde that he was not the Sonne of God but an abuſer: Séeing he was condemned by ſo great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, endured ſo many afflictions, yea, fixed on the croſſe in ſuch ſort and ſuch extremitie, that the miſerable worlde might eſtéeme him for ſuch one as of long time had bene Prophecied: that is, that he was not reputed a man as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were, but as one moſt abandoned of God and of all men. And on the other ſide might be ſéene the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies, workes and wordes of our Sauiour, and his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine expreſſing the reaſon of his comming, and the miſery of his death, together wyth the ſentence of his Father, who, to ſhew himſelfe true in his workes and promiſes, had rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him againe from death, declaring that he was his true ſonne. All theſe thinges béeing of ſuch importance were foretolde by Ieſus Chriſt afore his death, béeing willing to Propheſie and publiſhed his reſurrection both to his frendes and to his enmies, to comfort the one, and conuince the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Yea, he thought méete to manifeſt it to all, to make the worlde vnderſtande that he was ſent of the eternall Father to ſaue the worlde, and that it was he that had ben promiſed in the Law, offering himſelfe to death of his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and proper will. The <hi>Jewes</hi> demaunded of him ſome ſigne to know who he was, but he aunſwered that they ſhould haue no other ſigne but that of <hi>Jonas:</hi> For, as <hi>Jonas</hi> iſſued out of the bellie of the <hi>Whale</hi> the thirde day, So the thirde day after his death he ſhould eftſoones ryſe out of the center of the earth, hauing in that action vanquiſhed death.<note place="margin">Math. 2<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

By which he hath ſhewed that he came to vanquiſhe and ſurmount ſinne and death, and to pronounce, that as who ſo euer would followe him ſhould liue eternally, ſo to ſuch was reſerued euerlaſtinge death as would not obey his woorde and doctrine. For, in him ſaith he is conteined reſurrection and lyfe, yea and the Saluation of thoſe that beléeue in him.</p>
                  <p>To that to proue thoſe thinges, and to aſſure conſolation to all ſuch as ſhould giue faith to his woordes, it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, that he ſhould not only manifeſt himſelfe the author of lyfe in raiſing others, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> alſo he ſhould expreſſe it in his

                  <p>In effect we haue to conſider touching the vertue of the miſterie of the reſurrection, that he is alſo ſo riſen againe in vs Spirituallie: that if it be not long of our obſtinacie and Rebellion we ſhall féele the force of his Reſurrection in vs, that is, he will engender in vs a power and will to doe the workes worthie of a newe lyfe, and will make vs to riſe agayne to a newneſſe of lyfe, by the which we ſhalbe founde agréeable before the face of God: And béeing riſen wyth him we ſhall vanquiſhe death and ſinne, and be made frée from the ſeruitude of Sathan, being affected to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes of God, louers of his iuſtice, and zealous of his glory, to perticipate in the ende wyth the heauenly lyfe by the communion which we haue wyth the lyfe of Ieſus Chriſt in thoughts and workes: So that let all Chriſtians vnderſtande, that if in humilitie they ſearch a remedie for their ſinnes, opening wyth all the gate of their harte, they ſhall finde wyth in Ieſus Chriſt rayſed agayne: And that being in the companie of ſo great a Lorde liuing, who hath vanquiſhed death, they can not haue in them any deade thing: For, they ſhall alſo riſe againe ſpiritually wyth the Lorde into that newnes of lyfe whereof we haue ſpoken.

                  <p>In the third conſideratcon of this article the good chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian hath to vnderſtand, that in the reſurrection of the lord, we get not only ſpiritual reſurrection as hath ben ſaied, but alſo we haue aſſurance of the reſurrection of our bodies. So that, conſidering that Ieſus Chriſt is riſen from the dead for our welth and profit, we may be aſſured that he is riſen both in body and ſoul, &amp; that our reſurrection is no leſſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain then his riſing againe, being the aſſurance and gage of our reſurrection, and he being in all things our firſt borne &amp; captain, he marched before vs, and we muſt follow him. All the wretchednes that the deuill had cauſed, were repaired by the ſon of God: for, as the deuill threw ſpirituall death vp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pon mankind, ſo in the vertue of our ſauiour that death is deſtroyed &amp; vanquiſhed, and a life ſpiritual giuen vnto men. The deuil procured corporal death to mans race, (for death was brought into the world by ſinne) but the ſonne of God hath ioyned to vs a corporall reſurection. For, as death was introduced by a man, ſo by a man came reſtitution &amp; reſurrection: we were all dead in <hi>Adam,</hi> euen ſo are we al
<pb facs="tcp:2054:115"/>
reuiued and raiſed again in Jeſus Chriſt. This accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appertaines to the liberalitie of the dyuine maieſtie, which hath reeſtabliſhed and reſtored vs to the benefittes which he hath already communicated to vs: Our death is vanquiſhed on all partes, and on all ſides our life is eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons reeſtabliſhed. Wée are abſolued and made frée of all thinges, ſéeing we haue on our ſide the death and lyfe of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: the ſoueraigne bownty drawes vs from ſinne, the ſacrifice is offered, and we haue obtained pardon for our iniquities: being but poore &amp; wretched ſlaues we are made rich, and haue obteyned libertie to be the children of God. And if we looſe this benefitte, it is eyther for ſome newe falt of ours, or that wée will not caſt or chaunge our olde ſkinne. In effecte, in this Article is diſcloſed the great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and mercy of the Sonne of GOD, who refuſed not to go into the darke priſons of the Earthe, to deliuer the Soules of the iuſt there deteined, and diſpoile the Deuill of all his force and power, to the ende that men may with more eaſe vanquiſh and ſurmount him. We ſée alſo that after all this, he roſe againe the thirde day and returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to true lyfe, yea a life ſo excellent that death hath no more power ouer it, nor any poſſibilitie eftſoones to preiudice it. We haue ſhewed how this reſurrection hath ben ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently iuſtefied euen by the places of Scripture accordinge to the teſtimonye of the créede <hi>That Chriſt roſe againe the third day,</hi> accordinge to the Scriptures, which ſéemes to haue ben taken of the Apoſtle. Wée haue alſo declared how neceſſary was this reſurrection, for the approbation of the dignitie of the perſon and doctrine of Chriſte, ſéeing that in the ſame he is expreſſed the Sonne of GOD. Wee haue alſo debated how it is to be vnderſtanded and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed this great miſtery, partly for the regarde of our Lord, and partely for the reſurrection ſpirituall and corporall, which he workes in vs by vertue of his reſtitution. There remains nowe to declare who they be that practiſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentes
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:2054:115"/>
of this article in faith and workes: and who they bee that ſatiſfie it not. Such as profeſſe and practiſe the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ot this Article as appertaineth, are thoſe that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in the mortification of their ſinnes, their fleſhe, and their diſordered ſuggeſtions of the olde <hi>Adam,</hi> that they reduce and bring him euen to the graue, that is, that they make a full and perfecte victory of him, with a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe in themſelues, and a reſolute hatred to all wicked and ill actions: returning by the ſame meane into a new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of lyfe, new deſiers, and new operations and actions: Béeinge laſtly altogether conformable to that neweneſſe which the Sonne of God is wont to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municat with ſuche as are riſen againe with him. Thoſe be they that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie our Sauiour: For, as he is riſen againe to be neuer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter made ſubiect to death: ſo the faithfull riſen againe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, féele themſelues ſo conuerted and out of taſte of the woorkes of ſinne, that the ſpiritual death can not pearce ſo déepe as their hart. And as our Lord roſe againe trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing, ſo ſhall they alſo haue a glorious reſtitution, beinge repurged of all wicked affections and enclyned to all good thinges, to whom the yoke of the goſpell ſhall ſéeme eaſie and ſwéete, and ſhall trauell in great thirſte and appetite to obſerue the comaundementes of GOD. Their charitie ſhall enflame, their patience prepared to ſuffer all paines and tribulations: they are glorified in the glorie of Ieſus CHRIST, they haue an honeſtie and purity of conſcience, they are chaſte, they loue their neighbour perfectly, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don with all their harte ſuche as doe offend them. They retire themſelues from the thinges of this worlde, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon the pompes and ambitions of the ſame, as though they were vnapte therevnto, and had no mindes affected to ſuch tranſitory vanities. For, they are made newe men, reſtored and raiſed againe by the Sonne of God, who hath triumphed both ouer death and all dead thinges: And ſo are they made his that hath raiſed them, to ſerue him with new
<pb facs="tcp:2054:116"/>
fruites which their new life bringes forth. They feare not to ſuffer death to maintaine that which God hath ordeined: they care neither for reproche nor hunger to defend iuſtice &amp; truth: For their new life kepes them from ſmelling of thoſe thinges which might hinder their faith, perſeuerance, and conſtancie of hart in the traine of the goſpell, and ioynes vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to them a certainty of a better life which aſſureth them of all thinges.</p>
                  <p>Of the contrary, ſuch as be eſtraunged from this practiſe haue no other thinge but the ſimple name of thoſe that are raiſed againe. They are as painted ſepulchers ſet out to the ſhow without, and within conteine nothing but rottennes and corruption: ſuch were the Pharaſies with whom they haue only the title of lyfe and liuely, and in effect are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els then dead, rotten, and corrupte Reteyninge that ſtinke and loathſomnes which is wonte to be aboute dead bodies. Such be many of our chriſtians, who vnder thys name, hyde a pride and arrogancie which the deuil teacheth them, inſtructing them withall to be couetous and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, the more to make them ſauour of their ſtinke and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyneſſe. Laſtly thoſe be they that haue not chaunged nor caſt their ſkinne, and who being not mortefied, can not be raiſed again. For, reſurrection preſuppoſeth death, as there can be no death but there muſte firſt be a life, wherewith I ende the expoſition of this article, yéeldinge thankes for all thinges to GOD, whom I beſéech to continue his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in that proportion of faith which he thinkes neceſſary to their ſaluation.</p>

               <p>The vertue of chriſtian religion is ſo great, the miracles that haue confirmed it haue ben ſo publike and euident, and the innocencie &amp; holynes of lyfe of ſuch as haue profeſſed it, haue bin ſo cleare and manifeſt: that the very enemies haue bin driuen to beare teſtimony with it, notwithſtandinge that they impugned it with all their induſtrie.

wée may remaine abſolued, and they condemned.</p>
               <p>The firſte teſtimony I will produce ſhalbe <hi>Tertulian</hi> a writer in the time of the primatiue church, a man of greate knowledge maintayning the cauſe of the Chriſtians againſt the <hi>Pagans,</hi> and pleading and writinge publykely on the chriſtians ſide. And hauing (as it were) but ſipped and taſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of chriſtianity Hee had more fully ſurfeyted of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> faith to whom he bare a reſolute zeale: hee was in the times of the Emperours <hi>Seuerus</hi> and <hi>Caracalla,</hi> being about two hundred thrée ſcore and ten yeares after the death of Chriſt. All the argumentes which he inferreth againſt the <hi>Pagans,</hi> he deriueth from their proper hiſtoryes, and of thinges that were done in that tyme, ſhowing the reaſon why Chriſt was not worſhipped at Rome. The <hi>Romaines</hi> had this cuſtome, not to <hi>Canonize</hi> any newe God (although the Emperour woulde haue it ſo) without the approbation and conſent of the Senate, the ſame well appearinge in all the <hi>Romaine</hi> Edictes and hiſtories, wherein is defended to receiue any Straunge GOD wythout the authoritie of the Senate, and that by reaſon of the great inconuenyen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces happening by the lybertie that euerie one tooke to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troniſe himſelfe with one GOD a part, as may be ſéene in the times of the <hi>Bachanales</hi> and other ſeaſons.</p>
               <p>It happened that <hi>Pilat</hi> who had giuen ſentence of death againſt Chriſt, notwithſtanding he was ſtubburne in hys opinion, yet being conuinced both by his conſcience, and the certainty he had of the reſtitution of him whom he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to death: Aduertiſed <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperour of all that had paſſed, touchinge the death and reſurrection of our Lorde. The Emperour, obſeruing with this report, the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and great renoune that went of his paſſion, wrote to the Senate, that it were good to canonize Ieſus Chriſte for a God: But the Senate, whether it was for that they were not called to the firſt conſult of this matter: or that they would not make thinges ſo eaſie to the Emperour,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:2054:117"/>
ſpecially in a caſe of ſo great importance, fearing it woulde growe to example and conſequence, helde opinion contrary to the Emperour, and would not ſuffer that <hi>CHRISTE</hi> ſhould be worſhipped as GOD. Whervpon the Emperour publiſhed an Edicte againſte ſuch as woulde accuſe chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the deuill hauinge then ſtirred vp the Iewes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilles to perſecute thoſe that had receiued the goſpell, by which it came to paſſe that in the time of <hi>Tiberius</hi> the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian church was ſomwhat in reſt the goſpell fructifiinge greatly amongeſt the gentiles. Thus much for <hi>Tertulian,</hi> who durſte not haue written ſo in his time, if thinges had paſſed otherwayes: For, then was <hi>Rome</hi> in her eſtate, and ſtatutes of the Senate were diligently preſerued by regiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, where vnto <hi>Tertulian</hi> ſendes the gentiles, referringe them to their proper actes and ordinaunces, wherein they may finde that the firſt perſecution againſte the chriſtians was in the raigne of <hi>Nero</hi>: In all theſe are miniſtred many thinges of conſideration, declaring that the affaires of the goſpell haue bene managed by a ſpecial prouidence of God: For firſte, GOD ſo wrought that Poncius <hi>Pilate</hi> who had paſſed CHRIST to execution, bare witneſſe to his Father of the greatneſſe of him whom he had condemned: Secondly the lawes of the Senate and contention that was betwéen the Emperour and the magiſtrates, make good fayth and proofe, that the refuſing to canonize chriſt at <hi>Rome,</hi> was not by any default that was founde in him, but by reaſon of the vaine ordinances obſerued there, by the libertie of which they had power to accept for GODS ſuch as they woulde, and reiecte whom they helde not acceptable. Beſides, the greate prouidence of GOD is knowne in this, that the diuinitie of Ieſus Chriſte being ſufficiently iuſtefied as wel by his workes as by hys holy doctrine, yea by the teſtymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes of his enemyes: yet he would not ſuffer him to receiue this diſhonour to be accepted of the people of <hi>Rome</hi> for god, and much leſſe to be compared and placed amongeſt theyr
<pb facs="tcp:2054:118"/>
falſe gods whom they worſhipped, he which was true God, and had preached that there was but one God, and that al others were nothing els but abuſers and ſpirites of the Deuill. This prouidence alſo ſhewed it ſelfe great in this, that albeit the Emperour was no chriſtian, yet he forbad vppon great paines to trouble, perſecute, or to accuſe the chriſtians: the ſame being the cauſe that the goſpell was publiſhed in his firſt age, and that the gentilles and <hi>Pagans</hi> gaue eare to it: to the end that when the great perſecutions ſhould happen, the church might be found to haue ſome foun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dation, and certaine troupes of chriſtians vnited by the holy word of the goſpell. And therefore we haue to conclude, that all theſe things and accidentes haue ben guided &amp; gouerned by the wiſedome of God, ſéeing they ſerue to the approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſo high a miſtery. For our ſeconde teſtimony we will vſe <hi>Plutarke,</hi> a <hi>Pagan</hi> borne and of no ſmall authoritie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and at no time well diſpoſed to the chriſtians. He thinking to ſet downe a reaſon why the Oracles of the gentilles had taken ende, aledging many thinges according to his blindnes, and without any knowledge in the affaires of God, recites an hiſtorie by the relation of a frende of his of no ſmall authoritie and knowledge as is ſuggeſted. To this was referred ſo much the more ſtabilitie of faith and credit, by howe muche he makes it to happen in hys time.</p>
               <p>He ſaith that ſailing into <hi>Italy,</hi> and being in a ſhippe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with his ſaid frend and many others, about the euening they fel with the coaſt of certain Ilandes now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Cuzolares</hi> confining vppon <hi>Italy,</hi> There the winde failed them, and by that neceſſitie were driuen to go on ſhoare in one of thoſe Ilandes called <hi>Paff<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:2054:118"/>
ſuffiſinge to ſee him a Captaine and Gouernour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. This voice calling him thrée tymes, he aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered but to the thirde, aſ kinge what it would: to whom the voyce replyed aloude in theſe wordes. <hi>O Tamus when thou ſhalt ariue at Salus (nere to the Jle of Corfu) tell them that their great God Pan is dead.</hi> All the Nauie fell into greate feare and trouble of minde with the ſounde of the voyce, and conſulting what was to be done, <hi>Tamus</hi> to whom was committed the confidence of the meſſage, reſolued, that if the winde ſerued, he would paſſe by the place aſſigned by the voyce without ſaying any thing, giuing no other credit to it then as a viſion or illuding ſuggeſtion, but if the winde ſayled, then he promiſed to performe the imbaſſage. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to which reſolution, the wynde abating, he was dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to reſt at anker euen in the ſame place. <hi>Tamus</hi> ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge vppon the vppermoſte hatches of the ſhippe, began to erye with a loude voyce <hi>The great God pan is dead.</hi> He had no ſooner ended his ſpéeche, but there were heard ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall lamentations, ſighes, ſorrowes, ſkrikinges, with ſtraunge and wonderfull voyces, and that in maruelous multitudes. This accident was forthwith caried to the knowledge of <hi>Tyberius</hi> the Emperour, who raiſed all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diligence to vnderſtand what might that GOD <hi>Pan</hi> be that they ſayde was dead, wherein the wiſemen and wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſardes of that time, aunſwered him according to their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions and vaine coniectures. This <hi>Pan</hi> was a God which the gentiles worſhipped, there being many other Gods of that name. And this happened about the time of the paſſion of Chriſt, as may be gathered by the yeares of the raigne of <hi>Tyberius</hi> the Emperour. In déed <hi>Pan</hi> in gréeke ſignifieth, al. Wherevpon many do gather that al this was ſpoken of the death of Ieſus Chriſt, true God and lord ouer al things. But becauſe the gentiles held <hi>Pan</hi> for a God, there is good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruency to take the death of this <hi>Pan</hi> for the ſpiritual death of the Prince of deuilles, for the deſtruction of his kingdom,
<pb facs="tcp:2054:119"/>
and the ruin of his errours by the which he hath kept in cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie all mankind. To this are conformable the noiſe and voyces of the ſpirites complayninge and lamentinge the ruin of their Prince and his ſpirituall death, being nowe made naked of the ſtrength and forces wherwith he oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and vexed mankind. The ſame author affirmes that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſame time one <hi>Demetrius</hi> paſſing by the yles <hi>Orca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> neare to England, was tolde that not long ſince, there was heard great whiſpering and howlings in the ayre, and many fearefull thinges ſéene, the wyſe men of thoſe Ilandes conſtruing thoſe prodigious things to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of ſome great god, which opinion hath ſome reference with the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other woonders. But theſe ſtrange ſights &amp; ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in the world, interpret in true teſtimony and iudgement the ſtrangnes of the death of our ſouiour Ieſus chriſt, and of the victories which he hath obtained, together with his trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant glory.</p>
               <p>The third teſtimony we may draw from <hi>Traian</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, a Prince <hi>Pagan,</hi> &amp; albeit much reſolued into pagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy &amp; a great perſecutor of the chriſtians: yet ſo qualified by the truth of the goſpel, that he was conſtrained to moderate his crueltie, though not ſo much as he ought, yet ſo farre as miniſtred eaſe to the godly. <hi>Plinius Secundus</hi> eſtabliſhed hys deputie in <hi>Aſia</hi> againſt the chriſtians, aduertiſeth the Empe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rour that he founde no other ill in the chriſtians, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they made certaine aſſemblies, not to erect any <hi>Monopolie,</hi> nor to commit theft, nor to vſe ribaldrie, nor practiſe deceit, not to deſier the goods of others, nor to execute any vylanus act: only the cauſe that they aſſembled together, was to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate in common and neceſſary actions: as to eate &amp; drinke together offring no hurt or preiudice to any That which hée found moſt wicked &amp; ill in them was, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were adicted to a certain ſuperſtiton, not declaring it, and ſo concluded that there was no ill in them. This was in the beginning of our chriſtian religion, &amp; yet in that time the profeſſors of it were
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:2054:119"/>
bitterly perſecuted. But notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dinge they were accuſed and ſuffred impoſition of great Crimes, yet when they came to the triall and proofe (no ſmall matter amongſt people <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi>) they were holden ſo guiltles, that euen their ennemies gaue teſtimony of their innocency (the Deuill notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding keping them ſo blinde, that they had no iudgement of that which they did, nor vnderſtood what they purſued, and much leſſe knew what they were whom they cauſed to die ſo cruelly.) <hi>Plinie</hi> fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not culpable in any thing except a certain ſuperſtition, and yet without an apparance of il: he eſtéemed it ſuperſtition to beléeue that one man dead on the croſſe was the ſauiour of all men, not conſidering further y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> groundes of this religion. The aſſemblies they made were chiefly to celebrate the ſacrament of the ſupper, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a greater miſtery then <hi>Plinie</hi> could finde out. But the Emperour hauing this aduertiſement from his deputy, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad ani more to enquire againſt chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, willing notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſtan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch of them as were attainted &amp; conuinced, ſhould be puniſhed &amp; corrected. <hi>Tertulian</hi> deriding this edict, exclaimes againſt it ſaying: oh ordenance confuſed &amp; fooliſh: he forbids inquiſition becauſe they be innocent, and yet leaues liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to chaſtiſe them as offendours, in one inſtant he pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith, and yet he is cruell: he confeſſeth innnocencie, and yet diſſembleth it: if he will puniſh them, why defendes hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation againſt them? And if hee will not haue them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired vpon, why doth he not abſolue them? There are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in euery Prouince prouoſtes to apprehende and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon théeues &amp; robbers: and euery one hath liberty to kill a publike enemie, and to execute ſuch as the lawe hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uict of treaſon: But alone touching the chriſtians, it is not ſuffred that they bee cifted as offendours, and yet is it lawefull that euery one accuſe them, as though they bee thinges different to cutte of any one as an offendour, or to preſent him as a malefactor: Wherein thys Edicte ſuffereth thys contraryetie, denyinge information
<pb facs="tcp:2054:120"/>
and enquirie againſt the chriſtians, and yet leaues libertie to puniſh them if they be found guiltie. For, if no man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme againſte a chriſtian, howe ſhall he be founde guiltie? And in caſe of information, what meane is there to accuſe him, and ſo conſequently to punniſhe him not findinge hym culpable of any thing. So that the Emperour would that they were puniſhed not as culpable, but only for that they were Chriſtians. In all which as may be diſcerned the teſtimony which the firſte Chriſtians had of theyr proper ennemyes, together with the ſimplycitie of the ſtatutes by whoſe meane they were perſecuted: Euen ſo in all theſe thinges is matter tending to the aduowing and iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our iueice.</p>
               <p>The Fourth teſtimonie wée may draw out of the doings of <hi>Adrian,</hi> a Prince <hi>Pagan</hi> and dieng in the ſame ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Who, vpon the viewe and conſideration of certain inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hitions deliuered to him in writing by <hi>Quadratus</hi> a Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Apoſtles, and <hi>Aristides</hi> a Philoſopher conuerted to chriſtianitie, diſpatched commiſſioners to his proconſull of <hi>Aſia,</hi> enioyning him not to moleſt the chriſtians, for that they are and beare the name of chriſtians. He had not ſure erected this Edict, had hee not bene well informed of the innocency and iuſtice of ſuch as followed chriſtian religion, and had ſome taſte by the doctrine of <hi>Quadratus</hi> and <hi>Aristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> of the reaſons appertaining to the miſtery of the goſpel. For he deuiſed to builde Temples dedicated to the ſeruice and woorſhipping of Chriſt, wherein his counſell reſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned hym, alleadginge that in that example woulde be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall conuerſion to chriſtianitie. In this may be diſcerned the conſcience of his councellours, who ſtoode vpon no other impediments, but a certain feare that by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> meane the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude would come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth. Thoſe te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples that he did build were not ſubect to idolatrie, neither would he ſuffer cuſtomes of ſuperſtition, beeing for thoſe reſpectes

called the temples of <hi>Adrian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marcus Antonius Aurelius,</hi> declared in fauour of the chriſtians, that they worſhipped the immortal God: he gaue libertie to whom would be a chriſtian, and forbad expreſſely that they ſhould be moleſted.</p>
               <p>The Emperour <hi>Alexander Seuerus</hi> publiſhed a lawe in grace of the chriſtians, that they ſhould not be perſecuted, and much leſſe reſtrained to vſe publike conference and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their religion: he had hanging in his Oratorie the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage <hi>of a Crucifix, and deuiſed to builde a Temple wherein Chriſt ſhould be worſhipped,</hi> but he ſuffered many impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes that drew him from it. All this was wrought by Gods prouidence, foreſéeing that the Sauiour of the worlde ſhoulde not be put amongſt other falſe Gods. This Prince in all his deuiſes and ſpéeches had great familiaritie wyth this principall point of chriſtian diſcipline. <hi>Not to do to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that which he would not haue done to himſelf:</hi> wherin was good declaration that his conſcience could not denie that truth which thoſe men profeſſed that were perſecuted of the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alerius Maximus</hi> the Emperour was a great vexer of the chriſtians, yet the truth of the goſpell, and the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of God which he had bitterly felt, made him often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times reuoke the ſtraight and ſeueare Edictes which he had ordeined againſt the chriſtians, giuinge libertie to who would profeſſe the ſtate and opinion of chriſtianitie, and they not to be vexed by any perſecutions. All theſe men and great Princes were ſworne ennemies to the religion, and died in their ignorance and blindnes, whoſe teſtimonies are of no ſmall effect againſt the ennemies of Chriſt. For, when they ceaſed to vexe and perſecute the church, and beare fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to the chriſtians, it procéeded of none other motion the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the puretie of religion, and of the iuſtice and innocencye of thoſe that profeſſed it, together with their conſtancie in all actes of vertue, bearing withal a ſetled hatred to all vices:
<pb facs="tcp:2054:121"/>
They ſaw alſo the ſundry maruelles and prodigious things which were don daily for the reformation of that doctrine, and felt the anger of GOD and his chaſtiſementes thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered vppon ſuch as perſecuted the churche. So that it ſéemes that in thoſe thinges was a ſpirit enforcinge thoſe mightie Princes to teſtifie for that doctrine and beare fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to it, to the ende that on all ſides errour and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode might be driuen away, as béeing not hable to remaine where the lighte of the goſpell ſhould diſpearſe his beames. In that time when the goſpell began to be planted and ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and that the name of a chriſtian was ſo dearely ſolde to him that bare it: the prouidence of God raiſed a meane to remoue the croſſe from the churche, to the end ſhée were not ſo oppreſſed with perſecutions, as not to haue leaſure to recouer breath and eftſones take freſh courage. Thys reſpitte was giuen by the meanes to haue conuerſation with the <hi>Pagans,</hi> and yet remained from the Emperour <hi>Tiberius</hi> vntill <hi>Nero,</hi> who was the firſt that perſecuted the primatiue churche: yea this perſecution brought greate ſlaughter to the chriſtians, euen to the principalles of the church, and Chriſtes Diſciples, hauinge brought to perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion their race and courſe, and accompliſhed all thoſe thinges that appertained to their time, and for the which they had bene myraculouſly preſerued. The Emperour <hi>Domitian</hi> contynued this affliction, and by him notwyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandinge the goodneſſe of GOD wroughte a meane to ceaſe and remoue all thoſe tormentes, for that by the hate which <hi>Domitian</hi> boare to the doinges of his predeceſſour <hi>Nero,</hi> he with the Senate brake all the ſtatutes and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of <hi>Nero</hi>: By which was miniſtred to the churche good oportunitie to reenter into comforte and courage, bringinge ſome reſte to the goſpell, the better to haue it communicated in ſome ſewertie, and to plant it with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter power: So that in good viewe and conſideration of theſe affaires and actions, we may diſcerne in theſe diſcourſes
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:2054:121"/>
of the chriſtian church, a woonderfull fauour and prouidence of GOD, ſéekinge on the one ſide to proue and examine his churche by a rigorous croſſe, ſhewinge her the traces and ſteppes of her Sauiour, to the ende to followe hym: and on the other ſide, he exhibited a Fatherly loue and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible prouidence, making her truly to ſe, that nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther the furie of the kingdome of Sathan, nor the rage of his miniſters, are ſufficient to ſupplant and roote it out of the worlde: yea hauinge on her part the infinitte power of GOD, ſhe ſhall ſtande eternally, and yet the worlde not know the meane how ſhe is preſerued. By this meane alſo may bee diſcerned how readily and feruently the yre of GOD is kindled againſte the aduerſaries of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, ſéeinge that all the Romaine Emperours which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted it, ſuffered wicked and monſtrous endes: As of the contrary, ſuch as were moderate and temperate, founde fauour with GOD, and were leſſe punniſhed of the world, laying them in compariſon wyth <hi>Nero, Domitian</hi> and ſuch other like Princes whom the Deuill helde in hys deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to perſecute the churche. By theſe meaness the Pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue churche was mayntained ſometimes in one eſtate, ſometimes in an other, vntill the raigne of <hi>Julian</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtat, who being a chriſtian in hys beginninge, was ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by <hi>Libinius Sofista</hi> his ſchoolmaiſter to abandon Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith, and reſtore Paganry, together wyth the ſacrifices and ſuperſtitions which had bene aboliſhed by the lighte of the goſpell. By theſe it is woonderfull to ſee howe chriſtian faith encreaſed, ſéeinge the impedimentes of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution that were raiſed againſt it: But much more are to be woondered at the reſpytes, ſuccours, and comfortes which euen her proper ennemyes miniſtred vnto her, as well appeareth no leſſe by the relation of thoſe myghty Princes &amp; Emperours before declared, then alſo by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of this <hi>Iulian,</hi> in whom Gods prouidence wrought

no leſſe benefitte and fauour then in any of the reſt: ſéeing that notwithſtandinge this Prince perſecuted the church with greater arte and hate then any of his predeceſſours: yet God forbare not to raiſe her into an eſtate of great ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall proſperitie, this tirant ſéeing as well in his life as his death, euident tokens that God was his enemie. For, euen in his time the goſpell was preached and receyued by the greateſt part of the world, by which, the wiſedome and goodnes of God diſcloſed manifeſtly, that that which floated and floriſhed in deſpite of the induſtrie, crueltie and power of the worlde, was come from Heauen, from whence was miniſtred vnto it all fauour, ſuccour and ayde.</p>

So that Idolatry toke his beginning of infidelitie, and the
<pb facs="tcp:2054:123"/>
wicked inclinations of men, deliting leaue the right way &amp; to folow that that leades to perdition. To this was much helping the forgetfulneſſe of the trueth, and the negligence of men caring not to folow religion and doctrine and much leſſe to teach it to others. An other originall or fountaine ſpringes of the loue of our ſelues, called Selfeloue, together wyth an inſaciable will which men haue to put themſelues in libertie, inducing them faythfully to ſearche a thouſand waies for their ſatiſfaction, and by ſome meane to inuent abhominable Superſtitions, whervnto the deuill is ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to miniſter aſſiſtance wythall the art and fauor he can, that poore ſinners, to make them the more hardened and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate, fixing vpon certaine faulſe and deceitfull experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, attribute in the ende, dignitie to any thing of the which (according to their coniecture) they had receiued ayd or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. In other places, they haue a certaine feare in their conſciences which reſtraines them to demaund of God the things which themſelues eſtéeme to be wicked &amp; diſhoneſt. By that it comes to paſſe, that they are pleaſed with the ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uice of theſe faulſe gods, who care not but only to be ſerued as gods, wythout regarding whether the men be iuſt or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightful.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:2054:123"/>
and limit, &amp; that euery god had his perticuler eſtate to gouerne: Of which ſprang the firſt Idolatry, for ſome wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped the Sunne, with many other triffling and diſhoneſt things, &amp; others did worſhip to deuilles which abuſed them by illuſions &amp; oracles, yea ſomtimes by certaine aparances of remedies tending notwithſtanding to their ruine. This blindnes was ſuffered by the iuſtice of god to puniſh ſuch as leauing the light, run after darkneſſe, making themſelues iudges of their proper affections, &amp; ruled their hartes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame how good or euil ſo euer they were: in which reſpect god willing to puniſh thoſe vices &amp; exceſſes, ſuffered the deuill to raiſe faulſe ſignes &amp; miracles, euen to aduance the deſtruction of ſuch as fell into ſpoyle by their infidelitie and multitude of their tranſgreſſions.</p>
               <p>And albeit Idolatrie was great before the flud, and that the worlde purſued alwayes his firſt corruption, béeing ſtirred vp by the Deuill who induced men to a forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God: Yet, the mercie of God who had not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten his Promiſes made to mankinde, ſo prouyded for the effect of his Promiſe, that he chuſed a People par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to reeſtabliſh wyth him the trueth of his Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and alliaunces: To them he gaue a perfecte lyght to guyde them agaynſt thoſe Darkeneſſe and obſtinacies which the Deuil rayſed agaynſt them, he eſtabliſhed lawes and ordinaunces touching the Seruice of Religion, wyth expreſſe Commaundement that they obſerue them, and bée attentiue to the worde of God the better to arme them agaynſt the ſuttleties, ſuggeſtions, and illuſions of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. So that there is (no dout) but this people was choſen to be a grayne wherein ſhould be preſerued the puritie of the ſéede of the doctrine &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aſſurance of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mercy of god, ſeruing withal to declare how wonderfull God is in his works &amp; to remaine as a mirror to all natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to ſerue &amp; honor but one God, confounding al other Gods, as faulſe and of the deuil. In effect God ſaw good to continue the roote and ſtocke of
<pb facs="tcp:2054:124"/>
his truth to his people whom he had choſen, to the ende the worlde might know that he drue to him his people by other meanes then did the deuil, wyth whom it hath ben alwaies familiar to lay ſnares and ſuttle traps to intice the frayltie of men.<note place="margin">Abraham cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen chiefe of the people of God.</note> Ouer this people of god <hi>Abraham</hi> was choſen chiefe and leader, as afore him were appointed <hi>Seth</hi> and <hi>Noe.</hi> But <hi>Abraham</hi> being a <hi>Chalde,</hi> and lyuing amongeſt an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Nation, God ſawe good to make a choyſe of him and call him to himſelfe, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunding him to abandon his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and kindred, and go whether he would guide him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to make him great, yea, euen a mightie ruler ouer a large people. All this conteynes as yet nothing but miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the diuine wiſedome and of workes of iuſtice and mercie. For firſt, God chuſed for chieftayne of his people, a man who may ſerue for example to all poſterities ſuccée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him, for Fayth, Loue, Obedience, Truth, Iuſtice, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience, Charitie, knowledge of Sinne, and laſtly for all, whatſoeuer may concerne the Honour and glory of God, and his Seruice. He was called of God to Serue as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to his newe People, and all others, and in whome God would expreſſe wyth what fauour, ſupport, and ayde, he followeth thoſe that ſerue and honour him. To him all Princes and principall guides of people, ought to confyrme and referre their councels &amp; actions, for God loues ſuch as he as he was. But now to retourne to <hi>Abraham.</hi> God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded him to forſake his countrey and the Religion of the <hi>Chaldees</hi>: Wherein firſt of all he ſhewed how hatefull that people was to him for renouncing his worde, yea the more fully to Puniſhe them, he tooke from them the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of a Perſonage which had knowledge of this Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and frueth of his worde. This is it that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete meanes ſaying, <hi>Wee haue Ministred Medicines to Babylon and yet ſhee hath receiued no Cure, and after wee haue abandoned her euery one. &amp;c.</hi> Euenſo the obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the <hi>Chaldees</hi> agaynſt the Doctrine of <hi>Abraham</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:2054:124"/>
deſerued to bée forſaken as a thing abandoned of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>
               <p>Secondly it may be ſayd that <hi>Abraham</hi> was withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en from his Countrey, for that for the moſt part God bears vnto his ſuch proportion of fauor, that he withdrawes them from il companies, &amp; conſequently from the puniſhments and corrections which he holdes readie to thunder vpon the heades of the wicked. By that meane he drue <hi>Lot</hi> out of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and preſerued <hi>Helias</hi> in the time of famine, ſhewing in them the great care and ſpeciall prouidence he hath ouer thoſe that ſerue him. Thirdly in this euocation of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> is taught how néedeful it is to ſuch as ſéeke to be of the nomber of Gods People, to be deuided and drawne from vices, and that they fixe not vppon the abuſes of this world, ſéeing they ought to be a People ſeperate, and Subiect to no Communitie or traffyke wyth Sinners, and Idolators. For that cauſe the Scripture calleth the Children of God Baniſhed and ſeperate from all men. <hi>Eſay</hi> alſo Exhorteth the Faythfull to retyre from the Companie of the wicked, but ſpecialſy ſuche as are Gods Seruauntes and Sacrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators, ordeyued to accompliſhe the Statutes and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes of God. <hi>Abraham</hi> iſſued out of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the <hi>Chaldees</hi> vppon the aſſuraunce of Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to make him a guide &amp; leader of a mightie people, and wythall to purchaſe ſuch renoume and fauor, that who bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that people ſhould be bleſſed, &amp; who accurſed them ſhould partake with the ſame, and that out of his ſéed ſhould iſſue he that ſhould bring felicitie and bleſſing to all the nations and kinreds of the earth. This promiſe is a reuiuing of that which had béene made to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Heua,</hi> whereof the certayntie ſéemes to bée ſo much the more great, by how much God aſſigneth the Séede out of the which ſhould iſſue the <hi>Meſsias</hi> and Sauiour of the Worlde. By this may be conſidered the great rewarde that ſuch may hope for as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
<pb facs="tcp:2054:125"/>
the Lorde béeing called to the obedience of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, and are withdrawne from the delights and vanities of the worlde to followe bitter thinges, and of harde diſgeſtion. For as God ſheweth the fauor he beareth them chuſing them for his ſeruice and aduaunſing them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aboue all others: So doth he alſo expreſſe the perticular care he hath ouer his choſen, whom if he aduaunce on one behalfe, he doth alſo priueleadge on an other. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all thoſe promiſes, <hi>Abraham</hi> forbare not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure much, and to beare his Croſſe wyth much trouble, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing alwayes the eternall will to ſhew that the bountie and iuſtice of God are pefect in all his workes. And albeit he liued in great perplexitie and pouertie and ſuffered ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tribulations and perſecutions, yet God deliuered him, and made him proſper that he was riche, mightie and vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious ouer his enemies. This is the true Image of the way of God and truth, and to it God calles vs wyth milke and delytes, as nurſſes vſe to intice little Children, to the ende we know that all his wayes are founded vpon mercie and trueth, and that he is vpright in his worde to the iuſt, leauing vs to folow him by that way, &amp; obey him as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his will to be readie enclined to our health and benefite the ſame béeing the true ende and purpoſe for the which he hath choſen vs to ſerue his turne of vs.<note place="margin">Perſecutions are neceſſary for our felicities.</note> Touching the croſſe and perſecution which <hi>Abraham</hi> ſuffered, they weare neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarye to his felicitie. For God vſeth to proue our fayth, to ſhowe by effect what loue wée beare him, and what pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Charitie wée haue, ſhewing wythall how much the worlde is our enemie, declaring it ſelfe for ſuch one in all his actions, and that God onely hath created and redée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vs, and onely miniſtreth all fauour to vs, to the ende wée ſhould call him to our ayde in our neceſſities, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe him, whereby the remorce and féeling we haue of his
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:2054:125"/>
mercie may enflame vs to yéeld him thanks. And that our fayth béeing tryed by the fire of tribulation and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the vertue of our patience may encreaſe and our hope growe ſtronger dayly to reſiſte Sinne and the Worlde, vnder Aſſuraunce and Confydence of the Bowntie of God.</p>
               <p>So that <hi>Abraham</hi> a man iuſte was led in theſe Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes ſomtimes in glorie, and ſometimes in tribulation: by the Contemplation of whoſe lyfe, all Chriſtians may know how God handleth his choſen, and of what Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hée will chuſe them, and wyth what courage hée will haue them learne to worſhippe him. <hi>Abraham</hi> iſſuing out of the Lande of the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> Ledde wyth him <hi>Sara</hi> his Wyfe and <hi>Loth</hi> his Nephewe, together wyth all their Familie that was in <hi>Haram</hi> Inſtructed in the trueth of GOD according to the Reuelations that hadde béene made to their Predeceſſors. And from thence he went into the Region of <hi>Chanaan</hi> following the ordinaunce of God. The <hi>Chananites</hi> weare Idolators, and a Nation more Dedicated to Vices then any Clymatte of the worlde. By which meanes <hi>Abraham</hi> leauing one Countrey whoſe People weare nothing worth, was ledde into an other where the Inhabytauntes were worſſe, and all thys by the wyll and ordinaunce of GOD, whoſe Mercye doth in ſuche ſort Diſpoſe his Actions, that what hée takes from ſome by Iuſtice, hée géeues to others by hys mercie: In ſuche ſort that the Ende of his Woorks is alwayes good, although the wiſedome of the world eſtéeme it contrarie.</p>
               <p>This was one Singuler ill amongeſt other Wicked thinges whiche the <hi>Chaldees</hi> hadde, that béeinge Blyſſed wyth the Preſence and Induſtrye of a Vertuous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage, Preachinge and Teachinge them the Truethe:
<pb facs="tcp:2054:126"/>
yet they made no accompt of his Doctrine, but diſpiſed him and his aduertiſementes. And therefore God depriued them of that benefite whereof they had made themſelues vnworthie by the reſiſtaunce which they ſhewed agaynſt his worde.</p>
               <p>Touching the <hi>Cananits</hi> as they were the moſt wicked race of the Worlde, ſo they had not as yet the knowledge of the trueth: In which reſpect it pleaſed the goodneſſe of God to Communicate it to them by the meane of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whom he ledde into their Countrey: which benefite tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned afterwardes to their great condemnation, by reaſon of their reuoltes, ſtubburneſſe, and obſtinacie, by the which they prouoked the Ire of God againſt them. Of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the fayth and patience of <hi>Abraham</hi> was well proued amongſt this rebellious people the more to make him ſéeke his ſuccours in God, who had drawne him out of the Land of the <hi>Chaldees.</hi>

               <p>God had determined to giue the Lande of <hi>Chanaan</hi> to the people whom he had choſen in his preſence, ſhewing the greatneſſe of his mercie towardes ſuche as follow him, to whom he giues Lande &amp; Heritage. And of the contrarie, to ſhew his Ire agaynſt ſinners by the Puniſhement which he made of the <hi>Chananits</hi> &amp; other nations poſſeſſing the ſaid Lande. For this cauſe he willed that <hi>Abraham</hi> after the paſſion of many tribulations ſhould dye in that Lande, to confyrme to him his promiſe, and to impatronize him of that Region for and in the name of ſuche as ſhould diſcend of him. And long time after, yea, when it was impoſſible to men to occupie that Lande, he gaue that inheritaunce to the Children of Iſraell, to ſhew that he was iuſt and that his Promiſes were certaine. So that <hi>Abraham</hi> béeing at <hi>Sichem</hi> a Towne of <hi>Chanaan,</hi> God appeared to him and Promiſed to giue the ſayde Lande to his ſéed. There <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> builded an Aulter and dyd Sacrifyce, calling vpon the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:2054:126"/>
name of the Lorde: There he endured great Tribulations, in which was eſtabliſhed aſſured teſtimony of his faith and patience: and on the otherſide the Lordes goodnes was with him, deliuering him of his troubles, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated that which ſhould happen to his people, reuiuing the alliance made with him: he aſſured him that in his ſeede all nations ſhould receiue bliſſing, and promiſed that he ſhould haue a ſonne by <hi>Sara</hi> his wife being already aged. Thus the familie of <hi>Abraham</hi> multiplied fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one day to an other, which he gouerned by the preaching of the word, and all to entertaine them in the obſeruation of Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and in his feare: The Lord then made alliance with him aſwell in his owne name as for his ſucceſſors, con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayning theſe capitulations. Firſt that <hi>Abraham</hi> and his, for following his truth and the obedience of the ſame, ſhould bée his people, and hée would bée their GOD. That the ſéede of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould ſerue him and reappoſe their hope in his promiſes made to them. That they kéepe the Lawes which he calleth Iuſtice, which hée had geuen them. Laſtly that hée would bée their GOD, and protect and defend them in this world, and inſtruct them in the way to obtaine the life of the other world, pardoning all their ſinnes in fauour and conſideration of him which had bene promiſed for the redemption of man kind, and ordayned to ſurmount the forces of hell, and conquere the Deuill. In ſigne whereof hée ordayned that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould bée circumciſed together with all the male children diſcending of him and his whole familie, the ſame ſeruing as a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and perpetuall memorie of the alliance made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene GOD and them, and of the ſpirituall generation of the ſéede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whom GOD adopted for his children in the name of him that was promiſed, by meane of which adoption this ſpirituall people ſhould bée a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall enemie to the old Serpent and his workes. From
<pb facs="tcp:2054:127"/>
that time the people of GOD more obſerued outward ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies then they had done. For, beſides the ſacrifices which they made, they adioyned circumciſion, the ſame ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them as a marke to declare outwardly the profeſſion of their Religion, and that they ſhould worſhip the only God which had geuen creation, and had promiſed redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſinnes.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:2054:128"/>
the qualety of gouernemente of common weales and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that of the Churche, that being of many deſired, it is of few well exerciſed.

All theſe condicious may bée of one man deſired, but they are hardly fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to méete in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: For, to ſpeake in truth and libertie, there is no man ſo good, in whom is not ſome faulte to bée corrected, and many imperfections to bée remedied. And therefore for one man to call an other vertuous without flatterie, it is to giue him the greateſt title of the worlde, ſéeing it is found by experience, that the name of vertuous, is of many deſired, but of very fewe deſerued.</p>
               <p>It is not without ſorowe to good men to ſée many vaine and glorious mindes nowe a dayes delited to bée honoured vppon the ſuperſcription of Letters with theſe titles, moſt high, moſt mightie, moſt magnificall, or moſt reuerent, eſtéeming it to diſhonour if moſt vertuous bée put in, and leauing that title, not for a Noble man but for perſonages of meane eſtate.

is of many deſired, and not greatly deſerued. I aſſure you ſir) I am already ſo full with the trauell of gouernement and to be a Biſhop, that if as I haue determined it with reaſon, I could conclude it with opinion, I would with as good hart refuſe the charge, as others would accept it with gladnes: For that my naturall inclination beares more to ſéeke out the ſwéeteneſſe of Philoſophie, then to trauell in the bitter perplexities of pollicie. In this many will ſay I write againſt my ſelfe, for that ſuch vaine world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges as I am employe not our ſkill and ſtudie to ſearch onely mediocretie to liue by, but to gather ſuperfluities to ſerue our appetites, following not reaſon but opinion. And many doe I knowe in this world now a dayes, to whom of that little they haue there would yet remayne ſome thing, if they had none to content but themſelues: but their endes tending more to ſatiſfie that which their neighbours may ſaye, then to accompliſh thinges which they are bound to doe: neyther the inheritance of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, nor the vſe of their friendes can ſuffize their prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallitie. And therefore both troubleſome, daungerous, and chargefull is the eſtate of Princes and great Lordes.: For, that to get riches they are alone, but the deuiding and partition of the ſame is ſubiect to the will of many: Yea in that reſpect they are no other then trivutaries and ſubiectes, ſince that of all that they poſſeſſe, moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they haue the vſe but of the leaſt part. Wherein <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Aurelius</hi> writing to a deare friend of his, vſeth this diſcourſe. Many times it is agréeable enough that a man doe what hée would, but neuer is it lawfull to doe that hée ought not: For, to make warre againſt men, is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times glory, but to bée at controuerſie with reaſon is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes attributed to follie. There bée many men wiſe, but more bée fooles, and the greateſt foote of all is hée, who béeing at reſt in his houſe, ſearcheth with diligence elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, troubles, trauayles, and perplexities. For, that
<pb facs="tcp:2054:129"/>
for the moſt part hée reapes no other fruite of the offices and eſtates which hée ſearcheth abrode, then to ſuffer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually payne, care, and griefe at home: There is no doubt that to bée Emperour of <hi>Rome</hi> is not a greatnes aboue all the eſtates of the worlde. But waighing wyth his countenaunce and Maieſtie the cares and infelicities that are annexed to the ſeate, there is farre greater ſecuritie to followe a priuate lyfe, then to manage the affayres and trauayles of a Kyngdome. And becauſe (good <hi>Pution</hi>) thou art ſo neare mée in friendſhippe and opinion,<note place="margin">In aduerſities it is one comfort to knowe the vttermoſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap.</note> I will debate it franckly wyth thée, though not ſo much for that thou deſireſt to knowe it, yet becauſe it bringes eaſe to my harte to communicate my Fortune, as in all aduerſities it is one chiefe comfort when men knowe the vttermoſt of their miſhappes: But thus was the caſe.</p>
               <p>The Emperour <hi>Anthonius</hi> adopting mée to his Sonne in Lawe, gaue mée to wyfe his Daughter, and for a Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie endued mée wyth the Empire, two thinges very hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and euen ſo not a little troubleſome: For that to the gouernement of the Empire is tied great payne and trauayle, and in <hi>Faustine</hi> my wyfe is great difficultie of moderation and modeſtie. Herein thou haſt no reaſon to maruayle ſo much of that I write to thée now, as to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wyth what diſcretion I haue ſo long time ſuffered it, aſſuring thée, that the trauayles of the Kyngdome ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten my lyfe, and the libertie of my wyfe diminiſhed mine honour. For, ſhée béeing the Daughter of an Emperour, the wyfe of an Emperour, hauing with all the helpe of riches, beautie, and authoritie, ſhée forbeares not to vſe the priuilege of her libertie not as ſhée ought, but as ſhée liſt.</p>

And that which worſe is, ſhée will neuer ſuffer reformation
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:2054:129"/>
of this error, wythout the preiudice of myne honour. So, that in a fourme of lyfe as this is, and wyth the felowſhip of a Wyfe ſuch as is <hi>Faustine,</hi> it had bene better for mée to haue taken the ſtate of a labourer, then to haue bene rayſed to the place of the Empire. For that when the reckoninge is made, as there is no land ſo hard which the Plough doth not tourne vp, ſo there is no man ſo humble which will bée commaunded. I was neuer ſo well ſerued, as when I had but one Page, and now that I am Emperour, all men call mée ſeruauntes, and yet I am made ſeruaunt to them all. Wherein thou mayeſt ſée a lamentable difference betwéene that I was then, and the condicion I liue in nowe: For when I followed the ſtudie of Philoſophie I had contentment of minde, where the pompes of the Empire ſo carieth mée into ſtraunge ſpirites, that I haue forgot the vertue and Science I knew, and nowe am trauayled in infirmities which I can not auoide.</p>
               <p>When I was a priuate man, all men held their eyes fixed vppon mée, and now that I am a Prince, there are fewe that employe not their tongues againſt mée, the ſame wel approuing, that as in Princes there is alwayes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to bée warned, ſo in Subiectes are many thinges to bée corrected. All this (good <hi>Pution</hi>) I debate wyth thée, to the end, thou owe compaſſion to my eſtate paſt, and beare pitie to that I am nowe, hauing neyther time to communicate wyth thoſe friendes wyth whom I haue ben brought vp, nor oportunitie to ſéeke my ſolace in the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences I haue learned: For, of the one ſide the cares of the Kyngdome doe carie mée into thoughtes and heauines, and on the otherſide the libertie of my Wife leaues mée in trouble of conſcience.</p>
               <p>Thus Sir, touching the congratulation you ſent mée for the Biſhoppricke, you are aunſwered by <hi>Marcus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius,</hi> by whom you ſée, it is more ſuretie to the man of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion

and learning to follow the exerciſe of ſtudy, then to aſpire after gouernment and rule: for that in the one he findes contentment with ſtabilitie, where the other mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth nothing but paſſion, perplexitie, and perpetuall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection to reuolution and change.</p>

For that, what of the right hand and what on the left, what with conſcience and what without, men take pleaſure to baniſhe honour by little and little from their houſe, vpon condition notwithſtandinge to ſuffer wealth and treaſure to enter in great aboundance. In caſes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, if the woman be vertuouſe and noble, it is holden for no portion, al men hauinge regarde to the value of her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and more embracing a thouſand Duckattes in gold, then two thouſand good conditions in the partie: Yea wée ſée many maides now a daies rather choſen for their bewty then maried for their vertue.

practiſes: And if ſhe be old without vertue, there is no more poſſibilitie to make her tractable, then without water to quench a flame, whoſe nature is neuer to ceaſe to burne as long as he findes matter to féede his heate. So that to ſuch as enter mariage with thoſe corrupt affections, as there is ſmall merit of pitie or compaſſion, ſo moſt commonly they want no time to repent nor matter to complaine vppon. Let your light ſhine afore men ſaith Chriſt to his diſciples, meaning, that to the eſtabliſhment of their credite was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary they had good renoume, ſhining by their ſinceritie of life not only afore God, but euen in the faces of men, the better to warrant their Doctrine.

In caſes of partialitie and faction, if there bée an hundred infamous men againſt one man of honour, his vertue onely will carie him to more authoritie in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale, then all the ſtrength or ſubteltie of the others without credite.

And how holy and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſo euer a man be, yet may he be ſubiect to contemne or reiect the reuerence that men beare him, and the preſents that are giuen him: but touching the credite of his perſon, and reputation of his good renoume and doctrine, there are none that take pleaſure to leaue them,<note place="margin">Good examples drawe more to perfection then ſpeache.</note> and much leſſe will ſuffer them to decline or diminiſh.

Men of honour and vertuous reputation haue many great priuileges, for good men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſerue them, and ill men are made better by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. Old men are aſſured by them, and the younger ſort draw counſell from them. Yea on them are fixed the eyes, thoughts, and actions of all ſortes of people, in whom their vertues haue wonne ſuch affection, that if they be detected of any crime, yet it is accompted more to miſaduenture then to ſinne, and being accuſed of fault, the malice of their aduerſary is cifted, and they cleared by the teſtimonie of their proper innocencie. For, this is holden a rule amongſt the multitude, that men of vertue and ſuch as haue feare to erre, beare more reſpect to honour, then eyther to life or goods: For that either earely or late the life diſſolueth, and riches muſt be left, but in true honour &amp; good renoume are layd vp our monuments of perpetuitie and fame ſo long as

but takes all to the beſt, he beleeues no report, ſince he is aſſured of her vertue: he is not importunate, but makes his hope his felicitie: if ſhe but begin to like, he puts wings to his affection, yea he makes her y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> image of his thoughts, &amp; liues wholy dedicated to her deuotion. And therefore if he loue dearly, hd liues in thought to pleaſe, in care to offende, in deſire to ſuffer, &amp; in feare to diſcloſe, and louing much he giues much, thinking it no liberalitie if he refuſe any thing, ſince if he haue once giuen his wil and conſent, it is nothing to giue withal his abilitie and wealth: and being poſſeſt by another, he muſt think he hath nothing of his owne: In like ſort the true louer ſtudies to be circumſpect in behauiour, eſtéeming it a ſwéet felicity to haue his thoughts &amp; delytes priuate: he is modeſt in countenance the better to bleare the eyes of ſpies, &amp; pleaſe the minde of his miſtres. And he is patient to ſuffer, eſtéeming him not worthy of reward vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he endure to the ende. And where true loue is, there wronges muſt be borne, and no wordes deliuered to the dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of his Lady: By whom if any occaſion be giuen, yet he muſt alwayes haue this leſſon, that patience is a vertue, and ſecret ſcilence doth beſt ſolicite, ſince the true Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of loue, is not the Tongue that ſpeaketh, but the harte that ſigheth. Yea as the Tongue is reſtrayned from ſpeaking, but not the hearte from Louinge: So I holde it better to loue wyth ſewertie, then to deceiue wyth ſwéet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſince in the one is the vertue, and bringes his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, and the other being the vice, is ſure of his Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhement.

Zenobia</hi> then being the widow of good <hi>Odenatus</hi> Prince of the <hi>Palmerins,</hi> and mother to the naturall heire of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, for that her ſonne was yet young, ſhe tooke vpon her the inſtitution of his youth, and regiment of the Empire. Wherin finding in her firſt gouernment, certaine Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to draw to reuolt, ſhe opened her treaſures, ſhe aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled her forces, and went in perſon into the field, where, in the age of fiue and thirtie yeres and widow, being regent of the whole Eaſt Empire, ſhe was alſo captaine generall of the armie, doing ſuch exploytes, that her enemies ſtoode in feare,<note place="margin">Vertues in the Queene Zeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia.</note> &amp; all the world in woonder of her.

She was ſo iuſt of promiſe that whatſoeuer ſhe leuied by loane or credit, there was no other ſuretie required then the reputation of her owne word.

She was familiar with all ſortes, but ſo particular in friendſhip that there were none knew the ſecret of her counſels till ſhe ſaw time to publiſh them to al.

Only ſhe was ambicious, for that not content with the title of regent, ſhe made her to be called Empreſſe, and adminiſtring the whole in charge, trauaile, and pollecie, ſhe thought ſhe could not be vnworthy of the title, name and dignitie.

faithfull ſeruaunt of God, and yet he was deuided from his countrey and wandered in paine and pouertie. And <hi>Iacob</hi> was a great perſonage and rich, but his children ſelling him that was moſt deare to him, made him complaine of the wickednes of his dayes being then a hundreth and thirtie yeares. All theſe were Patriarches and beter fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured of God then either <hi>Metellus</hi> or <hi>Fabius,</hi> and yet there is no doubt but with their great age, they were paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to tribulations and paſſions, old age béeing no other thing then a veſſell whoſe licour béeing runne out,<note place="margin">Olde age like a drie veſſell.</note> the Caſke becomes drie, and withereth. And albeit thoſe good men haue not bene alone in their paynes and afflictions, for that it is common to all ſuch as liue long to ſuffer the diſeaſes that age bringeth: Yet I compare not our trauels in this our life, with the temptations of the holy Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches and Martirs, who illumined by the holy Ghoſt, haue ſuffred perſecutions for the militant Church: For that God did ſo deale with his ſeruaunts, was in an other reſpect, to proue their fayth, patience, and conſtancie, to the end by their example, we might haue meane of conformitie therevnto.</p>
               <p>But if thoſe peculiar and elect perſonages haue bene trauelled with the dollors of old age, much more are the perplexities of others, in whom fleſh and nature beare more dominion, and ſpirit and grace haue leſſe force.

               <p>But where <hi>Cicero</hi> pretendes a prayſe of old age by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the temperance that is in it not to bee ſubiect to pleaſures with other vices of youth:<note place="margin">Olde men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard in will, but weake in action.</note> It may be aſked him whether old men vſe this temperance for want of will, or for lacke of power, old age for the moſt part bearing a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement inclination to things wherunto the bodie hath leaſt poſſibilitie of action. And albeit temperance ſhines with a cleare light in many old men of reſpect: yet we ſée in moſt of them ſuch a drie deſire and deuocion to the ſportes and actions of youth, that béeing not hable to execute their wil, yet they declare what they would doe, if there were not infirmities. So that I ſée not how that body can be tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate whoſe mind is not qualified, nor that perſon to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned whoſe appetites are at libertie,<note place="margin">It is none other thing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the body, then firſt to con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quere the affec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions.</note> ſéeing it is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to commaund the bodie, then firſt to conquere the affections. Therefore let it be a ſhame to an old man to haue deſire to that which the force and ſtrength of nature denie him to execute.</p>
               <p>What reckoning of temperance is there to be made in old men, ſince their ſtomackes being weake they are the more ſubiect to ſurfet: their mindes fierie, and their bodies drie,<note place="margin">Su<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

It is an ordinary ſpeach with many of theſe old men, that if they were to begin againe, and that in their youth they had known that which the ſucceſſe of yeres hath brought to them, they would liue after an other go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:2054:147"/>
and do otherwayes then they haue done. So that for one young man that hath not done that which hee ought, there be many old men that would do more if they could, to whom it is proper to ſhew a will aboue the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and poſſibilitie of their bodies, euen like to a Drayne Bée, whoſe ſting being ſhot yet he flies vp and downe hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming as though he were hable to do more harme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> in vaine prayſeth old age for his neareneſſe to the other perpetuall and happie life, as for the hope they haue to viſite the ſpirites of good men alreadie layed vp in reſt: Seeing we ſée all men eſchew that iorney, being more naturall to the creatures of nature to prolong life, then to bee officers in that fatall viſitation. Yea <hi>Cicero</hi> himſelfe, ſought to auoyde it when hée was ſurpriſed by his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who compelled him to goe that iorney which hee had ſo much commended, and ſo litle deſired.<note place="margin">The greateſt feare that olde men haue is to die.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It is in vaine to deſire longer life when we ſée nothing but preſent certeintie of death, and yet the greateſt care of olde men is to kéepe them from death, and their greateſt feare to fall into his handes: Yea it is this care that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priues them of the reſidue of the felicities of this life: For that the deſires of the fleſh are ſo ſwéeee and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that naturally wée deſire to eſtabliſh a perpetuitie of our béeing here, though it bée contrary to the eternall ordinance, and impoſſible to the power of kind and nature.

               <p>If an olde man will vſe the authoritie of his age, he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable, &amp; euery one eſcheweth him: and of the contrary if hée play the young man, he is an ill example, and euery one mockes him. The olde man is to do no ſeruice, for that

he hath no power: neither is he to be ſerued for that hée is troubleſome and paſſioned. He is no companion for young men, for that to his yeares belonges too great ceremonie, and euen to old men he is troubleſome by the very proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and impediments of his age ſubiect to hemming, ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, coughing, and many other loathſome diſpoſitions. If they bée poore, their parents diſdayne them, and béeing rich, they are thought to liue too long for their heires and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.

The one of theſe two trauay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers was a couetous man, and the other an enuious man, betwene whom this offer of the Angell bred no ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.

It is a iuſt Sentence, that ſuch as haue beguyled many,<note place="margin">Gods iuſtice go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth by meaſure.</note> ſhould reape the recompence of their abuſes, ſince Gods iuſtice goeth by meaſure, and hath regarde to the equitie of thinges wythout Parciallitie to perſons.

All the vices of this worlde haue in themſelues ſome taſte, except Couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which bringes griefe for the goodes that others haue, and Ielouſie and ſuſpition for the riches that are euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our owne handes. For, to be riche, it belonges alſo to haue the fruition of riches, the ſame giuing pleaſure to ſuch as can take it, as the poſſeſſion ſerueth to ſuch as can vſe it. The perplexities of the couetous man are to ſuſpect his Seruauntes,<note place="margin">Perplexities of the couetous man.</note> and diſtruſt his kindred, to ſet Eſpyalles ouer his Wyfe, and doubt his Children, to bée fearefull of the thiefe, and to be Ielouſe euen of his owne ſhaddowe: Yea he is ſo miſerable, that he ſettes more garde of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney then of his perſon. He takes no pleaſure but in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting his Reckoninges, in Compting his Siluer, in Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Wares, and in multiplying his Commodities, eſtéeming it as his Paradice, to bée alwayes gayning and neuer ſpending, to bée alwayes winninig and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer loaſing, to bée alwayes receiuing and neuer lending, and to be alwayes getting as though he ſhould neuer dye. But when there is queſtion to diſburſe money, though it be for thinges neceſſarie: Oh, then he is as farre from modeſtye, as he is full of malice, accurſing to the Diuell both Wyfe, Children, and Familie, and in that Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hée eſtéemes ſuche to deceaue him moſt, in whom hée hath greateſt reaſon to repoſe Confydence, and who in deede are the beſt Stewardes, and Huſbandes of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modityes. So that if Couetous men would Conſider what a ſwéete thing Lyberalitye is, they would tourne their deſires to gayne much, into a diſpoſition to géeue more, for that, it is not of ſo great value that which the Liberall man doth géeue, as is his recompence: Séeing that for
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:2054:153"/>
the pleaſure hée doth to anye, hée is to Redemaunde the Trybute of his Libertie. Yea, the Liberall man is the Lorde ouer thoſe People where hee lyueth, and the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of all ſuche as haue to doe wyth him:<note place="margin">Diſpraiſes in the couetous nigarde.</note> For that their Recompence béeing certayne, there are none wyll denye him their Seruice: Where, to the Nygarde and Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man, where one wyll heare him, manye wyll feare him: where none wyll ſpeake to him, manye wyll auoyde him: Where none wyll geeue him any thing, many wyll practiſe agaynſt him: Where none will viſitte him, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will abhorre him, where none wyll employe him, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wyll accurſe him: Yea, who wyll Demaunde any thing of the Couetous man that denyeth all thinges to himſelfe? or how hath he a mynde to ſuccour Straungers that is not touched in Conſcience to ſuffer his owne to Starue? Manye Couetous men doe wée ſée now a dayes to whom God geeues Power to gette Ryches, Pollecye to kéepe them, Heartes to defende them, Lyfe to poſſeſſe them, but not Lybertye to reioyce and vſe them: So that though they bee Lordes ouer the Ryches of others, yet they are Slaues euen to that whiche themſelues Poſſeſſe. Wherein I am of Opinyon, that by ſo muche more Excellent is Honeſte Pouertie then Curſed Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe: By how muche the Poore man is contented wyth Little,<note place="margin">Pouertie more excelent then Couetouſneſſe.</note> where to the Richeman a great deale ſeemes nothing. And therefore what mynde canne bée more Myſerable then to ſighe for the goodes of an other, more by deſire then by default? The gréedie mynde caryeth no Diſpoſition to Spende vppon his Parentes and friendes, ſéeing, hée accomptes that Stolne which hée employeth of himſelfe: Therefore it is a falſe Witneſſe to call the couetous man rich, ſince it is not he that hath riches, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther riches are maiſters of him: For the which he takes no ſmall paine to get them, vſeth as great care to kéepe them,
<pb facs="tcp:2054:154"/>
and ſuffereth no leſſe griefe to forgoe them: Yea I accompt not the couetous riche men ſo happie, as the pore labourer and deluer of the earth: For that wyth his mattocke the one drawes reliefe and noriture out of the earth, and the other wretchedly hydes in the earth his treaſure and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, and how ſecretly ſo euer it is hyd, yet he ſtandes not ſo ſuſpicious of any as of himſelfe: For, if he haue two keyes to his Cheſt to kéepe his money from ſtealing, he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth ten cares in his harte to kéepe him from ſpending: So that the care being great to kéep, and the griefe no leſſe to loaſe, I wiſhe all men well aduiſed how they beginne to get, ſince to ſaue a little of their wealth, they are ſubiect to put in hazarde much of their honor. Therefore who will be reuenged of a richeman, can wiſh him no greater paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then to liue long: For that greater is the penaunce by his long lyfe in couetouſneſſe, then any other reuenge that can be taken of him. Great is that ambicion, and ſlaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous that couetouſneſſe, which neyther for ſhame of the worlde, nor for feare of death is reſtrained or moderated, and tenne times great is the abuſe of him, who hauing no neceſſitie, ſéekes to exchaunge contentment for care, ſolace for ſorrow, libertie for bondage, pleaſure for paine, and watching for ſléeping: Yea accurſed is that man that fals from the reputation of ſeruice in warres, to the profeſſion of broakage in martes and Marchaundiſe: And forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to climbe hilles and mountaynes to reſiſt the enemie, is contented to kéepe the vally, and Robbe his Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that be paſſengers: euen lyke to many olde men, who when they waxe weake in force without, ſéeke to growe ſtrong in malice wythin.

Anger is no other thing then a wicked deſire of reuenge, an enemie to all good Councell, and a corrupter of euerie good conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Yea, that which we call anger, is no other thing then a vehement deſire of reuenge, ſomtimes, reſpecting the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that is giuen, but for the moſt part puſhed forwarde by a wicked minde of the partye whom he poſſeſſeth,<note place="margin">Diſcriptions of an angry man.</note> and when the puniſhment excéedes the fault, then it hath chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the qualetie of anger into an habite of reuenge. The man that is angrie, beléeues no aduice of friendes, and is careleſſe euen of his owne eſtate: He is ſuſpicious of all men, and ſuddeine in his actions, his face is fierie, and his handes ready to ſtrike, his thoughtes are malicious, and his tongue trayned to all ſpeaches of diſpight and reproache: He is diſpoſſeſt of all temperance, modeſty, and reaſon, and
<pb facs="tcp:2054:157"/>
runnes as one Poſſeſt wyth a wicked Spirite to all actes of Crueltie, iniurie, and tyranny. Anger caryeth wyth it theſe wicked conditions, that for once that wée Lende him our will, hée will be alwayes after Lorde ouer all our doings, and doe all thinges that hée lyſte agaynſt our wyll. All men Poſſeſte wyth anger are lyke to a Lamppe, who by the ſuperfluitie of Oyle géeues no lyght, but caſtes out certayne ſparckling ſnuffes and flames. But in a Mage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate or man of Authoritie, there is nothing that more diſcouereth his vertue or vice, for that though he haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to rebuke offences, yet he hath no permiſſion to ſhew himſelfe paſſionate. It is a iuſt thing that ſuche as offende the Lawes, ſhould receiue the Puniſhments of the Lawes, but yet ſuch ought to be the moderation of paynes, as that they aſpire not to the degrée and effect of reuenge: ſince all men féele wyth more griefe the violent rygoure that is done them, then the iudiciall Puniſhement they receiue: So that a man to reſtraine or correct his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,<note place="margin">No greater tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph then too conquer affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> is not onely a vertue, but a grace ſupernaturall, for that in worldly thinges there can bée no greater kinde of Tryumph, then euerie one to haue the victory of his owne hearte. And albéeit Anger is then ſomewhat tollerable, when the occaſion is iuſte, yet béeing a vice ſo imperious in man, I would not wiſhe any ſufferaunce géeuen to it, for that all that comes of it is wicked, and of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Nature hurtfull. There bée many thinges which in the beginning wée haue Power eyther to receaue or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, but if Anger haue once taken Poſſeſſion of vs, it Sinkes (as a Stoane throwne into a Ryuer) and ſtayeth not tyll it come to the bottome of our hartes: and if reaſon ryſe agaynſt it. It wyll not bée remooued, for that it hath taken too déepe roote in our thoughtes and wil. The ſame béeing the cauſe, that all thinges that Angrie men doe, are of neceſſitie blinde and fooliſhe, for that it is not a thing eaſie that a man troubled wyth anger, ſhould
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:2054:157"/>
haue vſe of reaſon: And dooing thinges without reaſon, hée doth them wythout art, and ſo by conſequence wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rule, wiſedome, or diſcreſſion. Let euery man therefore, Labour to hate Anger for the diſcommodities that are in it, and learne to bée temperate,<note place="margin">Repentance the very ſtipend &amp; effect of malice</note> wherein is the true ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and contentment. He that abſteynes from ſpeaking villanie, is moſt wyſe, ſince Repentaunce is the verye ſtipende and effect of Malice, and there is ſeldome any thing vttered in Malice, which tournes not to the hurte of the ſpeaker. Wée fynde by experience that to a man in Choller, it is a Principall Remedy to Correct his tongue, and delaye a little to doe Reuenge: For, men ſpeake and doe many thinges in their Anger, which they wiſhe afterwardes had neuer paſſed their thoughtes. The man that is wronged, is not forthwyth to be delt withall to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the iniurie, but rather to delay and reſpitte the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge: For that,<note place="margin">VVhere is no ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pacitie of coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cell, there per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions are in vaine.</note> a man dwelling in paſſion is not apt to pardon readely, if firſt he be not appeaſed. And therefore to ſéeke to reduce a man to reaſon, ſo long as hée is poſſeſt wyth the heate of his furie, is but loſſe of diligence: For that hauing no capacitye of councell, perſwaſions are in vaine, &amp; where there is not a ſpirit tractable, there can be no poſſibility of reformation, being better to ſuffer his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, then to miniſter aduiſe, for that bathing in the heate of his anger, he ſtandes more néede of a brydle then of a ſpur. Therfore whoſoeuer hath conuerſation with a man cholle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike, ſtandes in more neceſſity of polecie then of power, for that anger being to be appeaſed by diſcreſſion, receiues no medecine if it be not perfect in time, place, qualetie,<note place="margin">Time reformes more thinges then reaſon.</note> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery other circumſtaunce conducible to purge but not to paine. There be more thinges which time moderates then that reaſon accordes, as are ſéene in the experience of many great quarrelles of many great perſonages, whom ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther friendes could entreat, nor enemies feare, nor Golde could allure, nor other preſentes reclaime: And yet, after
<pb facs="tcp:2054:158"/>
time haue had his Courſe, there hath bene founde a facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in that which afore ſéemed difficult and deſperate. Time hath power to change parties and paſſions,<note place="margin">Time hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to moderate paſſions.</note> &amp; to newe men, to giue newe affections, by which it happeneth, that he that ſuffereth with the time, ſhal ſée burne the hart of his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in the ſame fire wherewyth he ſuppoſeth himſelfe is conſumed: the wiſe man hath his tongue in his hart, but he that is angrie and furious hath his hart in his tongue: The one is angrie for that he ſuffereth, and prayſeth all that he ſpeaketh, but the other is gréeued when his Tongue Runnes at Lybertye, and reioyſeth moſt when hée ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth moſt: Yea, Patience is the inuention of God, and leades men to beare all mutations wyth courage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, and in Calamities not to bée vnfurniſhed of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here hath bene an Auncient Queſtion, what be the Ages of mans life, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be ſixe or ſeuen of them, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (the better to be reſolued) we muſt preſuppoſe, that this word age is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanded in two ſortes, as the age of the world, and the age of man. The age of the world beares nomber and reckoning, both according to the Poets, and collection of the chriſtian authors: the poets make foure ages of the worlde, the firſt of Golde, the ſecond of ſiluer, the third of braſſe, the fourth of Iron. The firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentor of this particion of ages, was <hi>Sibill of Cuma,</hi> from whom the Latine Poets draw their coniectures, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in <hi>Ouid</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt booke of his <hi>Metamor.</hi> where he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſeth vpon the foure Ages, when, and how they paſſed. And according to the accompt of the chriſtians, ther be viii. ages, that is to ſay, ſeauen afore the comming of Chriſt, and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:2054:158"/>
one ſince. But becauſe our queſtion concernes nothing the ages of the world, we will leaue them at libertie, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon only of the ages of men. Whereof I ſée not how it is poſſible to ſpeake reſolutely, for that it is a thing not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in it ſelfe, and hanges altogether vppon the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and opinions of auncient writers, of whom we haue to beleue beſt, ſuch as bare moſt credite. Firſt it is affirmed by many that there be theſe ſeuen ages in the life of man, infancie, puerilitie, mans eſtate, youth, grauetie, old age, and ſtate decrepit: they reſtraine one part of theſe ages to a certaine nomber of yeares, and leaue the reſt without limit.</p>
               <p>Touching the opinion of the nomber, it ſemes to holde ſome ſimilitude with reaſon: for that ſeuen is a nomber v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall and accompliſhed. And in that nomber if wée accompt the ſeuen Planets, the mouing of whom cauſeth the generations and corruptions in the earth. By greater reaſon vnder this word ſeuen we may alſo applie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> courſe and continuation of the time: for that by the ſame ſcience and reaſon that the auncients reduced the Planets into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and they to encloſe in their motions, the reuolution of times: euen by the ſame may we alſo eſtabliſh ſeuen ages, which may comprehend the life and continuance of man. There were others that ſet downe but ſixe ages, <hi>Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, Puerilitie, Mans ſtate, Youth, Grauetie, and Old age:</hi> of this opinion is <hi>Jſidorus,</hi> whom, by reaſon of his authoritie, wée will follow for the preſent, confeſſing notwithſtanding that in ſome reſpects there may be ſeuen ages in the life of man. But this laſt opinion ſemes moſt reaſonable in this, for that it ſpeaketh more diſtinctly of the yeres of the ages, then the other that eſtabliſheth ſeuen, for that it can not debate deſtinctly of the yeres of youth and mans ſtate.<note place="margin">Infancie.</note> In this ſort is the reckoning of theſe ages. <hi>Jnfancie,</hi> which is the firſt age, begins euen from the birth of man, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth til ſeuen yeres be accompliſhed, it is called in Latine
<pb facs="tcp:2054:159"/>
                  <hi>Jnfantia,</hi> for that in that age all thinges are holden childiſh that he doth, not hauing any libertie of ſpéech, nor other thing to expreſſe his perfection.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Puerilitie.</note>
                  <hi>Puerilitie,</hi> being the ſecond age, continueth from ſeuen to fourtene yeres. The Latines call it <hi>Pueritia,</hi> for that it is an age pure, and not ſtayned with any abhominable vice, being as yet not defiled with vnchaſt mocions, nor diſpoſed to the vile pleaſures of the fleſh, as afterwardes it is. Of this beaſtlines and vile humor of the fleſh,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 6.</note> the Apoſtle makes plaine diſcription when he bids vs ſhoonne fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For, all other ſinnes that man commits, are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his bodie, but he that commits whoredome, ſinneth in his body, and againſt his bodie. This age then is very pure, as being not ſo hable to the beaſtly actions of the fleſh as is the other that ſuccéedes, which is <hi>Mans estate,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the text in <hi>Geneſis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gene. 8.</note> ſaying: <hi>the ſenſes and thoughtes of the hart of man, are giuen to ill, euen from his Mans estate.</hi> But for al this we muſt not thinke that <hi>Puerilitie</hi> is exemp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted from the vices and ſinnes which generally defile man: For, that which comes from the hart, corruptes man ſayth the Lord, and therefore ſince this age is not frée from lende words and wicked thoughts, it can not be altogether pure: So that to exempt it altogether from ſinne, is too great an error. And where ſome holde that children béeing ſomewhat growne, haue no ſinne, but begin to ſinne at fouretene yeares when haire begins to appeare in their naturall places: It were an opinion to bée ſuffred, if men committed ſinne in no other members then in their partes of generation. But who doubtes that ſtealing, lying, and ſwearing bée not ſinnes, whereunto young children aboue all other vices are moſt enclined: So that wee may ſay that this age is exempt onely from the ſinne of the fleſh, but not from other corruptions. And albeit it bee pure and cleane from vice in his beginning, yet that innocencie continueth not till the end of the age, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:2054:159"/>
for that in the beginning they haue not the vſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and by that want, no power to doe good or ill, as to bée eſtéemed yll or good: Séeing the good and the ill are meaſured by the diſcretion of the doers, for that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> all the operations and mocions of man procéede of the vnderſtanding and will. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is hard to iudge of the workes and diſpoſitions of litle children, till by encreaſe of yeares they enter into the vſe of reaſon, a time when they haue habilitie to do well or ill: The ſame béeing the cauſe why the Cannon ſpeakes not indiſtinctly of all children, but onely of ſuch as are ſomewhat rayſed into yeares and age: For, it impugnes nothing the opinion of ſuch as ſaye that litle children are without ſinne, but meanes expreſſely of ſuch as are ten or twelue yeares of age, who in déede are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from ſinne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mans estate,</hi> which is the third age,<note place="margin">Mans eſtate.</note> begins at fiftene yeares, and continueth till eight and twentie, according to <hi>Iſidores</hi> opinion. This age, the Latines call <hi>Adoleſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> for two reaſons, the one for their poſſibilitie and neare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to engender: the other for that they encreaſe and riſe into ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Touching the firſt, it is referred to the beginning of this age, wherein young men approch the power of procreation, which was further from them in their childhode as hath bene ſayed. The ſecond conſideration beholdes chiefely the end of that age, according to the opinion of many, who holde that man encreaſeth till twentie, or two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares, which is the end of <hi>Mans estate.</hi> But <hi>Jſido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> ſayth, that <hi>Adoleſcentia</hi> laſteth till eight and twentie yeres, notwithſtanding man doth not alwayes riſe in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing till then, and yet it ſéemes that, that age tooke his name directly of encreaſe, for that then man comes to his perfect growth.</p>
               <p>In the ages afore rehearſed, <hi>Jnfancie</hi> and <hi>Puerilitie,</hi> man
<pb facs="tcp:2054:160"/>
groweth ſtill, yea and in one part of the third age, which is <hi>Adoloſcentia:</hi> But in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ages following he groweth nothing for that he hath taken his perfection afore. And therefore, ſeeing all growing endes in <hi>Adoloſcentia</hi> (for after that age man encreaſeth nothing) the name of encreaſe or growing doth moſt properly appertaine to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Youth.</note>
                  <hi>Youth,</hi> which is the fourth age, entreth at nine and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and endeth at fiftie as <hi>Iſidore</hi> affirmeth. The Latines call it <hi>Inuentus,</hi> by reaſon of the helpes and aides that the world hath of men of that age, as in deede that title is moſt proper to him by reaſon of the force and vertue which men of that age haue. In the former ages, men are not knit, nor haue their forces accompliſhed: But in this age they haue their full ſtrength, and are well hable to endure all impoſitions of paine, burdens, or trauell.</p>
               <p>In this is diſcerned the difference of the two opinions, the one eſtabliſhing ſeuen ages, and <hi>Iſidore</hi> reckoning but ſixe. Such as make a nomber of ſeuen, deuide youth, adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto him an other part which they call <hi>Virilitie.</hi> But according to <hi>Iſidore</hi> there is but one age, and that is called <hi>Youth,</hi> which me thinkes is not to begin at the end of <hi>Mans estate</hi> at eight and twentie yeres as <hi>Iſidore</hi> holdeth: But it were better to determine <hi>Mans eſtate</hi> at one and twentie yeres, a time wherein he hath taken his groath, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eſtabliſh the beginning of <hi>youth,</hi> which is to laſt vntill thirtie yeres or there about, and after it may ſuccéede <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,</hi> which may endure vntill L, where <hi>Jſidore</hi> eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſheth the end of <hi>youth.</hi> According to this order the names of the ages may go properly with them: For, <hi>Junentus</hi> takes his name of this Latine Verbe <hi>iunare,</hi> ſignifying to <hi>aide</hi> or <hi>helpe,</hi> and in that age men are moſt conuenient to be employed, and of moſt habilitie to giue aide. And <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irilitie</hi> deriueth from this Latine Noune <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ires</hi> ſignifying <hi>ſtrength,</hi> as an age wherein men being compleate, are in there grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt force. And ſo as the <hi>youngman</hi> is good to miniſter aide
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:2054:160"/>
and helpe, ſo in the man accompliſhed is good habilitie to do things of himſelfe: For to haue neceſſitie of aide, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the forces yet weake and not accompliſhed, but to do any thing of our ſelues is a true ſigne of ſtrength fully furniſhed. Beſides, it is of common proofe, that a man comes not to his full ſtrength till he be thirtie yeres olde, and therefore by good reaſon that eſtate of age may be called <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irilitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Jſidorus,</hi> thinking not to ſeperate <hi>virilitie</hi> from <hi>youth,</hi> ſets downe other termes and limits to ages, eſtabliſhing the end of <hi>Mans ſtate</hi> at eight and twentie yeres, and not at one and twentie, and appoynting the begining of <hi>youth</hi> at nine and twentie, (a ſeaſon that beſt makes perfect the ſtrength of men) he puts no difference betwene <hi>virilitie</hi> and <hi>youth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth age is called <hi>Grauetie</hi> or <hi>Vnweldineſſe:</hi> Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this age, the two opinions aforeſayd do differ in name only, <hi>Jſidore</hi> calling it <hi>vnweldineſſe,</hi> and the other gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it no title at all. They both ſéene to take the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie of the Latine word, the one calling it <hi>ſenectus</hi> and the other <hi>ſeniam,</hi> notwithſtanding it concerne diuerſe ages. This age of <hi>vnweldineſſe</hi> begins at fiftie yeres, and ends at thréeſcore and ten as <hi>Jſidore</hi> holdeth, who calleth it <hi>vnwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe,</hi> becauſe the qualitie of heauines or waight, makes fall all things lower. And as in the other foure ages afore, men grow either in ſtature or in force: ſo in this age their ſtrength ſéemes to determine, and their bodies and partes begin to decaye, &amp; decline to debilitie: For, vntil fiftie yeres man mayntaines alwayes his ſtrength and ſtature, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he begins to feint as one that had runne his courſe, and doth nothing but heape infirmities and weakneſſe euen vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>till death. According to the opinion of ſuch as eſtabliſh ſeuen ages, this eſtate of yeres is called old age, wherunto <hi>Iſidore</hi> conſents not, but calles that old age which begins at thrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ten, and continueth til death though man liue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb facs="tcp:2054:161"/>
ſo long. So that all the other ages are reſtrained to certaine limits of yeares, but this laſt age is ſubiect to no terme, for that the day and houre of mans death are not knowne. <hi>Jſidore,</hi> (ſpeaking of this age) ſayth that old age béeing the ſixth age, can not bée limitted nor made ſubiect to terme, for that there is attributed vnto it the reſidue of the life of man which paſſeth the firſt fiue ages. But tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching all that hath bene ſayd heretofore, that euery age of the life of man hath his certaine termes and limits except the laſt: It is to be vnderſtand that al is ſpoken of the ages of men of our time, and not of ſuch as were afore the floud, ſince in thoſe ſeaſons, the age of men were a thouſand yeres. Neither do we meane the men of the ſecond age, which begonne from the floud vntill <hi>Abraham:</hi> for that in that age there were men that liued ſixe hundreth yeares, and ſome foure hundreth, as appeareth by the Doctrine of <hi>Geneſis.</hi> And yet thoſe men ſayth <hi>Jſidore,</hi> had no more age then we, and all their yeares limitted to a certaine time and terme, except the laſt age, whereunto could bée aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed no certaintie of terme, for that (as it is found in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis</hi>) ſome liued longer then others: and therefore their ages were not compted in that fourme of yeares that wée recken oures: For, we take the beginning of our fifth age, which is called <hi>Vnweldineſſe,</hi> at fiftie yeares: Which could not bée in the men of the firſt times, ſéeing the fifth age preſuppoſeth in vs a debilitie of ſtrength and naturall operations: a thing which could not happen to the firſt men, for that if they had begonne to decline at fiftie yeres, they could not by any poſſibilitie haue endured ſo long, ſéeing there were of them that liued more then fiftie yeres. So that wée may eſtabliſh the fifth age of thoſe people to begin at thrée hundreth yeares or there about, aſpiring very neare the third part of their life. In which reſpect, this fifth age hauing an other beginning in them then in vs, I thought it not out of purpoſe to touch ſomewhat
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:2054:161"/>
thoſe ages which had not the ſame termes whereunto wée are ſubiect at this preſent. Here muſt bée conſidered the accompt that wée applie to the third age, and other ages ſince vntill <hi>Dauid,</hi> in whoſe time men liued no more then they doe now according to his owne teſtimonie <hi>the dayes of man are threeſcore yeares,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 89</note> and if any liue till foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore, the reſidue of their life is but griefe and trauell:</p>
               <p>Touching the ages of the men of the firſt and ſecond worlde, wée can not ſpeake reſolutely, nor of the termes or limittes whereunto they were referred. One reaſon is, for that thoſe thinges were not continued vntill theſe later times where were authors &amp; writers to record them, And withall for that thoſe thinges which were once paſt, &amp; no more in nature, the writers had no great care to diſpoſe them to monument. To this may bée alſo added an other reaſon more peremptorie, that notwithſtanding the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors had will to deſcribe particularly thoſe thinges, as they had done the ages: Yet they had no meane there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, ſeeing experience ſheweth vs the ages which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for procreation, in what ſeaſon man forbeares to grow, in what time hée is in his flower, and when hée begins to decline. By which the wiſemen tooke meane not only to Baptiſe and diſtinguiſh the ages of man, but alſo to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte ſuch as were ſubiect to terme. From the firſt and ſecond age of the worlde, wée are aſſured that the age of men was deuided into ſixe as it is nowe. For, the men of that ſeaſon felt the ſame mutations that wée féele, and did not engender in all ages, and yet in certaine ages they were hable to procreation. They grew into ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ſtrength vntill certaine times, and afterwardes their growing ceaſed. In a certain age they were in their flower, and in an other they began to wither and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline. But wée knowe not in what terme nor in what tyme they ſuffred theſe mutations, as now experience
<pb facs="tcp:2054:162"/>
in our ſelues makes them eaſely knowne to vs. That was the cauſe why the wiſe men of thoſe times could not limit to certaine termes of yeres, the ages of men of the firſt and ſecond world, as oures are. Moreouer if any will diſpute that there is more reaſon to eſtabliſh ſeuen ages in the life of man, then ſixe, for that the Scripture makes mention of <hi>ſenectus</hi> and <hi>ſenium,</hi> that is old age, and ſtate decrepit: it may be aunſwered, that the Scripture appoynts no more ages to the life of man, then doth <hi>Jſidore:</hi> For, theſe two wordes <hi>ſenectus</hi> and <hi>ſenium,</hi> as the two later ages of man which <hi>Jſidore</hi> calles by other names, naming <hi>vnweldineſſe</hi> that which the Scripture calles olde age: and old age, that which in the Scripture is called ſtate decrepit.</p>
               <p>There is alſo an other reaſon agréeing with the opinion of <hi>Iſidore,</hi> that <hi>ſenectus</hi> and <hi>ſenium</hi> be not taken in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for two ages, but for one, &amp; that to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pouder or ouſt of the life of man. Old age ſaith <hi>Iſidore,</hi> which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſixth age, is not limitted, for that al that remaines of the life of man, (after the fiue firſt ages be paſt) is layd and referred to olde age. Touching the ſtate decrepit, it is the end of old age cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led <hi>ſenium,</hi> as holding vpon the traine of the ſixth age. This laſt opinion ſemes not the leaſt likely, and moſt conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ſaying of <hi>Iſidore,</hi> by whom is not ment that the decrepit ſtate is the vttermoſt end of old age: For ſo ſhould it be one ſelfe thing with death, and hold no part of life: but it is ment that the ſtate decrepit makes one part of the life of man and of the ſixt age, according to the teſtimonie of <hi>J<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidore.</hi> So that we may conclude that it is not an age di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and abſolute, but part of an age, being (as it were) the dregges and pouder of old age, and generally of all the life of man. And for death, much leſſe that it is part of the life of man, ſéeing we hold it a iuſt meane of priuation of life. But if any diſpoſed to cift ſtraitly our opinion, will aſke this queſtion, that ſéeing the ſtate decrepit is one part of our life, why we make not an age of it as we do of the other
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:2054:162"/>
partes of the life of man. It may be aunſwered that by ſo much is the queſtion vaine, by how much the matter is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible: For, al the other ages are ſubiect to beginning and end, and are determinable to a certain content, proportion and nomber of yeres. And touching old age, albeit his end can not aſſuredly be determined, yet it is knowne in what time he begins, which is about threeſcore and ten yeres. But the ſtate decrepit drawes an other courſe, as hauing neither beginning nor end certaine and terminable, and therefore can not be called an age diſtinct, and of it ſelfe: The ſame being eaſely ſéene in this, that it containes that reſidue of the life of man, wherein the body is made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weldie with many infirmities, the which appeares after a man be entred into olde age and not afore, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding we ſéeme to féele and ſuffer vnweldineſſe. So that, that part of the life which is ſo grieuous, hath no certaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, ſéeing thoſe infirmities come ſooner to one then to an other, and endure either more or leſſe according to the complexions of perſons: and therefore that can not well bée called an age compleate, but rather part of an age.</p>
               <p>This eſtate decrepit hath bene referred with great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the yeares of olde age, béeing the laſt and extremeſt of all the other ages: For that, there remaynes no other thing to ſuch as are come to it, but death. And for that ſuch as liue ſo long, are naturally ſubiect to many grieues and ſorowes, ſome men haue called the end of this laſt age <hi>ſenium:</hi> An opinion fully conformable with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: For, as it is here alleadged that the ſtate decrepit is the laſt part of the life of man and followeth olde age. So the Scripture accomptes the continuance and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of our life to thréeſcore and ten yeeres, referring the reſidue but to trauayle, and dollor. So that this part of the life ſo ouerladen with infirmities is that which we call ſtate decrepit, and the Latines <hi>ſenium,</hi> béeing in déede the laſt age called olde age. The beſt dayes of the life of men

                  <p>Touching the firſt opinion eſtabliſhing two ages of old age, and ſtate decrepit, it is contrary to all good authors, who haue alwayes taken olde age for the laſt age of man, not meaning that the ſtate decrepit was an age diſtinct, but a part of old age. Wherein if it be alledged that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit ſtate is not taken for the laſt part of the ſixth age, for that it hath no beginning limitted, nor any end determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, but that it is taken for the laſt age, which is limit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted in his beginning, notwithſtanding it hath no end deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, as beginning at thréeſcore and ten yeares and laſting vntill death, and that this age alſo is that which ſome call olde age. It may bée aunſwered that taking the termes and limittes in that ſort, thée agrée with the firſt
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:2054:164" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and ſecond opinion touching the two laſt ages, and that there is no difference but in the names. So that wée may conclude that the ſecond opinion is more auayleable then the firſt, for that it conſents in names of the ages with the good authours and Poets. Wherein truly for thinges that lie in act and haue bene inuented, thoſe opinions that holde moſt conformetie with the iudgements of good au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, ought to bée reputed as moſt true. The third opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion aduouched by <hi>M. Varo,</hi> albeit it be in ſome ſort ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, yet <hi>Jſidore</hi> ſatiſfieth more at full, for that he puts vnweldineſſe for an age betwéene youth and old age: For, firſt in that age men feele a manifeſt mutation which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth well to deare the name of age: Seeing that proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly olde age may be called that time wherein the iudgement of man beginneth to fayle &amp; diminiſh, both by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greatnes of age, and indiſpoſition of the body and perſon.</p>
                  <p>Touching youth, it is the flower of the age of man, ſince in that age hée is man compleat, and perfect in his forces, actions, and naturall operations: but that age be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſt, al thinges that are in man begin to decline. Then it is that the force of the body, and vertues naturall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to weare and wax weake: Of which decay procéedes alſo a diminution of iudgement and vnderſtanding. All which are diſcerned dayly by ordinarie experience, beſides the reaſons and arguments conducible to proue them: For, firſt experience ſheweth vs that as man falleth in corporall ſtrength, ſo his iudgement begins to growe weake and frayle: but the ſenſe and vnderſtanding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne in puretie and vertue. The reaſon is, for that the ſtrength of the body and forces naturall, are powers ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall, and ſubiect to alteration and change. But the ſenſe and vnderſtanding béeing not materiall, can not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fall into mutation but by ſome accident, and by the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the body, according to the Doctrine of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:2054:165"/>
that the vnderſtanding waxeth not olde, although the body doth. And therefore there may be ſometimes wherein man may loaſe all his corporall forces, afore the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding taſt of any ſuch infirmitie: But to ſay that that time may bée reduced into an age to call it old age, it can not well bée ſo, for that the ſenſe and vnderſtanding are weakened in olde age: So that, that age may bée called vnweldineſſe according to the <hi>Etymelogie</hi> of <hi>Iſidore</hi> ſaying thus: Some thinke the Latines called olde men <hi>ſenes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the debilitie of ſence falling vppon olde men whom the greatnes of age makes raue, and ſubiect to incertaine fancies.</p>
                  <p>The naturall Philoſophers ſay alſo that fond men and idiots haue for the moſt part their bloud cold, as men wiſe and well compound haue it hot and ſturring: the ſame bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the occaſion that olde men hauing their bloud cold, and young children in whom it is not yet hot enough, are not reſolute in their iudgements: ſo that it is no great error to compare together old men and children, as equall in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature. For, doting olde men are fooliſh by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their age, and in young children is no power of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by reaſon of their minoritie. Secondly, this ſecond opinion which eſtabliſheth onely ſixe ages is moſt common<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly approued of wiſemen, and agréeth with the iudgement of <hi>Jſidore</hi> that the Philoſophers haue diſtinguiſhed the life of man by thoſe ſixe termes. Thirdly this ſecond opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath a ſimilitude with the names which the <hi>Greekes</hi> haue attributed to ages, calling that which followeth youth <hi>Preſbiter,</hi> and in place of olde age they vſe <hi>geron:</hi> ſo that <hi>Preſbiter</hi> is an other age then olde age, as alſo <hi>Jſidore</hi> calles it <hi>Vnweldineſſe.</hi> And ſure thoſe that ſtand in that eſtate and proportion of age, may bée called neither young nor olde, but occupie (as it were) a meane degrée betwene both according to the opinion of <hi>Jſidore</hi> ſpeaking thus.</p>

But the Poets haiel gone further, as deuiding euery age into their partes, aſſigning properly his beginning, his middle, and his end, according to the Doctrine of <hi>Aristoris</hi> that all thinges are drawne into thoſe thrée.

The vayne louers of the Worlde haue this cuſtome, to reproche the affection they beare one to an other, which much leſſe that it is tollerable amongeſt the ſeruauntes of God, ſéeing they ought to make ſo ſmall accompt of their loue, as not to demaunde any thing they pretende but by the meane and vertue of his loue: For, ſo high &amp; ſouereigne is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> commaundement of the loue of God, that onely in this mortall life we can not ſcarſely learne it, and in the other world of ioyes fully accompliſhe it.<note place="margin">Exod.</note>

Wherein the Prophete hath great occaſion to exclaime that al our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and affections are fleſhely and corrupt, ſéeing that wyth the ſelfe ſame harte wherewyth wée ought to loue God, wée loue alſo our Children, our neyghbours, and our Parentes, Yea ſometimes wee tranſferre that affection to our vnlawfull friendes, ſéeking out of one moulde to drawe an apple of Golde, and boollettes of earth.

But ſuche are the gratious meanes and bountie of the Lorde, the hée ſpeakes not to vs as a Mayſter to his Seruauntes, but as a Brother, vſinge the Nature and Phraſe of a very famyliar and gracious friende. By this wée haue to conſider that by how muche, Golde is a thing moſt eſtéemed, beſte béeloued, and of all other Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches wyth greateſt importunitie deſired, by ſo much loue is the vertue that moſt delyghtes vs, that aboue all other wée honour, and that more then any other doth content vs: For the harte that is inflamed wyth the loue of God, makes a baſe Eſtimation of all the other Ryches and Treaſures of the Worlde: And of all the Particuler thinges vnder Heauen, loue coulde not bée better reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled then to Golde, nor Golde more Equaly Compared then to loue. For a there is nothing how ryche ſo euer it bée which is not to bée bought wyth Golde, ſo if loue bée the worker, there is nothing ſo harde and difficult, which by the operation of loue is not made eaſie and paſſible: where by it foloweth that the hart which is wounded with loue, takes his reſt &amp; ſolace in ſeruice, &amp; in reapoſing, takes paine and trauel.

In this part of the text we haue alſo to conſider, that the Lord willeth vs not to buy gold of any other then of him, offring it to vs of him ſelfe both purified and burning, and all to inſtruct vs, that it is he only of whom we are to obtaine grace to loue him, and loue to ſerue him. Beſides, this gold of the loue of the Lord will not be communicated to vs for nothing, leaſt we ſhould eſtéeme it little: Neither is it to be ſold to vs at a deare price, to the end we refuſe it not, and much leſſe will it bée priſed, becauſe it is without value and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: onely all that is required of vs, is, that we retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute vnto the Lord, loue for loue, and giue our affection in recompence and change of his.

Amongeſt ſuch as are ſicke, it is a ready degrée to amendement, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoſe hope in their Phiſition: euen ſo where the cauſe is more then naturall, there the office of the Phiſition is but vaine, for that the patient languiſheth more by opinion the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by infirmitie. It ill becomes the Phiſition to laught at the griefe of his Patient, and yet the cauſe being found vaine and eaſie, there is no reaſon he ſhould make ſorowe where the cure is neither deſperate nor doubtfull: and more doth it concerme the comfort of the ſick, that he be mery with the paſſion of his Patient, then to diſſemble a heauines in that which of it ſelfe is both light and friuolous. It hath bene alwaies a condicion of the world that where ſome periſhed, others found ſafetie, where one receiued honour, an other ſuffered infamie: And where ſome find cauſe to ſmile and laugh, others are followed with teares &amp; wéeping, al pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding of the inſtabilitie and change that followeth all the thinges of the world. And as in one place of the ſea we ſée the water calme and mylde, and in an other full of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt and ſtorme: and one part of the land diſpoſed to diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of weathers, and an other quarter all cleare and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued. So it happeneth many times to the Children
<pb facs="tcp:2054:177"/>
of men, that according to their diuerſitie of complexions, they bring forth varietie of Paſſion, ſome ſuffring ſicknes, when others enioy health, many ſubiect to malencolly, when others delite to be merie, and ſundrie féele the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach with laughing, when the reſt get ſore eyes with teares and wéeping. So that it being a thing ſure, that calmes ſuccéede ſtormes, and ſtormes followe fayre weather, it is good that none ſwell and riſe high in proſperitie, and much leſſe be doubtfull in aduerſitie: For that in the end there is no perplexitie which weareth not, nor any pleaſure which loaſeth not his proper qualitie. And as all thinges are to be taken in one of theſe thrée ſortes, either to lament them, laugh at them, or diſſemble them. So, good Madame, your Paſſion (riſing but for the loſſe of your litle Dogge,) deſerueth more to be laughed at then diſſembled, ſéeing that as you loued it vainely, ſo, though you wéepe for it, yet your ſorrowe can not bée but light. Our Moother <hi>Eue</hi> ſorowed for her ſonne <hi>Abell,</hi> and <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> wept for her ſinnes: but you bearing litle compaſſion to your preſent offences, and leſſe conſideration to your vertues paſt, forbeare not to ſhed teares for the loſſe of your litle Dogge. A paſſion heretofore neuer expreſſed by any, and much leſſe conuenient to your reputation &amp; grauetie: For that to great Ladies ſtriuing to be holden modeſt and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, it ought to be a chiefe care to auoyd the imputation of vanitie &amp; lightnes. And true teares being no other thing the droppes of bloud which diſtil from the hart by the eyes, there is nothing wherein we can expreſſe better effect of true affection, then to wéepe for the loſſe of our friend: For that the ſorowfull hart being encloſed within the intrailes, hauing neither féete to goe, nor handes to make ſignes, hée manifeſteth by mouth that which hée loueth, and by his teares makes declaration of his payne. By which argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (good Madam) I ſay it can not bée but you beare no ſmall affection to your litle Dogge, ſéeing you mourne for
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:2054:177"/>
him with ſo great apparance of ſorowe. The tongue publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth nothing but our thoughts, but in the teares is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the true propertie of our affection, whereuppon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that though in men and women bée found ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time a cuſtome of fayned wordes, yet, it can not bee but their teares for the moſt part are true and ſimple. And therfore it is a falſe teſtimonie againſt women to ſay that their teares bée alwayes fayned, although in this they may diſſemble, when they wéepe for one thing, to ſay it is for an other, béeing a propertie very familiar with the moſt of them to haue two coollers to one meaning, and (as the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is) to beare two complexions in one face. This I haue ſayed for the defence of your ſighes, and in fauour of your teares, which I thinke you haue ſhed with ſmall deuocion, although with very franke and good hart, ſéeing (according to the reapport) you haue bene euer ſince tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed with an Ague, and exerciſed in thoſe paſſions that kéepe you continually in your Bedde. But to vſe plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes (according to my profeſſion) I can not maruell ſo much at your teares, as I am ſory that ſo ſmall a thing ſhould make you to wéepe, being a thing more vertuous to lament your ſinnes, then to be heauie for the loſſe of your litle pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie.

Your friends here beare ſome ſhame, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you haue choſen ſo baſe a ſubiect to gouern your affection, &amp; (not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out reaſon) do your enemies ſmile, &amp; your frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds mourne at it, for that it is contrary to the vertue and reputation of any, either to fixe their eyes, or occupie their thoughts, but
<pb facs="tcp:2054:178"/>
where the hart may be well employed, and the loue grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. The beſt part of the body is the hart, and the moſt precious iewell of the hart, is the affection, which if it bée not well employed, the partie may eſteme himſelfe vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, for that in that man there can be poſſibilitie to liue well, in whom is no proofe or meane of honeſt affection. What propertie of loue ſhold you beare to your little pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, from who you could draw no other pleaſure, then to araye your garments with haires, to make a noyſe in your chamber when you would ſléepe, to fill you ful of fleaſe, and to be alwayes in feare to be ſtolne from you, all which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude againſt your wiſedome, for mourning for a thing ſo harmefull and of ſo baſe importance. To loue a little dogge, a Monkie, a Parrot, or other ſinging Bird, is not ill, nor diſhoneſt, if your affection be ioyned to this condicion, not to followe them otherwayes then with your eyes to behold them, and your eares to heare them, not eſtéeming them worthy of other affection: Séeing that of ſuch thinges we may make our ſeruice and ſolace without ielouſie to kéepe them, or compaſſion to loaſe them. Yea to make ſorowe for ſuch trifles, excedes the limits of an honorable Lady, &amp; is contrary to the office of a good Chriſtian. Wherein, if I were the iudge afore whom ſhould be debated the loue you beare to your little Dogge, and the tranſgreſſions of your life, ſure I could not but laugh at the follie of the one, and wéepe for the Offences of the other. It is Written that the great <hi>Alexander</hi> buried his horſe, the Emperour <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi> his Parrot, and Prince <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> made a graue for his Sparow. at whoſe obſequies he prayed, and cauſed the body to be embawmed. If you had hard or read of theſe, it may be by their example, you would haue built a a tombe for your little Dogge, although I accompt to worſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the teares you haue let fall for him, then the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and ceremonies which thoſe Pagans made for their dead beaſtes. And ſo good Madame, God giue you a ſpirite
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:2054:178"/>
to wéepe for your ſinnes, and a mind to leaue of to mouone for thinges vaine and tranſitory.</p>

And albeit amongeſt friendes there can not bée a more neceſſary action then to miniſter counſell, the ſame being the firſt effect of that fayth and vertue which ought to be conſidered in the election of friendes. Yet, to ſome men it is hatefull to be counſelled in thinges contrary to their will and affection, eſteming it better to dwell in the luſt of their particular deſires, then to be warned, euen as the miſerable patient findes it ſwéeter to giue libertie to his wound, then to ſuffer it to haue cure with a litle paine in the beginning.</p>
               <p>But, for my part, hauing ioyned alwayes our long friendſhip, an honeſt care of your weldoing: I can not hold my ſelfe diſcharged in office, if I debate not franckly the eſtate of your auncient abuſes, although there remaynes no expectation of other fruite then hapneth to the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, who comming to vncouer an olde wound long cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, ſéemes griuous to his patient. I perceiue by your
<pb facs="tcp:2054:179"/>
letter you are falen into a practiſe of new loues, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a new hurt to your olde wound, you ſéeme alſo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund a new remedie at my hand, as though I had the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, both to let bloud and cloſe vp the vaine. I would I were with you, for that hauing libertie to communicate, there may be many things ſpoken, which are not conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be written. But more do I wiſh that you would haue vſed me in an other office, ſince for matters of loue, you are not now in age to follow it, and much leſſe is it conſonant to my grauetie to giue you counſell, my habit, my authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, &amp; my place being all againſt it. It is not to you and me to whom it belongeth to ſolicite in loue, and much leſſe are we ſubiects wherin he takes his delites, grace &amp; recreation. For that you being loden with yeres, and I tied to my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, in you is expreſſed too great debilitie, and in me no leſſe want of libertie. Beleue not that your loue, is true loue, but rather ſorow, not ioy, but perplexitie, not delite, but torment: not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but griefe: not honeſt recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but very confuſion: Séeing that in him that is a louer, muſt be looked for, youth, libertie, and liberalitie. Straw that is rotten and become doung, is better to fat land, then to lay vppon a houſe: and in a bodie broken and aged, is more vſe and ſeruice of ſorowe and infirmities, then poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie to ſuffer, beare paſſion, and ſolicit in loue: For that to <hi>Cupid</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> are not acceptable any ſortes of people, but young men to ſerue them, ſuch as are liberall to ſpare for no coſt, patient to endure, diſcréete to ſpeake, ſecret to conceale, faythful to deſerue, and conſtant to continue to the end. It is a miſerie to be poore and proude, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengefull and dare not ſtrike, to be ſicke and farre from ſuccour, to be ſubiect to our enemies, and laſtly to ſuffer perill of life without refuge. But for an old man to bée in loue, is the greateſt wretchednes that can trauell the life of man: For, the pooreman ſometimes findeth pitie, but the old louer ſtandes alwayes reiected. The coward finds
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:2054:179"/>
friends to beare out his quarrels, but the amorous old man liues alwaies perſecuted with paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. He that is ſick liues vnder the climate of Gods prouidence, where the amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous old man is abandoned of all ſuccour. He that is ſubiect to his enemies, is not ſometimes without his ſeaſons of conſolation and quiet, where, to the old louer is no time of truce nor hope of reconcilement. Laſtly there is no peril of life ſo deſperate which may not be forſéene or ſuffred: where the eſtate of the amorous old man is ioyned alwayes to dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger. He is alwayes vexed with ſcornes of his Lady, defaced by his neighbours, robbed of his ſeruants, and ſeruiceable euen to the ſeaſons and appoyntments of Bawdes, who are not without their pouders whoſe propertie is to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his ſléepe on the night, and kéepe him ielouſe on the day, leading his minde in Ague fits, ſometimes hot and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times colde, ſometimes glad, and ſometimes ſorowfull, ſomeiimes doubtfull, and ſometimes aſſured, and alwaies in expectation but neuer ſatiſfied. By meane wherof I hold al the faculties and ſciences of the world poſſible to be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but the trade to loue, which <hi>Salomon</hi> was too ignorant to write, and <hi>Ouid</hi> not hable to ſet down in rule &amp; precept. For that it onely is a doctrine that ought to be drawne out of the ſchole of the hart, and guided by true and perfect diſcretion. There is nothing that more requireth gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then the practiſe of loue: ſéeing that in caſes of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, thirſt, cold, heat, and all other naturall influences, they may be referred to Paſſions ſenſible only to the body: But the follies and faultes that are done in loue, the hart is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to ſuffer, féele, and bewayle them, ſince loue, more then all other thinges naturall, retayneth alwayes this propertie, to exerciſe tirannie chiefely againſt the hartes of his ſubiects.</p>
               <p>The better to eſtabliſh ſtabilitie, aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; conſtancie, it behoueth ſuch as do loue to be equal: For, if ſhe be young &amp; he old, if he be priuate and ſhe a wanderer, if ſhe a nigard &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:2054:180"/>
he prodigall: If he ciuill, and ſhe rude: if ſhe diſcréete and he fooliſh: if laſtly he loue and ſhe hate: There is no doubt but vnperfect loues will reſolue into iarres, contencions, and continuall diſquiets. For that, where is not conformitie of condicion, there can bee no contented loue, no more then where is no true faith, can be no true operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of good life and maners. It is impoſſible to an old man and a louer to be without ſorow or ſuſpicion: For that ielouſie is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to loue as the Briare is to the Roſe, and paſſion follow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth olde age, as the ſhadowe doth the man. Why ſhould then a man of your age containing more then thréeſcore yeres, plucked with aches and pinched with the goute, ſéeke the company of a young, faire, and amorous Lady, who wil ſtudie more to plume vpon you, then to pleaſe you, eſteming you for no other vſe, then to miniſter to her wants, giue cool<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ler to hir lightnes, &amp; protect her abuſes? For, being not able to pleaſe hir eye, you muſt perfourme her prodigalities: and being impotent to delite her, your office muſt be to ſuffer an other to ſupplie that which you are not hable to ſatiſfie. Why deſire you the company of a friend, ſéeing betwene you and her can paſſe no other communitie or conuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then to read Ridles &amp; dreames, and tell tales, complayning that of the day you haue no ſtomacke to meate, and on the night you do nothing but accompt the houres, and exerciſe hateful to women, &amp; a cuſtome intollerable ſuch as haue bene enured to men of better complexion? Why ſéeke you a friend, ſéeing you haue no power to entertaine her, no pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to endure her, nor age to poſſeſſe her: For that amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt women this is infallibly obſerued, that if their friend bée poore, they diſdaine him, if he be waſpiſh they ſéeke to vex him further: and being old, they ſcorne their age, and ſéeke their recompence of others? What fruite looke you to drawe from a friend, ſéeing you are not hable to tell her in order the paſſions you endure for her, nor the felicities you wiſh to her: Al women for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt part enclining to this
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:2054:180"/>
glorie, to heare of the torments of their friendes, and to ſée their ſeruants labour to be ſeruiceable. How can you deſire the ſocietie of a friend, ſéeing, if you write not to her on the day, you are ſure to find her froward at night, and beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no preſent vppon her, ſhe will retorne recompence to your diſcontentment: For being not courted with ſonges and letters to extoll her beautie, and not viſited with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to pleaſe her ambicion: Oh it were more ſafe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde a Cockatrice, then hope for pitie in her face. Why deſire you a friend, ſéeing you muſt denie her nothing ſhée demaundes, nor miſlike with any diſpleaſure ſhée doth to you: For, women béeing denied (not conſidering their owne vnworthineſſe) conſter it to the deſpite of the partie for whom they prepare reuenge, And if you make not their diſpleaſure your felicitie, they will charge you with want of loue, and affront you with toyes to your perpetuall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet. Why kéepe you a friend, to whom you muſt not miniſter according to your port and hauiour, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to her follie and ambicion: For, a friend marcenarie in loue, is not ſubiect to allowance, and much leſſe regards the proporcion of him that entertayneth her, but béeing compounded vppon inſatiable humors, ſhée is neuer ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, till ſhée ſée him vtterly ſpoyled. Why require you a friend, ſéeing you muſt not fayle to thanke her for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours you receiue, and hold it a dutie to beare her diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: For, in them though there bée but litle merit, yet they looke for great recompence, and if they doe nothing but vex you, yet you muſt iudge all to the beſt, and take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to blame. Why ſeeke you a friend, ſéeing when ſhée flattreth you moſt, it is not to content you, but vnder this intencion to drawe ſomething from you: For, women to worke their deſires, can tourne them ſelues into ſo many ſubtelties and ſugred humilities, as the <hi>Camelion</hi> into cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, or the iugler into ſtraunge deuiſes to deceiue the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders.
<pb facs="tcp:2054:181"/>
And if you haue a friend, you muſt enforce your ſelfe to laugh euen when the dollors of your Goute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uokes you moſt to crie. And afore you haue had ful poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of her, ſhée will caſt you vp loden with ſorrowe, care, ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, and all other troubleſome infirmities, and for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence ioyne her ſelfe to an other with whom ſhée will laugh to ſée you poore, impotent, deceiued, and ſpoyled. And therefore to one of your age and ſubiection to ſickneſſe, it were better to delite in the conuerſation of ſome honeſt companion to cheriſh and recreate you, then in the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of a young Ladie to make your dayes troubleſome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Samocratius, Nigidius,</hi> and <hi>Ouid,</hi> haue written many volumes of the remedie of loue, wherein they rather taught remedie to others, then found any them ſelues, for that they all thrée died in perſecution, not for the abuſes they committed at <hi>Rome,</hi> but for the loues they practiſed at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pua.</hi> Let them ſay what they will, and ſurmiſe that beſt may pleaſe their fancie, but according to experience, the beſt remedie in loue, is to eſchew conuerſation, and auoyd occaſion: for that of many that follow him, there are fewe frée from his bondage, where ſuch as abandon him liue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in libertie. Take héede therefore you dwell not long in that temptation, ſéeing it is not conuenient for your ſoule, your bodie, your honour, nor profite of your houſe, aſſuring you that more ſhall you haſten your death by the perplexities of your Miſtreſſe, then by the torment or dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of the Goute.

Séeing the malice of men is ſo great, and the honour of women ſo delicate, that in often reſort the world takes occaſion to rayſe brutes, and their huſbandes not without aduauntage to bée diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.

               <p>I haue often delt with the Coronell to receiue your Nephew for his Liefetenant, and béeing ſo often denied, I take it for a diſcharge no more to trouble him: For, it is a hard thing to a liberall minde and a ſhamefaſt face, to bée a ſuter to him in whom is no merit to bée entreated, but ſpecially when hée tourneth our importunitie to his glory, and makes vs aſhamed of our requeſt: In which reſpect there is nothing in this worlde which I holde more deare, then that which is bought by ſute and requeſt: ſéeing
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:2054:182"/>
that more doth that man giue which for one hower employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſhame of his face, then another that for any other thing ſhall giue all his goodes: the ſame agréeing with the opinion of <hi>Plato,</hi> that as great is the contentment which a good harte taketh in giuing, as it is gréefe to him that entre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and is denyed: For that in giuing, the one buyeth the libertie of an other, and in receiuing, the other puttes in ſubiection himſelfe and all that he hath. Touching the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney you ſent me for your books, I haue retourned it againe by the bearer, praying you to thinke that the pleaſure which one friende doth for an other ought not to be payed wyth ready money, but wyth retribution of equall recompence or value: And by ſending to me ſo little money ſo farre of, the world may thinke, that eyther you ſuffer want of frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or in me is lacke of liberalitie. The frendſhippe groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon couetouſneſſe is ended by couetouſneſſe, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore amongeſt true friendes, there ought to be no ende in friendſhippe, nor limit in liberalitie.

Séeing that in whom is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolement of tongue, nor brydle to reſtrayne their ſelfe wil, in them is for the moſt parte ſufficient occaſion to trouble whole Common Weales where they dwell, and to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to bring no ſmall contention. Yea, there cannot be a greater diſgrace in a man, then to be diſcontented in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: For albeit no man in this worlde can liue contented on all partes, yet, we may eyther quite exempt our ſelues, or at leaſt auoyde many of thoſe troubles and diſpleaſures which of our ſelues we ſearche. There be many people of this nature, not onely not to eſchew harmes and inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, but alſo will put wynges to their fortune, and runne to ſéeke them afore they be ready to happen. More is the neceſſitie of induſtrie to reſtraine and ſtay ſuch men

from doing harme to themſelues, then for auoyding hurt to others. Of that ſort of men is the Biſhop of <hi>T.</hi> who beareth his great affaires, as the Sumpterhorſe doth his burthen, who whyleſt it is in laying on his backe ſtandeth ſtill and ſturreth not, but if you offer to take it of, he yearkes and flinges as though there were perill towardes him.

The vertue of patience is no other thing, then a hart martired in ſorrows and paſſions,<note place="margin">The vertue of patience.</note> expreſſing notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in his outwarde actions, a ſpirite of contentment and gladnes, and not onely beareth his preſent perplexities, but alſo is prepared to the paſſion of al ſuch as may happen: of this ſort was the patience of <hi>Tobias</hi> &amp; <hi>Job,</hi> in whom much leſſe that there could be diſcouered any eſtat or ſhew of their griefes, but as true examples of patience, ſeemed to take pleaſure in their aduerſities, euen as the <hi>Salimander</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyts to bath his limmes amid the flames of moſt whot bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fyre. The vertue of conſtancie is then declared,<note place="margin">The vertue of conſtancie.</note> when a man neyther by trouble, diſgrace, or miſfortune chaung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not his hearte from the deuotion and buſineſſe he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, as was expreſſed in the perſeueraunce of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pye <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in <hi>Egipt,</hi> and the aſſuraunce of that affable <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> in the Deſart, In whom the offer of Beautie and what elſe appertayneth to the ſwéete deſires of the fleſhe, had no power of Temptation in the one: nor in the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinie and murmure of ſo many factious people, was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilytie to wythdraw the other from the ſeruice he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto. That is true Magnanimitie, when the harte of one man alone dare enterpriſe vppon graue thinges both daungerous to beginne, and very harde to execute:<note place="margin">Magnanimitie.</note> the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of this vertue was well expreſſed in the Prophete <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> when he aſſayled and vanquiſhed the <hi>Gyant,</hi> and in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyas</hi> when he roaſe to confounde <hi>Jezabell,</hi>
               </p>

is ioyned to that man, who ſéekes not nor will not render ill for ill, no not ſo much as to recompence a wrong recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, wyth iniuries or vyle wordes, according to the myld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Micheas,</hi> who ſuffering an outrage of a blow on the eare, the iniurie was afterwardes reuenged by a Dog. The vertue of long ſufferance appeareth in that man,<note place="margin">Long ſuffering</note> that is neyther wearie nor vexed, though his troubles and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities encreaſe, and his helpes and remedies diminiſhe &amp; are far of: according to the experience &amp; teſtimonie of <hi>S. Paule,</hi> who was trauelled with many malices &amp; dangers in the worlde and that for many yeares. The vertue of méekeneſſe,<note place="margin">Humilitie.</note> or humilitie, followeth that man whoſe harte is reſolued into ſuch tranquility, that he is not mooued for any iniurie he heareth, and much leſſe diſquieted for any vice he ſéeth. Wyth this vertue was endued the holy man <hi>S. John Euangelist,</hi> in whoſe humilytie and myldneſſe of minde, is an example to all Chriſtians to yéelde to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities that the enemies of God impoſe vppon them, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for that comfort and rewarde which that holy man did fynde.<note place="margin">The vertue of force.</note> This is a true effect of the vertue of force, when a man ſtands ſo reſolute and valiant in mind, that neyther by Temptation he waxeth weake, nor by importunitie of trauell, he forbeareth to doe good: Of this vertue were notable and holy examples <hi>S. Anthony,</hi> and <hi>S. Hillary,</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering great Temptations in the Deſert, and yet not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing euen there to doe great ſeruices to God. But for that our principall intention is, to entreate of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of perſeuerance, adioyning wyth all, what neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we haue of the vertue of force, it is not impertinent that we touch ſomewhat the opinions of the Philoſophers, and alſo what the holy Fathers thought particularly of it. <hi>S. Augustine</hi> ſayth, that no other thing is the vertue of force, then a Burning and vehement affection trauelling a frée and liberall minde, paſſible to all thinges, whether their qualetie be harde or eaſie, vntill he attayne to that he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:2054:184"/>
or poſſeſſe the thinges whereon he hath fixed his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and zeale. <hi>Cicero,</hi> ſpeaking of force, attributed firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and conſtancie to no other thing, then a determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a valiant minde, who diſſembleth that which he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and ſuffereth thinges that he would not. <hi>Macrobus</hi> referreth to no other thing the vertue of force, then to the harte of a man Heroycall and valiant, whom proſperitie cannot rayſe into wéening or fircenes, nor aduerſitie makes weake or faynt in courage. <hi>Aristotle</hi> giues this iudgment of the vertue of force, that it is a certayne ſtrength and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of a mynde reſolute,<note place="margin">Aduerſity is no other thing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the rewarde of ſome dishoneſt act.</note> which eſtéemeth aduerſitie to bée no other thing, then the ſtipende and recompence of ſome diſhoneſt act. <hi>Lucius Senequa,</hi> attributes ſo much to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of a man hardy and valiant, that he makes it more eaſie to take a Cytie well garded, then to vanquiſh a minde enuironed wyth force and vertue. <hi>Saynt Hierome</hi> ſayth, that no other thing is the diſcourſe of this lyfe, then a high and publyke way, on whoſe right hande marcheth the valyant and hardy man, on the left part, the coward and faynt har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and betwéene them, goeth he that we call ſtrong and reſolute. <hi>Plato</hi> is of opinion that the prerogatiues of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie and force, are to moderate anger wyth méekeneſſe, malice wyth loue, aduerſitie wyth perſeuerance, and feare wyth patience. <hi>S. Gregory</hi> referreth the vertue and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of conſtancie and force, to vanquiſhe the fleſhe, to reſiſt appetytes, to diſpiſe delytes, to affect thinges of hard enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, and not to eſchew thoſe that are perillous and payne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. So great is the qualetie of this vertue of force, that it is neceſſary to all the other vertues: For, if it miniſter not to iuſtice, Temperance, Chaſtetie, and wiſedome to come to their endes, they would eaſely loaſe their operation, and ſuffer conuerſion. So that to enterpriſe any good worke, wiſedome is neceſſary for the beginning, diſcretion to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and guide it, and conſtancie to bring it to execution. The good lucke and felicitie of the good <hi>Pilot</hi> conſiſtes not
<pb facs="tcp:2054:185"/>
altogether to guyd well the Helme, but rather that he bring it to aryue ſafe at the Hauen. Euen ſo Ieſus Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſeth not the Kyngdome of Heauen to ſuch onely as are Baptized, nor to him that is called a Chriſtian, and muche leſſe to any that for a tyme doth the Woorkes of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, if he perſeuere not in his Seruice. For, the Crowne of Tryumphe, is not beſtowed vppon him that goeth to the Warres, but is worthely reſerued for ſuche as obtayne the victorye. Euen as in the lyke reſemblaunce, it is a vayne Labour to the Huſbandman to manure and ſowe his Lande, if afterwardes eyther for feare to be tyered, or in doubt to be made wearie wyth trauell, he forbeare to labor in Harueſt, and forgetteth to bring his Corne home to the Barne. Lykewyſe if a Poore man making ſome voyage, and doubting to fynde the way harde, or vneaſie, or his Iourney long, retourneth, géeuing ouer that hée hath begone: Let him aſſuredly looke to loaſe that hee hath ſpent, and wythall to forgoe the purpoſe and expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his Trauayle. Hée that Laboureth by the daye, is not payed his hyer for that hée brynges onely his Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocke into the Garden, but workyng from Morning till night, hée is woorthye of his Wages and hath it. The wyfe of <hi>Loth</hi> was tranſformed into an Image or ſtoane of Salt, for that ſhée tourned her heade to looke backe to <hi>Sodome</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the Commaundement of God, ſaying, <hi>Goe alwayes furth right without loking backe</hi>: The ſame being an example and doctrine to inſtruct vs how wretched the worlde is, and hauing once forſaken it, wée ought not ſo much as once Looke backe to it, and muche leſſe reappoſe Confydence in it.</p>
               <p>Great was the conſtancie of <hi>Moyſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> in not condiſcending to the Requeſtes, Preſentes, and Threates, which the great Kynge <hi>Pharao</hi> practiſed, to haue them abyde in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and not to drawe from thence the People of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> wyth whom I agrée, that in caſes to retourne to the worlde,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:2054:185"/>
and giue ouer any good thing that we haue begon, we ought to reiect the prayers of our frendes, and much leſſe to be moued wyth any other temptation. Of this is a good example <hi>Ioſeph</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Jacob,</hi> who being ſolde into <hi>Egipt,</hi> and in great opportunitie to poſſeſſe the beautie of the queene, would not for all that defyle his conſcience, but had regard to his conſtancie, and bare care to the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his maſter. By his example let vs be warned that greater neceſſity haue we of reſolute minds to reſiſt vices and preſent ſinnes, together with the offers and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are miniſtred, then to repulſe or defende an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie that aſſayleth vs. Many were the perſwaſions of the Bretherne of <hi>Dauid,</hi> to haue the kinge to retourne to his howſe and goe no more to the Warres, but muche leſſe that their importunities were ſufficient to make him giue ouer Armes, ſéeing he redoubled his courage, and eftſoones aſſailed the great <hi>Goliath</hi>: Géeuing vs to know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that wée ought rather to loaſe the liues that wée haue, then to leaue of the good wée haue béegonne. Muche was eſtéemed the Conſtancie of <hi>Nehemias</hi> and <hi>Eſdras,</hi> in the Buylding of the Temple which they made at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> in which worke many threatened them, they ſuffered ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny paſſions of iniuries, and were by many wayes dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded from their enterpriſe. Wherefore let the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt of god hold it for a ſigne that he doth then ſome good worke, when the wycked wythſtande or contende agaynſt him. Great was the Conſtancie of <hi>Mardocheas</hi> vnckle to the Quéene <hi>Hester,</hi> when he could not be brought to doe worſhip nor any humylity to proud <hi>Hama<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> a grauer of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, &amp; great enemy to the <hi>Hebrues</hi>: by whoſe examples we are taught that it belongs to vs to eſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge our ſelues alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither from thoſe men, that diſwade vs from our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; inuite vs to ſinne: No leſſe was the conſtancy of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly woman <hi>Suſanna</hi> in diſobeying the wicked iudges, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her to defile mariage, and conſent to thir curſed luſte.
<pb facs="tcp:2054:186"/>
Whoſe vertue may ſerue as a doctrine to all Chriſtians, that neyther for feare of Puniſhment nor by force, none ought to commit any great tranſgreſſion, ſéeing God kéeps a garde and reckoning aſwell of our honor as our lyfe, and is as ready for our defence as he was to preſerue the chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetie of <hi>Suſanna.</hi> All theſe examples I thought not amiſſe to reduce into diſcourſe, to the ende that good men might ſtriue ſtill to purſue the ſeruice of the Lorde, and the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked be afryayde to tourne backe: Wherein let all men hold this for a fayth and law infallible, that the Lorde neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth him that ſerueth him, and much leſſe is farre from thoſe that follow him, according to his prouidence ouer the Prophet <hi>Daniell,</hi> who being out of his Countrey, and by the ſentence of tyrantes throwne into the Denne of Lyons, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned of all ſuccour of men, was not forgot of the Lord, who ſent his Prophete <hi>Abacuke,</hi> not onely to viſit him, but alſo to comfort and refreſhe him wyth meate. By this alſo we may inferre, that if we forget not to ſerue God, he will not forget to miniſter remedy to our diſtreſſes, as knowing right well the little we haue, and the leſſe we canne doe. And therefore let vs not giue ouer to Serue him, and much leſſe forbeare to folow him, ſéeing he doth Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate wyth all men, that if in his Seruice they doe that which they may, he will recompence them with the effect of all their deſires. So that, how lame, weake or frayle ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we be, we ought not (in the action of Gods ſeruice) ſay, <hi>We can not, and therefore wee will not.</hi> For that we haue a Lorde ſo good and eaſie to content, that he takes vs not as we are, but hath reſpect to that we deſire to be.</p>
               <p>Agréeable to theſe, <hi>S. Barnard</hi> vſeth this text. <hi>Debilis est hostis, qui non vincit niſi volentem,</hi> as if he had ſayde, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill of his nature is weake, and the Lorde holdes him ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned and vnhable, that he hath no power to vanquiſhe any, but ſuch as cannot reſiſt him. At the Gates of the hart of a Chriſtian knocketh Ieſus Chriſt, and alſo knocketh the Diuell and offereth to enter, ſo that in that caſe, we cannot
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:2054:186"/>
deny, that it is not in our hande to receiue the one, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reiect the other: And therefore neyther hath the Diuell any prerogatiue to enter one houſe vnleſſe we admit him, nor the ſpirite of God doth depart out of our harte, if our ſelues make not the way for him: O miſerable man, what ſhall become of thée, when the Lorde calles thee to recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſaying he hath entreated thée, and thou haſt not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him: He hath admoniſhed thée &amp; thou haſt not bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued him: he hath called thée, but thou haſt not aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: he hath ſpoken to thée but thou haſt not knowne him: Yea he hath touched thée, but thou haſt not felt him. God, ſpeaking to <hi>Dauid</hi> (as he was wont to communicate with his friendes and ſeruauntes) ſayth: I holde not ſo great a care ouer my Elect, when they eate, when they ſléepe, or in their other actions: as when they ſigh and wéepe: Yea, if they will call vppon me in their tribulations, and ſomwhat attende me, I will draw them out of their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, not onely comforted, but alſo to their honour and Eſtimation: Wherein wée haue reaſon to know that God loueth vs aboue all others, ſéeing hee byndes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to doe more for vs then all the worlde agayne. For, according to the propertie of the worlde: our frindes helpe vs to ſpende the goodes we haue gotten, where the Lorde aydes vs to beare the trauelles we ſuffer. And therefore the ſeruaunt of God ought to conſider, that when Ieſus Chriſt ſayth, <hi>Beati qui lugent quoniam ipſi conſolabuntur.</hi> He eſtabliſheth not a happineſſe and felicitie onely in that men wéepe and mourne, but referreth it to conſolation, that they exſpect of their teares. So that to the wiſe and good Chriſtian, it is not ſo much to beholde the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which of the enmie he ſuffereth, as to conſider the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence which of the Lord he expectes. The ſimple huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, when the ſeaſon and the weather agrée, is not affrayde to caſt his ſéede into the duſt of the earth recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the encreaſe to the Lord, and dare not true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb facs="tcp:2054:187"/>
commit their eſtate to the hands of God their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in whom remains the euerlaſting prouidence ouer all. And ſéeing he is the trueth wherein men ought to beléeue, and the lyfe in whom we ought to liue, and laſtly the way by the which we ought to walke, he inuiteth vs thereby to belieue him, and ſo to poſſeſſe our deſires: to liue in him, to the end we may be made happy by the benefite of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: and laſtly to walke in his wayes to the end he may guide vs, and if we ſtumble or fall, he may lende vs his hande eftſoones to remount vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Non ſumus ſufficientes cogitare aliquid ex nobis, tanquam ex nobis, ſed ſufficientia nostra ex deo est.</hi> We haue no licence ſaith <hi>S. Paule,</hi> to thinke or preſume any thing of our ſelues, and much leſſe ſufficient by our induſtry onely to doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good work. But this ought rather to be our beliefe, that if we doe or know to doe any good, we haue power therun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the grace of God: like as alſo if we erre in any thing, it comes for that we hauing forgot God, he forgets vs and tournes vs ouer to our proper errors. And therefore, that Chriſtian, that beginneth any thing in confidence of his proper force or power, hath great reaſon to liue in ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of himſelfe, and ſet good garde of his doings: for though it be in the cunning of men to giue the battell, it reſteth onely in the wiſedome of God to diſpoſe the victory. So, that who determineth to ſerue God, and vnfaynedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe confidence in him, hath no neceſſitie nor reaſon of feare of himſelfe, or to be hurt by any other: For that, ſo great a prouidence hath god ouer his ſeruants, that though he ſuffer them to be tempted, yet he conſenteth not that they be vanquiſhed, if it be not of their proper will. The Diuell obteined licence of God to tempt <hi>Iob,</hi> but it was giuen him vnder this condition, that though he afflicted his body, yet he ſhould not touch his ſoule: Whereby we may note, that our Lorde ſhewed not ſo much the loue he beareth to his ſeruauntes in taking from them their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:2054:187"/>
and trauelles, but rather in deuiding them farre from ſinnes. In like ſort the Diuell gat leaue to deceiue the wretched <hi>Achab,</hi> by the meane &amp; induſtry of falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes: In which two examples, we may ſée what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is vſed betwéene the frendes and enemies of God: ſéeing to ſuch as ſerue him, he ſuffereth that they be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted onely, but to thoſe that offende him, he giueth leaue that they be beguyled. Graunt therefore Oh good Ieſu and loue of our ſoules, that we may rather be tempted, troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, perſecuted, and vexed with the happy man <hi>Iob,</hi> then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled, vanquiſhed, and abandoned as was the wretched king <hi>Achab.</hi> If it be familiar to the men of the worlde to paſſe from place to place at their pleaſure vnder protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſafe conduit, In greater aſſurance doe walke all ſuch as loue and ſerue God. For that he hath promiſed by his Prophete <hi>Micheas,</hi> that who ſhall lay handes vppon any one of his Elect, ſhall touch euen the Apple of his eye, kéeping ſuch a mercifull prouidence ouer them, that if he ſuffer them to ſlyde into ſinne, he is ready forthwyth to miniſter his grace. And therefore ſuch deſerue not to be called Chriſtians, and much leſſe to beare eſtimation in the miniſtery, who forbeare to ſerue the Lord for feare to be tempted, or that they doubt of his ſuccours, ſéeing (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the teſtimony of <hi>Dauid</hi>) God beares to his cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen ſuch property of affection, that he pitcheth his Tentes rounde about them to defende them, his eares are open to heare them if they appeale to him in their aduerſities, and he accompanieth them wyth his holy Aungell, to the end they erre not, he beholdeth the calamities they endure, and yéeldes compaſſion to the complayntes they make, accordinh to the comfort of the Pſalme, <hi>O culi domini ſuper iustos, et aures eius ad praeces eorum.</hi>

Great is the comfort of ſuche as are come into Religion guyded by the hande of God, ſéeing it is aduouched in the Scriptures that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt led Ieſus into the Deſart, and the wicked ſpirite caried him vp to the Temple, not with intention that hée ſhould Preache, but rather to throw himſelfe headlong from the place.

you in the height of my glory, to the ende you may there haue the fruition of my Diuinitie. This truly is a moſt highe and great miſtery for the Apoſtles, to follow Ieſus Chriſt, hauing abandoned parentes and friendes, countrey and goods, yea, &amp; renounced their proper willes: God thought them not worthie of recompence ſo much for that, as for that they perſeuered till the ende: he ſayth not to his Diſciples, you are onely they that are tempted, but you haue remayned wyth me in my temptations. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he giues vs to know that in the other worlde none ſhall haue place at the table of God, but ſuch as perſeuere in him to the end.

               <p>You aſke whereuppon it commeth that oftentimes we ſhrinke and enter into a cold, after we be deliuered of our vrine. The reaſon is this: ſo long as the vrine being hot, remayneth yet in the bladder, neither the bladder nor the partes about it, can féele any cold, but the bladder béeing diſcharged, all the ſayd partes are eftſones filled with an aire more colde then was the vrine (for there is nothing voide in nature.) And that aire occupying the place of the vrine, cauſeth naturally the ſhiuering and cold that wée feele.

The ſame béeing the cauſe, that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing warmth by litle and litle, the heat within comes out &amp; is not hindred by the cold, which cauſeth the leſſe ſence or féeling of paine.

ſet himſelfe to behold or ſtare much vppon another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſturring his eye of long, ſuch one is not farre from death. If a man be ſicke of a Feuer collerike or ſharp, and his pulſe moue vncertainely, ſometimes quicke and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſlow, ſuch one no doubt enclines to death. Who is ſicke of a burning Feuer, and vſeth ſometimes to draw vp the ſhéete, or double y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cloathes of the bed, or plucke of the thrumbes of the ſame, in that man is great coniecture of the end of his lyfe.

and pollitike wits, Captaines well experienced, ſouldiers ſeruiceable and valiant, and Armies compounded vpon great nombers of men: It would be an eaſie matter to bring all theſe to the warres.

How is it poſſible you ſhould preſcribe rules to ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, ſéeing you make no conſcience to breake the lawes of your predeceſſors? and no more ought you to correct o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that ſuffer ſo many vices in your ſelues, then it is méete that the lame man take him that is blind to leade him.

that you made it lawfull for all men to rob, to kill, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quere and to ſpoyle, and following the generall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world farre deuided from the loue of God and good pollicie, you ſet mens mindes at libertie euery one to take what he could, and kill whom he would: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto this intollerable inconuenience is adioyned, that to al theſe grieuous euils that are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted daily, neither thoſe that gouerne wil giue remedie, nor ſuch as are vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed dare complaine.

               <p>Hauing made vs ſubiect to your obedience, it is withall good reaſon you kéepe vs in iuſtice, and miniſter to our countrey peace and tranquilitie. But alas it is all in the contrary, ſéeing ſuch as you ſend to vs do nothing but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſh our goods, and the Senate here robbeth vs of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noume, ſaying, that ſince we are a nation without lawes, without reaſon, &amp; without a king, we deſerue not to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwaies reputed &amp; vſed then ſlaues, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of people barbarous vnknowne.

bloud through out all the world. Where you ſay we deſerue no better then ſlaues, for that we haue no Prince to commaund vs, no Senate or councel to gouern vs, nor armies to defend vs: I may anſwere, that ſeeing we had no enemies to anoy vs, we liued without care to arearearmies: euery one being contented with his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion and fortune, there was no neceſſitie of a proud Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to decide our controuerſies: And being as we were, popular, and equal, why ſhould we conſent to haue Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to whoſe office it appertayneth chiefely to ſuppreſſe tirants, and ſuffer thoſe people that liue in peace and tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilitie. And where you ſay that our countrey had no fourme of common weale nor pollicie, but that we paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a conuerſation like brute beaſtes in mountaines and Caues: You are in this as well as in the reſt farre de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, for that wée neuer ſuffred in our countrey any that practiſed vntruthes, mutinies, or factions, and much leſſe could we endure any that brought fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtrange countreys, garments or other wares to make vs proud or effeminate, but béeing modeſt in attire, wée were alſo temperate in diet without expectation of better entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.

                  <pb facs="tcp:2054:208"/>And therefore to the pollicie of <hi>Rome</hi> which is rich, we owe pitie and compaſſion, and to the gouernement of <hi>Germany</hi> becauſe it is poore, you ought to beare iuſtice with fauor: Wherin if the ſame contentment which we brooke in our pouertie, had alſo remayned to you in your wealth and aboundance, we had bene without cauſe to complaine, &amp; you without ſpot or blame of conſcience.</p>
               <p>I haue yet many things to ſay, which in this perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of mind, I haue no feare to ſpeake, ſince you had no ſhame to do them, for that a fault publike muſt not ſuffer ſecret correction.<note place="margin">A publike fault muſt not ſuffer a ſecret puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Did it not ſuffice you to take from vs our auncient libertie, and to ouerwhelme vs with intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable ſubſidies and payments, but the more to entangle vs with all kindes of miſeries, you ſend vs officers ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous that they are all tranſformed into priuate gaine, and iudges ſo ignorant that they are not hable to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend our ſtatutes, nor make vs vnderſtand your lawes.

If we be diſobedient, or that you ſuſpect our loyaltie or ſeruice, procéede to the diſpatch of our liues, to the end we may be deliuered of paine, and you liue without ielouſie, aſſuring you that your ſwordes can not be more cruell in our bodies, then are your tirannies in our hartes. If you lay thus many burdens vpon vs for our children, loade them with Irons and take them as ſlaues, becauſe you can lay no more on them then they can beare, but of commaundements and tributs you haue giuen vs more then we can ſuffer: if you do it for our goods, we giue you libertie to take al, for that

we haue not your condicion to delite to liue poorely, for feare we ſhould not die rich. Oh to what extremetie hath your tirannies brought vs: ſeeing all the remainder of our miſerable nation haue ſworne together, neuer to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company with our wiues, and to kill our proper children the rather to deliuer them of your cruelties. And therfore holding it more honorable that they die with libertie, then to liue in ſeruitude and captiuitie, we haue deſperately determined to ſuffer from henceforth the violent moci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and furies of the fleſh, and ſo to ſequeſter our ſelues from the vſe of our wiues to the end they may be barren, thinking it better to liue continent for twentie or thirtie yeres, (the reſidue of our time here) then to leaue to our children an inheritance of perpetuall ſlauerie. For, if they haue to ſuffer, thoſe calamities which their ſorowfull fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue endured, it were not only good not to let them liue, but w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>al it were better to conſent not to haue them borne. The land that is conquered by force, ought to be gouerned with more clemencie and mildnes, for that thoſe that are miſerable captiues, when they ſée fauora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble iuſtice adminiſtred, they will both forget the tirannie paſt, and better prepare their hartes to the perpetual ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude: which if it be ſo, why do your officers in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi> driue vs to complaine, and your Senate at <hi>Rome</hi> ſo ſlowe to giue remedie, that afore you will admit an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the queſtion, the whole common weale ſuffreth daunger. If a poore man come to demaund iuſtice, and haue no bribes of gold, ſiluer, wine, purple, and other precious thinges to diſperſe. At the beginning he ſhalbe entertained to ſpend al that he hath, through a vaine hope to obtaine his cauſe. And being entred, they conſume him by delayes, and whileſt he hath meanes to beare out the charges of the ſute, they aſſure him that he hath good right, but when his liberalitie faileth, they pronounce ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt him, and ſo where he came to complaine

but of one, he returneth accurſing all, crying to the Gods for iuſtice and pitie. I will diſcloſe ſome part of my life the better to make you ſée the calamities of my poore countreymen.</p>
               <p>I liue by Acornes in Winter, and fiſh in Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, ſometimes bearing of burdens, and ſometimes digging vp of wylde Rootes, and that more for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie then paſtime, paſſing the moſt part of my miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time amongeſt the mountaynes, voyd of the comfort of my Wyfe, and company of my friendes, and not for other reaſon then to kéepe myne eyes from the view of ſo many murders of good men, ſo many oppreſſions of the poore and innocent, and ſo many other calamities afflicting my poore Countrey, that neither finding iuſtice there, nor hope of redreſſe in this Senate, I am entred into this baniſhment from the ſocietie of my houſe and comfort, deliting more to wander alone through the wooddes and valleys deſert, then to be made ſorowfull alwayes with the ſighes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and lamentations of my neighbours: For, being a borderer in the Forreſts and wooddes, the wild beaſtes forbeare to hurt me, if I refuſe to do them harme, where the <hi>Romanes</hi> in my countrey, although I do them ſeruice, yet will they not ſpare to torment me. It is no doubt a great perplexitie to endure a chaunge of fortune, but farre more intollerable is the griefe, when the paine is felt and can not bée remedied: ſo that great is my euill, when my deſtruction is ſubiect to ſuch a remedie, as ſuch as can helpe mée, will not, and thoſe that would, can not.</p>
               <p>Oh, it is time you had ſome ſence of the miſeries wée féele, ſeeing that if in reducing them thus to memory, my tongue faynteth, my eyes growe dimme, my hart vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth, and my fleſh trembleth: Much more grieuous is it
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:2054:209"/>
to ſée them in my countrey, to heare them with mine eares, to touch them with my finger, and to taſt them in my hart: yea the iniquitie of your iudges is ſo great, and the iuſtice of this Senate ſo partiall, that it exceedes the facultie of fleſh and bloud to endure the one, and is hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to all good men to heare of the other. And therefore in the accompt of all that I haue ſayd I growe to this concluſion, that one of theſe two thinges are to bée done, eyther to chaſtice me if I haue lied, or, if I haue told truth, you to bee depriued of your offices, wherein for my part, if you thinke my tongue hath taken an vnlawfull libertie to publiſh the roundnes and ſimplicitie of my hart, I ſtretch out my ſelfe afore you in this place, and do offer my head to the Axe, aſſuring my ſelfe of more honour by my death, then you can merit fame or renoume by ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſo many miſeries to my wretched life. Here the ſauage man gaue <gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to his Oration, leauing the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in ſuch remorſe for the oppreſſions of <hi>Germany,</hi> that the next daye they eſtabliſhed other Iudges ouer that part vppon <hi>Daunby,</hi> and procéeded to puniſh the corruption of others for peruerting ſo noble a common weale.</p>
               <p>Beholde here (ſir) what holineſſe flowed out of the mouth of an Ethnike, from whom I wiſhe you wyth other iudges mercenary as you are, to fetch your directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to reforme the Prouinces committed to your go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, and with all to diſcouer the ſubtilties, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and iniquities of inferior officers ſubſiſting in Cities and common weales. For, who would ſet him downe to deſcribe faythfully the deceites, the delayes, the perplexities, and daungerous ends of ſutes, he ſhould find it a ſubiect not to be writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with inke but with blood: ſéeing if euery ſuter ſuffred as much for the holy faith of Chriſt, as he endureth about the trauell of his proceſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:2054:210"/>
there would be as many martirs in chaunceries, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courtes of iuſtice and record of Princes, as was at <hi>Rome</hi> in the times of perſecution by the old Emperours: ſo that as to begin a proceſſe at this day, is no other thing then to prepare ſorow to his hart, complaintes to his tongue, teares to his eyes, trauaile to his féete, expenſes to his purſe, toyle to his men, triall of his friendes, and to all the reſt of his body nothing but paine and trauell. So, the effects and condicions of a proceſſe are no other, then of a rich man to become poore: of a ſpirite pleaſant to ſettle into malencholly: of a frée mind to become bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de from liberalitie, to fall to couetouſnes: from truth to learne falſehode and ſhiftes: and of a quiet man, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a vexer of others. So that I ſée no other difference betwene the ten plagues that ſcourged <hi>Egipt,</hi> and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries that afflict ſuters, then that the calamities of the one were inflicted by Gods prouidence, and the torments of the other are inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the malice of of men, who by their proper toyle, make themſelues very Martirs.</p>
