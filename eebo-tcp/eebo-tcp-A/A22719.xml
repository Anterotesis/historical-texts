         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN OVERTVRE AND EXPLANATI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the purport and vſe of this OFFICE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irſt, it is to be vnder ſtood that this Office to be knowne and called by the name of <hi>The publique Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter for generall Commerce,</hi> is indeed but the very reſemblance of a
<pb facs="tcp:5850:13"/>
publique Market, whereunto all men may freely repaire, and reſort to Trade and Traffique, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint or reſtraint, at their owne wils and pleaſures. And as in Markets many Commodities are ſolde and met withall more eaſily, and better cheape in one ſelfe place, then by ſeeking vp and downe the Countrey for them with m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re trouble, and at dearer rates in ſeuerall places: ſo is it by the vſe and benefite of this Office, which as a publique Market, is ſolely in his Maieſties power to authoriſe and priuiledge.</p>
            <p>Secondly this publique Market is a place which all men may eaſily finde out and freely repaire vnto, for ſpeedy meanes of helpe vpon any extremity
<pb facs="tcp:5850:13"/>
of for feitures of bondes or counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds, or danger of morgages of landes or goods by breach of d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yes, when they know not ſuddenly where to prouide themſelues of moneyes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon good ſecurity; for that euery man (eſpecially thoſe that dwell in remote ſhteres) is not acquainted with a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, nor knowes aſſuredly where to finde one to ſerue his turne vpon ſuch vrgent occaſion, or if he doe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it will be at a deare rate: which defect this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter ſhall be able to ſupply with very conſcionable and moderate conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; taking nothing of any, but what the parties themſelues ſhall in reaſon thinke fit and competent for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of their turnes, by the trauell of the Officers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5850:14"/>
Thirdly, by inſtance to make it more plaine, ſuch men as haue monies ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by them, that they would expoſe after eight, nine, or ten in the hundred may, if they pleaſe, make it knowne &amp; haue it regiſtred in this Office, wherby ſuch as repaire vnto this Regiſter to borrow, may alſo receiue notice &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection accordingly for ſuch ſummes as they deſire by aſ signment from the Officers, if the ſecurity be good and liked of.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, by way of example alſo to expreſſe the vſe and benefite of this Office for <hi>Buying and Selling:</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that one hath lands or a houſe in Wilt-ſhiere that he would gladly ſell, ſuddenly to raiſe monies, without too
<pb facs="tcp:5850:14"/>
great loſſe, but knows not how to make it generally knowne to the world; and that there are ſome others as deſirous to buy lands or a houſe in that ſhire at a reaſonable rate, and cannot learne nor get knowledge of any ſuch; yet by recourſe to this Register they may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily informe themſelues, and haue mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall intelligence of one anothers mindes perfectly, and readily, albeit they dwell farre aſunder; wher as now many times both parties are in care and cannot ſerue their turnes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, vndergoing thereby much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience, which this Office with great eaſe doth remedie.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, the parties themſelues that do either lend or borrow, buy or ſell, may
<pb facs="tcp:5850:15"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe it with as great ſecurity &amp; ſecrecy as they ſhall thinke fit by vſing other mens names then their owne, other places then their owne houſes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther friends or Factors for themſelues if they be ſo diſpoſed. So as by this free, plaine and eaſie courſe all men may reſt ſatisfied, that there is no cunning intent by meanes of this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to defraude men, nor by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice thereof to diſcouer mens wealths or ſecret estates, further then to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſhall ſeeme good.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, it is neyther deſired nor meant that any ſhould leaue their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes or goods that they would lend or ſell, in the charge or cuſtody of this Office, but in ſuch places as the owners
<pb facs="tcp:5850:15"/>
themſelues ſhall thinke most ſafe and conuenient; wherby ſuch as would borrow or buy, may (if they pleaſe) by this Regiſter be directed to thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or perſons that would Lend or Sell to ſerue their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urns mutually. And by this courſe all men may reſt ſecure of the integritie and faire dealings that ſhall bee vſed concerning other mens monies and goods; which the Patentees ſe ek not to haue the cuſtody or expoſing of for their priuate profit, but will rather auoide the accidents and dangers of ſuch hazards, and loſſes, as might happen in ſo great a charge, by miſ-reckoning, robbing, or many other waies, which we ſee ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten happens vnto men in their owne priuate houſes. And ſuch a misfortune
<pb facs="tcp:5850:16"/>
might be both a diſparagement to our credits by wrong conſtructions, and alſo a taxe and preiudice to the proceeding and reputation of this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice (which conſiſting meerely of the good opinion of the world for the iuſt dealing to be vſed therein) if it be found contrarie or corrupt, it cannot ſubſiſt, but will die in it ſelfe as vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.</p>
            <p>Moreouer wheras manymen dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling far from London, are now infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to repaire thither, to their great trauaile &amp; charge to ſerue their turn; many waiesin theſe forenamed kinds; by the benefite and vſe of this Office they ſhall be much eaſed. For it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended (by the fauour of God) that in
<pb facs="tcp:5850:16"/>
ſeuerall places of this Realme this publique Regiſter ſhalbe kept in ſome ſuch chiefe Cities or Townes as ſhall bee found moſt conuenient to ſerue the Countries next about them in theſe affaires, and to holde correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency with the Citie of London.</p>
            <p>Againe, it is very certaine that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers landes, leaſes, houſes, woods and chattels, which haue beene ſolde pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately at very low rates, to the no lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle loſſe of the owners, would haue bin purchaſed at more indifferent prices, if they had bin more publiquely kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen: for it often falleth out, that thoſe who would gladly buy ſuch, do ſeldome or neuer get knowledge of the Sellers intent, till the things deſired be paſt
<pb facs="tcp:5850:17"/>
recouery, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o the preiudice of both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: which defect this publique Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter will be a great meanes to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, there are a world of extraordinarie things, which are but few mens monies, and the owners themſelues would gladly vent if they knew how, but lie concealed or in effect loſt in the ſale, becauſe that diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which would as willingly buy ſuch at valuable prices, know not how or where to recouer them. But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is to be vnderſtood that no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of baſe qualitie or inferiour values ſhall be entred into this Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, but ſuch as the Officers ſhall thinke fit to be dealt in, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement of the place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5850:17"/>
Beſides, it often falleth out that men vpon extremity are driuen to pawne things of good value for ſmal ſummes, to ſerue their turnes with monies, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they can ſell them outright; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they vſe the means of Scriueners or Brokers, in whoſe hands they leaue the ſaid pawnes, ſetting very reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prices on them; allowing alſo a reward: and yet notwithſtanding it is often ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ene and ſpoken of, that many Scriueners or Brokers, to whom ſuch things haue beene committed in truſt, would neuer vent them at the owners prices, except they might make a greater ſurpluſage to themſelues then the rate limited. And by that meanes many haue beene kept in want of ſuch reliefe, as their owne goods would affoord
<pb facs="tcp:5850:18"/>
them; whereby at laſt their pawnes haue eaten themſelues out in vſury, or at leaſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aue beene ſolde to great loſſe, the owners wanting means to redeeme them: to which grieuance this publique Regiſter may yeelde a comfortable remedy.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, whereas many conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable men would willingly expoſe their monies for eight or nine in the hundred, but cannot make it knowne, and therefore doe put their ſtockes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of Brokers or Scriueners to imploy for them: ſo it is, that thoſe Brokers doe for the moſt part take ten in the hundred for thoſe monies which the owners doe affoord at a cheaper hand; thereby wronging both
<pb facs="tcp:5850:18"/>
the lender and borrower: which inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience this publique Register would eaſily remedy, by giuing all men ſafe and ready meanes to expoſe their own monies; beſides the aſſurance neuer to be deceiued in their truſt, which now many times happens when Brokers or Scriueners do chance to fall banck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rout.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, whereas there is daily occaſion of returning and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of monies from one part of the Kingdome to another, by meanes of Trade and Commerce: and therein is found a great defect for want of ſome ſafe and ſpeedy meanes of dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for interchangeable correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in that behalfe (becauſe that
<pb facs="tcp:5850:19"/>
men are now inforced eyther to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey thoſe monies that they are to pay or receiue, by Carriers, Clothiers, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eruants, who are many times robbed; or elſe men are driuen to be at extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary coſt, for the returnes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, by letters of exchange) by the vſe of this publique Regiſter men may (if they pleaſe) greatly eaſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy both theſe inconueniences. And to expreſſe the manner of doing it by example (which is the plainest way of inſtruction,) Suppoſe that if any Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, Merchant or Tradeſman of the North, vpon occaſion of buſines, being come to London, giues notice there vnto this Regiſter, that he can make preſent payment of monies in Yorke at a certaine day, to ſerue the
<pb facs="tcp:5850:19"/>
turnes of any Londoners, or others in that place, if they will deliuer the like ſummes in London; and ſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly may any Londoners or others ſearch the Regiſter to that or the like intent, whereby to giue himſelfe knowledge of any interchangeable correſpondency, for payments or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits at Yorke. And in this ſort may men mutually vnderſtand one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers mindes for Trade and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and with no leſſe facility and ſecurity ſerue their turnes one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in matters of this kinde, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all thoſe Cities of this Kingdome, where this publique Register ſhall be erected and kept, which will be free for all men to repaire vnto, at their pleaſures. But herein it is to be vnderſtood,
<pb facs="tcp:5850:20"/>
that this publique Regiſter ſhall not be made ſo vulgar, as to bee kept in euery chiefe Citie or Shiere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towne within the Realme, but in thoſe neceſſary and commodious places that ſhall be found moſt fit for the publicke good, and to performe thoſe benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Offices that are promiſed and may be expected by the vſe of this publique Regiſter for the aduancement of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Commerce.</p>
            <p>Againe, to giue thoſe men that would borrow full ſatisfaction, how they ſhall be aſſured when they come to this Regiſter for direction in that behalfe, and haue giuen the Officer ſuch gratuity, as in reaſon and out of his owne free will he hath thought
<pb facs="tcp:5850:20"/>
fit, in regard of the note or direction deliuered to ſerue his turne, for the ſummes that vpon good ſecurity he would take vp, and not be diſappointed nor loſe his reward giuen: Jf it ſo fall out (for ſuch accidents may happen) that either the party that ſhould lend this money be from home, or elſe how otherwiſe ſo diſpoſed of his ſtocke, (ſince the intelligence giuen to this Regiſter) that he cannot inſtantly ſerue the turne of him that would bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; let that party againe returne to the Office, and he ſhal either pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue another note, whereby to ſerue his turne, or elſe he ſhall receiue the reward that he hath giuen the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer in that behalfe: Whereby may plainly appeare, that there ſhall be no
<pb facs="tcp:5850:21"/>
ſhifts vſed eyther to fruſtrate men of their deſired purpoſe and hope in this Office, or trickes to draw rewards for that, which by the vſe of the Office, or trauell of the Officer is not merited. And in this point I haue thought fit to giue good caution; both for that ſuch chances may ſometimes fall out: and beſides it is not vnlikely, but that this obiection may be made. And therefore very pertinent to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and to auoyde doubts', plainely to ſet downe an anſwer, and certaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, what men may depend vpon, and how they ſhall be dealt withall in ſuch caſes, thereby to auoyde all ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And as in matters of borrowing, ſo vpon occaſions of buying, the like courſe and reſtitution ſhall be vſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5850:21"/>
