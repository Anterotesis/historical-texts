         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
EPISTLE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>I Presume I shall no
sooner appear up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Stage I am
prepared for, but
I must without evasion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to be assaulted by that
furious and inconsiderate
Monster called Censour;
whose lashes I will receive
<pb facs="tcp:53586:3"/>
with the same slight concern,
the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> did the
cruelty of their Correctors,
sporting themselves whilst
their backs were torn with
the unmerciful Whip. Of
that efficacy is Resolution,
that it presents pain but meer
Opinion, and values a
scoffing <hi>Lucian,</hi> or a satyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<hi>Memphus,</hi> no more then
a harmless <hi>Hellespont</hi> did the
vain threats of a proud <hi>Xer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes.
Seneca</hi> saith well, better
<hi>aliud agere quam nihil,</hi> for
<pb facs="tcp:53586:3"/>
Idleness is the Devils oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity:
the Considerations
of which (with my assent
to the Judgment of <hi>Thucidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
who sayes, To know a
thing and not to express it,
is all one as thongh he knew
it not) made me to expose
my self to publick view. My
Subject is good and great,
called by the Name of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi>
here I present her, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
mans Ingratitude,
who is fit to strip her of
those Robes of Priviledge
<pb facs="tcp:53586:4"/>
that God himself hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
her with, not: consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that what she acts, is
by the vertue of his Power;
and that She is one of those
Mirrours that represents him
to us, which a Philosophick
Passion adores as the supream
Efficient. But indeed, how
can She expect our Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
till we have divested
our selves of that prejudice
ignorance possesses us with,
which must be done by a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
reflex upon her Effects,
<pb facs="tcp:53586:4"/>
as this little Volumn will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you, if you read it
with an impartial and unbya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Reason; for I have, as all
others of the same Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
must do, used Philosophy
as the Tellescope by which
we must make our Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as you will, when you see,
find my curiosity descending
to little Insects, and that with
wonder at their production
out of Corruption; from
thence I view her care in
beautifying this little Globe
<pb facs="tcp:53586:5"/>
we live in, with Robes suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to every Season; and when
I ascend the lower Region,
and mark the Clouds rang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves in such bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
as though they intended
another Deluge, it occasions
wonder; so likewise the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the middle Region
with the heat of the upper,
and the Element of Fire, must
be Miracles to ignorance.
And if we observe the <hi>Moon,</hi>
with the Motion attending
that of the Seas flux and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux,
<pb facs="tcp:53586:5"/>
it would make us judge,
that there is some secret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
made <hi>ab Origine</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
her and the watery Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi>
I have spoken of in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
the next that presents us
with cause of Admiration, is
the glorious <hi>Sun,</hi> the Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
of the Universe, called
by some, and not improperly,
the <hi>Anima Mundi,</hi> for we find
her approach gives life to Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitives,
sense to Animals, and
almost a new Nature to Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onals.
<pb facs="tcp:53586:6"/>
As for <hi>Mars, Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
and <hi>Saturn,</hi> the Eighth
<hi>Sphere,</hi> and <hi>Christalline</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
&amp; the <hi>Empyreum,</hi> I have
treated on, if not like a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Secretary of Nature, yet
a submiss Admirer of her.
And whereas I make a refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Errours, as an additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to my Title, some perhaps
will say, I am like the Tinker,
that for stopping of one hole
make two, or for my refut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of one Errour, I have
made two; it may be I have
<pb facs="tcp:53586:6"/>
in the Opinion of some: But
whether I have or no, who
shall be judge? for what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
an Errour to one, is to
another a very evident truth:
sometimes a Week or a Day,
nay an hour puts a change
upon an Opinion of many
years standing. But let my
Errours be as great and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as I pretend to correct,
Reason shall convince me,
and command my Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment;
for it's our Errours
that presents us human. I
<pb facs="tcp:53586:7"/>
have writ this to give Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to others if I can;
but if not, howsoever I have
secured it to my self; And
let the Reader judge of it as
it pleases him. I have writ that
which delights me; And if
envie cause a misapplication
of my intention, it matters
not, the contempt of it will
make me bold to say, I value
it and thee after the rate as
thou dost it and me.</p>
            <p>The assertions here laid
down are plain and perspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb facs="tcp:53586:7"/>
convincing and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
to the intelligent.
But I know that common
prejudice which is usually
taken of any thing (though
never so true) which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to any mans belief, it
does beget such Passion and
animosity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and makes
such a breach as is hardly to
be repaired. And since our
own Opinion may make it
disputable what reason we
have to pretend of convince
another by, I shall only offer
<pb facs="tcp:53586:8"/>
this for common satisfaction,
that things demonstrable are
the most evident marks of
Truth; and that they are so
clearly manifested in this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Book, deserves nothing
but sobriety and moderation,
and a well weighing of the
matter herein contained.
Reader, I am loth to leave
thee, but that I would not
keep thee from the Book it
self, which I hope will be to
thy ample satisfaction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Natural History
Intermixed
With variety of Philosophical
Discourses, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>GOD by his presential Essence
gives unto all things an Essence;
so that if he should withdraw
himself from them, as out of
Nothing they were first made,
so into Nothing they would be
again resolved. In the preservation then of
the Creature, we are not to consider so much
the impotency and weakness thereof, as the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53586:9"/>
goodness, wisdom, and power of the Creator,
in whom, and by whom, and for whom, they
live, move, and have their being. <hi>The spirit of
the Lord filleth the world,</hi> saith the Author of
the <hi>Wisdom of Solomon;</hi> and the secret working
of the Spirit, which thus pierceth through all
things, as <hi>Virgil AEneid 6,</hi> hath excellently

                  <l>Fashions and works and wholly doth trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pierce</l>
                  <l>All this great body of the Universe.</l>
               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>The Spirit the <hi>Platonists</hi> call the Soul of the
World; by it, it is in some sort quickned and
formalized, as the body of Man is by its rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Soul. There is no question then, but
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53586:9"/>
that this Soul of the World, (if we may so
speak with reverence) being in truth no other
then the immortal spirit of the Creator, is able
for to make the Body of the World Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;
and to preserve it from Dissolution; as he
doth the Angels, and the spirits of men, were
it not, that he hath determined to dissolve it
by the same supernatural and extraordinary
Power, by which at the first he gave it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence.
For my own part I constantly believe
that it had a beginning, and shall have an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and judg him not worthy of the name of
a Christian; who is not of the same mind:
yet so as I believe both to be matter of faith;
<hi>Through Faith we understand that the Worlds were
framed by the Word of God, Heb.</hi> 11. 3. And
through the same Faith we understand like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
that they shall be again unframed by the
same Word. Reason may grope at this truth
in the dark; howbeit, it can never clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
it, till it be enlightned by the bright
beams of Faith. Though I deny not but that
it is probable, though not demonstrative, and
convincing Arguments may be drawn from
the discourse of Reason to prove either the
one or the other.</p>
            <p>I remember the Philosophers propose a
question, <hi>Uirum Mundus filo generall concursu
Dei perpet<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> durare possit?</hi> and for the most part
they conclude it affirmatively, even such as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53586:10"/>
professed the Christian Religion, and for the
proof of this assertion, they bring in effect this
reason. The Heavens, say they, are of a nature
which is not capable of it self of corruption;
the loss of the Elements is recovered by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation,
of mixt bodies without Life by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
of living bodies by succession, the fall
of the one being the rise of the other: as <hi>Rome</hi>
triumphed in the ruines of <hi>Alba,</hi> and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of one Scale is the elevation of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
according to that of <hi>Solomon, One genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
passeth away, and another generation cometh, but
the Earth abideth for ever,</hi> Eccles. 1. 4.</p>
            <p>Again, all Subcoelestial Bodies (as is evident)
consist of Matter and Form; now the first
Matter having nothing contrary unto it, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
by the force of Nature be destroyed; and
being Created immediately by God, it cannot
be abolished by any inferiour Agent. And as
for the Forms of Natural Bodies, no sooner
doth any one abandon the Matter it informed,
but another instantly steps into the place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
no sooner hath one acted his part and is
retired, but another presently comes forth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Stage, though it may be in a different
shape, and to act a different part; so that no
proportion of Matter is, or at any time can be
altogether void and empty; but like <hi>Vertumnes</hi>
or <hi>Proteus</hi> it turns it self into a thousand Shapes,
and is alwayes supplied and furnished with one
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53586:10"/>
Form or other, by a power Divine above Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
but to proceed, such and so great is the
Wisdom, the Bounty, and the Omnipotence
which God hath expressed in the Frame of the
Heavens, that the <hi>Psalmist</hi> might justly say,
<hi>The Heavens declare the glory of God, Psal.</hi> 19. 1.
The Sun, and the Moon, and the Stars serving

surely if he have made the floor of this great
house so beautiful, and garnished it with such
wonderful variety of Beasts, of Trees, of Herbs,
of Flowers, we need wonder the less at the
Magnificence of the Roof, which is the highest
part of the World, and the nearest to the
Mansion House of Saints and Angels. Now
as the excellency of these bodies appear in
their Situation, their Matter, their Magnitude,
and their Spherical and Circular Figure; so
specially in their great use and efficacy; not
only that they are for Signes and Seasons and
for Days and Years; but in that by their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
their Light, their warmth, and Influence,
they guide and govern, nay cherish and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
breed and beget these Inferiour Bodies,
even of Man himself, for whose sake the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
were made. It is truly said of the Prince
of Philosophers, <hi>Sol &amp; homo generunt hominem,</hi>
the Sun and Man beget Man. Man concurring
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53586:11"/>
in the generation of Man as an immediate,
and the Sun as a remote cause. And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place he doubts not to affirm of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
World in general. <hi>Necessa est Mundum

            <p>There is no question but the Heavens have a
marvellous great stroak upon the Air, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the Earth, the Plants, the Mettals, the
Beasts, and upon Man himself, at least wise in
regard of his body and natural faculties. To
let pass the quailing and withering of all
things by their recess, and their reviving and
resurrection, (as it were) by the reaccess of the
Sun. I am of opinion, that the sap of the trees
so precisely follows the motion of the Sun,
that it never rests, but is in a continual agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as the Sun it self; which no sooner arrives
at the <hi>Tropick,</hi> but he instantly returns, and
even at the very instant (as I conceive) and
I think it may be demonstrated by experimental
Conclusions) the sap which by degrees de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
with the declination of the Sun, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to remove at the approach thereof, by the
same steps that it descended: And as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of the Sun is scarce sensible at his first
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53586:11"/>
return, but afterwards the day increases more
in one week, than before in two; in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
also fares it with the Sap, in Plants, which
at the first ascends up insensibly and slowly,
but within a while much more swiftly and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently.
It is certain that the <hi>Tulip, Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gold,</hi>
and <hi>Sun-flower</hi> open with the rising, and
shut with the setting of the Sun; so that
though the Sun appear not, a man may more
infallibly know when it is high noon by their
full spreading, then by the Index of a Clock
or Watch. The <hi>Hop</hi> in its growing windeth
it self about the Pole, always following the
course of the Sun from East to West, and can
by no means be drawn to the contrary, choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
rather to break then yield.</p>
            <p>It is observed, by those that Sayl between
the <hi>Tropicks,</hi> that there is a constant set Wind,
blowing from the East to the West, Saylers
call it the <hi>Breeze,</hi> which rises and falls with the
Sun, and is always highest at noon; and is
commonly so strong, partly by its own blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and partly by over-ruling the Currant,
that they who sayl to <hi>Peru,</hi> cannot well return
the same way they came forth: And generally
Marriners do observe, that <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> they
sayl with more speed from the East to the
West, then back again from the West to the
East, in the same compass of time. All which
should argue a wheeling about of the Air, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53586:12"/>
Waters by the diurnal Motion of the Heavens,
and especial by the motion of the Sun. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
may be added, that high-Sea springs of
the year, are always nearer about the two
<hi>AEquinoctials</hi> and <hi>Solstices;</hi> and the <hi>Cock</hi> as a
trusty Watchman, both at midnight and
break of day, gives notice of the Suns ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</p>
            <p>These be the strange and secret effects of
the Sun, upon the inferiour Bodies; whence
by the <hi>Gentiles</hi> he was held the visible God of
the World: and termed the Eye thereof, which
alone saw all things in the World, and by
which the World saw all things in it self.</p>
            <q>Omnia qui videt, &amp; per quem videt omnia Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</q>
            <p>And most notably it is described by the
<hi>Psalmist, in them hath he set a Tabernacle for the
Sun, which is as a Bridegroom coming out of his
Chamber, and rejoyceth as a strong man to run a
race, his going forth is from the beginning of the
Heaven, and his Circuite to the end of it, and there
is nothing hid from the heat thereof,</hi> Psal. 19 4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p>Now as the effects of the Sun, the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring
of Light and warmth, are upon these
inferiour Bodies more active, so those of the
<hi>Moon</hi> (as being <hi>Ultima caelo, Citima terris,</hi>
nearer the Earth, and holding a greater resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53586:12"/>
therewith) are no less Manifest. And
therefore the Husbandman in sowing and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
grafting, and planting, lopping of Trees,
and felling of Timber, and the like, upon
good reason observes the waxing and wain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>Moon,</hi> which Learned <hi>Zanchius</hi> in his
<hi>Operibus Dei,</hi> well allows of; commending
<hi>Hesiod</hi> for his rules therein <hi>Quod ex Lunae de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementis
&amp; incrementis totius agricolationis signa
notet, quis improbet?</hi> who can mislike it that
Hesiod sets down the signs, in the whole course
of Husbandry, from the waxing and waining
of the <hi>Moon:</hi> the Tides and ebbs of the Sea
follow the course of it, so exactly, as the
Sea-men will tell you the age of the <hi>Moon</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the sight of the Tide as certainly, as if
he saw it in the water. It is the observation
of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> out of him, That <hi>Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
Mussels, Cockles, Lobsters, Crabbs, &amp;c.</hi> and
generally all Shell-fish grow fuller in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of the <hi>Moon,</hi> but emptier in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
thereof. Such a strong predominancy
it hath upon the Brain of Man, that <hi>Lunaticks</hi>
borrow their very name from it; as also doth
the Stone <hi>Selenites;</hi> whose property, as St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
and <hi>Georgius Agricola</hi> records it, is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
and decrease in Light with the <hi>Moon,</hi>
carrying always the resemblance thereof with
it self. Neither can it reasonably be imagined,
that other Planets, and Stars, and parts of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53586:13"/>
are without their forcible operations upon
these lower Bodies, specially considering that
the very Plants and Herbs of the Earth, which
we tread upon, have their several vertues, as
well single by themselves, as in composition
with other ingredients. The Physitian in
opening of a Vein, hath ever an eye to the
Sign then reigning. The <hi>Canicular</hi> Star, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in those hotter Climates, was by the
Ancients always held a dangerous Enemy to
the practise of Physick, and all kind of Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations.
Nay, <hi>Galen</hi> himself, the <hi>Oracle</hi> of
that profession, adviseth practitioners in that
Art, in all their cures, to have a special re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the reigning Constellations and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions
of the Planets. But the most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
m<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stery of Nature, in my Mind, is the
turning of Iron touched with the Load-stone
towards the North Pole; (of which I shall
have occasion to discourse more largely here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
in another Tract,) neither were it hard
to add much more to that which hath been
said, to shew the dependance of these Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
Bodies upon the Heavenly: Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God having ordained, that the higher
should serve as intermediate Agents, or secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary
Causes; but so, as in the Wheels of a
Clock; though the failing of the Superiour,
cannot but cause a failing in the Inferiour, yet
the failing of the Inferiour, may well argue
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53586:13"/>
somewhat for it self, though it cannot cause
a failing in the Superiour, we have great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
then, as I conceive, to begin with the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the State of Coelestial Bodies, in
as much as upon them the condition of the
subcoelestial depends. Wherein five things
will offer themselves to our consideration,
their Substances, their Motion, their Light,
their Warmth and their Influence. That
the Heavens are endued with some kind of
Matter, though some Philosophers in their
jangling humours, have made a doubt of it,
yet I think no sober and wise Christian will
deny it: But whether the Matter of it be the
same with that of these inferiour Bodies, <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huc
sub Judice lis est,</hi> it hath been and still is a
great question among Divines. The Ancient
Fathers and Doctors of the Primitive Church
for the most part following <hi>Plato,</hi> hold that
it agrees with the nature of the Elementary
Bodies, yet so as it is compounded of the finest
flower, and choicest delicacy of the Elements:
But the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> on the one side, that follow
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> adhere to his <hi>Quintessence,</hi> and by
no means will be beaten from it, since, say
they, If the Elements and the Heavens should
agree in the same Matter, it should consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
follow, that there should be a mutual Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffique
and, Commerce, a reciprocal Action
and Passion between them, which would soon

               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:53586:15"/>
draw on a change, and by degrees a ruine
upon those glorious Bodies. Now though
this point will never (I think) be fully and
finally determined, till we come to be inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of that place, whereof we dispute; (for
hardly do we guess aright at things that are
upon Earth. <hi>And with labour do we find the things
that a<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</hi> 9. 16. Yet for the
present, I should state it thus, that they agree
in the same Original Matter; and surely <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
methinks, seems to favour this opinion,
making but one Matter, (as far as I can gather
from the Text) out of which all bodily sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
were Created.</p>
            <q>Unus irat toto vultus in Orbe.
<hi>Ovid.</hi> 1. Metam.</q>
            <p>So as the Heavens, though they be not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of the Elements, yet are they made
of the same Matter that the Elements are
compounded of; They are not subject to the
qualities of heat, cold, or drought, or moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
nor yet to weight, or lightness, which
arise from those qualities, but have a Form
given them, which differeth from the Forms
of all corruptible Bodies, so as it suffereth nor,
nor can it suffer from any of them being so
excellent and perfect in it self, as it wholly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53586:15"/>
satiateth the appetite of the Matter, that is
informeth. The Coelestial Bodies then, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with so noble a Form to actuate them, are not,
nor cannot, in the course of Nature, be
lyable to any Generation or Corruption, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of their Substance; to any augmentation
or diminution, in regard of their quantity; no
nor any obstructive alteration, in respect of
their qualities.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant that the controversies
touching the Form, what it should be, is no less
then touching the Matter; some holding it to
be a living and a quickning Spirit, nay a sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and rational Soul; which opinion is stiffly
maintained by many great and learned Clerks,
both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and <hi>Christians,</hi> suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
it unreasonable that the Heavens which
impart life to other Bodies, should themselves
be destitute of Life: But this Errour is nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
discovered and confuted by <hi>Claudius Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus,</hi>
a famous Doctor of <hi>Sorbone,</hi> in a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
which he purposely composed on that
point <hi>de Caelorum animatione:</hi> In as much as
what is denied those bodies in Life, in Sense,
in Reason, is abundantly supplied in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and unchangeable duration, arising from
that inviolable knot &amp; indissoluble Marriage,
betwixt the Matter and the Form, which can
never suffer any Divorce, but from that hand
which first joyned them. And howbeit it
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53586:16"/>
cannot be denyed, that not only the reasonable
Soul of Man, but the sensitive of the least
Gnat that flies in the Air, and the vegetative of
the basest Plant that springs out of the Earth,
are (in that they are indued with Life) more
Divine, and nearer approaching the Fountain
of Life, then the Formes of the Heavenly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
yet as the Apostle speaketh of Faith,
Hope, and Charity, concludes Charity to be
the greatest, (though by Faith we do appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
and apply the merits of Christ) because
it is more universal in operation, and lassing in
duration; so though the Formes of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
endued with Life do in that regard, come
a step nearer to the Deity, then the Formes
of the Heavenly Bodies, which are without
Life, yet if we regard their purity, their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
their efficacy, their indeficiency in moving,
their universallity and independency in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
there is no question, but that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
may in that respect be preferred, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Man himself, for whose sake they were
made; Man being indeed Immortal, in regard
of his Soul, but the Heavens in regard of
their Bodies, as being made of an incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
stuff.</p>
            <p>Which cannot well stand with their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who held them to be compos'd of Fire,
or the Waters, which in the first of <hi>Genesis
are said to be above the Firmament,</hi> and in the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53586:16"/>
hundred forty eight <hi>Psalm, Above the Heavens,</hi>
are above the Heavens we now treat of, for
the tempering and qualifying of their heat, as
did <hi>St. Ambrose,</hi> and <hi>St. Augustine</hi> hold, and
many others, venerable for their Antiquity,
Learning, and Piety. Touching the former of
which Opinions, we shall have fitter opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to discourse, when we come to Treat of
the warmth caused by the Heavens. But touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Second, it seems to have been ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon a mistake of the Word Firmament,
which by the Ancients was commonly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
to the eighth Sphere, in which are
feated the fixed Starrs; whereas the Original
<hi>Hebrew</hi> (which properly signifies <hi>Extention,</hi> or
<hi>Expansion</hi>) In the first of <hi>Genesis,</hi> is not only
applied to the Spheres in which the <hi>Sun</hi> and
<hi>Moon</hi> are planted, but to the lowest Region
of the Air, in which the Birds flie; and so do
I with <hi>Pareus</hi> and <hi>Pererius,</hi> take it to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
in this controversie. This Region of
the Air being, as <hi>St. Augustine</hi> somewhere
speaks, <hi>Terminus intransgressibilis,</hi> a firme and
irremoveable wall of seperation betwixt the
waters that are bred in the bowels of the Earth,
and those of the Clouds. And for the Word
Heaven, which is used in the hundred forty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eighth
<hi>Psalm,</hi> it is likewise applied to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
Region of the Air, by the Prophet <hi>Jere<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y,
Jer.</hi> 10. 13. Which may serve for a Gloss
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53586:17"/>
upon the Text alleaged out of the <hi>Psalm,
When he uttereth his voice, there is a noise of the
waters in the Heavens, and he causeth the vapours
to ascend from the ends of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> finding that the placing
of the waters above the Starry Heavens, was
both unnatural and unuseful, and yet not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well acquainted with the propriety of the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> Word, to salve the matter, tell us of
a <hi>Christaline</hi> or glassie Heaven, above the eight
Sphere, which say they, is undoubtedly the
waters above the firmament, mentioned by
<hi>Moses;</hi> which exposition of theirs, doth
cross the course of <hi>Moses</hi> his Historical Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
his purpose being as it seems, only to
write the History of things which were visible
and sensible, as appeareth in part by his omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Creation of Angels; whereas the
<hi>Christaline</hi> Heaven they speak of, is not only
invisible and insensible; but was not at all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
to be, till the days of <hi>Hipparchus</hi> or
<hi>Ptolomy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for the fresh lustre and brightness
wherewith, as is commonly thought, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
shall be renewed at the last day, as a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by the turning is changed, and by chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
refreshed, it may be well by the making
them more resplendent then now they are, or
ever at any time were since their first Creation,
not by the scowring of contracted rust, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53586:17"/>
a new gloss and augmentation of glory.
And whereas some Authors have not doubted
to make the spots and shadows appearing in
the face of the <hi>Moon</hi> to be unredoubted argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of that contracted rust; if those spots
had not been original and native, of equal date
with the <hi>Moon</hi> her self, but had been contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the continuance of time, as wrinkles are
in the most beautiful faces, they had said some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,
but that they were above fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years agoe, appeareth by <hi>Plutarch's</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<hi>de Maculis in facie Lunae;</hi> and that they
have any whit since increased, it cannot be
sufficiently proved. Perchance by the help of
the late invented perspective-glass, they have
been more clearly and distinctly discerned then
in former ages, but that proves no more that
they were not there before, then that the <hi>Syde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra
Medcaeo,</hi> lately discovered by the vertue of
the same Instruments, were not before in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which the discoverers themselves knew
well enough they could not with any colour
of reason affirm.</p>
            <p>Howbeit it cannot be denyed, but that new
Stars have at times appeared in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
as some think, that was at our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
Birth; in as much as it appointed out
the very House in which he was born, by
standing over it, and was not (for ought we
find) observed by the <hi>Mathematicians</hi> of those
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53586:18"/>
times; I would rather think it to be a blazing
Light created in the Region of the Air, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the resemblance of a Star, seated in the
Firmament.</p>
            <p>As for that which appeared in <hi>Cassiopaea</hi> in
the year One thousand five hundred and
seventy two, (the very year of the great Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre
in <hi>France</hi>) I think it cannot well be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
to have been a true Star, it being observed
by the most skillful and famous <hi>Astronomers</hi> of
that time, to hold the same Aspect in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in Christendom, to run the same course,
to keep the same proportion, distance, and
situation, every-where, and in every point,
with the fixed Stars, for the space of two whole
years. But this I take not to have been the
effect of Nature, but the Supernatural and
miraculous work of Almighty God, the first
Author and free disposer of Nature. And the
like may be said of all such <hi>Comets</hi> which have
at any time evidently appeared, (if any such
evidence can be given) to be above the Globe
of the <hi>Moon.</hi>

Mathematici Nobiles,</hi> saith he, appeared
a marveilous great wonder, the most noted
Star cal'd <hi>Venus,</hi> which <hi>Plautus</hi> calls <hi>Vesperugo,</hi>
and <hi>Homer Vesperus</hi> the fair, as <hi>Castor</hi> hath left
upon Record, changed both colour, and big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
figure and motion, which accident was
never seen before, nor since that time; the
renouned Mathematicians <hi>Adrastus</hi> and <hi>Dion</hi>
averring that this fell out during the Reign of
King <hi>Ogyges;</hi> which wonder, neither <hi>Varro</hi> nor
<hi>Augustine</hi> ascribe to the changeable matter of
the Heavens, but to the unchangeable will of
the Creator. And therefore the one calls it as
we see <hi>mirabile portentum,</hi> and the other makes
this Comment upon it, that it happened, <hi>quia

condidit,</hi> because he would have it so, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
all things that he hath made, with a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
independing Power. So that two spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
reasons may be rendred for these extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
unusual Apparitions in Heaven; the
one that they may declare to the World that
they have a Creatour and Commander, who
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53586:19"/>
can alter and destroy their Natures, restrain
or suspend their operations at his pleasure,
which should keep men from worshiping them
as Gods, since they cannot keep themselves
from alteration. The other to portend and
foreshew his Judgments, as did that new Star
in <hi>Caessopaeia,</hi> a most unnatural inundation of
Blood in <hi>France;</hi> And this change in <hi>Venus,</hi>
such a Deluge in <hi>Achaia,</hi> as it overflowed, and
so wasted the whole Country, that for the

the <hi>Moons</hi> delivery from an Ecclipse
with a solemn Sacrifice, as soon as she shined
out bright again; which action of his, that

it as a sign of godliness and devotion;

this Eclipse was confined, in the borders of
<hi>Judaea</hi>; howsoever it cannot be denyed, but
that it was certainly besides and above the
compass of Nature. Neither ought it to seem
strange, That the <hi>Sun</hi> in the Firmament of
Heaven should appear to suffer, when the
Sun of Righteousness indeed Suffered upon
the Earth.</p>
            <p>But for other Ecclipses, though the causes be
not commonly known, yet the ignorance of
them was it which caused so much Superstition
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53586:21"/>
in former Ages, and left that impression in
mens minds, as even at this day, wise men
can hardly be perswaded, but that those Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
suffer in their Ecclipses, which in the <hi>Sun</hi>
is most childish and ridiculous to imagine;
since in it self, it is not so much as deprived of
any Light, nor in truth can be, it being the
Fountain of Light, from which all other
Starrs borrow their Light, but pay nothing
back again to it, by way of retribution. Which
was well expressed by <hi>Pericles,</hi> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> in
his Life reports it, for there happening an
Ecclipse of the <hi>Sun,</hi> at the very instant when
his Navy was ready to Lanch forth, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
was imbarked; his followers began much
to be appald at it, but especially the Master
of his own Gally, which <hi>Pericles</hi> perceiving;
takes his Cloak, and therewith hood winks the
Masters eyes, and then demands of him, what
danger was in that, he answering none, Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
said <hi>Pericles</hi> is there in this Ecclipse;
there being no difference betwixt that Vail
and my Cloak, with which the <hi>Sun</hi> is cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
but only in bigness. And the truth is
that the <hi>Sun</hi> then suffered no more by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening
of the <hi>Moon,</hi> then from <hi>Pericles</hi>
Cloak, or daily doth from the Clouds in the
Air, which hinder the sight of it; or by the
interposing of the Planet <hi>Mercury,</hi> which
hath sometimes appeared as a spot in it. But
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53586:21"/>
whether these Ecclipses either cause or presage
any change in these inferiour Bodies, I shall
have fitter occasion to examine hereafter;
and so I pass from the Consideration of the
substance, to the Motion of the Heavenly
Bodies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Motion</hi> is so universal and innate a property;
and so proper an affection to all Natural
Bodies, that the great Philosopher knew not
better how to define Nature, then by making
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> the Engineere and Principle of <hi>Motion;</hi>
and therefore as other Objects, are only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable
by the sense, as colours, and sounds
by hearing, <hi>Motion</hi> is discernable by both, nay
and by feeling too, which is a third sense real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
distinguished from them both. That there
is in the Heavenly Bodies, no <hi>motion</hi> of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
or Corruption, and of Augmentation
or Diminution, or Alteration, I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
shewed. There are also, by reason of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
swiftness of the first Mover, and some
other such Reasons; dare deny, (as <hi>Copernicus</hi>
doth) that there is in them any Lation, or
Local <hi>motion,</hi> herein flatly opposing in my
judgment both Scripture, Reason, and Sense;
But take it as granted, without any dispute,
that a Local <hi>motion</hi> there is; which is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Time, as Time again is the measure
of <hi>Motion;</hi> the Line of <hi>Motion,</hi> and the Thred
of Time, being both spun out together: some
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53586:22"/>
doubt there is touching the Mover of these
Heavenly Bodies, what or how it should be;
some ascribing it to their Matter, some to
their Form, and some to their Figure, and
many to the Angels, or Intelligences; as they
call them, which they suppose to be set over
them. For mine own part; I should think
that all these, and every one of them, might
not unjustly challenge a part in that <hi>Motion:</hi>
the Matter as being neither light nor heavy;
the Form as well agreeing with such a Matter;
the Figure as being Spherical or Circular; the
Intelligence as an assistant: in the Matter is a
disposition; for where light Bodies naturally
move upward, and heavy downward, that
which is neither light nor heavy, is rather
disposed to a Circular <hi>motion,</hi> which is neither
upward nor downward. In the Figure is an
inclination to that <hi>motion,</hi> as in a Wheel to be
carried round, from the Form an inchoation
or onset: and Lastly, from the intelligence,
a continuance or perpetuation thereof, as that
great Divine <hi>Hooker</hi> in his <hi>Ecclesiastical policy,</hi> 5.
69. Expresseth, (saith he,) <q>
                  <hi>Gods own Eternity
is the bound which leadeth Angels in the course
of their perpetuity, the perpetuity the hand that
draweth out Coelestial Motion; that as the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
substances are governed by the Heavenly,
so might the Heavenly by the Angelical. As
the Corruptible by the Incorruptible, so the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial

by the Immaterial, and all Finites by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.</hi>

It is the joynt consent of the <hi>Platonicks,

Motions, whether they perform themselves,

howbeit I confess, we cannot well ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
how one and the same body should be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
with opposite Motions, but by the help of
somewhat in which it is carryed. As the
Marriner may be carryed by the Motion of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53586:23"/>
his Ship, from the <hi>East</hi> to the <hi>West,</hi> and yet
himself may walk from the <hi>West</hi> to the <hi>East</hi>

it be, it is evident, that their Motions are
even and regular, without the least jarr or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
variation or uncertainty, languishing or
defect that may be; which were it not so,
there could be no certain demonstrations

The order and Regulation of which Motions
we shall easily perceive by taking a particular

do we find that they have quickned or
any way slackned these their courses, but that
in the same space of time they always run the

the bounds and limits to which these glorious

because he keepeth his courses and measures
exactly according to Gods prescription. But
the Motion of the Heavens puts me in mind
of passing from it to the Light thereof.
As the Waters were first spread over the face
of the Earth: So was the Light dispersed
through the Firmament: and as the Waters
were gathered into one heape, so was the
Light knit up, and united into one body:
as the gathering of the Waters was called the
Sea, so that of the Light was called the Sun.
As the Rivers come from the Sea, so is all the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53586:26"/>
Light of the Stars derived from the Sun;
and lastly, as the Sea is no whit lessened,
though it furnish the Earth with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of fresh Rivers: So though the Sun have
since the Creation, both furnished, and garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
the World with Light, neither is the
store of it thereby deminished, nor the beauty
of it any way stained. What the Light is,
whether of a corporeal or incorporeal Nature,
it is not easie to determine. Philosophers
dispute it, but cannot well resolve it. Such is
our ignorance, that even that by which we
see all things, we cannot discern what it self is.
But whatsoever it be, we are sure that of all
visible Creatures, it was the first that was
made, and comes nearest the name of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
in as much as it moveth in an instant from
the <hi>East</hi> to the <hi>West,</hi> and piercing through
all transparent Bodies, and still remains in it
self unmixed and undivided; it chaseth away
sad and melancholy thoughts, which the
Darkness both begets and maintains; it lifts
up our minds in meditation to him <hi>that is the
true Light, that Lightneth every man that cometh
into the World, himself dwelling in Light in accessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and cloathing himself with Light as with a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
And if we may behold in any one Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
any spark of that Eternal Fire, or any
farr-off dawning of Gods brightness, the same
in the beauty and vertue of this Light may be

2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. Which of the Angels can in
no sort be verified, yet it shews the lightsome
nature of Angels; so likewise the Angelical
nature of Light still flourishing in youth, and
is no more subject to decay then the Angels
are. They who maintain, that the Soul of
Man is derived <hi>ex traduce,</hi> hold withall that
the Father in begetting the sons Soul looses
none of his own, it being <hi>tanquam Lumen de
Lumine,</hi> as one Light from another: nay,
more then so, it is the very resemblance that
the <hi>Nicene Fathers</hi> thought not unmeet to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the unexpressible Generation of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Person in the <hi>Trinity</hi> from the First; who
is therefore termed by the Apostle <hi>The bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Glory, Heb.</hi>1. 3. As then the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Communicating of his Substance
to his Son, looses none of his own; so the
Sun by Communicating of his Light to the
World, looses no part nor degree thereof.
Some things there are of that nature, as they
may be both given and kept, as Knowledg and
Vertue, and Happiness, and Light, which in
Holy Scripture is Figuratively taken for them
all. Whether the same Individual Light, be
still resident in the body of the Sun, which
was planted in it at the first Creation; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it continue empty and spend it self, and
so l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for my part, I cannot certainly affirm, though
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53586:27"/>
I must confess, I do rather incline to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:
But this I believe, as the body of the
Sun is no whit lessened in extention, so neither
is the Light thereof in intention: Men being
now no more able to fix their eyes upon it,
when it shines forth in its full strength, then
they were at the first Creation of it. Now we
have spoken of the Light, we shall next dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of the warmth and influence thereof,
which springs from it, which now succede in
their order.</p>
            <p>The Light of Heaven, of which we have
spoken, is not more comfortable and useful,
then is the warmth thereof; with a Masculine
vertue it quickens all kind of Seeds, it makes
them Vegitate, blossom and fructifie, and
brings their Fruit to Perfection, for the use of
Man and Beast, and the perpetuating of their
own kindness; nay, it wonderfully refresheth
and chears up the Spirits of Men, Beasts, Birds,
and creeping things; and not only imparts the
life of Vegitation, but of Sense and Motion,
to many thousand Creatures, and like a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Parent fosters and cherisheth it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.
Some there are that live without the
light of Heaven, searching into and working
upon those Bodies which the Light cannot
pierce, but none without the warmth, it being
in nature the universal instrument thereof,
which made the <hi>Psalmist</hi> say, <hi>That there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53586:28"/>
hid from the heat of the Sun.</hi> Few things
are hid from the Light, but from the Heat
thereof nothing.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant that St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> St. <hi>Basil,</hi>
St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and many Divines, held that there
were Waters, properly so termed, above the
Starry Firmament; who held withal, that the
Sun and Starrs cause heat as being of a fiery
Nature; those waters being set there, in their
Opinion, for the cooling of that heat, which
Opinion of theirs seems to be favoured by <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racides</hi>
in the forty third of <hi>Ecclesiasticus,</hi> where
he thus speaks of the Sun, <hi>At noon it parcheth
the Country, and who can abide the burning heat
thereof. A man blowing a Furnace is in works of
heat: but the Sun bu neth the Mountains three
times more, breathing out fiery vapours.</hi> Neither
were there wanting some among the Ancient
Philosophers, who maintained the same Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
as <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> and generally the
whole Sect of <hi>Stoicks,</hi> who held that the Sun
and the Starrs were fed with watery vapours,
which they drew up for their nourishment,
and that when the vapours should cease and
fail, the whole world should be in danger of
combustion; and many things are alledged by
<hi>Baelbo</hi> in <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Second Book of the Nature of
the Gods, in favour of this Opinion of the
<hi>Stoick.</hi> But that the Sun and Starrs are not
in truth fiery and hot, appears by the ground
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53586:28"/>
already laid touching the matter of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
that it is of a nature incorruptible, which
cannot be if it were fiery, in as much as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it would become lyable to alteration and
corruption by an opposite and professed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:
besides, all fiery bodies by a natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
mount upwards, so that if the Starrs
were the cause of heat, as being hot in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
it would consequently follow, that
their circular Motion should not be natural
but violent: Whereunto I may adde, the
noted Starrs being so many in number, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
One thousand twenty and two, besides
the Planets, and in Magnitude so great, that
every one of those, which appear fixed in
the Firmament, are said to be much bigger
then the whole Globe of the Water and
Earth; and the Sun again so much to exceed
both that Glob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and the biggest of them, as
it may justly be stiled by the Son of <hi>Syrac,
Instrumentum admirabile,</hi> A wonderful instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Ecclesiast.</hi> 43. 1. Which being so, were
they of fire, they would doubtless long ere
this have turned the World into ashes, there
being so infinite a disproportion betwixt their
flame, and the little quantity of matter sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be prepared for their Fewel. That
therefore they should be fed with vapours,
<hi>Aristotle</hi> deservedly laughs at it, as a childish
and ridiculous device, in as much as the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53586:29"/>
ascend no higher then the middle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of the Air, and then distill again upon
the Water and the Earth from whence they
were drawn up; and those vapours being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
the flames likewise feeding upon them
must needs be uncertain, and daily vary from
themselves both in quantity and figure, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the proportion of their Fewel.</p>
            <p>The absurdity then of this Opinion being
so foule and gross, it remains that the Sun
and Starrs infuse a warmth into these Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coelestial
Bodies, as not being hot in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but only, as being ordained by God to
bread heat in matter capable thereof, as they
impart life to some Creatures, and yet, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
remain void of life, like the brain which
imparts sense to every Member of the Body,
and yet is it self utterly void of sense. But
here again, some there are which attribute
this effect to the Motion, others to the Light
of these glorious Bodies: And true indeed it
is, that Motion causes Heat, by the attenuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and rarefaction of the Air; But by this
reason should the Moon, which is nearer the
Earth, warm more than the Sun which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thousand miles farther distant? and the
higher Regions of the Air, should be always
hotter than the lower, which notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
if we compare the second with the lowest,
is undoubtedly false. Moreover the Motion
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53586:29"/>
of the Coelestial Bodies being uniform, so
should the heat in reason derived from them
likewise be; and the Motion ceasing, the Heat
should likewise; and yet I shall never believe,
that when the Sun stood still at the Prayer of
<hi>Joshua,</hi> it then ceased to warm these Inferiour
Bodies. And we find by experience, that the
Sun works more powerfully upon a Body,
which stands still then when it moves, and the
reason seems to be the same in the rest or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Body warming or warmed, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
or imparteth heat.</p>
            <p>The Motion being thus excluded from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the cause of this Effect, the Light must
of necessity step in, and challenge it to its self;
the Light then it is which is the cause un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
of Coelestial heat, in part by a direct
beam, but more vehemently by a reflexed:
for which very reason it is that the middle
Region of the Air is always colder then the
lowest, and the lowest hotter in the Summer
then in the Winter, and at Noon then in the
Morning and Evening, the beams being then
more Perpendicular, and consequently in their
reflection more narrowly united, by which
reflexion and union, they grow sometimes to
that fervency of heat, that fire springs out
from them as we see in Burning-glasses; And
by this artificial device it was that <hi>Archimedes,</hi>
as <hi>Galen</hi> reports it in his third Book <hi>De tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peramentis,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53586:30"/>
Cap.</hi> 1. Set on fire the <hi>Emperours</hi> Ships:
and <hi>Proclus</hi> a famous <hi>Mathematician,</hi> practised
the like at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as witnesseth <hi>Zonarus</hi>
in the life of <hi>Anastatius</hi> the <hi>Emperour.</hi> And
very reasonable methinks it is, That Light, the
most Divine Affection of the Coelestial Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
should be the cause of warmth; the
most noble active and excellent quality of
the Subcoelestial. These two like <hi>Hippocrates</hi>
Twins, <hi>Simul oriuntur &amp; moriuntur,</hi> they are
born and dye together, they increase and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
both together; the greater the Light is,
the greater the Heat; and therefore the Sun as
much exceeds the other Starrs in Heat, as it
doth in Light.</p>
            <p>The Suns continual Declination, or nearer
approach to the Earth, is rather an idle Dream
than a sound position, grounded rather upon
the difference amongst <hi>Astronomers,</hi> arising
from the difficulty of their observations, then
upon any certain or infallible conclusion.
<hi>Ptolomy,</hi> who lived about the year of <hi>Christ</hi> one
hundred and forty, makes the distance of the
Sun to be from the Earth, One thousand two
hundred and ten Semidiameters of the Earth.
<hi>Albategnius,</hi> about the year Eight hundred and
eighty, makes it One thousand one hundred
and forty six. <hi>Copernicus,</hi> about the year One
thousand five hundred and twenty, makes it
One thousand five hundred and seventy nine.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53586:30"/>
               <hi>Tycobrahe,</hi> about the year One thousand six
hundred makes it One thousand one hundred
eighty two. Now I would demand whether
the Sun were more remote in <hi>Ptolomies</hi> time,
and nearer in the time of <hi>Albategnius,</hi> and
then again, more remote in the latter ages of
<hi>Copernicus</hi> and <hi>Tychobrahe</hi>? which if it were so,
then one of these two must needs follow, that
either these observations were not grounded
upon so certain Principles as they pretend, or
that the declination of the Sun is uncertain or
variable, not constant and perpetual, as is
pretended. But what would <hi>Bodwin</hi> say,
if he l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ved, to hear <hi>Lansbergius</hi> and <hi>Kepler,</hi> and
other famous <hi>Astronomers</hi> of the latter times,
teaching that the Sun is now remote above
Two thousand and eight hundred, nay three
thousand Semidiameters from the Earth;
affirming, that <hi>Copernicus</hi> and <hi>Tycobrahe</hi> neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to allow for refractions, which (as the <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>
will demonstrate) do much alter the
case.</p>
            <p>I will close up this point with the censure
of <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his <hi>Exercit.</hi> 99. upon the Patrons
of this fancy, <hi>Quae vero nonnulli prodere ausi sunt,
solis corpus longè proprius nos esse, quam quantum ab
Antiquis scriptum sit, it a ut in ipsa deferentis corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>cum mutasse videatur, vel ipsa scripta spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giis,
vel ipsi Authores scuticis sunt castigandi.</hi> In
as much as some have dared to broach, that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53586:31"/>
the body of the Sun is nearer the Earth then
by the Ancients was observed to be, so that it
might seem to have changed place in the very
bulk of the Sphear; either the Authors of
this Opinion deserve themselves to be chasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with stripes, or surely their Writings to be
razed with Sponges.</p>
            <p>So that (as I conceive) it may fitly and safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be inferred, first, that either there is no such
removal at all of the Sun, (as is supposed)
or if there be, as we who are situate more
Northerly, feel perhaps the effects of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of the warmth thereof, in the unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ripening of our fruits, or the like; so, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
by the rule of Proportion, must it needs
follow, that they who lye in the same distance
from the <hi>South</hi> Pole, as we from the <hi>North,</hi>
should enjoy the benefit of the nearer approach
thereof; and they who dwell in the ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>test
Climates interjacent, of the abating of the
immoderate fervency of their heat: From
hence I again infer, that supposing a mutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in the Suns greatest Declination, look
what dammage we suffer by his further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
from us in the Summer, is at least in
part recompenced by his nearer approach in
Winter, and by his Periodical Revolutions ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
restored. And so I pass from the Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the warmth, to those hidden and
secret qualities of the Heavens, which to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53586:31"/>
               <hi>Astronomers</hi> and <hi>Philosophers</hi> are known by the
name of Influences.</p>
            <p>Howbeit <hi>Aristotle</hi> thorow all those Works
of his which are come to our hands, to my
remembrance, hath not once vouchsafed so
much as to take notice of such qualities, which
we call Influences; and though amongst the
Ancients <hi>Averroes</hi> and <hi>Avicenne,</hi> and amongst
some of the latter times <hi>Picus Mirandula,</hi> and
<hi>Georgius Agricola,</hi> seek to disprove them: yet
both Scripture, and Reason, and the weighty
Authority of many good Schollars, as well
Christians as <hi>Ethnicks,</hi> have fully resolved me
that such there are. They are by Philosophers
distinguished into two Ranks; the First is, that
Influence which is derived from the <hi>Empyreal</hi>
Immoveable Heaven, the Pallas and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
House of Glorifyed Saints and Angels,
which is gathered from the diversity of Effects,
as well in regard of Plants, as of Beasts, and
other Commodities under the same Climate,
within the same Tract and Latitude, equally
distant from both the Poles, which we cannot
well originally refer to the inbred nature of
the soile, since the Author of Nature hath so
ordained, that the temper of the Inferiour
Bodies should ordinarily depend upon the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour;
nor yet the Aspect of the moveable
Spheres and Starrs, since every part of the
same Climate, successively, but equally enjoyes
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53586:32"/>
the same Aspect: It remains then, that these
Effects be finally reduced to some Superiour
immoveable cause; which can be none other
then that <hi>Empyreal Heaven;</hi> neither can it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
these effects by means of the Light alone,
which is uniformly dispersed through the
whole, but by some secret quality which is
diversified according to the divers parts
thereof; and without this, we should not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
find wanting that connexion and unity of
order, in the parts of the World, which make
it so comly, but withal should be forced to
make one of the worthiest peeces of it void
of Action, the chief end of every Created
thing. Neither can this Action mis-beseem the
worthiness of so glorious a piece, since both
the Creatour is still busied in the works of
Providence, and the Inhabitants in the works
of Ministration.</p>
            <p>The other kind is that which is derived
from the Starrs, the Aspect of several Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellations,
the Opposition and Conjunction of
the Planets, and the like. These we have
warranted by the mouth of God himself, in
<hi>Job</hi> 38. 31. according to our last and most
exact Translation; <hi>Canst thou bind the sweet In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
of the</hi> Pleiades, <hi>or loose the bands of</hi> Orion?
<hi>canst thou bring forth</hi> Mazoreth <hi>in his season?
or canst thou guide</hi> Arcturus <hi>with his Sons?
know'st thou the Ordinances of Heaven? canst thou
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53586:32"/>
set the dominion thereof in the Earth?</hi> where by
the Ordinances of Heaven, it may be thought
is meant, the course and order of these hidden
qualities, which without Divine and Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Revelation, can never perfectly be
known to any mortal Creature.</p>
            <p>Besides as <hi>Sr. Walter Raleigh</hi> hath well and
truly observed, it cannot be doubted, but the
Starrs are Instruments of far greater use, then
to give an obscure Light, and for men only
to gaze at after Sun set: it being manifest that
the diversity of Seasons, the <hi>Winters</hi> and <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi>
more hot or cold, more dry or wet, are
not so uncertained by the Sun and Moon
alone, who alwayes keep one and the same
Course, but that the Starrs have also their
working therein, as also in producing of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
kinds of Mettals and Minerals in the
bowels of the Earth, where neither Light
nor Heat can pierce. For as Heat pierces
where Light cannot, so the Influence pierces
where the Heat cannot.</p>
            <p>Moreover, if we cannot deny, but that God
hath given Vertues to Springs and Fountains,
to the cold Earth, to Plants, to Stones, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
nay to the excremental parts of the
basest living Creatures; why should we rob
the beautiful Stars of their working Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers?
for seeing they are many in number,
and of eminent beauty and Magnitude, we
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53586:33"/>
may not think, in the Treasury of his Wisdom
who is Infinite, there can be wanting; even
for every Star, a peculiar Vertue and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
As every Herb, Plant, Fruit, and Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
adorning the face of the Earth, hath the
like. As then these were not Created to beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the Earth alone, or to cover and shaddow
her dusty face; but otherwise, for the use of
Man and Beast, to feed them and cure them:
so were not those incomparably glorious Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
set in the Firmament, to none other end
then to adorn it, but for Instruments and
Organs of his Divine Providence, and Power,
so far as it hath pleased his just Will for to
determine; which <hi>Bartas</hi> admirably express<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</p>
            <q>
               <l>I'le ne'r believe, that the <hi>Arch-Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect.</hi>

               <l>With all these Fires the Heavenly Arches

Shields</l>
               <l>T' amaze poor Shepheards watching in

               <l>I'le ne'r believe, that the least Power that
pranks</l>
               <l>Our Golden Borders, or the common
Banks,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:53586:33"/>
And the lest Stone that in her warming
lap,</l>
               <l>Our kind nurse Earth covetously doth
wrap,</l>
               <l>Hath some peculiar Vertue of its own,</l>
               <l>And that the Glorious Starrs of Heaven
have none,</l>
               <l>But shine in vaine, and have no charge
precise,</l>
               <l>But to be walking in Heavens Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</l>
               <l>And through that Pallace up and down

               <l>As golden Guls about a Princes Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But how far it hath pleased God in his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Wisdom to determine of these Influences,
it is hard, I confess, to be determined by any
human Knowledg.</p>
            <p>For if in the peculiar vertues of Herbs and
Plants, which our selves sow and set, and
which grow under our feet, and we daily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to our several uses, we are notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in effect ignorant, much more in the
Powers and workings of the Coelestial Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
For (as to this purpose we said before)
<hi>Hardly do we guess at the things that are on the
Earth, and with labour do we find the things that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53586:34"/>
are before us: but the things which are in Heaven
who hath searched out? Wisd.</hi> 9. 16. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
well be denyed, but that they are not
Signes only, but at least wise concurrent Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of immoderate cold or heat, drought,
or moisture, lightning, thunder, raging winds,
Inundations, Earthquakes, and consequently
of Famine and Pestilence; yet such cross ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
may and often do fall out, in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
upon which they work, that the Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nostication
of these casual Events, by the most
skillful <hi>Astronomers,</hi> is very uncertain: And
for the common Alminacks, a man by obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
shall easily find, that the contrary to
their Predictions is commonly truest.</p>
            <p>Now for the things which rest in the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Mans Will, the Starrs have doubtless
no power over them, except it be led by
the sensitive appetite, and that again stirred up
by the constitution and complexion of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
as too often it is, specially when the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of the Body are strong to assault, and
the Vertues of the Mind weak to resist. If
they have dominion over Beasts, what shall
we judge of Men, who differ little from Beasts?
I cannot tell, but sure I am, that though the
Starrs incline a Man to this or that course of
life, they do but incline, inforce they cannot:
Education and Reason, and most of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
may alter and over-master that Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53586:34"/>
as they may produce a clean contrary
Effect. It was to this purpose, a good and
Memorable speech of Cardinal <hi>Poole,</hi> who
being certified by one of his acquaintance, who
professed the knowledg of these secret favours
of the Starrs, that he should be raised and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
to a great Calling in the World; made
answer, that whatsoever was portended by the
figure of his birth, for natural Generation,
was cancelled and altered by the grace of his
second Birth, or Regeneration in the Blood
of his Redeemer.</p>
            <p>Again, we may not forget that Almighty
God created the Starrs, as he did the rest of
the Universal, whose secret Influences may
be called his reserved and unwritten Laws,
which by his Prerogative Royal he may put
in execution, or dispence with at his pleasure.
For were the strength of the Starrs such as
God hath quitted unto them, all Dominion
over his Creatures, that Petition in the Lords
Prayer, <hi>Lead us not into Temptation, but deliver us
from Evil,</hi> had been none other but a vain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of words and time. Nay, be he <hi>Paga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>
or <hi>Christian</hi> that so believeth, the only true
God of the one, and the imaginary God of
the other, would thereby be despoyled of all
worship, reverence, and respect.</p>
            <p>As therefore I do not consent with them
who would make those glorious Creatures of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53586:35"/>
God vertuless; so I think that we derogate
from his Eternal and Absolute Power, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
to them the Dominion over our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Souls, which they have over our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
Substances, and perishable Natures. For
the Souls of Men loving and fearing God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Influence from that Divine Light it self,
whereof the Suns Clarity and that of the Starrs
is by <hi>Plato</hi> called but a shadow, <hi>Lumen est Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra
Dei, &amp; Deus est Lumen Luminis,</hi> Light is
the shadow of Gods brightness, who is the
Light of Lights.</p>
            <p>There have been great talks touching the
Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and many
ominous conjectures are cast abroad upon
it, which if perhaps they prove true, I should
rather ascribe it to our sins, then to the Stars;
they were not created to govern, but to serve
Man, if he serve and be governed by his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour:
so that we need not to search the Cause
so far off in the book of Heaven, we may
find it written nearer home in our own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somes:
And for the Stars, I may say, as our
Saviour Christ doth the Sabboth, the Stars
were made for Men, and not Men for the Stars;
and if God be on our side, and we on his, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi>
and <hi>Saturn</hi> shall never hurt us. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
the force of the States be, upon the

there is no sense of their weight or light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53586:40"/>
in their proper places, as appears by this,
that a Man lying in the bottom of the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Ocean, he feels no burthen from the weight
thereof; the Fire shall serve to warm us, the
Air to maintain our breathing, the Water to
cleanse and refresh us, the Earth to feed and
support us, and which of them is most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for our use is hard to determine:
Likewise they still hold the same proportion
one towards another, as they have done:
For howbeit the <hi>Peripeteticks,</hi> pretending here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Authority of their <hi>Mr. Aristotle,</hi> tell
us, that'as they rise above one another in Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation,
so they exceed one another <hi>properti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one
decupla,</hi> by a ten-fold proportion; yet is this
doubtless a foul Errour, or at least-wise a
gross mistake, whether we regard their entire
bodies, or their parts? if their entire bodies,
it is certain, that the Earth exceeds both the
Water and the Air by many degrees: the
depth of the Waters not exceeding two or
three miles, and for the most part not above
halfe a mile, as Marriners find by their Line
and Plummer, whereas the Diameter of the
Earth, as <hi>Mathematicians</hi> demonstrate, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
Seven thousand miles. And for the
Air, taking the height of it from the part of
the ordinary Comets, it contains by estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
about fifty two miles, as <hi>Nonius, Vitellio,</hi>
and Alb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>en shew by <hi>Geometrical</hi> proofs.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53586:41"/>
Whence it plainly appears, that there cannot
be that proportion betwixt the entire Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the Elements which is pretended, nor
at any time was since the Creation. And for
their parts, 'tis as clear by experience, that out
of a few drops of Water, may be made so
much Air as shall exceed them a thousand
times at least.</p>
            <p>There is in the Elements a noble compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
of their fourfold qualities, dispencing
themselves by even turnes and just measures.
For as the Circle of the Year is distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by four quarters, one succeeding another,
the time running about by equal distan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
In like manner the Four Elements of the
VVorld by a reciprocal vicissitude exceed
one another: and which a man would think
to be incredible, while they seem to dye, as
<hi>Philo</hi> writes, they become Immortal, running
the same race, and instantly traveling up and
down by the same path. From the Earth
the way riseth upward,, it dissolving into
VVater, the VVater vapours forth into the
Air, the Air is rarified into Fire, and again
they descend downward the same way, the
Fire by quenching being turned into Air, the
Air thickned itto VVater, and the Water into
Earth. Hitherto <hi>Philo,</hi> wherein after his usual

the Matter of the <hi>Comet,</hi> to be a very hot
and dry exhalation, which being lifted up, by
the force and vertue of the Sun, into the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Region of the Air is there inflamed, partly
by the Elements of Fire, upon which it bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth,
and partly by the motions of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53586:42"/>
which hurleth it about; so that there is
in the same manner of an <hi>Earth-quake,</hi> the
Wind, the Lightning, and a Comet, if it be
imprisoned in the bowels of the Earth, it
causeth an <hi>Earthquake,</hi> if it ascend to the

Lightning; if it pass that Region a <hi>Comet,</hi> or

            <p>The common Opinion hath been, that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
either as Signes or Causes, or both, have
always Prognosticated some dreadful mishaps
to the World, as out-ragious Winds, extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary

            <p>So <hi>Manelius</hi> hath it. But the Lord Privy

against the Poyson of supposed Prophesies,
hath so strongly incountered this Opinion,
that for my own part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> must profess, he hath

those Predictions, in as much as <hi>Comets</hi> do not
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53586:43"/>
always fore run such events, neither do these
events always follow upon the appearing of
<hi>Comets.</hi> Some instances he produceth of <hi>Comets,</hi>
which brought with them such abundance of
all things, and abated their prises to so low an
Ebbe, as stories have recorded it for Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and Miracles to posterity: and the like,
saith he, could I say of others, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1555.
1556. 1557. 1558. After all which years
nothing chanced that should drive a man to
seek out any cause above the common reach:
and therefore I do allow of the diligence of
<hi>Gemma-Frisius,</hi> in taking notice of as many
good, as bad effects, which have succeeded af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Comets.</hi> Moreover he tells us, that <hi>Peucer,</hi>
a great Mathematician of <hi>Germany,</hi> Prognosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
upon the last <hi>Comet,</hi> before the writing
of his Defensative, that Mens bodies should
be parched and burned up with heat: But
how fell it out? Forsooth, saith he, we had
not a more unkindly <hi>Summer</hi> for many years,
in respect of extraordinary cold: never less
inclination to War; No Prince deceased in
that time, and the Plague in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> as God
would have it, ceased at the rising of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.</hi>
Besides all this he reports, of his own
experience, as an Eye witness, that when divers
persons, upon greater scrupulosity then cause,
went about to disswade <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> lying
then at <hi>Richmond,</hi> from looking on the <hi>Comet</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:53586:43"/>
which then appeared, with a courage answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to the greatness of her State, she cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Window to be set open, and cast out
this Word, <hi>Jacta est alea,</hi> the Dice are thrown;
thereby shewing, that her st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dfast hope and
confidence, was too firmly planted in the
good pleasure and Providence of God, as
not to be blasted or affrighted with those
beams, which either had a ground in Nature
whereupon to rise, or at least-wise no warrant
in Scripture to portend the misfortune of
Princes. Neither have I heard of any <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>
that appeared before her Death (as at her
entrance there did) nor that of Prince <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
nor of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great of <hi>France;</hi> the one
being a most peerless Queen, the other a most
incomparable Prince, and the third for Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Valour, a matchless King: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as <hi>Seneca</hi> truly notes Natural is <hi>magis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va

new and strange, than those which are in
their own nature truly great; yet even
amongst the Ancients, <hi>Charlemaine</hi> professed,
that he feared not the signe of the <hi>Blazing-Star,</hi>
but the Great and Potent Creator there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
And <hi>Vespasian,</hi> as <hi>Dion</hi> reports, when the
apparition of a <hi>Comet</hi> was thought to portend
his Death, replied merrily: No, said he,
this bushy Star notes not me, but the <hi>Parthian</hi>

King: <hi>Ipse enim Cometus est, ego vero calvus sum;</hi>
for he wares bushy Locks, but I am bald.
Lastly, some <hi>Comets</hi> have been the Messengers
of joyful and happy tidings, as at the Birth of
our Saviour, and another at the Death of
<hi>Nero, Cometes summè bonis apparuit, qui prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntius

as to some judgments we are sensible (they
by the Effects have been predictive) though
the <hi>Astronomers</hi> have not found them out.
Now that which hath been said of <hi>Comets</hi> may
also be applied to other Fiery and Watery
<hi>Meteors,</hi> as Streamings, Swords, flying Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons,
fighting Armies, Gapings, two or three
Sunns and Moons, and the like appearing in

and Rain. Thunder and Lightning Frost and
Snow, Hail and Winds, yea and Contagious
Sicknesses, and Pestilential and Epidemical

            <p>
               <hi>Earthquakes</hi> arise also from the distempers
of the Air, but in another manner. They

terrible, so are the burnings of the Bowels
thereof no less dreadful; the one being as it
were the cold, and the other the hot fits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
The Mountain <hi>AEtna</hi> in <hi>Sicile</hi> hath flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in time past so abundantly, that by reason
of the thick smoak and vapours arising there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from,
the Inhabitants thereabout sometimes

Philosophy that the principal faculties of the
Soul, the Understanding, the Imagination and
Memory are distinguished by three several
Cells or Ventricles in the Brain, the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(as is conceived) being confined to the
fore-part, the Memory to the hinder part,
and the Judgment and Understanding to the

dispersed through all the receptacles of the

one of these Faculties is hurt, and sometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
when but one Ventricle is hurt the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all the three Faculties is hindred. Neither
ought it to seem more strange, that the same
Ventricle in the brain should be capable of all
these three Function, then that the same Bone
or Sinew and every part or Particle thereof
should have in it (in regard of the nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

which Language he could speak by Nature
if he were not taught some other: but this
is a Dream, and hath as <hi>Herodotus Lib. 6.</hi> been
twice confuted by a double experiment.
The first was by <hi>Psammeticus</hi> a King of <hi>AEgypt,</hi>
who desiring to understand which was Mans
most Ancient and Natural Language, caused
two Children to be seq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of Men, and to be nourished by two she <hi>Goats,</hi>
forbidding all speech unto them: which the
Children continuing for a long time Dumb,
at last uttered <hi>Bec, Bec</hi>: The King being infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
that in the <hi>Phrigian</hi> Language <hi>Bec</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
Bread, imagined the Children called
then for Bread; and from thence collected
that because they spake that Language which
no man had taught them, therefore the <hi>Phri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi>
Language was the Natural speech of Man.
A weak proof and silly conceit. For the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
<hi>Beck</hi> (as is probably collected) was only
that Language which they learned of their
Goat-Nurses, when they came to suck their
Tetts, who receiving from them some ease
by their sucking, saluted them with <hi>Bec,</hi> the
best Language they had, from whom the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53586:48"/>
learned it; and so much as they heard, so

                  </gap>st they uttered, and no more: and
if they had not heard it, they could never have
pronounced it, as we may evidently see in men
that are born Deaf; and by another experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
tryed upon other Infants, (which is
our second instance) <hi>Purchas</hi> mentions it in
his Pilgrims, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 8. tryed by <hi>Melab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dim
Elchebar,</hi> whom they call the great <hi>Mogo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi>
or <hi>Magul.</hi> He likewise upon the forenamed
Errour, That a Man hath a certain proper
Language by Nature, caused thirty Children
to be brought up in dumb silence, to find
out the Experiment, whether all of them
would speak one and the same Language, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inwardly a purpose to frame his Religion
according to that Nation, whose Language
should be spoken, as being that Religion
which is purely Natural to Man. But the
Children proved all Dumb, though they
were so many of them, and therefore they
could not speak, because they were not taught:
whereby it appeareth, that the speaking of
any Language is not in Man by Nature;
the first Man had it by Divine Infusion, but
all his Posterity only by Imitation.</item>
               <item>4. In <hi>Philosophy</hi> it is commonly received,
that the Heart is the seat and shop of the
Principal Faculties of the Soul: Nay, Divine
Scripture applying it self to the ordinary
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53586:48"/>
Opinion therein, in many places Attributes
Wisdom and Understanding to the Heart:
Whereas the noble pair of Physitians <hi>Hipocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
and <hi>Galen</hi> have made it evident by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
proofs, that those Divine Powers of
reasoning and discourse are seated in the
brain, in as much as they are never hindred
by the Distemper of the Heart, but of the
Brain, nor recovered, being lost, by Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
applyed to the Heart, but to the
Brain.</item>
               <item>5. That the Radical Moisture, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogenial
heat naturally ingrafted in us wastes
always by degrees from the time of our
Conception, as Oyl in a Lamp, or Wax in
a Taper: whereas till we come to the age of
Consistence, we still grow in bulk, in strength,
and stature: which for my own part I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
conceive how it should be, if from our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,
our Natural heat and moisture still de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased.</item>
               <item>6. That one hand by Nature is more use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and properly made for Action then the
other: whereas we find no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the two Eyes, the two Ears, the two No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strills;
and if Men were left to themselves, as
many I think, if not more, would use the left
hand, as now by education and custom do
the right: And in truth I am of Opinion
that God and Nature have given us two
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53586:49"/>
hands, that we should use both indifferently,
that if need required, the one might supply the
loss or defect of the other. Such would

to be, and such I do take those seven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<hi>Benjamite,</hi> to have been mentioned in the

these few stumbling blocks out of the way.
I shall next make good my promise according

in matter of Learning, ballanced; as also
that there is both in Wits and Arts, as in all
things besides, a kind of a circular progress,

have their rise and fall, increase and decrease,
and so through the Divine assistance I shall
set a period to this discourse.</p>
            <p>Since it is a received conclusion of the choice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
both Divines and Philosophers, that the
reasonable Soul of Man is not converted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him by his Parents, but infused immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the Creatour, and with all that the Souls
of all men, at their first Creation and Infusion,
are equal and perfect alike, endued with the
fame Essence and abilities, it must needs be,
that the inequality and disparity of actions,
which they produce, arise from the diverle
temper of the matter which they informe,
and by which, as by an instrument they work.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53586:57"/>
Now the matter being tempered by the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of the bodies of our Parents, the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of the Heavens, the quality of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Diet, Exercise, and the like, it remains,
that as there is a variety and Vicissitude or
these in regard of goodness, so is there like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in the temper of the matter, whereof we
consist, and the actions which by it our Souls
produce: yea, where both the Agents and
the instruments are alike, yet by the diversity
of education and Industry, their works are
many times infinitely diversified.</p>
            <p>The principal faculties of the Soul are Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
Judgment, and Memory. One of
the most famous for Memory amongst the
Ancients, was <hi>Seneca</hi> the Father, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of himself <hi>Proaemic, Lib. 1. Controver.</hi>
That he could repeat a thousand names, or
two hundred verses, brought to his Master
by his School fellows backwards or forwards.
But that which <hi>Muretus Lib. 3. Variar. Lection.</hi>
reports of a young Man of <hi>Corsica,</hi> a Student
in the Civil Law, whom himself saw, at <hi>Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua,</hi>
far exceeds it: he could, saith he recite
Thirty thousand Names in the same order as
they were delivered, without any stop or
staggering, as readily as if he had read them
out of a Book: his conclusion is <hi>Huic ego nec

whom I may set against him, unless <hi>Cyrus</hi>
perchance, whom <hi>Pliny, Quintillian,</hi> and other
Latin Writers, report to have remembred the
names of all his Souldiers, which yet <hi>Muretus</hi>
himself doubts was mistaken of them. <hi>Zeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi>
of whom only or principally they could
learn it, affirming only that he remembred
the names of his principal Captains, or chief
Commanders. And <hi>AEneus Sylvius,</hi> in his
History of the Council of <hi>Basil</hi> (at which
himself was present) tells us of <hi>Lodovicus
Pontanus</hi> of <hi>Spoleta,</hi> a Lawyer likewise by
Profession, (who dyed of the <hi>Pestilence</hi> at the
Council, at Thirty years of age) that he
could recite not the Titles only, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Bodies of the Laws, being for vastness
and fastness of Memory, <hi>Nemini Antiquorum
inferior,</hi> as he speaks, nothing inferiour to
any of the Ancients. <hi>Famianus Straeda,</hi> in his
first Book of <hi>Academical Prolusions,</hi> relates of
<hi>Francis Suar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>z,</hi> who had, saith he, so strong a
Memory, that he had <hi>St. Augustine</hi> (the most
copious and various of the Fathers) ready by
heart, alledging every where (as occasion
presented it self) fully and faithfully, his
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53586:58"/>
Sentences, and which is stranger, his very
words; nay, if he demanded any thing
touching any passage in any of his Volumes
(which of them will make a great shew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the filling of a Library) <hi>Statim quo
lequo, quaque pagina disseruerit ea super re expedite
docentem ac digito commonstrantem saepè videmus</hi>:
I my self have often seen him instantly
shewing and pointing with his Finger, to the
place and Page in which he disputed of that
Matter; this is, I confess, the Testimony of
one <hi>Jesuit</hi> touching another, but of <hi>Dr. Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds,</hi>
it is most certain, that he excelled this
way, to the astonishment of all that were
inwardly acquainted with him, not only for
St. <hi>Augustines</hi> works, but also all Classick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors:
so that as in this respect it might tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be said of him, which hath been apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to some others, that he was <hi>a living Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or a third University:</hi> for it hath been very
credibly reported of him, that upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of some writings which passed to and
fro, betwixt him and <hi>Dr. Gentilis,</hi> then a
professour in our Civil Laws, he publickly
professed, that he thought <hi>Dr. Reynolds</hi> had
read, and did remember more of those Laws
then himself, though it were his Profession,
in which he admirably excelled.</p>

And for the excellency of the other facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Mind, together with that of the
Memory, it is a wonderful Testimony that
<hi>Vines</hi> (a Man of eminent parts) in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
on the second Book, and 17. <hi>Cap.

which man, <hi>France</hi> never brought forth a
sharper wit, or pierceing judgment, of more
exact diligence, or greater Learning, nor in
this age <hi>Italie</hi> it self: And then going on tells
us, that there was nothing written in <hi>Greek</hi>
or <hi>Latin,</hi> which he had not turned over,
read and exmined; <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> were,
both alike to him, yet was he in both most
excellent, speaking either of them as readily,
and perchance with more ease then the <hi>French,</hi>
his Mother Tongue; he would read out a
<hi>Greek</hi> Book in <hi>Latin,</hi> and out of the <hi>Latin</hi>
Book into <hi>Greek.</hi> Those things which we

both in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> then (as he affirms)

Not to insit upon Supernaturals; were there
among us that industry, and the union of
forces, and contribution of helps, as was
in the Ancients, I see no sufficient Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
but the Wits of this present Age might
produce as great Effects as theirs did, nay
greater, inasmuch as we have the Light of
their Writings to guide and assist us: we
have books by reason of the Art and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of <hi>Printing</hi> more familiar, and at a
cheaper rate: most men being now unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to give Three hundred pounds for three
Books, as <hi>Plato</hi> did for those of <hi>Philolaus</hi> the
<hi>Pithagorean.</hi> And by this means are we
freed from a number of gross Errours, which
by the ignorance or negligence of unskilfull
Writers crept into the Text: yet on the
other side it is as true that we are forced to
spend much time in the learning of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
especially the <hi>Latin, Greek,</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi>
which the Ancients spent in the study
of things, their learning being commonly
written in their own Language. Besides
the infinite and bitter controversies amongst
Christians in matters of Religion since the
Infancie thereof even to these present times,
hath doubtless not a little hindered the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
and advancement of other Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:53586:62"/>
Likewise it cannot be denyed, but that the
incouragements for the study of Learning
were in former times greater. What libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and bountiful allowance did <hi>Alexander</hi>
afford <hi>Aristotle,</hi> Eight hundred Talents for
the entertainment of Fishers, Faulkners and
Hunters to bring him in Beasts, Fowls, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes
of all kinds, and for the discovery of
their several natures and dispositions: Nay,
the daily wages of <hi>Roscius</hi> the Stage-player,
as witnesseth <hi>Mucrobrius,</hi> in his <hi>Saturnal
Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> 14. was a thousand <hi>Dexarii</hi>
which amounteth to Thirty pounds of our
Coyn. And <hi>AEsop</hi> the <hi>Tragaedian</hi> by the
only exercise of the same Trade, if we may
credit the same Author, that he left his
Son above One hundred and fifty thousand
pounds Sterling, whereunto may be added,
that the Ancients copying out their Books,
for the most part with their own hand,
it could not but work in them a deeper im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of the matter therein contained,
and being thereby forced to content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with fewer Books, of nece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sity they
held themselves more closely to them.
And it is true what <hi>Seneca</hi> saith, as well in
reading as eating, <hi>Varietas delectat, certitudo
predest,</hi> Variety is delightful, but certainty
more useful and profitable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:53586:62"/>
So that upon the matter, reckonings cast
up on all sides, and one thing being set
against another, as we want some helps
which the Ancients had, so we are freed
from some hindrances wherewith they were
incumbred; as again it is most certain, that
they wanted some of our helps, and were
freed from some of our hindrances: if
then we come short of their perfections,
it is not because Nature is generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
in us, but because we are wanting
to our selves, and do not strive to make
use of, and improve those abilities where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
God and Nature hath endowed us.
