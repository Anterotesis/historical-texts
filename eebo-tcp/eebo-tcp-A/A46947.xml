            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Shewing that the Frequent meeting of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments is the Basis of our Constitution, and the True of the Government; and that the Intermission of them is Inconsistent with the Body of the English Law.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IF a Man would have an entire View of the English Constitution, he must have recourse to those Able and Approved Authors who have written Purposely on that Subject. For it is a Rule, <hi>Parva est Authoritas aliud Agentis;</hi> and what is said by the by, is of less Weight, than what is professedly handled; provided it have been Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely considered, by a Competent Judge of that Matter of which he treats. And in this kind we
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98941:4"/>
do not find a Man better Qualified than the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lord Chancellor <hi>Fortescue,</hi> who was an Aged Lawyer, and had been Lord Chief Justice of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> when he wrote his Book <hi>de laudibus Legum An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliae,</hi> which was on purpose in a Dialogue with the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> to inform him of the Nature of the English Constitution, and to let him know by what Sort of Laws the Realm, in which he was to Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed his Father, was to be Governed. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he adjures him over and over again to Addict himself to the Understanding of the Laws of his Father's Realm, wherein he was to Succeed, <hi>Fol.</hi> 16. <hi>a.</hi> and having shewed the Prince the Different nature of Reahns, where a King could Tyrannize, and where he could not, being restrained by Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Laws, <hi>Fol.</hi> 26. <hi>b.</hi> Rejoyce therefore (says he) most Excellent Prince and be glad, That the Law of the Realm in which you are to succeed is Such, for it shall exhibit and minister to You and your People no small Security and Comfort.</p>
               <p>But out of that excellent Book which I believe no way Warped, (for then it must lean towards the Court, partly because of the Flattery and Offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness which is too often found in Dialogues with Princes, and partly because the Author was retained on the Crown side by the Greatest Office in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>) I will confine my Self to those Passages only
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98941:4"/>
which relate to the Frequency of Parliaments. And the first I meet with is in his 18th Chap. concerning the Statutes of <hi>England</hi> in these words. <q>Et si Statuta haec, tantâ solemnitate &amp; prudentiâ edita, efficaciae tantae, quantae conditorum cupiebat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentio, non esse contingant: <hi>Concitò</hi> reformari ipsa possunt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> non sine Communitatis &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerum Regni illius assensu, quali ipsa primitùs emanarunt.</q> And if these Statutes fall short of their intended Efficacy, though devised with such great Solemnity and Wisdom of Parliament; they may very Quickly be Reformed, but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Assent of the Commons and Peers of the Realm, which was their Source from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
               <p>Now I only desire that the word <hi>Concitò</hi> may be taken notice of, which is the quickest Word that can be imagined, and shews that our Parliaments were always at Hand; and the whole Passage shews for what Wise and Just Reasons they were so.</p>
               <p>The next Passage is Chap. 53. <hi>Fol.</hi> 129. <hi>a.</hi> 
                  <q>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que leges Angliae frivolas &amp; infructuosas permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunt inducias. Et siquae in Regno illo dilatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in Placitis minùs accommodae fuerint usitatae, in Omni Parliamento amputari illae possunt: etiam &amp; Omnes Leges Aliae in Regno illo usi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatae, cum in aliquo <hi>Claudicaverint,</hi> in Omni Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamento
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98941:5"/>
poterunt Reformari. Quo recte con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludi potest, quod <hi>omnes Leges Regni illius Optimae, sunt in actu vel potentiâ,</hi> quo faciliter in actum duci poterunt &amp; in Essentiam realem. Ad quod fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciendum, quoties aequitas id poposcerit, singuli Reges ibidem Sacramento astringuntur, solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niter praestito tempore receptionis Diadematis sui.</q> Neither do the Laws of <hi>England</hi> allow in Law-suits frivolous and fruitless Delays. And if in this Kingdom Delays in Pleas which are not to the purpose should be used, they may in every Parliament be cut off. Yea, and all other Laws used in the Realm, when they <hi>Halt</hi> or are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in any point, they may in every Parliament be set to Rights. Whereupon it may be rightly, Concluded, that the Laws of <hi>England</hi> are the Best in the World, either Actually or Potentially, since they can easily be brought into Act or Being. To the performance whereof, as often as Equity so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, Every King is bound by an Oath solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken at the time of receiving his Crown.</p>
               <p>Out of this last Passage I will not trouble you with any more Observations than these;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That Parliaments are the Remedy against Delays in Law Proceedings: But how if Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments themselves should be Delayed?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:98941:5"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That if any or all our Laws should Halt, and our Parliaments at the same time should be Crippled too, and not able to come together; they could not help one another.</p>
               <p>In the next and last Chapter of that Book, <hi>Fol.</hi> 129. <hi>b.</hi> the Prince immediately replies. <q>
                     <hi>Princeps.</hi> Leges illas, nedum bonas sed &amp; optimas esse Cancellarie, ex prosecutione tuâ in hoc Dialogo certissimè deprehendi. Et siquae ex illis melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rari deposcant, id <hi>Citissimè</hi> fieri posse, Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum ibidem Formulae nos erudiunt. Quo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliter, potentialiterve, Regnum illud semper praestantissimis Legibus gubernatur. Nec tuas in hâc concionatione doctrinas futuris Angliae Regibus inutiles fore Conjicio; dum non de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectent regere legibus quae non delectant.</q> Says the Prince, My Lord Chancellor by the Tenour of your Discourse in this Dialogue I am throughly satisfied, that the Laws of <hi>England</hi> are not only Good, but the Best in the World. And in case any of the Laws want to be mended or improved, the Rules of the English Parliaments do instruct us, That that may be done forthwith. Whereupon the Realm of <hi>England</hi> is always Governed by the very best Laws, either in Reality or in Possibility. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides I conjecture that the Doctrines that have been held forth in this Dialogue will be very useful to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98941:6"/>
the Kings of <hi>England</hi> that shall come hereafter; since no Body likes to Govern by Laws which they do not like.</p>
               <p>After all these Lauds and Praises of the English Laws, which the Chancellor has stuck all over with Stars quite through his Book, and has made their Perfection to Center in this, that they either Are or Soon may be the Best in the World, because in case they labour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> any defect, that Fault may be Immediately amended by a wise Senate: What if that wise Senate be no where to be found; or is at no Certainty? It is then Impossible to render the Chancellor's Latin into English. For the speedy Perfection of the English Laws which the Prince and he are agreed is <hi>Concitò &amp; Citissimè,</hi> may be rendred, either at the Four Years end, or the Twelve Years end, or at the World's end. For so I am satisfied it was meant, after a Ten Year's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of Parliaments, if the Herb woman at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> had not thrown her Cricket-stool at the Arch-Bishop's Head. And so Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber does not so much acknowledge that Secret as Justify it. It is in his little Book of Observations upon <hi>Hammond L'Estrange's</hi> History of the Reign of K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. Says <hi>Hammond,</hi> upon the Dissolution of that wise Parliament in 28. (to whom we owe the Petition of Right) All wise Men concluded that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98941:6"/>
there was an end of all Parliaments. Yes, says <hi>Heylin,</hi> so they might well, the King having been troubled with their Impertinencies, and having an Example in <hi>France</hi> before his Eyes, where Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been so much discontinued, that it is become a Proverb amongst them, <hi>Voyons le Jeu de Trois Estats,</hi> as the strangest Sight which can be seen in an Age. I have not the Book now by me, but I will be answerable for the Substance of this Quotation, having retained this Passage in my Head above these Five and Twenty Years.</p>
               <p>I can only touch several other Arguments which might be enlarged upon. The High Court of Parliament is the Dernier Resort in this Kingdom; and if that fail, there may be a failure of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Justice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bracton</hi> says of an Ambiguous or Difficult Cause, <hi>Respectuetur ad magnam Curiam;</hi> but unless Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be Frequent, such a Cause is Adjourned to a long Day.</p>
               <p>Every Body that understands the English Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution knows that it is exactly the same as it was laid down in Parliament 8 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. by the Lord Chancellour that then was. You have it in Sir <hi>Robert Cotton's</hi> Abridgment of the Rolls in the <hi>Tower, p.</hi> 682. in these words. <q>He then declared the three Estates to comprehend the Governance of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98941:7"/>
this Land, the Preheminence whereof was to the King as chief, the second to the Lords and  Bishops, and the third to the Commons.</q> Now if we are at a loss or uncertainty about our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, we are at a loss or uncertainty about two Thirds of our Government.</p>
               <p>But I will say no more upon this Head, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to shew in the following Chapters, how the matter of Parliaments stood in former Ages.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>I Chuse to begin with this Period of Time in King <hi>Alfred's</hi> Reign, because we have clear Law and History to shew how Parliaments stood in his Time, and what Law was Ordained concerning them for ever.</p>
               <p>It is in the Mirror of Justices, which as my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> says in his Preface to his Tenth Reports, was written in the Saxon Times, and it appears by the Book it self: But several things were added to it by a Learned and Wise Lawyer <hi>Andrew Horne,</hi> who

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98941:8"/>
and receive Right by certain Usages and holy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. By this Estate were made many Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by several Kings down to the King that is now; (which says the Margin was <hi>Edward</hi> the First): which Ordinances are disused by some that are not so wise, and for want that they are not put into Writing and published in Certain.</p>
               <p>In this Passage the Two Times a Year seem to be Stationary; the Calling a Parliament Oftner than Two Times a Year <hi>if need were,</hi> is plainly intended for Contingencies of State, and when the <hi>Ardua Regni,</hi> or Extraordinary Affairs of the Nation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an Extraordinary Parliament. I say, and will make out to all the World, by Laws and Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Parliament, that the King has a Power of calling Parliaments within the Law; But I never did, nor never will say to the end of my Life, that the King can hinder Parliaments Appointed by Law. These Frequent Parliaments were to meet at <hi>London</hi> in Time of Peace. We see then what has inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted our Parliaments both as to Time and Place. For <hi>London</hi> was after in the hands of the Dane, and Foreigners Wars and Tribulations came on.</p>
               <p>But the best way is to let an Author explain himself, which the <hi>Mirror</hi> does in telling us like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Abusions of the Law, or the Contrarieties and Repugnancies to Right, or as he calls it, the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98941:8"/>
Fraud and Force which is put upon Law. This way of writing Law is the best that can be inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for it is the way of Preaching by Positive and Negative, which is a two-edged Sword, and cuts both ways. And the Truth of it is, the Negative part of the Law, which lies in a little Compass, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes teaches us a world of the Positive. For instance the 33 Articles in the Roll, 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>m.</hi> 20. which K. <hi>Richard</hi> the 2d. solemnly acknowledged of his own Male-administration, do give us more light into the Constitution, than a Book of six times the bigness could do.</p>

               <p>From this Passage I shall only observe, that the Place of a Parliament's meeting is Fixed, and still at <hi>London;</hi> And that the Two Times a Year was stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>The next is <hi>p.</hi> 93. of the same Bock, 36. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <q>The Print touching the Yearly holding of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, <hi>cap.</hi> 10. agreeth with the Record.</q> Now the Print is, <q>

               </p>
               <p>Now that Statute, as I find by the Statute-Book, for I cannot find it in Sir <hi>Robert Cotton,</hi> is thus. 4 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. <q>
                     <hi>Item,</hi> it is accorded, that a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament shall be holden every Year Once, and more Often if need be.</q>

By the Reason given in the 36 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. just now recited for a Yearly Parliament, one would think it should be a Daily Parliament; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is for the Maintenance of former <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, and Redress of divers Mischiefs which Daily hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen: But I believe that a Parliament which Sits but Forty Days in the Year are able to do that Work; Concerning which we will enquire further after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>In the 50 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 138. The Parliament's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or Petition is this, <q>That a Parliament may be holden every Year; the Knights of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament may be chosen by the whole Counties; and that the Sheriff may likewise be without brokage in Court.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The King's Answer is this. <q>To the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there are Statutes made therefore; To the Sheriffs there is answer made; To the Knights it is agreed, that they shall be chosen by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Consent of every County.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After these Three Laws in <hi>Ed. 3d's</hi> Time, we come to the First of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, <hi>p.</hi> 163. where the Petition or Demand for a Yearly Parliament is this. <q>That a Parliament may be Yearly holden in convenient place, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress Delays in Suits, and to end such Cases as the Judges doubt of.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:98941:10"/>
The King's Answer is. <q>It shall be as it hath been used.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the 2 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 173. By the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment one Cause of opening the Parliament is Declared to be this. <q>Secondly, for that it was enacted that a Parliament should Yearly be holden.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, if the Court insist upon a Yearly Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Country may and ought.</p>
               <p>Thus stood the Law of <hi>England</hi> till the 16 <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roli</hi> 1. when that King having discontinued Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments for Twelve Years, and created a Distrust of him in the Breasts of his People which was Just; (for if a Prince spoil the Government for Twelve Years together, who shall Trust him in the Thirteenth?) The Nation found a Necessity of having a Cautionary Parliament every Third Year, to secure their Annual Parliaments for the Two Years immediately foregoing. This is the true Reason of the Act for a Triennial Parliament, which was a perfect Innovation both Name and Thing. For I challenge any Antiquary, Lawyer, or Person whatsoever that has turned over Books, to shew me the word Triennial joined to the word Parliament, from the Foundation of this Government till the Year 1640. A Triennial Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament therefore is so far from being the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98941:11"/>
of this Government, that if it were so, a great number of our present Lords and Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are Older than the Constitution, and were Born before it. But as I said before, that Act was only a Cautionary Act, as a Town or Gate of a City is taken in Caution, for performance of Articles. This appears by the first thing which is Enacted in that Law, namely, <hi>That the Laws for a Parliament to be holden at least once a Year, shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be duly Kept and Observed.</hi> Scobel's <hi>Coll.</hi> 16 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>This Act was Gently drawn up, and had more of a Prospect than a Retrospect, and does not look back into those Oppressions which King <hi>Charles</hi> himself in his large Declaration of <hi>August</hi> the 12th does acknowledge were Insupportable; which were wholly owing to this long Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Parliaments: but it wisely provides, that in case the two first Years Parliaments should fail, then came a Peremptory Parliament, which the King and Keeper might call if they pleased; but if they did not, the Counties and Burroughs of <hi>England</hi> were forced to send. It is an Act that exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes it self, like our Act for Burying in Woollen; and he that will see the Wisdom of it, may read it where I have quoted it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:98941:11"/>
After this comes the Act 16 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. and repeals this Triennial Act, because say they, <q>It is in Derogation of his Majesty's just Rights and Prerogative, inherent to the Imperial Crown of this Realm for the Calling and Assembling of Parliaments; whereupon the Triennial Act is Annulled as if it had never been made.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I wish it had never been made. But we will stop there first. It is annulled as if it had never been made: There is nothing lost by that; for then our Parliaments are where they were, which was Due Annual.</p>
               <p>Well now let us see what Alteration is made by this New Act, 16 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. which follows in these words, <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <q>And because by the Ancient Laws and Statutes of this Realm, made in the Reign of K. <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d, Parliaments are to <note place="margin">4 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 14. 36 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 10.</note> be held very often, (that is once or twice a Year)</q> Therefore they shall not be Discontinued above Three Years at the most. I do not use to Admire Consequences which I do not understand. But under favour, I would be taken right. I say, that the Recital of the Ancient Laws of this Realm does not Repeal them, Disannul them, <hi>anneantir,</hi> any thing, nothing; when there is not one <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing</hi> Word concerning them in that Statute.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:98941:12"/>
I knew what I said when I wished the Triennial Bill of Forty had never been made; and it must be remembred that that Act is as if it had never been made; For it gave occasion to some Men that came in with the Deluge of the Restauration, when it rained Cavaliers, (though I value all Mens Rights more than my own, and Princes most because they are biggest) and it prompted them to think of turning a Cautionary Triennial, into a Discretio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. But God be thanked they wanted Words to express themselves; and if they meant it, they have not done it.</p>
               <p>But so as they did put the Act together, and as it now stands, there are several things in it worth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving. 1st, That <hi>if there be occasion there shall be more and oftner</hi> Parliaments, than once in Three Years. Now I ask for whose sake was that Clause Enacted? Not for the King's, for he was always enabled by his Prerogative, for the sake of the <hi>Ardua Regni,</hi> to call a Parliament every Month in the Year: Well then it was for the sake of his People, that if they judged <hi>there was Occasion for more or Oftner</hi> Parliaments, they might ask for them. For I appeal to Common Sense, whether it be not Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, and wonderfully beneath the Dignity of a Parliament, when a Prince was bound by his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation Oath to Call a Parliament Once a Year,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98941:12"/>
or oftner if need were, (for so the Law stood, and so this Prince was at that time Bound) to Interpret a Law after such a manner, as to say he was Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to call a Parliament Oftner than once in Three Years.</p>
               <p>So much for that Point; the next is this. The The Upshot of this Act of Parliament, and the Conclusion of the whole Act is in these words. <q>To the end, there may be a frequent Calling, Assembling, and Holding of Parliaments once in Three Years at the least.</q> I do say, that if ever we came to Low-water Mark in our Laws about Parliaments, and if ever they run Dregs, it was in the Time of <hi>Charles</hi> the 2d. And yet it was enacted, and was the End of that Law, that One should be Called, Once in Three Years at the least. Now I leave it to the Lawyers to tell, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Proclamation can call a Parliament, or any thing else besides a Writ of Summons and a Writ for Elections?</p>
               <p>And thus have I run through the Law of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments till t'other Day, and considered what is the Law at present. From King <hi>Alfred's</hi> Time down to <hi>Edward</hi> the First, it seems to have been the stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Law to have Parliaments Twice a Year. I know that the Invasions of several Nations both Danes and Normans, and the Revolutions and

Disturbances of State which happened, must needs cause frequent Interruptions in the practice of it. But my reason to be of that Opinion is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Horne</hi> who lived in those Times, says, That Parliaments at that Time ought to meet twice a Year, and that at <hi>London,</hi> and that the Intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Parliaments was the Greatest Abusion of the Law but one. Though I think I have still a Greater Authority than <hi>Horn's,</hi> (if any thing in this World can be bigger than that of an Able and Honest Man); But it is a King in his Letter to the Pope. It is in the Clause Rolls <hi>Anno</hi> 3. <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. <hi>m.</hi> 9. <hi>Cedula.</hi> and is to be seen in <hi>Prynne's</hi> large Book <hi>p.</hi> 158. I will quote no more of it than is for my purpose. It is concerning the Yearly Tribute of a Thousand Marks which the Popes from K. <hi>John's</hi> Time claimed, and there were several Years Due. The Pope's Nuncio sollicites the Matter, but the King excuses himself that he had come to no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution in his <hi>Easter-Parliament,</hi> but by Common Advice he would give him an Answer in his <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmass-Parliament</hi> next following. At present I only mind the wording and way of expressing these two Parliaments. Concerning the First he says, <q>In Parliamento quod circa <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98941:13"/>
Used to be held in <hi>England</hi> about the Octaves of <hi>Easter.</hi> That word <hi>Consuevit</hi> amounts to Custom and Usage, and seems to express a Parliament <hi>de More.</hi> He says, That the Parliament <hi>was in Octabis,</hi> and by Occasion of his Sickness, (after they had made several good Laws and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> many Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, but not all that lay before them) for the Reason aforesaid, That Parliament was Dissolved, and the King could not treat with them about the Pope's Petition of Tribute.

               <p>THERE are several ways of proving that there was a New Election every Year.

No, I will go no farther than this last Letter to shew that there is a great Appearance that while there were Two Parliaments in a Year, the Second must be new Called. Though I hate the word New applied to a Parliament; for a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is a Parliament, and our Ancestors would no more have dream'd of a Stale or Old Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than of an Old Moon cut out into Stars.

But before we could put an end to that Parliament, because of the Multitude of Grievances which lay before them, your Nuncio in the mean time dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently Solliciting your Business, a great Distemper as it pleased God befel me, which hindered the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98941:15"/>
finishing of many other Matters, and treating about the Petition of the Yearly Tribute, which is a great Grief to me; and so by reason of my said Illness, (from which by the Grace of God, in whose Hands are the Issues of Life and Death, I begin to Recover) That Parliament was Dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and hereupon I could not Treat with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and Peers aforesaid about this Tribute.</p>
               <p>From this long Quotation I shall only make this Observation at present, That in this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment begun in the Octaves of <hi>Easter</hi> (perhaps up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>May-Day</hi>) there was a great deal of Business done, and a great deal of Business left undone; amongst the rest the Pope's, because of the King's Sickness, who thereupon could not give Answers to Bills or Petitions; and that the Nuncio's Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was Unanswered, went to the King's Heart. But upon Occasion of that Sickness it was that the Parliament was <hi>Dissolved,</hi> and the Pope's Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness hindred, to the King's great Regret. What, could not the King keep this Parliament alive till the Nineteenth of <hi>June,</hi> when he himself began to be well again, which is the Date of the Letter? It is no more than Fifty Days from their first sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down to the Date of his Letter, and yet though he set his Heart upon the Business that lay before that Parliament, it was Dissolved; and to stop
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98941:15"/>
that Gap he promises to call Another Parliament at <hi>Michaelmass.</hi> Then it seems they did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Method of Prorogations, and it is unknown to me by what Law it came in. If there be such a Law, I never minded it, for I am speaking of the Constitution, and not of Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>But I believe the true Reason of the Abrupt Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folution of that Summer Parliament in Conjunction with the King's Sickness, was this, That if they had been held till <hi>Michaelmass,</hi> though thore was then to be Another Parliament, it must have been at the King's Charge. For I am of Opinion by what I have seen even as low as <hi>Richard</hi> the 2d's Time, that the Sitting of a Parliament was usually Forty Days and that the Quarantain was not duly kept in this Parliament 3 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. of the Octaves of <hi>Easter.</hi> But there was a Concern in holding a Parliament above Forty Days about the Knights and Burgesses Wages.

               <p>Now what is the meaning of these Forty Days, but that they had waited a Just Session? And how should the Parliament-Mens Wages be otherwise adjusted, when at the end of every Parliament in those Times they were dismissed, with desiring them to sue out their Writs for their Wages? And I leave it to the Antiquaries, because I am not now able to Travel in that Point, to consider how the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Proportions of Land which are allotted for the Knights and Burgesses in several Counties for their Wages, can be adjusted, without a Certainty of the Length of their Sessions.</p>
               <p>But not a word of this is my present Business, which was to shew that Parliaments by the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution are not to be Stale; as I have seen one in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98941:16"/>
my Time retained about Nineteen Years with Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and another for fewer Years with Places and turning out of Places: But if a Parliament were corrupted neither of these ways, yet a standing Parliament will always Stagnate, and be like a Country-pond which is over-grown with Ducks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat. The worst King one of them that ever the Nation had, was so limited by the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he did not know how to compass a long Parliament, and therefore he was fain to take other indirect Ways to gain the same Point as if he had one.

               </argument>
               <p>AT last I am come to search after the Head of <hi>Nile,</hi> and the true old Land-mark of the English Constitution. How Parliaments stood in the British times I am not so certain; but that there were Parliaments then, I am certain. I have it from the wise <hi>Gildas,</hi> that <hi>Vortigern</hi> and his foolish <hi>Thaynes</hi> sent to the Saxons for help against the Picts
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98941:18"/>
and Scots, and took into their Bosoms a Warlike and Fierce Nation, whom at a distance they were afraid of. And they indeed of Course beat those that infested <hi>Severus's</hi> Wall, but they made mine Hosts that invited them in, Hewers of Wood and Drawers of Water. And those of the Britains that opposed them, the Saxons drove out of their Countrey, whereby as <hi>Gildas</hi> says all their Records were lost. But out of that Venerable Author we plainly see, that the Lamentable Letter which was sent the Year before to the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> was Written by a British Parliament. For whose sake I beg of all Nations not to let in Legions of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Nations to be their Masters, for when they want them and their Protection most, they shall go without it. For when the Roman Legions were withdrawn out of <hi>Britany,</hi> (which caused our Enemies to make an Insult) and the British Parliament begg'd hard to have them return, the Roman Senate's Answer was, that they were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise engaged; and they must help themselves as they could, which made them betake themselves to the Saxons. A very fair Answer to a Nation that was disabled and disarmed, after their Kings and Parliaments had been only Tax-gatherers to the Romans for several Hundreds of Years; as if you have no True Lord Mayor, you must still have
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98941:18"/>
Pageants, and somewhat that keeps up the Shew.</p>
               <p>But after these Early Times, we have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor's Laws, which all succeeding Kings have been Sworn to, which I will try what to make of. It is an Yearly <hi>Folk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote</hi> upon the Kalends of <hi>May.</hi> I do not know readily what that Yearly <hi>Folkmote</hi> is, because those Laws of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor say that King <hi>Arthur</hi> Invented it; <hi>Quod Arthurus Rex inclytus Britonum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venit.</hi> Then I am sure the Original Name of it was not <hi>Folkmote.</hi> Then we will mind the Name no more, but come to the Thing.</p>

All the Laymen are sworn in the Presence of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops into a Mutual Covenant with one another, into their Fealty to the King, and to Preserve the Rights of the Kingdom. They Consult of the Common Safety, of Peace, of War, and of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the Publick Profit.</p>
               <p>It follows in the next words, <q>Adhibetur prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terca Folcmotum in repentino omni discrimine, exigente etiam necessitate, sub Aldermanno (hoc est Comite) cujuslibet Comitatus.</q> Besides a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98941:19"/>
                  <hi>Folkmote</hi> is used in every suddain Danger, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise if Necessity require it, under the Alderman (that is the Earl) of every County.</p>
               <p>This last is plainly a Provincial <hi>Folkmote</hi> in time of Necessity; but the former part of the Sentence seems to intimate, that upon a Surprize when the King had not time to call a Parliament, the last <hi>Folkmote</hi> met; as the last <hi>Westminster</hi> Parliament did, to give the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before it was Possible to have a Parliament Elected.</p>
               <p>Though the former Description of the General and not the Provincial <hi>Folkmote</hi> is our present Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And at the first sight it looks like a Full Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, for it consists of the <hi>Princes, as well Bishops as Magistrates, and the Freemen;</hi> that is to say, the Chiefs of the whole Nation. And they are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in Parliament-work, for <hi>they Consult of the Common Safety, of Peace, of War, and promoting the Publick Profit.</hi> And did not the General Title of our Laws every Session run thus; To the High Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, and to the Profit of the Common-Wealth? If ever there were Wites in Parliament, sure it was <hi>Princes, as well Bishops as Magistrates, and the Freemen.</hi> Why then does this Learned Knight distinguish betwixt a <hi>Wittenagemote</hi> and a <hi>Folkmote,</hi> seeing they were both made up of Wites? I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98941:20"/>
by Things and not by Words, and am throughly satisfied that an Assembly which does Parliament-Business is a Parliament. And no doubt the <hi>Folkmote</hi> made Laws; for it is not to be supposed that an Assembly of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should sit Consulting Forty Days of Peace and War, of Armies and Fleets, (which in those Days were Three Thousand Ships, and were able to make out the Dominion of the Seas); of the Grievances of the Nation, and the Redress of those Grievances; and of Providing for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Profit of the Realm; and after all not to be able to enact their own Conclusions. That is just as if our present Parliament should spend Forty Days in finding out Ways and Means for the raising Money, and afterwards were not able to put them into a Law: Or as we Private Men use to Consult and Debate, and Settle the Nation over a Dish of Coffee, without being able to oblige one single Man to our Orders.</p>
               <p>The Thing which misled this Great Antiquary (as I conjecture) to make this Mark of Difference betwixt a <hi>Folkmote</hi> and a <hi>Wittenagemote,</hi> as if a <hi>Witte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagemote</hi> made Laws and a <hi>Folkmote</hi> nor, is this; That when the Saxon Kings issued out their Laws, they said they had passed in their <hi>Wittenagemote, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilio Sapientum,</hi> or Council of Wise Men: And it
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98941:20"/>
was proper for the King to call his <hi>Folkmote</hi> by that Name, though not for them themselves. As for Instance, the Writs of Election at this Day call for some of the <hi>Discreetest</hi> to be chosen to Parliament, though the Members do not assume that Title: And I know so much of the Old English Genius, that they would no more have called themselves a <hi>Wittenagemote,</hi> than this present Parliament would call their Votes which come out Day by Day, <hi>Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal de Sqavans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I will wave Conjectures even in Antiquities, (though we are there oftentimes forced to go in the Dark, to tread upon Ruins, and to feel out our Way;) because I have direct Proof that the <hi>Folk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote</hi> made all the Laws we ever had. And for this I will go no farther than to the third Branch of the Usual and Accustomed Coronation Oath taken by the former Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and taken twice by <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. Membr. 20. <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Decem Scriptores,</hi> p. 2746. in these words, spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the King by way of Question. <q>Conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis justas Leges &amp; Consuetudines esse tenendas; &amp; promittis per te esse protegendas &amp; ad hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem Dei corroborandas quas Vulgus elegerit, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum vires tuas? <hi>Respondebit,</hi> Concedo &amp;  promitto.</q> Do you grant that the just Laws and Customs which are of the Folks Chusing shall
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98941:21"/>
be kept, and do you promise that they shall be Protected, and to the Honour of God receive Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance by you, to the utmost of your Power? <hi>The King shall Answer,</hi> I Grant and Promise.</p>
               <p>Now I would fain know, How a <hi>Folkmote</hi> can be otherwise expressed in Latin than by the Word <hi>Vulgus,</hi> which is a Collective Word: Or how the <hi>Vulgus</hi> or Folk could chuse Laws any otherwise than in a <hi>Folkmote?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will not enter into the stiff Dispute which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised King <hi>Charles</hi> the First and his Parliament for a long time, whether the word was <hi>Praeter Tense</hi> or <hi>Future,</hi> and whether the Word was best rendred in the French Translations, the Laws which the Folk <hi>auront esleu,</hi> shall have chosen, or which the Folk <hi>eslieront</hi> shall hereafter Chuse; whereupon they said that he was bound to Sign and Affirm all the Laws they should hereafter present to him, and that he could not make use of a Negative without Perjury. I say that that whole Dispute was not worth a Farthing. For if the Folk Chose the Laws all along down to King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second's Time, and the Kings were sworn to Affirm them, then we know how the Laws antiently were made; And who cares whether <hi>Eslieront</hi> or Choosing for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be the Sense of the Word or no? For if the Folks Choosing was the Constitution in K. <hi>Richard</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:98941:21"/>
the Second's Time, then I would fain know in what King's Reign it was afterwards that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution was altered.</p>
               <p>In short, the Folk Chose the Laws; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the English <hi>Folkmote</hi> and <hi>Wittenagemote</hi> will be found to be old <hi>Homer's</hi> River,

               <p>I cannot but say there was some Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Folkmote</hi> upon the Kalends of <hi>May,</hi> and the <hi>Folkmotes</hi> which the King always called for his <hi>Ardua Contingentia</hi> or Contingencies of State: But the Difference lay only in this, that the <hi>Folkmote</hi> of the Kalends of <hi>May</hi> was a Parliament <hi>de more,</hi> and of Course, who Assembled themselves, <hi>sub initio Kalendarum Maii,</hi> says <hi>Spelman,</hi> and were bound to do so, <hi>in Capite Kal.

Other Difference I can find none. For as for the Constituent Parts of a <hi>Folkmote,</hi> if <hi>the Princes of the</hi>

This is an undoubted Prerogative lodged in the King for the sake of the <hi>Ardua Contingentia;</hi> and no Man would Govern a Kingdom that could not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Advice and Assistance of his Subjects to be forthcoming, when the Occasions of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom required it. And for the sake of these <hi>Ardua Negotia,</hi> the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses are to be Impowered to Act in Parliament-Business by those that sent them; lest for want of that full and sufficient Power, or by means of an Improvident

               </argument>
               <p>BEfore I proceed any further I must clear one Point. And that is, that we find the Author and Founder of our Yearly <hi>Folkmote</hi> mentioned in the Laws of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, (which were Recited and Confirmed by K. <hi>William</hi> the First) under the Title <hi>De Greve, Chap.</hi> 35. which may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly leave a Suspicion that this Yearly <hi>Folkmote</hi> of the Kalends of <hi>May</hi> was a <hi>Greve's</hi> Court. Now what Court should this be, belonging to a <hi>Greve,</hi> or any Count or Viscount, or President whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, for <hi>Greve</hi> is an Ambiguous Word? It is not

a Burghmote, for that is Three times a Year by the Saxon Laws.

               <p>The next thing to be considered is the Author or Founder of this Ancient Constitution, which we have in the aforesaid <hi>Chap. De Greve,</hi> Num. 35. amongst the Laws of Good King <hi>Edward.</hi> 
                  <q>Hanc Legem Invenit Arthurus, qui quondam fuit

               <p>It is good to Honour the Founders of all Useful Constitutions; and I believe that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Arthur</hi> was the Inventor of this as to this Realm; because these Laws of K. <hi>Edward</hi> say so: And so was <hi>Cadmus</hi> the Inventor of Letters in <hi>Greece,</hi> though we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

For if it be <hi>Aleph, Beth, Gimel, Daleth</hi> in one Place, and in the same Order it is <hi>Alpha, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, Gamma, Delta</hi> in the other Place, then we are sure there has been an Understanding and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. For it is impossible to be otherwise when the Alphabets are settled on both Sides, by being their Numeral Letters; as it was plainly in King <hi>David's</hi> Time by the Octonaries of the <hi>119th Psalm,</hi> as it stands in the middle of the Bible; and as it was in <hi>Homer's</hi> Time in <hi>Greece;</hi> or else the Old Scholiasts have deceived me, who say that <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> purposely couched the Number of all his Books in the first Word of his <hi>Iliads</hi>

Which Numerals stand for 48. The Greeks like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise taught the Welch to tell Twenty, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they taught the Romans too. Now by the same Rule, if there was a very Ancient <hi>Folkmote</hi> in the Neighbouring Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> upon every Kalends of <hi>May,</hi> then perhaps King <hi>Arthur</hi> bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from them; and it is good to look upon their Kalends, because it is possible they may give Light to Ours.</p>

            <p>And thus I have finished what I at first propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; but under such difficulties and disadvantages of a broken Health, as I do verily believe never Book was Written. And for that Reason, I am certain that the very Great Personages to whom I ventured to Offer it, (though it was upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of a better Performance) will bear with it; to whom I wholly Submit it with all Defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: and if one single Word of it should happen to be against Law, I here revoke it before hand. And for the same Reason I earnestly desire all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquaries and Learned Men to look further into this Matter, because I my self cannot: And as they see Cause, either to Confirm or Confute my Notion, which is Indifferent to me, because I only seek Truth. I do not speak thus doubtingly concerning Annual Parliaments, for I am Positive in them; but if People will have the utmost of Antiquities, and the very Original of the Wisest and Justest Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the World, they must sometimes be content to Read with Letters that are somewhat Worn; Though I have been of Opinion for many a Year, that the Kalends of <hi>May</hi> were very Legible. And

I am sure that I have by this Time gained my Point, which was to set Wiser Men upon Thinking.</p>
            <p>I was afraid that this Government would float and move upon the Face of the Waters, till we were at a certainty about our Parliaments; and therefore when I waited upon my Lord <hi>Devonshire</hi> before the Coronation, and it is my Fault I have not done it often since, I said that we were never the Better for this Revolution till we had a Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Parliaments, and our Ancient Right was Anniversary Parliaments, and that nothing else could set the Government to rights. Knowing how much he had Assisted the King, and seeing the white Staff in his Hand, I concluded upon his Interest with the King, and therefore said; My Lord, you may make a Complement of this Matter to the King, and tell him that we must have Good Laws, in a Good Reign, or never, for we cannot have them in a Bad one; but the Laws made in a Good Reign are to support us when a bad one comes, as the seven Years of Plenty in <hi>Egypt,</hi> sustained the seven Years of Famine. It breaks no Rules to repeat my own Discourse to his Lordship, and to say that he gave me the hearing, nor to say that a certain Knight pulled me by the Sleeve, which had no other Effect than to make me speak the more, and the

more earnestly to my Lord in that matter.</p>
            <p>Likewise when Mr. <hi>Johnston</hi> the present Secretary of State for <hi>Scotland,</hi> told me in the Court of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, that the Bill of Rights was going up to the House of Lords, I wish'd at that Time that all the Rights were reduced to One Line which was our Right, To have a Parliament every Kalends of <hi>May.</hi> I tell these old Stories to shew that I was always of the same Mind, and that no Court neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects nor disappointments have Altered me; and I will Love this Court whether they will or no, for I am sure that I laid the Bridg that brought them over, and am pretty certain that they did not come hither in Virtue of <hi>Passive-Obedience.</hi>
