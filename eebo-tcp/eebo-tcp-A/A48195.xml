            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A LETTER to a
Member of Parliament
On the Account of some present Transactions.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>HONOVRED SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Experience I have had of your impartial dealings, encouraged me to
make this Address to you; and however assuming if may be thought, yet I
am sure 'tis no unseasonable Application: how unhappy soever the several
late turns of our Affairs have been, I am sensible you have had no share in
them, and therefore when any of those Transactions are brought upon the Stage, I
dare in every thing appeal to you as an unprejudiced Spectator.</p>
            <p>What you have hitherto done, I doubt: not is the Effect of a most deliberate Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
and tho' some Objections are made, yet I hope that evident Necessity, which is
always able to over-rule Forms, will easily justifie the Integrity of your Actions.</p>
            <p>Most Men are by this time satisfied that Popery and Slavery are Vanquished, and that
nothing is wanting but a healing Cordial to settle the Constitution, after the strains of a
violent Purgation; But in some Men the Humours are so floating, that when one angry
part is relieved, another immediately becomes uneasie; and this unhappiness of Temper
is so afflicting, that there can never be a perfect state of Health, when by all the Leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
you apply, you cannot make the Pain leave the Man, but only change its station.</p>
            <p>I was in hopes that our present good Fortune would have made all Protestants so
loving, that the memory of former Injuries could never sowre their good Nature; since
Men of all divisions among them have been unwarily injurious to each other; this should
facilitate their Reconciliation, and instead of ripping up old Sores, should rather hide
those, which perhaps may appear of a greener Complexion. 'Tis too much like the
common Artifice of Scolding to be quick in throwing Calumnies: and 'twas only the
Thief that never entered into Paradice, who could upbraid when he himself was in the
same Condemnation.</p>
            <p>I must confess, there are some Dealings, that are enough to ferment even the Blood
of a <hi>Stoick:</hi> to hear a Regulator Cant against Surrendring of Charters; to find a Man
accused of holding Correspondence with Papists, by one that sat at Meat with the Pope's
<hi>Nuncio;</hi> to see a late Addressor (who in spite of all Laws, would allow of the Dispensing
Power) furious for some disputable Customs in particular Corporations; I say to see
Men under these Circumstances prosecuting some few Miscarriages, which are so old,
that nothing but Malice could remember; must tempt a Man to believe that either they
have no sense of their own Faults, or else that they are afraid to be call'd to account, and
so by putting others first, would willingly Postpone their Punishment.</p>
            <p>I am told that Sir <hi>I. M—r,</hi> Sir <hi>W. P—d,</hi> and some others, are accused for Male
Administration in their Offices Seven or Eight years since: So stale a Resentment is not
worthy of your Consideration; and since their Accusers are so good at Recollecting of
Crimes, I wonder they had not run back to Original Sin, and prosecuted them for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Progeny of <hi>Adam:</hi> this Fault is much more demonstrable; and if Regeneration
be an Excuse, they can in the other Case too produce variety of Pardons.</p>
            <p>But when the Matter comes before you, I do not doubt but you will transfer such
trivial Grievances to their proper place, and not suffer private Peeks to disturb the Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
of three Kingdoms: This Business is become the Discourse of the whole Town,
and doubtless shortly will be that of the Country too; some rejoyce at these Gentlemen's
Misfortune; others, and perhaps the more considerate, are exceeding Sorry; such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
of Passions must needs be very clashing, and not fit Ingredients for that happy
Union, which His Majesty has graciously designed.</p>
            <p>And indeed such unhappy Recollections must needs breed ill blood; for these Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's
Actions for which they are Accused, have been Countenanced by many, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of by most; so that the Censures you pass upon them, will vertually reach all
the rest, and upon a fair Poll they will be found too numerous to be disobliged.</p>
            <p>If several of those Men to whom this Passage may be very pleasing, should perhaps
since the Date of these Miscarriages, be found themselves Criminal in a higher Degree;
these provoking Accusations may tempt Men to bring on further Complaints, and when
<pb facs="tcp:93526:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you are once beset with Indictments, (besides the loss of your time) you must either lye
under the Censure of being Partial, or extend your Animadversions perhaps further than
you at first intended.</p>
            <p>The great Objection against these Gentlemen is, That what they did, was to serve
a Popish Interest: I must confess that I think the Papists have been a long time under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
us, but I believe when these Gentlemen were in Office, they lay deeper under
Ground than they have done some time since, when others became the Favourites; and
when the design began visibly to appear, they worthily refus'd their Assistance: So that
how foul soever you may fall upon their mastakes, their Integrity is Spotless; and
tho excess of Loyalty might induce them to be influenced by the King, 'tis plain they
had nothing to do with the Papists.</p>
            <p>If these Gentlemen consented to some things which were fatal in their consequence,
'tis plain that others receiv'd what they had done, and improved them to greater incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies:
They are accused for an undue Choice of two Sheriffs, others had consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to put upon us four Parliament Men by illegal Elections; now after a due conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Circumstances, that which appears to be the most dangerous mistake, ought
in reason to be the Subject of your first Enquiry; and then in common construction,
which do you think is most to blame, he that unwarily sets a House on Fire, or another
who feeds the Flame when he sees it kindled.</p>
            <p>Perhaps those Persons who would have you censure these Gentlemen, may think their
crimes to be Notorious, and that there is nothing to be found on their own side but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence.
Whereas 'tis difficult to imagine, that men in such great heats, always kept
within their due compass; and if Men of all sides have been faulty, this unreasonable
Prosecution will oblige these Gentlemen to discover for their defence, what they are
willing to conceal out of Charity; so that the natural consequence of this contest, will
be the reviving of old Quarrels, the very thoughts of which to an honest Man must be
but a very uncomfortable prospect.</p>
            <p>To prosecute old Grudges, at a time when we have Criminals of so high a Nature to
encounter, will be both a scandal to our selves, and a comfort to our Enemies; 'twill
shew that revenge with us is not so much a Passion, as a Principle; and that we can at
any time let Popery gather strength, so that we can but humble one another. Indeed
these Gentlemens Accusers may think it too early to call to Account the late Instruments
of our Miseries, and since crimes are to be punished according to their Antiquity, ten
Years hence may be the proper time of their reckoning. But wise and indifferent Men
will think that crimes are to be considered, more according to their bulk than standing;
for an old fault has lost its Malignity, time has wiped off the Stain, and the man is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Innocent by Prescription; so that to pursue a man with Anger, after a long Truce
and a tacit Reconciliation, is neither Just nor Generous; 'tis too much like <hi>French</hi> Faith,
to fall upon the Allies as soon as the common Enemy is vanquished.</p>
            <p>Neither can it be for the Interest of their Majestys, to have their Subjects pickeer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one with another; their Affairs are not yet so well settled, as to bear the effects of
private Animosities; and if their Enemies may expect tenderness from the mildness of
their Reign, 'tis a little too preposterous to bring perhaps their best Friends immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into Trouble. You are now upon a noble project of uniting Protestants, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I hope you will not think that Anger is a convenient preparative to love, and that
the best expedient to make them Friends, is to divide them into factions.</p>
            <p>That this will be the probable consequence of so ungrateful a review of former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
seems very evident; for First, a great part of the Nation have not so terrible
an Idea of the matter in Question, and then to be severe upon Persons for a moot fault
will sound very harsh, especially when their late worthly behaviour had sufficiently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toned
for greater miscarriages; and Secondly, a great many considerable men of the
same, and other Corporations are in the same instances culpable; so that if you extend
your punishments only to these Gentlemen, and your pardon to the rest, yet you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
them too in the same Guilt, which to a generous mind is equally afflicting; and
tho you do not punish, yet you will be thought to insult, and expose them to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
of every insolent reflector.</p>
            <p>And therefore I hope for the safety of the Nation, for the sake of their Majesties, and
the interest of Religion, you will not countenance every angry Spirit, which by its
long continuance seems to be stiffned into Malice and Revenge; that your Glorious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
may not be frustrated by the remembrance of former Misunderstandings, which
I am afraid on all sides are easier forgot then justified; that we may henceforth avoid
the contrivance of the Jesuite, which is always active and working; for he who hath
not strength to conquer, may yet have the cunning to divide.</p>
