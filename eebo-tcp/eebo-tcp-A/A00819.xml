            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

he is able to releaſe them as he did here
<hi>Naman,</hi> if it ſhalbe good for them. The ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Aſſyrians as they ſcouted abroad
and placed with her: This maide ſéeing her
Lord and maſter his wofull eſtate, like an
honeſt ſeruant pitied it, and wiſhed that
her Lord were with the Prophet in her

The words of the maide were brought to

<hi>Eliſha</hi> hearing of this behauiour in the
king, ſent word to him to ſend <hi>Naman</hi> to
him, and he ſhould know that there was a

Prophet in Iſrael. Vpon which meſſage
<hi>Naman</hi> came to him, &amp; receiued this dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
that he ſhould go waſh ſeuen times in

was he from ioying to heare of health after
this ſort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he tooke it to be a méere mockery

looked the Prophet ſhould haue come forth

ſéeke a fit match for his maſters ſonne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
his owne kinred, from whom he
was then farre ſeperate by the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, that willed him to remooue as
he did, the ſeruaunt fell vpon his knées to
the Lord for direction, euerie way in that
buſineſſe to his maſters good: would not
eate nor drinke when he came to the place,
till he ſaw how he ſhould ſpéede, &amp;c. How

to day: Loue to maſter, is loue to
God, ſeruice to maſter is ſeruice to God, &amp;
ſo reputed, eſtéemed, and bleſſed of God.
Now if we ſhould aſke by what meanes
this loue was wrought in the ſeruants to
their maſter, certainly (with great proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie

vſeth outward things as he pleaſeth, and
