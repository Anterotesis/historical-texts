            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Courteous Reader:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BEfore the ſpace of five years, we have mutually communicated by written Papers ſomthing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Affect in privat meetings (which ſom of us Phyſitians uſe ſomtimes to have for Exerciſe-ſake in the works of Art) When theſ things had opened a way in ſome ſort to the deeper enquiry and ſearch after the condition and cure of this Diſeaſ; We thought it might prove a very ſuccesful undertaking to recal thoſe Papers once again to a Review; and (thoſe things being called out which might be beſt accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this uſe) to prepare a perfect Tractate of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſ. That Care by common ſuffrage was entruſted to D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Gliſſon,</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Bate,</hi> and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Regemorter,</hi> who purpoſed at firſt to divide this buſineſs among themſelvs according to the parts of the future Tractate, and to aſſign to each one his proper task. But when D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Gliſſon</hi> in the judgment of the reſt had accuratly interweaved his part (which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the finding out of the Eſſence of this Diſeaſ) and in that had propounded many things different from the common Opinion of Phyſitians (though perhaps the leſs different from the truth) we altered our Reſolution, and committed the firſt Stuff of the whol Work to be wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb facs="tcp:169706:3"/>
by him alone, leſt at length the parts ſhould ariſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, miſhapen and <hi>heterogeneous</hi> to themſelvs. He accepted the offer, but with this condition, that whilſt he was employed in beautifying and adorning this part, the other two ſhould often hold conſultation with him, and confer unto the Wouf their Covenanants of free commerce by their own obſervations concerning this Affect, and that thoſe things which ſhould be delineated and ſhaped by his labor and ſtudy, ſhould preſently undergo the examination and judgment of the reſt, as if they had been faſhioned by their hands. And ſo at the length we have brought this Work (ſuch as it is) to perfection, and have offered it to the publick view, being by no means moved therunto by an itch of writing (which is the Epidemical ill cuſtom of this age) but by this Conſideration only, That becauſ we are not born for our ſelvs, we might make theſe (ſuch as they are) common, which in ſom meaſure may advance the health of Infancy and tender age (in which for the preſent a great part of Mankind, but for the future all Mankind is comprehended) and likewiſe propagate an Encreaſ unto Learning: with this hope alſo, That by this Example we may invite the Wits of other moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men to make inquiſition into the Eſſences of Diſeaſes and their Cauſes, and to examin theſe our Labors that poſterity may enjoy them yet more perfect. But the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Eſſence of this Diſeaſ, and this our daring to tread in unbeaten paths (were we ſilent) might obtain a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and modeſtly chalenge a candid interpretation for all defects, lapſes, and errors in theſe our Endeavors. Finally, expect no flaſhes of Rhetorick and Courtly-Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;

               </note>Plica, and the like; in which number this very affect we are now about to handle may be juſtly Regiſtred. For if we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min al the diſeaſes of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants &amp; children deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed either by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents or Modern Writers in their Books of the Diſeaſes of Infants, we ſhall meet with none which with a ſufficient
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:169706:6"/>
exactneſs doth delineate the condition and Idea of this evil. For although it may ſeem to hold a correſpondence, or to have ſome affinity with a chronical Feaver, a Conſumption, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuation or leanneſſe of Infants, and the <note n="‡" rend="inter">A Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe in the head, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rhewm.</note>Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephalos; yet to ſpeak truth it is an affect evidently dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from them in the Species. For you may obſerve many to be vehemently affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with this Malady without any Feaveriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtemper, or any cauſe of ſuch ſuſpition: in like maner although a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption doth freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupervene upon this Diſeaſe before the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Patient, yet is it ſeldome ſeen to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the firſt invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, as for the meagerneſs or leanneſs, although ſome parts are perpetually obſerved in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:169706:6"/>
this affect to be made lean, yet this doth not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in all alike, as in a right and true leanneſs, but you may perceave the parts about the head and face to be in a thriving condition as to outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and well complexioned, even to the laſt day of life. Finally, The Hydrocephalus is very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently complicated with this affect, yet we have diſſected ſome whoſe Brain hath been ſufficiently firme, and not over-moiſtned with this ſuperfluous humour. Some have conjectured that this Diſeaſe is an imp or fruit of the French-pox or Scurvy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending from the viciated Bodies of the Parents upon the Children: For we deny not but the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, being infected with the Scurvy or the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Pox, may propagate and bring forth an Iſſue, not only affected with that Pox &amp; Scurvy, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe infected with this evil, and this even hath alſo faln under Obſervation: yet for the moſt part this Diſeaſe in the propriety of its Eſſence, hath neither affinity nor familiarity with thoſe affects, and beſides it requireth a different progreſs of cure; we have ſometimes likewiſe obſerved a ſtrumatical and ſwelling Malady to be complicated with this; but we have alſo many times beheld this to be well diſtinguiſhed from that, and that from this.</p>
            <p>But why do we dwel ſo long upon this inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? ſeing that he, who wil accurately contemplate the ſigns of this affect, as in their due places they ſhal be propounded, may moſt eaſily perſwade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, That this is abſolutly a new Diſeaſe, and never deſcribed by any of the Ancient or Modern Writers in their practical Books which are extant at this day, of the Diſeaſes of Infants.</p>
            <p>But this Diſeaſe became firſt known (as neer as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:169706:7"/>
we could gather from the Relation of others after a ſedulous enquiry) about thirty years ſince in the Counties of <hi>Dorſet</hi> and <hi>Somerſet,</hi> lying in the weſtern part of <hi>England;</hi> ſince which time the obſervation of it hath been derived unto other places, as <hi>London, Oxford, Cambridge,</hi> and almoſt all the Southern and Weſtern parts of the Kingdom: in the Nothern Counties this affect is very rarely ſeen, and ſcarcely yet made known among the Vulgar ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>The moſt receaved and ordinary Name of this Diſeaſe is, The RICKETS: But who baptiz'd it, and upon what occaſion, or for what reaſon, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by chance or advice it was ſo named, is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>However it obtained that Name, yet in ſo great a variety of places through which it hath ranged, it hath not to this day been known by any other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination.</p>
            <p>But it is an accident well worth our admiration, That this Diſeaſe being new, and not long ago nameleſs, at leaſt not known by this Name, neither ſpreading ſo much in remote as in adjacent places, yet no man hitherto could be found out, who knew, or could ſhew, either the firſt Author of the Name, or the Patient to whom the appellation of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe was firſt accommodated, or the peculier place where it was don, or the maner how it cam to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed among the common people: for the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants having gotten a Name for the Diſeaſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave it with acquieſcence as a thing done with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and deliberation, and are not at all further ſolicitous either about the Name, or the Author of the Name.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:169706:7"/>
But becauſe they which are expert in the Greek &amp; Latin tongues, may peradventure expect a Name from us, wherof ſome kind of Reaſon maybe given, we have made fit together divers Names to this Diſeaſe, yet we conceave it ſomewhat unneceſſary to make a particular rehearſal of them in this place: Nevertheleſs it may perhaps be proper and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to commemorate the Rules which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to our ſelves in the deſignation of the Name: The Firſt therefore was, That the Name ſhould comprehend ſome notable condition of the Diſeaſe. The Second was, That it ſhould be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently diſtinct from the Names of other Diſeaſes and Symptoms. The Third was, That it ſhould be ſufficiently familiar, eaſie of pronounciation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modated to the Memory, of no undecent length, and not ſtudiouſly, and laboriouſly compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>Whileſt we bend our employments to the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of theſe Rules, One of us by chance fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Name which was complacenceous to himſelf, and afterwards pleaſing to the reſt; now this was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. or indeed <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> (for that termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is not altogether abhorrent from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Gender) the Spinal Diſeaſe, alſo <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the diſeaſe of the Spine of the Back: For the Spine of the Back, is the firſt and principal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the parts affected in this evil. Then no other Malady or Symptom did by the prerogative of time vindicate this appellation from it; beſides the Name is familiar and eaſie. And finally, The Engliſh Name <hi>Rickets,</hi> receaved with ſo great a conſent of the people, doth by this Name ſeem to be excuſed, yea, juſtified from Barbariſm. For without any
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:169706:8"/>
wracking or convulſion of the word, the name <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> may be readily deduced from the Greek word <hi>Rachitis,</hi> or <hi>Rachites;</hi> provided, That we will but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that conſideration of change, which in vulgar pronounciation uſually happeneth to words tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplanted from one Language to another.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>You will ſay, That they which impoſed firſt the Engliſh name</hi> Rickets, <hi>were peradventure altogether unskilful in, and ignorant of the Greek tongue, or that they never thought of the Greek word</hi> Rachites, <hi>at leaſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not that the Spine of the Back was the principal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe parts which were firſt affected in this Diſeaſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> We Anſwer, It concerns not us whether they were ignorant of, or thought not upon the Greek word, or whether they did not underſtand the principal part that was firſt affected; yet are theſ things freely aſſerted. For we knew many at that time when the Diſeaſe did firſt ſpring up, and the Name was impoſed, indeed learned men and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the Greek tongue, to have their Reſidence in thoſe places, to whom it was not perhaps any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to obſerve that conſpicuous debility of the Spine in this affect, and thereupon they might aſſign this Name unto it; although tis very poſſible, yea probable, That the common people by the error of pronounciation might ſomewhat pervert the Name ſo given, and expreſſe it, as to this day they retain it by the word <hi>Rickets.</hi> But whether it were, or were not ſo, we are not at al ſolicitous. If the matter were ſo, the impoſed Name will (as is manifeſt) be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether congruous, and perhaps alſo at the laſt will moſt fitly correſpond with it. For ſuppoſe you
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:169706:8"/>
ſhould fall upon ſome Name, received not ſo much by choice as chance, yet ſo fit, that a more comodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Name could ſcarce be deviſed by councel and deliberation, nor one more conſonant to Reaſon; in ſuch a Caſe, What would you do? Would you extirpate and baniſh the receaved word, to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce one that was new and nothing better? This practice would uſurp upon the priviledge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and be injurous to the cuſtome of Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Words contract a value by their uſe, and ought not to be denizen'd with raſhneſs, or innovated by timerity: Or would you not rather confirm the Name receaved, yet as a new one, and from that time to be deduced from a new Origine: for this would be at the leaſt like a choſen Science in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculated upon a new ſtock, which by reaſon of the affinity with the Root, would without any difficulty receave ſtrength and nouriſhment: Or if this pleaſe you not, ſuppoſe if you pleaſe, That we now newly deviſed the Engliſh name of this Diſeaſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it from the Greek word <hi>Rachites:</hi> the Engliſh word reſulting from hence would be the <hi>Rachites:</hi> and how little is the difference between that and the ordinary word <hi>Rickets?</hi> Certainly ſo little, That the vulgar pronounciation is not wont to be greatly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous about ſo ſmal a difference: But we trifle too much in ſtaying ſo long upon theſe trifles. Let the Greek Name therfore of the Diſeaſe be <hi>nóſos Rachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> or <hi>Rachites</hi> (if the word may be allowed to be of the common Gender) or <hi>tes Rácheos;</hi> in Latin <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Spinali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <head>CHAP. II. Anotomical Obſervations collected from the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection and Inſpection of Bodies ſubdued and killed by this Diſeaſe.</head>
            <p>BEfore we attempt an enquiry into the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Cauſes of this Diſeaſe, we hold it convenient to premiſe ſome few certain and undoubted things, as being obvious to the Senſes, which both demonſtrate the real exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of this Diſeaſe, and may alſo be caſt for a foundation, whereon to build the Superſtructure of our judgment &amp; opinion concerning this new Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. For we would not have any man to imagine that we here treat of ſome Fictitious &amp; Imaginary Evil, much leſs to expect that our Opinion ſhould be credulouſly embraced without examination. But this we rather aim at, That the matter of our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to all poſſibility may be known and precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the very entrance, that we may confirm thoſe things which we ſhall propoſe, by thoſe things that are obvious to the Senſes, as occaſion ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; and that the Reader being inſtructed in theſe, may become a competent judge of our Reaſons, and with the more facility be able to interpoſe his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning each of them. We atteſt therfore
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:169706:9"/>
that many of us have been preſent at ſeveral Diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Bodies which have been ſeparated by this Diſeaſe, and that we will in this Chapter briefly and faithfully declare thoſe things which we have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto Obſerved by long experience and frequent Diſſections, namely, Thoſe things which we have ſeen with our eyes, and have handled with our hands.</p>
            <p>In the mean time Two things are here to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed: The former is, That the Reader carry in his memory, That the dead Bodies which we o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened were moſt vehemently afflicted with this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe whileſt they were animated, for they are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for the moſt part to have yeelded to the very magnitude of the Diſeaſe, and therefore he muſt not expect that magnitude of the Affect or Symptoms which we here deſcribe, in other Bodies yet living or newly beſieged. For every Diſeaſe is moved to a Conſiſtence, and then alſo Nature being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and unable to maintain the conflict groweth worſe and worſe. The latter is that the Reader take notice, That almoſt all Diſeaſes in proceſſe of time, do unite unto themſelves other affects of a different kind, and therefore that chronical Diſeaſes are for the moſt part complicated before death: Let him not therfore imagine that every preternatural thing that is found in dead Bodies, though deſtroyed by this affect, muſt of neceſſity belong to this evil; for perhaps it may rather have reference to ſome other Diſea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e ſupervenient upon this before death, then to this very Malady: And the truth is, Anatomiſts through inadvertency, and want of due regard to this Caution, have fouly ered in their Obſervations, whileſt they aſcribe thoſe things which concern a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:169706:10"/>
Diſeaſe, to another wherewith it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated before the diſſolution. The beſt preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therefore or rectification of this error is, Not to make a raſh judgment from the inſpection of one or two bodies, but firſt by a reiterated and ſedulous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, to be able to diſtinguiſh what things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually occur, what for the moſt part, what fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and what but ſeldome, in the diſſected bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that have periſhed of the ſame Diſeaſe: for you muſt know, That whatſoever is not perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſpicuous in the opened Bodies diſſolved by the ſame Diſeaſe, cannot appertain to the intimate and chief Eſſence of it: for neither the Diſeaſe it ſelf can have an exiſtence being ſeparated from its Eſſence, nor the Eſſence being ſeparated from the Diſeaſe. But enough of theſe things; let us now proceed to the Obſervations themſelves.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III. Certain Suppoſitions are propoſed for the eaſier finding out of the Eſſence of the Diſeaſe. Firſt of the Eſſence of Health. Secondly of the Eſſence of a Diſeaſe. Thirdly of a threefold Diviſion of Health and Diſeaſes. The Explication of the third Diviſion, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of the ſame. The Deſcription of a natural Conſtitution, and the exaltation of it. The Fourth Suppoſition of the Combination of three Conſtitutions in the ſame parts.</head>
            <p>THat we may proceed the more diſtinctly and clearly in the finding out of the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe of this Diſeaſe, we judged it very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to premiſe theſe ſubſequent Suppoſitions:</p>
            <p>I <hi>That the Eſſence of Health doth conſiſt in ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Body according to Nature.</hi> But ſeing this is twofold in the kind, one <hi>Eſſential</hi> and neceſſary, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the <hi>tò eſſe</hi> ſimply, which during life conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth immoveable and immutable under various affections, and is indiviſible: The other <hi>Accidental,</hi> having reference to the <hi>tò bene eſſe,</hi> which in reſpect of the whole Animal, is both moveable and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:169706:14"/>
and hath a great latitude, and can be preſent or abſent without the diſſolution of the whole. Health conſiſts not in the former, but in the latter Conſtitution.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>That the Eſſence of a Diſeaſe in like manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth not in the Eſſential Conſtitution:</hi> For ſo the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the whole would by and by follow: But in the <hi>Accidental</hi> Conſtitution, namely ſuch an one, as in reſpect of the whole can be preſent or abſent without its diſſolution. We have ſaid (and not without reaſon) that this Conſtitution wherein Health and Sickneſſe are founded, is moveable and accidental in reſpect of the whole; for even this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in reſpect of ſome part may be eſſential: as for example, a finger being cut off, a Diſeaſe ariſeth in the defective number of the parts, which in reſpect of the whole, is founded upon an accidental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; for that finger may be preſent or abſent without the diſſolution of the whole; but in reſpect of the loſt member it is founded upon an Eſſential Conſtitution, for this Diſeaſe being ſuppoſed, the Eſſence of that finger periſheth.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>That the Conſtitution wherein the Eſſence both of Health and Sickneſs conſiſteth, admits a threefold man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of diviſion or diſtinction in the method of Diſcipline.</hi> The firſt is ſomewhat thick, and is reſolved into parts altogether Concrete, namely, It proceedeth <hi>Kata topous,</hi> according to the diviſion of the parts from head to heel. The ſecond is purely abſtracted, and ſearcheth out all the Elements of the moveable Conſtitution, from whence cometh the diviſion of Diſeaſes into ſimilar, organical, and common; and then again thoſe various ſubdiviſions into diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, faults of figure, ſuperficies, cavities and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:169706:14"/>
of magnitude, number, ſite and continuity. The third is as it were a middle manner, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it hath been hitherto neglected, yet we dare avouch, That it may have its uſe, and that no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible one, in the handling of Diſeaſes, and the finding out of the cauſes of the Diſeaſe; and it is divided into a Conſtitution Natural, Vital, and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt is proper to, and inherent in every part, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely competible to it, and without any dependance upon the other parts according to the Eſſence of it ſimply:</hi> This remaineth a while after death, till it be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Putrefaction, Ambuſtion, ſimple Exiccati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Mummification, Petrification, and the like vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Cauſes. This Conſtitution in reſpect of its ſimple Eſſence, doth not depend upon thoſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers which miniſter an Influx, but it dependeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them both in reſpect of its Conſervation, and likewiſe of its Operation. For the vital influx cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing after death (which is as it were the ſalt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment of it) quickly periſheth, and as long as the creature liveth, this is variouſly affected by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxes, and thereupon the actions are either promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or interupted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Second is the Vital Conſtitution, which is produced by that continual influx from the heart thorow the arteries into the parts of the whole Body.</hi> This alſo it admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth degrees, and is often ſubject to variations more or leſſe, and ſometimes alſo ſeemeth to ſuffer a kind of eclips, as in a ſwouning, a ſyncope, &amp;c. yet it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevereth from the beginning to the laſt period of life (at leaſt in its fountain, and in ſome other parts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Third is the Animal Conſtitution, which is derived</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:169706:15"/>
               <hi>from the Brain thorow the Nerves into the Organs of Senſe and Motion.</hi> This is many times totally wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in many parts, the life notwithſtanding remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yea it might for a long time together be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in ſeveral parts, or all the parts, did not reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which is abſolute neceſſary unto life, depend upon it. Theſe Conſtitutions therefore keep ſuch a connexion between themſelves, that the ſecond doth eternally and continually preſuppoſe the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of the former, and the third of the ſecond; but there is not back again ſo abſolute a dependance between them, becauſe (as we have even now ſaid) the former can for ſome time ſubſiſt without the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and the ſecond commonly altogether without the third: And theſe three Conſtitutions may in moſt bodies be manifeſtly perceived, yet we affirm not that they may be found in all. The Natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed and the Vital are wanting to no part: but the Animal is defective in the Bones (though the teeth will admit ſome doubt) griſtles, perhaps ligaments, and ſome ſubſtances as of the Liver, Spleen, &amp;c. we aſſert therefore this threefold Conſtitution to be in all thoſe parts, to whom the Natural, Vital, and Animal Faculty is communicated. For although theſe Faculties as to the firſt act may be ſaid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Soul (which relation hath indeed no relation to the Medicinal art) yet in reſpect of the ſecond act they are neceſſarily rooted in ſome mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Conſtitution of the parts to which they belong. For whereas ſome ſay that the Vital Faculty is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Heart, and the Animal from the Brain unto the other parts, that muſt not ſo be underſtood, as if the Faculties themſelves in a wandring manner were tranſient from part to part (for the paſſing of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:169706:15"/>
an accident from ſubject to ſubject cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by any underſtanding) but that the Vital Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is derived with, and in the vital Spirit from the Heart unto the parts, or at leaſt is excited by ſome motion of the Heart and Arteries in the parts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and in like manner the Animal Faculty doth deſcend in and with the Animal Spirit by the Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, or is produced in the parts by ſome motion of the Nerves in the Brain. Which way ſoever it comes to paſſe, we muſt needs confeſſe that ſome alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is imprinted in the part it ſelf receiving it either from the ſaid Spirits, or from their motions. Which alteration as it is here granted to be the root of the Faculty, either Vital, or Animal in the reſpective parts, ſo is it a moveable Conſtitution, becauſe it can be variouſly changed, remitted, and intended without the diſſolution of the whole; and it is the Conſtitution wherein either Health or Sickneſſe may conſiſt, ſeeing that whenſoever alteration is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient unto the parts wherein it ought to be, or any other wayes adminiſtred then is requiſite, the action will thereupon be unavoidably depraved; but if it be rightly performed, then ſound and perfect health is ſaid to be preſent from the part of that Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Conſidering therefore that there are two kind of Alterations beſides the natural and inherent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, one from the influx of the Heart, another from the influx of the Brain in moſt parts; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſaid alterations, as they themſelves are more perfect or more imperfect, do render the Faculties in the reſpective parts (at leaſt as to the ſecond act) more perfect or imperfect, and that the actions are thereupon depraved or ſound, it is neceſſary that this threefold Conſtitution reſide in moſt of the parts,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:169706:16"/>
and that the ſaid kind of alterations be medical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions whereon Health and Sickneſſe may be grounded.</p>
            <p>That this Diviſion or Diſtinction is not frivolous or altogether unprofitable, appeareth from hence, becauſe the practical Phyſitians in their Methods do rightly admoniſh, that in obſcure Diſeaſes the Faculties muſt be accurately obſerved, when their actions are ſeen to be depraved, which diligence may ſerve as it were for a Manuduction to guide us to the Origine of the affect; now if it be a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ſo juſt importance to note the interupted Faculties in Diſeaſes, certainly it will be an exerciſe of no leſſe moment to take cognizance of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions themſelves, upon which thoſe Faculties have an immediate and ſtrict dependance.</p>
            <p>Now leaſt any man ſhould conceive that there is almoſt a coincidence between this third Diviſion and the ſecond, he may obſerve, if he will diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weigh the matter, That every member of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion doth in ſome manner include al the members of the next precedent, namely that the natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution doth comprehend primarily indeed the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar Conſtitution, but that ſecondarily and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the whole creature, it containeth in a ſort the conformation and continuity; in like manner that the Vital and Animal Conſtitution do in their way ſo clearly participate of all the Members of the ſaid Diviſion, that to offer proofs of it were an unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary undertaking: Only we deſire the Reader to take notice (which alſo we even now intimated) That the natural Conſtitution primarily and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally hath reſpect unto the temperament, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon qualities, the plenty of the Spirits, and the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:169706:16"/>
diſpoſition of them (which by ſome are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the form and the whole ſubſtance) but that it hath reſpect unto the manner of the Organe and the continuity as it were ſecondarily, and in order to the whole creature, and that it can ſcarce be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hurt or vitiated by them. Yet we muſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but that the natural Conſtitution is ſometimes vitiated as it is meerly Organical, for thus it falleth out in the obſtructions of the natural paſſages; as for example, when a ſtone is impacted or grown to hardneſſe in the paſſage of the Meter or the yard, and in the like caſes: but this happeneth unto it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in as much as the paſſage is ordained for the uſe and conſervation of the whole; but for the moſt part the Organical vices in the natural Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution are of leſſe note and conſideration then the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar.</p>
            <p>Theſe things may ſuffice to be ſpoken in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral way of this triple Conſtitution. We will now in particular ſpeak a few things of them in few words.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Natural Conſtitution</hi> which is proper unto and inherent in every part, may be known by this diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, That it is the manner of the natural Being, ſetled in the parts, competible to them, in as much as they are aptly conſtituted by their temperament, and common quallities, by their ſufficient portion and convenient diſpoſition of ingenerated Spirits, and by their juſt conformation and continuity, to a perfect performance of natural actions, together with the concurrence of the Vital (and perhaps the Animal) influx. Therefore when there is in any part a juſt temperament, convenient common qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, an exquiſite proportion, and harmonious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:169706:17"/>
of inherent Spirits. Finally, when there is a laudable conformation and unity, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, the natural action is depraved, we may well conclude that it is not vitiated by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conſtitution, but by reaſon of the concurrent cauſe, namely the vital or natural influx, or of both together; for the natural actions in creatures in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the union and wedlock of life, are exalted to a more eminent condition then otherwiſ they would attain unto by the natural Conſtitution alone. And from hence it comes to paſſe, That although the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conſtitution in ſlain Creatures remaineth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death undepraved for a while, yet the attractive and retentive Faculty, the concoction of the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the expulſion of the exctement do alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ceaſe: And in Diſeaſes alſo many times the natural Conſtitution is at firſt untoucht, yet the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural action is vitiated meerly by the defect of the due concurrence of the vital influx: after the ſame manner ſomttimes the natural and vital Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being ſound and healthful, yet ſome natural acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is depraved by reaſon of the defect of ſome ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal influx and concurence: but this for the moſt part happeneth only in the Nervous, Fibrous, and Membranous parts, eſpecially where they make a hollowneſſe, but ſeldom or not at all in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the parts: As in the Palſy the excrements are many times unduly retained, by reaſon only of the aſtoniſhment and inſenſiblneſſe of the guts, the other conſtitutions being ſound. Therefore in theſe caſes, when ſome natural action is hurt, we muſt not preſently conclude that the natural Conſtitution is firſt vitiated, but we muſt with dilligence enquire out that Conſtitution which is firſt vitiated, for that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:169706:17"/>
is to be looked upon as the root and firſt eſſence of the evil; in like manner if ſome vital action be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, we muſt not preſently infer that the vital Conſtitution is primarily vitiated; becauſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the firſt Origin is more rightly deduced from the natural, or perhaps the animal Conſtitution: as for example, Through the intenſiveneſſe of cold, a finger is mortified by inflamation: in this caſe it is true that the influx of the vital bloud is plainly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; yet the beginning of that interception muſt be ſought out in the natural Conſtitution of that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part ſo benumned: So alſo in a Convulſion the circulation of the bloud is perhaps ſomething di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed and interupted; but the firſt depravation muſt be aſcribed to the animal, not to the vital Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. On the contrary, in a Feaver the Head is invaded, but the ſource of the evil will peradventure be found out in the vital Conſtitution: ſo perhaps the Fleſh is waſted, and al the natural Spirits are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed; yet the root of the evil wil be found out in the vital, not in the natural Conſtitution: So that any Conſtitution of the three before named may be in ſeveral Diſeaſes, ſometimes the firſt, ſometimes the ſecond, and ſometimes the third cauſe of vitiated actions.</p>
            <p>Not only many other parts of the body (yea ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply al the ſenſible) which exhibit not an influx, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are ſubſervient as delatory parts, do naturally admit this threefold Conſtitution, but beſides alſo even the Heart it ſelf, and all the arteries, and the Brain and al the nerves, ſo that the Brain (excepting the fault in its natural Conſtitution) may be cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and helped by the vital Spirit which is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted thorow the veins and the arteries, being wel
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:169706:18"/>
affected, or vitiated and hurt if that be ill affected: And after the ſame manner alſo may the Heart by the animal Spirit which hath an influx thorow the recurent nerve of the ſixth pair, the arteries alſo by the animal influx thorow the nerves by a way per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not yet found out: And Finally, The Nerves alſo by the vital Spirit deduced thorow the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IV. That the Eſſence of this Diſeaſe conſiſts not in the Animal or Vital, but in the Natural Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; not as Organical, but as Similar: <hi>Three Limitations are Propounded.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe things being Preſuppoſed, We ſhal proceed to enquir in what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the parts the firſt Root or Eſſence of this affect is lodged. Be the firſt Concluſion therefore this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Firſt Root of this Affect is not in the Animal Conſtitution, or in that which dependeth upon the Influx of the Brain into the parts.</hi> Indeed we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that al the nerves which without the Skul pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the ſpinal marrow, are found to be looſe and weak in this affect; yet this doth not here ſeem to ariſe from a defect of the influx of the Brain, which we thus prove, Firſt the looſneſſe and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:169706:18"/>
of the nerves, which cometh primarily from the Brain, is almoſt alwayes conſociated with ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolency and drowſineſſe; but this Symptom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth but rarely, and by accident only in this affect. Secondly, As we remember, we never knew the Palſy, or the Apoplexy to ſupervene or follow upon this Diſeaſe; but it ought neceſſarily ſo to do, and that very often (at leaſt in the confirmation of the Diſeaſe) if this looſneſſe and weakneſs of the nerves ſhould take beginning from a defect of the influx of the Brain. Thirdly, We have obſerved the Brain to be ſufficiently firm and inculpable in many diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted after death. Fourthly, For the moſt part thoſe that are afflicted with this evil are ingenious in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their age, which doth evidently atteſt the vigour and vivacity of the Brain.</p>
            <p>The Second Concluſion. <hi>The firſt root of this affect is not in the Vital Conſtitution, or in that which dependeth upon the Influx of the Heart into the parts.</hi> An unequal diſtribution of bloud indeed almoſt (if not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) perpetual may be obſerved in this affect: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe the chief reaſon of this inequality muſt be aſcribed, not to the inequaſity of the influx of the Heart or Arteries, but to the unequal reception and unaptneſſe in the parts themſelves to receive it; for the Heart and the Arteries do for their part indiſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately or equally diſtribute the bloud with the Spirits every way into the parts. But if it ſo fal out that an Artery of ſome part be interupted in his fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by reaſon of the benumnedneſſe and ſtupefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of that part, or the parts adjacent, there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity that the bloud muſt be minutely tranſmitted thither, and ſo unequally in reſpect of the other parts which expeditely and aptly receave the bloud.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:169706:19"/>
Therefore in this caſe this inequality of diſtribution doth properly and primarily depend upon a preexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent fault without the artery pertaining to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conſtitution of the parts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome may Object, <hi>Although perhaps the aforeſaid inequality hath no dependance upon the Heart, yet it may ſo happen that a weak Pulſe may ſuffice to diſtribute the bloud thorow the leſſer Circulations in the inner parts, which nevertheleſs may not be altogether ſo ſufficient to undergo that duty thorow the greater Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the outward parts which are more remote from the Heart, the fountain of bloud.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We Anſwer, That this Objection was formerly of ſo great importance with one of us, that he ſuppoſed ſuch an inequality of the vital influx did belong to the prime Eſſence of this Diſeaſe, and did therefore endeavour to deduce the reaſon of the firſt Symptoms from it. But after ſecond thoughts, the matter being more neerly and deeply examined, he was of Opinion, That this inequality of the vital in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux had no relation to the primary, but to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary Eſſence of the Diſeaſe. But we return to the ſolution of the Argument. And Firſt we grant indeed that in this affect there is an unequal diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the bloud; and that in the internal parts and in the head it is more liberal, in the external more ſparing. Secondly we grant that the Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the bloud may be kept in the inward parts, even although no Pulſe apear in the outward parts; but this happeneth only in a vehement either weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or oppreſſion of the vital Spirits, as in a ſwoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a ſtrong hyſterical paroxiſm, or fit of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:169706:19"/>
Mother, in which affect ſome that have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for dead have been ſeen to revive again. Thirdly we grant that a more liberal Circulation of the bloud may be in the internal then the external parts, yea and in ſome one external part more then in another, as it happeneth in the inflamation of ſome external member.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being granted, we affirm, that in the <hi>firſt Caſe</hi> the inequality of the diſtribution of the bloud doth not principally depend upon the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Pulſifical vertue for as much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the heart; and the reaſon hereof is plain. For the heart, as we have already ſaid, doth emit the bloud indiſcriminatly or equally, and with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation from it ſelf into the Aorta or chief artery, even at ſuch time when as the Pulſe is moſt weak. This artery doth exonerate or disburthen it ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with al poſſible expedition, and from hence proceedeth the inequality of the diffuſion of the bloud, as the bloud is more eaſily impelled from on rivelet then from another. This inequality not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding muſt not properly and primarily be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the heart, but to the recipient parts, and to the particular tranſmitting arteries. For any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary affect of the heart is neceſſarily univerſal, and communicated to al the parts of the body: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although we grant this enequality of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the bloud to be in the ſecondary Eſſence of this Diſeaſe, yet we exclude it from the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary.</p>
            <p>Moreover in the <hi>Second Caſe</hi> propounded, we ſay that there is a great diſparity between the caſes of extream neceſſity, and ordinary caſes. Neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed do we know whether in the ſaid caſes the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:169706:20"/>
in the inward parts, howſoever it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, be of any moment. And for ſo much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the preſent buſineſſe, we deny any ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the heart in this affect, that the Pulſe ſhould be defective in the outward parts; yea we have not obſerved that any one afflicted with this Diſeaſe hath been prone to fal into an extacy, or a ſwoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which would readily happen if the origin of the Diſeaſe were rooted in the debility of the heart it ſelf. Beſides when we have ſeen ſuch as were ſick in their tender age, to endure without any loſs of ſtrength ſometimes a liberal eduction or flowing forth of the bloud from the opened veins of their ears, yea and ſeen it ſometimes reiterated with good ſucceſſe. Finally, When alſo they have very wel endured purgations, with reſpect had to their age, it doth not appear to us how the firſt root of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil can be aſcribed to the weakneſs of the vital con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Third Caſe</hi> it is evidently manifeſt that the firſt cauſe of this unequal circulation of the bloud is ſome diſpoſition of an outward part, as in an infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med member, laboring under ſome private Diſeaſe, there happeneth a more ful and impetuous Pulſe by reaſon of the accidental heat of the artery, infuſed by the immoderation of heat which is in that outward part.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſeing that the Eſſence of this affect cannot be primarily rooted in the animal nor the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Conſtitution of the parts (as we have now ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) it followeth (which ſhal be the Third Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) <hi>That the primary Eſſence, or firſt root of this affect, conſiſteth in the proper or inherent conſtitution of the parts.</hi> But becauſe the natural Conſtitution (as we have
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:169706:20"/>
ſaid above) conſiſteth partly in the common quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and the temperament, and partly in a juſt plenty and diſpoſition of the inherent Spirits, and again partly in the organical conſtruction and continuity; our next enquiry muſt be to find out in which of the prementioned conſtitutions it lodgeth, and whether it be rooted in one alone, or in many, or in altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Be the Fourth Concluſion therefore this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This affect is not radicated in the Organical Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the parts.</hi> For although in progreſſe of time the Organs themſelves are divers wayes affected in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their conformation, quantity, and ſite, as it is ſufficiently manifeſt from the encreaſed bulk of the head, liver, &amp;c. from the tumours of the bones unto the wreſts, the ankls and the extremities of the ribs; from various obſtructions and the extenuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the outward parts; ſeing nevertheleſſe that al theſe things depend upon a higher origin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever alſo we may neceſſarily admit theſe things in a Diſeaſe confirmed, and now variouſly compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; yet in the original Eſſence, we preſume, for the ſubſequent reaſons they are to be rejected.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe the depravations aforeſaid in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical parts do not appear preſently in the beginning of the Diſeaſe, but encreaſe afterwards by little and little:</hi> And although perhaps ſome of theſe may be ſaid from the beginning to have taken root in the body, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they cannot as yet be immediatly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned by the ſenſe, neither do they manifeſtly hurt any actions, and for that reaſon they cannot apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the firſt Eſſence of the Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Becauſe the Organical vices aforeſaid are not the Cauſes but the Effects rather of the chief Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms which from the beginning exhibit themſelves in this</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:169706:21"/>
               <hi>affect.</hi> For the augmented figure of the head, liver, &amp;c. the ſtanding out of the bones, and the leanneſſe of the external parts, are more rightly refered to the inequality of the nouriſhment, then on the contrary the inequality of the nouriſhment ſhould be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to them: For when one part doth exceſſively encreaſe, and another is defrauded of a due &amp; decent augmentation, there is a neceſſity that a diſproporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate and an unequal nouriſhment muſt not only be preſent in the parts, but alſo have had a preexiſtence in the body, whereby one part is nouriſhed, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother neglected beneath a mediocrity. But ſeeing this unequal nouriſhment is a depraved action, and ſo a Symptom preſuppoſing ſome preexiſtent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and yet withal (as we have ſaid) doth precede, as a cauſe, the organical vices aforeſaid, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that thoſe organical vices are not the firſt root of this Diſeaſe. As for the obſtructions which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are for the moſt part conjoyned with this affect, yet nevertheleſſe there is a great deal of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to exclude them from the firſt Eſſence of this Diſeaſe, becauſe they neither ſpecificate the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, neither can any reaſon of the Symptoms be rendered from them, neither do they perpetually beſiege ſome certain and determinate noble part. Some man perhaps, who hath reſpect to the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive magnitude of the liver, may object that in this affect that is perpetually obſtructed, and thereupon the ſanguification being vitiated the other things are prepoſteriouſly derived; but if this ſwelling of the Liver did alwayes proceed from the obſtruction of it, then a paleneſſe of complexion, a cachexia or indigeſtion, and by the advantage of time, the Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie it ſelf ſhould neceſſarily and perpetually accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:169706:21"/>
this affect: Moreover, The Liver ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be ſeen to be vitiated in the colour, and at the diſſection hard tumors and knots ſhould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the ſubſtance of it, eſpecially in an invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate affect, and that which killed the Patient; but ſeing theſe things do not frequently (much leſſe perpetually) occur in dead bodies, the augmented bulk of it muſt rather be refered to the irregular nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition: Moreover, we deny it not but that we have obſerved by Anatomy in thoſe who have periſhed of this Diſeaſe, obſtructions, various tumours, and knotty excreſcencies in the Lungs, but we atteſt withal, That we have ſeen ſome Infants, yea Boys lightly affected with this evil, in whom there was no ſuſpicion of vitiated Lungs, for there was no cough, no impediment of reſpiration, which neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily is an individual companion of the obſtruction of the Lungs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Becauſe a ſufficient reaſon of all the Symptoms proper to this Diſeaſe, may more cleerly and eaſily be derived from other fountains, as we ſhal ſee anon.</p>
            <p>And thus we have ſufficiently proved, That this affect in reſpect of the firſt Eſſence of it, conſiſts not in the Organical Conſtitution of the natural parts. The ſame arguments wil more effectually convince (more might be produced, but we judge accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations unneceſſary) That this evil is not radicated in the continuity of the natural parts, ſo that there needs no more words to prove it.</p>
            <p>The Fifth Concluſion. <hi>This Diſeaſe is primarily rooted in the ſimilary Conſtitution of the natural parts:</hi> And therefore in reſpect of the radical Eſſence ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it is a ſimilary Diſeaſe. And becauſe a ſimilary
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:169706:22"/>
Diſeaſe, as ſuch, is not perpetually Simple, but ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times variouſly compounded (namely a Diſtemper is either Simple, or Compound, and this becomes ſuch, not only by the firſt qualities among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but perhaps by hidden qualities conjoyned together; or, which is more agreeable to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, eſpecially in the preſent buſineſs, by a kind of ſure proportion and medification of the inherent Spirits) We judg this to be a Compound Diſeaſe, and we aſſert the <hi>prime</hi> and <hi>radical</hi> Eſſence thereof to conſiſt in a cold and moiſt Diſtemper, with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and <hi>ſtupefaction</hi> of the inherent Spirits, concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the inherent conſtitution of the parts prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily affected. But before we proceed to an higher Explication of this Opinion, we wil premiſe ſome Limitations of it.</p>
            <p>The Firſt ſhal be this: <hi>That in this Diſeaſe, ſome parts of the Body are Primarily, and others Secondarily affected:</hi> And truly, to us the External parts ſeem ſooner to be affected than the Brain and Bowels, as we ſhall declare more at large when we come to ſpeak of the parts affected.</p>
            <p>The Second is this: <hi>That in thoſe parts alone which are Primarily affected, do labor under a notable cold Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper with penury and ſtupefaction of ſpirits:</hi> For the Brain perhaps and the Bowels may be moderatly hot, and ſufficiently abound with Spirits, by reaſon of the copious vital influx; and moiſture may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in them by reaſon of the affuſion of our over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plentiful aliment: but the other External parts are alwaies affected with a cold and moiſt Diſtemper, and a benumedneſs of the natural Spirit, &amp;c. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we aſſert, that in this Diſeaſe they are prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily affected, and that they alone are the ſeat of the firſt Eſſence of this Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:169706:22"/>
Be this the Third: <hi>All the External parts, and thoſe firſt affected, do not equally labor under a cold and moiſt Diſtemper, and with benumedneſs of Spirits,</hi> &amp;c. For the Ligaments, Tendons, and Nerves, are in their own nature more cold, and leſs moiſt; the Muſcles, or fleſhy parts are rather more moiſt, and leſs cold: the skinny parts uſually retain a mediocrity, yet al the ſaid parts recede more or leſs from the natural towards a cold and moiſt temper. And in like manner, although ſome of the ſaid parts do require a greater plenty and activity of Spirits than others, yet al of them a juſt proportion, being obſerved to the plenty and activity reſpectively due to each of them, are defective and deſtitute of that juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</p>

            <head>CHAP. V. The prepoſed Opinion is examined by Parts. Firſt, That this Diſeaſe is a cold Diſtemper. An Objection, and the Anſwer thereunto; That it is moiſt: That it conſiſteth in the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury or paucity of the Spirits. An Objection, with the Anſwer. Finally, That this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe conſiſteth in the ſtupefaction of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow let us more neerly examin the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion propoſed, and aſſert it by parts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the parts firſt affected do labor under a cold diſtemper may be proved. Firſt, from the unequal and diminiſhed nutrition of the ſaid parts; for as the inborn heat when it is augmented to a juſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth very much conduce to further the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of the Aliment; ſo if it be too remiſs, it ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily retardeth and leſſeneth the ſame.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſame diſtemper is proved from the ſlowneſs and unaptneſs to motion; and alſo from the averſation to exerciſe, and deſire to reſt. For as the activity and agility of the Body is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Heat, ſo the tardity and ſlothfulneſs of it is in great part aſcribed to Cold, Namely, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing (as before) that this ſlothfulneſs hath no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:169706:23"/>
upon the fault of the animal influx.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is further confirmed, becauſe this Diſeaſe many times followeth other accute Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, whereby they end not ſeldom (after the Waſt or Conſumption of the Natural heat) in a cold di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.</p>
            <p>Beſides, It alſo receiveth Chronical Diſeaſes which extenuate the Body, and ſuch as in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner are prone to leave a cold diſtemper behind them as Pertinacious Obſtructions, the Scurvy, Cachexy &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Becauſe it ſucceedeth the importune ſuppreſſion of Scabbedneſs, and Impetiginous ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, as we have often obſerved, when the Scabs have newly broken out again, and the Itch is revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ſuch Boyes have been eaſily reſtored to health, becauſe by that means the Natural heat is reaugmented in the outward Members.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Becauſe many times it happeneth after a continual uſe of cold, thick, and viſcous aliment, after ſurfeting and idleneſs, and the like evident cauſes, either diminiſhing or overwhelming the Natural heat.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It is yet more plainly evinced, becauſe thoſe helps which excite, augment, and cheriſh the heat in the outward parts, as various agitations, rubbings, and anointing of the Body, do contribute a large ſhare to the advancement of this Cure. Theſe things being all caſt together into a heap, it is ſufficiently conſpicuous that a cold diſtemper of the Natural conſtitution of the parts firſt affected is contained in the primary eſſence of this Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But here we meet with a ſpecious Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>That a little Feaver, eſpecially a ſlow one, or ſuch
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:169706:24"/>
as is erratical and wandering, is frequently conjoyned with this affect, which at the ſame time ſeemeth abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inconſiſtent with a cool diſtemper. For all Feavers by all men are accounted to be a hot diſtemper which is diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically oppoſite to the ſaid eſſence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We Anſwer (that we may not here interpoſe any thing concerning the eſſence of a Feaver) we free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grant, for ſo much as concerns the preſent Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, that a Feaver is a hot diſtemper; but this doth not chiefly conſiſt in the Natural conſtitution of the parts, but in the vital conſtitution, namely in the influent heat preternaturally affected. For a Feaver is not ſome private Diſeaſe, but univerſal, and is diffuſed from the Heart through the Arteries in and with the vital Spirit, be it either overheated, or otherwiſe viciated. For this preternatural heat hath only a reſpect to that inherent as a cauſe potent and able variouſly to alter it, yet indeed by degrees and little and little. For firſt the influent heat is manifeſtly an actual heat, but the heat of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſtitution is only potential: wherefore we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that a cold diſtemper in reſpect of a natural and potential heat may conſiſt with a hot diſtemper in reſpect of an actual and influent heat. For indeed an actual heat is not ſo directly averſe to a cold di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is ſo called by reaſon of a defect of the potential heat, but it may (the cauſe perſevering) conſiſt for a good while with it. As for example, there is an actual heat in Simple Water, Barly Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, diverſe Juleps and the like being made hot, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though at the ſame time they are potentially cold. So that to be actually hot, and potentially hot differ not in the Degree, but in the Species, neither are they ſo directly contrary to one another, that one
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:169706:24"/>
muſt preſently expel the other out of a ſubject.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Secondly, The influent hot diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per doth not ſo much correct the inherent cold di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, as by accident it augmenteth it, namely by a waſt and diſſipation of the Natural Spirits, wherein chiefly the natural and potential heat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides: Juſt after the ſame manner as the actual heat introduced by the fire diminiſheth the poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial heat of the Wine. Whereupon any kind of Feaver ſupervening upon this Diſeaſe, uſually brings more damage than advantage to the ſick.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We affirm, a moiſt diſtemper to be lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged together in the parts firſt affected; this is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt from the laxity and ſoftneſs of the ſaid parts: and this ſign likewiſe doth more ſtrongly confirm the ſame thing, becauſe the ſaid parts are extenuated, ſo that unleſs there were a redundancy of moiſture in them, a certain rigidity and roughneſs would aſſault the touch; again, a cold diſtemper doth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rarely continue long without a moiſt: and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, things helpful and hurtful atteſt this truth, for drying things are helpful, and moiſtning things are hurtful.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we affirm, That in the parts firſt affected there is a penury of natural ſpirits. This is proved by the very ſame arguments which we produced to evince it to be a cold diſtemper.</p>
            <p>For firſt the unequal and imminute nutrition of the parts firſt affected doth not only argue a coldneſs of temper, but withal, a want of natural ſpirits, for otherwiſe this defect of nutrition might be eaſily corrected. For the cauſe of that coldneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the defect of the ſpirit is conjoyned, or ſome peccaut humor is not impacted, is eaſily caſhired,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:169706:25"/>
and ſooner then is wont in this diſeaſe, as may b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſeen in the parts grown extream cold in the winte ſeaſon; for example ſake, in the handling of ſnow; the parts ſo extreamly cooled provided that they be rightly handled, wil return to their priſtine tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in few hours: but wher there is a diſtemper with the matter of it, as a caſe conjoynd, or where ther is a defect of the inherent ſpirits, ſuch a diſtemper indeed is not ſo ſoon nor ſo eaſily removed. But in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent affect we cannot affirm that a conjoyned or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted matter of any note is (at the leaſt alwiſe) cauſed in the parts firſt affected, becauſe they are obſerved to be more withered, feeble, and extreamly exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated, and ſeeing this affect is very different from <hi>Cachexia</hi> and the Virgins diſeaſe; in the which for the moſt part, it is not the want of Spirits, but the conjoyned matter that cheriſheth the cold diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: wherefore we may rightly infer that the perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacity of this evil doth chiefly depend upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the natural Spirits. Secondly, The ſame is proved after the ſame manner by the ſecond argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before alleadged for the cold diſtemper, nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from ſloth and averſneſs to excerciſe. For acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity hath not only a dependance upon the temper, but chiefly upon the fulneſs of the Spirits: as may be ſeen in ſtrong and heathful men, who in winter time, and hardeſt froſt, are more prompt and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to violent exerciſes, then in ſummer, when the inherent Spirits are wont to be ſomwhat diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Thirdly, Feavers, and long extenuating diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as they often introduce a cold diſtemper, ſo they evidently diminiſh and diſſipate the inherent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. To theſe we ad that argument which is dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the conſtitution of the Parents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents that are more ſtrong and luſty (experience
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:169706:25"/>
witneſſeth it) and accuſtomed to labour, ſeldom bring forth children obnoxious to this diſeaſe: on the contrary, ſuch as are weak, ſickly, idle, tender, delicate, very prone to immoderate, premature, or decriped Venery, ſuch as are troubled with a <hi>Gonor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhea,</hi> &amp;c. for the moſt part beget children ſubject to this affect: Namely, becauſe the Seminary princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are furniſhed only with a deficiency of Spirits. We ſhould now proceed to the fourth aſſertion, but muſt firſt remove a <hi>remora</hi> that cometh in the way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> For ſome may object. <hi>That the natural cold diſtemper is ſubordinated to the want of Spirits, and not contradiſtinguiſhed to it, as is here ſuppoſed. For the paucity of the Spirits ſeemeth to be the very cauſe of the cold diſtemper, and the natural heat be it more intenſe or more remiſs, ſeemeth reſpectively to follow the proportion of the natural Spirits, as being radicated in them as their firſt ſubject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We anſwer.</hi> Firſt, That the inherent heat is indeed firſt grounded and ſubjected in the inherent Spirits. Moreover as the inward heat is divided into two par s, namely, the natural, and the acquired heat; ſo the inward Spirit muſt be alſo conceived to be two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, the primigenial or ſeminal derived from the Parents in the ſeed, and the acquired Spirit contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from a perfect aſſimilation of the aliment, the former Spirit is the baſis of the engrafted natural heat, the latter of the inward acquired heat; we mean, not that theſe heats and Spirits are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves diſtinct in the ſpecies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but only in their origin and degree of perfection, which is ſufficient to inveſt them with a various appellation. For in nutrition the aſſimilation of the aliment proceedeth even to a ſpecifical identity, and not an individual, although ſometimes, alſo it attaineth not the degree of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:169706:26"/>
perfection. For which cauſe it ſeemed ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to us to have named the implanted heat, and the implanted Spirit, without any high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er diſtinction; and therefore we grant that the implanted heat is firſt ſubjected and rooted in the Spirits, and that it is nothing elſe then a certain mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of the ſaid Spirits, whereby they being irradiated by the vital heat do delight to indeavor to diffuſe themſelves and to enlarge their dominions, by attracting, retaining, aſſimilating the aliments like unto themſelves by ſevering the excrements, and laſtly, by diſpoſing the things acquired in due places: we ſay, likewiſe that this endeavor (wherin we place the eſſence of heat) by reaſon that it is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſive doth ſomwhat diſſipate and waſt the implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Spirits, which becauſe of this effect are vulgarly called by the name of radical moiſture continually devoured and conſumed by the heat. Thus far we grant the argument: But in the ſecond place we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that the implanted heat doth differ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hot implanted temperament; for the implanted heat is only a part of the hot <hi>implanted temperament,</hi> for not only a Spirit, but ſulphur alſo, and ſalt, or perhaps choler, contribute their heat to the conſtitution of the whole hot implanted temperament, wherof the implanted heat is only a part. Wherefore it is faſly ſuggeſted in the propounded argument, that a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Spirits is the ſole cauſe of a hot diſtemper, and a paucity of a cold diſtemper: for a pound of the fleſh of an infant containeth more implanted Spirits then a pound of a yongmans fleſh: yet it is moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that the temperament of a yong man is far more hot then that of an infant: a hot temperament cannot therefore depend upon the ſole plenty of the <hi>Spirits,</hi> nor a cold temperament upon a want of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:169706:26"/>
Spirits. Moreover in many maladies a hot diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is conſiſtent with a paucity of Spirits; as in a <hi>Hectick</hi> of the third degree; in like manner of a cold diſtemper with a competent plenty of Spirits, as in the Green ſickneſs.</p>
            <p>We ſay thirdly, That a plenty or paucity of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits is not perpetually a ſufficient cauſe to determine the temperament either hot or cold; as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, neither doth a hot, nor a cold temperament certainly and neceſſarily demonſtrate a plenty or paucity of Spirits, as is manifeſt from the inſtance given. So that the temperament is no ſure ſign of the quantity of the Spirits, nor the quantity of the Spirits a ſure ſign of the temperament; and therfore purpoſeth not without juſt cauſe, theſe things come to be conſidered and examined as contradiſtinct, if we wil procure a certain and inconfuſed knowledge of them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly we anſwer, That although it were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the implanted heat is ſubjected in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted <hi>Spirits,</hi> yet notwithſtanding that heat is not intended nor remitted according to the ſole plenty, or paucity of <hi>Spirits:</hi> for the <hi>Spirits</hi> howſoever ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently copious, yet if they be too much fixed, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, and as it were frozen; they exhibit not any implanted heat worthy of conſideration. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the white of an egge ſwelleth with copious <hi>Spirits,</hi> yet are they ſo benummed, and the inward heat is thereupon ſo ſmall, that it obtaineth not the formation of a chicken, unleſs it be firſt excited by incubation, or ſome ſuch other heat; therefore we may lawfully conclude, that a conſideration from the want of <hi>Spirits</hi> is ſufficiently diſtinct from the conſideration of a cold implanted temperament, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the objected argument doth ſeem to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate

               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:169706:29"/>
the contrary. Moreover from this fourth article of our anſwer, there reſulteth a fourth aſſertion of the eſſence propounded, Namely,</p>
            <p>That beſide the diſtemper and want of <hi>Spirits</hi> a certain benumdneſs of them, muſt be added as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct part alſo of the eſſence of the diſeaſe. This benumdneſs of the engraffed <hi>Spirits</hi> appeareth chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the defective nutrition, and averſation from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, which proceed not primarily (as we have proved above) from any defect of the influx of the brain. It is alſo manifeſt from hence, becauſe all thoſe things which drive out that ſtupefaction of the <hi>Spirits,</hi> although they do not altogether drive it away, yet they conduce very much to the cure of this diſeaſe; as exerciſes of any kind augmented by degrees, frictions, anoyntings, &amp;c. and things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly taken, of a heating, cutting, purging, and gently opening quality. But that this benumdneſs is ſufficiently diſtinct from the want of Spirits (beſides that which we have ſaid in the 3. article of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is ſufficiently manifeſt from hence, becauſe an exceſſive excitation, contrary to a benummednes is often conjoyned with a penury of <hi>Spirits:</hi> as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly falleth out in a <hi>Hectick</hi> feaver, in diſſolving fluxes, and the like diſeaſes, in which howſoever there be a want of <hi>Spirits,</hi> yet no benummedneſs is conſociated; but on the contrary that vehement ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation, &amp; propenſity to motion, muſt be reſtrained.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, copious <hi>Spirits</hi> may conſiſt with a benummedneſs, as in wheat or meal. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it may ſeem to have but little <hi>Spirit,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Spirits</hi> of it do yet lurk in their fixation, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummedneſs; yet indeed the <hi>Spirits</hi> do abound in it, and may be ſummoned out by a ſimple fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and excited to a manifeſtation of their <hi>activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:169706:29"/>
As ſtrong Beer made thereof doth plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. In like manner juice newly preſſed out of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature grapes, is very mild and pleaſant, containing in the mean time plenty of <hi>Spirits,</hi> which afterwards the due fermentation being finiſhed, reveal them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in generous wine.</p>
            <p>Let us conclude therefore that the benummed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Spirits</hi> in this affect deſerveth a particular and diſtinct conſideration.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have already propounded the firſt Eſſence of this Diſeaſe, it remaineth now that we enquire after the firſt Subject in which that Eſſence is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated.</p>
            <p>The heart and the brain do here ſeem rightly to be excluded, for the reaſons before alleadged, the repetition whereof for brevity ſake we ſhal omit.</p>
            <p>The liver and the Lungs are not as yet exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from all ſuſpition of this fault, we wil therfore examine theſe bowels apart, and firſt we demand,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether the Liver be the ſubject of the firſt eſſence of this Diſeaſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The principal Argument is for the Affirmative, becauſe this Diſeaſe may ſeem to proceed from a vicious ſanguification, the Shop and Work-houſe whereof (at leaſt in probability) the Liver is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be, but that a viciated ſanguification is the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:169706:30"/>
firſt origine of this diſeaſe ſeems to be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by many ſigns. Firſt, becauſe this diſeaſe for the moſt part followeth after many other great diſeaſes, either acute or chronical, which in great meaſure have beforehand weakned the ſanguifical vertue of the Liver. Secondly, Becauſe this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe doth not only depend upon outward, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cauſes, namely the vicious humors. And ſeing the vicious humors are generated in and with the mas of blood in the liver, the firſt eſſence of this affect ſeemeth to be referred hither. Thirdly, The Liver is perpetually obſerved to be bigger than ordinary in this affect; which manifeſtly witneſſeth the Liver to be affected. Fourthly, thoſe internal Medicines which have a faculty to putrifie the blood are requiſite to the cure of this diſeaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and being exhibited are found to be very profitable. 5. The miſſian of blood from the veins of the ears (which is not the meaneſt help to vanquiſh this affect) doth more than ſufficiently argue ſome fault to be in the blood, which ſeemeth to be aſcribed to the conſtitution of the Liver, in as much as it doth ſanguificate. Theſe Arguments have ſo far prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon ſome very famous Phyſitians, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they have attributed the firſt eſſence of this diſeaſe to the Liver alone.</p>
            <p>But we conceive that theſe things may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently anſwered, if we ſhall firſt grant what can be further or what hath already been rightly ſaid concerning this matter, and then diſſolve thoſe things which are inferred by bad and invalid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Therefore we grant that the mas of blood is viciated in this affect, and that from thence is conveied a continual <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="4 letters">

We grant alſo for the preſent that the Liver is the Officin of ſanguification: but we deny that every vicioſity of the blood doth depend upon the viciated ſanguification conſtitution of the Liver. For firſt, the blood may be corrupted by unwholſom ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Liver in the mean time remaining ſound, in like manner if the firſt concoction in the ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle by any cauſe whatſoever be rendred imperfect; yet it cannot be fully corrected by the ſecond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction in the Liver be that bowel never ſo ſound. Beſides, although the generation of vicious blood ſhould be ſolely aſcribed to the Liver, yet the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts ſhould neceſſarily concur to the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of that which is generated, as the Kidneyes, the Spleen, the Pancreas, the Womb &amp;c. yea, and it ſeemeth undeniable, that all the parts which the blood waſheth in his circulation, do variouſly alter it, whilſt according to the capacity of the ſubject they imprint their qualities in it: for they are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral agents, and act by neceſſity and continually with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuſpention of their actions or intervenient pauſes, unleſs they be eſtrained by ſome predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant power: therfore if theſe be il affected, they give a greater or a leſs tincture of pollution, to the blood which paſſes through them, as may be ſeen in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion gotten by an external contact communicated to the inward parts. Moreover, ſometimes a great pollution from the other diſeaſed parts is inſinuated into the blood, the liver in the interim being ſafe, as hath been ſometimes obſerved in opened bodies, that have periſhed by a Dropſie, in whom the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was found to be ſufficiently ſound and whol. Moreover, We grant that the faults of the Blood do frequently derive their beginning from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravedneſs of their ſanguifical conſtitution of the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:169706:31"/>
Liver, and that that depraved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conſtitution is an affect of the Liver. But we deny this to be the ſame Diſeaſe whereof we now treat, becauſe it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from it in the whol Species. For that ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved conſtitution of the Liver is alike common to men of full age, to Boys, and Children; but this diſeaſe is ſolely apropriated to boys and infants. Again, We grant that a vicious conſtitution of the Liver may by generating a corrupt blood be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſe, and foment the augmentation of this affect: but we deny that to be the diſeaſe it ſelf, whereof we now ſpeak, or any part of the firſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence thereof. For it is one thing to produce a common cauſe of a diſeaſe, and another thing to be of the firſt eſſence of a diſeaſe. We deny alſo that to be the continent cauſe of this diſeaſe, or to be a ſufficient cauſe of it ſelf alone, or to be alwaies a cauſe. For the vicious conſtitution of the Liver, of what kind ſoever you will ſuppoſe it, doth not produce this affect in thoſe that are come to ripenes of yeers, nor perhaps always in yong boys: and this our anſwer in general to the argument: we proceed now in a like method to the confirmation of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Therefore we grant that this affect doth often follow other diſeaſes be they either acute or chronical, but not ſo much becauſe they had hurt the ſanguiffical conſtitution of the Liver, as becauſe they had left the outward parts cold and benummed the ingrafted Spirits exhauſted. Although we may eaſily admit the viciated liver to be able to foment the evil by reaſon of the depraved ſanguification.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We grant that this affect doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depend upon outward cauſes, but alſo upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, namely the faults of the blood it ſelf; but
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:169706:31"/>
that all theſe faults have their beginning from the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that we flatly deny for the Reaſons before allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We grant that the mole or ſubſtance of the Liver is augmented in this affect, but we deny that to be the firſt eſſence of the Diſeaſe, for the reaſons above rehearſed, where we reject the organical vices from the primary eſſence of this evil. Yet we admit this and the like diſeaſes in a ſecondary eſſence of this affect, as we ſhal ſee hereafter.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, We grant that internal Medicines can both alter and purify the blood, but in the preſent Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect they conduce to the cure, in this regard, principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe they facilitate the diſtribution of the blood to the outward members, attenuating the thicker and cutting the viſcous parts thereof, and becauſe they alſo do impregnate the blood, with a copious and benign Spirit, whereupon it happens, that the implanted Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the parts before languiſhing, are cheriſhed, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and excited. In the mean time we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that general benefit which accrew to the whole body, by the purging of the blood, by ſiedge, vomit, urine, or any other ways of evacuation. Only this is it which we affirm, that the more ſpecifical part of the cure is wrought by way of alteration with the medicines aforeſaid, as we have intimated already.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, and laſtly, We grant that the opening the veins in the ears doth ſomewhat attenuate the blood, and conduce to the renovation of it, as alſo to the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it to the external parts, and the withdrawing of it from the internal parts oppreſſed with too much plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and in that reſpect very much to advance the cure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet we deny that it can from thence be rightly inferred that the firſt Eſſence of the diſeaſe is radicated in the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:169706:32"/>
Liver. And thus we ſuppoſe we have ſatisfied the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons brought for the confirmation of this opinion. We wil now produce ſome arguments that ſeem to perſwade the contrary.</p>
            <p>The firſt is this, The firſt Eſſence of a diſeaſe doth Specificate the Diſeaſe. But the vitiated ſanguifical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution (however it be conceived) doth not ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate this Diſeaſe. For ſeing that this Diſeaſe doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to infants only and children; it behoveth them who adhere to the contrary opinion to deſign ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain way of the depraved ſanguifical Conſtitution of the Liver, which may be proper to the tender age alone, but no depravation of the ſanguifical Conſtitution of the Liver can be imagined, which is not alſo common to thoſe of ripe years. If therefore the firſt Eſſence of this Diſeaſe ſhould conſiſt in that, this Diſeaſe would at leaſt ſometimes be obſerved in thoſe of ripe years, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding hath never been hitherto obſerved.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſubject of the firſt eſſence of a Diſeaſe is ſo long affected with that Eſſence, as the Diſeaſ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth. For neither can the Diſeaſ Exiſt without its Eſſence, neither can that Eſſence wander from one part to another: If therefore the Liver be the ſubject of the firſt Eſſence of this Diſeaſ, then ſhould it be affected thorowout the whole progreſs of the Diſeaſ; which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs doth not ſeem credible, ſeeing that the Livers of thoſe who have died of this Diſeaſ, and have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected, have excepting the augmented bulk thereof, been ſeen inculpable in reſpect of the other conditions.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If the Liver be the ſubject of the firſt Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of this Diſeaſ, neceſſarily it is, that upon the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſe of the Diſeaſe that ſhould be more grievouſly and evidently afflicted, and before death certainly it ſhould be marked by ſome manifeſt ſigns. For ſeeing
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:169706:32"/>
that every Diſeaſe is contrary to the nature of that part it beſiegeth, and doth dayly more and more damnify and empair it: And although the beginnings of Diſeaſes are many times obſcure, yet in proceſs of time (eſpecially if they continue till the laſt day of life) they imprint moſt evident marks in the parts primarily affected; ſo that it can ſcarce be avoyded, but that upon the opening of the body they will be apparent to the firſt ſight: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though alſo when an enquiry is appointed into ſome Chronical Diſeaſ, by diſſection of the body that periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, the finding of it out be grown difficult by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome other intervenient Diſeaſes, or otherwiſe complicated: Yet the part firſt affected is ever obſerved to be grievouſly and manifeſtly hurt. Seing therefore in thoſe whom this Diſeaſ hath deſtroyed, the Liver is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes ſound, excepting the augmented bulk, or at leaſt not conſiderably hurt, it will be to infer, that that bowel is not the ſubject of the firſt Eſſence of this Diſeaſ.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If the liver were the ſubject of the firſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of this diſeaſe, it ſhould labor under a cold and moiſt diſtemper, and alſo under a penury and benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medneſs of ſpirits, as is ſufficiently manifeſt from what hath already been ſpoken. But in this preſent affect the liver doth not always labor under a cold diſtemper, nor with a penury and ſtupefaction of ſpirits. For in this affect the vital blood being ſparingly diſtributed to the outward members, it muſt needs be ſuperabundantly poured upon the bowels, eſpecially the brain and the liver; and ſeeing this blood, which is circulated thorow the bowels ſo neer the heart, is made very hot and ful of ſpirit: as even now iſſuing out of the fountain of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſpirits, it is impoſſible that it ſhould permit a cold
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:169706:33"/>
diſtemper, or any defect of ſpirits to be in thoſe parts, which it watereth with ſo copious an afflux.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, In this affect we often behold the face to be wel coloured, &amp; the cheeks ruddy, which can ſcarce happen in a cold diſtemper of the liver if it be of any continuance.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, From a bad habit of breeding blood in the liver; a ſufficient reaſon cannot be rendred of the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms proper to this affect, a <hi>Cacotrophy</hi> indeed, or a viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nouriſhment, and an <hi>Atrophy,</hi> or a defective nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment: nay many times and peradventure not unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be aſcribed to the fault of the liver: but an <hi>Alogotro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi> or a diſproportional nouriſhment cannot immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately be referred to that bowel, For the liver maketh the blood equally and without difference, for al the parts; neither is it liberal to our part in the diſpenſation of it, and reſerved to another. Moreover the debility of all the muſcles, the diſlike of exerciſe, the affectation of reſt, ſeemeth to have no correſpondence with the Liver, wherefore neither do we acknowledge the Liver to be the firſt ſeat of this diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, This diſeaſe in ſtrong children is cured ſometimes, only by exerciſe, play, ſtirring, and rubbing of the body; by which means the heat is ſummoned to the outward parts, new ſpirits are raiſed up, the ſtupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of them is chaſed away, and the aliment is with a more plentiful benignity drawn to the outward mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, which benefits without doubt are more properly accommodated to the outward parts then to the Liver.</p>
            <p>And this queſtion being thus ſolved, we proceed to the other; namely,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether the Lungs be the ſubject of the firſt Eſſence of this diſeaſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſymptoms which ſeem to perſwade the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, are the frequent narrowneſs of the breaſt, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:169706:33"/>
of breathing, an <hi>aſtma,</hi> a cough, the inflamation of the Lungs, the hard ſwellings of the Lungs, the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume in the Lungs and the Ptiſick. Firſt, The nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs of the breaſt doth not preſently ariſe from the very beginning of the diſeaſ, &amp; therfore cannot be atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be of the firſt Eſſence of this Diſeaſ, in like manner the difficulty of breathing &amp; the <hi>aſtma</hi> do not perpetually accompany this affect, and therefore an indication of the part firſt affected cannot be borrowed from them. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the cough is ſometimes preſent, ſometimes abſent, and is often times variouſly intended and remitted, til the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the diſeaſe perſiſteth in the ſame ſtate; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo happeneth from very many of the aforeſaid ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms. Fourthly, An inflammation of the Lungs doth not frequently moleſt the patient, and when it invadeth him, it is an acute and not a chronicle diſeaſe; as this, whereof we now ſpeak, ſo that we cannot lawfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any certainty of the firſt affected part from a ſymptom ſo unuſual and ſo Fugitive. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Hard ſwellings of the Lungs, little ſwellings, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtumes; yea, and bunches may precede, aſſociate, and follow after this affect, but theſe diſeaſes are altogether of a different kind from that we now ſpeak of; yea, and are common as well to men of ripe years as to children, and infants: moreover the <hi>Ptyſick</hi> doth not uſually ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perveen unleſs after a long continuance of this affect, as being far from the firſt Eſſence of this Diſeaſ; and that it may manifeſtly appear to be very remote from the firſt eſteem of it, ſo that can confer little or nothing to the finding out of the part affected. Moreover, thoſe inſeparable and vulgar ſymptoms of this Diſeaſ, as the impotency of the external parts to motion, and the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of nutrition, can by no reaſon be deduced from the affected Lungs: and therefore we cannot admit this
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:169706:34"/>
Bowel for the firſt ſeat of this Diſeaſ. And thus at length we deſcend to point out the parts firſt affected.</p>
            <p>The ſpecial marrow iſſuing out of the skull doth ſeem to deſerve the firſt place: The ſecond, all the Nerves produced by it; the third all the membranous and fibrous parts unto which thoſe Nerves are carried along. And in theſe parts we affirm the firſt eſſence of of this diſeaſ to be rooted, neither do we think it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to joyn other parts with theſe. For the ſoftneſs, looſneſs, and <hi>Atony</hi> of the whol Spine without the Skul, of all the Nerves ariſing from thence, of all the Fibers of the Univerſal Body, and by that means an inability to motion, a ſlothfulneſs and affectation of reſt, which bewray themſelves from the very beginning of this affect, do abundantly evince theſe parts to be affected with coldneſs, defect and benummedneſs of Spirits, and from hence it comes to paſs that they are extenuated and afflicted with an incompetency of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment. For they do ſomewhat communicate their benummedneſs to the tops of the Arteries, whereupon the Flux of blood that is deſtributed unto them, ſuffers diminution; and becauſe they are cold and labor under a defect of Spirits, they imperfectly concoct the affuſed blood, ſo that there is a neceſſity that they muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duly nouriſhed and leſs than the other parts, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence be extenuated. Therefore we juſtly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly aſcribe the firſt eſſence of this Diſeaſ to thoſe parts alone.</p>
            <p>Yet it may be here doubted whether the bones may not alſo be numbred among the parts firſt affected, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that certain tumors of the bones may be obſerved preſently after the firſt invaſion of the Diſeaſ in divers places, but eſpecially in the appendancies of the Bones to the Wreſts and tops of the Ribs, where they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:169706:34"/>
with the grizles of the Stern?</p>
            <p>We anſwer, That indeed it cannot be denied, but that the ſaid tumors of the bones, both in reſpect of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed greatneſs, and alſo by reaſon of the viciated fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure are really and truly Diſeaſes, and therefore we grant that the bones muſt be referred to the primary or ſecondary eſſence of the Diſeaſ: but that they do not pertain to the primary eſſence of the Diſeaſe is manifeſt from hence, Becauſe the ſaid tumors of the bones de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the firſt eſſence of this Diſeaſ, and ſuppoſe the preexiſtence of it. For they ſpring from the une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual nouriſhment of the parts which is a Symptom of the firſt eſſence of this Diſeaſ. But here the inequality of the nouriſhment can depend upon the firſt eſſence of this Diſeaſ, ſhall more fully be declared in its due place; namely, where the reaſon of the ſecondary eſſence is to be rendred. We will only here ſhew that thoſe ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of the bones are rightly deduced from the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate nouriſhment, to wit when in reſpect of the reſt it is too much augmented in the ſwelling parts. That is proved by this argument, Becauſe the protube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant part of the bones are altogether of the ſame Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies with the other parts of the bones; whereupon it is neceſſary, that they come out by the ſame way of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, by which the reſt are augmented and encreaſ. Therefore ſeeing that the other bones are augmented by nutrition, that is, by the introſumed aliment, and the aſſimilation of it, certainly we muſt judg that theſe bones alſo acquire their augmentation by the like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (although without reaſon, meaſure and proportion) You will ſay, That tumors are uſually generated not of an alimentory or good, but a corrupt and vicious juyce. True it is indeed that this is for the moſt part true, but as true it is that it is only for the moſt part true. For
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:169706:35"/>
ſome tumors ſwell from a legitimate and alimentary juyce, as caruncles or little pieces of fleſh, knobbed ſwellings, and perhaps ſome hard bunches, but even theſe ſwellings do alſo differ much from the preſent ſtanding out of the bones. For thoſe tumors which we uſe to call excreſcences, have ſomewhat in them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the habit of the part and in the whol kind beſide nature: but theſe tumors do not grow without the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the part, neither do they include or contain any other preternatural thing beſide the ſole magnitude diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionately encreaſed, and by that means the vicia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted figure of the parts. For otherwiſe theſe ſwellings ſhould not be of the ſame Species with the reſt of the Bone, to which they are continued, but that is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the experience of the ſences.</p>
            <p>If therefore it be granted that ſome tumors (even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe which are altogether preternatural and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt without the habit of their body) are generated of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limentary juyces, certainly much leſs hard is it to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that theſe ſwellings of the bones are generated and formed of the legitimate matter of the bones, by the inherent nutritive faculty. And this is clearly confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by this, becauſe the bones according to their ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary nature are by no means legitimately produced by an illegitimate matter, that is, an indiſpoſed and diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable matter to the other ſimilary bones. <hi>Ex quolibet ligno non fit Mercurius,</hi> Every natural agent diſpoſeth the matter before it can introduce the form. It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary alſo that the matter ſo diſpoſed be legitimate. Now the matter of the ſwelling bones is manifeſtly diſpoſed; for otherwiſe it could not actually receive the ſpecifical form of a bone. Moreover that theſe tumors of the bones are generated by the nutritive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is likewiſe evident, becauſ in all our body there is
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:169706:35"/>
not any other oſſifical vertue beſides that nutritive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty inherent in the bones themſelves, becauſe alſo theſe tumors are generated and augmented by the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed aliment, and aſſimilated by the bones themſelvs: although perhaps in reſpect of the whole Bone this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the aliment may be unequal, and a ſufficient cauſe of error in the nutritive faculty, whereby one part of thoſe Bones may be too ſparingly nouriſhed, and another part too plentifully even to a tumor.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VII. Of the Secondary Eſſence of this Diſeaſ.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He firſt and Radical Eſſence of this Diſeaſ, and alſo the parts firſt affected being explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, now in the next place the Secondary Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; namely that which immediatly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth this Diſeaſ, offereth it ſelf to our examination. And here we muſt refreſh the memory by an intimation of that threefold Conſtitution already aſſerted, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, the Vital, the Animal, and thorow theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Conſtitutions, ſhall our examination proceed. And firſt we will conſider the Natural Conſtitution. This as we have taught above conſiſteth in the <hi>Temperament,</hi> common qualites, the plenty and diſpoſition of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Spirits, in the Organization, and continuity: now we have already proved, that the firſt Eſſence of this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is radicated in the <hi>Temperament,</hi> and in the plenty and diſpoſition of the Natural Spirits: but the other
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:169706:36"/>
parts of this Conſtitution, to wit, the common quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the Organization, and the continuity do yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to be examined.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Common Qualities</hi> we underſtand in a manner the ſame which ſome others have called the <hi>Modos Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae,</hi> and others, <hi>Qualitates Secundas.</hi> Now we cal them <hi>Common,</hi> becauſe they are not reſtrained to any one Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Form; but in ſome ſort may expiate and range thorow all the Bodies, and for the moſt part affect them more or leſs. Of this ſort are denſity, rarity, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, fluidneſs, tenacity, friability, laxity, tenſion, (or rather tenſity, that the habit may be diſtinguiſhed from the action) witheredneſs, ſwelling, and ſtifneſs, ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, hardneſs, ſmoothneſs, roughneſs. But it is not our meaning, exactly to reckon up all and each of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Qualities,</hi> nor to proſecute thoſe already rehearſed, further then the preſent occaſion ſhall require.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Tone</hi> or <hi>Harmony</hi> of the Parts doth ſeem to reſult from ſome <hi>Common Qualities</hi> mutually embraced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves. For the <hi>Tone</hi> of the Parts properly conſiſteth in a du tenor and mediocrity between certain oppoſite <hi>Common Qualities,</hi> as between thickneſs and thinneſs, &amp;c. But if there be a receſs or departure from the juſt mediocrity to either of the extreams, then there is a neceſſity that the <hi>Tone</hi> muſt be vitiated. Two things therefore do here ſeem to be enquired after concerning the <hi>Tone</hi> of the Parts; the firſt, whether in this Diſeaſ the <hi>Tone</hi> of the Parts be in any degree vitiated. The next, Whether thoſe faults of the <hi>Tone</hi> do belong to the ſecondary Eſſence of the Diſeaſ.</p>
            <p>As concerning the firſt, It wil be unneceſſary to run thorow the particular Parts of the <hi>Tone</hi> ſeverally, it will be ſufficient to examine thoſe that ſeem guilty of the ſuſpected crime.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:169706:36"/>
Firſt, Therefore we meet with an evident looſneſs of the <hi>Tone</hi> in this affect: But this looſneſs differeth both from the infirm coherence, and likewiſe from the <hi>Paralytical</hi> reſolution of the Parts: for the infirm co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence or weakned ſtifneſs of the part is eaſily made an occaſion of the looſneſs, becauſe in ſuch caſes the Part can ſcarce be ſtretched forth; but a part may at the ſame time be both looſe, and likewiſe ſufficiently ſtiff, as may be ſeen in the ſtrings of Inſtruments, which if you wind down the pins, they become looſe, although in the mean time they forgo not the tenacity of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. And in diſſected bodies we have frequently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the looſe parts themſelves to be ſufficiently ſtiff; yea, and that ſometimes in this affect. Wherefore this looſneſs is a diſtinct quality from the vitiated ſtifneſs of a Part. Neither doth it leſs differ from that reſolution of the Parts which happeneth in the <hi>Paralytical</hi> Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. For the dead Palſy firſt conſiſteth in the depraved Animal Conſtitution: But this looſneſs is rooted in the Natural Conſtitution. For here is no Palſy preſent either in reſpect of motion, or in reſpect of the ſence of the Parts: Neither is the Brayn in this Diſeaſ prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily affected, as we have already demonſtrated. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that there is ſuch an exceeding looſneſs of the Parts firſt affected, in this Diſeaſ is a thing ſo conſpicuous, that we judg it a ſuperfluous employment to offer proof thereof. For it is obvious to the very ſenſes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have liſted it among the ſigns of the Diſeaſ. For whether it be a Part of the Eſſence or not a Part, if it be manifeſtly ſubjected to the Senſes, it acquireth the propriety of a ſign in reſpect of the other Parts of the Eſſence, which are removed from the Senſes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In this Diſeaſ there is not only a looſneſs but likewiſe a witheredneſs, and feebleneſs. Now this
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:169706:37"/>
quality comprehendeth ſomwhat more then the meer and ſimple looſneſs; for it denoteth withal a certain emptineſs of the parts, wherby they ſink down of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Now ſuch an emptineſs, and ſuch a falling down of the Parts firſt affected in this Diſeaſ are ſo obvious to the Senſes, that there is no need of further proof.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A a ſoftneſs alſo may be named in the <hi>Tone</hi> of the Parts firſt affected in this Diſeaſ. For ſometimes it ſo falleth out that there is no coincidence between the ſoftneſs and the aforeſaid qualities; but that it inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth or excludeth ſome other thing, as in a ſuppurated Tumor there is ſoftneſs, but without any laxity of the Tone, any emptineſs or ſubſidence. For in this preſent ſuppoſed caſe the ſoftneſs chiefly dependeth upon the manner of Termination, and the tenacity of the Part being vitiated. But in this affect there is for the moſt part a coincidence with the laxity and flaccidity before mentioned: So that it is needleſs to diſtinguiſh it more accurately then by the name only.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, There happeneth alſo another fault in the <hi>Tone</hi> of the Parts firſt affected in this Diſeaſ, and this is an extream inward ſlipperineſs. Some perhaps may wonder what the meaning of theſe words may be, <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal lubricity.</hi> We confeſs indeed that for want of words we have been conſtrayned to joyn this appellation. For when in nature ſuch a quality as hath a true exiſtence hath by the overſight of Philoſophers, and alſo the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of Grammarians wanted a name, we have taken ſo much liberty to our ſelvs, as in reſpect of the great vicini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which it hath with the ſuperficial lubricity of the body to give it the ſame Name, with the diſtinctive <hi>Epethite</hi> of Internal. In natural bodies therfore we acknowledg a twofold lubricity; one External and Superficial which indeed conſiſteth in the ſmoothneſs and equality of the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:169706:37"/>
Parts of the Superficies, by reaſon whereof the Subject of it doth eaſily ſlide by other bodies which it lighteth upon without much attrition and reſiſtance, Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this lubricity, is the Superficial roughneſs: but theſe two qualities have no reference to this place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are Organical, neither do they any way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the <hi>Tone</hi> of the Parts. That other lubricity whereof we began to make mention, conſiſts in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, profound and ſimilary ſmoothneſs, and equality of the body. By reaſon wherof, the whole ſubſtance of its Subject doth eaſily ſlide by the other introſubient bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies without much attrition and reſiſtance. And to this lubricity alſo there is an Internal roughneſs. Now that there is ſuch an internal ſimilary ſlipperineſs, and ſuch a roughneſs alſo oppoſite unto it may be ſhewed almoſt by innumerable inſtances. For almoſt all mucilaginous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are ſlippery, and that not only in reſpect of the outward Superficies, but alſo inwardly, and in reſpect of the univerſal Subſtance, and every particle thereof; ſo that, according to the definition of a ſimilary body, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particle, by reaſon of this quality is made like unto the whol, and therfore this quality is internal, and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milary, and diffuſed through the whol internal ſubſtance of the Subject. In like manner ſuch an internal roughneſs may be obſerved in unripe fruits, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended thorow their whole ſubſtance and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fleſh. But when they have attained to a juſt ripeneſs then uſually, in the room of that roughneſs there ſucceedeth ſuch a ſlipperineſs as we have now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. And here it muſt be obſerved, that if theſe bodies internally ſlippery be beſmeared or daubed upon the Superficies of bodies otherwiſe rough, they bequeath a certain degree of lubricity to them, for the time they adhere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in like manner being inwardly taken as the ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:169706:38"/>
juyces, and mucilages of <hi>Althea,</hi> &amp;c. They do communicate a certain lubricity to the Internal paſſages of the Body; yea, and not only to the paſſages that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the inward cavities, but alſo more or leſs to the very Similary ſubſtance of the parts of the Body, which alſo the blood waſheth being impregnated with that ſlippery juyce.</p>
            <p>But this internal lubricity is manifold: oyly or fat, watriſh, ſpiritous, ſaltiſh, and perhaps earthy. The oyly is chiefly conſpicuous in the fat of Creatures, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch as are yong, and in many expreſſed Oyls, eſpecially the moiſter and colder, and alſo the temperate; as may be obſerved in the Oyls of Poppy Seeds, Pippin Seeds, the four greater Cold Seeds, Time Seed, and the Oyl of ſweet Almonds, and the like. A watriſh lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricity is in ſome meaſure found in ſimple water it ſelf, although by reaſon of the fluidneſs it is leſs ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; alſo this lubricity may moſt evidently be taken notice of in the mucilages, &amp;c. The Spiritous perhaps doth never happen alone, but it is moſt frequently mixt with the wateriſh, as in the ſperm of almoſt all Creatures, and ripe fruits. The Saltiſh likewiſe is rarely ſimple, although there is a man that contendeth it is to be found in ſalt of Tartar. But the compound ſaltiſh lubricity is frequently obvious, as in Soap and Salt of Tartar diſſolved with wateriſh and oyly ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Earthy (even mixt) is ſcarce worthy of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, unleſs it be in reſpect that it concurreth to the thickning of fluid bodies, as in white clayiſh Mud, and Fullers Earth diſſolved. But in this place we have regard chiefly to that lubricity which is wateriſh, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that alone which can be guilty of the crime in this affect we now handle,</p>
            <p>And theſe things may ſuffice in general of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:169706:38"/>
or ſimilary lubricity. The next enquiring muſt be whether the firſt affected parts of this Diſeaſ be affected beyond a due proportion with an internel or ſimilary lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricity. And at firſt indeed it ſeemeth very probable that there is ſuch an extream lubricity in the ſaid parts, becauſ moiſture doth ſuperabound in them, which ever favoreth the ſaid lubricity, be it conjoyned either with heat or cold. Every one knoweth that the Sperm of Creatures by how much it is moiſter than the creatures produced by it, by ſo much alſo it is the more ſlippery: in like manner that the yong fleſh of Creatures is more ſlippery than that of old. Seeing therefore that humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and lubricity of this kind are ſo inwardly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Seing alſo that in the parts firſt affected there is manifeſtly an extream humidity, certainly it may eaſily be granted that a lubricity likewiſe doth too much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in the ſaid parts. And to the production of this the benummedneſs of thoſe parts have no ſmall ſhare. For the Spirits when they are in their exaltation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract a kind of acrimony and ſharpneſs, as may be ſeen by comparing Muſt with old Wine, or with Spirit of Wine or with <hi>Aqua vitae.</hi> For the Spirits of Muſt may truly be ſaid to be benummed or ſtupified, if they be compared with the Spirits of old Wine; and by how much more they are ſtupified, ſo much more lubricity they likewiſe contain, and alſo ſo much the leſs of ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and acrimony. From whence it is manifeſt that that benummedneſs and dulneſs in the Spirits lodging in the firſt affected parts doth favor that extrem lubrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for that dulneſs of the Spirits in the ſaid parts is almoſt of the ſame degree with the dulneſs of the Spirits in Muſt. And becauſ the Spirits are defective in the parts firſt affected, it is evident that this lubricity is an over-watriſh lubricity. Moreover, laxity, flaccidity,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:169706:39"/>
and ſoftneſs do alſo ſeem to conſpire. For unripe fruit as they are hard, ſo till they wax ripe they grow ſofter and ſofter, and withal acquire an internal lubricity; in like manner the parts are looſned by relaxant baths, and together they become more ſlippery; alſo ſlippery things taken inwardly, as the mucilage of <hi>Althea,</hi> &amp;c. Do not only looſen the Parts, but they alſo make the paſſages ſlippery, for which caſe in the pains of the ſtone they are drank with good juyces. Again, this lubricity of the firſt affected parts, ſeemeth to be much confirmed by this, becauſe in the diſſected Bodies a manifeſt lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricity is obſervable by the touch; and if they be ſquee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed a mucilaginous kind of blood, inwardly beſmearing them, is cruſhed out with the fingers. We ſay nothing of the skin, which for the moſt part is ſlippery in this affect, and is ſeldom felt to be rough to the touch: but it is worthy to be noted, that extream ſlippery Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines either outwardly applyed, or inwardly taken, do uſually more hurt then good in this Diſeaſ. And thus we abſolve the former queſtion, of the manner whereby the <hi>Tone</hi> of the Parts is vitiated in this Affect. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now preſents it ſelf to our conſideration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether the Tone vitiated after that manner as hath been ſaid, be a Part of the Eſſence of this Diſeaſ?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſuppoſe here that whatſoever is found to be viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in the Body, is either a morbifical cauſe, or a Symptom, or the Diſeaſ it ſelf; and therfore this Diſeaſ either ſimple or compound, or any part of a compound, and that either primary or ſecondary.</p>
            <p>We ſay firſt, That the vitiated <hi>Tone</hi> above propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded is not properly a cauſe of the Diſeaſ. And this ſcarce need any proof. For the ſaid <hi>Tone</hi> is a preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conſtitution, rooted in the Parts themſelves, and by that reaſon it is moſt evidently diſtinguiſhed from a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:169706:39"/>
morbifical cauſe properly ſo called. For although, one Diſeaſ may be the cauſe of another, nevertheleſs even then it is not properly called a morbifical cauſe, but a primary Diſeaſ, and that other which it produceth, a a ſecondary affect. But every where there is a growing together of them both into one total Diſeaſ, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wil be the primary Part of the Eſſence, and the latter the ſecondary part of the Eſſence.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We affirm, that the deſcribed <hi>Tone</hi> of the Parts is not a meer Symptom, for it is not under the things ſecured and retained, neither can it be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under any depraved action, or any changed qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, not vitiating the action. But that the vitiated <hi>Tone</hi> is not comprehended under the things ſecured and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, nor under any depraved action, may by the ſame labor be proved by this Reaſon, becauſe thoſe kind of Symptoms are not indeed Conſtitutions of the body; but the ſaid vitiated <hi>Tone</hi> without controverſy is a preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural changed conſtitution, as we have already moſt playnly demonſtrated. Secondly, That the ſaid <hi>Tone</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated after that manner, is not contained under any changed quality, not depraving the action, is ſo clear and evident, that it needs no proof. For laxity and flac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidity hurteth the motion of the Parts, and an extream lubricity is an impediment to the du quickning of the vital Spirits, as ſhal hereafter be made manifeſt.</p>
            <p>It may be Objected, <hi>That ſome bare changed qualities which are comprehended under the Genus of Symptoms, may alſo vitiate an action: as the colour changed in the skin yeeldeth an unpleaſant proſpect to the beholder, ſo that it begetteth deformity and defect of du comlineſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We anſwer, That the changed colour of the Skin in as much as it vitiateth the beauty therof (which is the proper action of the Skin) doth in rigor (in a large
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:169706:40"/>
acception) fall under the Notion of a Diſeaſ. But ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this action of the Skin is only <hi>Objecture</hi> and <hi>Ad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> and ſeing that altered color doth hurt no Internal action of that individual: Phyſitians, who in the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of a Diſeaſ, have reſpect only to the Internal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that individual, do uſually exclude it from the Claſſis of Diſeaſes. Or if the vitiated color of a part do chance in ſome place to deprave an internal action (which is known only to happen in the Tunicle of the Eye, called <hi>Corura)</hi> the beſt Phyſitians do ever reckon it for a Diſeaſ, although perhaps ſecondarily. But that we may return into the way from whence we have a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle erred: ſeing that the vitiated <hi>Tone</hi> may hurt, as we have ſaid, the internal actions, it doth not properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to that kind of Symptom, which is wont to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the name of a changed quality.</p>
            <p>Thirdly we ſay, That this vitiated <hi>Tone,</hi> ſeing it is neither a Morbifical cauſ, nor a Symptom, and yet is ſomthing preternatural, muſt needs be the Diſeaſ it ſelf. Moreover, the ſame is clearly proved by the very definition of a Diſeaſ. For this vitiated <hi>Tone</hi> is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural Conſtitution, primarily or immediatly hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the internal action; therfore it is a Diſeaſ. For to what the definition is competible, to that alſo the thing defined is competible. That it is a preternatural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is manifeſt by this, becauſe it is inherent in the ſolid parts of the body: that it likewiſe depraveth the Internal actions, is manifeſt from hence, becauſe an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream laxity, lubricity, and flaccidity of the parts being granted, preſently the agility is weakned, no other cauſe approaching, and a certain ſluggiſhneſs deadeth the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritation of the vital Spirits. In agility, the matter is plain, ſeing that firm and ſtretched bodies, other things being anſwerable are more active, and ſo on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:169706:40"/>
that the ſame thing alſo happeneth in the dulneſs of the irritation ſhal be ſhewed in its place, for the preſent we labor to prove no other thing then that the vitiated <hi>Tone</hi> in this affect is a Diſeaſ.</p>
            <p>We ſay fourthly, That this vitiated <hi>Tone</hi> in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſ is not any ſimple affect, having an exiſtence apart by it ſelf, but that it is ſo conjoyned and compounded in thoſe ſame parts with the primary Eſſence, that the whole Eſſence of the Diſeaſ (wherof we diſpute) may be ſaid to conſiſt of many Diſeaſes united together (in themſelvs indeed ſimple, if they be conſidered aſunder) and therfore that the vitiated <hi>Tone</hi> is only a part of the whol Diſeaſ. And this needeth no other proof, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the firſt Eſſence propoſed above, and the ſaid viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated <hi>Tone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> are both found in thoſe ſame parts. For that is properly called a compound Diſeaſ, which is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by many ſimple Diſeaſes conjoyned in the ſame Part.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, We affirm that the vitiated <hi>Tone</hi> is not only a part of the whole Eſſence, but ſuch a part as hath ſome dependance upon the primary Eſſence, and therfore that it is a ſecondary part of the Eſſence.</p>
            <p>Before we proceed to the proof of this Propoſition two grants or conceſſions are to be premiſed.</p>
            <p>We grant firſt, That the ſaid <hi>Tone</hi> may be even im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly vitiated in other cauſes perhaps, and likewiſe by other cauſes, although that happen not in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Diſeaſ. For the inherent <hi>Tone</hi> of the Parts may be primarily looſned in the Animal Conſtitution, and that ſuddenly, as may be obſerved in the <hi>dead Palſy.</hi> For the natural tenſity (and not the Animal only) of the <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytical</hi> member is looſned, and indeed ſuddenly without any conſpicuous intervention of any part of the aforeſaid primary Eſſence. After the ſame manner in a <hi>Lipothymy</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:169706:41"/>
or defection of the mind, looſneſs and languiſhing ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly attatcheth al the parts. Now we cannot in either of theſe two cauſes refer the cauſe of the looſneſs to the cold and moiſt diſtemper of the natural Conſtitution, ſeeing that cannot be ſo ſuddenly and ſo ſenſibly chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Which let them conſider (that we may give warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it by the way) who wil have theſe common qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to be always ſecond and dependent upon the firſt alone: yea, on the other ſide let them in that cauſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how a cold and moiſt diſtemper doth afterwards by degree, follow that looſneſs ſuddenly introduced. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as for the flaccidity of the parts that may be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly produced by large evacuations, as a flux of the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſweatings, and the like immoderate vents, the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament being not yet conſiderably changed, although we deny not but this may eaſily and doth uſually follow. Moreover an internal lubricity may be manifeſtly ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from coldneſs, though very difficultly from moiſture.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We grant that in the preſent Diſeaſ, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated <hi>Tone</hi> doth not in any manner depend upon the firſt admitted Eſſence, nor that in every reſpect is ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate unto it. For firſt the qualities of the <hi>Tone</hi> here vitiated, do alſo ow ſomwhat to common cauſes, namely to themſelves, and alſo to thoſe that are common, to the firſt granted Eſſence. For extream moiſtening things by one and the ſame operation are apt to produce both too much moiſture, and alſo looſneſs. In like manner from violent evacuations, a want of Spirits, and withal a witheredneſs doth ariſe. Alſo from things too too ſlippery, either outwardly adminiſtred, or inwardly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, or both, an internal lubricity is augmented, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a moiſt diſtemper. For there is ſo great a connexion of the whole Eſſence, hitherto propounded
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:169706:41"/>
with the common cauſes, that there is ſcarce any thing which doth augment the firſt eſſence of the Diſeaſ, but at the ſame time more or leſs it hath an influence upon the vitiated <hi>Tone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things bring granted, We ſay notwithſtanding that in the preſent affect there is a very great dependance of the vitiated <hi>Tone</hi> upon the firſt Eſſence of this Diſeaſ; for which reſpect alone we have here referred the vitiated <hi>Tone</hi> to the ſecondary Eſſence. If any liſt to contend, <hi>That the ſaid Tone in another reſpect may relate more clearly to the Secondary Eſſence,</hi> becauſe he may imagine that the primary Eſſence of every Diſeaſ is neceſſarily ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milary and perpetually grounded upon the firſt qualities alone; or becauſe he may conceive that the qualities wherein the <hi>Tone</hi> conſiſteth are perpetually ſecondary, and that they follow the firſt only (as the ſhadow doth the Sun) that man may take notice that we purpoſely decline ſuch queſtions, leaſt we ſhould ſtraggle into an unwarrantable digreſſion.</p>
            <p>It remaineth therefore only that we prove the Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the vitiated <hi>Tone</hi> upon the firſt Eſſence of this Diſeaſ to be very great, and that we ſhal do by parts. We wil begin at the laxity. We grant indeed that a laxity may be ſomtimes ſuddenly produced, and in that cauſe a moyſt diſtemper may often follow upon it, Namely, when the laxity primarily dependeth upon the fault ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Animal or Vital Conſtitution; but in this Diſeaſ, ſeing that neither the Animal nor the Vital Conſtitution are primarily affected, there is a neceſſity that it muſt flow from other cauſes. Moreover, ſuch is the condition of laxity and tenſity, that they are obnox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to ſudden alterations. For the ſtrings of a Lute may almoſt in a moment be ſtretched and looſned again; the ſame thing likewiſe from ſome cauſes befalleth the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:169706:42"/>
of the Parts, But in this affect the laxity ſtealeth on by degrees and ſlowly; therfore neceſſary it is that it muſt begin, be ruled and moderated by ſome cauſ lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurely and ſlowly augmented. Although therfore we granted even now, that the laxity doth own ſomwhat to the common cauſes of the Diſeaſ; yet the augmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therof is chiefly reſtrained and moderated by the primary Eſſence of this Diſeaſ. For moiſtning Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines although they looſen withal, yet they ſcarce loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen more than they moiſten, becauſ for the moſt part they looſen by moiſtning. Seing therfore that the common cauſes of this Diſeaſ do flow into the Tone, chiefly by the Mediation of the firſt Eſſence of this Diſeaſ: And ſeing that neither the Animal nor the Vital Conſtitution can here ſupply the vertue of a cauſ, we may Lawfully infer that the laxity of the Tone doth chiefly depend upon the firſt Eſſence of the Diſeaſ. This is further confirmed, there is of it ſelf a certain proneſs and tendency of the Body to be through wet, ſo that the fibers of the parts muſt needs be looſned by it: Moreover, the defect of the Spirits and the ſtupefaction of them doth cauſ a remiſſion of the Tone by dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the vigor of the part. Therfore we may conclude that the Diſeaſ, laxity principally dependeth upon the primary Eſſence of the Diſeaſ. As for the flaccidity becauſe it comprehendeth the laxity, it ſpringeth from the ſame cauſes as that doth; but in as much as it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth alſo a ſubſidence and a certain emptineſs, it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently dependeth upon the defect and benummedneſs of the inherent Spirits; the plenty and vigor whereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing augmented the lank and flagging member is eaſily rendred turgid and ſwelled. In the <hi>interim</hi> we deny not but that that ſubſidence doth withal depend upon the extenuation and atrophy of the parts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:169706:42"/>
Laſtly, How the ſlipperineſs doth proceed from theſe cauſes is ſufficiently manifeſted by what hath been ſaid above.</p>
            <p>That we may at the length put a period to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it may be obſerved for the higher confirmation of thoſe things already ſpoken that there is ſuch a ſtrict de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance between the Tone and the firſt granted Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, that throughout the whol cure of the Diſeaſ they are intended &amp; remitted together almoſt in equal pace. For at firſtthe Children that are afflictedwith this affect; do only go ſlowly &amp; leiſurely whilſt the Tone of the parts is yet but a little looſned; but in the progreſs they ſcarce and with much ado truſt to their feet, then they play only ſitting or as thay are carried about. Afterwards they can ſcarce ſit upright; and at the laſt when the Diſeaſ hath attained the higheſt exaltation, the feeble neck cannot without much difficulty ſupport the burden of the head; all which things as they atteſt the primary Eſſence of the Diſeaſ to be gradually augmented, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo they make it manifeſt that the vices of the Tone are intended by an equal pace. And ſo all theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rightly weighed, we refer the viciated Tone to the ſecondary, not the primary Eſſence of this affect, and by conſequence we conclude, indeed the thing that was in queſtion, that that depraved Tone is a ſecondary part of the Eſſence of this Diſeaſ.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VIII. The Secondary Eſſence of this Diſeaſe in the Vital conſtitution.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have already propounded that part of the Secondary Eſſence of this Diſeaſ which is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated in the natural conſtitution, in as much as it comprehendeth the common qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; it remaineth now that we examin the organical vices, and the faults of continuity, if any ſuch be found out. But ſeing that no proper faults of continuity do accur in this affect, and ſeing that the organical vices do depend partly upon the Eſſence above given, and partly upon the vital conſtitution being viciated, it ſeems ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in the next place to ſearch into theſe faults of the vital conſtitution.</p>
            <p>The vital conſtitution is aptly diſtinguiſhed into the original, or that which maketh an influx, and the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipative or that which is produced by that influx.</p>
            <p>The ſubject of the original vital conſtitution are the Spirits themſelvs excited in the blood of the Arteries. You will ſay, <hi>The heart rather ſeemeth to be the ſubject of this conſtitution.</hi> But it is not ſo, for the heart it ſelf through the coronary Arteries receiveth the vital Spirits brought down with the Arterious blood from its left <hi>Ventricle.</hi> But it is abſurd to ſuppoſe the wals of the Heart to be the firſt ſubject of the vital heat, and in the mean time for thoſe to receiv that heat from the Arteries. We muſt ſay therfore that the ſolid ſubſtance
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:169706:43"/>
of the heart is indeed the firſt &amp; principal ſubject of his natural and inherent conſtitution; but ſeing that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth the Vital Spirits (as hath been ſaid) it cannot be accounted the firſt ſubject of the Vital Conſtitution, which is imprinted in it by thoſe Spirits, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no longer than the ſubſtance of the Heart is ſhedded and beſprinkled with the Vital Spirits. For neither can life ſubſiſt in any place without the Vital Spirit. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſubſtance of the Heart doth ſo far participat of the Vital conſtitution, as it is waſh'd and bedew'd with the Vital Spirits, and by Conſequence tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution in the ſubſtance of the heart is not original or influent, but participative or produced by that influx. This is alſo confirmed in that, becauſ the vital heat of the blood in the hollow Parts, or Ventricls of the Heart (which heat is at leaſt a part of the Vital Conſtitution) is for greater and more intenſiv than that which is within the wals of the Heart, as any man may obſerv by the opening of the Bodyes of living Creatures, the Ventricle of the heart being wounded, and the Finger preſently thruſt in. For he ſhall feel a far more aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented heat in the blood, than in the very ſubſtance of the <hi>Ventricle,</hi> however it be handled. Moreover the vital Conſtitution is a thing tranſient and conſiſteth (as the Phyloſophers Phraſ is) <hi>in motu &amp; fieri;</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is rooted. In the movable and decaying Spirits (ſuch as the Vitals which are contained in the Arteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Blood) for ſom Member being cut off, the Life vaniſheth almoſt in a moment, and by Conſequence the vital conſtitution: but the natural (as we have already inſinuated) continueth (though not in ſuch an exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as when the Vital remaineth) for a while after death. And indeed the Life and the Vital conſtitution is ſuddenly taken away in the caſe aforeſaid not by any
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:169706:44"/>
poſitive contrary Cauſe, But by a meer privation of the Conſervant and Continent CAUSE. This is moſt evidently confirmed, becauſe the Vital conſtitution is ſuddenly intended, remitted and altered in al the parts in reſpect of the model or meaſure of the Vital Conſtitution, excited in the <hi>Ventricles</hi> of the Heart, ſo in a <hi>Lipothymy,</hi> the heart fainting, the life of the parts preſently vaniſheth, at laſt languiſheth; but aſſoon as the <hi>Ventricles</hi> of the heart are refreſhed with Spirits by ſome proper cordial applications, ſtraight way we behold the vital Conſtitution to be ſuddenly in ſome meaſure repaired in all the Parts. In the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the breath ſudden death followeth the torrent of the vital Blood from the right to the left <hi>Ventricle</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intercepted. In the opening of a Vein or in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other immoderate profuſion of Blood there happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a ſwouning by the ſole defect of the Vital Spirits. Therefore ſeing the Vital conſtitution is tranſient and fugitive in any of the ſolid parts, and ſeing it dependeth upon the proportion of the vital ſpirits flowing into them from the <hi>Ventricle</hi> of the heart, we may right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infer that in the ſolid parts, it is not original but participative. But in the Vital Spirits themſelves, by whoſe function the Vital conſtitution is diffuſed and tranſmitted into all the Parts, it muſt neceſſarily be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal: For there is no other original ſubject of it to be found in the Body.</p>
            <p>Yet we grant that the ſolid ſubſtance of the heart by his Natural Conſtitution (eſpecially being watred by the Vital) is the aſſiſtant cauſ of the excitation of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Spirits in the blood included their <hi>Ventricles,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it cannot be the firſt ſubject of that ſame Vital Conſtitution, as we have even now abundantly proved. And theſe things for the preſent may ſuffice in general
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:169706:44"/>
concerning each vital conſtitution, the original and the participative, and to prov that that muſt properly be aſcribed to the Vital Spirits, this to the ſolid Parts as the immediate Subjects of the inherence. Three kind of vices belonging to this Conſtitution do ſtil await our examination: The two former wherof relate to the Original: And the third pertaineth to the participative Conſtitution. The firſt vice concerneth the Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Vital Spirits. The ſecond hath reference to the diſtribution of them: And the third appertaineth to the participation of the Vital Conſtitution. Of theſe we ſhal make enquiry in their order.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IX. The vitiated Generation of the <hi>Vital Spirits</hi> in this Affect, and whether that fault be a Part of that Secondary Eſſence?</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Vital Spirits</hi> are firſt excited or generated within the Ventricles of the Heart; namely, in the very maſs of the Blood, and properly they diſcriminate the Blood in the Arteries, from that in the veyns, after that they are generated they are cheriſhed and conſerved within the cavities of the Arteries, until they are diſtributed into the habit of the Parts. Yea, they are not only cheriſhed in the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but in them alſo rightly diſpoſed, perhaps ſom new ones are excited, though with leſs efficacy then in the heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This being Preadmoniſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſay firſt, That in the very Subſtance of the heart
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:169706:45"/>
there doth not occur any fault repugnant to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Vital Spirits,</hi> which properly can be a part, even of the ſecondary Eſſence of this Diſeaſ. For the heart it ſelf, for his doth rightly perform his func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this Diſeaſ: and if any imperfection happen in the Generation of the <hi>Vital Spirits,</hi> it cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly aſcribed to the heart, but to the ineptitude of the matter, to receive the form of the <hi>Vital Spirits.</hi> As the ingeſted aliment if it be extreamly crude, it may fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the perfection of a laudable concoction, the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach being otherwiſe ſound and faultleſs: So the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt and unprofitable blood exported to the ventricles of the Heart, may render the action therof imperfect, in reſpect of the operation and effect, how ſound ſoever it may be in it ſelf: In which caſe the aſcription of the fault is uſually and truly attributed to the indiſpoſed matter, and not to the Heart. You wil reply, a Feaver is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times complicated with this affect, and at ſuch time the heart doth unaptly Generate the <hi>Vital Spirits,</hi> But that Feaver is a Diſeaſ of a different kind, and by no means either the whol or any Part of the Eſſence of this affect.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We affirm that the leſſer Arteries inſerted into the firſt affected Parts, are in ſome degree really cooled and benummed by them, through their adjacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and contact, and for that cauſ they do unaptly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv the <hi>Vital Spirits</hi> contained in them, wherupon the Vital Conſtitution of them is rendred ſomwhat imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, before they can be effuſed into the Parts themſelvs. And this fault of the little Arteries ſeemeth by very good right to be aſcribed to the Generation of the <hi>vital Spirits.</hi> For although it be not the function of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries to propogate the <hi>Vital Spirits</hi> according to the firſt ſignification of the word; yet for this very reaſon,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:169706:45"/>
that they are obliged to conſerv them when they are propagated, namly by ſuch a conſervation as in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner includeth a certain continuate <hi>Generation</hi> of them, their faults are rightly to be referred to the <hi>Generation</hi> of the <hi>Vital Spirits.</hi> For the Vital Conſtitution is a certain tranſient action (as we have ſhewed before) which, while it laſteth, is in a continual flux and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and which like a flame, when the continual fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and reparation of it is ſuſpended and ſuppreſſed, ſuddenly extinguiſhed. Therfore are the <hi>Arteries</hi> as a continuate Heart to all the parts of the body, unto which they tranſmit and powr out their contained Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; and what faults ſoever of the Spirits happen before the effuſion of them into the habit of the Parts, ſeing that they neceſſarily belong to the Original Vital Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and cannot otherwiſe be aſcribed to the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the Spirits, they muſt be referred to the very Generation of them; namely, a continuate Generation in the Arteries, wherby they are continually preſerved from a ſudden extinction.</p>
            <p>Moreover, This fault of the Vital Spirits is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation of the Vital and Original Conſtitution, and ſeing that it is ſomwhat preternatural, firſt hurting the action, from whence the participative conſtitution, flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth in like manner depraved, and ſeing that it meerly dependeth upon the primary Eſſence aforeſaid and is complicated in the ſame parts, it will be a part of the ſecondary Eſſence of this Diſeaſ.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We ſay that the matter of the Vital Spirits, to wit the Blood of the Veins impregnated with his Natural ſpirits returning in his circulation from the firſt affected parts towards the Heart, is ſomwhat diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by them to admit the form of the Vital Spirit. For it is neceſſary that the Blood, whilſt it paſſeth
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:169706:46"/>
through the parts affected with a cold diſtemper, want and benummedneſs of inherent Spirits, muſt alſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon affected with ſome kind of frigidity, benummed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and perhaps with a thickneſs and viſcous quality beyond the uſual degree of Nature. For as the blood doth give a tincture of his qualities to the parts tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row which it glideth; So on the contrary, the parts themſelves bequeath alſo as much as they can of their qualities to the flowing blood. But here likewiſe we muſt grant withal that this indiſpoſition in the parts firſt affected (eſpecially when it is light and ſmal) in the return to the inward parts, is very much corrected by their heat, before it ariſeth at the <hi>Ventricles</hi> of the heart, nay that it is ſomtimes ſubdued or if any ſuch contracted fault remain, it is commonly totally aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the length of the journy before the return of the Blood to the left <hi>Ventricle</hi> of the heart, whilſt it floweth down by the right, and the ſubſtance of the Lungs, the ſame thing alſo may be thus confirmed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſ if that indiſpoſition ſhould continue till the return of the blood to the left Ventricle of the Heart, the whol maſs of blood in the Arteries would become crude and imperfect; and ſeing that this blood thus abounding with imperfect Vital Spirits ſhould be tranſmitted from the <hi>Aorta</hi> to al the Parts, it would more or leſs affect them al; which very rarely is obſerved in this Diſeaſ. For the head, &amp; many bowels, however ſom of them are found to be greater then ordinary yet they ſeem to be watered with a perfect Vital Spirit. But although, as we have ſaid, the ſlight indiſpoſition of the Blood may be corrected, before its return to the right ventricle, yet when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted fault is great and more conſiderable, it cannot be altogether overcome, wherupon the Lungs in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſ are commonly afflicted with the moſt grievous E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:169706:46"/>
For, when the leſs Spiritous, and therefore the leſs paſſable Blood, is continually tranſmitted thorow the Lungs, cold and thick, or viſcous, in proceſs of time it muſt needs more or leſs infect and obſtruct the weaker parts of the Lungs; from whence proceed difficulty of drawing breath, a ſtubborn cough, hard tumors, inflammations, impoſtumes, and the <hi>Ptyſick.</hi> Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers alſo both <hi>Erratick</hi> and <hi>Hectick,</hi> may from hence di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their Origen. But ſeing that fault may be ſuddenly introduced from the firſt affected parts, it is credible (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we have ſaid the Lungs are often infected by it) that it is for the moſt part overcome, before the Blood can com to the left Ventricle. And this may be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Head and the adjacent parts do look ſo well and flouriſhing, namely, becauſ neither the Natural nor the Vital Conſtitution is hurt in them, ſeing that the perfect Vital Spirits generated in the left Ventricle, and diſtributed from thence, do excite that freſh color in the face; when on the contrary the Lungs do oftentimes la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor under the faults aforeſaid, the viciouſneſs of the Blood not being corrected before it enter the right Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle and the Arterious vein.</p>
            <p>Moreover, This imperfect production of Vital Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in the right Ventricle of the Heart, by reaſon of the crudeneſs of the affluent Blood, flowing in the Veins, totally appertaineth to the ſecondary Eſſence of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſ, and muſt be accounted a part of it: for the Vital Conſtitution is vitiated, wherupon the actions in the Lungs are depraved, and it dependeth wholy and in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reſpect upon the primary granted Eſſence, neither in the mean time, doth it reſide in the ſolid Subſtance of the Heart, that it ſhould therfore deſerv the name of a a new diſeaſ.</p>
            <p>Here we note by the way, That Phyſitians in the cure
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:169706:47"/>
of this affect do ever intermingle ſuch things with their remedies as have reſpect to the benefit of the Lungs; and not without reaſon, ſeing that it is apparent by what hath been ſaid, to how much danger that Bowel is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſubject. And this may ſuffice concerning the faults in the Generation of the Vital Spirits: Now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the faults of the diſtribution of thoſe Spirits.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His vitiated diſtribution ſeemeth to conſiſt in three things: Namly, in the Dimunition, Slowneſs, and the Inequality of it. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, and alſo the ſlow diſtribution of the Blood and Spirits, may be ſeen in ſome one Part, and perhaps in all thoſe that are firſt affected: But the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality cannot be obſerved in any one, ſeing that it reſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth from a collation of a various ſwiftneſs and ſlowneſs, greatneſs and ſmalneſs of the torrent of the Blood in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the other parts. The defect and ſlowneſs of the diſtribution: ſeing that they depend almoſt upon the ſame cauſes in the preſent affect, they may be handled together, and ſeing thoſe differences are more ſimple then the inequality, the handling of them ſeemeth deſervedly and juſtly to be premiſed.</p>
            <p>But firſt we muſt grant that the paſſages and circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:169706:47"/>
of the Blood, thorow the firſt affected parts is not very difficult in this affect. For although a cold diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, a want and benummedneſs of Spirits, do ſeem very difficultly to admit a tranſition of the Blood thorow the parts affected, with theſe qualities; yet indeed other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned qualities; as moyſture, looſneſs, laxity, flaccidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſoftneſs, and internal lubricity, can at the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute as much power to facilitate the paſſage of it, as the qualities aforeſaid can oppoſe to the interruption of it. Yea, if you valu them by a juſt eſtimation, perhaps they can do more, but we wil not in this place aſſert it, only we flatly deny the difficulty of the circulation to be greater. For, if we may compare hard bodies with ſoft, low bodies with ſtraight, moiſt with dry, ſlippery with rough, we ſhal eaſily perceiv that the circulation of the blood is much more quick and expedite in thoſe, then in theſe. And this is manifeſt in young Creatures in whom thoſe qualities abound, in ſuch as are new born, although the Heart be very tender, the Arteries leſs firm, the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſificative vertu, yet feeble and weak, yet the paſſing too and fro of the blood are readily and eaſily exerciſed; which in thoſe that are older is not accompliſhed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſtronger pulſe, and an indeavor or a kind of labor of the Heart and Arteries. Again, according to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> the Bodies of children are moſt paſſible; namly, by reaſon of their humidity, laxity, and ſoftneſs. Beſides, if we obſerv the formation of the chicken in the eg, the matter wil be yet more plain. Within few days after the incubation the Heart of the chicken is ſenſibly and evidently ſeen to beat, and to begin the circulation of the Blood: but if at the ſame time we conſider the frailty of the Heart it ſelf, and how weak a coherence there is between the parts of it, til in the interim it finiſheth the circulation of the blood ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:169706:48"/>
to the manner of it, ſuch as it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily grant that in that ſhapeleſs lump, moiſture, and internal lubricity do expediate and facilitate that motion. Some perhaps may object that in theſe cited caſes the liberty and readineſs of the circulation of the blood, depends not ſo much upon the moiſture, ſoftneſs and ſlipperineſs, as upon the plenty of the inherent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Spirits. For in the <hi>Cachexia,</hi> Green ſickneſs, and the dropſy, the fleſh is very ſoft, moiſt; and perhaps ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, when in the mean time the tranſition of the Blood is very difficult. We anſwer, thoſe Bodies that wax tender and ſoft by a paucity of inherent Spirits, are leſs indiſpoſed, and more apt to admit the circulation of the Blood then the other parts. But it is not ſimply tru that ſuch bodies which moſt abound with Spirits do perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually obtain the moſt expedite and unreſtrained circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Blood: for the Blood is more eaſily circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in Fiſh, then in Creatures of the Land, as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by the tender and frail Conſtitution of their Heart, and Arteries; yet they enjoy a leſs quantity of Inherent Spirits. But becauſe they live perpetually in the waters, therfore is their fleſh more moiſt and ſlippery. Whence it moſt evidently appeareth how effectual the inward lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricity and moiſture are to facilitate the paſſage of the Blood. As for thoſe that are invaded with the Green ſickneſs or afflicted with a <hi>Cachexia,</hi> we grant indeed that the circulation of the Blood is difficult in them, yet not only through a defect of inherent Spirits, but by reaſon of ſtubborn obſtructions lodging in the whol bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Wherefore it muſt be granted, notwithſtanding the cold diſtemper, the penury, and ſtupefaction of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which procure a difficulty to the circulation, that ſuch a Mediocrity is impoſed upon it, by the moiſture, ſoftneſs, and internal ſlipperineſs, that the paſſage of the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:169706:48"/>
Blood may be reduced to a juſt, if not an extream faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. But if the moiſture, ſoftneſs, and inward ſlippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs be ſo conſiderable to effectuate an eaſie circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Blood, Truly, the diſtribution of it through the parts firſt affected ſeemeth to be expected more ſwift and not more ſlow. We anſwer that the facility of the tranſition of the Blood is oppoſed to the ſlowneſs of the motion, or to the ſmalneſs of the paſſage. For a ſwift motion may be ſlow, and in a ſmal Channel. But the facility is here oppoſed to difficulty, ſtriving, and labor, which in this caſe, if the circulation were diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, ſhould happen to the Artery in the paſſage of the Blood. But that the Arteries do undergo ſome labor in expediting the circulation of the Blood into the firſt affected parts, ſhall anon be demonſtrated; we only affirm in this place that the facility, of the paſſage of the Blood doth not ſufficiently argue either the ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the motion, nor the widneſs of the paſſage. For, two cauſes do chiefly conſpire to haſten the courſe of the Blood through the habit of the parts. One is the aptitude of the part recipient, or that through which the blood ought to flow; and this cauſe is meerly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and ſlothful: the other is the impulſion of the Heart and Artery, and alſo of the Arterious Blood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to ſtretch and dilate it ſelf. This cauſe is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and full of vivacity. For upon the ceſſation of this impulſion, the diſtribution of the Blood will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after totally ceaſe, however the paſſage may be otherwiſe ſuppoſed to be moſt eaſie, manifeſt therfore it is that this impulſion is the principal &amp; active cauſe of the ſwiftnes and ſlownes, and alſo of the quantity of the diſtribution of the Blood. Wherfore thoſe cauſes which do any way advance or hinder this impulſion, do now come to undergo a more accurate examination.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:169706:49"/>
For by theſe we ſhall know whether the deſtribution of the Blood in the parts firſt affected, be really more ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or ſlow than is meet.</p>
            <p>Theſe cauſes do chiefly concur to excite that impulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Firſt, the plenty and activity of the Vital ſpirits contained in the Blood. Secondly, the perfect ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Heart. Thirdly, The firmitude, heat, and juſt magnitude of the Arteries. Fourthly, An irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both of the Heart and Arteries, whether extrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally or intrinſecally cauſed. Theſe we will run over in their order, that it may appear in what condition they are in this preſent Diſeaſ. Firſt, As for the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and activity of the Vital Spirits, we have already ſhewed that in this affect the imperfect Vital Spirits are frequently excited in the right Ventricle of the Heart. Seing therefore that the Blood tainted with theſe imperfect Spirits, muſt be driven into the Lungs, there is a neceſſity the deſtribution muſt there become more ſparing and ſlow by reaſon of the defect of the Spirits. Again, ſeeing that the vital blood, as we have alſo ſhewed above, is ſomwhat cooled in the Arteries, which are terminated in the firſt affected parts, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary likewiſe that the paſſage of it through the ſaid parts muſt be diminiſhed and more dull.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The vertue of the Heart, unleſs peradventure by accident through the complication of ſome other Diſeaſ, is ſeldom ſeen to be viciated in this affect.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, For ſo much as concerneth the Arteries, we cannot accuſe their condition of any notable defect in reference to their ſtrength. But there is a manifeſt fault both in their heat and magnitude. Firſt, in their heat, the Arteries inſerted into the firſt affected parts, muſt neceſſarily by their cold diſtemper be ſomwhat af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the like diſtemper. For ſeing that a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:169706:49"/>
of the parts firſt affected is active and permanent, it is unavoidable but they muſt more or leſs introduce a like quality into the parts ſo neerly bordering to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, For natural agents are buſily induſtrious to aſſimilate all Bodies placcd within the Sphear of their activity, but eſpecially ſuch as are circumambient and neerly adjacent. But if any man doubt whether that coldneſs of the Arteries can retard and leſſen the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the Blood through the firſt affected parts, let him conſider that frigidity is of it ſelf an enemy to any kind of motion. For it is the quality of cold by its own Nature to arreſt Violences, and impetuous oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, to condenſate, to induce ſloth, to ſuperinduce <hi>Somnolency,</hi> ſtupefaction, and immobility, and when it attaineth a more intenſive degree, to congeal and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the parts. Therfore it muſt needs caſt a <hi>Remora</hi> to the torrent or the Blood waving through the parts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with that quality. Beſides, In the opening of a Vein we have often obſerved upon the cooling of the member that the Blood hath flowed more ſlowly and ſparingly, and if the member be warmed again, or the pulſe be excited by rubbing or any other motion or means, that then the Blood floweth again with a more plentiful and liberal current. Moreover, the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of cold things is ſenſibly effectual to ſtop Blood pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternaturally burſting out of any part, as on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, hot things do provoke the ebullition of it.</p>
            <p>It may be objected, <hi>That the Pulſe is many times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuated and intended by the cold outwardly oppoſed; as by the handling and playing with ſnow, we ſee that not only the Pulſe but the heat alſo is augmented in the hands of thoſe that ſport themſelves with it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We anſwer, Cold things of themſelves do alwaies move the paſſage of the Blood through the habit of the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:169706:50"/>
parts; but that by accident they may intend the circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood, if at length they provoke the pulſes of the Arteries (as in the ſaid caſe of the ſnow it happneth) to beat ſtronger marches. But this never comes to paſs in this preſent affect. For (as we have already ſhewed) the circulation of the Blood in this Diſeaſ, however it may ſuffer <hi>Immunitior</hi> or <hi>Retardation,</hi> yet it continueth ſufficiently eaſy and expedite, neither doth any irritati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the pulſ ariſe from thence, as anon we ſhal perceiv more plainly. For ſeing it is manifeſt by what hath been ſaid, that the Arteries reaching to the firſt affected parts, become more cold then ordinary, or is meet, we may eaſily beleev that they become likewiſe more ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; ſo in any cooled member we ſee the Veins and the Arteries become more ſlender then they were wont to be; and it cannot be denyed, but that actual cold doth ſtraighten the Veſſels. But it is more then probable that a Potential coldneſs (ſuch as perhaps that may be ſaid to be which is of an inward diſtemper) doth likewiſe make the Veins and Arteries more ſlender. So we ſee cold Complexions, and alſo cold and moiſt, to have leſs Veins and Arteries then the hot. Corpulent bodies, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, children, have narrower Veſſels, then lean, men, or youths. Beſides, the very heat it ſelf is an expanſive quality, that it may enlarge the Veſſels, and cold a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive quality, that it may reſtrain and ſtraiten the Veſſels. Finally, one of us obſerved that upon the diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Bodies periſhing by this affect: He hath ſomtimes found the Veins, and the Arteries, tending to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the firſt affected parts to be of an undue ſlender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: but that thoſe Arteries called <hi>Carotides,</hi> and the <hi>Iugulary</hi> Veins were diſproportinatly amplified; and in is credible that this might have been perpetually obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, had they that opened the bodies minded it with a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:169706:50"/>
attentive contemplation. But this we peremptorily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm not, but leave it to future inquiry: in the interim ſeing that it ſufficiently appeareth by what hath been ſaid that the circulation of the Blood, in the firſt affected parts is diminiſhed, it is likewiſe agreable to reaſon, that the Veſſels alſo of thoſe parts are ſtraitned. And ſeing that the left Ventricle of the Heart, doth pour ſo great a quantity into the <hi>Aorta</hi> as may ſuffice al the parts, and ſeing that ſo many parts primarily affected do ſparingly ſip, that blood it is very probable that it is diſtributed with an unuſual liberality thorow the other parts, and namly thorow the Head and Liver, and therefore the Veſſels of theſe parts are ſomwhat dilated and amplified. Concerning the leſned circulation of the Blood in this affect: We ad this experiment only, a ligature being wound about the arm or thighs of a yong boy grievouſly tormented with this Diſeaſ, the Veins did not ſo eaſily ſwel beyond the ligature, neither did the habit of the part ful of Blood appear in that place ſo ſwell'd and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lored as it uſually doth in thoſe that are ſound. From whence apparent it is, that the tranſition of the Blood thorow thoſe parts is more dul and leſs plentiful, then it ought to be as a river ſtopped by a dam or wal doth ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or later overflow the Banks, according to the various ſwiftneſs and magnitude of the Torrent: So likewiſe it happneth here, the retiring of the Blood thorow the Vein, to the inward parts, is intercepted by the force of the ligature, which if it were violent, would in a ſhort time fil the Veins, and the habit of the parts beyond the ligature; as we ſee it to happen otherwiſe in ſound Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; but becauſe in this Diſeaſ it filleth them ſlowly, and very dully, we muſt conclude that the circulation of the Blood in thoſe parts is extreamly leſſened and ſlow, and that the Arteries inſerted into thoſe parts are more
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:169706:51"/>
cold and ſlender then they ought to be, as we have moſt abundantly proved, that the Arteries of the firſt affected parts are vitiated by a defect of juſt magnitude.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, As for the irritation of the Heart and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries (which perhaps is the principle cauſ of many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in the pulſes) it is manifeſtly found to be weak and ineffectual in the Arteries of the firſt affected parts. We purpoſe not at this time to diſcourſe of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, cauſes, differences and effects of irritation in the pulſes; only we obſerv in general that it may be either natural or violent; and that each of them may be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal or particular, and withal may ariſe either from within or from without. And laſtly, that it may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive or defective: In the handling of the preſent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſ it wil ſuffice to touch upon the particular Irritation of the Arteries, and afterwards to accommodate our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes to the preſent buſineſs. 1. Therfore, we affirm that the Arteries impel the Blood into the ſubſtance or habit of the parts, by a certain labor and contention; and that the parts which receiv that Blood do make ſom reſiſtance and oppoſition: that by reaſon of this conflict the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries are Irritated to make ſtronger reſiſtances or pulſes; and that that Skirmiſhing is of ſo great moment to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the pulſe and render it more vigorous, that when it is weak, the Pulſ can ſcarce be ſtrong: but where the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is ſomwhat more increaſed, yet ſo, that it doth not overcome the oppoſition of the Arteries, the pulſe becomes more ſtrong and lively, provided that no impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment from ſom other cauſ doth intervene. This we might illuſtrate by divers inſtances, but we wil exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy it only in a few: in the winter the pulſes are more ful, hard, ſtrong and conſtant, then in the ſummer; but it is certain that at that time the outward parts of the body being bound up with cold, are more firm and leſs
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:169706:51"/>
paſſable, and therfore that they do more ſtrongly then at other times reſiſt the Blood, contending to paſs thorow the ſubſtance of them in his circulation; wherupon the Arteries, when no other intervening matter hindreth, muſt needs move more vigorouſly, and drive the Blood more forcibly, if they perform their office in perfecting the circulation of the Blood. Hereupon thoſe Arteries are irritated, unleſs they be totally ſuppreſt, or by ſome other means charmed, and by degrees yeeld ſtronger ſtrokes; and withal the Spiritous Blood being pent in &amp; ſtriving for more room they do wax a little more hot, and are ſomwhat enlarged, and ſomtimes having a little triumphed over the ſubdued oppoſition, they drive for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the blood into the parts, with a more ſwift &amp; copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous torrent then before. This is further confirmed by the heat augmented by handling ſnow, for although at the firſt the Hands wax preſently cold, yet in a ſhort time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they grow hot, &amp; withal they are died &amp; colored with Blood, as the intenſiveneſs of the heat doth juſtify. For upon the firſt contrectation or touch of the ſnow the parts are bound up, and ſtrongly reſiſt the circulation of the Blood, the Arteries alſo in thoſe parts are at the ſame time contracted But, unleſs the cold prevail to a total ſuppreſſion of the Spirits contained in thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and to a ſtupifying of the Arteries themſelvs, or at leaſt a benummedneſs, thoſe Arteries are by degrees irritated, and the interrupted Blood more forcibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for wider room, and ſo at length by this counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oppoſition, the Arteries wax hot and are dilated, and the pulſ being increaſed, they extrude the Blood more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully into the part before overcooled. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in the ſummer, when leſs reſiſtance is oppoſed againſt the paſſage of the Blood, the pulſe becomes more feeble, more languid, and more ſoft. From whence it appears
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:169706:52"/>
that the defect of a du irritation, proceeding from the weak reſiſtance of the parts which receav the Blood from the Arteries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth diminiſh the vigor of the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſame is yet more evidently ſeen when the Pulſe is augmented by the motion of the Body; for in any violent motion almoſt all the Muſcles are ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, by reaſon wherof they ſomwhat more reſiſt the paſſage of the Blood; hereupon the Arteries are provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to contention, their heat is encreaſed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more nimble, ſtrong and full Pulſes are emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As the inflamation of a part doth ſenſibly irritate the Arteries thereof, ſo it exciteth a more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement Pulſe and bauſeth a more liberal Flux of the Blood. The ſame may be ſaid of pain.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Hither alſo muſt be referred the bruiſing of any part. For a bruiſed part doth difficultly receive the Blood flowing to it: hereupon the Arteries provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, they beat more ſtrongly, and ſwell the bruiſed part reſiſting them into a tumor. This might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtred by many more examples, but we conceive theſe to be very ſufficient and ſatisfactory.</p>
            <p>Moreover, It muſt be noted that the parts cauſed by the reception of the Blood in the Arteries, may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great, and yet not ſufficient effectually to irritate the Arteries; in which caſe it rather remitteth and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbeth them, encreaſeth, or facilitateth the force of the torrent of the Blood. For that oppoſition of it ſelf interrupteth the channel of the Blood thorow the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the parts; but becauſ it doth withal irritate the Arteries to emit more lively ſtrokes, it quickneth the torrent of it by accident. Wherfore we are here compelled into another involuntary digreſſion, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:169706:52"/>
between the reſiſtance of the part that irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, and that which doth not, or doth very little irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the inſtances already alledged will ſuffice for the former, and to explain the latter we will ad a few.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Therefore there is a reſiſtance that totally ſuppreſſeth the torrent of the Blood. Such a one is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by a ſtrong ligature, which doth altogether inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the pulſe in thoſe parts beyond it, neither yet doth it irritate the Arteries on this ſide of it, becauſe it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercometh all the force of the Artery beyond the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and doth wholly break off the action thereof. The ſame is ſeen in the parts mortified with cold, or by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſes corrupted with an inflamation; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in ſome hard ſwellings, contractures and ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed wounds.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is a reſiſtance preſſing down the Arteries even by the compreſſion of the Arteries, and this happeneth in a ligature indifferently bound. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the compreſſion of an Artery by ſome tumor in the adjacent parts as in a raw ſwelling; alſo in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion from any outward cauſe, many things which belong to the lying down on the right ſide eſpecially, and the left are referred hither; ſo in tumors on the right ſide, the lying on the left ſide is many times endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the leaſt patience by the compreſſion of the ſound parts by thoſe that are ſwelled &amp;c. and this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion however it reſiſteth the circulation of the Blood, yet it doth not ſeem much to irritate the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, becauſe it doth no leſs intercept the very pulſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive force, then it diminiſheth the action thereof. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though perhaps it may ſomtimes irritate in the Lungs by reaſon of their vehement heat, juſt as it uſeth to do in aching and inflamed parts.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is a reſiſtance in part repreſſing the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:169706:53"/>
circulation of the Blood, but without compreſſion of the Arteries, nor yet totally ſuppreſſing them, nor very much irritating the Artery. Such an one occurreth in obſtructions cauſed by cold, ſlow, thick, and moiſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, which although they may ſomwhat retard the free paſſage of the Blood, yet they provoke the Artery very little, becauſe at the ſame time they ſuperinduce a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain benummedneſs in them, at leaſt a cold diſtemper, as alſo in the Blood which they contain. The ſame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt may be ſaid of paralytical members, but that in theſe a benummedneſs is more evidently introduced in their Arteries, and the channel of the Blood is leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded in them,</p>
            <p>Moreover, We affirm ſecondly that the parts firſt affected in this Diſeaſ do not ſufficiently irritate the Arteries, by which the Blood is diſtributed through them. For although in theſe parts, both by reaſon of their ſolidity, and alſo in reſpect of their coldneſs, we grant ſome kind of reſiſtance, yet it is extream feeble and ſlow, and very little provoking. Firſt, becauſe in thoſe paris a moiſt is conjoyned with the cold diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which of it ſelf tempereth and qualifieth all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of provocations. Secondly, Becauſ there is a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury of inherent Spirits, which otherwiſe, where they abound, are wont to cheriſh the vigor of the Arteries, and the blood contained in them. Thirdly, Becauſe thoſe parts are looſ, weak, and ſoft, and therfore more prone to receive with facility that which the Arteries ſend in, than to exaſperate them by reſiſtance. And that the Arteries do not conveigh the Blood by any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and conſiderable force into theſe parts, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by this ſign, becauſ after the influx of the Spirits, and the Blood they ſtill continue looſ, ſoft and feeble, when on the contrary ſtrong Pulſes are wont to render
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:169706:53"/>
the parts otherwiſe weak, ful, ſwoln, and ſtiff, on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Fifthly, becauſ the firſt affected parts have in them a ſimilary lubricity. For as the ſuperficiary or external lubricity ſuffereth any thing to paſs by, without attriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſo alſo the Internal or ſimilary lubricity facilitates the circulation of the Blood, ſo that the paſſage is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed with very ſmal oppoſition. We conclude therfore that the proirritation of the Arteries is in this Diſeaſ deficient; and therfore that the Arteries are very dully and ineffectually excited to ſtrengthen the pulſ.</p>
            <p>Having at the length weighed al things which we propounded concerning the cauſes which actuate and advance the Blood in his circulation, it ſufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that the circulation of the Blood in this affect is eaſy and expedit enough, but that it is leſſened and paſſeth dully thorow the parts firſt affected, both by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſluggiſhneſs of the Arterious Blood contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Artery of the ſaid parts, and alſo becauſ of the defective heat, and ſlenderneſs of thoſe Arteries; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, in regard of their ineffectual irritation. And let theſe things ſuffice concerning the two former faults belonging to the diſtribution of the Blood in this affect, namly, the diminution and ſlowneſs therof. It remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the next place to examine the inequality of that diſtribution.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XI. The Inequality of the Diſtribution of the Blood in this Affect.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His inequality is to be eſtimated by a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the greatnes &amp; ſwiftneſs of the current of the Blood, made in divers parts. For if the circulation of the Blood according to a Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical proportion be either equally ſmal and ſlow, or equally great and ſwift, that muſt be judged equal by the ſcope of the preſent enquiries: on the contrary, if in ſome parts it be little and ſlow, and in others great and ſwift, that muſt be reputed unequal and diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate. And this is the State of the preſent diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
            <p>It is manifeſt by what hath been ſaid, That the ſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood thorow the parts firſt affected, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ſparing and ſlow: It remaineth therfore only that we conſider whether it be tranſmitted thorow the other parts with a quicker and more plentifull motion.</p>
            <p>We have already affirmed that the root of this evil is not fixed in the Heart it ſelf, and that this Bowel of it ſelf is not primarily il affected in reſpect of the left Ventricle therof. It is credible therefore, that the Heart (unleſs perhaps ſom other Diſeaſ be conjoyned or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervene) doth rightly execute his function, and expel a ſufficient quantity of Blood, for our turn by every ſtroke into the <hi>Aorta.</hi> Seing therfore (as hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:169706:54"/>
proved) that the Blood is niggardly diſpenſed from the <hi>Aorta</hi> into the firſt affected parts, a ſuperfluous por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it muſt needs be diſtributed into other parts not ſo affected: for otherwiſe the <hi>Aorta</hi> ſhould not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently diſcharge it ſelf, nor disburthen the Blood received from the Heart, but it would be obſtructed and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the plenty therof; and this repletion upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſlight occaſion would fly back, even to the left Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of the Heart, and there kindle a Feaver. And we grant indeed, for this very cauſ, among others, that in this Diſeaſ a Feaver is eaſily and frequently produced. But ſeing that the Feaver is another Diſeaſ conjoyned, and ſeparable and different from this, and ſeing that this Diſeaſ very often happneth without a Feaver; it muſt needs be granted, that by how much more ſparingly the Blood is diſtributed to the firſt affected parts, by ſo much the more plentifully conv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed to the other parts, at leaſt in the abſence of the Feaver. For ſeing that quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Blood, as we ſaid even now, is extruded into the <hi>Aorta,</hi> as may ſuffice the whole Body, and ſeing al of it muſt be diſtributed into ſeveral parts, it moſt plainly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that the leſs is tranſmitted into one part, the more is diſpenſed into another. And thus it may be perceived that the inequality of the diſtribution of the Blood is inferred from the ſole diminution thereof, in the firſt affected parts above aſſerted, (at leaſt probably) namly, from the ſmal and ſlow current of the Blood thorow the parts firſt affected, there may be rightly collected à more quick and plentiful ſtream of it, into the inward parts not ſo affected. Now let us ſee whether the other appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances relating hither are correſpondent to this Diſcourſ.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It ſeemeth manifeſt by what hath been alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Head, the Brain, the Liver, and the other Bowels, are not afflicted with that cold diſtemper, nor
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:169706:55"/>
that ſtupefaction and penury of inherent Spirits, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the parts primarily affected are oppreſt. For the bowels and the ſaid parts do not receive their Nerves from the Spinal Marrow, without the Skul, but they are involved in the ſame condition with the other parts. Moreover, thoſe parts, as far as we can judg by the touch are (at leaſt outwardly) moderatly hot, and as far as we can gueſs by the ſight they retain their native and flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing color, beſides they are more ful and fleſhly, then the firſt affected parts.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Children afflicted with this Diſeaſ have an indifferently good appetite, they do not il concoct the introſumed aliment, and about the Head they retain their ſenſes very acute: they ſee, they hear, they taſt, they ſmel as ſubtily as others, and as for their wit, they many times ſurpaſs thoſe of equal years with them; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs an impediment from ſome other cauſ. All which things put together do abundantly witneſs, that a cold diſtemper, nor a benummedneſs or penury of Inherent Spirits, hath none, or at leaſt a very ſmal predominancy in thoſe parts. Theſe things being granted, we muſt likewiſe needs grant that a more liberal diſtribution of the Blood is diſpenſed to the ſaid parts. For as for the heat, we have already ſhewed that that doth both am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plify and ſtir up the Arteries to ſend forth a ſtronger pulſation; and we have alſo noted above that the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Spirits, doth not only cheriſh the pulſificative force of the Arteries, and conſerv the vigor of the Blood contained in them, but that it doth ſomwhat enliven and excitate both of them, and that by ſo much the more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, by how much the leſs the inherent Spirits are affected with a ſtupefaction.</p>
            <p>Secondly, unleſs thoſe parts were watered with a more liberal circulation of the Blood, they would becom more
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:169706:55"/>
ſoft, looſ, and feeble, then they are, even as the parts firſt affected are obſerved to be. For upon the defect or languiſhing of the Pulſ in any part, the part preſently becoms looſ and weak, as it happneth to al the Parts in a <hi>Lipothymy.</hi> On the contrary, when the Pulſ beats ſtrongly, the Part wherunto it belongeth, is ſeen to be ſomwhat rigid and ſwelled. For a ful Pulſ doth preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fil up thoſe parts, which were before ſunk down by emptineſs; as the <hi>Lypothymy</hi> being driven away, and the Pulſ being reſtored, the Parts of the Body, which were before looſ and languid, are not only wel colored, but ful of vivacity and turgid: ſeing therfore that thoſe Parts are not affected with that ſoftneſs, looſneſs, and weakneſs, we muſt conclude that they are actuated with a full Pulſ.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The very augmented magnitude of theſ parts, in compariſon of the parts primarily affected in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſ doth witneſs, that they are more liberally fed with their aliment, namly, the Blood, (which is reputed the common and laſt aliment of the Parts) for otherwiſe ſcarce any ſufficient reaſon can be imagined, why, when the firſt affected Parts are ſo extenuated, theſe ſhould be (eſpecially the Brain and Liver) in ſo good a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſo ful and ſo plump. The ſame thing is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the lively color of the ſame parts. For if the Pulſ languiſh in any part, ſomwhat of the freſh and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable color preſently retireth from that Part.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Arteries called <hi>Carotides,</hi> and the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulary Veyn, which belong to the Brayn, and the parts about the Head, are obſerved to be very broad in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; but the Veſſels tending to the firſt affected parts to be unduly ſlender; from whence we may clearly infer, That the diſpenſation of the Blood to thoſe Parts is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal. And here we intreat and beſeech thoſe who have
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:169706:56"/>
an opportunity to open ſuch Bodies as this affect hath deſtroyed, that they would accurately contemplate whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſwelling Arteries inſerted into the ſwelling parts of the Bones do more liberally, and more commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly tranſmit the Blood into thoſe, than into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leſs nouriſhed parts of the Bones, and whether the Arteries of thoſe parts are more broad than of theſe. Although indeed we confeſs that this enquiry is moſt difficult, both becauſe of the ſlenderneſs of thoſe Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and in regard of the obſcurity of their inſertion, and alſo in reſpect of the hardneſs of the Bones.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Hither alſo belong things hurtful and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for children afflicted with this Diſeaſ are manifeſtly benefitted by rubbings, motion, and various agitation of the Body, by exerciſes, ſtrengthning Oyntments, and the like means which raiſe the heat in the Members on the right-ſide, and the other parts primarily affected, and irritate the Pulſes and augment them after any ſort, whereby the diſtribution of the Blood may be more neerly reduced to ſome equality; with the contrary things they are damnified. In like manner ſuch Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines which promove the diſpenſation of the Blood to the firſt affected parts (as thoſe which are moderately hot, benign and familiar to Nature, and ſo attenuant, incident, and deobſtruent that at the ſame time they do not in the leaſt degree waſt but cheriſh and augment the Spirits) help very much towards the cure of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſ; the contraries do either produce or foment it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing produced. All theſe things being conſidered we muſt conclude that the deſtribution of the Blood in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is irregular and unequal. And thus at length we have finiſhed the diſquification of the faults in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of the Vital Blood; we now proceed to the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:169706:56"/>
examination of the faults, if any ſuch there be, of the Vital participative Conſtitution in this Diſeaſe.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XII. The faults of the Vital participative Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution in this Affect.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have already ſaid that the Origine of the Vital Conſtitution is grounded in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious Blood, and eſpecially in the ſpiritous part thereof: but becauſe the ſolid parts alſo do ſomwhat truly participate the nature of Life we juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſcribe unto them the Vital participative Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Now this Conſtitution conſiſteth in Three Things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In a certain union of the Arterious Blood with the ſubſtance of the ſolid parts through which it paſſeth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In the Vital heat excited in thoſe parts.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In the enlivening and exaltation of the Natural Conſtitution, and of all the Natural faculties of thoſe parts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, As for that union of the Arterious Blood, it muſt be juſtly reputed, the firſt part of the participative Life. For the ſolid parts are therfore ſaid to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of the Nature of Life, or the Vital Conſtitution, becauſe the Vital Spirits are contained in them. For
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:169706:57"/>
Life cannot conſiſt without a Vital Spirit. Therfore when the Vital Spirit is diſtributed in and with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious Blood to the ſolid parts through the Arteries, and theſe parts do ſuck in that Blood into their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, it comes to paſs, that the ſaid parts are couni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Vital Spirits, and ſo they participate of the Nature of Life.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Seeing this union is not permanent but tranſient and conſiſteth in motion, it ſeemeth to conſiſt in the confluence and mutual embracement of the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent natural and influent Vital Spirit: but the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are requiſite to make this a natural concourſe, are,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That it be in all reſpects, moderate, and not impetuous.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That it be in all reſpects ſtrong, and not feeble and ſtupified.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That it be friendly and peaceable, not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile and Turbulent, that it be gentle not tumultuous; that it be neither too ſlippery and ſmooth, nor too rough.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That it end not in any kind of diſſipation of the Spirits, but rather in the appeaſing and apt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of them for their return into the Veins. More ſuch conditions might perhaps be added; but becauſe they very little belong to this Diſeaſ, we ſhall here ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceed any further examination of them. We only note that the mutual concourſe and union of the Vital and natural Conſtitution by their Spirits, doth not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in this affect, with that activity, vigor and compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, as it uſually doth in ſound Bodies. And this ſcarce needeth any proof, ſeeing that it is manifeſt by what hath been ſaid above, that not only the natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the firſt affected Parts doth labor under a
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:169706:57"/>
cold and a moiſt diſtemper, a defect and benummedneſs of Spirits, but that the Vital Blood it ſelf is alſo ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what damped and ſtupified in the tops or ends of the Arteries, before it can be conveighed into the firſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected parts, ſo that that union muſt needs be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med without either a ſufficient vivacity, or pleaſure. For when the vigorous Vital Spirits do meet together with the Natural Spirits no leſs vigorous, they are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited with a kind of curteous ſtrife and delightful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Whether, that we may illuſtrate this matter by an example, the natural Spirits as a Bride do here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure and in a manner repel the Vital Spirits who as it were act the part of a Bridegroom: But the Vital Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits provoked with their heat, and driven on by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor of the Pulſes do more confidently invade the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Spirits and penetrate into their confines and regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whilſt the Natural Spirits in the mean time (however as it were with modeſt reſiſtances repulſing the aſſault) receive them at length not without a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain pleaſure. For the very corporal pleaſure is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed upon, and encreaſed by a kind of amorous ſtrife, and the principal part of Life it ſelf conſiſteth in ſuch a contention about the <hi>Reciprocal</hi> union of the Spirits; for to that end the Vital Spirits are both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> generated and deſtributed, that at length they may paſs through the ſolid Natural Conſtitution of the Parts, and may profoundly imbue them with their vital power and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; but ſeing this peneration cannot be effected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out endeavor and reſiſtance, it muſt needs be, that the vigor of that contention &amp; reſiſtance, be either more or leſs according to their copiouſneſs, vivacity, and heat of thoſe Spirits that maintain the conflict. Therefore becauſe in this affect, both the Natural and the Vital Spirits are more cold, fewer, and leſs active; their
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:169706:58"/>
concourſ and union muſt needs be dull and undelight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Moreover it muſt be noted in this affect (which alſo we have ſhewed above) that the permeation of the Blood thorow the firſt affected parts is to eaſy and ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, wherupon even for this reaſon, that concourſ and union of the Spirits in thoſe parts is rendred more ſlothful, and leſs pleaſant. Beſides, hot exhalations al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though for the moſt part they are ſparingly raiſed in this affect, yet being raiſed, by reaſon of the ſoftneſs, looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and internal lubricity of the firſt affected parts, parts, they evaporate ſooner then is meet, wherupon they leave thoſe parts cold and feeble.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As for the Vital heat communicated to the ſolid parts (which is the ſecond part of the Vital parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipative Conſtitution) that partly depends upon the aforeſaid union, or the Incorporation of the Arterious Blood, with the ſolid parts; but partly it conſiſteth in a certain expanſive motion or endeavor (like to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſive endeavor of the Arterious Blood) excited in the very ſolid parts. The firſt is very perſpicuous, for the Arterious Blood through the impregnation of the Vital heat, when it is receaved into the ſolid parts, muſt needs with their ſubſtance communicate their heat alſo unto them. The ſecond is likewiſe proved without difficulty, For if the Vital heat radicated in the Arterious Blood conſiſteth in a certain motion or endeavor of that Blood uniformly diffuſed and withal at the ſame time ſomwhat reſtrained, it muſt unavoydably excite the ſame motion in the ſolid parts thorow which it paſſeth, ſeing that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural cauſes do always act to the extremity of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and as much as is poſſible by way of aſſimilation. If any man doubt whether the Eſſence of the Vital heat conſiſt in ſuch an uniform diffuſive motion, moderately reſtrained and intrinſically advancing: let him know that
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:169706:58"/>
the Eſſence of heat doth in general conſiſt in motion or a rerefactive endeavor ſomwhat interrupted, as Sr. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Bacon</hi> doth moſt clearly demonſtrate in his <hi>Novum Organum.</hi> But this I ſay, the Vital heat, ſeing that it containeth in it ſelf the tru nature of heat, it wil be alſo neceſſarily ſuch a rarefactive endeavor ſomwhat reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But that this heat may be reſtrained to the Vital; more conditions muſt be added, which nevertheleſs we cannot in this place either reckon up, or accuratly ſearch into, leaſt we ſhould run into an unreaſonable digreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: In the <hi>interim</hi> that we may have the matter, and the manner of enquiring, whether or no in this affect the Vital heat be moderated according to nature, it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good unto us, to propound theſe ſubſequent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the Vital heat may be called Natural, or according to Nature, it is requiſit that the Origin ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be Internal; Namly, in the Arterious Blood, and that it be derived to the ſolid parts, as hath been ſaid, by the implantation and union therof; for that any thing may be called, Natural, it muſt needs flow from an Internal Principle, although it be likewiſe tru that what things ſoever do moderatly cheriſh, augment, and excite that Internal Principle, may in that reſpect deſerve this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is required, that that heat be moderate, not unequally, remiſs, or intenſive, but communicated to the parts, in an even degree.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is required, that it be in ſome meaſure u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niform, and like it ſelf in thoſe parts, that rejoyce in the ſame ſimilary conſtitution, provided, that they be equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtant from the fountain of heat, and after the ſame manner affected by ſome other concurrent and adjacent cauſes. But in the parts further diſtant from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:169706:59"/>
of heat; yet otherwiſe, as hath been ſaid, after the ſame manner affected, that it may be uniformly dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: And in like manner in the colder parts in reſpect of the inherent conſtitution, that it may be alſo propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably more remiſs. Laſtly, In the parts diverſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by other cauſes, ſo that one may be much more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſively hot then another: it is requiſite, that between the hotter and the colder part there be found a heat gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually, and as it were uniformly more remiſs (if you proceed gently from the hotter towards the colder part.) And even a certain uniformity may be obſerved in this deformity or diſparity of heat, ſo long as it continueth within the bounds of Nature. For the parts immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and intermutually touching one another, are in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural capacity, or condition: If one of them be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly hot in compariſon of the other. For ſeing that this Vital heat conſiſteth in a rarefactive endeavor ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what reſtrained, if it be very unequal and diſproportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in the Parts bordering upon one another, it will happen, that that part which endeavoreth with vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, doth withal endeavor to ſeparate it ſelf, from that which uſeth no ſuch vehemence, and ſo that it wil becom a preternatural endeavor, cauſing pain: for pain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in the ſolution of continuity, not yet made, but to be made.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That this heat may not actuate or aſſiſt the action of any other hurtful conjoyned quality whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. For although in this caſe the conjoyned hurtful quality is chiefly peccant, and meriteth the greater part of blame, yet cannot the heat be altogether excuſed. For an acrimonious and malignant heat, denoteth other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to be conjoyned beſides the bare heat, yet the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal heat it ſelf, in as much as it exaſperateth and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the activity of thoſe conjoyned qualities to a more
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:169706:59"/>
potent depravation and annoyance, it muſt be judged partly culpable of their vitious actions.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, On the part of the reſiſtance moderation is alſo required, both in reſpect of the appeaſing of the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritated Vital Spirit, and alſo in regard of the paſſage of the Arterious Blood, and finally in reſpect of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of the unappeaſed exhalations.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, A certain proportion muſt be obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the expanſive endeavor of the Vital heat, and the reſiſtance that reſtrains it, an exceſs therefore in either of them in it ſelf is not a fault, but if one be diſproportionate to another, in that regard it muſt be reputed faulty.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, A certain harmony and order is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both in the endeavor, and in the reſiſtance. For they do not always proceed in one form and continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but as it were fighting, they are ſomtimes intended, ſomtimes remitted. And indeed they are chiefly increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the <hi>Diaſtole</hi> of the Arteries, wher the blood not being contained in his Marrow Veſſels, ſtrugleth for more room, and ſo ſtretcheth the Arteries, til a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent portion of it falleth down, into the habit of the parts, and is there digeſted; for then the place doth not compel the Blood into ſuch ſtraights, but after a ſhort time it deſiſteth from that impetuoſity, and among the cauſes of the pulſation this motion of the Blood is not the leaſt conſiderable. Now that we may apply theſe things to the preſent buſineſs, amongſt all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions now propoſed, the ſecond alone ſeemeth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly to be deſired in this affect. For the Vital heat is not here moderate, but defective and more remiſs than the juſt and Natural Degree. For ſeeing that the firſt affected parts are beſieged with a cold and moiſt diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:169706:60"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:169706:61"/>
and with a penury and benummedneſs of Spirits, they muſt neceſſarily (as we have already demonſtrated) ſomewhat rebate the heat of the Arterious Blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is tranſmitted into the ſubſtance of them; wherupon thoſe parts participate a more remiſs degree of Vital heat, than is due unto them. And this ſhall ſuffice concerning the communication of the Vital hear to the Parts.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As for the laſt part of the participative Life, which indeed dependeth upon the two former, and which is the firſt in the intention, though the laſt in the execution of Nature; we ſay, that it is in ſome ſort the end both of the Original Vital Conſtitution, and alſo of the diſtribution thereof, and finally of the aforeſaid union and heat communicated to the parts. For the Vital Spirits are not excited in the Arterious Blood for their own ſakes alone, neither are they diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted into the parts, and united to them, only for their own advantage; but chiefly, that they may enliven and dignifie the inherent conſtitution of the ſolid Parts, and ſo actuate and promote their faculties. For as the heat of it ſelf is only potentially viſible, unleſs it be irradiated with light, ſo thoſe inherent faculties of attracting, retaining, concocting, ſecreving, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, are dead as it were and meerly potential, when they are deprived of the vivification and erogation of the Vital afflux, This is moſt clearly conſpicuous in a lipothymy; for upon the defect of the Vital influx, all thoſe faculties ſuddenly fail, decay, languiſh. But ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the faculties are eſtabliſhed upon ſome conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is both the cauſe and ſubject of them, it might be demanded in which Conſtitution of the parts it is grounded? We anſwer, in reſpect of the potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Nature they are radicated in the Natural Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:169706:61"/>
which we have before deſcribed; but that in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Actuated and Elivened Eſſence that they depend likewiſe upon the Vital influx. And we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in general that the participative Vital Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which we have already aſſerted to conſiſt in Three things, conjoyned with the Natural Conſtitution, is the total and adequate, both cauſe and ſubject of all thoſe faculties. But it would be a tedious degreſſion, and inconſiſtent with our purpoſe, to make enquiry how thoſe Conſtitutions can produce this or that facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty determinate in its Species. For the preſent we will only run over thoſe faults of the faculties aforeſaid which occur in this affect.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The faſhioning vertue here erreth by an une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual purging out of the Vital Blood in divers parts, as we have diſcourſed above. Hereupon the Head and the Liver grow to an unmeaſurable bigneſs; the firſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected parts are extenuated, the ends of the Bones ſtick out, and ſomtimes the Bones themſelves, which are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſtraight, wax crooked.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Concoctive faculty is weak in this Diſeaſ and in the firſt affected part by reaſon of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent cold diſtemper, the penury and benummedneſs of the Spirits, the brittle and ſlippery union of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſpirits with the Natural Conſtitution, and by reaſon of the feeble imprinted Vital heat.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Attractive, Retentive, and Expulſive Faculties, ſeem not to recede much from their Natural Condition; yet the Attractive is ſomwhat more ſlow than ought to be; the Retentive, by reaſon of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal lubricity is ſomwhat weaker, and the Expulſive is more vehement for the ſame Cauſe.</p>
            <p>And thus at length we have diſpatched the faithful examination of the faults of the Vital Conſtitution in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:169706:62"/>
this affect. The Animal Conſtitution ſhould now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the next diſquiſition, but that ſom faults of the Natural Conſtitution; namly the Organical faults ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which have ſome dependance upon ſome of the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted faults of the Vital Conſtitution, do challenge this place, as moſt proper to themſelvs.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eing that the Organical faults in this Diſeaſ belong to the Inherent Conſtitution of the parts, thoſ indeed by the Law of juſt Method ſhould be immediatly after the ſimilary vices of the ſame Conſtitution; but as we have noted above, the Reaſon and Cauſ of them muſt be derived from the faults of the Vital Conſtitution lately mentioned, and therfore we are conſtrained to premiſe the examination of theſe, and to reſerv the conſideration of the other for another place.</p>
            <p>The Organical faults in this affect are fitly reduced to theſe Heads.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To the extenuation and leanneſs of certain parts namly, the parts firſt affected.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To the unreaſonably augmented magnitude of ſome parts, as the Brain, the whol Head, and the Liver.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To the tumors or lanching out of certain
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:169706:62"/>
Bones, as of the Bones to the Wreſts, to the Ankles, and the ends of the ribs.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, To the bowing of certain Bones, as it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happneth to the Bones of the Cubit, and the Shin Bone, ſomtimes to the Bone of the Thigh and Sholder.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, To the poynted figure and narrowneſs of the breaſt.</p>
            <p>And theſe faults are reckoned beneath among the Symptoms and ſigns of the Diſeaſ, not becauſe they are indeed meer Symptoms, but becauſ they are obvious to the Senſes, and ſo do fitly ſupply the place of ſigns, both in reſpect of the parts of the Eſſence of the Diſeaſ more deeply retired, and alſo in reſpect of the hidden cauſes therof. For whatſoever is perceived by the ſenſ, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it ſelf repreſenteth ſomwhat elſ to the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that is obſcure, hath the formality of a ſign. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed theſe faults are parts of the ſecondary Eſſence of the Diſeaſ, ſeing that they are the vitious Conſtitutions of the Organs depraving the action, and have a dependance upon the other parts of the Eſſence of the Diſeaſ.</p>
            <p>The common cauſ almoſt of al theſe recited affects ſeems to be an uneven or diſproportionate nouriſhment or <hi>Alogotrophy</hi> of the parts. Now this dependeth chiefly upon two cauſes in this affect. The firſt is, the unequal inherent Conſtitution of the parts irregularly nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The diſparity between the inherent Conſtitutions of the firſt affected parts, and the Head and Bowels, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo wel collected by what hath been already ſaid, but that it may deſerve a further inculcation. The laſt ca uſ, which is indeed of equal moment, is the very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal diſtribution of the Arterious Blood into the parts unevenly nouriſhed. That the Blood is unequally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed in this affect we have already ſhewed, here we
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:169706:63"/>
only infer that that muſt needs produce an unequal nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition of the parts. Al Creatures the more liberally they feed the more fat and fleſhly they are unleſs ſom o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other impediment doth intervene; but if the du quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of aliment be ſubſtracted, they grow lean, and are dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more and more extenuated. Why ſhould we not ſuppoſe that the ſame thing happeneth in the Parts of Creatures? the Blood, or at leaſt ſomwhat contained in the Blood, is acknowledged for the laſt aliment of al the parts, wher therfore that is liberally diſpenſed to one part, and ſparingly to another, certainly, it is no wonder if one part be exceſſively augmented, and another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly extenuated. But theſe things may ſuffice in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. In particular,</p>
            <p>Firſt, We aſſert, that the firſt affected parts in this Diſeaſ do dayly wax lean and fal away. Proof of this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion cannot be reaſonably expected, ſeing that dayly experience yeeldeth an occular demonſtration of it. But why thoſe parts are ſo extenuated, that may require ſom reaſons, and we offer theſe.</p>
            <p>The firſt is deduced from the primary eſſence of the Diſeaſ; namly, from a cold diſtemper, a penury, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>activity of the inherent Spirits in the parts aforeſaid, For by this means the attractive, retentive, and conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive faculty, do execute their functions in thoſe parts, unduly and ineffectually.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is brought from the looſneſs, ſoftneſs, and internal ſlipperineſs of the ſame parts; for hereupon the expulſive faculty is too much irritated, the breathing is too eaſy and diſſipative, the circulation of the Blood is to ſlippery, the retentive faculty through the weaknes of it, parteth with the aliment too ſoon, and with too much facility: and this very thing almoſt happneth here in theſe parts, which befalleth the Guts in a <hi>Lyentery.</hi>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:169706:63"/>
Howſoever it be, the expenſes exceed the incoms, and by conſequent thoſe parts are extenuated.</p>
            <p>The third Reaſon ariſeth from the unequal diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and indeed defective in the firſt affected parts, of which we have already ſuperabundantly diſcourſed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We affirm, that in this affect the greatneſs of the Head, and eſpecially of the Liver, as alſo of the Brain is unreaſonably increaſed. Somtimes the <hi>Palſy</hi> in the Head is conjoyned, which nevertheleſs we ſuppoſe to be of a different Species, and no part of this Diſeaſ: although we grant, that this affect may ſomtimes give occaſion to the ſupervening <hi>Hydrocephalus.</hi> Moreover, we have ſomtimes ſeen, the Conſumption being ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>induced upon this affect, and long continuing alſo, the Face, and the parts about the Head to be ſomwhat exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate before death. But this was produced by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, not by this Diſeaſ we now treat of. But that we may give a reaſon of that greatneſs unmeaſurably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in the Parts aforeſaid. We note,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the parts belonging to the Head and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the Bowels, do receive the Nerves from that part of the Spinal Marrow, which is included within the Skul, and therfore that theſe parts are not neceſſarily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to that unhappy condition of the firſt affected parts. Wherfore no reaſon doth compel us to affirm, that theſe augmented parts are either affected with a cold diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or a penury and dulneſs of Spirtts, or that the attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, retentive, or concoctive faculties are therupon vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated, and by conſequence that thoſe parts are totally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the firſt cauſe of that extenuation which befalſeth the parts firſt affected.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we obſerve that neither looſneſs, nor flac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidity, nor ſoftneſs, nor internal ſlipperineſs are predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant in thoſe immeaſurably augmented parts, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:169706:64"/>
that theſe qualities (as it happneth to the firſt affected parts) do not yeeld a more irritated expulſion then is requiſite, ſo that the exportation ſhould be feared to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the importation, which we have ſhewed to befal the extenuated parts.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We obſerve that the Blood in his circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by how much the more ſparingly it is diſtributed to the firſt affected parts, the more liberally it doth water and nouriſh theſe parts. This we have already proved, and it is needleſs to inſert more arguments to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Theſe things therfore being obſerved, the Reaſon is playn, why the parts aforeſaid are unmeaſurably and irregularly augmented. For if the attractive retentitive and concoctive faculties be not weakned in them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our firſt annotation, and the expulſive be not immoderately irritated according to the ſecond, and in the interim if ſufficient aliment be diſpenſed to them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the third, the bulk of them muſt needs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſ beyond proportion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We affirm that the protuberancies or ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of the Bones in the Wreſts, Ankles, and the ends of the Ribs do vitiate the Organ in a twofold reſpect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> namly, in reſpect of the greatneſs, and alſo of the figure. The parts vitiated in both reſpects are obvious to the Eys, and therfore we ſhal ſuperſede al further proof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But why are the Bones ſtretched out after that manner in thoſe places?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truly it is very hard to render a Reaſon therof, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perhaps dare we engage our ſelves by promiſe to give ſatisfaction in all reſpects herein to the curious. Therfore inſtead of an anſwer we dedicate to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe ſubſequent obſervations as not altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Bones in many do agree with the ſubſtance
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:169706:64"/>
of the Bowels. For firſt they conſiſt of a certain ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary matter ſevered from the preterfluent Blood, not needing any laborious aſſimilation, and ſeem to admit a moſt eaſie nutrition till they arrive at the exaltation and higheſt pitch of their encreaſe; Moreover, they ſeem to be nouriſhed until by age they are brought to an extream drineſs, and they ſeem not to be obnoxious to any conſiderable extenuation; ſo the ſubſtances of the Bowels are ſimilary being joyned together by the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration almoſt of the Blood alone, and they likewiſe eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encreaſ, and are difficultly and rarely extenuated. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, The Bones are nouriſhed almoſt after the ſame manner, as the <hi>Parenchymata</hi> or ſubſtances of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels: Through the Arteries they receive the blood, through the Veins they amandate and conveigh away the ſuperfluous portion of it, and inſtead of Veſſels of the third kind whereby the excrements are expelled, they are furniſhed with Cels and Cavities. Some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may doubt of the Arteries of the Bones, becauſe ſo hard and rigid a part may ſeem unapt to admit any pulſation of the Arteries within it, we grant indeed that the Bones in regard of their hardneſs and ſtifneſs are leſs apt for the pulſation of the Arteries, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we acknowledg that they admit not within them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny notable ramification or branching of Arteries; but if any man will from thence infer that no Arteries are admitted into them, truly herein he muſt expect our abſolute denyal, for they are living Parts, they are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, they grow, and they exerciſe the Attractive, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive, Concoctive, and Expulſive faculties. Again, they receive the Blood, which they cannot do but by the conduit Pipes of the Arteries, and this is manifeſt by the bloodineſs of them, when the Bones of Living Creatures are either broken or any other way divided.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:169706:65"/>
In yong Creatures the ſpongy ſubſtance of the Bones, and the very Marrow is ſenſibly perfuſed with Blood, and the greateſt part of their Cavities is filled more with Blood than Marrow. In elder and greater Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures you may obſerve both Veins and Arteries through the Membranes enwrapping the Marrow; all which things do ſufficiently prove that the Blood is diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the very Bones. But wiſe Nature (who in the conformation of all the parts doth moſt equiſitely and aptly proportion all things) foreſeeing here that the Veins and Arteries could not conveniently be extended by a longer carnification through the ſubſtance of the Bones by reaſon of their hardneſs, ſhe caſteth that vaſt number of them, ſome being as ſmal as hairs, into al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inconſpicuous little holes in the Bones. But if you ſoundly boyl the Bones of greater Creatures theſe Orifices of the inſertion of the Veſſels may very eaſily be perceived in the outward ſuperficies if you remove the Skin enwrapping the Bones. But let this ſuffice concerning the Veins and Arteries of the Bones, ſeing that this matter is ſomwhat incoherent with our ſcope. As for the Veſſels of the third kind, ſeing that the excrements of the Bones were not about to prove al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together improfitable, nor could commodiouſly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled out of the Body, Nature, inſtead of a Veſſel of the third kind hath made certain Recepticles (namely Cavities and Cels) into which ſhe would exno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rate and caſt aſide the excrements, namely that fat part which is altogether improfitable to furniſh the Bones with nouriſhment. There are ſome who ſuppoſe the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to be the principal nouriſhment of the Bones, but very inconſiderately, ſeing that the Marrow, as we have ſaid, is altogether unapt for the generation and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Bones, for the bones are not only moſt
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:169706:65"/>
hard and ſolid and naturally of a white colour, but they conſiſt of a certain earthy and clammy ſubſtance, which conditions differ very much from Marrow. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, Marrow cannot by any art be ſublimated to the firmneſs of a Bone. Moreover, Marrow melteth, and is diſſolved with a moderate heat of the fire; but the Bones endure the moſt ardent flames of fire without any melting. Beſides, Boil the Bones as long as you pleaſe, they reſolve into a gelly, not into the ſubſtance of, or like Marrow. Again, Bones may be worn to pouder, ſo cannot Marrow. Certain therfore it is, that the marrow is not the Aliment of the Bones but a kind of excrement, or rather ſecrement of them, profitable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and therfore to be preſerved in thoſe receptacles. For the Bones being otherwiſe dry, cold, and rough, would be unapt for motion, were they not moiſtned and made ſlippery by the exundations and exhalations of the Marrow, and cheriſhed by their gentle heat. All theſe things are confirmed by this ſingle experiment. In yong Creatures the greatneſs of the Bones being conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, there is leſs Marrow in the Bones, and more Blood, than in greater Creatures. In the Embrion, there are ſcarce obſerved any ſigns or appearances of Marrow deſtinct from the Blood. But after the birth the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dullary ſubſtance is daily augmented, and it is viſibly perceived to be leſs and leſs intermingled with the Blood; again in the maturity of years the Bones are filled almoſt with pure and ſincere Marrow, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conſiderable commixture of Blood; but in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of old age it is credible that the Bones are leſs and leſs watered with the circulation of the Blood; and perhaps the Marrow it ſelf upon the ſuſpenſion and ceſſation of the nouriſhment is rather augmented than diminiſhed; in which reſpect the propounded experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:169706:66"/>
muſt be peradventure limitted. Thirdly, the Bones (the Teeth perhaps excepted) cannot want their nervs, at leaſt very little, neither are they ſuppoſed to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſenſible, then by reaſon of the <hi>Perioſtium,</hi> or the Fibers therof faſtned into the Orifices of the Bones. In like manner the ſubſtances of the Bowels ſeem to obtain that dul ſenſe, which they poſſeſs, rather by the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes and veſſels, then from their own ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>From hence we collect, that the Bones in this affect are not much otherwiſe affected, than the ſubſtance of the Bowels in reſpect of nouriſhment. We have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhewed that the Bones are not to be reckoned among the firſt affected parts, as likewiſe neither the <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymata:</hi> only we here further affirm that all the Bones univerſally conſidered, are not perhaps leſs ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly nouriſhed in this Diſeaſ, than they uſually are in ſound Bodies, for if they be nouriſhed by way of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>augmentation, or joyning together, as the <hi>Parenchyma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> are, and with ſuch facility alſo, if they poſſeſs Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and Veins delated unto them, and Cells, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities to receive the Blood, if they be not in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and condition of the firſt affected parts, and if they receive not Nerves from the ſpinal Marrow; it is very credible that they do duly receive, laudably retain, and perfectly concoct their Aliment. Moreover, If you will conſult experience, Children afflicted with this Diſeaſ, a regard being had to their age, and the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of their parts, weigh heavier than others for the moſt part, as we have ſomtimes obſerved, which very thing ſeemeth partly to be aſcribed to the greatneſs of the Bones. Although in this caſe we wiſh more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, certain, and accurate obſervations, which others who are befriended with opportunity may oblige the world withal: in the mean time we ſuppoſe in general
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:169706:66"/>
that the Bones are not illiberally nouriſhed in this Diſeaſ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some may reply,</hi> That what hath hitherto been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken doth concern the nouriſhment of the Bones in general, but that they yield not a reaſon of the protuberances in them.</p>
            <p>We deny it not, but ſeing that theſe faults of the Bones depend upon their unequal nouriſhment, as we have already proved, we ſuppoſed it would not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to purpoſe ſome reaſon of their nouriſhment in general: now we draw neerer to the aforeſaid ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of the Bones. And we obſerve, Secondly, That thoſe tumors of the Bones are not of a different kind in reſpect of the other parts of the ſame Bone, but that they are parts altogether ſimilary and of the like kind with the reſt, and that they are not faulty in reſpect of the ſimilary Conſtitution, but in reſpect only of their greatneſs and figure.</p>
            <p>From hence it followeth thirdly, that theſe ſwellings are not produced by any illegetimate matter of the Bones, or by any other vertue than the ſame by which and from which the other are generated.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That the ſaid ſwellings are produced by an unequal nouriſhment of the Bones, as by a more liberal nouriſhment of the ſwelling parts, and a ſparing nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of the other parts of the ſame Bone. And theſe Three laſt obſervations we have already abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proved where we treated of the affected parts.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, We obſerve the <hi>Epiphyſes</hi> of the Bones in the Wreſts and Ankles, and perhaps in ſome other places, to be more ſoft and ſpongy than in the other parts of the ſame Bones. And peradventure they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive into themſelves greater Arteries and Veins, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though indeed we are not yet fully aſſured of this. The
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:169706:67"/>
tops of the Ribs are alſo much more ſoft and ſpongy than the other parts of them. From whence we infer that thoſe more ſoft and ſpongy parts of the Bones may more eaſily and freely admit the circulation of the Blood, and therefore be more plentifully nouriſhed than the reſt of the parts of them. You will ſay, That ſoftneſs and ſpongineſs of thoſe parts is obſerved to be as well in healthful Children as in thoſe affected with this Diſeaſ. We grant it, but yet it muſt needs be, that thoſe parts which are of a more compacted ſubſtance, and with difficulty admit the circulation of the Blood, muſt be affected and obſtructed upon lighter cauſes, then thoſe parts that are more open, and more eaſily receive it. But the Blood in this affect is tranſmitted to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts ſomwhat more cold, viſcous, and thick, then it ought to be; therfore thoſe parts which are unapt to admit the circulation of it, thoſe are more apt to be ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what obſtructed, and leſs liberally nouriſhed.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Why alſo are not thoſe ſoft and ſpongy parts more liberally nouriſhed in ſound Bodies, ſeing that they <hi>(as hath been ſaid)</hi> do more plentifully receive the Blood?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We anſwer, Becauſe, as in health thoſe parts do in a larger meaſure receive the Blood thorow the Arteries, ſo they remit the ſame more plentifully thorow the veins which certainly doth preſerve them from that exceſſive augmentation unto which otherwiſe they would grow. But in this affect the ſame parts by reaſon of the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thickneſs, and viſcoſity of the Blood, do perhaps more ſparingly and more ſlowly remit it, then it is pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in to them; and therfore from that abundance and exceſs of the Blood, thoſe parts do ſomwhat increaſe; whilſt the other parts of the Bones by reaſon of the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs of the cavity of the Artery, are not perhaps ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently nouriſhed with Blood, wherby to obtain an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:169706:67"/>
nutrition and increaſ. And from hence (at leaſt probably) we deduce the inequallity of the nutrition of the Bones in this affect. But the condition of the Blood wherby in this Diſeaſ it is apt to obſtruct an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> parts tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row which it floweth, ſeems to have a peculiar reſpect to the quality of the Bones. For in the Bowels, the Lungs excepted, the Blood doth ſeldom Generate obſtructions, as alſo ne ither in the firſt affected Parts: However it be the Bony ſubſtance, either becauſe it is incapable of the internal ſlipperineſs, or becauſe the nutritive juice in the mas of Blood is peculiarly apt to congeal in the parts ſo vehemently fixed: or laſtly, becauſe it hath in its own nature ſome affinity with the Bones: we ſay, the Bony ſubſtance is eaſily infeſted with obſtructions in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſ, and therupon it happneth to be unequally nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Faults of breeding Teeth</hi> are likewiſe to be referred hither, ſeing that they alſo ſeem to depend upon this une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual nutrition of the Bones. For if the Teeth ſhould be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually nouriſhed, they would be of a uniform ſubſtance, and would not fal out by pieces, as it here frequently happneth. For the ſimilary parts, when they are equally nouriſhed, acquire not ſuch an interrupted and unequal conſiſtence, as to be eaſily broken in pieces. Wherfore ſeing the Teeth are parts naturally delighting in a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary ſubſtance, were they equally nouriſhed, they ſhould enjoy an equal and uniform conſiſtance, and would ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther continue firm in their gums, or would fal out whol: And there can ſcarce any other reaſon be given, why they ſhould be broken and fal out more on one ſide, or in one part then another. We grant indeed that their aptneſs to break, may hitherto conduce very much: but we conceive that even that aptneſs to break, doth in great part de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the unequal nutrition aforeſaid. For otherwiſe
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:169706:68"/>
the Teeth do uſually obtain a very firm, ſolid, &amp; coherent ſubſtance; and the truth is, they ſeem to conſiſt eſpecially in this viſcous affect of a very matter. For the Blood for the moſt part is obſerved to be more viſcous and thick then ordinary, ſo that this aptneſs to break off the Teeth, cannot be ſo eaſily aſcribed to a defect of viſcoſity in the matter, as it may much more probably to the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quallity of the nutrition. We conclude therfore that the ſtanding out of the Bones, and likewiſe the faults of the Teeth, do proceed from the unequal nutrition of theſe parts, ariſing from a peculiar obſtructive diſpoſition of the Blood, having reference eſpecially to the Bones. Now we proceed to the crookedneſs of the Bones in this affect.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, In this affect the Bones are frequently ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what crooked, eſpecially the Shin Bones, and the leſſer Bones of the Legs; alſo the Bones of the Cubit, the leſſer of the two long Bones of the Cubits, and the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Shank-Bone, ſomtimes the Bones of the Sholder and Thigh: ſom Joynts alſo becom crooked, ſomtimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſomtimes outwards: the whole Spine is likewiſe many times bended, ſomtimes it is wreathed like the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>S;</hi> namly, partly forwards, partly backwards, and ſomtimes partly to the right Hand, partly to the left.</p>
            <p>Some aſcribe <hi>this crookedneſs of the Bones,</hi> to the ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding faculty of them; for ſay they, in the tender age of Children, the Bones themſelves are not ſo ſtiff ſtubborn, and inflexible, as in their riper years; and therfore upon the invaſion of this Diſeaſ, they are rendred in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree eaſily flexible. Therfore they rebuke the Nurſes, which too ſoon commit the children to their Feet, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, that the Bones are made crooked by the ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed burthen of their Bodies. Others alſo tax the Nurſes of imprudence in ſwadling them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:169706:68"/>
But we cannot yeeld our ful aſſent in all reſpects to theſe Reaſons. And firſt we flatly deny, that the Bones of Children afflicted with this Diſeaſ are more flexible, or leſs ſtiff and friable then the Bones of others. For we have already proved, that the Bones in this affect do not differ in reſpect of their ſimilary ſubſtance from the Bones of ſound perſons. Beſides, no man hitherto wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of credit hath atteſted that he hath ſeen the Bones flexible in this Diſeaſ. Moreover, if we ſhould grant that in this tenderneſs of years the Bones might perhaps be ſomwhat bended, yet they would not continu ſo bent like lead or wax, but being left to their liberty they would return again to the proper poſition and figure of the parts. For they conſiſt not of any ductile matter, and therfore by being thus bent, they would either be broken or elſe doubtleſs they would endeavor to reobtain their former ſituation. As for the ignorance or negligence of Nurſes, although we do not altogether excuſe it, yet cannot we juſtly impute this crookedneſs of the Bones to their careleſneſs. We ſee the Children of Poor People are ordered and handled with leſs care, and ſooner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their feet then the Children of the rich, yet the Children of Poor People are more rarely afflicted with this infirmity, then the Children of the rich. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we have known Nurſes uſe all manner of diligence as ſwadling them, and every other way laboring to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this incurvation, yet al their pains, otherwiſe praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, hath in this reſpect been ſucceſleſs. Therfore we muſt indeavor to find out ſome other cauſe of this crookedneſs.</p>
            <p>We compare the Bones therfore, in which this crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs uſeth to happen, to a Pillar, and not unaptly, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that when they are erected, they reſemble a Pillar; and from thence we deduce a demonſtration that illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:169706:69"/>
and makes the matter very plain. Let the Pillar therfore conſiſt of three ſtones A B C placed over one another. We ſuppoſe it ſuch an one as is perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly erected on every ſide, and of the ſame height: If therfore you ſhal faſten in a wedge on the right ſide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<figure>
                  <p>A</p>
                  <p>B</p>

               </figure> the ſtones A B through the line F D, the Head of the Pillar; Namely, the ſtone A will of neceſſity be bended towards D and wil make an Angle in D, and the height of the Pillar on the right ſide, wil be higher than on the left. In like manner if you drive in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wedg thorow G E into the ſtones BC the pillar wil be yet more bowed, and the angle wil be made in E. Now therfore the Pillar ſtands bent to the left hand after this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <figure>
                  <p>A</p>

                  <p>E</p>

                  <p>G</p>
               </figure> ABCFGDE. but if you build the Pillar of more ſtones, &amp; betwixt every two, as hath been ſaid, a wedg be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on one ſide, it will not reſemble the figure of a Pillar, but the proportion of a Bow, as by this following may be perceived.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:169706:69"/>

                  <p>B</p>
               </figure>
            </p>
            <p>Now that we may accommodate theſe things to the preſent buſineſs, if the Bones aforeſaid be more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully nouriſhed on one ſide, and therfore do grow out more on that then the oppoſite ſide, there is a neceſſity, that that muſt grow crooked: For here the overplenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful nutrition of that ſide, hath the ſame power after the ſame manner to bow the Bones, as the interpoſed wedg hath to bow the Pillar, ſave that the wedg is faſtned on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſome places of the ſide of the Pillar, and the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plentiful nutrition of the ſide of the Bone, is commonly equally made, according to the whol length therof. For the aliment received into the Bone, in what part it more liberally admitteth it, that part it obſtructeth: and like the wedg thruſt into the Pillar it extendeth it into an augmented length, wherupon the Bones muſt needs be bowed towards that ſide which is not lengthened in an equal degree with the other. Moreover, if the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one ſide of the Pillar happen only in one or two places therof and not in many, as in the third figure, then
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:169706:70"/>
ſo much the neerer the inflexion of it approacheth to the figure of a part of a Circle, or a Bow. But if the ſaid ſide according to the total longitude therof ſhould be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lengthened beyond the oppoſite ſide, doubtleſs it would be bended towards the oppoſite ſide, &amp; would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly reſemble a piece of a Circle or Bow without any Angles, juſt after the ſame manner, ariſeth the bending of the Bones in this affect: namly, from the greater lengthning of the ſide moſt nouriſhed; for ſeing that that lengthning happneth by the received aliment, according to all the parts of that ſide, an Angular figure cannot be expected, or one compounded of many ſtraight ones an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly connexed, but a crooked one like a Bow, wherin the convex part is conſtituted by the ſide, plentifully nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, &amp; the concave or hollow part by the ſide, which is ſparingly nouriſhed. But when it happneth that ſome part of the convex ſide of a crooked Bone is diſproportionatly nouriſhed, in reſpect of the oppoſite ſide, without all doubt the convex Bone wil ſtick out more on that part then in the reſt: and ſo from the inequallity of the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, we have given a reaſon of the crookedneſs of the Bones in this affect. We wil ad for a higher confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this matter. An obſervation raiſed from the cure of this crookedneſs of the Bones. The Quacks of our Country are wont to rub dayly the hollow, not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex ſides of the Bones, and that rubbing, ſay they, doth very much conduce to the cure, but this doth rather hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. But it is certain that rubbing doth powerfully ſummon the nutritive juice out of the Bloody maſs into the part ſo rubbed, therfore if at any time you rub that hollow part which is inſufficiently nouriſhed, it is no wonder if it do good, ſeing that thereby the aliment is more plentifully allured, and the heat of the part is alſo excited and augmented; neither on the other ſide is the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:169706:70"/>
Gibbous part of the Bone, being hurt by rubbing to be wondred at, becauſe by that means the aliment is attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to that part which was before ſuperabundantly nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed: beſides, the Oyntments, which may cheriſh the inherent heat, and ſtrengthen the nutritive faculties, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the rubbing, do moſt good, when they are applyed to the hollow part of the Bone; but the convex part a ſtrait ligature which may reſtrayn the riſing up of the Bones is uſually fitted with deſired ſucceſs: chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for this reaſon, becauſe the capillary Arteries which convey the Blood, or nutritive juyce, to that ſide of the Bone, are bound up by ſuch a ligature, and therupon the nutriment is leſſened. And theſe things ſhal ſuffice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the crookedneſs of the Bones in this affect.</p>
            <p>Moreover, To this Article we opportunely ad the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion of ſom of the Joints, as of the Knees, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles, which happneth very frequently in this Diſeaſ. ſomtimes being made inwardly, ſomtimes outwardly, And this bending alſo ſeemeth to be not unfitly referred to the inequallity of nutrition. For if it happen by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal nutrition, that one ſide of the Shank-Bone be ſo lengthned more then the other: ſuppoſe outwardly, that it doth ſomwhat lift up the outward part of the <hi>Epiphyſis</hi> of the Shank-Bone above the inward part, the joynt in the Knee muſt needs ſtand outwardly bent; and on the contrary, if the inward part be lifted up, and the outward depreſſed, the ſame Joynt muſt needs ſtand inwardly
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:169706:71"/>
bent: as may be eaſily perceived by the following Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.</p>

In the Joynt of the Knee, A B, that part of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance of the Shank-bone B, in the two firſt Figures, is higher than the other part of the ſame appendance; whereupon the Bone of the Thigh (is inwardly bowed, and ſo likewiſe is the Shin-bone D; but the Joynt A B is thruſt ſomwhat outwardly. But in the two laſt Figures all the contrary things may be obſerved. The Joynt A B is inwardly, becauſe that part of the Shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone A, is higher than the other part of it B. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it muſt needs lift up the inner and lower top of the Thigh-bone, ſo that the Thigh-bone will be bent outwardly, and the Joynt inwardly.</p>
            <p>The ſame thing likewiſe may happen in the Ankle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones, and the turning Joynts of the Back, if the Bones faſtned to the Joynt be higher on one ſide than on the other. But in the Ankles, becauſe there, beſides the Shin-bone, the leſſer Bone of the Leg is alſo faſtned through the Joynt, it may ſo fall out, that the leſſer Bone below may ſtand out further than the Shin-bone, and ſo bend outwardly the Joynt of the Ankle; and on the contraty, if it happen that the Shin-bone be longer than the leſſer bone, the Joynt muſt needs be inwardly bent. Although we confeſs that ſuch an inequality of length between the Shin-bone and the leſſer Bone in the Leg doth not ſo often happen.</p>
            <p>Moreover, We ſuppoſe that the preternatural ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Spine doth rarely happen from the unequal altitude of the ſides of the turning Joynts of the Bones, but more often from another cauſe which we will now proſecute. We have already ſaid that the Spine is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what weak in this affect, and that Children afflicted with this Diſeaſ are unapt not only to motion, but alſo to ſtand upon their feet, yea, and to raiſe their backs by reaſon of the weakneſs of the Spine. Therefore
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:169706:72"/>
whenſoever their Bodies are raiſed, they ſeek ſomewhat to reſt upon, and they ſuffer their Spine to be bowed ſometimes forwards, ſometimes backwards, ſometimes to the right hand, and ſometimes to the left; whereby the burden of their Body may be reſted upon ſomthing that ſtands neer them. Hereupon it many times hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that the Ligaments of the turning Joynts of the Spine in that part which is moſt commonly bending out are looſned and lengthned, and on the oppoſite ſide they are contracted; ſo that intract of time the Spine cannot be erected according to the ſtraight and natural Figure. And truly in this caſe we cannot excuſe the Nurſes indiligence or negligence, becauſe they do not obſerve with a ſufficient attentiveneſs, to which part the Children which they ſuckle are moſt prone to bend their Bodies, that by that means they may endeavor to bend them to the oppoſite part: In like manner alſo when Nurſes without due regard and care do too ſoon commit weak Children to the uſe of their feet, it may happen, that, when the regular motion of the Muſcles is too weak to bear the Body, Children may ſuffer either their Knee or Ankle to be bowed to one ſide; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ligaments of the Joynt are extended either on the inner or the outward ſide, and by conſequence the Ligaments on the contrary ſide are contracted, whereupon the joynt muſt needs be bended ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inwàrdly or outwardly, therfore although we have denied above that the crookedneſs of the Bones depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth hereupon, yet we grant that the bending of the Joynts may happen in weak Children by the negligence of the Nurſes. We grant moreover that the Bones which would otherwiſe have been ſtraight, may be croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by an unskilful ſwadling; yet that this cauſe doth happen exceeding rarely in this affect we are ſomewhat
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:169706:72"/>
confident, as we have ſhewed already more at large. Now we proceed to the pointedneſs and narrowneſs of the breaſt in this affect.</p>
            <p>We obſerve that this pointedneſs and narrowneſs of the Breaſt doth not appear preſently at the beginning of this affect, but that it ſucceedeth upon the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Diſeaſ, and is by degrees intended, till by the perſeverence of the Diſeaſ it becomes evident and conſpicuous, when the Breaſt forwards reſembleth the Breaſt of a Hen, or the Keel of a Ship. This viciated Figure of the Breaſt which otherwiſe ſhould be broad according to Nature, and not ſtraightned on the ſides, and even not pointed forwards, we reduce to four cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. The three former whereof we confeſs do contribute little efficacy to this matter, but the fourth alone doth almoſt al the work. Yet becauſe the three former do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſomthing, we will likewiſe recite them here in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Be this the firſt, In this affect the Bone of the Stern by reaſon of the augmented Bulk of the Liver is ſomwhat elevated or thruſt forward, wherupon there happeneth ſome part of the ſaid viciated Figure; and moreover from the ſame elevation of the Bone of the Stern there happeneth a certain contraction of the Ribs towards the Spine, and this cauſeth the other part
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:169706:73"/>
of the viciated Figure. This contraction of the Ribs we thus demonſtrate. Let the circle be A B 
<figure>

               </figure> C D, this muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be made of a flexible matter, but not equally extenſible, as for example, of the Bone of a Whale. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the ſides A C are both ſtretched from one another, ſo that line of diſtance is produced into length between A C, then the ſides of that circle D B are neceſſarily contracted almoſt in equal degree, and by the ſame means the line of late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſtance from D to B is abreviated; for the Circle becomes an Oval Figure, as any man ſhall find who wil take the pains to reduce it to experiment. For the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure will be changed into this form which the Figure following doth expreſs;
<figure>
                  <p>A</p>
                  <p>B</p>

                  <p>D</p>
               </figure> In which the line of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between A and C is repreſented longwiſe, and withal the line D B appears to be abreviated, and the Circle becomes Oval; neither is there need of more words to prove this matter.</p>
            <p>Now it muſt be known that the oppoſite couples of the Ribs do expreſs a

certain rude kind of circular Figure, eſpecially the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt which chiefly faſhion the Breaſt, by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spine on the hinder part, and the Stern on the fore part. Nor ſhould it trouble any man, becauſe they will not make an exact and perfect Circle, ſeing that our demonſtration is as effectual in a circular Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure how imperfect ſoever, as in the moſt exquiſite and perfect; provided that there be a coherence among all the parts, that they be not diſtorted, that they be flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but not eaſily extenſible; which conditions are ſufficiently conſpicuous in the Figure of the Ribs even now propoſed to view. Therefore if in this affect the Bone of the Stern be ſomwhat elevated forwards, that it may yield room to the augmented Bulk of the Liver, the Ribs towards the Spine muſt needs be drawn in nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to one another, whereupon the Breaſt muſt una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably be laterally ſtraightned, the latitude of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſſened.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some may ſay,</hi> If the riſing of the Bone of the Stern did conduce any thing to the pointed Figure of the Breaſt, it would chiefly effect that about the inferior Ribs, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this elevation of the Stern doth begin at the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer part; but it is manifeſtly known to fall out other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; for the narrowneſs of the Breaſt happeneth chiefly about the Armpits, and afterwards beneath the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Bones; but the lower Ribs ſeem to be enlarged about the ſides rather than ſtraightned.</p>
            <p>We anſwer, That the Five lower Ribs are not arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated with the Stern, neither do they make a perfect Circle; and therefore in no wiſe do they relate to the propounded demonſtration; but the ſtretching of them dependeth upon another cauſ, namely, the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Hypocondriacal parts. Let it likewiſe be noted that we aſſign not this for the chief cauſ of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:169706:74"/>
viciated Figure, yea, we ſuppoſe that it conferreth very little towards it. And ſo we proceed to the ſecond cauſ of this viciated Figure, which we alſo conceive to be a very ſlight one.</p>
            <p>In this affect the <hi>Hypochondriacal</hi> parts is almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually obſerved to be full and ſtretched, namely both in reſpect of the greatneſs of the Liver, and alſo becauſ all the other Bowels almoſt which are contained in the bottom of the Belly are ſufficiently large; ſeing that as hath been ſaid, the firſt eſſence of this Diſeaſ is not rooted in them. And laſtly, Becauſ the Guts and the Ventricle are uſually more or leſs diſtended with wind. But now from that fulneſs and extenſion of the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriacal</hi> parts we may juſtly collect that in this affect the Ribs are drawn downwards a little more than is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient. For the greateſt extenſion is here obſerved in the oblick Muſcles that are extended beneath the <hi>Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driacal</hi> parts; Now the Muſcle obliquely diſcending hath toothed heads faſtned to the ſixth, ſeventh, eighth &amp; ninth Ribs, and the part of the broad tend on alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly aſcending is adjoyned to the grizles of the ninth, tenth, and eleventh Ribs. Wherfore ſeing that the ſaid Muſcles are almoſt pertually too much extended in this affect, they muſt needs in ſome manner draw the ſaid Ribs downwards, and ſeing all the Ribs are firmly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtned together by the intercoſtal Muſcles, it happened that in this affect al the Ribs are ſomwhat drawn down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:169706:74"/>
But now that theſe Ribs ſo drawn down do ſomwhat ſtraighten the Breaſt may be perceived by this following Figure.</p>

Let A B be the Back-Bone. CD E the Rib. F the Bone of the Stern. We ſuppoſe that every one may ſee here in the <hi>Skeleton,</hi> that the Ribs are not conjoyned with the Spine, according to the ſtraight Angle, but that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle beneath the Rib is ſomwhat leſs then the ſtraight Angle: So that if the Rib be drawn a little upwards, the Articulation of it approacheth neerer to a ſtraight line. We ſuppoſe alſo, that the circulation of the Rib, whether with the Spine or with the Stern abideth firm, and doth not draw upwards (leaſt any man ſhould er) ſave only the middle parts of the Rib between the ſaid Articulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. We ſay, therfore on the contrary by how much the more downwards the Rib is drawn, ſo much the more acute is the Angle with the Spine, which it then maketh: Wherfore that part of the Rib furtheſt diſtant from the Back-Bone A BC; (namly, D in each of the Figures) as being thrown downwards, it conſtitutes a more acute Angle with the Spine, ſo is it alſo leſs diſtant from the Spine then it was before, and rendreth the broadneſs of the Breaſt more narrow. For the ſides of the Breaſt were then indeed moſt broad, when the Ribs are moſt erected upon the Spine, according to a ſtraight line. For that part of the Rib D wil be then furtheſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the Back-Bone A B, as you may ſoon perceive if you compare the firſt and ſecond figure with the third. For in the third Figure, the Rib is expreſt erect in a ſtraight line, with the Back-Bone, and then that part of the Rib D is ſenſibly further diſtant from the Back-Bone A B, then it is in the firſt or ſecond figure, as he that wil examin them, ſhal quickly apprehend: but in the ſecond Figure, the Rib with the Spine is ſuppoſed to make a more acute Angle, and in proportion that part of it D (as you may perceive) is leſs diſtant from the Spine than the ſame part D in the ſame Figure, whoſe
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:169706:75"/>
Angle is ſuppoſed to be leſs acute; and yet that is much leſs diſtant from the Spine, then in the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> third Figure, whoſe Articulation is erected to a ſtraight Angle. We infer therfore, that the Ribs, when they are drawn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, do amplify the Breaſt ſidewiſe, but when they are drawn downwards, then they ſtraighten the Breaſt on the ſides.</p>
            <p>This is further confirmed in that, becauſe at ſuch time when the Breaſt is dilated; namly, when the breathing is rightly performed, the Ribs are drawn a little upwards by the ſtrength and force of the <hi>Intercoſtal Muſcles;</hi> and when the expiration is performed; namly, when the Breaſt is contracted, the ſame Ribs are drawn back again downwards by the help of the oblique <hi>Muſcles</hi> of the <hi>Abdomen.</hi> Any man may obſerve this in himſelf or in any other man eſpecially in great inſpirations and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirations. For in a vehement inſpiration he ſhal plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive at the ſame time to be lifted upwards, and withal to enlarge the breadth of the Breaſt; but in a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment expiration he ſhal feel the Ribs as it were bowed downwards, and at the ſame time contracted inwards. Neither of theſe things could happen, unleſs the poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ribs were ſuch, as that thoſe beneath in reſpect of the Spine, ſhould make an acute Angle, and being more depreſſed, ſhould make it ſo much the more acute, and by conſequence the Breaſt, ſhould be then moſt ſtraightned; and on the contrary being lifted upwards, they ſhould appracch neere to a ſtraight Angle, with the Spine, and ſo extend the ſides of the Breaſt. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therfore that the Ribs in this affect ar drawn ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what downwaads, and that the Breaſt is contracted on the ſides, by reaſon of the plenitude and tenſity of <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondrical</hi> parts; although we grant as we have intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above, that this cauſe is not ſo conſiderable, that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:169706:76"/>
we ſhould attribute any great part of this Diſeaſ unto it.</p>
            <p>Be this therfore the third, The Cauſ of this vitiated Figure of the Breaſt, <hi>Is a lateral growing of the Lungs in the Pleura,</hi> in this Diſeaſ eſpecially, being confirmed it is moſt frequently obſerved to happen. Doubtleſs ſuch an adnaſcency doth reſtrain and interrupt the motion of the Ribs outwardly, wherby the Breaſt is laterally dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For if the Rib, under which this adnaſcency lieth, ſhould endeavor forcibly to remove it ſelf, from the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Breaſt, there would be danger of pulling the Lungs that grow to it, or the <hi>Pleura</hi> it ſelf from the ribs with intollerable pain. For although the Lungs upon the ingreſs of the ayr admit an eaſy extenſion, according to al the parts therof, yet when they fal down, or are ſtuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed with thick humors (which moſt frequently happneth in this caſe) they ſcarce admit any notable diſtention, without diſſolving the unity either of ſom Veſſel, Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, or the ſubſtance of the Bowels themſelvs. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, whilſt we conſider that in ſound bodies the Lungs are very rarely laterally divided from the <hi>Pleura;</hi> and but in thoſe parts only of the cheſt, which were to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to motion at a conſiderable diſtance; namely, the Back, the Stern, the <hi>Mediaſtinum</hi> (that is the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes that divide the middle of the Belly) and perhaps the middle parts of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> &amp;c. We conceive that wiſe nature did this deliberatly and with deſign; namly, leaſt their connexions ſhould either offend the dilitations of the Breaſt, or render the Lungs themſelvs obnoxious to thoſe kind of calamities. However it be, it is ſcarce conceivable, but that preternatural growing together of the Lungs, with the <hi>Pleura</hi> more or leſs muſt hinder and retard the free ſpreading of the Ribs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſides, and therfore it conduceth a little at leaſt to occaſion the narrowneſs of the Breaſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:169706:76"/>
Be this the fourth, The cauſ of the vitiated Figure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, is an unequal nutrition of certain parts of the Ribs in reſpect of others. And this cauſe we affirm to be much more effectual then the reſt, to procure this Symptom. Which that we may demonſtrate, we aſſert firſt, that the ſeven uppermoſt Ribs do chiefly, if not ſolely, conſtitute this Figure of the Breaſt for the five lowermoſt, as they are not immediatly conjoyned with the Stern; So neither can they in any manner point, or elevate the Stern. Ad alſo, that ſeing (as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewed) they do not cloſe in perfect Circles, their Figure is eaſily movable, that it may more or leſs yeeld to the fulneſs of the <hi>Hypochondriacal</hi> parts. But the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upper Ribs are Articulated by their Grizles, with the Bones of the Stern: from whence it may perhaps com to paſs, that they do ſomwhat lift up foreright thoſ bones of the Stern, which they do touch, when the five lower Ribs being deprived of the contact of the Stern, cannot effect it. Secondly, We aſſert, that all the Ribs, and not only the five lowermoſt, but alſo the ſeven uppermoſt do admit an equal nutrition in this affect, and that they are more nouriſhed in one part then in another, &amp; therfore that they are more extended in length by that, then by the other, which is more ſparingly nouriſhed: and indeed that they grow more on that ſide in which they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned with the Griſtles of the Stern, and that they are leſs and more ſlowly lengthened on the other part, nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Head or top, wherby they are faſtned to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the Back. The Reaſon is, becauſ the forepart of any Rib is more ſoft and ſpongy, then the hinder part of it, as any man may make tryal in any Creature. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therfore (as it is clear by what hath been ſaid) that the ſofter parts of the Bones do in this affect more eaſily receive their aliment and augmentation, then the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:169706:77"/>
and more ſolid, it followeth that the foremoſt parts of the Ribs which are moſt ſoft, are more lengthened than the undermoſt. Thirdly, We aſſert, that in a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of a Circular or Anulary Figure, if one part of the Ring be more lengthened than another, the other parts muſt needs give place to this increaſ, or elſe that part ſo unequally lengthened, wil either outwardly hang out, or be inwardly knotted, either upwards or downwards, and be bent either one, or many of theſe ways. This we thus demonſtrate. Let the Circle or Ring be A

                  <p>B</p>

                  <p>D</p>
               </figure> B. Let the former parts of it be ſuppoſed to be lengthened from A to B. But the other parts of it; namly, C D E to remain in their poſition, and not at al to yeeld to the ſaid lengthning. Theſe things being ſuppoſed, the leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened portion of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, namely, A B muſt needs be either lifted up out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, or depreſſed inwards, either bent upwards or downwards or variouſly: For otherwiſe the diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the limits of the ſtring F would not ſuffice to contain that portion of the Circle now lengthened, the figure of the Bow being changed. For thoſe limits did only ſuffice before; therfore the Bow being lengthened, and not the ſtring, or the tops and limits of the ſtring, it cannot be, that the Bow ſhould be to the ſtring as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. It muſt be changed therfore, the bending being made either outwards or inwards, or upwards or down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, or many of theſe ways, as may be perceived by the Figures following. The firſt Figure repreſents a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:169706:77"/>
Bow outwardly prominent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The ſecond, Inwardly, and the third variouſly bent and intorted. And indeed the firſt doth very fitly ſet out the Figure of the Breaſt viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in this affect. For we have noted above, that the ribs articulated

               </figure> with the Stern &amp; Spine do make a kind of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Ring, and that they are in this affect ſooner nouriſhed, and lengthned in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, then in the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermoſt part, therefore in reſpect of the cauſe this Symptom fully and fitly agreeth with that Figure firſt deſcribed. Beſides, we have ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that the parts of the Circle do remain firm: that alſo in this affect may be accommodated to the lateral and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermoſt parts of the ribs For ſeing theſe grow much leſs then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, certainly, they may wel be ſuppoſed to be ſtable, unleſs, perhaps ſom may ſay, that either the ſides and hinder parts of the Ribs, by dilating themſelvs, or their Joynts, with which they are faſtned with the turning Joynts of the Back, by ſuffering the Ribs to be bended backwards, do yeeld
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:169706:78"/>
ſomwhat to that exceeding augmentation. But neither of theſe can be rightly ſaid. For firſt, the latter and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der parts of any Rib as they are more hard and ſolid, ſo are they likewiſe more ſtiff and ſtrong then the formoſt; now it is abſurd to imagine that the weaker parts of the ſame Rib can bend the ſtronger, or that the leſs flexible parts will yeeld to thoſe parts which are eaſily flexible. Wherfore the lateral and hinder parts of the ribs cannot be ſo bent, as that they ſhould yeeld to the formoſt leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened parts therof. As for the Joynts of the Ribs, doubtleſſe that Joynt, wherwith the Rib is conjoyned with the turning Joynt of the Breaſt, can by no means ſuffer the Rib to be bent ſo much backward, as that it ſhould yeeld to the lengthning therof; and that not only becauſe it is double; namly, in the hollowneſs of the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Joynt, and in the tranſverſal proceſs therof: and therfore very unapt to permit a backward motion. But chiefly, becauſe it is even ten times ſtronger than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Joynt, wherwith the ſame rib is faſtened to the Bone of the Stern. Now a Joynt ten times ſtronger, and withal double, and in ſuch a manner formed double that it is altogether unapt to endure any retrograde mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cannot by any means be imagined to yeeld back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, leaſt the Joynt ten times weaker ſhould be bent ſomwhat forwards. We muſt conclude therfore, that the lateral and hinder parts of the Ribs do not yeeld to that unequal production of them, which happneth forwards, and by conſequence, that in this reſpect they are to be accounted firm; and therfore that unequal lengthning, muſt needs change the figure of them, on the forepart; and that by bending them there either upwards or down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, or inwards or outwards, or diverſe ways.</p>
            <p>This bending of the Ribs here cannot be made either upwards or downwards, becauſe the Ribs in regard of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:169706:78"/>
their latitude are unapt to be bowed either way. Ad alſo becauſe that they are firmly reſtrained by the Intercoſtal Muſcles in their poſition; ſo that without offers of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to theſe Muſcles, they can ſcarce be bent, either upwards or downwards.</p>
            <p>That that elongation cannot, or indeed very ſcarcely can bow the Rib inwards may thus be proved; becauſe, the greatneſs of the Liver is repugnant to ſuch a moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For we have proved before, that the greatneſs of that Bowel doth ſomwhat lift up the Bone of the Stern outwardly or forwardly. Then the very figure of a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Rib doth evidently contradict the inward making of any plication, or bending. Laſtly, becauſe that elon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation doth not many ways bend the Ribs, it may from thence alſo be inferred, that ſuch a bending would infer a compound Figure, and ſhould neceſſarily contain ſom of the ſimple figures before rejected.</p>
            <p>Wherfore we conclude, that that unequal length of the Ribs on the forepart, muſt needs change their outward Figure, elevating the Bone of the Stern, and then point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forwards the Figures of the Breaſt (otherwiſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt even.) The following Scheams do lively expreſs the manner of it.</p>

Let A be the Bone of the Stern, B the turning Joynts of the Back. C and D the two oppoſite Ribs, which as we have ſaid do make a kind of Ring. Therfore if the forepart of the Ribs; namly, between C and A and between D and A be lengthned, and yet the parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween C B and D B are no way anſwerable to this elon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, the figure of the Ring muſt needs be outwardly changed. Therfore ſeing that the Rib is, (as we have already ſhewed) unapt to be bent either upwards or downwards, or inwards, it muſt needs be outwardly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, as it is expreſt in the ſecond Figure, wher the ſtern A by reaſon of the elongation of the part of the Rib CA and D A is repreſented, as if it were outwardly pointed, which is the very vitiated Figure of the Breaſt in this Diſeaſ.</p>
            <p>Beſide the cauſes of the narrowneſs of the Breaſt hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto commemorated, we can here ad the ſmal increaſe of the Ribs between C and B and alſo between B and D. For the Juſt Latitude of the breaſt doth chiefly depend upon a du augmentation of thoſe parts of the Ribs. For if thoſe parts of the Ribs do grow to a juſt length, they muſt neceſſarily dilate the Breaſt unto the Ribs almoſt in a juſt proportion, that little of the narrowneſs only being taken away, which the former cauſes alone were able to introduce. For by how much the more thoſe parts of the Ribs are lengthened, by ſo much the more alſo the Lateral part of the Rib D and the part C wil be diſtant from the Back-Bone B, and wil make the Breaſt ſo much the broader. On the contrary when upon the increaſ of the other parts of the Body, thoſe parts of the Ribs are but little, or not at al augmented, they muſt of neceſſity be laterally leſs diſtant from the center of the Breaſt then is meet, and therfore the Breaſt muſt
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:169706:80"/>
be ſtraightned towards the ſides. For the ſides of the rib C and D are ſo much the leſs diſtant from the Back-Bone, and the center of the Breaſt, as the parts of the Ribs between C B and D B are leſs lengthned. And let theſe things ſuffice to have been ſpoken concerning the narrowneſs and acumination of the Breaſt in this affect: With which we put at laſt an end to this diſquiſition of the Organical vices occurring in this Diſeaſ.</p>

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:169706:80"/>
the opinion of Antiquity, and the common opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Animal faculty, and otherwiſe expounding the matter do ſubſtitute a ſomwhat different deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we thought good to offer both to the Readers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
            <p>According to the former and vulgarly received opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and deſcription of the Animal faculty, the animal conſtitution is that affection of the Body which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in the generation and due motion of the Animal Spirits. Now by the due motion of the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits they underſtand the excurſion of them from the Brain thorow the Nerves like lightning, and again their recourſe back to the Brain, whereby they declare unto it what is perceived by the Organs of the outward Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
            <p>Others (as we have ſaid) do otherwiſe explicate this matter. They grant indeed that the Animal conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth include the generation and deſtribution of the Animal Spirits but they ſay that that ſwift motion of the Flux and Reflux of the Animal Spirits like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, is inconceivable in the Nerves, and if it be not unprofitable, yet certainly it is very little neceſſary to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh the animal faculty. But inſtead of this they ſubſtitute in time of waking a certain contractive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of a moving endeavor of the very ſubſtance of the Brain, of the Spinal Marrow, of the Nerves ariſing from thence, and of the parts into which they are deſtributed. And this motion or endeavor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth (ſay they) a certain Tenſity in the aforeſaid parts, by whoſe force all the alterations imprinted in thoſe parts by any objects, are communicated to the Brain. For as in a Harp when the ſtrings are ſtretched to a juſt pitch, if they be ſtricken in the moſt gentle manner at either end, that motion in a moment, at
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:169706:81"/>
leaſt a Phyſical one, runneth to the other end; ſo they likewiſe affirm that any Nerve being moved which is duly ſtretched without the Skull, that motion is exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Brain it ſelf by reaſon of the continuity and Tenſity of the ſaid parts, and there fixeth a certain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion conformable to the cauſ thereof. But in time of ſleep they ſuppoſe the Brain, the Spinal marrow, and ſome of the Nerves to be ſomwhat looſned. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they ſay perpetually and ſimply that the foremoſt connexions of the Spinal Marrow with the Brain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main looſ continually during ſleep; but they grant that the hindermoſt connexions with the <hi>Cerebethi</hi> are ſomwhat extended, as in Night-walkers, and ſo by that means they do in ſome ſort diſcern outward objects, but they judg not of them by common ſenſe, but as it were reflected from the memory to the Fantaſie. Neither do they ſuppoſe it neceſſary that all the inferior parts of the Spinal Marrow, and therfore the Nerves from thence proceeding ſhould be perpetually looſned during ſleep: ſeeing that moſt Birds ſleep ſtanding upon their feet; ſeing that reſpiration in time of ſleep doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe the Tenſity of ſome Nerves; and laſtly, ſeing where ſleep firſt ſteals in, the uppermoſt Nerves are wholly looſned before the neathermoſt. As for Dreams they conceive that they proceed from a various and chanceable agitation and commixture of divers impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions treaſured up in the memory, which are now again freſhly perceived by reaſon of a retained Tenſity in ſom parts of the Brain. But when in deep and profound ſleeps no dreams are repreſented, then they ſay that the whol Brain is looſned.</p>
            <p>Now whether the former opinion or this latter be moſt agreeable to truth, for the preſent we do not much care; Neither do we here undertake to determine this
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:169706:81"/>
Controverſie, ſeing that the Animal faculty doth exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his function both waies, from the ſame cauſes, and that the ſecondary vice doth happen by this affect in the Animal Conſtitution almoſt after the ſame manner. For firſt, as for the generation of the Animal Spirits, whether the former or the latter opinion be true, it wil be all one; becauſ we find no fault in the Brain (unleſs perhaps ſome other Diſeaſ be conjoyned) wherin each opinion ſuppoſeth the Animal Spirits to be generated. For we have ſhewed above that the Head ought not to be numbred among the firſt affected Parts, and that the internal and proper actions therof are not viciated in this Diſeaſ. Then ſecondly, As for the deſtribution of the Animal Spirits, whether it be perfected backwards and forwards by that rapid and ſudden motion like lightning, or by a motion only made forwards and that too gentle and ſlow, commonly the ſame fault occurreth in this Diſeaſ.</p>
            <p>For firſt, Seing that that ſuppoſed rapid motion of the Animal Spirits is cauſed by their paſſage into the firſt affected Parts, namely, through the Spinal Martow without the Skul, through the Nerves from thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, and through the parts into which thoſe Nervs are deſtributed; and ſeing that all theſe parts in this affect do labor with a cold diſtemper, with a paucity and dulneſs of inherent Spirits, the due ſwiftneſs of that motion muſt needs be ſomwhat retarded. For a cold di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, as alſo a benummedneſs and penury of Spirits are repugnant to any motion, excepting a conſtrictive; ſome may ſay that the opinion propounded in the firſt place doth ſuppoſe a wonderful activity and ſubtilty of the Animal Spirits, wherby they can eaſily overcome this repugnance. But, however it may be, ſeing that the parts react through which the Spirits have their paſſage,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:169706:82"/>
and labor to communicate their coldneſs and dulneſs to them, they muſt needs in ſome degree retard that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Spirits, leſſen their ſubtilty, and ſomwhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept that expedite tranſition. Wherfore this opinion being ſuppoſed as true, the Animal Conſtitution will be viciated in this affect, in regard of the retundation of that motion of the Spirits. And that ſecondarily, ſeing that this motion is not interrupted by the primary fault of the Animal Spirits, but by the fault of the firſt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Parts, as hath been ſaid in like manner in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion laſt propoſed, wherin the motion of the Spirits is ſuppoſed to be peaceable and gentle, they muſt needs whilſt they are ſomwhat ſlowly tranſmitted through the firſt affected parts, contract ſome vicioſity from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved inherent Conſtitution of thoſe parts, for the ſame Reaſons which we alleaged in the Queſtion imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly preceding. It will be therfore according to this Opinion alſo, a Secondary vice in the deſtribution of the Animal Spirits,</p>
            <p>Again, As for the Tenſity of the very ſubſtance of the Brain, of the Spinal Marrow of the Nerves and the Nervous parts in time of waking, which is ſuppoſed in the latter Opinion before propounded, there muſt needs be ſome defect of a due Tenſity in the Spinal Marrow without the Skull, in the Nerves ariſing from thence, and in the parts unto which they are deſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For firſt, A cold and moiſt diſtemper is repugnant and adverſ to that due Tenſitiy, ſo alſo is that dulneſs and penury of inherent Spirits; wherwith the Parts are without controverſie rendred ſlothful, and leſs apt to perform the Animal Actions; the contrary wherof hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth, when the aforeſaid parts obtain their due Tenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Secondly, It is manifeſt by what hath been ſaid, that the Tone of theſe parts is ſomwhat viciated in this
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:169706:82"/>
affect, by reaſon of their exceeding looſneſs, ſlipperineſs, ſoftneſs, weakneſs and internal lubricity, which qualities do moſt evidently enfeeble the juſt Tenſity of the ſaid Parts. Although therfore that the Brain in this affect do for his part yield a due and juſt influx, yet it is ſcarce poſſible, nay it is altogether impoſſible, that it ſhould communicate that Tenſity in a ſufficient degree to to the Spinal Marrow without the Skull, to the Nerves from thence proceeding &amp;c. becauſe of the diſtemper, benummedneſs and penury of the inherent Spirirs. Thirdly, The Symptoms in this Diſeaſ that relate to the Animal faculty do moſt clearly confirm the ſame thing. For Children afflicted with this Diſeaſ do from the very beginning therof (if they be compared with others of the ſame age) move and exerciſe themſelves very weakly, and are leſs delighted in manly ſports: but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the progreſs of the affect, they are averſ from any vehement motion, as they ſtand upon their feet, they reel, wave, and ſtagger, ſeeking after ſomwhat to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them, and can ſcarce go upright; neither take they pleaſure in any play unleſs ſitting or lying along, or when they are carried in their Nurſes Arms: Finally the weak Spine is ſcarce ſtrong enough to bear the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the Head, the Body being ſo extreamly extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated and pined away. All which things do abundantly demonſtrate that the Tenſity of the parts ſubſervient to motion is leſs rigid in this affect than is juſtly requiſite in time of waking. If therfore that due Tenſity in time of waking be a part of the Animal Conſtitution, which we here ſuppoſe, that being viciated muſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt neceſſarily conſtitute a Diſeaſ in the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Conſtitution; and ſeing that this fault hath no primary dependance upon the Brain it ſelf, but upon the inherent Conſtitution of the firſt affected parts, it
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:169706:83"/>
ought in all Reaſon to be reputed a Secondary fault in reſpect of the Animal Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>Yet here we meet with a ſcruple. Som may demand, <hi>Why the ſenſ as well as the faculty of motion is not viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in this affect?</hi> The reaſon is plain, a far greater tenſity, ſtrength and vigor of the Nervs is required to exerciſe the motive then the ſenſitive faculty. For almoſt the gentleſt motion of the Nervs is ſufficient for ſenſe; but not for motion. So you may obſerve in the motion of any Joynt, that the Muſcles which move it are very hard and ſtiff, but that hardneſs being remitted, yet the ſenſation is eaſily performed. Nor doth that any way hinder, becauſe that ſomtimes in the Palſy the ſenſe is ſomwhat ſtupified, and the motion remaineth: for the Palſy is an affect very different from this; for in that the primary fault reſides in the very Animal Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, therfore it may ſo fal out, that both the ſenſe and the motion may be equally affected. Beſides, when perhaps one Nerve doth want the du influx of the Brain, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is extended to the muſcles of that part doth enjoy it, it may be, that for this cauſe alſo the ſenſe may be aboliſhed, and yet the motion may continu; although this caſe is not ſo frequent, and that the motion is more uſually taken away, the ſenſe remaining. But we have ſaid enough concerning this matter. And thus at length we have produced thoſe things which we have meditated of the integral Eſſence, both primary and ſecondary of this Diſeaſ; and that with as much perſpicuity as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo difficult and unſearcht into, would bear: In the next place we ſhal addreſs our ſelvs to the examination of the cauſes of this Diſeaſ.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XV. The Cauſes of the <hi>Rachites.</hi> And firſt thoſe things which concern the Parents.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have largely explained above both the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary and Secondary Eſſence of this Diſeaſe. And indeed we have ſufficiently demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſame place, the dependance of the ſecondary upon the Primary Eſſence. It may not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be here expected, that we ſhould again purpoſely and in particular diſcuſs the cauſes of the ſecondary Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, which we have handled before. It may ſuffice that we have found out the cauſes of the ſecondary Eſſence. Yet if any cauſe do occur which at once<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath an influx as wel into the primary or ſecondary Eſſence of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſ, we ſhal not refuſe to take notice of it, by the way as we proceed.</p>
            <p>But omitting al diligent ſearch into the ſeveral kinds of cauſes, we purpoſe to contract this our diſcourſ chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to two heads. The former containeth the Infirmities and the diſeaſed diſpoſitions of the Parents, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have ſo great an influence upon the Children, that they ſuppeditate, at leaſt a proneſs to this affect, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer an aptitude to fal into it, if they have not actually fallen into it from their very birth. The latter compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth the acceſſary cauſes of this Diſeaſ; namly, thoſe which happen to children after their birth.</p>
            <p>Concerning the cauſes of the firſt kind we meet with a Queſtion at the firſt entrance: <hi>How and whether this Diſeaſ may be ſaid to be hereditary?</hi> That we may the more ſuccesfully proceed in the determination of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:169706:84"/>
this queſtion, an hereditary Diſeaſ muſt be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into that properly, and that improperly ſo called. And indeed an hereditary Diſeaſ properly ſo called, is ever ſuppoſed to be preexiſtent in both or one of the Parents, and from thence to be derived to the Progeny. But an hereditary Diſeaſ improperly ſo called, is not ſuppoſed to be preexiſtent in the ſame kind, either in both or one of the Parents; yet the ſame fault muſt always neceſſarily precede (perhaps altogether of a different kind) at leaſt in one of them, by vertu wherof a certain diſpoſedneſs is imprinted in the children, wherby they are made obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious to fal into this improperly hereditary Diſeaſ.</p>
            <p>Moreover, An hereditary Diſeaſ properly ſo called, is twofold; either in the conformation, as when a lame Perſon begets a lame; a deaf Father, a deaf Son, or a blind a blind; or in the ſimilary Conſtitution: as when a Gowty Father begets a Gowty Child. It is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that in the firſt kind, ther is an hereditary fault in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in the firſt affected parts of the Conformation. But in the latter, there is no neceſſity that a Diſeaſ of the ſame kind with the Diſeaſ of the Parents, ſhould be actually inherent in the <hi>Embryon,</hi> from the firſt forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But ſuch a diſpoſition imprinted by one or both of the Parents is ſufficient, which as the life is lengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned may be actuated into the ſame, by the concourſ of other intervening cauſes. Again, an hereditary Diſeaſ improperly ſo called, may be likewiſe twofold; namely, either in the Conformation, or in the ſimilary Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. In the formation, as when neither of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents is blind, pore-blind, lame, &amp;c. yet have begotten a Son blind, pore-blind, or lame, by the very fault of the formation. For in theſe caſes, that very fault which is ſenſible and conſpicuous in the Iſſu, flowed from ſom fault in the Parents, although perhaps of a different
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:169706:84"/>
kind, and ſo it may be called, though improperly an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Diſeaſ. In like manner in the ſimilary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Iſſu, there may reſide an hereditary Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſ improperly ſo called, as when a Melancholy, ſeden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, or an intemperate Parent, begetteth a Child ſubject to the gowt, or the <hi>Cachexia,</hi> although perhaps the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent was never troubled either with the one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being thus premiſed, we approach neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the reſolving of the Queſtion. And firſt, we affirm that this Diſeaſ is not comprehended under the former ſpecies of an hereditary Diſeaſ, properly ſo called. For that conſiſteth in the formation: but this Diſeaſ accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its primary Eſſence, is a ſimilary Diſeaſ, as we have before demonſtrated, and very rarely bewrayeth it ſelf from the very Birth, much leſs from the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and formation. And for the ſame Reaſons, we alſo affirm this Diſeaſ belongeth not to the former kind of herditary Diſeaſes improperly ſo called. Which after a like manner conſiſt in the formation of the parts, and are begun preſently after the firſt formation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We ſay, that ſo it may com to paſs, that this Diſeaſ may fall under the ſecond ſpecies ptopounded, of an hereditary Diſeaſe properly ſo called; namely, that which conſiſteth in the ſimilary Conſtitution. Yet we cannot affirm this as certain and undubitable, becauſ the Children which we have hitherto known to be afflicted with this Diſeaſ, have not lived to ſuch maturity of years as to beget Children: and therefore we cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſuppoſe, then by probable conjecture, whether or no their progeny ſhould be infected with this affect, as it were by right of inheritance.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We ſay, that in many Children this Diſeaſ doth directly fal under the ſecond ſpecies of an heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:169706:85"/>
Diſeaſ improperly ſo called. For according to the primary Eſſence of it is a ſimilary Diſeaſ, and although it hath not yet been ſo long and ſufficiently diſcovered unto us, that we can determin the effects of it, how they wil operate in the Progeny, yet frequently in the preſent progeny we have obſerved certain Rudiments of this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to have been derived to many from one or both of the Parents. So that although neither of the Parents were in their infancy or child-hood afflicted with this Diſeaſ, yet ſom proneſs and diſpoſedneſs to this Diſeaſ hath preſently appeared in their little Infants, eſpecially in thoſe whoſe Parents before coition were prediſpoſed by ſom vitioſity of body, or error of life, to tranſmit this pollution to their Iſſu; but thoſe defilements of the Parents which diſpoſe them to propagate Children ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to this affect, we ſhal by and by reckon up, in their order; from whence alſo a higher confirmation of this aſſertion may be deduced.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, We ſay, although the affects of the Parents do frequently imprint a certain propenſion in the Iſſue, to fal into this Diſeaſ, ſo that this Diſeaſ may be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reputed in the ſecond acception of an hereditary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſ, improperly ſo called; yet it very rarely happneth that this Diſeaſ doth actually break out before the birth of the child. One amongſt us atteſteth, that once, and only but once, he ſaw a Child new born invaded with this Diſeaſ. And in this Child the Back-bone, and the neck were ſo weak, that they could not ſuſtain the weight and greatneſs of the Head, within three months after it was born, the Child dyed. Wherby it is apparent that he was grievouſly affected. It ſeemeth conſpicuous by what hath been ſaid, that Infants, however they may fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently borrow from their Parents a diſpoſedneſs to this affect, are moſt rarely and ſeldom troubled with it
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:169706:85"/>
before they are born, but if at any time they are ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maturely afflicted, that then the affect is moſt vehement and grievous. Now a reaſon of the event of both theſe may be demanded. To the former therefore we ſay, that this Diſeaſ doth partly conſiſt in a cold diſtemper of the firſt affected parts, and indeed an unequal one, as namly, being very cold in the ſaid parts, reſpect being had to the temper of the Head, and the Bowels: and that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon that unequal coldneſs of thoſe parts, is of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Diſeaſ, and that alſo in reſpect of the very inequallity. For this contributeth much to that unequal and deficient diſtribution of the Vital Blood to the parts firſt affected. Seing therfore at ſuch time when the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryon</hi> is carried in the womb, this inequallity of the temperament of the firſt affected parts may be much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and averted by an equal heat, wherby the womb may on every ſide embrace, and cheriſh the body of the <hi>Embryon,</hi> it followeth that the geſtation doth very much drive away this Diſeaſ, at leaſt retard the invaſion of it. For the body of the Womb being all about equally war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with an even heat, and equally embracing and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing al the parts of the <hi>Embryon,</hi> doth not eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit one part to wax colder then the reſt, and by that means to be cheriſhed with a defective and ſparing afflux of the Vital Blood. Wherfore ſeing that that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equallity of heat and comfort, are Eſſential parts of this Diſeaſ, and without which this Diſeaſ cannot conſiſt, it is no wonder that the womb ſtrongly reſiſting theſe parts of the Diſeaſ, and the invaſion therof, doth for the moſt part protract it, at leaſt during the impregnation.</p>
            <p>As for the latter part of the queſtion propounded, nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Why Infants, who before their birth were infeſted with this Diſeaſ, are more grievouſly and dangerouſly affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted?</hi> We ſay, according to that <hi>Aphoriſm</hi> of <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:169706:86"/>
that a Diſeaſ which holdeth the leaſt congruity with the condition of the Diſeaſed, is more dangerous then the contrary; as a Feaver threatneth more danger to an old man, than to a yong, and in the winter, then the ſummer. For a Diſeaſ that hath ſom correſpondence &amp; conformity with the condition of the Diſeaſed, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a ſlighter cauſ for its introduction: but that which is contrary therunto argueth the magnitude of the cauſ, which notwithſtanding reſiſtance, and oppoſition, will produce his effects. In the preſent Diſeaſ therfore if the equal and impartial heat of the womb cannot reſtrain the propenſity of the <hi>Embryon</hi> to this affect, but it wil fal into it, ſom vehement cauſe muſt needs be imprinted by the Parents, and the ſeminal Principals extreamly weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Therfore there is little hope when the <hi>Embryon</hi> laboring with this Diſeaſ is born, neither wil a prudent Phyſitian attempt the cure without ſom Prognoſtick of imminent danger. Moreover, inſtead of a <hi>Corallary,</hi> we ſubſtitute another Rule, having ſom affinity with the former, although perhaps it be not yet certain and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; namly, that Children by how much the ſooner after their birth they are invaded with this Diſeaſ, ſo much the more difficulty <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> are they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from it. And let theſe things ſuffice concerning the Queſtion propounded.</p>
            <p>We wil now apply our ſelvs to the diviſion and recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning up of thoſe cauſes which on the Parents parts may produce this Diſeaſ. Som of theſe faults in the Parents relate to the Generation of the ſeed, wherof the <hi>Embry</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſiſteth, others have reference to the <hi>Embryon</hi> now conceived, and yet born about in the Womb. The faults of the Generation of the ſeed proceed either from the man or the woman, or from the whole Body, or from thoſe parts onely which are dedicated
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:169706:86"/>
by nature to Generation. The faults of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents depending upon the whole Body have the ſtrongeſt influence into the Child, becauſe it tranſmitteth ſuch matter to the Generation of the Seed, as is unapt for thoſe parts dedicated to that office. We purpoſe not here to particularize the ſeveral faults of the matter of the Seed, but to inſtance in thoſe alone, which conſpire to entitle the Progeny to this Diſeaſ. Theſe we reduce to four Claſſes.</p>
            <p>The firſt Claſſis containeth a cold and moiſt diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the matter, wherof the Seed is Generated. This chiefly reſulteth from a cold and moiſt diſtemper of the Parents, unto which we alſo refer a predominancy of il juice, eſpecially that which is <hi>Phlegmatick</hi> and wateriſh alſo a <hi>Cachexia,</hi> and <hi>Dropſy,</hi> and perhaps the Green-Sickneſs, which ſom cal the white Feaver, not ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubdued before conception; al which affects manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly help to conſtitute a wateriſh matter, both cold and moiſt in the Genital Parts, which is not only in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral leſs apt for the Generation of the Seed, but it parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly inclineth to a condition of this Diſeaſ; a part of whoſe primary Eſſence conſiſteth in that very cold and moiſt diſtemper, as we have already proved. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, we may perhaps hither reduce the Scurvy, the <hi>French Pox,</hi> &amp; the Jaundice, in which affects the Blood alſo is polluted with filthy excrementitious humors, and corrupt exulcerations, which cannot eaſily be changed into laudable and fruitful Seed.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Claſſis containeth containeth the penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Natural Spirits, wherby the good Seed ſhould be Generated. For a Spirituous Seed cannot flow from ſuch a kind of matter. The cauſes which ſuppeditate that impure matter to the Parts of Generation are the dried and extenuated Bodies of the Parents, waſted either by
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:169706:87"/>
long abſtinence, or by ſom vehement evacuation, as by vomits, lasks, Lienteries, Dyſenteries, Hepatical Flur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of long continuance; by an exceſſive <hi>Hemorrhage</hi> from any part, by violent ſweatings, or any Chronical Diſeaſes, which waſteth the ſtrength and is not repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before Coition eſpecially, a Conſumption, a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick Feaver, an indigeſtion from any kind of Cauſ. Laſtly, from a defective and imperfect Concoction of the laſt aliment, or the fault of any part. For in ſuch caſes the matter which is ſeparated to the parts ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to Generation, is deſtitute of a competent plenty of Natural Spirits, wherupon the Parts preparing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocting the Seed cannot perfectly correct this defect, and ejaculate ſuch Seed as is ſufficiently abounding with Spirits. Seing therfore that a conſiderable part of this Diſeaſ conſiſteth in the paucity of Natural Spirits, it cannot otherwiſe be, but that the iſſue propagated by ſuch a crude and almoſt Spiritleſs Seed, ſhould be tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a certain Natural Propenſion to this affect, even in their firſt rudiments, which afterwards upon the concurrence or other cauſes, is eaſily deduced into Act.</p>
            <p>The third Claſſis containeth the benummedneſs or ſtupour of the matter tranſmitted to the Generative Parts, wherof the Seed is produced. For not only the ſolid parts, but alſo the whol Maſs of Blood, and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors therin contained are obnoxious to that ſame ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour. And from hence it is that Phyſitians being to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cauſes of Diſeaſes, do uſe to ſay, that the humors and alſo the Blood are too fluid and moveable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duly vehement; ſomtimes on the contrary that they are unapt for motion, leſs fluxible, and unactive beneath a Mediocrity, &amp; in reſpect of this thing alſo a certain Mene is moſt wholſom: but more things relating hither may be ſeen above. We will here only proſecute thoſe faults
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:169706:87"/>
of the Parents from whence this defect of vigor and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctivity in the matter of the Seed doth ariſe. Theſe therfore are firſt the foſt, looſ, and effeminate Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of either or both the Parents, indiſpoſed to ſtrong and Maſculine exerciſes. Secondly, an overmoiſt and full diet and epicuriſon, obnoxious to frequent crudities. Thirdly, A delicate kind of life abandoned to eaſ and voluptuouſneſs, ſlothful, and rarely accuſtomed to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, danger, and care. Hither you may alſo refer a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal defect of manly Exerciſe immoderate ſleep, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoon after mate, and any kind of ſleepings whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, a ſedentary, ſpeculative life, intent upon ſoft and queint Arts and Sciences, as Poetry, Muſick, and the like, to theſe may be further added a dayly frequenting of Comedies and other Plays, an aſſiduous reading of Fables, and Romances, and inſtead of manly and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Recreations, a looſ expence of time in Carding and Dicing. Hither alſo belong the neverfailing fruits of a laſting peace and plenty, ſuch as ſecurity, indiligence and the like. All theſe enumerated faults do manifeſtly contribute a ſhare to introduce a lazineſs and Effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nateneſs in the parts. Seing therfore that the Blood, together with the humors contained in it, doth in its circulation waſh all thoſe ſtupified parts, it cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe be, but that as it glideth along it muſt partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate ſome ſuch alteration; and ſeing that ſome porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the tranſient Blood affected with this ſtupefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is tranſmitted to the Generative Parts, with the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry matter wherof the Seed is Generated, it is eaſie to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that that Child which ſpringeth from ſuch princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals muſt inwardly contract at leaſt ſome propenſion conformable to the ſluggiſhneſs, and ſtupour of its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive matter, and that that propenſion, after-Birth when the preſervation is taken away by the equal cheriſhings
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:169706:88"/>
of the Womb, is by divers cauſes without difficulty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into act, wherfore ſeing that ſuch a dulneſs is a part of the Primary Eſſence of this Diſeaſ, it followeth that in ſuch vitiated principals there lurketh a propenſity to this affect, derived from one or both of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Claſſis containeth the vicious Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (if any ſuch occur) of the Parents, who in their Childhood were infected with this Diſeaſ. For theſe would tranſmit into the Children a continuation of an hereditary Diſeaſ properly ſo called. But becauſe, as we have ſaid, it is not yet manifeſt whether the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent afflicted with this Diſeaſ in their infancy ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get children therewith affected; beſides, becauſ the faults of the Parents may be conveniently referred to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one of theſe Claſſes aforeſaid, or to many, or indeed to all of them, it will be fruitleſs to inſiſt longer upon them. Therfore having reckoned up the faults of the Parents which depend upon the whol Body, in the next place we proceed to their faults which peculiarly reſide in the Genital Parts.</p>
            <p>Theſe faults are ſomtimes a cold diſtemper, ſomtimes a moiſt, when by reaſon of too much humidity they are looſned or weakned, wherupon they ejaculate either an unfruitful deed or ſuch as is propenſe to this Diſeaſ, ſomtimes thoſe parts are infeſted with a virulent, vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or wateriſh <hi>Gonorrhea,</hi> and they excern a Seed not ſufficiently elaborated; the ſame muſt be ſaid of the white and red Fluxes of Women. Again, ſome things outwardly applied to thoſe parts have reference hither; as Ointments of Hemlock and other <hi>Narcotical</hi> things, eſpecially if they be often anointed with them, in like manner Oyntments that are incorporated with white or red Lead, Chalk of Lead, Litharge, Sugar of Saturn
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:169706:88"/>
and the like, dayly and for a long time adhibited to thoſe parts. For ſuch as theſe blunt the activity of the inherent Spirits in thoſe Parts, and introduce a certain dulneſs in them, which being communicated to the Seed prepared in them diſpoſeth the progeny to this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
            <p>At length we have finiſhed our intended enumerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if not of all, yet at leaſt of all the moſt principal cauſes which happen before Conception about the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the prolificative Seed, and have any concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to produce this Diſeaſ, or to diſpoſe to the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction therof. Now follow the faults and errors of the Mother in the time ſhe beareth the Embryon in her Womb, which alſo muſt be reputed among the cauſes of this Diſeaſ before the Birth.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There hapneth a cold and moiſt diſtemper of the Womb it ſelf, which (as were we ſilent is eaſily ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to every one) may moſt readily be communicated to the Embryon by the perpetual contact of the Womb.</p>
            <p>In the Second place, All thoſe things offer themſelves which ſuppeditate to the Embryon crude and impure Juyces converted by excrementions and corrupt humors inſtead of laudable aliment. Hitherto principally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth the unwholſom and prepoſterous diet of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with Child, eſpecially inclining to moiſture, cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the heaping together of crudities. The ſame things alſo happen by the imperfection and defect of the firſt or ſecond Concoction, eſpecially when they are not excerned by vomit or ſome other evacuation of the Crudities from thence proceeding, but are at length tranſmitted with the Mothers Blood for the aliment of the Embryon. Beſides, if a moiſt and cold Diſeaſ, as a cold and moiſt diſtemper with the matter, an ill di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:169706:89"/>
a <hi>Cachexia</hi> or Dropſy, &amp;c. do invade a woman with Child after Conception, it may thereupon eaſily happen, that the impure aliment alſo, which nouriſheth and cheriſheth the Seeds of this Diſeaſ, be diſpenſed to the <hi>Embryon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the third place are to be reckoned al thoſe things that defraud the <hi>Embryon</hi> of du aliment, as any exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive evacuation, eſpecially a laſhing flux of Blood in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part; alſo a raſh opening of a Vein, or <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> that exceeds in quantity. The ſuckling of another child may alſo divert the afflux of ſufficient aliment from the Womb towards the Breaſts. Hitherto likewiſe belongeth inordinate faſting, or any indigeſtion in the Mother, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inappetency after meat, or defect of concoction. Moreover, <hi>an acute Feaver hapning to a woman with Child,</hi> beſides other inconveniences, may alſo defraud the Child of du aliment; ſo alſo an Hectick Feaver. All theſe things do not only infer to the <hi>Embryon,</hi> a dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Vital Spirits, and a defective nouriſhment, but alſo they cauſe a want of natural Spirits. For the Naturall Spirits are waſted and diſſipated without due nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and are alſo deſtitute and diſappointed of neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reparation. Seing therfore that a part of the Eſſence of this Diſeaſ conſiſteth in the defect of Natural Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ſom diſpoſition to this affect muſt need be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed to the off-ſpring from the cauſes aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. &amp; laſtly, exceſſive ſleepines of women with child, ſlothfulneſs, eaſ, any vehement labor and exerciſe after Conception, do alſo contribute their ſhare. For although violent motions and actions of any kind are forbidden to women in ſuch cauſes; yet moderate labors, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and exerciſes which offer no violence to the womb, or provoke to abortiveneſs, do not only conduce to the health of the Mother, but in ſom degree they drive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:169706:89"/>
that dulneſs from the <hi>Embryon,</hi> and augment the heat, vigor and activity of it. And thus we put an end to the firſt Chapter of the cauſes of this Diſeaſ before the Birth. Thoſe which happen after the birth ſhall be the ſubject of our next examination.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XVI. The Cauſes of this Diſeaſ incident to Children after their birth.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have noted in the precedent Chapter, that Infants from their firſt Origin are ſeldom af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with this Diſeaſ, but by reaſon of the Cauſes there rehearſed, that they are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently affected with a natural diſpoſedneſs, and propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the ſame. We ſhal now proſecute thoſe cauſes which are apt to actuate that Natural diſpoſition after the birth, or newly and fully to produce this Diſeaſ. For it muſt be known that the ſame cauſes which may actuat that prediſpoſedneſs to this Diſeaſ, may produce this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſ a new, if they be ſufficiently intenſive in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. And therfore we confeſs that thoſe children which are prone to this Diſeaſ from their Nativity are eaſily affected; but that other which are free from al Natural corruption fall not into the ſame but upon more potent cauſes; and yet thoſe cauſes are the ſame for their kind and differ only in the degree. We therfore thought it needleſs to ſpeak of theſe things diſtinctly and apart: it
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:169706:90"/>
may ſuffice that we have ſpoken of them indeſcriminate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and together.</p>
            <p>At the very entrance a Queſtion there is which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunes a Reſolution; namely, Whether Contagion may be numbred among the cauſes of this Diſeaſ, and therfore whether this Diſeaſ in a proper and right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding be a contagious Diſeaſ, indeed he that conſidereth this Diſeaſ unknown to the Ancients, how it firſt invaded the Weſtern Parts of <hi>England,</hi> and in few years hath been ſince diſperſed all <hi>England</hi> over, will at the firſt thought eaſily judg it to be contagious, and to have been ſpread ſo far and wide by the infection of it. But the matter will ſeem to be otherwiſe to him that will conſider it more intentively, For although this Diſeaſ may in ſome manner endeavor to imprint an affection like unto it ſelf in other Bodies, yet it ſcarce advanceth ſo far that it can totally produce a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſ of the ſame kind. For perhaps it may in one ſome ſlight inclination in another Body, yea, ſomtimes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may accelerate or haſten the invaſion of an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in a Body highly prediſpoſed unto it, yet it cannot therfore deſerve the Name of a Diſeaſ properly conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious. For all Diſeaſes conſpire to change and aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late thoſe Bodies which are neereſt to themſelves, yet that is not ſufficient to denominate Diſeaſes contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. For to conſtitute a contagious Diſeaſ properly ſo called it is further required that out of it ſelf it propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate a certain Seminal fermentation of it ſelf, which ſecretly inſinuating it ſelf into other Bodies, may by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees introduce into thoſe Bodies a Diſeaſ of the ſame Species. But this Diſeaſ containeth no ſuch fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in its eſſence, neither is it ſecretly propagated by a precedent emiſſion of Seed from it ſelf which may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print a Diſeaſ of the ſame Species in the adjacent Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:169706:90"/>
For we have already often ſaid, That the firſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of this Diſeaſ conſiſteth in a cold and moiſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, and in a dulneſs and paucity of inherent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which affections if they endeavor to aſſimilate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Bodies that are neer them, they attempt and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it by open violence, and not by ſnares and fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or a preimmiſſion of ſecret little fires. In like manner if you reflect upon the Secondary Eſſence ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, neither the viciated Tone, nor the depraved Vital nor Animal Function, nor the Organical faults are found apt and fit in this affect to inſinuate themſelves into other Bodies, and to propagate their own Species. Finally, if we will conſult experience, the matter will quickly be vindicated from all doubt. For we frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerve Children either of the ſame age, or very neer to the ſame age, be brought up in the ſame Houſe, wherof one or other of them is perhaps afflicted with this Diſeaſ, whilſt a third or many amongſt them do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape it. Yea, We have known Children not only edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated under one common Roof, and delighting in the continual and mutual ſociety of one another, but day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meeting at one Board and lying together in one Bed; wherof one who hath been ill affected with this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſ hath not infected any of his companions either by feeding or lying together. Which could ſcarce poſſibly happen in a Diſeaſ properly contagious. Wherfore Contagion being excluded from the Catalogue of this Diſeaſ, we will addreſs our ſelves to the finding out of ſuch as are more true and unqueſtionable. We divide the cauſes which produce this Diſeaſ after Birth into two Claſſes. The firſt containeth the errors which procure it in the uſe of the ſix nonnatural things. The latter comprehendeth the precedent Diſeaſes of divers kinds, which are wont very often to leave behind
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:169706:91"/>
them ſome Inclination to this affect.</p>
            <p>As for the former Claſſis concerning the abuſe of the ſix non-Natural things, ſo far as they relate to this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſ, ſeing that children are ſeldom diſcompoſed with any vehement paſſions of the mind, and can thereupon very difficultly fal into this Diſeaſ. Again, in regard that the uſe of Venery appertaineth not unto them; we wil reduce and limit theſe caſes to the five ſubſequent heads. To the Air, alſo to what things ſoever extrinſecally oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, or are applyed to the body, to meat and drink, and ſuch things as are inwardly received, to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reſt, to the kind and manner of life, to actions and exerciſe, to ſleep and watching; laſtly, thoſe things which are preternaturally retained in, or ſevered from the body. Theſe ſeveral things we ſhal examine in the propounded order with al convenient brevity.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the Air and ſuch things, as happen outwardly.</head>
               <p>A cold and moiſt Air doth powerfully contribute to this Diſeaſ. For ſeing that it doth more eaſily ſteal into the external and firſt affected parts in this Diſeaſ, then into the hidden and fenced bowels, it directly helpeth to imprint in thoſe parts that unequal; namely, that cold and moiſt diſtemper. The conſtitution of this kind of Air, is chiefly predominant about the beginning of the Spring, at which time the Nurſes ought to be cautious and circumſpect. How they too confidently expoſe their children, which are ſubject to this affect, to the injuries of the Air; as alſo when the Air is cloudy, thick, rainy, and ful of vaporous exhalations. Hereupon places neer the Sea, great Mariſhes that are obnoxious to much rain and ſhowers, and fed with a great number of Springs, are wont to be <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> very fruitful of this affect.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:169706:91"/>
In like manner houſes neer the banks of great Rivers and Ponds or Meers are for this purpoſe condemned. Moreover, frequent bathing and waſhings with ſweet water, although they be applied actually hot, yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that they are potentially cold and moiſt, they are alſo juſtly culpable; for they do in ſom ſort communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their diſtemper unto the parts whereunto they are adhibited, and more or leſs cauſ a ſoftneſs and looſneſs in thoſe parts, and make the circulation of the Blood too ſlippery.</p>
               <p>Hither we may alſo refer cold and moiſt liniments, as alſo ſuch as are looſe and ſlippery, being too often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in that tender age, eſpecially about the Spine or the Origin of the Nervs: laſtly, ſoft linnen cloaths, if they be not wel dried, they cheriſh the roots of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſ. For this cauſ amongſt others, it hapneth that the Children of poor people are the leſs obnoxious to this Diſeaſ, becauſe namely, for the moſt part they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrapped in courſe cloaths, and woolly integuments, each of which doth rub and tickle the parts thereby exciting and augmenting the inward heat, and irritating a more copious afflux of the Vital Blood unto the habit of the Body, and are therefore very effectual to baniſh this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſ. But the ſoftned fine linnen doth neither irritate the heat into the external parts, nor laudably cheriſh it. For if they chance to be for ſom ſhort ſpace of time removed from the touch of the parts, they preſently looſe their warmth, and at the next touch they conveigh a ſenſe of coldneſs into the parts. Wherefore ſuch linnen cloaths being in the number of thoſe things which are dedicated only to extrinſecal application, and ſeing that they are hurtful by their ſole coldnes &amp; ſoftneſs, we have referred them to this firſt Claſſes of cauſes, &amp; the firſt part therof
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:169706:92"/>
which containeth cold and moiſt things outwardly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place the Air being infected with any particular infection, as noxious Metalline exhalations, which for the moſt part ſight againſt the inherent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the parts, by a kind of venemous malignity, and do either extinguiſh them, or drive away and diſſipate them; withal they diſſolve the Bone of the parts, and the pulſificative force, eſpecially in the parts external, where they firſt happen, they at leaſt diminiſh, if they do not weaken it, and affect it with a languidneſs. Theſe things are principally cauſed by exhalations from Lead, Antimony, Quick-ſilver, and the like. Moreover, oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made of the ſame, are almoſt alike perillous, if the firſt affected parts be frequently and unſeaſonably anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therewith; although perhaps theſe things do alſo belong to the fouth title of this Claſſis. Finally, we have obſerved ſom Children who have been anointed with <hi>Mercurial</hi> Unctions for the Scabs, to have fallen after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards into this Diſeaſ.</p>
               <p>In the third place an Air vehemently hot and ſubtle, extreamly attenuant and diſſolvent, may likewiſe be numbred among the cauſes of this Diſeaſ, becauſe it allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth forth, diſſipateth and conſumeth the inherent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. In like manner hot liniments and eſpecially diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive withal, Chymical oils diſtilled and not ſufficiently corrected by the commixture of things temperate; for theſe in ſuch a tender conſtitution of the parts do eaſily melt and reſolve the Spirits into a volatile and Airy thinneſs, and by conſequence infer a penury of Inherent Spirits. Hither alſo belong ſharp, ſaltiſh, hot and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſive Baths, eſpecially, if they be unſeaſonably and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurably uſed, for theſe no leſs then the former do waſt and conſume the Spirits.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:169706:92"/>
Fourthly and laſtly, An Air filled with <hi>Narotical</hi> vapors or exhalations, and baths, fomentations and <hi>Liniments</hi> made of <hi>Soporiferous</hi> and <hi>Narotical</hi> ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, as Hemlock, Henbane, Opium, Nightſhade, and the like, and externally applied, are very fitly reducible, alſo to this Claſſis. For they eaſily introduce a benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medneſs into the firſt affected Parts, into which they firſt conveigh their force. Which benummedneſs is not only it ſelf a part of the firſt Eſſence of this Diſeaſ, but it alſo eaſily dulleth and diminiſheth the Vital in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux in thoſe parts, and conſequently is alſo a cauſ of that part of the Secondary Eſſence of this Diſeaſ, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in the Vital Conſtitution, which thing we have already explained more at large. And thus much of things outwardly occurring.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="part">
               <head>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Of Meat and Drink, and things inwardly taken.</head>
               <p>To this Title there belong firſt aliments of any kind which are too moiſt and cold, for theſe things manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cheriſh the diſtemper, wherin a part of the Eſſence of this conſiſteth. Hither therfore we refer moſt kind of Fiſh, and crude Meats which are not well prepared by Coition; alſo all thoſe things whatſoever they be which cauſ a defect of concoction in the Ventricle. Therfore the feeding upon new Meat, before the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Aliment is concocted, is very hurtful for Children diſpoſed to this affect; and in this reſpect, a plentiful Diet is altogether to be abandoned, and a thin ſpare Diet ought to be obſerved, for too liberal feeding doth overwhelm and choak the heat, and therfore muſt needs accumulate many crude and raw humors. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps this one may be reputed among the eſpecial cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:169706:93"/>
why this Diſeaſ doth more frequently invade the Cradles of the rich; then afflict poor mens Children. In like manner cold &amp; moiſt Medicines taken inwardly, and alſo ſuch as are laxative, and endued with an internal ſlipperineſs, do manifeſtly relate hither. For theſe things do not only infer a like diſtemper, but they produce a <hi>Relaxation</hi> in the <hi>Tone</hi> of the parts, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect them with an internal ſlipperineſs, and in a word they render the current of the Blood through the firſt affected parts over ſlippery and eaſie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Nouriſhments that are too thick, viſcous and obſtructive belong hither, eſpecially becauſ they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt the equal diſtribution of the Blood. Hither we refer fleſh hardned with ſmoke, and ſeaſoned with much Salt; in like manner Salt Fiſh, and Cheeſe almoſt of any kind plentifully fed on. Bread newly taken out of the Oven, and not yet cold; alſo almoſt all ſweet things condited with Sugar, unleſs they are withal tempered with Wine, or cutting, or attenuant. Obſtructive Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines likewiſe of any kind belong hither, unto which we may further ad ſuch as are <hi>Partotical,</hi> and whatſoever being drank induce a benummedneſs into the parts.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Nouriſhments that are of an extream hot and biting quality, ſharp, &amp; corroſive, as old &amp; ſtrong Wines, eſpecially being drank upon an empty Stomach, Meats alſo that are ſeaſoned with much Pepper and aromatical Sawces, muſt be connumerated among the reputed cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of this affect, For theſe things in ſuch a tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of the Parts, do eaſily feed upon and devour the inherent Spirits. The ſame thing is alſo affective by Medicines that are immoderately hot and diſcuſſive, yea, theſe are far more powerful to hurt, becauſ they more quickly and forcibly ſpoil the inherent Spirits, than the <hi>prementioned</hi> Nouriſhments.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Of Motion, Reſt, Exerciſes, and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</head>
               <p>Motion and Exerciſes, if they exceed a mean, they diſſolve the Body of a little Child into a profuſe Sweat, and withal they ſomwhat diſſipate the inherent Spirits of the Parts, and therfore for that reaſon they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire the introducing of this Diſeaſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> although we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it falleth out exceeding rarely, that Boys are infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with this Diſeaſ, wherof we diſcourſ. But a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Motion and want of Exerciſe doth moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, yea and moſt effectually concur to the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of this affect. For the Spinal Marrow, and the Nerves from thence ariſing, and the other firſt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted parts, ſerve chiefly for Motion and Exerciſes. A ſtupidity therfore and ſluggiſhneſs of thoſe parts, is a cauſ that neither their inherent heat is ſufficiently che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, nor that heat extenuated, nor the cold diſtemper ſtealing in baniſhed, nor the excrementitious, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous moiſtures expelled by a due tranſpiration, but it permitteth them to be affected with a certain ſoftneſs, looſneſs, and internal lubricity, wherupon the Arteries alſo deſtributed unto them are faintly irritated, yield a dull and ſlothful Pulſe, neither do they render the parts ſomwhat turgid or ſwelled, but leave them lank and ſubſiding. By which means the circulation of the Blood becomes ſlow and leſned, and more ſlippery than is meet, the production alſo of the vital heat muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon be neceſſarily be feeble and weak, all which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations do ſufficiently evince that this is an effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious cauſ of this Diſeaſ.</p>

               <p>We grant that Children ſhould ſleep oftner and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then Men; yet if it be exceſſive even in Child-hood the matter is the ſame as in defect of exerciſe and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For ſleep is a certain reſt and privation of watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or of the exerciſe of the ſenſes. But watchings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the very exerciſe of the ſenſes, according to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> in his Book <hi>de Som. &amp; Vigill.</hi> Wherefore the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils that we have deſcribed to ariſe from the defect of motion and exerciſes, the ſame alſo muſt needs happen from immoderate ſleep. On the contrary, in that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der age, inordinate watchings are no leſs noxious. For they do not only retard the concoction of the aliment, but they likewiſe taint the Blood with a kind of acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and conſequently diſſipate the Principals of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conſtitution of the firſt affected parts, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difficulty introduce a defect of inherent Spirits.</p>

                  <hi>Fiftly.</hi> Of things preternaturally caſt out and retained.</head>
               <p>All the internal cauſes of Diſeaſes might be perhaps not incommodiouſly reduced to this title. For any thing whatſoever contained in the Body, and preternaturally altered, as they are preternatural, they indicate their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and may ſo far forth be reputed among things to be caſt out, which are nevertheleſs preternaturally retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But we more rightly grant, that all internal cauſes may be diſtinguiſhed into two kinds: one wherof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth thoſe things which are preternaturally retained and caſt out: the other, ſuch things as are contained in the Body being preternaturally altered. For theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are not only taken away by caſting out, but alſo by
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:169706:94"/>
Alteration, they may be reduced to an agreeable propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature. However it be, there is a great affinity between the Humors vitiated by Alteration, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious Humors which are retained. For there are ſo many and ſuch various ways of caſting out in the Body, that ſcarce any humor can be imaginably produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Alteration, which doth not properly relate to the ſecretive and excretive faculty of ſome Bowel, or ſome other partt and is deſtinated to be ſevered and evacuated from it; and therefore though the errors of the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction are ſcarce corrected in the ſecond or third, by Alteration, yet they may be mended by local motion, or excretion, made from ſome part of the Body, the unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable parts being ſeparated and rejected. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the maſs of blood being any ways preternaturally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, or infected with ſome Humor, the peccant matter which cannot be otherwiſe ſubdued by Alteration, is quickly exterminated perhaps by excreſſion made from ſome part or Bowel (unleſs withal the ſecretive or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive faculty thereof be hindred) therefore it muſt needs be of great moment for a Phyſitian to know what Humors are particularly predominant in any Diſeaſ, and by what determinate ways they may be moſt properly ſpied out according to the intent and purpoſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>For there are as many ſubordinate ſpecies of things ſpied out, as there are diſtinct ſubſtances of the Bowels and other parts deſtinated to that office in the Body. For it is credible that the Liver doth caſt out one thing, the Kidnies another, the Sweet-Bread another, the Spleen another, the Stomach and Guts another, the Lungs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, the Brain another, the Stones, the Matrix, the Kidnies, the Kernel under the Canel Bone, the glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous parts of the <hi>Larynxes,</hi> the Throat and Jaws another,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:169706:95"/>
the ſcarf Skin and the Skin another. For it ſeemeth ſcarce admittable, that Nature ſhould build and prepare for her ſelf Organs of different kinds, and yet ſhould make uſe of divers of them for the performance of one and the ſame action. Therfore when the excretion of any of the ſaid parts hapneth to be reſtrained, a certain pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar filth will flow out from thence into the maſs of Blood, and ſo there wil be ſo many differences of things preternaturally retained, as there are kinds of parts inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to particular caſting out: and in like manner there wil be as many kinds of vitious excretion, either by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, defect or depravation, as there are divers wais tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row which the excretion may be made.</p>
               <p>If any man demand, Whether the ſeveral kinds of things excerned be ſufficiently diſcovered and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by us: We anſwer, that an exact knowledg is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired of that particular humor which is to be caſt out thorow the new Veſſel of the Sweet-Bread, then in the next place, what is caſt out by the Kidnies, the Kernel under the Canel Bone, and the glandulous parts of the <hi>Larynx:</hi> yea, perhaps it is yet ſcare ſufficiently known, what is rejected by the Spleen. For this cauſe therefore amongſt others, it ſeemed good unto us to ſuperſede in this place any high and accurate diſquiſition of things ſecerned and retained, either in relation to the parts and ways whereunto they belong, or in order to the preſent affect, and rather to inſiſt on that fourfold diviſion of Humors made by <hi>Galen;</hi> namely, into Choler, Phlegm, Blood, Melancholy, adding only undue tranſpiration and ſweating. For although we may doubt, whether this diviſion can deduce the humors to the ſubordinate Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, (as we have noted above) more then four parts diſtinct in the ſpecies are evidently dedicated to the caſting out of the humors; yet ſeing that this diviſion
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:169706:95"/>
of the Humors is not only approved by al Claſſical Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, but that it is likewiſe profitable in it ſelf, and at leaſt reduceth the Humors to certain Heads or Kinds, (however perhaps every kind may comprehend under it ſeveral ſpecies) we are reſolved for the preſent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon it, and ſo much the rather, becauſe under a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral notion it very fitly conjoyneth and containeth both things altered and preternaturally contained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and alſo things to be ſpied out which are not yet excerned, and in that reſpect it will eaſ our burden and contract our work. For whilſt we make our procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in this manner, it will be needleſs to inſtitute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other peculiar Chapter of the Cauſes of this Diſeaſ, namely of this altered which are preternaturally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, ſeing that they are comprehended, as we have ſaid, under this Title.</p>
               <p>We reduce therfore the internal Cauſes of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſ (whether they be excrementitious humors retained, or viciated by alteration) either to Choller, or to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly, or to Elegm and a Wateriſh humor, or an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due Tranſpiration and ſweating, for the Blood proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo called is in this affect ſcarce obſerved to be faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You may object, That Practical Phyſitians do in this Diſeaſ commonly preſcribe the opening of a Vein in the hollow of the Ear, obſerving that Evacuation to be very profitable, which Reaſon could hardly admit, unleſs the Blood were in ſome degree peccant?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We anſwer, That this Remedy is available, not in reſpect of the univerſal plenitude of the Blood, but by reaſon of a peculiar plenitude of the Head it ſelf. For we have already ſhewed how that the Blood is uneqally diſpenſed to the parts of the Body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and indeed illiberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the firſt affected parts, but to the Head ſuperabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:169706:96"/>
Therfore although there be not an univerſal redundancy of the Blood in this Diſeaſ, yet in reſpect of the particular Plenitude of the Head it ſelf, ſuch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular emptineſs, is perhaps profitably inſtituted thoſe outward and ſmal Veins of the Ears being cut. You may reply that we by this Anſwer do indeed decline the univerſal <hi>Plethora,</hi> but that we grant a particular one of the Head, which ought no leſs to be eſteemed a cauſ of ſickneſs, We anſwer, That we have at large explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this fault of the Blood, when we diſcourſed of the unequal diſtribution of it, unto which place it properly belongeth, ſeing that it is a cauſ of the Secondary, not of the Primary Eſſence of this Diſeaſ; and therfore a vain and ſuperfluous repetition therof ought not in this place to be expected, We will now therfore proceed to our purpoſed diſquiſition of the Humors, and likewiſe the Tranſpiration aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Firſt Choller (whether by this word you underſtand that excrementitious humor in the little Bladder, and the Chollerick pore, or a hot, dry, ſharp, and bitter part of the Maſs of Blood, or that unſavory humor that taſteth like ſtinking Oyl, begotten and flowing in the Stomach by ſome corrupt aliment, eſpecially, that which is fat, adduſt, or ſalt; or certain ſharp and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive Excreſcences produced in the Body by corrupt Blood) if it abound and luxuriate in the Body, very probably be a cauſ of this affect.</p>
               <p>For although it may rather ſeem to impugn that cold and moiſt diſtemper, which is a part of the firſt Eſſence of this Diſeaſ; yet in regard that it is apt in ſome ſort to hinder the nouriſhment of the Parts, either by a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement irritation of the expulſive faculty, or by attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the aliment, and to extenuate and waſt the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inherent conſtitution of the Parts, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:169706:96"/>
to conſume and diſſipate the Natural Spirits, it may not unjuſtly be numbred among the cauſes of this Diſeaſ. For every one knows that Perſons of a Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick Conſtitution are lean, and of an extenuated ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit becauſ of the Reaſons aforeſaid. Secondly, A Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly humor (whether you underſtand the Earthy Portion of the Blood, or that ſaltiſh or tartar like mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter excreted in and with the Urin, and when the Urin groweth cold, incorporating into little Sands; or that ſowr humor powred into the Ventricle perhaps by the Spleen (though not through that ſhort Veiny Veſſel, as the Ancients beleeved) or thoſe terrene Parts of the aſſumed Aliment, which are evacuated by ſiege with the other Excrements) underſtand either or any of them, if this humor aboundeth and be not purged out after a due manner, may be blamed as a cauſ of this Diſeaſ. For firſt, that humor which is the more Earthy part of the Blood, if it exceed a juſt proportion in the Maſs of Blood, it rendreth it unapt to nouriſh the Parts, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe that are firſt affected; for the firſt affected parts are of a more noble texture than the ſubſtances of the Bowels, or the bony parts; and therfore we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready noted how the <hi>Parenchymata</hi> of the Bowels and the Bones do eaſily admit nutrition, and by a way like unto digeſtion; but thoſe former parts do require a far more exquiſite ſecretion &amp; elaborated aſſimilation. And this is the Reaſon that the fleſhy parts of the Bowels are rightly imputed among the impure and groſſer aliments, namely, Becauſ they are nouriſhed with a courſ Blood, and not accurately elaborated before the Union. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Any great accumulation of Saltiſh, and Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar like matter is an Enemy to Nutrition, and is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſſipative and devouring than favoring augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Thirdly, The ſowr Humor of the Ventricle is
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:169706:97"/>
totally ravenous, and as it were hungerſtarved, and perhaps where it aboundeth it eaſily communicateth to the Blood ſuch another Depredatory quality; Fourthly and laſtly, The Terrene Dregs of the Belly may if they be inordinately retained, taint and infect the Chylus, and render it unapt for the nouriſhment of the part. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally we grant, that every propounded kind of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly ſuperfluouſly coagumented or preternaturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, doth not primarily, properly, and directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to the production of this evil; but nevertheleſs we are of opinion that indirectly, and after rhe manner propounded it may contribute ſomthing to the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Flegm (whether it be taken for the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and colder part of the Maſs of Blood, or for the wheyiſh part therof, or for the ſlow humor of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and Guts, or for the Spettle, or for the Snot of the Noſtrils or Jaws, or for that peculiar humor, which perhaps the new Veſſel of the Sweet-Bread doth uſe to evacuate) however you take it, if it be retained or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in the Body, it hath a direct reference to this Diſeaſ, and properly deſerveth to be called the cauſ ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For this humor is cold, moſt, ſlow, thick, benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, little ſpiritous, loſt, and affected with an internal ſlipperineſs; all which things do exactly comply with the primary and ſecondary Eſſence of this Diſeaſ as they have been propounded. Wherfore upon a ſuperfluous accumulation of this humor, ſeing that there ſucceedeth a conſpiracy to the production of this affect, it ought juſtly to be eſteemed a proper cauſ and a Primary Agent.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe humors undue Tranſpiration, as alſo immoderate or defective ſweating may be ſomtimes numbred among the cauſes of this affect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:169706:97"/>
For exceſſive Sweating, as alſo immoderate Tranſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, doth diſſipate the Spirits, and withal diſſolveth the parts, eſpecially the external which in this Diſeaſ are the firſt affected, and the inherent Spirits being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed it eaſily leaveth a cold diſtemper behind it. For to a juſt excitation and conſervation of the heat of the parts there is required a certain due and regular ſtrife of the exhalations between breathing, which if it prove deficient, the actual heat alſo (becauſ it partly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in this ſtrife) becomes very feeble and languid, and the parts are eaſily expoſed to a cold diſtemper. But we have already ſpoken of this matter at large. On the contrary, Sweat preternaturally reſtrained, as alſo a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmal or leſned Tranſpiration, doth eaſily kindle a Feaveriſh heat, and therfore it likewiſe injureth the Spirits and diſſolveth the parts, and rendreth them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards eaſily obnoxious to a cold diſtemper.</p>
               <p>Finally, That we may comprehend all in a word, Any humor excerned above Reaſon or Meaſure doth eaſily introduce a colliquation of the parts and a diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the inherent Spirits, and conſequently diſpoſeth the Body to this affect. And let this ſuffice to have been ſpoken of non-Natural things, and the cauſes of this Diſeaſ thence ariſing.</p>

Yet although many of them (as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the Parents and ſo imprint a Natural pollution in the Off-ſpring) are reherſed above, nevertheleſs, by right they here deſerve their conſideration, yet in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent reſpect and order. Theſe Diſeaſes we reduce to three Kinds or general Heads.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To Diſeaſes that have ſome affinity with this affect.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To Diſeaſes that extenuate the Body.</p>

               <head>Of the Firſt Kind.</head>
               <p>Diſeaſes having an Affinity or holding Congruity with this we call thoſe who at leaſt in part conſiſt in the ſame with the Eſſence of this Diſeaſ: of this kind are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cold diſtemper, or any moiſt diſtemper, alſo any cold and moiſt diſtemper. For a part of the firſt Eſſence of this Diſeaſ includeth a cold and moiſt diſtemper, and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:169706:98"/>
ſo thoſe diſtempers do partly agree with this Affect. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo belong a Phlegmatick <hi>Cachocymy,</hi> a Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and a mixt; an obſtruction proceeding from ſuch like humors, a <hi>Cachexia</hi> and a Dropſy. Yea, we may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe refer hither in regard of their affinity, thoſe Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes wherein the inherent Spirits are ſomwhat conſumed; for a part of the Eſſence of this Diſeaſ conſiſteth in a ſcarſity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of thoſe Spirits, but otherwiſe they are more aptly referred to the ſecond kind. In like manner the Diſeaſes wherin the firſt affected parts are benummed, &amp; ſtupified; may likewiſe in reſpect of their affinity, be hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto referred, although they belong more properly to the third kind of Diſeaſes. Moreover, thoſe Diſeaſes wherin the <hi>Tone</hi> of the parts is infeebled and looſned muſt here be liſted, for they include a part of this Diſeaſ; namely, that which conſiſteth in the looſneſſe, lither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, internal ſlipperineſs and ſoftneſs of the <hi>Tone,</hi> as they are above deſcribed. The Philoſophers ſay, that the Elements which agree in like qualities, are eaſily changed one into another; by the ſame reaſon that theſe Diſeaſes which partly agree in the ſame Eſſence do eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admit a reciprocal change from one to the other. So we ſee a quotidian Ague, which agreeth with a putrid Feaver in a preternatural heat, upon every ſlight Cauſe degenerate into it. Yet it muſt here be noted, That great Diſeaſes are not ſo eaſily changed into ſmal, as ſmal ones into great. Beſides, not all Diſeaſes which perhaps participate alike of the ſame Eſſence, are with an equal facility reciprocally changed. For ſome Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are more ſubject to change into others, with whom in part they have ſome agreement, than others: And that for other Reaſons beſide the ſaid agreement, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it be, if a cold and dry diſtemper ſhould happen to a Child, that would eaſily change into a cold and moiſt;
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:169706:99"/>
both in reſpect of the congruity of each Diſeaſ to cold, and alſo a peculiar inclination of that tender age to moiſture. For by reaſon of the coldneſs, the digeſtion becomes imperfect, and hereupon crudities or crude hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midities are engendred, which a cold diſtemper in ſo tender an age would eaſily and immediatly follow. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, a cold and moiſt diſtemper in regard of the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would make a ſlow Pulſe, and in regard of the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture would make it the more ſlippery, and the leſs viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous, wherupon the Vital heat being diminiſhed, a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummedneſs and dulneſs by little and little would ſteal upon the Vital Spirits. Finally, in reſpect of that ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periſh retention ariſing from the internal ſlipperineſs of the parts, and by reaſon of the weak concoction, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Spirits of the firſt affected parts, would alſo by degrees be diminiſhed, and ſo by little and little after this manner the perfect Eſſence of this Diſeaſ wil be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced.</p>

            <div n="2" type="part">
               <head>Of the ſecond kind.</head>
               <p>Moſt Diſeaſes making lean, or any ways extenuating the Body, although perhaps they no way participate of of the Eſſence of this Diſeaſ (like the Diſeaſes of the firſt kind) yet they do diſpoſe the Body to the invaſion of this affect, and may alſo leave it after them. For all great quotidian Diſeaſes, in proceſs of time do extenuate the Body, waſt the inherent Spirits, and diſſolve the <hi>Tone</hi> of the parts; and this attrition and attenuation of the parts doth chiefly refer to the firſt affected parts in this Diſeaſ. For as we have already aſſerted, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Bowels are not ſo eaſily ſubjected to diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution or diſſipation. But in the diſſected Carcaſſes of thoſe who have dyed of Chronical Affects, the Bowels
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:169706:99"/>
are obſerved to be no leſs; yea, many times much bigger when the external parts (which in this Diſeaſ are firſt affected) are for the moſt part made lean with the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of the affect. And therefore ſeing that extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Diſeaſes, do chiefly communicate their force into the firſt affected parts, it eaſily falleth out that in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren they help to introduce this Diſeaſ. For the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Spirits of the firſt affected parts being very much waſted, a cold diſtemper muſt needs follow, which by reaſon of the crudity is (as we have ſaid above) received by a moiſt one and a benummedneſs; becauſe the heat, activity, and vigor of the parts do chiefly depend upon the plenty of Spirits. And thus we have exhibited the manner wherby this Diſeaſ doth follow and as it were tread in the footſteps of other foregoing affects of this kind, which we now further ſubdiſtinguiſh into three Claſſes.</p>
               <p>The firſt comprehendeth Diſeaſes extenuating and conſuming the habit of the body, by ways inſenſible; hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are referred almoſt al Feavers, eſpecially the <hi>Hectick</hi> and Conſuming, an Ulcer of Lungs with a putrid Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Alſo any continual Feaver that is violent, as a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, malignant, peſtilential Feaver, a Pleuriſie, and an inflamation of the Lungs, alſo the ſmal Pox, and the Meazels when they grievouſly afflict the Patient. In like manner intermitting Chronical Feavers. Laſtly, al Chronical Feavers that torment with vehemence do the ſame. The ſecond Claſſis containeth Diſeaſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming by manifeſt paſſages, and evacuating the ſolid ſubſtance of the parts. Hither you may refer immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate vomiting, a <hi>Lyentery, Dyſentery, Lask,</hi> the Hepatical Flux, the <hi>Diabetes,</hi> any profuſe <hi>Hemorrhage</hi> or Bloody Iſſue, any exceſſive ſweating, any great Ulcer in any part, eating deep, and dayly caſting out much matter.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:169706:100"/>
For al theſe Affects do evidently extenuate the habit of the body, and cauſe the introduction of this affect.</p>
               <p>The third containeth the Diſeaſes which are ſaid to extenuate the ſubſtance of the parts not directly, but by conſequence: as al Diſeaſes interrupitng concoction or the diſtribution of the Blood. For theſe prohibit the reparation of the parts continually fed upon by the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal heat. Hereupon ſeveral Diſeaſes of the Ventricle, Guts, <hi>Meſentery,</hi> Sweet-Bread, Spleen, Liver; Yea, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes in the Mouth, Jaws or Throat, which hinder on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the aſſumption or ſwallowing of the Meat, may in this reſpect be numbred among the cauſes of this Diſeaſ. As a diſtemper, a tumor, a nauſeating, a feeble appetite of the ventricle, a diſtemper, a tumor an obſtruction &amp; <hi>Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi> of the <hi>Meſentery,</hi> &amp; Sweet-bread, or the Liver, Spleen, and the like effects of any of the ſaid parts, which by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny means fruſtrate the due concoction and diſtribution of the nouriſhment, and thereupon extenuate the parts by defect of nutrition.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="part">
               <head>Of the third kind.</head>
               <p>Diſeaſes that induce an aſtoniſhment to the firſt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted parts, do alſo by a peculiar propriety conſpire the production of this Affect. For the Natural heat of thoſe parts is ſomwhat dulled by them, and is rendred leſs effectual: whereupon a cold diſtemper ſtealeth in by degrees, which is alſo (as hath been ſaid) eaſily waited on with a moiſt diſtemper, a ſoftneſs, and internal ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perineſs. Moreover, the Pulſ of the Arteries reaching to thoſe parts is ſecretly, and by little and little weakned, the diſtribution of the Blood, and the Vital Heat is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed, the parts themſelvs are ſparingly nouriſhed, and at length there comes a defect of Natural Spirits. So that from this Root alſo, for ſome time perſevering
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:169706:100"/>
the Eſſence of this Diſeaſ may at laſt bud forth. The <hi>Apoplexy, Palſy, Lethargy,</hi> and the like effects do chiefly belong hither. Yet Children do exceeding rarely fall into this affect from theſe ſleepy Cauſes, and ſo rarely, that we have not yet obſerved this Diſeaſ to own its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to ſuch affects. If any demand a Reaſon of this rarity; we ſay, that the Bodies of Children by reaſon of their permeability and thinneſs, are ſeldom ſubjected to thoſe affects; but if at any time they are invaded by them the Diſeaſ doth not firſt aſſault the Natural or Vital, but the Animal Conſtitution, and conſequently procureth for the moſt part a deprivation of the Animal Faculty, before it interrupteth either the Natural or the Vital. But the benummedneſs wherof we now ſpeak, belongeth to the Natural Conſtitution, into which it cannot be preſently transferred. Moreover, they are eaſily and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily driven out, by reaſon of the facility of tranſpiration in the Bodies of Children, if peradventure thoſe affects do gently invade them: but if they rage and tyrrannize, they eaſily and ſpeedily diſpatch and kil, as being in their own Nature moſt terrible and grievous Diſeaſes; and the ſooner, becauſe of the weakneſs of their Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons over whom they prevail. But which way ſoever they happen, they ſcarce continue ſo long, as with ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient efficacy to imprint this benummedneſs in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conſtitution of the parts. Yet we grant that theſe affects may, if perhaps, they perſiſt longer with life, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Natural Conſtitution with that benummedneſs ſo that this Diſeaſ may follow thereupon, although we can neither juſtify, nor aſſert it upon the credit of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle obſervation.</p>
               <p>But the Diſeaſes which do moſt frequently introduce an aſtoniſhment in the Natural Conſtitution of the firſt affected parts, are thoſe very ſame, which hinder
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:169706:101"/>
Children any way from ordinary actions and due exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, eſpecially from the uſe of their feet, as the luxation fracture, or ſom wound of a foot, or thigh, or the leg, or the Back-bone: alſo tumors and pains, or the like af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, whether they afflict the parts aforeſaid or others, provided that they hinder the Children, ſo that they cannot walk, or play ſtanding upon their legs, or uſe any Maſculine Exerciſes. For hereupon by degrees the rigor and heat of the external parts waxeth dul, which in this evil are the parts firſt affected, and from thence the other parts of the Eſſence of this affect, follow by an uninterrupted and linked ſucceſſion, as whoſoever wil may ſee above.</p>
               <p>We have now run over the Cauſes of this Affect, and ſhould in the next place proceed to the differences ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but that two difficulties do here interpoſe themſelvs, which properly reſult from a higher conſideration of the Cauſes propounded. For al thoſe Cauſes now allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſeem as wel common to Boys of big growth, as to Children, whereupon it may very pertinently be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>How it comes to paſs, that they which are grown to mans Eſtate are not infeſted with this evil, as wel as Children?</hi> Then again, Seing that the Cauſes propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded are al of them almoſt common, both to <hi>England</hi> and many other Countreys, &amp; ſom of them to al Climats of the Earth, It may be demanded in the ſecond place, <hi>Why this diſeaſ is more frequent and rife in</hi> England, <hi>than in other Countreys?</hi> Theſe Queſtions we ſhal examine in order, and ſhal freely deliver our judgment concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</p>

But we reſerve the ſolution of this doubt til the cloſe of the preſent determination. Therfore in the mean time the Conſtitutions or diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions both of Children that are chiefly obnoxious to this Diſeaſ, and alſo of bigger Boyes which are rarely ſubject unto it, muſt be oppoſed and every way conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and thought on: alſo of Youths, Men, and Old Men, and that in order and relation to this Affect.

            <p>Firſt, The yonger Children are of a colder tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament than the Elder. For the heat of the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is augmented from the time of the birth to mans eſtate, at which time it ſtandeth at a ſtay being far more intenſive than that of Children, but afterwards it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth by degrees unto extream old age, and a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that extream age, it falleth into the ſame degree as it held in the time of Child-hood; but before the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of this term of extream old age the temperament of aged men is more hot than that of Children, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though yong Children may enjoy a greater plenty of Natural heat, and abound with Natural Spirits, yet there is no neceſſity that they therfore muſt be of a hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter temperament, for there is required a concurrence of many things to conſtitute a hot temperament, beſide the inherent Spirits, and the inherent heat; as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a large portion of Chollerick humors, and withal or chiefly a ſtrong endeavor of the Vital faculty, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the pulſes, and the Vital Spirits in their circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Seing therfore that the yonger Children are more cold, it is no wonder, if they be more ſubject to cold Diſeaſes than others, ſuch as this is. As for old men, eſpecially ſuch as are inclining to extream old age, we grant that they alſo are more cold, and upon every light occaſion obnoxious to cold Diſeaſes. Wherfore from hence, namely, from the coldneſs of the temperament, we infer no difference between yonger Children &amp; theſe
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:169706:102"/>
old men, in reſpect of an aptitude to fall into this affect.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The yonger Children are more moiſt than the elder; for to wax old, if it be taken in a ſound ſence, is to wax dry. For although old men after their manner may be likewiſe obnoxious to moiſt affects, as Cathars, Obſtructions, a <hi>Cachexy,</hi> a Dropſie, a Palſie, a Lethargy, a looſneſs and trembling of the Nervs, and the like evils, yet really there is ſome difference between a moiſt diſtemper which happeneth to Boys, and that which befalleth aged Perſons. For in Children an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious humidity conſtituting the diſtemper doth not only penetrate the moſt retired ſubſtance of the ſolid parts, but they are totally incorporated with the ſame: But in old Men the ſolid parts, even then when it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with a moiſt diſtemper, doth not ſeem to part with its earthineſs, but to be in ſome ſort compounded of that Earthy Nature, and a certain adventitious crude and moiſt Juice, or elſe an excrementitious drunk into the pores, or into the ſubſtance of the parts, yet it is not ſufficiently incorporated or united. For as ſand, being drenched in much water, retaineth al its Earthy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, however it be ſomwhat moiſt; So alſo the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of old Men, however they may be moyſtened with crude and excrementitious humors, yet do they not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite that terrene ſubſtance, or that part which by the <hi>Chymicks</hi> is deſigned by the name of a dead Head, which they dayly accumilate unto themſelves from their firſt beginning. This diſtemper therfore of old Perſons is ſpurious not genuine, crude and not perfectly digeſted into the ſubſtance of the parts. And therefore although we grant that old men may in their way, labor with a moiſt diſtemper, yet it is manifeſt withal by what hath been ſaid, how great a difference there is between this of aged perſons, &amp; that of Yong children. Morover, that
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:169706:103"/>
this moiſt diſtemper of old men, is leſs Homogeneal to the preſent affect, then that of children, appears plainly from hence, becauſe it produceth not that ſoftneſs and tenderneſs of parts in old men, as we ſee it doth in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, neither doth it equally diſpoſe them to a diſſipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or colliquation of the inherent Spirits, or any ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery paſſage either of the Blood or Exhalations, which are ſuppoſed in this Affect: But on the other ſide, it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rendreth them obnoxious to obſtructions, and the other evils recited before a compariſon, therefore being made between the cold and moiſt diſtemper incident to Younger Children, and that which is wont to affect old men, there reſulteth a pregnant reaſon, why aged people are not ſo ſubject to this Diſeaſ as Children.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Yong Children, although they Naturally abound with inherent Spirits, yet by reaſon of the eaſie tranſpiration of their Bodies, &amp; becauſ of the laxity, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and incoherence of the parts, they are much more prone then Elder perſons to diſſipation and colliquation of the Inherent Spirits, and by conſequence upon leſs and ſlighter cauſes they fal into a want of them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Younger Children by reaſon of that very ſame weak conſiſtance of the parts, are alſo rendred more obnoxious to an aſtoniſhment than the Elder. For to the vigor and activity of the parts, there is required be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a juſt plenty of Spirits, a ſtrength of their coherence and conſiſtence.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, it is not needful for us to ad any thing concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Tone</hi> of the parts, ſeing we have ſo often inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated the weakneſs of it in Younger Children in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Elder, and any man may obſerve that upon the increaſe of years the <hi>Tone</hi> is more and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, As for the diminute diſtribution of the blood
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:169706:103"/>
to the firſt affected parts, (which we have already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be a conſiderable part of the ſecondary Eſſence of this Diſeaſ) We ſay, that the Elder Children do uſe more ſtrong and frequent exerciſes then the Younger, and therefore that the pulſes of the outward parts are more ſtrongly ſtirred up in them, and that a greater heat is raiſed and cheriſhed in them, and by conſequence a cold diſtemper is more potentially driven out of them.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, as for the Organical faults, namely, the augmented magnitude of the Liver Head, and their Veſſels, it is a known thing that the proportion of the parts is more ſtable and confirmed in the bigger Children, and on the contrary that in the Younger they are eaſily moved and altered, but the augmentation cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing they are not any more afterwards altered, without ſome unuſual and weighty cauſes. So that even in this reſpect the Younger Children are moſt ſubject to this Diſeaſ.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore conclude the parts of the Queſtion, That Young Children, in reſpect of their Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions and diſpoſitions are more obnoxious to this evil then thoſe that are Elder, and ſo much the more, the Younger they are.</p>
            <p>But we muſt not wave an Objection, that here we meet with, which alſo doth very fitly conveigh an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of paſſing to the other compariſon; namly, of Young Children amongſt themſelves. <hi>For if Young Children</hi> (as is manifeſt by what hath been ſaid) <hi>are more prone to this Diſeaſ by their Natural Conſtitution and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and the Younger they are, the more ſubject they are: How comes it to paſs, that Children rarely fal into this affect, before they are ſix months old and ſomwhat more?</hi> For according to the Opinion delivered, Children
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:169706:104"/>
ſhould ſeem to be principally ſubject to this Diſeaſ im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after their birth, which yet experience diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth; yea, rather indeed it witneſſeth the contrary; namely, that Children before they are nine months old are ſeldom or ſcarce ever afflicted with this Diſeaſ. Here therefore it wil be needful for us to declare that other compariſon of Young Children among themſelvs. For it cannot be, that this Affect ſhould ſo conſtantly ſpare Children, chiefly diſpoſed unto it, and frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade thoſe that are leſs diſpoſed, unleſs ſome difference did intervene, which did in a diverſe manner relate to thoſe ages, and which notwithſtanding the propenſity of Nature doth retard the invaſion of the Diſeaſ, before the firſt twelve months were compleatly expired, and yet afterwards, either doth not at all or not ſo potently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend Children from this Diſeaſ. Here therefore we muſt find the very reaſon of the difference between theſe ages: which that we may the ſooner do, it wil not perhaps be impertinent to take ſpecial notice by the way of thoſe ages, which upon the authority of experience are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be more frequently affected with this Diſeaſ, and likewiſe thoſe ages which are leaſt afflicted with it.</p>
            <p>We affirm therefore, that this Diſeaſ doth very rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invade Children preſently after their birth, or before they are ſix months old; (yea, perhaps before the ninth month) but after that time it beginneth by little and little daily to rage more and more to the period of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen months, then it attaineth its pitch and exaltation, and as it were reſteth in it, till the Child be two years and ſix months old: So that the time of the thickeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion is that whol year, which bears date from the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth month, two years and a half being expired the Diſeaſ falleth into its declination, and ſeldom invadeth the Child, for the reaſons already alleadged. But the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:169706:104"/>
reaſons <hi>Why Infants newly born are rarely affected, and why from the ninth to the eighteenth month they are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently affected, and why after the firſt eighteen months they are moſt frequently affected</hi> ſhall now all of them in their order be produced.</p>
            <p>The Firſt Reaſons why Children newly born are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeldom invaded with this affect may be theſe.</p>
            <p>The Firſt is, Becauſ the <hi>Embryon</hi> in the Womb is by the equal heat and embracement of the Matrix ſtrongly fortified againſt this Diſeaſ, as we have declared above, and by conſequence the ſame being brought to light doth for a time retain ſom of that, muniment &amp; defence which it contracted from that equal warmth of the Womb, and therfore preſently after the Birth it doth not ſo eaſily fall into it.</p>
            <p>The Second is, Becauſ the Midwives and Nurſes do handle them ſo artificially when they are new born, that their condition is not conſiderably different from that which they poſſeſſed in the Womb. For they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrap the whol Body, excepting the Head, in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Covering; wherupon the exterior and firſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected parts of the Body in this Diſeaſ are fortified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the injuries of the outward cold, and the hot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations breaking out from any part of the Body are duly and equally retained by reaſon of that Covering which is two or three times double, and bound about with ſwathing Bands, and equally communicated to all the parts of the Body, ſo that they are cheriſhed with an even heat as it were in a common Hypocauſt or hot Houſ. Seing therfore that the firſt part of the Eſſence of this Diſeaſ conſiſteth in an unequal cold diſtemper, it is no wonder if theſe Defences and Fortifications of the Body do avert it at leaſt for ſome ſhort time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:169706:105"/>
The Third Reaſon may perhaps be the wholſomneſs of the Diet, for Breaſt-Milk is the moſt ſolubrious and agreeable nouriſhment that tender age, eſpecially when it is ſucked from the Breaſts: for it is a ſimple and uniform Meat, full of nouriſhment, eaſie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct, and friendly and farmiliar to the conſtitution of Infants. Therfore ſo long as they are conveniently nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with it, they incur the fewer errors of diet, and are rendred the leſs obnoxious to this Diſeaſ. Yet it muſt be noted, that if the Nurſes milk be not laudable and good in it ſelf, or otherwiſe diſagreable to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Infant, then this reaſon is of no force. Therefore if the Nurſe be big with Child, or immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly addicted to Venery, or any ways ſickly, or given to drunkenneſs and inordinate feeding, it is ſafer to haſten the weaning of the Infant, unleſs you are provided of a better Nurſe.</p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt reaſon is the ſlowneſs of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Diſeaſ in his firſt invaſions. For it ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on ſo ſlowly, that it ſcarce bewrayeth any preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to an aſſault til ſome months are expired, unleſs the progreſs of it be advanced by ſome extraordinary and moſt vehement Cauſes, as by ſome more violent Affect preceding or coming upon it. Seing therefore that this Diſeaſ doth ſo ſlowly take Root, and ſeing that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as we have formerly ſhewed, are commonly born free from it, it ſeldom hapneth to break out evidently into act til the ſixth, yea, indeed til the ninth month. And thus we have given the reaſons, why Infants newly born, notwithſtanding the weakneſs of their Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are for many months priviledged from this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſ.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The cauſes why Children from the ninth to the eighteenth Month are every day more frequently infeſted with this affect, are theſe,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:169706:105"/>
Firſt, Becauſ the firſt Cauſ even now propounded, driving away this Diſeaſ in thoſe that are new born, doth daily remit, and before the ninth Month doth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally vaniſh. Secondly, In like manner the ſecond pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive Cauſ before alledged till that age doth every day grow more effectual. For the hands of Infants, after ſome Months, if not before, are uſually ſet at liberty from the priſon of their Blankets, and perhaps their Feet alſo before they are ſix months old, although at night they are ſwadled up again. In the day time ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the leaſt theſe outward Members are deſtitute of that common and comfortable warmth. The Nurſes likewiſe do many times er, when they cloath the weak and feeble Infants too ſoon. For they idly define the time of cloathing them by the number of the Months, ſeing that they ſhould rather give an eſtimation of it by the ſtrength and activity of the motion of their Hands and Feet. For when the motion and exerciſe of thoſe parts doth avail more to excite and cheriſh their heat, and to irritate their Pulſes, than the warmth of their ſwadling cloaths, without all controverſie that is the time to deveſt Infants from their ſwadling cloaths. Moreover thirdly, After the ninth Month Children u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually are fed with other aliment beſides Breaſt-Milk or other Milk, and from that variety in feeding there eaſily reſulteth ſome errors in point of Diet. Fourthly, The ſlowneſs of the Motion of this Diſeaſ doth not hinder, but that it may break forth into act after the ninth Month. For the motion, by reaſon of the unperceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſlowneſs of it, at the end of certain months, doth exhibit ſome effects and impreſſions. Laſtly the evils of breeding teeth do likewiſe contribute very much to the ſame purpoſe. For the Teeth begin to breed common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about the ſeventh Month, and come accompanied
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:169706:106"/>
with divers Symptoms, which eaſily diſpoſe tender Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to this affect.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Cauſes why this Diſeaſ moſt frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rageth when the Child is eighteen Months old, are;</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſ the Cauſes before cited haſtning this Diſeaſ in the yonger Children, are upon the approach of this age taken away, or at leaſt they operate with weak and ineffectual powers.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The evils of breeding Teeth, although in reſpect of the immediate Symptoms which they produce perhaps before this time, they nouriſh; yet for the moſt part they leave behind them in the firſt affected parts a certain diſpoſition, which privily hiding it ſelf within them, after the term of ſome months produceth this Diſeaſ. But the breaking out of the Dog-teeth chiefly hath reference to this place; ſeing that theſe break out a little before the Child is a year and an half old, and their coming forth likewiſe is of al other the moſt pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Hitherto belong alſo thoſe accidents which happen by reaſon of ablactation or weaning of the Child, and at that time a great alteration befalleth Children in matter of Diet, which they endure not without palpable moleſtation. For herupon they are angry, they cry, the commotions of their minds makes them forſake the nouriſhment of their Bodies, they are hard to be pleaſed, neither do they ſleep quietly. All which things do eaſily imprint in the parts firſt affected at leaſt a foregoing diſpoſition (although perhaps not till a long time after) to this affect.</p>
            <p>And ſo at length we have alſo run through this ſecond Compariſon, namely of yong Children among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and we have briefly explained the Cauſes why
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:169706:106"/>
thoſe Children at one age are more, and at another age are leſs expoſed to this evil.</p>
            <p>The Third part of the Queſtion ſtill remaineth, which as we ſaid we would reſerve to be examined at the cloſe of this Diſputation; namely, Whether thoſe that are of a greater age do ſomtimes fall (though ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding rarely into this Diſeaſ.)</p>
            <p>We ſay firſt, For ſo much as concerneth that part of the Eſſence of this Diſeaſ, which conſiſteth in a moiſt diſtemper, that ſome difference muſt be expected to be between that diſtemper in yonger Children, and thoſe that are bigger, in yong Men, Men, and eſpecially in old Men, for the ſame difference which we put before between the moiſt diſtemper of yong Children and old Men, may according to quantity as more or leſs, be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved between the middle Ages, and therfore the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity of the yonger Children will be better concocted and more genuine than that of the elder, as it is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to collect, <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> from the ſame reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As for the organical faults, we affirm that neceſſarily there concurreth a vaſt difference between Diſeaſes of this kind incident to Children, and perhaps to thoſe of greater age, for the tumors of the Bones in the Wreſts and Ankles, as alſo that narrowneſs of the Breaſt, likewiſe that diſproportionatly augmented bigneſs of the Head and Liver, are either leſs conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or altogether undeſcernable, eſpecially in thoſe that are grown to full age. For as the years encreaſ the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure and proportion of the Parts becomes more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, firm, and ſtable; neither doth it eaſily come to paſs that one part doth much grow out more than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by true augmentation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We ſay that excepting the two premiſed
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:169706:107"/>
conditions, and that in that manner as they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, this affect according to the other parts of the Eſſence thereof (although indeed very rarely and upon the higheſt cauſes only) may happen to Boys, Young Men, Men, and old Men. For firſt a cold diſtemper without al controverſie may befal them, though not ſo eaſily as Children. Secondly, A moiſt diſtemper may alſo invade them, but yet only by the limitation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. Thirdly, A want of inherent Spirits, may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo befal them, but then it muſt proceed from the moſt potent cauſes. For Chronical Diſeaſes and ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the habit of the parts, or diſſipate it into ayr, or waſt it by long faſting and an <hi>Atrophy,</hi> do neceſſarily leave behind them a paucity of Natural Spirits. We ſee the outward parts even in thoſe that are grown to ful age, when they are extenuated and conſumed by ſuch like cauſes, to wax feeble, to languiſh, wither, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come deſtitute of al ſufficient Spirituoſity. Yet we grant that in thoſe that are grown to full age, the evil which cauſeth leanneſs being overcome, the waſted Spirits may ſoon be repaired by the vigor of the Pulſes, and that the rudiments and impreſſions of this Diſeaſ may be rooted out within one or two weeks, and by conſequence, that they are ſeldom affected with it. In the interim, if it ſhould ſo fal out, that upon that conſuming of the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Spirits ſome impediment ſhould intervene that might retard their reparation, it is poſſible that this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſ may grow from thence in that manner as hath been ſaid. But a numbneſs of the Inherent Spirits muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily follow upon a fewneſs of them. Fourthly, The parts of the Secondary Eſſence, ſeing that they have a ſtrong dependance upon the Primary faults, where theſe perſevere long (the Organical faults being excepted) they may ſupervene in their order. So that we do not
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:169706:107"/>
doubt but this Diſeaſ may happen to any age after child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; the reſtrictions which we have now propounded being granted, and upon the urgency and perſeverance of great and weighty cauſes.</p>
            <p>One amongſt us affirmeth, that he had a Gentleman in cure about thirty yeers of age, who by dayly immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare uſe of Wine and Tobacco, continued for ſome whole years, having neglected the due receiving of his meat, fel into ſuch a weakneſs of Stomach, that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally every morning he vomited, and loathed al kind of Meat, and if at any time he ſwallowed any with unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs, he preſently vomited it up again: to appeaſe this quezineſs of Stomach, he was at laſt compelled to a continual uſe of ordinary <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> but afterwards his cuſtome was to mingle it with ſtale Beer, and a quantity of Sugar; and with this drink alone he preſerved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alive for many months. In the mean time all thoſe parts which in this Diſeaſ we cal the firſt affected, were extreamly lean, and became ſoft, looſe, languid and withered, ſo that he could neither turn himſelf in his bed, nor riſe, nor walk, nor ſtand upright, yet he felt no pain, neither was there any privation of ſenſ and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no cough, no uneaſy reſpiration, his face was well colored, and al the parts about his Head were in a good condition, and wel habited, ſo that had you judged of him by his countenance only, you could ſcarce have ſuſpected that he was ſick. As he lay in his bed he would chat with his Companions, take Tobacco by turns, and drink that mixture of Beer and <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> aforeſaid. The event of the Diſeaſ doth not indeed belong to this place, yet we ſhal ſet it down to gratify them who are deſirous to know it. The Phyſitian being ſent for, he ſtrictly forbad al intemperance, and amongſt other remedies having given him one grain &amp; a half of <hi>Laudanum Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinenſis,</hi>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:169706:108"/>
he appeaſed the nauſeous infirmity, and tumult of his Stomach, which part he likewiſe ſtrengthned with internal and external applications, and preſcribed him ſuch a diet as was moſt eaſy of concoction. Inſtead of exerciſe he ſolicited the heat unto the outward parts with rubbing them every morning: having firſt given a ſmal quantity of ſtrengthning and opening Electuary, made up with a little portion of Steel, which he drank in two ounces of Wine, compoſed of Wormwood and Mint, a little Saffron being hung in it, to give it a tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture; three ounces of ſmal Beer, being tempered with it, and a quantity of Sugar to make the taſte of it more pleaſant. Moreover, he purged him by fits with gentle Medicines, and in the evening comforted him with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials. Within twenty days he grew to ſuch a degree of amendment, that he could walk abroad, for the ſpace of an hour, and could without any ſtriving or much weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs climb ladders without any help. But afterwards by a relaps into the like intemperance, he died in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Phyſitian. But let us return from this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion into the way, &amp; direct our ſpeech to our inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſcope. The Affect being now confirmed, as it was upon the firſt coming of the Doctor; Beſides the faults of the Stomach, it ſeemed to include a great part of the Eſſence of this Diſeaſ, we now treat of. For in the parts ſubſervient to motion; namely, thoſe that are firſt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in this Diſeaſ, there was a cold diſtemper, either through defect of motion, or by reaſon of the immunite afflux and diſpenſation of the Vital Blood. Again, the ſoftneſs, ſlipperineſs, laxity, and litherneſs of thoſe parts ſhewed that there was a moiſt diſtemper in them. Alſo the extream leanneſs of thoſe parts did ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate a fewneſs of inherent Spirits, and the unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to motion, and affectation of reſt and eaſ did ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:169706:108"/>
witneſs a numbneſs in thoſe parts. The ful and flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing habit of the parts about the Head, when the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts were extenuated, was a forcible reaſon to prove the unequal diſtribution of the Blood. But the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar cauſe of this inequality in this ſick man, might be his frequent vomiting, whereby a more plentiful af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of the Blood was driven to the parts about the Head the other being almoſt deſtitute of it.</p>
            <p>Any man may perceive by what hath been ſaid, that at leaſt the greateſt part of the Eſſence of this Diſeaſ was comprehended in this mentioned Affect. From whence at length we may<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> probably infer, that it is poſſible for this Diſeaſ to happen to thoſe of ful growth, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered according to the propounded limitations; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it very ſeldom coms to paſs, becauſe great cauſes and length of time are required to the production of it. And thus at laſt we have put an end to the ſearch upon the former Queſtion.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XIX. The latter Queſtion. Why this Diſeaſ happeneth more frequently in <hi>England,</hi> then in other Countreys? And whether it be Natural to <hi>Engliſhmen?</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is acknowledged by the common conſent of Phyſitians that there are certain <hi>Country Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes;</hi> namely, which more frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the Inhabitants of ſome one Region, than of another, by reaſon of ſom Common Cauſ. But ſeing the relation of the Country to the Diſeaſes uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raging in it, may be obſerved to be of a diverſ kind; and ſeing wiſe men have improperly denominated ſome Diſeaſes from certain Countreys: Finally, ſeing that they who have hitherto written of Countrey Diſeaſes have without difference, called all Diſeaſes which are moſt rife in any Region by the name of <hi>National</hi> or <hi>Countrey Diſeaſes</hi> as if they did equally participate of the Nature of a Countrey Diſeaſ; we have judged it to be a profitable enterprize to premiſe ſome things in this preſent diſquiſition, concerning the differences of theſe Diſeaſes among themſelves.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Therefore thoſe affects which have the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Country Diſeaſes, from the Region, are <hi>properly,</hi> or <hi>leſs properly, and abuſively ſo called.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:169706:109"/>
There are four conditions required to denominate a Country Diſeaſ properly ſo called.</p>
            <p>The firſt condition is, <hi>That the Diſeaſ be more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in that Region, unto which it is attributed, as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and common, then in any other Region, unto which it is not attributed as ſuch.</hi> For a common or Country Diſeaſ, is always ſuppoſed to have an unequal reference to divers Regions, and to infeſt one more (namly, that unto which it is aſcribed) and another leſs.</p>
            <p>The Second Condition is, <hi>That the Diſeaſ depends upon ſome kind of inclemency of the place.</hi> For a Diſeaſ properly common imputeth a certain crime or faultineſs to the very place; therfore when a place is not guilty of ſom peculiar fault, ſuch an imputation is improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, falſly and unjuſtly aſcribed unto it.</p>
            <p>The Third Condition is, <hi>That the inclemency and ſharpneſs of the Region be ſo great, as to affect the more wary, and ſuch as obſerve a du Regiment of health, and ſuch an one as is apropriated to the place.</hi> For in the Regiment of health ſome peculiar Caution is due to certain Countries. Therfore when a People neglecting ſuch a peculiar Obſervation of the place, ſhal fall into ſome Epidemical Diſeaſ by an erroneous uſe of the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural things, that it is not to be reputed a common diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſ, but to be imputed to the error, want of wit, incogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy and negligence of the Inhabitants. For this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſ, which we ſuppoſe might have been prevented, had the Regiment of health apropriated to the place been rightly obſerved.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Condition is, <hi>That that vicious conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Country do either continue long, or return of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</hi> For the fault of a place that is fugitive, not perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent nor often returning, muſt be accompted as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what forregn and meerly accidental in reſpect of the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:169706:110"/>
Region, and cannot properly denominate a common Diſeaſe. As for example, If a pernicious and unuſual Air ſhould chance to be blown hither from other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and ſhould produce a common diſeaſ, which ſhould not prevail beyond ſome months; that diſeaſ ought not properly to be called common, but rather caſual and chanceable. Wherfore the Feaver of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and the Sweating-ſickneſs of <hi>England,</hi> although they obtained their Names chiefly from thoſe Regions, yet are they abuſively termed common, becauſe they want a durable fomentation from thoſe places, and becauſ they either ceaſ altogether, or at leaſt are not for the preſent more predominent in this or that place than in another.</p>
            <p>Diſeaſes improperly comon do indeed include the firſt propounded condition of ſuch as are properly ſo called, namely, becauſe they more frequently occur in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion whereunto they are attributed, then in another, (for otherwiſe they would not deſerve the apellation of Diſeaſes improperly common) yet they want the ſecond third, and fourth. For they either lack that fomentation that is rooted in the Region, or that fomentation which they have is very weak and in conſiderable, which alſo may be overcom by a Regiment of diet appropriated to the place; or finally the fomentation is not perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent nor durable, nor frequently returning. Now by fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation we underſtand ſomwhat that is faulty in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of health, founded likewiſe in the condition of the Country. Therefore when ſom common and frequent Diſeaſ ariſeth from the abuſe of ſome commodity of the Region, as if ſom Nation by reaſon of the great plenty of fruit, and the like fruitfulneſs of the place, or by reaſon of a long and ſecure peace ſhould abuſe themſelves to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, ſloath or the like vices and thereby incur ſom common Diſeaſ, that Diſeaſ is not properly to be
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:169706:110"/>
called common. For the occaſion of that Diſeaſ, which the Country did ſupply with, was laudable in it ſelf, and therfore what event ſoever ſucceeded, the abuſe therof ought to be imputed to the error of the inhabitants, not to any unkindneſs or diſcourteſie of the Region. In like manner if the fomention of a Diſeaſ be culpable, yet ſhall not that be founded in the very conſtitution of the Country, but in ſome action of men, as when after the deſolations of War the unburied Carkaſſes pollute the Air with their putrifaction, and therupon introduce an Epidemical Diſeaſ, this ought not to be called a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or Country Diſeaſ, becauſ it dependeth upon the liberty of mans will, and was not procured by any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per fault of the place.</p>
            <p>Somtimes alſo a Diſeaſ is aſcribed to a Nation or Place by calumny, and abuſively through the malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and corrupt intentions of ſome People to traduce the Fame of their neighbor Nations. After this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the <hi>Neopolitans</hi> call the <hi>Venereous Evil,</hi> the <hi>French Pox,</hi> as if it were Natural and Common to the <hi>French.</hi> And on the contrary, the <hi>French</hi> to requite the Slander, term it the <hi>Neopolitan Scab.</hi> But of this enough.</p>
            <p>A Diſeaſ properly called Common, is either Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and Ancient, or Adventitious and New. The Original is that which from the firſt Inhabitation of the place hath infeſted the Inhabitants: of this kind perhaps is the Diſeaſ in the Throat called <hi>Branchocele</hi> among thoſe that dwell about the <hi>Alps;</hi> that burning Feaver which they call a <hi>Calenture,</hi> under the torrid <hi>Zone:</hi> the mortification of the parts under the cold <hi>Zones</hi> towards the Poles by extremity of cold.</p>
            <p>A Country Diſeaſ that is new and adventitious, is that which is brought into a Country by ſome common Cauſ. This is threefold, for either it proceedeth from
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:169706:111"/>
ſome Original fault of the Region, prevailing by the advantage of time againſt the health of the inhabitants, or from ſome alteration or innovation hapning to the Region it ſelf. Or from ſome incongruity between the Place and the complexion of the Natives.</p>
            <p>Firſt, A new common Diſeaſ invadeth a Country by ſome Original fault in proceſs of time prevailing more and more. For 'tis poſſible, that the firm and ſtrong Bodies of the firſt Inhabitants of any place may powerfully reſiſt the unwholſom influence of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and for many Ages may repel the invaſion of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, although their poſterity afterwards, in length of time, being by degrees changed in that peculiar Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the complexion wherby they maintained the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reſiſtance, may fall at laſt into ſome common Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſ. For the <hi>Plica</hi> of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the Scurvy, are common Diſeaſes to the <hi>Sarmatians, Polanders,</hi> and the Inhabitants of the <hi>Baltick</hi> Ocean, and they are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe new Diſeaſes, and (as all men confeſs) totally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Ancients. But to this day it is not known that any notable or remarkable Change or Innovation hath hapned to thoſe Regions before the breaking out of thoſe Diſeaſes, to which you might probably aſcribe the beginning of a new Diſeaſ. Wherfore we ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſay that thoſe new Diſeaſes did proceed from ſome ancient and original fault of the places: and yet that they did not bewray themſelves at firſt by reaſon of a peculiar reſiſtance made by the Natural ſtrength of the Inhabitants. For to this very day ſome Families in thoſe places are free from thoſe Diſeaſes, and very cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible it is that they may ſo perſevere, not yielding to the injuries or threatnings of the Region.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A new common Diſeaſ may reſult from the altered or innovated conſtitution of the place. Such
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:169706:111"/>
kind of innovations happen in Countries, either by Earthquakes, or Inundations of Water, or the burſting forth of ſome new pernicious Springs, or perhaps of ſome new Mineral Exhalations from the Caveous of the Earth, or from ſome malignant Aſpect of the Stars and the like Cauſes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A new common Diſeaſ may proceed from the incongruity of the Place with the complexion of the Natives. Such kind of Diſeaſes chiefly happen to Nations, when they tranſplant themſelves from one Region to another: eſpecially when the Conſtitutions of thoſe Countries which they go to poſſeſs, are very different from thoſe they forſook. So the Engliſh who firſt inhabited <hi>Virginia</hi> were frequently afflicted with a ſwelling of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and the <hi>Hypochondriacal</hi> parts; who upon their return to <hi>England</hi> were cured without any difficulty, but they who continued in <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia</hi> were not ſo eaſily reſtored to health.</p>
            <p>Moreover, National and common Diſeaſes differ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves. Becauſ ſome of them totally depend upon the inclemency of the Region, and others in part only. The mortification of the parts ſeemeth to be of the firſt kind which befalleth men in the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Tracts near the Poles. For the whol Eſſence of the Diſeaſ may be aſcribed to the cold and ſharpneſs of the Place. Of the ſecond kind the <hi>Venereous Pox</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Weſt-Indians</hi> ſeemeth to be. For there it is conceived to be partly gotten by impure Copulation, and partly to be contracted from the Inſalubrity of the place. In like manner the Bloody Flux is predominent in <hi>Ireland,</hi> depending partly upon the conſtitution of the place, partly upon an erroneous and prepoſterous diet. And thus much in general be ſpoken of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of common Diſeaſes. In the next place we muſt
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:169706:112"/>
enquire why this Diſeaſ is more rife in <hi>England</hi> than in other Regions? And by the way it muſt be obſerved, <hi>Whether, and how far forth this Diſeaſ may be ſaid to be Natural to Engliſh men?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, it muſt be obſerved, that <hi>England</hi> is an Iſland which borroweth ſome humidity from the adjacency of the Sea, and ſome frigidity from the diſtance from the <hi>Equator,</hi> then that it aboundeth with innumerable foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, diſcovering their Springs almoſt in al places. Laſtly, That it is watred with many and frequent ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of rain more than other Regions. All which things do ſufficiently atteſt the frigidity and humidity of the place. Seing therfore that a cold and moiſt diſtemper is a part of the Eſſence of this Diſeaſ, we may eaſily infer that the bodies of the Inhabitants are here more incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to thoſe diſtempers then in other hot and dry Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
            <p>If therefore you demand, <hi>Whether this Diſeaſ, at leaſt conſidered in this part of it, may rightly be ſaid to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to Engliſh men?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We anſwer,</hi> That in ſom ſort it may (although per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not properly) namely, ſo far forth as the ſame is attributed as natural to other Regions, alike cold and moiſt (although perhaps it may not yet be obſerved in them.) For thoſe Countries are as readily diſpoſed to imprint a cold and moiſt diſtemper as <hi>England</hi> it ſelf. Yet it muſt be obſerved, that a cold and moiſt diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is a common part of the Eſſence of this Diſeaſ, and that it alone doth not manifeſt the Affect, for every cold and moiſt diſtemper doth not introduce this evil. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although we grant, that an exceſs of cold and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture may be imputed as a fault to <hi>England,</hi> yet we deny that from thence it can be rightly inferred that the whol Diſeaſ is common and Natural to Engliſh men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:169706:112"/>
Moreover, Some Countries may perhaps be found out far exceeding <hi>England</hi> both in cold and moiſture, as <hi>Scotland, Holland, Zealand, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> and the like; wherin notwithſtanding this Diſeaſ hath not been obſerved to appear much. Therfore if this Diſeaſ be not rightly imputed to theſe Regions, wherein that common cauſe is predominant; namely, the exceſs of cold and moiſture. Certainly neither can it juſtly be imputed to <hi>England,</hi> by reaſon of that common Cauſe, which is here leſs prevalent. Again, The coldneſs and moiſtneſs of this Kingdom doth not ſo far tranſcend a a mediocrity, but that by outward and inwaad applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, exerciſes and the like; namely, a right uſe of the ſix things not Natural, they may be ſufficiently correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the caſhiering of that imputation, Wherefore if theſe things be ſo, namely, if a cold and moiſt diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per be only a common cauſe of the Diſeaſ, if other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions wherein this Affect hath not yet been obſerved to make any impreſſion, are at leaſt equally obnoxious to cold and moiſture: Finally, if thoſe diſtempers may be prevented by a Regiment of diet appropriated to the place; certainly the reaſon drawn from the coldneſs and moiſture of the Climate, which even now we produced to ſhew why Engliſh men ſhould be more frequently invaded with this Diſeaſ then others, will be very weak and inſufficient, ſo that we can by no means place our content in that alone, and therefore we intended no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more by that aſſignation, than that <hi>England</hi> doth more diſpoſe the Bodies of the Inhabitants to this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect than hotter and drier Regions do the Bodies of their Inhabitants. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o we proceed to the ſearch of the other cauſes of the rifeneſs and frequency of this Affect.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place we can note that <hi>England</hi> is very
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:169706:113"/>
ruitful and Child-breeding being ſufficiently favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both to Conception and Child-bearing, and not ubject to cauſe abortions. Now from hence it comes to paſs, that not only ſtrong and able bodied men, and ſuch as are endued with perfect health, but the weak and ſickly perſons do alſo generate; weak &amp; unſound women likewiſe, and ſuch as are prone to a conſumption, do conceive, carry their children nine months, and bring them forth in a decent and laudable manner. But it is no wonder if the Iſſue begotten by ſuch matter, and which oweth its life almoſt to the clemency of the place alone, ſhould be feeble and languid, and very ſubject to this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſ. For as much as the very benignity of the Region may in this reſpect be the occaſion of ſome infirmity in the Iſſue. For as barbarous People in time paſt by an inhumane experiment upon their new born infants; namely, by dipping their naked bodies in the coldeſt water, deſtroyed the weak ones with the extremity of the cold, and gave education only to the ſtrong ones, whoſe vigorous Conſtitutions overcame the injury of their cruel policies, purpoſing by that inhumanity to have an univerſal race of ſtrong &amp; luſty people. So on the contrary the very clemency of the place promiſcouſly preſerving the languiſhing and weak Children together with the ſtrong &amp; healthful, doth miniſter an occaſion of bringing forth a mixt kind of people ſome ſtrong and ſome weak and ſickly. Yet leaſt any ſhould miſtake, we do not mean that all the Children in this Kingdom which are born of weak and ſickly Parents are ſubject to this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. For although if one or both of the Parents be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, the Children will be infirm; yet it is often ſeen that when the Parents have been very ſtrong and healthful, yet their Children have been very ſubject to this Diſeaſ. Wherefore neither do we reſt in this ſecond cauſe, but
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:169706:113"/>
another muſt yet be enquired out, from whence we may derive a ſufficient reaſon of the frequency of this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</p>
            <p>We affirm therfore in the third place, That the rifeneſs of this Diſeaſ in <hi>England</hi> hath been much promoted, by that long and ſecure peace, which we enjoyed before the firſt breaking of it. For by this the more wealthy fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, which were firſt invaded by this evil, and which doth ſtil infeſt them more than others, had addicted themſelves to idleneſs and a looſe and effeminate life, and therupon they fel into a moiſter, ſofter, and degenerate Conſtitution, and ſuch as was leſs purged and cleanſed from excrementitious humors, and by conſequence their Children were even procreated obnoxious to this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. You wil ſay, that <hi>Scotland</hi> and the Northern parts of <hi>England,</hi> although they enjoyed peace and ſecurity, yet they are ſeldome obſerved to fal under this Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We anſwer,</hi> True it is that <hi>Scotland</hi> and the Northern parts of <hi>England</hi> are leſs affected with this Diſeaſ than the Southern and the Weſtern. In the mean time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure the firſt impreſſions and rudiments of it are far more frequent in thoſe places; yea, and in ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Countries, then is commonly beleeved. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this evil be very familiar in the South and Weſt parts of this Kingdom, and very wel known among the Vulgar ſort, yet we have many times ſeen Children af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with it in a ſlight manner, of whom neither the Parents nor others of the ſame family did ſuſpect the leaſt evil: Yea, we have known many, whom none of their friends thought to be affected, to be healed without any help of Phyſick by the ſole benefit of the increaſed heat, or by the increaſe of age or exerciſes. How much eaſier therfore may the firſt rudiments of this Diſeaſ be
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:169706:114"/>
concealed from them, to whom it is leſs familiar, and among whom it ſeldom aſcendeth to that degree, that they need to implore the Phyſitians help. We conjecture therfore that this Diſeaſ is more frequent then is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly beleeved both in <hi>Scotland</hi> and the Northern parts of <hi>England;</hi> yea, and in ſome Countries wherin the people are ignorant of it to this day: but in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they are ſo gently tormented with it, that they are ſeldom condemned to the hands of the Phyſitian. For that is the cuſtome of the Vulgar ſort, not to ſend for the Doctor (eſpecially to Infants and yong Children) unleſs the vehemency of the Diſeaſ conſtrain them. However the matter is, we ſeem not yet to have given ſatisfaction to the objection propounded, <hi>Why the South and Weſt Country men of</hi> England <hi>are more grievouſly &amp; frequently conflicted with this Diſeaſ, then the Northern People and the</hi> Scots, <hi>although both Kingdoms equally ſhared the bleſſing of the laſting peace and ſecurity.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we grant that a higher reaſon yet muſt be given for this difference. Fourthly, therefore and laſtly, we ſay, That the cauſe of this difference is the affluence of all good things in theſe Southern and Weſtern Countries of <hi>England.</hi> For this part of the Kingdom is much the more fruitful, rich and floriſhing, and abounding with al manner of allurements to pleaſure. Therefore it is no marvail if the cuſtoms of men do firſt generate here, their Spirits decay, and the ſtrength of their Bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to diſſolve now, that this degenerate and delicate manner of living doth weaken families, is a truth ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly and conſtantly atteſted by Hiſtorians, that it were an impertinence to offer any proof of it. For you may obſerve that the moſt Noble and Gallant Families have been very much reproached for theſe very cauſes; yea, and ſooner or latter ſomtimes totally extinguiſhed, and ſo much the ſooner as they have the more refuſed to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:169706:114"/>
labors, and to innure themſelvs to maſculine exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes. Neither are families ever plunged in a greater danger of degeneration, then when they abound with al good things, and lying open to plenty and ſecurity they are moſt powerfully invited to delicatneſs, idleneſs and effeminateneſs, without any labor, care, and ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Who was more rich, ſecure, and effeminate, than <hi>Solomon?</hi> He left <hi>Rehoboam</hi> a degenerate Son behind him. And perhaps the family of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct for the like cauſe. We could heap up almoſt innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable examples to prove this, if it were needful. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, we ſee plainly, that this Diſeaſ doth more frequently and vehemently invade the families of the wealthy, than the cottages of poor men, and therfore it ought not to ſeem ſtrange that it likewiſe infeſted the richer and more pleaſanter parts of the Kingdom; nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the South and Weſt, before the North parts. But theſe things ſhall ſuffice to have been ſpoken concerning this matter. It remaineth only that we enquire, <hi>Whether and how far the three laſt aſſigned cauſes relate to the denomination of a Common Diſeaſ, and whether in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of them, this Diſeaſ may be aſcribed to</hi> England <hi>as common and Natural?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You muſt know then that theſe three cauſes in as much as they depend upon the Region, are not properly cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, neither by their own nature do they produce this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but that they are only an occaſion wherby this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſ may accidentally ariſe. For in themſelves they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note the laudable conditions of a Country, at leaſt they infer not what is culpable in it. For who can accuſe his Country, becauſe it favoreth the procreation of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, much leſs make outcries againſt it, becauſe it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed long and ſecure peace. Finally leaſt of all calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate the pleaſantneſs, fruitfulneſs, and affluence of all
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:169706:115"/>
good things: For all theſe things are in themſelves bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and conditions to be wiſhed for in a Country. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therfore as we have ſhewed above, that a Diſeaſe properly common doth imprint ſom mark of a vitious Conſtitution to the place to which it is aſcribed; It is impoſſible that any Diſeaſ can be attributed unto it as properly Common, by reaſon of the commodity of the Region. Wherfore (that we may comprehend all in a word) although this Diſeaſ in reſpect of the coldneſs and moiſtneſs thereof have a fomentation in the very Conſtitution of the Country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Although alſo that it borrow three other occaſions of invading from the Country; Yet ſeing that thoſe diſtempers may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by a due obſervation of the Regiment of Health appropriated to the place; and ſeing that the three other occaſional cauſes, are not properly blamable, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, we muſt affirm that this Diſeaſ is not properly Common to <hi>England.</hi> And ſo we have put an end to the ſearch of the cauſes of this Diſeaſ.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XX. The differences of the Diſeaſ, called the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chites.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are many differences of the <hi>Rachites</hi> in regard of the concourſe of ſeveral evils, and more than any man would eaſily imagine; ſome wherof are of great importance, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers leſs conſiderable we have reſolved here briefly to propound the chiefeſt. For the knowledg of them is not only profitable to define the <hi>prognoſtical</hi> cauſes, wherby the various events of a Diſeaſ are diſtinctly fortold ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe differences; but it alſo much conduceth both to the prevention and the cure of a Diſeaſ; namly, that by a conſideration of them apt and fit remedies may be choſen.</p>
            <p>Now theſe differences ariſe either from the Eſſence of the Diſeaſ, or from the cauſes therof: or laſtly, from Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes conjoyned with it. The Eſſence of a Diſeaſ may va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many ways: Firſt, By reaſon of the parts of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary Eſſence either preſent or abſent. Secondly, In regard of the magnitude of it. Thirdly, In reſpect of the vehemence. Fourthly, in regard of the Spirits; And fiftly in reſpect of the times.</p>
            <p>We grant indeed, That there is a certain agreement between ſom differences comprehended under theſe ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles; yet ſeing that the formal conceptions of them are diſtinct, it muſt be confeſſed that they deſerve diſtinct
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:169706:116"/>
conſiderations. For although a Diſeaſ, even in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reſpect may be called greater, becauſe it containeth many parts of the Secondary Eſſence in the ſame Patient yet this is a different &amp; diſtinct conſideration from that of the magnitude of that Affect. For the magnitude pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly hath reſpect unto the degree of receſs from the Natural State, and not to the Nature of the part of the Eſſence either preſent or abſent, for hereupon reſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth more then a gradual difference. In like manner ſome of the other differences do perhaps ſignify the ſame thing, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> concrete and reſtrained acception, which notwithſtanding in an abſtracted and formal conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion denote a diverſity. But let us proceed.</p>
            <p>The firſt difference of this Diſeaſ is that which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from the preſence of few or many of the parts of the Secondary Eſſence therof. For although all the parts of the Primary Eſſence are perpetuàlly preſent with the Diſeaſ it ſelf, yet there is no neceſſity that all the parts of the Secondary Eſſence ſhould be always preſent. For theſe are after-comers to the firſt Eſſence, and do by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees come upon it: Yea, ſome of them may be ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intercepted by the intervention of reſiſting cauſes that they may not at all appear. Hither you may refer that difference, which we propounded at the foot of the precedent diſputation, and which we ſhewed might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though indeed very rarely, befal thoſe that were grown to ful age. But becauſe our purpoſe here is only to handle the Diſeaſ as it is incident to Children, we ſhall be content to paſs by that difference thus noted by the way. But even in Children themſelves there ſomtimes happen ſome parts of the Secondary Eſſence, which have a moſt ſtrict conjunction with the Primary Eſſence, at leaſt they ſucceed them in the order of Nature. For the Primary Eſſence hath the efficacy of a cauſe, which in
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:169706:116"/>
Nature doth ever go before the effect. But in order of time ſome parts of the Secondary Eſſence do conſpire as it were, and concur with the Primary Eſſence in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion; and others again do come afterwards, theſe we muſt here diſtinguiſh. For the former ſort are abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſeparable, the latter ſort ſeparable from this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
            <p>The inſeparable parts of the Secondary Eſſence may be reduced to theſe Heads. Firſt to the afflicted <hi>Tone</hi> of the firſt affected parts. Secondly, to the unequal and imperfect diſtribution of the Vital Blood. Thirdly, to the too ſmal participation of the Vital influx in the firſt affected parts. Fourthly, to the Secondary faults of the Animal Conſtitution. Theſe faults are ſufficiently unfolded above in our diſcourſe of the Secondary Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of this Diſeaſ; where likewiſe becauſe of their ſtrict carriage with the Primary Eſſence, any man may perceive with eaſ (though they have a caſual dependance upon the Primary Eſſence) that they begin together at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>But al the Organical faults which we have alſo already recited, are found to be ſeparable, and ſomtimes actually ſeparate from this Diſeaſ. For the magnitude of the Head, and the leanneſs of the Joynts, the crookedneſs of the Shank-bone, or the Elbow, the inflexions of the Joynts, the ſharpneſs of the Breaſt, do not neceſſarily accompany this Diſeaſ preſently from the beginning, but in proceſs of time they bewray themſelves by degrees and ſupervene upon the Affect. And although the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the parts, which in ſome ſort hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence into the ſaid faults, may be ſaid to be preſent in ſome ſlight degree from the begining of the Diſeaſ, yet is it indeed only a Symptom, and not a Diſeaſ; neither is it able preſently to produce thoſe Diſeaſes of magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:169706:117"/>
Figure and Place. Moreover it is not neceſſary, that theſe Organical faults ſhould equally and at the ſame time invade one that hath the <hi>Rachites,</hi> we grant indeed that the extenuation of the firſt affected parts, when the Diſeaſ is of ſome continuance, doth alwaies and neceſſarily ſucceed it, neither can it afterwards up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the perſeverence of the Diſeaſ be removed, that it is likewiſe a principal part of the ſeparable parts of the ſecondary Eſſence; yea that the extenuation whilſt it is making doth immediatly follow the ſmalneſs of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the firſt affected parts, almoſt no otherwiſe than the ſmalneſs of nouriſhment immediatly followeth the primary Eſſence of the Diſeaſ in the ſaid parts; but withal we affirm that the extenuation being made which is it ſelf a ſecondary part of the Diſeaſ wherof we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſ, doth neceſſarily preſuppoſe the motion and time of the Diſeaſ, and that it cannot be in the firſt moment of the exiſtence of the Diſeaſ. We ſay moreover that Phyſitians do not acknowledg any change made in the parts expoſed to the ſenſ, which doth not yet appear to the ſenſe, and by conſequence they affirm that extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion befalleth the firſt affected parts, til it be made ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the ſenſes which certainly doth neceſſarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>require ſome duration of the Diſeaſ. But the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionat magnitude of the Head, doth begin almoſt at the ſame time with that extenuation of the firſt affected parts, but it may ſo fall out, if a conſuming Phtiſick be joyned together with this Diſeaſ, that that magnitude of the Head may vaniſh before death, as we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy proved by one example in our <hi>Anatomical Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> The Magnitude of the Head therfore is more ſeparable from this affect than the extenuation of the firſt affected parts, for this cannot be removed without the Diſeaſ be cured. The ſticking out of the Bones
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:169706:117"/>
appear ſomtimes ſooner, ſomtimes later, and they ſomtimes grow out more, ſomtimes leſs, but upon any long continuance of the Diſeaſ they are ſeldom (if ever) ſeen to be abſent. The narrowneſs of the Breaſt doth not appear, but after a long time when the Diſeaſ is confirmed, and for the moſt part is the forerunner of a Ptyſick. Again, the crookedneſs of the Bone in the Arm, and the Shank-bone, as alſo the inflexion of the Joynts may be abſent through the whol courſ of the Diſeaſ, and may be more or leſs preſent, and indeed is the moſt chanceable among thoſe things which follow this affect. We conclude therfore that theſe Organical parts of the Secondary Eſſence are ſeparable after that manner as we have ſaid, and as a more or fewer of them are preſent, ſo the Difference of the Diſeaſ is conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as being more or leſs compounded.</p>
            <p>The Second Difference of this Diſeaſ reſulteth from the magnitude therof. And the magnitude is eſtimated from the greater or leſſer receſs from the natural condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. There is a vaſt difference in this Diſeaſ in reſpect of the magnitude. For ſome are ſo gently affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with it that you would ſcarce ſuppoſe them to be ſick. They complain of nothing, they eat, they drink, they ſleep like thoſe that are ſound in health; only they play with more unchearfulneſs, and ſhew forth ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very ſlight ſigns of ſickneſs, By the only benefit of Nature likewiſe without any aſſiſtances of Art they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly recover, neither their Parents, Nurſes, nor the By-ſtanders ſo much as once ſuſpecting that they are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with this evil. On the contrary, Others are ſo vehemently afflicted that they cannot be reſcued from death or the danger of imunient death by the moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved remedies.</p>
            <p>The Third Difference is from the vehemence of the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:169706:118"/>
affect. Now this is valued by the violent motion of the Diſeaſ and the reſiſtance of Nature, and alſo by the ſharpneſs of the conflict of theſe things among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. This Diſeaſ, although it be otherwiſe very great, yet is it ſlow in motion unleſs ſome fewer, or ſome other urgent affect be conjoyned with it, and ſtir up the Nature of it to a fiercer oppoſition, yet is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therof ſomtimes more vehement, and ſomtimes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dull, and thereupon it happeneth to be differenced.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Difference, is from the ſtrength of the ſick Child or Infant. This is eſtimated by the greater or leſſer preſence of thoſe things which are according to Nature. Hither belongeth the condition of the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament, the plenty of inherent Spirits, the activity and ſtrength of the <hi>Tone,</hi> the vigor of the Vital and Animal Conſtitution, and the ſtructure of the Organs. For as theſe are more or leſs obedient to the preſcriptions of Nature, ſo their Spirits ought to be judged more or leſs ſtrong, and according to them the evil muſt be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the more or leſs dangerous. For this cauſ the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Children <hi>caeteris paribus</hi> are more dangerouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected than the elder.</p>
            <p>The Fifth Difference, is from the times of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſ. And this difference in a qualified and limited ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception includeth almoſt all the precedent; for what difference ſoever hapneth to any Diſeaſ, muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happen at ſome time of the Diſeaſ. Phyſitians reckon up four times of a Diſeaſ: The Begining, the Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, the Conſiſtance, and the Declination. But it muſt be noted that Phyſitians are not ſo exact in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing the ſeaſons of things as the Phyloſophers, for they do not reſtrain the beginning of a Diſeaſ to that point of time wherin the Diſeaſ begineth; but ſo far they extend it, till there appear ſo great an alteration
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:169706:118"/>
of the Diſeaſ, that it may be known by certain and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible evidences. For the indiviſible begining is not the time, wherin the Phyſitians help is perfected, and why ſhould that diſtinction of a Diſeaſ be profitable which could not be grounded upon any alteration of it known to us?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Galen</hi> therfore hath rightly deduced the times of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and Inflamations from the underſtandible alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them: that is, The begining from the crudity of the matter cauſing the diſeaſ, the augmentation from the manifeſt coction therof; the ſtate from the Excretion, and the Declination he computes from the Reduction of the Reliques to the Natural ſtate; and indeed theſe times do ſweetly agree in the general, and differ in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular from the crudity and coction of Feavers and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamations. But the truth is, That this diſtinction of times hath not the like ſucceſs in many other diſeaſes: For in theſe Nature doth not ſo regularly proceed from crudity to coction, ſo to expulſion, and at laſt to redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; neither by theſ can we truly and ſafly know the progreſs of the diſeaſ. Other alterations therfore of theſe Diſeaſes, ſuch as are more cleer and eaſily known muſt be weighed. Yet we grant that even theſ diſeaſes when they are directed to health, do run thorow thoſe four ſeaſons, the begining, the augmentation, the ſtate or conſiſtence, and the declination. But when they tend to the deſtruction of the Patent, they ſcarce attain to the conſiſtance, but are daily more and more augmented e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the leſt period of life. Wherfore in theſ the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation admitteth the greateſt latitude, neither doth it deſerv a higher difference, or a lower ſubdiviſion: but when an indifferent ſtate of a diſeaſ of the ſame kind is made the Middle term between the begining and the end of ſuch an augmentation, than we can convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:169706:119"/>
diſtinguiſh. The encreaſ into an augmentation on this ſide, or beyond, or beneath, or above the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence. An encreaſ of the firſt kind about the conſiſtance we may cal a <hi>ſimple encreaſ,</hi> in regard that it differeth not from the thing it ſelf commonly received by that name, an encreaſ beyond or above the ſtate, we call an encreaſ <hi>excreſcent, exceſſive, tranſcendent</hi> and <hi>deſperate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, Two kinds of declination may be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in a Diſeaſ. The firſt is legitamate when the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſ ſimply declineth towards health and recovery. The later is ſpurious, when a diſeaſ remitting changeth into another of a different kind. And ſo although there are in thoſ that recover health, only four times of a diſeaſ, yet in others two more differences may be diſcerned: Yet it muſt be noted, that theſ ſix times are never to be found in the ſame diſeaſ, or the ſame patient, but where there is the ſame diſeaſ in the Species in divers ſubjects. Let us now apply theſe things to the preſent affect. We affirm therfore that ſix differences of this diſeaſ do oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in reſpect of the times therof. For it hath a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and may be called <hi>incipient:</hi> it hath an encreaſ, and may be ſaid to be <hi>confirmed;</hi> it hath a ſtate, and then it it may be termed <hi>conſiſtant;</hi> it hath an encreaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſtate, and may be called <hi>deſperate:</hi> it hath a tru declination, and may be ſaid to be an affect remiting or ſimply declining; and it hath a ſpurious declination, and may be called a change, as when it chancheth into ſom other diſeaſ. Of al which we wil ſpeak in their order.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The <hi>Rachites</hi> is called a Diſeaſ begining, when the firſt Rudiments and impreſſions thereof are, though very obſcurely, firſt obſerved, and before there hapneth any manifeſt extenuation of the firſt affected parts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This diſeaſ is ſaid to be confirmed, when an evident and manifeſt extenuation of the firſt affected
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:169706:119"/>
parts becoms obvious to the Senſes. And here the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> perceiveth we do not diſtinguiſh theſ two times from crudity and coction, but from another alteration of the Body, namly, The Extenuation made in the parts firſt affected; for the begining of this diſeaſ can no ways be diſcerned from the encreaſ therof by crudity and cocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But otherwiſe, ſo far as the nature of the thing is capable of it, we ſhal willingly follow the example of <hi>Galen,</hi> and as he diſtinguiſheth the encreaſ from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining by the manifeſt coction, ſo we alſo put a different between theſ times in this affect from a manifeſt altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, namly, the extenuation made in the ſaid parts.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This diſeaſ advanced to its conſiſtence, is that, which having attained the higheſt vigor and exhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, is arreſted, and for a time is neither ſenſibly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, or leſſened, but continueth at a ſtand.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This diſeaſ exceeding the Mediocrity of the conſiſtance is called deſperat, namly, Becauſ in mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude and vehemence it ſurpaſſeth the very ſtate of the ſame diſeaſ in another Patient indifferently affected, and withal is continually encreaſed, neither is there any hope but that it will daily encreaſ til it hath altogether ſubdued and diſſolved the Patient For which cauſ this condition of a diſeaſ is termed deſperat.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, This diſeaſ is ſaid to be truly remitting or declining, when the Eſſence therof is by little and little diminiſhed, and when the Signs and Symptoms of it are daily mitigated.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, This diſeaſ is ſaid to be illegitimatly decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or paſſing into another diſeaſ of a diverſ ſpecies, when the Eſſence, Signs and Symptoms therof are ſo leſſened, that new ones of a different kind, and perhaps more outragious appear in their ſtead. Thus the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chites</hi> frequently degenerat into a Conſumption, a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:169706:120"/>
and ſomtimes perhaps into a ſlow putrid Feaver; yet for the moſt part the ſame diſeaſ doth accompany theſ ſupervening affects to the diſſolution of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. And let this ſuffice concerning the differences of this diſeaſ deduced from the Eſſence.</p>
            <p>This diſeaſ in like manner in reſpect of the Cauſes is as it were taken into pieces, or divided into parts, namly into a natural affect, and into an after-coming or new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contracted malady. Again, This diſeaſ may be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med natural in a twofold ſenſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In the firſt properly, As when the Sick is born actually affected with this diſeaſ. In the later improperly, when the Patient at his birth is not actually affected with it, but ſtrongly diſpoſed by his native principles to fall into it. If it pleaſ the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſummon thoſe things to his memory which were ſaid above concerning the cauſes of this Effect on the Parents parts, he wil eaſily conceive the reaſon and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of this difference, and conſequently that wil ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe us from any further explication: Only we ad, that this difference is of great uſe in the judicial part of cure, which conſiſteth in applications antidotal and preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, but it is not of ſo great moment in the Method of Cure. In like manner this Affect is meerly coming af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when being fomented by no Natural diſpoſition, it is newly contracted after the birth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; here alſo it is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. For it either ſucceedeth ſom foregoing Diſeaſ; or it is immediatly produced by an erroneous uſe of the ſix non-Natural things: We have ſufficiently diſcourſed of both, where we hammered out the cauſes of this Diſeaſ after the birth, and thither we direct the Reader.</p>
            <p>Again, this Diſeaſ admitteth ſom differences by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of other Diſeaſes wherwith it is conjoyned in the ſame ſubject. It muſt not be expected that we ſhould give in a Catalogue of all Diſeaſes, wherwith this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:169706:120"/>
may poſſibly be conjoyned, we ſhal only reckon up thoſe which ate the uſual Companions of this Malady<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Som wherof have a certain dependance upon this Diſeaſ and the cauſes of it; others have not any, or at leaſt not any worthy of a diſtinct conſideration.</p>
            <p>Of the former kind are a <hi>Hydrocephalus, the faults of breeding Teeth, an Aſthma, the Ptyſick, an Hectik fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, a ſlow, and erratical Feaver, and the Aſcites,</hi> which is that kind of Dropſy when water hath gotten between the fleſh and the Skin.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hydrocephalus</hi> hath a great correſpondence with this Affect, ſeing that this Affect alſo doth for the moſt part ſuppoſe an increaſ of the Head preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally encreaſed, and an overplentiful afflux of the Blood unto the Brain by reaſon of the largeneſs of the Arteries thither extended. And hereupon it eaſily coms to paſs that the Brain being oppreſſed w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the abundance of the Blood, muſt ſomtimes needs ſuffer the more ſerous por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therof (as being the moſt permeable) to evaporate or ſweat out into the Ventricles and cavities within the <hi>Menynges,</hi> and by conſequence to produce the Dropſy of the Brain. But this, as we have already noted, doth always appear.</p>
            <p>The <hi>faults of breeding of Teeth</hi> alſo are ſomtimes juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſcribed to this Diſeaſ going before. For it is well known that they who are affected with this Diſeaſ do commonly breed Teeth with extream pain, and many times the Teeth themſelvs fal out by pieces. But we have above reduced this fault to the unequal nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the parts, and there the Reader may find further ſatisfaction. In the mean time it muſt be obſerved, that a painful breeding of Teeth may likewiſe precede this Diſeaſ, and ſuſtain the force of a cauſ in reference to this ſubſequent evil, as we have likewiſe ſhewed above.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:169706:121"/>
Moreover, An <hi>Aſthma</hi> or difficulty of breathing doth familiarly follow upon this Affect, becauſe the Blood is ſomwhat cooled in his circulation thorow the firſt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted parts, and is rendred more thick, viſcous, and ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh in motion, neither is it always perfectly corrected before its return to the right Ventricle of the Heart. Wherupon being unapt for paſſage, it is powred back from the right Ventricle thorow the Arterious Vein in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſubſtance of the Lungs, and for that Reaſon doth eaſily introduce obſtructions, hard tumors, difficulty of breathing, ſomtimes inflammations, impoſtumes, Ulcers, the Ptyſick, the Dropſy of the Lungs, a Hectick Feaver, or elſ a ſlow erratical Feaver.</p>
            <p>An <hi>Aſcites</hi> is alſo ſomtimes conſociated with this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. But whether it proceeds from a copious flowing of the Blood to the Bowels of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> we dare not yet atteſt for an undoubted truth. Yet certain it is that the flowing of the Blood to this Belly is very copious and ſufficiently active in this Diſeaſ. For the Liver is great, and the other Bowels are obſerved to be rather more ful than ordinary, than pined away. Wherupon it may happen, that that watry moiſture from the Bowels which are oppreſſed with a fulneſs may be carried into the hollowneſs of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> but we affirm this with a diſtruſtful confidence, becauſe we have not yet given our ſelvs ful ſatisfaction in this matter.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs theſe recited Diſeaſes may happen to Children although the <hi>Rachites</hi> have not preceded, and may be the cauſ to introduce it. Yea, they may likewiſe com upon this Diſeaſ from other cauſes; as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by ſom errors in the Regiment of health; although in this caſe alſo this Affect may be partly guilty, if it went before: And thus much of complicated Diſeaſes of the former kind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:169706:121"/>
But of the latter kind, namely, ſuch as have little or no nependance upon this Affect, are <hi>a malignant Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the French Pox, the Scurvy, and the Strumaticall Affect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt it is certain, That <hi>a Malignant Feaver</hi> may come upon this Affect, becauſe for the moſt part it is produced by infection, from which this preſent Affect leaveth not Children free, we ad only, that this Feaver doth ſeldom or never ow his Origin to this Diſeaſ.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If the <hi>French Pox</hi> chance to be complicated with this Diſeaſ, it is either derived from the Nurſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or from the Parents by Inheritance. For it is a Diſeaſ altogether Diſtinct from this, and hath ſcarce any affinity with it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Scurvy</hi> is ſomtimes conjoyned with this Affect. It is either <hi>hereditary,</hi> or perhaps in ſo tender a Conſtitution <hi>contracted by infection,</hi> or laſtly, <hi>it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the indiſcreet and erroneous Regiment of the Infant, and chiefly from the inclemency of the Ayr and Climat where the Child is educated.</hi> For it ſcarce hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any greater commerce with this Diſeaſ, then with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diſeaſes of longer continuance, wherin after the ſame manner the Blood in time contracteth for the moſt part this peculiar infection, yet it muſt be granted, that this Affect doth ſomwhat the more diſpoſe to the <hi>Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi> in regard of the want of motion and exerciſe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, The <hi>Strumatical Affect</hi> doth ſomtimes aſſociate this evil. But it is credible that it ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more to other cauſes proper unto it, then to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Diſeaſ. Although we deny not, but this may mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſom occaſion of invading, in as much as it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth the humors more viſcous and groſs.</p>
            <p>Some other Diſeaſes are peradventure ſomtimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated with this, but becauſe they happen exceeding
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:169706:122"/>
rarely, and have yet ſcarce fallen under our obſervation, we paſs them by, for the preſent and proceed to the ſigns of the Diſeaſ, and the difference of the ſigns.</p>

            <p>We divide the <hi>Diagnoſtical</hi> Signs into <hi>Pathognomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical</hi> and <hi>Synedreontal.</hi> And here the Phyſical Authors ſeem to be more ſtrict in the definition of the word <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thognomonical,</hi> then the neceſſity of the nature of the matter doth require. For they wil have it to be <hi>Inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and</hi> (as Logicians ſpeak) <hi>Proprium quarto modo,</hi> that is, <hi>to agree, omni, ſoli, &amp; ſemper.</hi> Indeed it muſt be granted, that ſuch an Inſeparable Sign, or, <hi>Proprium quarto modo,</hi> muſt be according to the moſt proper ſenſ a <hi>Pathognomonical</hi> Sign. For whether it be preſent, or
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:169706:122"/>
whether it be abſent, it is ever demonſtratively ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant: When it is preſent it certainly witneſſeth the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the preſent malady, and being abſent it ſheweth that that ſpecies of the Diſeaſ is not preſent.</p>
            <p>But when we truly and ſeriouſly conſider how ſeldom ſuch Signs as theſe occur and of what uſeleſs conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they will prove, the knowledg of them being thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained; we are induced to think of the amplifying of the uſual ſignification of the word. For although the Ancients to ſupply this defect, did ſubſtitute <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> in the place of one true <hi>Pathognomoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>col</hi> Sign ſtrictly taken, and we our ſelvs do moſt willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accept of, and approve this very ſame <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; yet ſeing that this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> doth ſeldom appear from the begining of the Diſeaſ, and by conſequence ſeldom ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the reputation of an Inſeparable Sign, it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily followeth, that it alſo can but ſeldom perform the office of a Sign, <hi>quarto modo propriè,</hi> and therfore alſo that this notion is reduced to an extream narrow uſe. We are compelled therfore that we may fully prevent, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void this inconvenience to extend ſomwhat higher the ſignification of a <hi>Pathognomonical</hi> Sign; yet ſo, as that we wil abate nothing of the Nature and certitude of the ſignification.</p>
            <p>Therfore we define a <hi>Pathognomonical</hi> Sign to be ſomwhat appearing about the Patient, which certainly <hi>and infallibly demonſtrates the Species of the Diſeaſ,</hi> And in this extended ſenſ it may be divided into <hi>a Sign Inſeparable,</hi> or, <hi>proprium quarto modo, and a Sign Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable;</hi> namely, <hi>as being proper only, Modo ſecundo;</hi> to wit, <hi>becauſ it is competible only to one kind of Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, although not always.</hi> In like manner the <hi>Paththo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnomonical Syndrome,</hi> or <hi>Concourſ of Symptoms</hi> may be divided into two kinds, reſpectively Analogical to thoſe
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:169706:123"/>
aforeſaid. For ſomtimes it beginneth with the Diſeaſ it ſelf, and doth inſeparably aſſociate to the very laſt peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. So the pricking pain of the ſide, and acute Feaver, the difficulty of breathing, and the cough, if they be taken collectively, they are indeed a <hi>Syndrome,</hi> but ſuch an one as is always equivalent to one ſimple <hi>Pathogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monical</hi> Sign of the firſt kind, and doth inſeparably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company a Pleuriſie from the firſt beginning to the very end. But ſomtimes the <hi>Syndrome</hi> or concourſ of Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms is not compleat and perfect from the begining of the Diſeaſ, yet afterwards it is made perfect by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the other Signs, and doth infallibly denote, the ſpecies of the Diſeaſ. For example, in the ſmal Pox upon the firſt begining of the Diſeaſ, the <hi>Syndrome,</hi> is ſo incompleat, that it doth not yet certainly determine the ſpecies of the Diſeaſ; but afterwards the Pox break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Skin very thick, and tending to matura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then the <hi>Syndrome</hi> is finiſhed, and the ſpecies of the Diſeaſ is put out of al doubt.</p>
            <p>But that a Sign proper to one Diſeaſ alone (although not in the fourth manner) whether it be ſimple and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary, or compounded of a concourſ of many together, may ſuffice, when it is preſent to make a Sign truly <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thognomonical:</hi> It is manifeſt from hence, becauſ, when it is preſent, it doth as certainly and infallibly denote the ſpecies of the Affect, as a Sign doth, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the fourth manner. For that which agreeth to one ſpecies only, when it is preſent, doth neceſſarily infer the preſence of that ſpecies alſo. Although therfore that a Sign proper in the ſecond manner, be not Inſeparable, and where it is abſent, doth not determine the abſence of the Diſeaſ, as a Sign doth proper in the fourth man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; yet when it is preſent, it is as we have ſaid of the ſame valu and certainty. For Phyſitians do eſteem the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:169706:123"/>
dignity of the Sign by the certainty of the ſignification. For to that purpoſe they enquire out the ſigns of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſ, that they may attain to a certain knowledg therof. Therfore ſeing that Signs proper in the ſecond manner are equivalent in reſpect of their certainty, when they preſent to Signs proper in the fourth manner: we ſhall here comprehend them under the extended ſignification of <hi>Pathognomonical</hi> Signs.</p>
            <p>You may ſay after this manner many after appearing Signs may be reduced to the <hi>Pathognomonical</hi> and are confounded with them. Be it ſo, provided that they do infallibly denote the ſpecies of the Diſeaſ. For in this reſpect they are worthy to be ſevered from the other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appearing Signs, neither wil any confuſion follow hereupon in the method of the ſemeiotical art, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the valu and dignity of the Signs wil by that means be more plainly and eaſily obſerved.</p>
            <p>Of the <hi>Synedremontal</hi> or <hi>aſſident</hi> Signs we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of moment to ſay, but wil directly proceed to the Signs themſelvs as they are to be reduced into order. Yet no exact method muſt be expected from us, becauſe for the moſt part the Signs flow from ſo many ſeveral foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, that they wil ſcarce ſuffer themſelvs to be marſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into any accurate order. Wherfore, that they may be conſtituted which have ſome affinity among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs, we have reduced the ſigns of this Affect to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Method.</p>
            <p>We ſhal propound therfore</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Signs which relate to the Animal actions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Thoſe which have reference to the irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Nutrition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Thoſe that concern the Reſpiration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Thoſe that appertain to the Vital Influx.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Certain vagabond and fugitive Signs redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible</hi>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:169706:124"/>
               <hi>to no Claſſis.</hi> Under each of which we ſhal ſubjoyn the valu of the Signs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt the</hi> Diagnoſtical <hi>Signs relating to the Animal Actions, are theſe.</hi> The looſneſs and ſoftneſs of the parts. The debility and languidneſs. And finally, the ſlothful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtupefaction.</p>
            <p>Firſt, A certain laxity and ſoftneſs, if not a flaccidity of all the firſt affected parts is uſually obſerved in this Affect. The Skin alſo is ſoft and ſmooth to the touch, the muſculous fleſh is leſs rigid and firm; the joynts are eaſily flexible, and many times unable to ſuſtain the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Wherupon the Body being erected it is bent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or backwards, or to the right ſide or to the left.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A certain debility, weakneſs, and enervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on befalleth al the parts ſubſervient to motion. This weakneſs dependeth much upon the laxity, ſoftneſs, and litherneſs of the parts aforeſaid: for which reaſon we have placed thoſe Signs before this, as alſo this before the ſlothfulneſs and ſtupefaction in the next place to be enumerated, which ow much both to the looſneſs and ſoftneſs. Moreover, this debility begineth from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firſt rudiments of the Diſeaſ. For if Children be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted within the firſt year of their age or therabouts, they go upon their feet later by reaſon of that weakneſs, and for the moſt part they ſpeak before they walk, which amongſt us Engliſh men, is vulgarly held to be a bad <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> But if they be afflicted with this Diſeaſ, after they have begun to walk, by degrees they ſtand more and more feebly upon their legs, and they often ſtagger as they are going, and ſtumble upon every ſlight occaſion: neither are they able to ſuſtain themſelvs long upon their legs without ſitting, or to move and play up and down with an uſual alacrity, til they have reſted. Laſtly, upon a vehement increaſe of the Diſeaſ they totally loſe the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:169706:124"/>
uſe of their feet; yea, they can ſcarce ſit with an erected poſture, and the weak and feeble Neck doth ſcarcely, or not at al ſuſtain the burthen of the Head.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A kind of ſlothfulneſs and numbneſs doth invade the Joynts preſently after the begining of the Diſeaſ, and by little and little is increaſed, ſo that day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are more and more averſe from motion. The Yonger Children who are carried about in their Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes arms, when they are delighted and pleaſed with any thing do not laugh ſo heartily, neither do they ſtir themſelvs with ſo much vigor, and ſhake and brandiſh their little Joynts, as if they were deſirous to leap out of of their Nurſes hands, alſo when they are angred they do not kick ſo fiercely, neither do they cry with ſo much fierceneſs as thoſe who are in health. Being grown grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and committed to their feet, they run up and down with a wayward unchearfulneſs, they are ſoon weary, and they love to play rather ſitting then ſtanding, neither when they ſit, do they erect their body with vigor, but they bend it ſomtimes forwards, ſomtimes backwards, and ſomtimes on either ſide, ſeeking ſom props to lean upon that may gratify their ſlothfulneſs. They are not delighted like other Children with the agitation of their bodies, or any violent motion; yea, when the Diſeaſ prevaileth they are averſ from all motion of their limbs: crying as they are at any play that is never ſo little vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and being pleaſed again with gentle uſage and quiet reſt. In the interim, unleſs ſom other Diſeaſ, Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, or cauſ of ſickneſs doth com between, they are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in ſleeping and waking, they are ingenious, not ſtupid, but for the moſt part of forward wits, unleſs ſom other im pediments ariſe, their countenances are much more compoſed and ſevere than their age requireth, as if they were intent and ruminating upon ſom ſerious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:169706:125"/>
Theſe Signs being taken together, unleſs they reſult from ſome evident warineſs, or proceed from ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary affect of the Brain (which indeed hapneth very ſeldom in this tenderneſs of age) do conſtitute a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Pothognomonical</hi> Syndrom of the firſt kind, &amp; where they are preſent together, they certainly witneſs the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Diſeaſ, &amp; when they are abſent together they infallibly atteſt the Eſſence of this Diſeaſ. But if at any time a weariſomneſs do bewray any Feaveriſh, or any other like Signs, they may eaſily be diſtinguiſhed from theſe, both becauſe the reaſons of the wearineſs have gone before, and alſo becauſe the Signs from thence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing do ſuddenly break out, and aſſoon vaniſh. But in this affect the ſigns do invade by degrees, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, or elſe they are dayly more encreaſed. Now the primary Diſeaſes of the Brain are diſtinguiſhed by their proper Signs. And thus much of the Signs which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the Animal Actions.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Signs which belong to the diſproportioned Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Parts.</head>
               <p>Of how great moment the <hi>Alogotrophy,</hi> or unequal Nouriſhment of the Parts is in this affect, we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhewed; we ſhall here therfore proſecute thoſe ſigns which in ſome great meaſure depend upon it, and we ſhall preſent them as if they were to be beheld at one View.</p>
               <p>Firſt, there appeareth the unuſual bigneſs of the Head, and the fulneſs and lively complexion of the Face, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the other parts of the Body. But although this Sign may preſuppoſe ſome motion of the Diſeaſ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhine out, yet is the Diſeaſ ſo obſcure before the appearance of it, that it is accounted in a manner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceivable:
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:169706:125"/>
Therfore commonly this Sign ſheweth it ſelf more or leſs from the firſt beginning, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth till the departure of the affect, unleſs (as we have noted before) the pining of thoſe parts ſupervene from ſome other cauſ.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Fleſhy parts, eſpecially thoſe which are full of Muſcles beneath the Head which we have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted among the firſt affected, in the progreſs of the Diſeaſ are dayly more and more worn away, made thin and lean. This Sign doth not preſently ſhew it ſelf from the begining of the Diſeaſ, becauſ it pre-requireth ſome notable motion of the Diſeaſ before it evidently appeareth; yet in time it moſt certainly is expoſed to the ſenſes, and accompanieth the Diſeaſ to the laſt ſtep be it either to life or death; excellently demonſtrating the motion and degree of the Diſeaſ by its encreaſ. Moreover this Sign being conjoyned with the former doth at leaſt conſtitute a <hi>Pathognomonical</hi> Sign of the ſecond kind, that is ſuch an one as is proper to this Diſeaſ alone; and where they are preſent together they infallibly denote the preſence of this Diſeaſ, although upon their abſence they do not equally ſignifie the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Diſeaſ.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Certain ſwellings and knotty excreſcences, about ſome of the joynts are obſerved in this affect; theſe are chiefly conſpicuous in the Wreſts, and ſomwhat leſs in the Ankles. The like Tumors alſo are in the tops of the Ribs where they are conjoyned w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> grizles in the Breaſt. We have noted abov in our Anatomical Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations that theſe tumors are not ſcituated in the Parts, but in the very Bones; although this conſideration doth ſcarce belong to them as Signs, ſeing that of themſelves they are ſearce conſpicuous. This Sign doth alſo ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome kind of motion of the Diſeaſ, neither is it
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:169706:126"/>
emergent a <hi>Principio principiante,</hi> as the Phyloſophers phraſe it, yet it offers it ſelf as an object to the ſenſes ſooner than any conſiderable extenuation of the parts. But where it is preſent, it conſtitutes a <hi>Pathognomical</hi> Sign of the Second kind, and without diſpute witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Species of the Diſeaſ.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Some Bones wax crooked, eſpecially the Bones called the Shank-bone, and the Fibula or the ſmall Bone in the Leg, then afterwards the greater Shank-bone, and the undermoſt and leſſer of the two long Bones of the Elbow, but not ſo much altogether nor ſo often; ſomtimes alſo the Thigh-bone and the Shoulder-bone. Again, there is ſomtimes obſerved a certain ſhortning of the Bones and a defective growth of them in reſpect of their longitude. This by chance was omitted above, where we gave the Reaſon of the Organical faults. Yet this affect doth ſeem to depend upon the ſame irregular nouriſhment; namely ſo far forth as the nouriſhment taken in encrcaſeth the Bones according to breadth and thickneſs more than length. From hence it comes to paſs that ſome Children long afflicted with this Diſeaſ become Dwarfs. Hither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may be referred that folding in the Wreſts, the Skin it may be having better nouriſhment and more growth than the Bones of thoſe parts, wherupon it muſt needs be contracted in the Wreſts into a folding or wrinkledneſs. Finally, to this place alſo may belong a certain ſticking out of the Bones of the Head, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the Bone of the forehead forwards. For it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the common kind of viciated Figure and the <hi>Alogotrophy</hi> of the Bones. Yet this in the Bone of the Forehead doth evidently ſeem to depend upon the free nouriſhment of that Bone in his circumference, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it is coupled to the Bones of the fore part of the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:169706:126"/>
Head, and conſtitutes that ſeam called <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tura Coronalis,</hi> which lieth in the foremoſt parts therof. For herupon it muſt needs be thruſt forwards. And indeed in that place it is plentifully nouriſhed without any difficulty, becauſ this Bone in Children is cartilagineous towards that Seam. And this alſo was pretermitted above where we diſcourſed of the Organical faultineſs, becauſ we have but lately obſerved it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Teeth come forth both ſlowly and with trouble, they grow looſ upon every ſlight occaſion, ſomtimes they wax black, and even fall out by pieces. In their ſtead new ones come again though late and with much pain. This kind of Sign, as alſo that which we noted in the former Article, may be referred to the <hi>Synedremontal</hi> Signs, becauſ neither of theſe is either perpetually preſent, or if it be preſent, it doth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly confirm the preſence of Diſeaſ.</p>
               <p>Some have imagined that the Bones in this Diſeaſ are transfigurable like wax; But we have never ſeen it, neither have we received it from any eye witneſs who was not of ſuſpected credit. Wherfore we reject this Sign as altogether Fabulous.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The Breaſt in the higher progreſſion of the Diſeaſ, becomes narrow on the ſides, and ſticking up foreright, ſo that it may not be unaptly compared to the Keel of a Ship inverted, or the the Breaſt of a Hen or Capon. For on each ſide of the middle it riſeth up into a point, the ſides being as it were preſſed down. If any demand whether this Sign be ſolely apropriated and peculiar to this affect; We anſwer, That the Breaſt may be a little encreaſed in an Atrophy or Phtiſick, and leſs than the other parts of the Body, and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence it may be narrower: but it can ſcarce ſo fall out according to the change of the Figure without an

                  <hi>Alogotrophy,</hi> namely that which is proper to this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſ. Wherfore this Sign alſo when it is preſent, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the invaſion of it be tardy muſt be reputed a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thognomonical</hi> Sign of the ſecond kind, becauſ when it is preſent, it certainly denoteth the Species of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſ, though not on the contrary. And thus much of the Signs which have reference to the unequal nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <head>The Signs which belong to Reſpiration.</head>
               <p>Firſt, The narrowneſs and ſticking up of the Breaſt already mentioned muſt be hither referred, wherof we then diſcourſed at large.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A ſwelling of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Hypochondriacal</hi> parts, which hindreth the free motion of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> downwards, and by conſequence doth ſomwhat interrupt the breathing. Yet it muſt be noted that the <hi>Abdomen</hi> and the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondries</hi> alſo in reſpect of their outward parts appear very lean and extenuated, but inwardly, namly in thoſe parts which are contained in the Cavity of the <hi>Abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> they ſwell, from whence ariſeth this fulneſs. This ſwelling proceedeth partly from the windineſs of the Stomach and Guts, and partly from the bigneſs of the Liver and other Bowels. Somtimes alſo a watry moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture into the Cavity of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> introducing an <hi>Aſcites,</hi> joyneth in this conſpiracy. This Sign is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom abſent, and yet it muſt be numbred among the <hi>Pathognomonical</hi> Signs, becauſ it is common to many other Diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A Cough is frequently preſent in this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as alſo a difficulty of breathing, and many other faults of the Lungs, as Stoppings, hard Tumors, Impoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hums,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:169706:127"/>
Inflamations, a Coaleſence of them, with the <hi>Plura,</hi> and the like; Yet theſe ſcarce deſerve to be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned among Signs, becauſe of themſelvs (whilſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient liveth) they are not ſufficiently conſpicuous.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Children afflicted with this Diſeaſ are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>averſ from lying upon their Sides either the right or the left, or at leaſt it is troublſom to them; namly, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſ of the Coaleſence of the Lungs with the <hi>Plura,</hi> or by reaſon of ſom Tumor on the contrary ſide, but to lie with their Faces upwards they are very much delighted. And theſ ſigns alſo being taken together wil not amount to <hi>pathognomonical</hi> ſigns of either kind, but <hi>ſyndrecion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> only and are common to other Diſeaſes.</p>

               <head>Signs belonging to the Vital Influx.</head>
               <p>Firſt, The Veins and the Arteries are more ſlender than ordinary in the firſt affected parts, and leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous than you would expect in a lean Body. But in the Face (reſpect being had to the gracility aforeſaid in the other part) they exceed the juſt proportion. This perhaps is a <hi>pathognomonical</hi> ſign, although it be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be obſerved, and indeed not yet ſufficiently ſifted by us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Pulſ in the Wreſts, and the other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected parts is ſmal &amp; weak, otherwiſe perhaps it is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derat, unleſs when a Feaver is preſent.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A moderate Ligature caſt about the Elbow or the Knee, doth not ſo ſoon ſwel and color the part beneath and above the Ligature with Bloud, as it doth in other ſound Children of the ſame age.</p>

               <p>Secondly, The Excrements of the Belly and Bladder do commonly reſemble theirs that are in health, unleſs ſome other Diſeaſ do interdict it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is obſerved, that thoſe which are ſick of this diſeaſ do abominat ſweet things, as Syrups, and Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets condited with much Sugar or Honey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Perhaps al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſuch things as theſe are hurtful for them, as alſo for thoſe which are troubled with the Scurvy, becauſe they thicken the humors.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E ſhal inſiſt in the ſame Method we propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded above, wher we diſcourſed of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, whoſe Signs we now enquire after. We have above deduced five differences from the very Eſſence of the Diſeaſ. The firſt was ſeparable from the parts of the Secondary Eſſence, whether they were preſent or abſent. But no other Signs muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected beſides the very pars <hi>preſent</hi> or <hi>abſent,</hi> which of themſelvs are ſubjected to the ſenſes, and therfore they are numbred among the <hi>Diagnoſtical</hi> Signs in the ſecond Claſſis in in the precedent Chapter.</p>
            <p>The ſecond difference was from the magnitude of the Diſeaſ; the ſigns of this are many and great, or few and gentle and preſent ſigns; namely, to be fetched from among the <hi>Diagnoſtical</hi> Signs above deſcribed.</p>
            <p>The third difference was taken from the vehemence of the affect. This is diſtinguiſhed by <hi>the ſlow or quick encreaſ of the</hi> Diagnoſtical <hi>Signs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth was from the ſtrength of the Sick; we have ſhewed the way to judg of the ſtrength above: But the difference of a Diſeaſ ariſing from hence hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto the <hi>danger,</hi> and therfore we refer the Signs therof to the <hi>Prognoſticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fifth difference was deduced from the times of the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:169706:129"/>
Diſeaſ. In which reſpect we have above reckoned up ſix divers apparitions of this Diſeaſ: to wit, <hi>The begining, the encreaſ, the ſtate or conſiſtence, the encreaſ beyond the State, the true declination, the ſuperious declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the paſſing into another affect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It muſt be known that the beginning of this Diſeaſ, beſides the ſigns that difference this time from the encreaſe, doth likewiſe require ſome peculiar Signs of the preſence of this Diſeaſ: for it is a time of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt obſcurity, wherin the Diſeaſ doth as it were lurk and hide it ſelf, neither can an unattentive and in expert Phyſitian eaſily diſtinguiſh it from the <hi>Diagnoſtical</hi> Signs above reherſed. For by this time moſt of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agnoſtical</hi> Signs aforeſaid do not yet openly break forth; and ſuch as make a diſcovery of themſelves, preſent on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome obſcure impreſſions to the Phyſitians Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therfore the indication of this time requires an accurate and <hi>peculiar collection of the firſt appearing Signs, and a diligent conſideration of them;</hi> but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times, beſides the <hi>Diagnoſtical</hi> Signs above gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, want only a difference among themſelves, which is performed by an eaſie induſtry. Wherfore in the firſt place we will declare the Signs of the preſence of this Diſeaſ, being newly begun or rather beginning, and then the difference between that and the encreaſ.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Signs of the preſent Diſeaſ of the <hi>Rachites</hi> newly begun.</head>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Diligent Obſervation muſt be employed about the three kinds of Signs aſcribed above to the Animal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;</hi> namely, the looſneſs and ſoftneſs of the parts, the weakneſs and languidneſs, the ſlothfulneſs and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For theſe do in a remiſs degree, and ſubobſcurely
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:169706:129"/>
yield advantage to circumſpection and heedfulneſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently a <hi>principio principiante,</hi> as they phraſe it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The colour muſt be conſidered, and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the Head and Face in relation to the Joynts.</hi> For if the colour or the habit be more freſh and lively in thoſe than in theſe, it preſenteth a ſtrong ſuſpition that this Diſeaſ hath taken root. For although the Bulk of the Head which is evidently encreaſed, and alſo the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuation of the parts affected do pre-require ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable motion and duration of the Diſeaſ before they appear, yet from the beginning a certain difference may be obſerved by an accurate attention or intuition in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the heat and the habit of theſe parts compared one with another.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Wreſts and the extremities of the Ribs muſt be noted.</hi> For before the end of the beginning cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain rudiments of knurls or knots begin to appear in the Wreſts, and Excreſcencies alſo in the tops of the Ribs.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>A kind of ſwelled fulneſs and ſtretching the Belly</hi> is conſpicuous immediately after the beginning e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in the <hi>Hypochondriacal</hi> parts. For the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Belly compared with the magnitude of the Breaſt exceeds the juſt and due proportion.</p>
               <p>Now theſe Signs collectively taken do aſſuredly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the preſence of the Diſeaſ even from the very beginning. But if no ſenſible and manifeſt extenuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the firſt affected parts do appear at the ſame time, in that very reſpect it is cleerly diſtinguiſhed from the encreaſ therof.</p>
               <p>The Signs of the other times are with eaſ differenced from one another by the deſcriptions of thoſe times al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready laid down; yet becauſ they may point to this place, and be diſpatched in a word, we ſhall not decline the Annotation of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:169706:130"/>
All thoſe Signs which appeared at the beginning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more intenſe and evident in the encreaſ of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſ, and many other and more grievous are daily accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated. This time, as hath been ſaid, is diſtinguiſhed by the manifeſt extenuation of the firſt affected parts; but after the conſiſtence by the continual aggravation of the Symptoms and Signs aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>In the State of the Diſeaſ the Signs and Symptoms are moſt outragious and conſpicuous. But ſo long as this time laſteth it neither manifeſtly encreaſeth or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth.</p>
               <p>In the encreaſ beyond the State, the Signs and Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms exceed that condition which they retained in the indifferent State, <hi>both in reſpect of their magnitude and vehemence, and likewiſe in reſpect of the dejection of the Spirits, and from that time forwards they dayly grow worſe and worſe;</hi> for which conſiderations this time is diſtinguiſhed, as well from the ordinary encreaſ, as from the means of the conſiſtence.</p>
               <p>But in a true declination <hi>A kind of ſimple remiſſion of the Symptoms and Signs tending to a perfect reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of health</hi> begins to diſcover it ſelf; no other Signs of the invaſion of any other Diſeaſ appearing.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, in a ſpurious and illegitimate decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>Other Signs of a new and ſucceeding affect are involved and complicated with the Signs and Symptoms of this Diſeaſ:</hi> and theſe are diſtinguiſhed according to the various condition therof, and muſt be fetched from their proper Fountains, and ought not to be expected here. Moreover, if any particular Signs of any of theſe times do occur, which concern the event of the Diſeaſ, they muſt be reſerved among the <hi>Prognoſticks;</hi> and thus much of the Signs of the Differences of this affect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the Eſſence therof.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:169706:130"/>
The Differences of the Cauſes diſtinguiſh the Diſeaſ into Natural and Accidental, and the Natural again into that which is properly ſo called, and that which is ſo termed improperly. A Natural Diſeaſ properly ſo called, becauſ it is ſuppoſed to be actually preſent from the very Birth, requireth no other Signs than the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agnoſtical</hi> recited in the former Chapter. For upon their appearance preſently after the Birth the Diſeaſ is certainly known to be Natural.</p>
               <p>But if thoſe Signs appear not preſently after their Birth, yet a Natural diſpoſedneſs to this Diſeaſ may be inherent from the Birth, which afterwards actually breaketh out, and the Diſeaſ produced by it, may (though with ſome impropriety) be termed Natural, in regard of that dependance upon the Native faultineſs. A Natural Diſeaſ in this ſenſ, requireth other Signs than thoſe which we have recited above, to diſtinguiſh it from the ſame Diſeaſ when it is altogether and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Accidental.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>If the elder Brothers or Siſters were before affected with the ſame Diſeaſ;</hi> for then it may well be ſuſpected that ſome Infection was contracted from the Parents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> If no remarkable error was committed in looking to the Child after the Birth, and before the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the preſent Diſeaſ. <hi>Of which we have ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove in the Chapter of the Cauſes after the Birth.</hi>

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> If the Diſeaſ cannot be imputed to any weak or diſeaſed Conſtitution of the Parents, or their manner of life, or the errors of their cuſtoms.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If no debility appeared preſently after the Birth.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If the Brothers and Siſters were free from the Diſeaſ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If any notorious errors were committed about the Child after the Birth.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>If any Diſeaſ went before which might occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion a ſuſpition that this followed it.</hi> If there be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of moſt or all of theſe Signs, they do ſufficiently
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:169706:131"/>
witneſs that this Diſeaſe muſt not be attributed to any Natural Infection, but to the future Errors and Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities. And thus much of the differences of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe in reſpect of the Cauſes.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Som differences happen to this Diſeaſ by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of other Diſeaſes, wherewith they are peradventure complicated; in which caſe, beſides the <hi>Diagnoſtical</hi> ſigns already reckoned, ſome other may be deſired as pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly proper to the complicated Diſeaſ. Nevertheleſs an accurat Deſcription of them cannot be here expected, becauſ for the moſt part they are the ſame which are eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where artributed to thoſe Diſeaſes by practical Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. But becauſ ſom Diſeaſes do more frequently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company this than others, we wil briefly look into their Signs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt therfore a</hi> Hydrocephalus <hi>or Dropſie in the Head being complicated with this Affect needeth ſomtimes no ſigns to make it known, but is ſufficiently, yea abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſt of it ſelf: namly, either by</hi> the exceeding mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of the Head, <hi>or</hi> by the water that is outwardly contained under the Pericranium <hi>(which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding we ſuppoſe doth very rarely happen) or</hi> by ſom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream opening and wideneſs of the ſeams in the Head, Water having gotten into them, and lifting up the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> ſo that a ſoft and wateriſh tumor is outwardly perceivable by the touch in the ſpaces between the Bones. <hi>Many times the</hi> Hydrocephalus <hi>is ſomwhat obſcure and requireth ſigns to diſcover it. Firſt,</hi> Therfore all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward ſenſes are more dull than otherwiſe they uſe to be in this effect. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The magnitude of the Head is ſomtimes greater than at other times. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> The <hi>Sutures,</hi> or ſeams in the accuſtomed places do gape more wide, and are cloſed again more ſlowly than they are wont to be. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Bone in the Forehead is
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:169706:132"/>
more outwardly ſticking out, and in the other Bones of the Head you may obſerve certain inequalities and bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings out of an unuſual bigneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The conjoyned evils of breeding Teeth are thus known. <hi>1.</hi> If the accuſtomed time of breeding Teeth be either approching, or now at hand; <hi>for from hence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth ſome ſuſpition of pain from thence proceeding. This time ordinarily begineth in the ſeventh month af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the birth, and continueth til the Child be a year and ſix months old, and longer, if the Teeth come ſlowly; which hapneth very commonly in this affect; and it endeth when the number of the Teeth is compleat. 2. Children to mitigat the raging pain do uſe</hi> to put their Fingers into their Mouths, <hi>according to that old ſaying,</hi> ubi dolor ibi Digitus. <hi>3.</hi> The Gums wax white on that ſide where the Tooth is to break out, and are ſomwhat hot in the touch. <hi>4.</hi> The Teeth that come forth ſometimes wax black or are looſ, or fal out by pieces. <hi>5.</hi> To theſe you may ad watchings, the looſneſs of the Belly, Feavers and Convulſions, <hi>which notwithſtanding are chanceable Symptoms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> An Aſthma is perceived by the very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of breathing, <hi>when it doth not proceed from the ſtretching and fulneſs of the loweſt Belly. But if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al there be a</hi> ſwelling <hi>or</hi> Impoſthum, &amp; that in either ſide of the Lungs, they can ſcarce endure to lie on the contrary ſide; <hi>but</hi> if it be on both ſides, then they deſire to lie er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect or with their Faces upwards. <hi>The ſame thing for the moſt part hapneth</hi> in an Inflamation, with a growing together of the Lungs with the Pleura, <hi>as alſo in a</hi> Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie, <hi>but</hi> then there are added, an acute Feaver, a Cough and ſpitting of Bloud, <hi>moreover in a Pluriſie</hi> a pricking pain in the Side. <hi>The</hi> Phtiſick <hi>is known</hi> by a diuturnal Cough, and a roundiſh and ſomtimes a purulent ſpittle
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:169706:132"/>
                  <hi>(although indeed Children do ſeldom ſpit out, becauſ that matter which the Cough fetches up into the Mouth they ſwallow by the oeſphagus) alſo</hi> by a putrid Feaver conjoyned, and by a ſudden Colliquation in the parts. An Aſcites <hi>is diſcovered</hi> by the unreaſonable bigneſs of the Abdomen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> A Hectick Feaver <hi>bewrayeth it ſelf</hi> by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual heat, being ſomwhat more vehement than that in a Quotidian Ague, <hi>eſpecially</hi> about the Arteries, and ſtil encreaſeth after the receiving of meat; <hi>alſo</hi> by the ſwift and ſpeedy conſumption of the parts: a putrid fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is known by the urin being at the begining cude, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards more concocted, then alſo from the extream high color of it. <hi>Moreovor,</hi> if it be an intermitting A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, it is diſcernable by the inequality of the heat, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts being at the begining extream cold, &amp; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards exceſſive hot; <hi>alſo</hi> from the fits either conſtant or erratical; <hi>again,</hi> by the contraction of the Pulſ upon the approach of the fit, afterwards unduly encreaſed. A continual Feaver is known by an intenſive and un-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting heat, <hi>alſo</hi> by thirſt, roughneſs of the Mouth, and the altered color of the Tongue, and the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Venerious Pox is ſuppoſed <hi>to meet in complication,</hi> if either of the Parents or the Nurſ were before infected; if any ulers appear in the Head, Mouth and Noſtrils; or if any eminent and cruſted Wheals break out, eſpecially ſuch as ordinary Medicins cannot ſubdue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if hard tumors grow conſpicuous, or knots defiling the Bones in the Fingers with rottenneſs, or any other parts; if unquietneſs and bitter pains in the night-time alarum the ſick; or if Buboes break out in the Groyn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly, The</hi> Scurvy <hi>complicated with this affect hath theſe ſigns: 1.</hi> They that labor under this affect do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently endure Purgations; but they who are only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:169706:133"/>
with the <hi>Rachites</hi> do eaſily tolerate the ſame. <hi>2.</hi> They are much offended with violent exerciſes, neither can they at all endure them. <hi>But although in this affect alone, ther be a kind of ſlothfulneſs and averſation from exerciſe, yet exerciſe doth not ſo manifeſtly, at leaſt not altogether ſo manifeſtly hurt them, as when the</hi> Scurvy <hi>is conjoyned with the</hi> Rachites. <hi>3.</hi> upon any concitated and vehement motion they draw not breath without much difficulty, they are vexed with diverſ pains run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning through their Joynts, and theſe they give warning of by their crying, the motion of the Pulſ is frequent and unequal, and ſomtimes they are troubled with a Falpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Heart, or threatned with a Lypothymie, which Affects ar for the moſt part ſoon mitigated, or alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether apeaſed by laying them down to the reſt. <hi>4.</hi> Tumors do very commonly appear in the Gums. <hi>5.</hi> The urin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the abſence of the accuſtomed Feaver is much more intenſ and encreaſed.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>The Strumatical Affect,</hi> if extreamly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated with the <hi>Rachites,</hi> is ſufficiently conſpicuous <hi>by Swellings obvious to the ſenſes;</hi> yea, where many knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Excreſcences do outwardly occur, it may be juſtly ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected that the like Tumors do lurk in the Bowels. But if the knots grow inwardly only, they are ſcarce diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable by any certain ſign; for that Rule which ſome have obſerved, namly, That thoſe who have ſhort Necks, low and narrow Forheads, with compreſſed Temples, and wide Cheek-bones, are ſubject to theſe ſtrumatical Tumors and Excreſcencies, is too uncertain and fallible; Others affirm, That Purging Medicines taken otherwiſe in a juſt proportion will ſcarce work with thoſe who are thus affected; but we anſwer from our own Experience That it is ſomtimes only, and not alwaies true. Thus much of the ſigns of the differences.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXIII. The Prognoſtical Signs in the Diſeaſ of the <hi>Rachites.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THis Diſeaſ in its <hi>kind is not mortal,</hi> yea ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is ſo light and gentle, as the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren affected therwith have been reſtored to health by the ſole benefit of Age, the Vital heat being encreaſed and ſummoned forth to the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal parts by the force of frequent Exerciſes. Yet it ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo vehemently prevaileth, that the iminent danger of life can ſcarce, yea ſomtimes cannot be prevented by the beſt and moſt prudent applications. Wherfore it is very neceſſary that a Phyſitian ſhould firſt diligently contemplat the Prognoſtical ſigns of a diſeaſ, that hemay be the better inſtructed to forſee the ſeveral events of it. But in general thoſe things which abet the Diſeaſ, that is, all ſuch things as war againſt Nature, require a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary conſideration, and as theſ are the ſtronger and they the weaker, ſo much the more grievous and pernitious is the Diſeaſ. But becauſ it is not obvious to every one to give an accurate Judgment of Particulars from this General Admonition, it will not be impertinent or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to inſert ſom particular and ſpecial Rules and Obſervations hitherto belonging.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>This Diſeaſ properly Natural, or that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vadeth before the birth, is the moſt dangerous, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, if ever, end in health.</hi> For it argueth a deprivation
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:169706:134"/>
of the Seminary principles, and by conſequence that the Spirits are very infirm; beſides it inſinuateth a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency in the cauſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The more early the invaſion is after the Birth, the more dangerous <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſ is: <hi>for the Spirits are ſo much the weaker. In like manner,</hi> The Elder Children, and ſuch as go up and down, are more eaſily cured then yong Infants that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not uſe their legs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A Diſeaſ improperly ſo called; <hi>nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that which in part dependeth upon the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inclination,</hi> is more dangerous than that Which is contracted by the meer error of the Nurſe or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This Diſeaſ proceeding from ſom other fore-going Affects, is more dangerous than that which is introduced by an erroneous Regiment of health; <hi>For it implyeth a precedent dejection of the Spirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly, Som have obſerved,</hi> That Infants who have had red Haird women to their Nurſes, have been moſt obnoxious to this Affect. <hi>Yet we indeed ſuſpect this rule of ſom fallability.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, Some affirm, <hi>That Girls are more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently infeſted with this Diſeaſ than Boys, and more eaſily cured.</hi> The truth is, we have not yet had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unſuſpected experience of this. Yet we grant that Girls are of a more cold and moiſt tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which holdeth the greateſt correſpondency with this Diſeaſ, and for that reaſon probable it is that the Female Sex may be affected with the ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cauſes, and for the ſame reaſon alſo be the ſooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, <hi>This Diſeaſ doth chiefly invade the Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles</hi>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:169706:134"/>
               <hi>of the Gentry, eſpecially, of thoſe who live at eaſ, and fare deliciouſly; then of the poorer ſort,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the manifold and various errors which neceſſity introduceth as wel in the diet of the Parents, as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of their Children; but it findeth the moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult acceſs unto thoſe <hi>who are priviledged from ſuch aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults by a mediocrity of fortune, and accuſtomed to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo ſome pains-taking and labor,</hi> and are not deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of neceſſary means to ſuſtain life and a healthful competency to prevent indiſpoſition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> By how much the more the firſt affected parts are extenuated, ſo much the more difficult <hi>caeteris paribus</hi> is the cure of the Diſeaſ.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, <hi>The greater the Head is, the longer and the harder is the Cure.</hi> When therfore the Bone of the Forehead ſticks much out forwards, it portendeth at leaſt a long continuance of the Diſeaſ; the ſame alſo do the other irregular ſtickings out of the other Bones of the Head.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, <hi>The weaker the Back-bone, the greater and more dangerous is the Affect.</hi> Wherfore they which are unwilling to ſit upright, much more they which are not able to ſit upright, but moſt of all they whoſe feeble Necks cannot underprop the burden of the Head, are in hazard of their lives. Moreover, by the <hi>Diuturnal</hi> weakneſs and bending of the Back-bone, Children become Crook-back'd, or ſome other waies incuruated, and the trunk of the Body is afterwards ſcarce reducible to its Native Figure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> Great Swellings in the Bones of the Wreſts and the ends of the Ribs preſage the continuance of the Diſeaſ. <hi>Moreover,</hi> The crookedneſs of the Shank-bone, Shoulder-bone, or the Bone in the Arm, prognoſticate no leſs. <hi>Again,</hi> The greater that the inflexion of the Joints
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:169706:135"/>
is, the more difficult and retarded will the reſtauration be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Twelfthly,</hi> They whoſe Thigh and Shank-bones are much encreaſed, rather according to latitude and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, then according to longitude, for the moſt part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com dwarfs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>13<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>.</hi> They who draw their Knees upwards and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly, ſuffer them to be extended, recover not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſom difficulty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>14<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>.</hi> When the Teeth wax black or fal out by pieces, there is ſom danger, and ſo much the more, the later they com again, <hi>that is,</hi> others in their room.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>15<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>.</hi> Al they who attain to the conſiſtence of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſ, eſcape the danger of it, being carefully lookt unto, unleſs perhaps ſom other Diſeaſ be conjoyned with it, or do accidentally com after, and diſturb the Patient with a higher encreaſ. In like manner the declination of the Symptoms doth aſſuredly promiſe a reſtitution of health.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>16<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>.</hi> If an <hi>Hydrocephalus</hi> be complicated with the <hi>Rachites</hi> it ever importeth great danger. But if it prevail far, as that the <hi>Sutures</hi> of the Brain pan do gape, and that ſom water gotten into the middle <hi>Spaces</hi> doth ſwell the <hi>Dura mater</hi> into a wateriſh and ſoft Tumor, it is mortal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>17<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>.</hi> A painful and laborious breeding of Teeth coms ſomtimes accompanied with moſt vehement Symptoms, and even threatneth death. But commonly it is violent and ceaſeth in a ſhort time; <hi>however,</hi> ſo long as it is conjoyned, it much accelerates the motion of the Diſeaſ. <hi>But the Dog-Teeth com forth with more vexation, than the reſt and portend more danger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>18<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. <hi>An</hi> Aſthma <hi>(especially the</hi> Orthopny, <hi>when the Patient cannot draw breath, but with an erected</hi>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:169706:135"/>
               <hi>neck, and that difficulty of breathing when he cannot ly on either ſide) is very dangerous.</hi> For that prompteth to a ſuſpition of ſom Tumor, Impoſthum, Pleuriſie, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation of the Lungs, or ſom growing too of the Lungs with the Pleura, all which affects want not their danger.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>19<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>.</hi> If the <hi>Ptiſick</hi> be complicated with this Affect, it is for the moſt part mortal, especially if one and the ſame ulcer of the Lungs continu above forty days.</p>
            <p n="20">
               <hi>20.</hi> We affirm that if this Diſeaſ be of any long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance it eaſily changeth into the Ptyſick, or a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or at leaſt commonly brings a Conſumption to the deſtruction of the Sick, unleſs ſom other affect per adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or grievous ſymptom do intervene, and prevent the Conſumption by haſtning death; as a Convulſion, the loud Cough, the ſwelling of the Lungs, (vulgarly called, <hi>THE RISING OF THE LIGHTS)</hi> a continual Feaver, a Pleuriſie, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the next place,</hi> We aſſert, That if a Dropſy of the Lungs, or an <hi>Aſcites</hi> be complicated with the <hi>Rachites,</hi> it portends a desperate and deplorable condition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> An Hectick, ſlow, putrid, and eſpecially a continual Feaver, conſuming the firſt affected parts doth vehemently haſten the motion of this Diſeaſ, and render it the more dangerous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alſo,</hi> If the Venereous Pox be conſociated with the <hi>Rachites,</hi> b e it hereditary or contracted by infection, it is almoſt uncapable of remedy.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scurvy</hi> likewiſe conjoyned doth very much retard the cure, thoug h leſs than the Pox.</p>
            <p>In like manner <hi>Strumatical tumors either internal or external do not very much ſuspend the hopes of cure, though otherwiſe</hi> of themſelves they are not eaſily <hi>ſubdued in this tender age.</hi> For the external
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:169706:136"/>
parts are exulcerated, or inflamed with inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table pain, and do vehemently irritate Nature, and waſt the Spirits, but the internal much more, eſpecially, if they invade the more noble parts, or bring moleſtation to the adjacent members with their weight and bulk.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moreover,</hi> Whoſoever are not perfectly cured before the firſt five years of their age be spun out out, they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for the moſt part live miſerable and ſickly, and being either Aſtematical or Cachectical or P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yſical they dy before they arrive to the conſiſtence of their age, or elſe they grow deformed, crooked, and dwarfiſh.</p>
            <p>If Scabs, wheals, pimples, or the itch com after this Affect, it doth hopefully expedite the cure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> They which eaſily endure any kind of agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Body, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> are cured without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty.</p>
            <p>Thus at length we have finiſhed the Hiſtory of the three kinds of Signs, according to the beſt faith of our obſervations hitherto. In the next place we ſhal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Method of practice, which comprehendeth the prevention and cure of this Diſeaſ.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXV. The Method to practice and Indications in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Method to practice is divided into the <hi>Therapeutical</hi> and the <hi>Prophylactical</hi> part, or <hi>the Curative and the Preſervative.</hi> We ſhall diſcourſ of the former in this Chapter, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though perhaps we ſhal here alſo propound ſom things which are common both to the <hi>Prophylactical</hi> part, and the <hi>Eugieihal.</hi> But the <hi>Prophylactical</hi> in particular and uncommunicated we reſerve for the cloſe of this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate.</p>
            <p>The Curative part is uſually called the <hi>Meth od</hi> of <hi>Cure,</hi> wherof, as of every other art, there are two general inſtruments, namly, <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Experience,</hi> the uniting wherof comprehendeth the whol skil of the Artiſt. Now by experience we underſtand <hi>not only the Hiſtory of one or more Diſeaſes, and the ſucceſs of Medicines, but alſo the obſervation;</hi> that is, <hi>the application of the Hiſtories unto thoſe things, which reaſon dictates in the ſame af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and that by way of comprobation or diſallowance.</hi> In like manner, by reaſon we mean <hi>every operation of the mind,</hi> ſo as we do not only <hi>comprehend the third;</hi> namly, <hi>ratiocination either demonſtrative, or probable and Analogal,</hi> but alſo <hi>the firſt and ſecond,</hi> that is, <hi>a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple apprehenſion, comprehenſion and diviſion.</hi> For this
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:169706:137"/>
part of Medicine includeth or rather preſuppoſeth the <hi>Phyſiology, Patholog y and Semeiotical</hi> part, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly require a manifold exerciſe of every operation of the underſtanding. Again, no man can underſtand any propoſition, who doth not firſt apprehend the ſimple terms therof, nor any Syllogiſm, who is ignorant of the Propoſitions of which it conſiſteth; ſo that it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that every operation of the mind doth meet with an employment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Indication,</hi> That noble inſtrument of the Method of Cure (by the uſe wherof the Dogmatical Phyſitians do principally glory to diſcriminate their Sect from the Empericks) doth likewiſe vindicate a ſtation among the parts of reaſon. But becauſe ſom things both diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and obſcure do occur concerning this inſtrument which have not received an unfolding and ful illuſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from the <hi>Neotericks</hi> themſelvs, we judg it expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent here briefly to unvail them by an examination. We wil enquire therfore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> What is Indication?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Unto which operation of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it relateth?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Into what kinds and differences it is diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted?</p>
            <p>As for the firſt, although perhaps many ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this word may be found among Authors, yet that is the beſt and moſt proper which is delivered by <hi>Galen,</hi> in his book <hi>de Method. Meden. Indication</hi> (ſaith he) is an inſinuation or declaration of the conſequence, that is of ſomthing to be don. In this ſenſ <hi>Indication</hi> may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined and deſcribed to be an objective action of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicant</hi> relatively conſidered, which repreſenteth to the underſtanding the thing <hi>Indicated,</hi> that is, what may be helpful what hurtful, and by conſequence what muſt be
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:169706:137"/>
elected and applied, what forſaken and avoided, that this Deſcription or Definition may be the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, let us further examin what is here ſignified by the <hi>Indicant?</hi> what by the thing indicated? what the action of the <hi>Indicant</hi> is? of what uſe diſtinction is of the thing indicated into helpful or hurtful, into that which muſt be choſen, and that which muſt be refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed?</p>
            <p>Firſt, Although thoſe terms <hi>Indication, Indicant, Indicatum,</hi> or the thing Indicated may peradventure be extended to other Arts and Sciences, yet becauſ it hath hitherto been only apropriated by the Induſtry of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians (eſpecially of <hi>Galen)</hi> to the Method of Practice, their definitions which we ſhall here declare, ſhall have reſpect only to this Method, all other uſe of them being pretermitted.</p>
            <p>The General Definition therfore of the <hi>Indicant</hi> muſt be derived from the moſt general Nature which doth indicate in our Art. The <hi>Indicant</hi> therfore may be defined in general to be a ſtate of the Body as it is fluxible or movable, or rather, as it is actually influx or motion, relatively conſidered, namely, as it intimateth what is to be done in that particular.</p>
            <p>Firſt, We affirm that the <hi>Indicant</hi> doth perpetually imply ſome ſtate or condition of the Body; wherfore becauſ that which is without the Body, and doth not yet affect it, is no ſtate or condition of the Body, it can ſcarce rightly be ſaid to indicate. The external cauſ therfore, which doth not yet affect the Body, is not the <hi>Indicant,</hi> although the averſion of it may poſſibly be the thing indicated. Secondly, the ſtate of the Body as it is frail, or movable, or rather as it is actually in motion, is required to the Eſſence of the <hi>Indicant.</hi> For as <hi>Galen</hi> moſt luculently proveth to <hi>Thraſyb.</hi> If our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:169706:138"/>
were immutable and perpetual, there were no need of Medicine, but becauſ the heat doth continually feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the moiſture, and becauſ health it ſelf in the moſt perfect ſtate is frail and fluxible, yea actually fluitant, and in ſome meaſure is already flowed away, manifeſt it is that the Phyſitians Art and the Practical Duty of the Phyſitian are both exceeding requiſite. For if the ſtate of the Body and the alteration therof be only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered abſolutely, a bare and naked ſpeculation only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulteth from thence: but if it be conſidered in order to that which is to be done wherby the Phyſitian may rightly execute his duty concerning that ſtate, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it meriteth the denomination of a Practical Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and is inveſted with the nature of an <hi>Indicant.</hi> For ſuch a ſtate doth indicate, as it is frail and in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that care muſt be every way had of the health, and that that care muſt be exerciſed and practiſed with all diligence and circumſpection. And conſequently this very general <hi>Indicant</hi> doth point out, that which the general ſcope of the Phyſitians ſought after, but it muſt not be expected that the conſideration of the moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Indicant</hi> can repreſent any other thing than a moſt general action correſpondant to the general ſcope. For if the Phyſitian deſireth a higher proſecution of the particular ſcope, he ought to deſcend to more particular <hi>Indicants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The thing Indicated is a Medical Action required on the part of the <hi>Indicant.</hi> For the <hi>Indicant</hi> primarily and formally denoteth the action, but ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily and by conſequence the inſtrument wherwith the action is perfected. Therfore by way of an appendix let us ad to the propoſed Definition, that ſecondarily, by conſequence, and in a concrete acception, it inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Inſtrument wherwith that action is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:169706:138"/>
Firſt, We ſay, that the thing indicated is an action For the Phyſitian uſeth Indication to that end, that from thence he may collect what is to be done: you will ſay perhaps, that when the criſis is at hand or legitimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceedeth, the thing indicated is an abſtinence from, or a ſuſpenſion of the action, and not the action it ſelf.</p>
            <p>We anſwer, That this abſtinence in that very regard that it is enjoyned adviſedly and according to art, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently contained under ſome kind of notion of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Action; and the ſame is to be ſaid of any kind of prohibition of any action in our Art.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We ſay that the thing indicated is a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Action, that is directing the Action to health. For the end of Medicine is health, and therfore that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which doth aim at health is rightly termed a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Action.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We ſay, That the thing Indicated is an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction requiſite and importing at leaſt in reſpect of the <hi>Indicant.</hi> For every indicated action ought not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to be reduced to Practice, neither can it be ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſaid to be requiſite, but only in reference to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicant: wherfore it muſt be expoſed to a further exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination before the exerciſe of it can be reſolved on; and if neither the Spirits do diſſwade, nor no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra-Indicant doth more potently reſiſt, then it is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply requiſite, and muſt be put in practice in its due time, with all poſſible convenience. And herupon the thing indicated is rightly diſtinguiſhed into profitable and unprofitable. The thing indicated becomes unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble either by defect of Medical matter, wherwith it ſhould be accompliſhed, or by the preſence of a ſtronger Prohibent, or contra-Indicant.</p>
            <p>Again, A thing indicated and profitable is rightly
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:169706:139"/>
ſubdivided into an <hi>Indicate, Circumſtantiate,</hi> and <hi>non-Circumſtantiate.</hi> The firſt by which is meant an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on rightly cloathed with circumſtances muſt be proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted without any delay. The ſecond muſt be deferred until it have perfectly acquired due circumſtances. We ſay fourthly, That a thing indicated in a concrete and ſecondary ſenſ doth alſo include the Inſtrument, wherby the Indicated Action is perfected. As for example, the ſtate of health doth primarily and formally indicate an act of conſervation, but ſecondarily and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence it doth withal indicate the Inſtrument, wherby we conſerve it. This paſſage of an Indication from the Action to the Inſtrument doth not ſeem to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſole vertue of the Indicant, but in part alſo upon ſome general certain and commonly received principles, as like things are conſerved by the like, things contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry are cured by their contraries, and therfore we indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly ſaid that ſuch an Inſtrument is the Indication or thing Indicated in a Secondary ſenſ, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence inferred, and becauſ it includeth the Action to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Iſtrument, we termed it ſo likewiſe in a concrete ſignification.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Seing that the Practical duty of a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath great affinity with the Indicated action; we ſhall here conſider wherin they unite in ſome agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and wherin they differ among themſelves. The general Duty of a Phyſitian is to attain (as much as in him lies) the end of his Art, namely Health. And that ſame obtaining of Health is in a manner the moſt general Indicated Action, yet this is diſtinguiſhed from the general Duty of a Phyſitian, becauſ the Purchaſe, and reſtauration of Health is not alwaies attainable. Therfore although the obtaining of Health be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Indicated; yet when that is impoſſible, the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:169706:139"/>
is diſobliged, ſeing that no man is bound to impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities, and ſo conſequently, it is no part of his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. In like manner an Indicated Action is ſomtimes unprofitable for the reaſons before alledged, in which caſe it appertaineth not to the Duty of the Phyſitian. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, An Indicated action, though when it is profitable it muſt be performed in its place, yet ſo long as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues an apparel'd and deveſted of due circumſtances, it preſſeth not the Duty of a Phyſitian. For it is the part of a Phyſitian not only to preſcribe things profitable in the Species, but they muſt be ſuch, regard being had to time, order, and other conditions of a juſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular adminiſtration. Finally a profitable Indicated Action being robbed in all its due circumſtances doth truly exact the duty of a Phyſitian. For a Phyſitian is obliged to execute ſuch actions, and only ſuch, at leaſt when they are conſpicuous.</p>
            <p>Beſides; The ſcope and intentions of the Phyſitian having a diverſe reſpect to the Indicated Actions and the Duties of the Phyſitian, and holding ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with each of them, we ſhall likewiſe here conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in what reſpect this falleth out. But in the very entrance into this Diſcourſ theſe ſcopes ſeem ſomtimes to be properly diſtinguiſhable into little notions or forms of enquiry after every Duty of a Phyſitian, and the things themſelves to be enquired after. The forms of enquiry are nothing elſe but apt Queſtions or Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogations, which ſubdivide every Duty of a Phyſitian into ſo many parts, as it containeth to be diſtinctly ſif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and examined. <hi>Argenterius</hi> reckons up nine Forms of this kind: Firſt, Whether? Secondly, What? Thirdly, With what matter? Fourthly, How much? Fifthly? Of what kind? Sixthly, After what manner? Seventhly, When? Eighthly, Where? Ninthly, In
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:169706:140"/>
what order a thing muſt be done? Others contract theſe to fewer Heads, but for further ſatisfaction the underſtanding Reader may conſult with the Books. The real Scopes or things themſelves to be enquired are thoſe very parts, into which each Duty of a Phyſitian may be aptly diſtinguiſhed. They are therfore ſo many in number as there are found parts in that duty to be examined. Theſe Scopes thus found out differ not really, but only in reaſon from thoſe that are yet to be found out, namely in reſpect of the diverſe relation to the intellect ſeeking, and actually underſtanding. From hence it appeareth what affinity there is between theſe Scopes and the Duty of a Phyſitian, and alſo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated actions. For the notional Scopes or forms of Scopes, and the things themſelves to be enquired after under thoſe forms do both aim at the ſame mark, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the diſtinct invention of all the parts of a Phyſitians Duty. But the things to be ſought out are the parts themſelves of the Duty aptly ſeparated and disjoyned from one another the better to facilitate the invention and examination.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Thoſe parts of this Duty, in as much as they are found out by the force of Indication, are the very indicated Actions; ſo that the Scopes invented by the Indication, and the Indicated Actions do really ſignifie the ſame things. We ſay really, becauſ the Scopes even when found out differ in reaſon from them as they are Scopes, ſeing that beſides the Indicated Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they ſeem to note together an intention of proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the ſame Actions, as the Scopes not yet found out do intimate an intention of enquiring into them. Thus much of Indicates or things Indicated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The action of an <hi>Indicant</hi> is <hi>Objective</hi> and
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:169706:140"/>
               <hi>Indicant,</hi> as an Object beſides it ſelf, doth in ſom ſort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate another thing to the underſtanding. <hi>Perhaps ſom may wonder,</hi> how an Object can repreſent any other thing beſides it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We anſwer,</hi> Such is the Nature of relatives, that (as ſuch) they cannot be conceived without an implicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their correlatives. For one relative in his proper conſideration doth at leaſt obliquely involve the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of another, and by that means it eaſily uſhereth the underſtanding to the knowledg of the other.</p>
            <p>Som may reply, <hi>If the force of the</hi> Indication <hi>be built upon the meer relation of the</hi> Indicant <hi>to the</hi> Indicatum, <hi>How coms it to paſs that the uſe therof is reſtrained ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Art of Medicine?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To this we anſwer,</hi> We deny not, but this inſtrument may be extended to other Arts and Sciences, as we have before inſinuated. For in moral Philoſophy it is lawful to ſay, that Vertu doth Indicate the protection of her ſelf, and Vice the ſuppreſſion of it ſelf. But neither doth this kind of relation conſiſt only between the States of things, and the Actions therunto belonging, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the terms meerly ſpeculative; as twice two are four, a man is not a horſe. But here we conſider the <hi>Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and the efficacy of the <hi>Indicant</hi> only in order to the Method of Phyſick, ſo as it wil not be here needful to extend the uſe of this inſtrument further, neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed did <hi>Galen,</hi> becauſe it would contribute little to the ſcope therof. Yet we affirm, that every relation is not a ſufficient <hi>baſis</hi> of an <hi>Indication,</hi> but it muſt be ſuch, as hath either an evident conformity and agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Indicant</hi> and <hi>Indicatum,</hi> wherby they may be fitly marſhalled into a propoſition of undoubted truth; or a diſparity and repugnance of them among themſelvs
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:169706:141"/>
that ſo they may aptly be divided from one another; that is, they may be diſpoſed into a negative propoſition e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually certain. Now becauſe the propoſitions elected by this indication are certain and evident, not needing any higher proof: from thence it is manifeſt that every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that is Maſter of it ſelf, not clouded with a vail of prejudice, nor wittingly enſnared with ſceptical Sophiſms and fallacies, muſt neceſſarily pay an aſſent unto them ſo ſoon as he underſtandeth the terms. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the Scepticks themſelvs, though in their diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they wil lie in wait to traverſe any verity, how mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ſoever it be, and buſy themſelvs to equal the moſt certain principles with things extreamly doubtful, yet in performing the neceſſaries of life, ſeing that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve hunger by food, hoard up mony, avoyd ſtripes, and do theſe and the like things conſtantly and without any diſtemper of mind, they plainly diſcover that they are led by ſom bad diſpoſition of mind, or governed by a deſire of glory, or tickled w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> a hope of victory in the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, rather that they doubt really of the truth of ſuch Propoſitions. In the interim, it muſt be obſerved, that the very Indication is fallible and deceitful, where the abſolute nature of the <hi>Indicant</hi> or the <hi>Indicatum</hi> hath not been exactly underſtood before. For in this art of Indications, we do not preſuppoſe only that a Phyſitian ſhould always have learned before, and duly known what al thoſe things are, which we cal according to Nature, as alſo in what the Eſſence of a Diſeaſ, and all the parts therof conſiſt, and to have an exact knowledg of all the cauſes of an Affect. Yea, it is neceſſary that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand all Medical actions, and upon occaſion be able to render a ready account what alteration is, what heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what cooling, &amp;c. what evacuation, purgation, and the ſection of a vein, &amp;c. what conſervation, and the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:169706:141"/>
like. For the Indication doth not make manifeſt the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute nature either of the <hi>Indicant</hi> or the <hi>Indicatum;</hi> but preſuppoſing this as already known, it repreſenteth only a mutual relation; namly, either a ſtrict connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and conformity which they retain among themſelvs, or a diſparity and oppoſition, wherby they may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into an undoubted propoſition: but the certainty of the indicated propoſition cannot exceed the certainty of the knowledg of the Indicant. Therfore if at any time we ſcruple the certain knowledg of the Nature of the Indicant, it is not ſafe to truſt to the Indication a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, til it ſhal better be confirmed by ſom other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or experience. But this doubting muſt not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the Nature of the Indication, but to the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Indicant.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it muſt be conſidered that the relation of the Indicant in the Method of practice, doth demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate beſides the evidence ſomwhat of duty in reſpect of the Indicated action, and that the propoſitions formed from the Indication do either explicitly, or at leaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly inſinuate that duty. As in this Propoſition, a Diſeaſ doth Indicate the ablation of it ſelf, the ablation is decreed and reſolved upon, as a requiſit action on the part of the Indicant, that is a Diſeaſ: as if one ſhould ſay, a Diſeaſ requireth or importuneth the removal of it ſelf. Yet this duty of the action is more frequently and indeed much more elegantly expreſſed by the Participle in <hi>dus,</hi> as a Diſeaſ is to be taken away: which Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the fulneſs of its ſignification hath a manifeſt coincidence with the former.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There remaineth ſtil an objection to be anſwered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the action of the Indicant; and this it is,</hi> If the <hi>Indication</hi> be the very action of the <hi>Indicant,</hi> how can it be called an operation of the underſtanding? For all
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:169706:142"/>
writers refer the <hi>Indication</hi> to ſom generation of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We anſwer,</hi> The Indication is indeed an action of the Indicant, but yet an objective action, and that it is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to the intellective faculty, and abideth in it as in its ſubject: Moreover, that the underſtanding a power, both actuated, and as it were informed by its ſubject. Wherfore although the action of Indication be obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively attributed to the Indicant, yet ſubjectively it is aſcribed to the Soul, and eſpecially to the intellective part therof, which is as it were the act and form of it. And from hence it wil be moſt eaſy to reconcile <hi>Galen</hi> with himſelf, who ſomtimes defineth Indication to be an <hi>Emphaſis,</hi> ſomtimes a <hi>Catalepſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, It muſt be examined whether that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of an Indicated action, into an action helpful and hurtful may tend. For ſom may urge, that <hi>Galen</hi> doth perpetually affirm, that one <hi>Indicatum</hi> only can be inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated from one Indicant; and that in his <hi>Method. Med.</hi> he doth affirm, <hi>That they vainly attempt the Method of cure, who are ignorant that one thing is Indicated from one Indicant,</hi> and that all who have written of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter do ſeem to atteſt the ſame thing,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We anſwer,</hi> That <hi>Galen</hi> muſt be underſtood of the three diſtinct<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> kinds of Indicants, which muſt by no means be confounded, nor their Indicates, that is, the things indicated by them. For that which a Diſeaſ doth properly Indicate, muſt not be attributed to the cauſes or the Spirits: In like manner that which the cauſes In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate muſt not be applyed to the Spirits or the Diſeaſ it ſelf. Finally, that which the Spirits Indicate muſt nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be aſcribed to the Diſeaſ nor the cauſes. For in this reſpect one Indicate anſwereth to one Indicant, and he that obſerves not this, muſt unavoydably confound all
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:169706:142"/>
things, and in the employments of art makes an unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesful uſe of this inſtrument, according to the judgment of <hi>Galen.</hi> But it muſt be conſidered, that in each of theſe kinds, the <hi>Indicatum</hi> may be divided into two parts, one wherof is an advantageous action, and to be proſecuted; the other is noxious and to be avoyded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet each of them belongeth to one and the ſame kind amongſt the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid three, and is as it were a middle part of the whole Indicate: For the Spirits direct to an election of ſuch things as may cheriſh and protect them, and to an avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſuch things as may in a further degree empair them: and both theſe actions concur to advance and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain the compleat and final conſervation of them. In like manner, both in cure and reſtauration, and alſo in caution and prevention, there is found an action as well to be embraced, as abandoned; yet whether of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth the bounds of its kind, ſo that no confuſion can from thence be feared. For whilſt we cure, we make choice of thoſe things that wil demoliſh the Diſeaſ, and we deliver the application of ſuch things as wil augment it. In like manner, when we preſerve, we take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the cauſes, and withal we ſhun the uſe of thoſ things that may conſpire either the continuation, or future breeding of them. And for this Reaſon in the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we have preſented above of an Indication, we diſtinguiſhed the action indicated into that which ought to be proſecuted, and that which ought to be waved: which very thing alſo we were about to do, in the enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of the particular Indications to this Diſeaſ.</p>
            <p>It is now time for us to proceed to the ſecond enquiry propounded at the beginning, namely, Unto which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the Intellective faculty the Indication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth. We ſay, firſt, That the Indication doth in ſom ſort include the ſimple apprehenſion of each term, both
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:169706:143"/>
of the Indicant and the Indicate. For he can never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand a Propoſition who is ignorant of the Terms therof. Yet this knowledg is only preparatory and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed in the art of Indications, as we have already noted. We affirm ſecondly, That compoſition and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion is an explicit operation of the Intellective faculty in the perception of an Indication. For the Indicant by force of his relation doth repreſent the Indicate to be aptly continued together into a relative propoſition. Now that a Propoſition thus conſtituted may in its own nature be ſo manifeſt and evident, that no man can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably doubt of the truth therof, or need any cleerer proof, is expreſly taught by <hi>Galen</hi>—<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and again in another place—<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Here ſom calumniate <hi>Galen,</hi> as if he had deviſed an art ſeparated from all experience, and quarrelling with Reaſon; but becauſe <hi>Galen</hi> intended nothing elſe, than that Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions framed by Indication are of ſelf credit, and need not any comprobation from Reaſon or Experience, theſ Criticks may perceiv their own raſhneſs and retract the ſcandal. <hi>Senertus</hi> indeed objecteth, that the Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot belong to the ſecond operation of the mind, becauſe the Indicate is neither affirmed nor denied of the Indicant. But that learned man was herein miſtaken. For although peradventure that the Indicate be neither affirmed nor denied of the Indicant directly, and by the bare Verb Subſtantive or Copulative <hi>(eſt.)</hi> Yet indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and obliquely it is manifeſtly predicated of the ſame, and after the ſame manner as it uſeth to be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Propoſitions. As for example, A ſound State is the Indicant of its own conſervation; a ſickly conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the Indicant of ſom remedy, &amp;c. And if any man wil expreſs the Indicate with his relation to the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:169706:143"/>
by the participle in <hi>dus,</hi> than the Predication will be direct. As a ſound State is to be preſerved; a diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed State is to be cured, a Diſeaſ muſt be removed, &amp;c. If the Learned <hi>Senertus</hi> can deny theſe to be Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he may with the like facility deny that an Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on belongeth to this Operation of the Underſtanding; but if he muſt needs confeſs that, there is no room left for the denial of this. Now we have ſaid that the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation doth belong to the ſecond Operation of the Mind, becauſ the Underſtanding, in reference to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of time, doth withal comprehend the mutual relation between the Indicant and the Indicate, and thereupon frameth a Propoſition, which formation and contexture of the Propoſition is the very Indication; and explicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſecond Operation of the Underſtanding. Now that the Underſtanding doth together at one time compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Indicant and the Indicate in the Indication, is elegantly expreſſed by <hi>Galen</hi> in a decompounded word which he uſeth in the definition therof, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: alſo in another definition, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>We ſay Thirdly, That Indication <hi>may likewiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly be referred to the third operation of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;</hi> Becauſ in the order of Nature the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſeemeth firſt to perceive the evident relation of the Indicant to the Indicate before it can conclude of the certainty of the Propoſition from thence reſulting. Although in the order of time the Mind (as hath been ſaid) comprehendeth them together; neither is it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to form an explicit Syllogiſm, for the truth is, The Underſtanding can comprehend thoſe things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at one time, which by the Inſtitution of Nature are termed Succeſſive, as the Sun and Light, Fire and Heat, &amp;c. But in regard that this ſimultaneous comprehenſion
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:169706:144"/>
of an Indication doth include a certain dependance of the knowledg of the Indicate from the perceived relation of the Indicant, it ſuppoſeth alſo that the ſaid relation is ſooner perceived at leaſt in the order of Nature, and that the Indicate is later underſtood and by an implicit brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in, for a kind of tranſition, in reſpect of the order of Nature doth ſeem to be here implied from the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Indicant, as the <hi>Medius terminus,</hi> to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition conſtituted of the Indicant and the Indicate as to the concluſion; and this may be called an implicit reaſoning.</p>
            <p>We ſay Fourthly, <hi>That by circumlocution and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of ſpeech, an</hi> Indication <hi>may be reduced to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit reaſoning or ſyllogiſm, or rather, that the ſame thing which we purſue &amp; argue at by Indication is to be found out and proved by way of Syllogiſm.</hi> For the Reaſon of the evidance of an Indicated Propoſition may explicitly be applied, as the <hi>Medius terminus,</hi> to infer that propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. In the interim a Syllogiſm ſo pieced together will be either abſolutly frivolous and childiſh, or at the beſt only explicatory. As if any one who would prove that a Diſeaſ were to be removed, ſhould thus proceed: <hi>That which is contrary to Nature is to be removed; A Diſeaſ is contrary to Nature, therfore a Diſeaſ is to be removed.</hi> The <hi>Medius terminus (that is againſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)</hi> is not the reaſon of the Relation of a Diſeaſ to the Ablation therof, but it is only an Expoſition of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Nature of a Diſeaſ. For whoſoever underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth what a Diſeaſ is, doth at the ſame inſtant preſently conceive ſomthing not natural. And therfore ſuch a ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſm is only expoſitory. Yet we do not ſuppoſe it to be alwaies unprofitable, becauſ it may ſomtimes be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the conviction of a ſtubborn, or the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation an ignorant Diſtemper. Hither alſo we may
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:169706:144"/>
refer the tranſlation of an Indication from the Action to the Inſtruments by vertue of general Rules: Likes are preſerved by their likes, Contraries cured by their contraries.</p>
            <p>We ſay Fifthly, <hi>That a Collation of the Indications a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelvs, wherby we may guide our choice by the conſent and diſſent of the Indicants to what ſimply and abſolutly ought to be done, doth neceſſarily involve the third Operation of the Underſtanding.</hi> For the limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any Indication ſuppoſeth a midle term extraneous to that Indication, which being firſt underſtood, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation is inferred as a concluſion. For he that findeth out an external for a middle term (thereby to aſſert the verity of any propoſition) doubtleſs he manifeſtly argues and diſputes. Seing therfore that beſides the Indicant and the Indicate a third term, and the affirmation or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation therof is required to the limitation of an Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, evident it is that the third Operation of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is requiſit to the Invention therof. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although ſimple Indications may ſubminiſter the firſt rudiments of Method to Practice, yet to the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and perfection of diſputing the Art muſt likewiſe be joyned with it.</p>
            <p>We affirm Sixthly, <hi>That the election of the Phyſical Matter in particular, and the apt and prudent admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration therof, doth not only imploy every Operation of the Underſtanding, but that it alſo requireth experience;</hi> for without this, who can ſufficiently underſtand to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter a doſe of <hi>Scamony</hi> or of any other purging Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament, or know what humors ſuch and ſuch a Plant draweth away by a peculiar propriety? Again, in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines alterant there may perhaps lurk ſom hidden qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which may be hurtful to the Patient, and this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out experience cannot be diſcerned. We conclude ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

(the proper force and uſe of Indications being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued) that to a compleat method of Medicine all the dictates of Reaſon, and the contributions of Experience are pre-required.</p>
            <p>We now proceed to the Third Title propounded at firſt, namly, Into what kinds and differences Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is diſtributed. Som differences may eaſily be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by what hath already been ſpoken, which therfore we ſhal here omit. Now here we diſtinguiſh Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into <hi>general, ſucceeding,</hi> and <hi>ſpecifical.</hi> The general is derived from the general Indicant, the ſucceeding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the intermediat kinds of Indicants, and the ſpecifical from the loweſt Species of them. We have already no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the general Indicant is the very ſtate of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy conſidered in general, as it is frail and in motion; this ſtate indicateth that health muſt be intended, which is the moſt general phyſical action, and the moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Indicate; yet this action is in ſom ſort concrete, and equally includeth two general actions in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract, namly Conſervation and Correction. For the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſtate aforeſaid is alſo concrete, and comprehendeth two like Conſiderations in the abſtract, namly, one of the parts yet qualified according to the preſcript of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which require a pure Conſervation: The ſecond of the parts ſomwhat degenerated from their integrity, which in like manner require a pure correction. Theſe two actions are perpetually conjoyned in every work of Art. For he that conſerveth, withal correcteth, that is, he rectifieth ſom irregularities; and he which correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, hath at the ſame time conſervation for the object of his Undertakings. The complication of theſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is ſo ſubtil, that it ſeemeth to have poſed that moſt acute Phyſitian <hi>Argenterius,</hi> who in his Book <hi>Off. Med<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> affirmeth Conſervation to be that very Correction,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:169706:146"/>
which is exerciſed in the art of maintaining health. But his Error is twofold. Firſt, becauſe he ſuppoſeth Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Conſervation in <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to be one and the ſame action, when indeed they are two diſtinct actions, however they are complicated in the Exerciſes of Art. For they are indicated (as we ſaid before) from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Conſiderations of the Indicant, and Conſervation hath reſpect to thoſe things which are according to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but Correction reflecteth upon preter-natural faultineſs. Moreover, They are perfected by inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments formally diſtinct, yea oppoſit: For Correction even in the very art of defending health, is accompliſht by Contraries, but Conſervation by Homogeneals; as in this Art we help Emptineſs by taking Nouriſhment, contrary indeed to the Emptineſs, but homogeneal to the Parts which are to be nouriſhed: Therfore although theſe Actions be complicated in the Execution, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are formally diſtinct, and ought diſtinctly to be entertain'd by the Underſtanding. The Second Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of <hi>Argenterius</hi> is, becauſe he granteth the correction of Errors only to be the General Action of al Medicin, when as Conſervation is equally univerſal and alike ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in al the works of Art.</p>
            <p>No man doubteth but we conſerve in the <hi>Hygienal</hi> part, and that we correct. Alſo <hi>Galen</hi> demonſtrats in his Book, whether the matters of preſerving health be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to a Phyſitian. You will ſay, That <hi>Galen</hi> in that place doth prove every Medicinal Action to be correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that conſervation is comprehended under the latitude of correction. But <hi>Galen</hi> muſt not be ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as if he intended correction to be a kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, ſeing that (as we have ſhewed before) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and correction even in this art of preſerving health are actions formally different and differently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed:
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:169706:147"/>
for <hi>Galen</hi>'s meaning is, that every Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal action when it is actually adminiſtred, doth imply and comprehend correction, and in that reſpect may be called Correction, and ſo by conſequence Correction will be the general Action of all Medicine; yet <hi>Galen</hi> confeſſeth Conſervation to be equally general. For what hinders but there may be two general abſtracted Actions in Phyſick? That doth not deſtroy, if any man have ſuch conceptions, the unity of the Art, it rather indeed confirms it. For the unity of an Art conſiſteth in ſome community, which may be attributed to all the parts therof; and this union is to be eſteemed ſo much the more firm, as all the parts of art are reciprocally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned among themſelvs by more communities. If ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there are two general Actions, and thoſe common to all the parts of Medicine, ſo much the more firmly will thoſe parts conſpire the advancement of the Art. Wherfore he contradicts not <hi>Galen,</hi> that affirms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation alſo to be a general Action of all Medicine; ſeing that the ſcope of <hi>Galen</hi> was only to ſhew the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Medical art by the community of that general Action, namely Correction; now he might as eaſily have ſhewed it, if the nature of the thing had required it, by the community of Conſervation. For in the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gienal part of the moſt noble circumſtance is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the whol concrete action, and therupon the whol action is denominated from the more principal part, and the Art it ſelf an Art conſervative. Although otherwiſe (as hath been ſaid) it alſo includes Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But in the <hi>Prophylactical</hi> part the principal ſcope of the Medical Action is preſervation, namely the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the cauſ of the imminent Diſeaſ: yet this is ſo performed, and by ſuch means which the preſent ſpirits can allow, but in no wiſe by ſuch things as may
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:169706:147"/>
deſtroy them. And therfore alſo in the <hi>Prophylactical</hi> part regard is had to the Spirits, and their conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is Indicated.</p>
            <p>Now after the ſame manner the whole concrete <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> (although as hath been ſaid, it alſo includeth Conſervation) is called Preſervation and Precaution from the more Noble part. Finally, In the <hi>Therapeutical</hi> part, although in like manner the whol concrete <hi>action</hi> be called <hi>Curation,</hi> and the art it ſelf a <hi>Curative Science</hi> from the principal part of the <hi>action,</hi> yet to ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and truly all this <hi>action</hi> of cure may be divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three abſtracted parts, and evidently diſtinct; namly, into the Cure of the cauſe, the Cure of the Diſeaſ, and the conſervation of the Spirits. For the Vital or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative Indication doth evidently, and by the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous grant of all Phyſitians belong alſo to this part of Medicine, and muſt be conſulted of in every curative <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> before it be undertaken. From whence it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that this part likewiſe of Medicine doth perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually conſerve, that is, provide and foreſee in every Cure, leaſt the Spirits ſhould receive more detriment than profit from the preſcribed remedies. Al theſe things therfore being thorowly weighed, we conclude, That a general Indicate is a certain concrete thing, and may be properly diſtinguiſhed into two general abſtracted <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> which are exerciſed in every part of Medicine, and that in the work of art they pertually make one compleat or complicated <hi>action.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, The general Indicant, namely the State of the Body, as frail and in motion may be divided, beſides the parts or obſtracted conſiderations already propoſed, into three kinds, or rather three ſucceeding kinds equally and alike concrete: namely, into a ſound ſtate, a diſeaſed ſtate and a neutrality. Theſe three
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:169706:148"/>
Species are the ſubjects of the three kinds of Method to Practice; namely the ſound ſtate of the Hygienal part, the diſeaſed ſtate of the <hi>Therapeutical,</hi> and the <hi>Neutral</hi> of the <hi>Prophylactical</hi> part. Theſe three ſtates are alſo concrete Indicants, and reſpectively Indicate what is particularly to be done, or what the Phyſitians Duty is in all thoſe Arts: namely a ſound ſtate indicateth the conſervation of health; a diſeaſed ſtate the removal of ſome affect, and the <hi>Neutral</hi> ſtate that the cauſ of an imminent malady ought to be corrected leaſt it break out into a Diſeaſ. Now theſe three Indicates are alike concrete, and each of them as we have proved above, abſtractively includeth both Conſervation and Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>Finally, In a Diſeaſed ſtate the action of correcting is diſſolved into two Species; into the correction of Cauſ, and the correction of the Diſeaſ, and ſo here may be diſcovered three kinds of abſtracted actions. For a diſeaſed ſtate brancheth it ſelf into three Species evidently abſtracted, into the Eſſence of a Diſeaſ, the cauſes of a Diſeaſ, and the Spirits or thoſe things which remain in this ſtate according to Nature. For thoſe things which are preternatural and indicate correction in general, are here ſeparated (as hath been ſaid) into two parts, namely into the Eſſence of a Diſeaſ, and the Cauſes of a Diſeaſ; and therfore there are three parts of this ſtate, each of which do formally and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly Indicate. Three kinds therfore (that we may put an end to this matter) of Indications are to be conſidered in this ſtate; namely, from the Eſſence of the Diſeaſ, the Curative; from the Cauſes the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative, and from the Spirits the Vital or Conſervative. To the Cauſes we refer all impediments of cure, as alſo vehement Symptoms, and ſuch as divert the Progreſs of
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:169706:148"/>
the Cure to themſelvs, for in this reſpect they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with the Nature of Cauſes. And thus much of Indications in general.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXV. Indications Curative.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have already affirmed that theſe Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are deduced from the Eſſence of the Diſeaſ, we ſhall therfore in this place ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly run over all the parts of the Eſſence of this Diſeaſ, that the Reader may perceive, what every one inſinuates to be done.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Therfore the Eſſence of this Diſeaſ partly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in a cold and moiſt diſtemper, this Diſeaſ ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in reſpect of this part of its Eſſence Indicateth, not only that all thoſe things are to be avoided, which are in any wiſe endued with a faculty to cheriſh and augment that diſtemper; but alſo that the aid of ſuch things ought to be implored, which may ſubdue the ſame; namely, hot and dry.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This Diſeaſ partly alſo conſiſteth in the want of inherent Spirits, therfore not only all thoſe things are to be avoided, which can any further ſcatter, and conſume the Spirits; but ſuch things muſt be ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted which are vertuous to reſtore, cheriſh, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them. Strong diſcuſſing remedies are therfore in this caſe to be declined, becauſ withal they conſume the Spirits: in like manner ſuch as are extreamly hot, for
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:169706:149"/>
they cauſ them to evaporate and vaniſh into air; but much more ſuch as have power to diſſolve the parts, as violent Catharticks. But the beſt nouriſhment muſt be choſen, and Medicines that are eaſy of Concoction, as much as may be, and amicable and benign to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Eſſence of this Diſeaſ conſiſteth part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a numbneſs or aſtoniſhment of the Spirits: this numbneſs inſinuates a prohibition and abſtinence from all ſuch things as vehemently make thick and fix the Spirits or any other waies ſtupifie them, as narotical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midies, and many Minerals, which participate of the nature of Lead, as Cerus, Litharge, Sinople or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milion; and all ſuch things as have power to excite the Spirits, to expel their ſtupefaction, and to render them active and agile, are to be made choice of, as exerciſes, motions, <hi>Frictions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Tone being over ſoft, looſ, flavid, and withered, indicateth an avoidance of ſuch things as are wont to mollifie, looſen and weaken the parts; and that ſuch Medicines are to be outwardly applied and inwardly given, as may render them more firm and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid. The ſame <hi>Tone</hi> as it is internally too brittle brings a ſuſpicion upon all ſuch things as abound much with an inward ſlipperineſs, and ſeemeth to deſire ſome rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or indeed aſtriction in thoſe things applied or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The corrupted Vital Conſtitution on the part of the Generation of the Vital Spirits is not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable; but on the part of the diſtribution of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Spirits, the inequality therof is of great importance, and indicateth a caution to be had of thoſe things which promove the flux of the Blood towards the Head, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of ſuch things as retard the paſſage therof to the firſt
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:169706:149"/>
affected parts, but that choice muſt be made of ſuch things as ſtir the Pulſes of the Arteries in the parts firſt affected, and temper thoſe that are in the Head. A ſlow and diminute current of the Blood through the firſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected parts indicateth the ſame things, namely an evo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Pulſ to thoſe parts. But an over facile and ſlippery paſſage of the Blood through the habit of the parts, is coincident in its indication with the ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perineſs of the <hi>Tone</hi> lately recited. A defect of the Vital Conſtitution on the part of the union ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vigorous and pleaſant between the Vital and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Spirits, indicateth an election of ſuch things as can both nouriſh and cheriſh the Spirits, and alſo excite them to a greater activity, and that their contraries ought to be avoided. The Vital heat, as deficient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates almoſt the ſame thing as a cold diſtemper, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that regard be had withal to the ſtrength of the Heart and Arteries, and to the vigor of the Vital Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The unequal Nutrition Indicateth thoſe things which promove the even and impartial diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Aliment and Heat. Or indeed that which is too liberal to the parts that are nouriſhed beyond a due meaſure; the extenuation of the parts requireth a fuller Nouriſhment. The irregular magnitude of the Head, chiefly things extenuant and ſuch as are of the flux from the Head. The Tumors of the Bones indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the ſame thing; the crookedneſs of the Bones re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſuch things as attract the Aliment to the hollow ſide, as moderate rubbings; but things repreſſing chiefly on the gibbous and bunched ſide, as ſtrong bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. The bending of the Joynts, inſinuateth an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial erection of them, as much as is poſſible. The narrowneſs of the Breaſt pointeth to Pectorals, and ſuch
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:169706:150"/>
things as have a faculty to dilate the Breaſt; but the ſharpneſs therof indicateth ſuch things as have a dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Vertue.</p>
            <p>Sevently, The imperfect diſtribution of Animal Spirits, and ſomwhat defective in the firſt affected parts indicateth <hi>Cephalicals,</hi> and ſuch things as facilitate the diſtribution, as exerciſes, rubbings, and the like. A defect of due ſtretching in the Nerves, or Nervous and Fibrous parts, indicateth thoſe things as <hi>Corroborate</hi> the Nerves and ſtrengthen the parts. Thus much of Indications Curative, the Preſervative follow.</p>

         <div n="26" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. XXVI. Indications preſervative.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe Indications are deduced either from the Antecedent or the preſent cauſes of a Diſeaſ. Thoſe which flow from the former kind of cauſes concern the <hi>Prophylactical</hi> Part: here we only propound thoſe which proceed from cauſes that are preſent and contained in the Body; namly, from common cauſes, or ſuch as are proper to this Diſeaſ.</p>
            <p>Now although that common cauſes do not ſeem im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly to attain to the production of the Eſſence of a Diſeaſ; yet even in this reſpect that they are eſteemed an impediment, and may retard the cure, they Indicate their taking away.</p>
            <p>Theſe cauſes are either impurities, or excrementitious
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:169706:150"/>
humors collected and impacted in the firſt paſſages, which unleſs they be taken away, do not only infect the nouriſhment inward, but they ſomwhat dul, or otherwiſe hinder the appropriate Medicines. They indicate ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an evacuation either by a gentle vomit, or by a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive purgation, as occaſion ſhal rather perſwade to this or that: or they are common cauſes deeper imbited into the Parts of the Body, and theſe alſo require an evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. But ſeing that according to this kind of common cauſes it is at the ſame time driven away and almoſt with the ſame Medicaments, as are the cauſes which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to this Diſeaſ, we ſhal conjoyn both the kinds of them in this preſent conſideration.</p>
            <p>The cauſes therfore which are proper to this Diſeaſ, as alſo the Common cauſes which have a deeper pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration into the Body, may be divided into Blood and <hi>Cacochymical</hi> humors. The Blood indeed, although it be rather deficient than redundant in the firſt Affected parts, yet in the Head for the moſt part it requires a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular evacuation, which uſually is performed by ſcari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Veins in the hollow of the Ear. Hither likewiſe we may partly refer bliſters raiſed between the firſt and ſecond turning Joynt of the Neck, although theſe perhaps may relate over and above in part to the <hi>Cacochymical</hi> humors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cachochymical</hi> humors are divided into thoſe which ſtil flow in the channel of the Veins, and into thoſe which are impacted in certain parts of the Body. The cauſes or humors flowing in the Veins do (primarily and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally) Indicate their evacuation. But if they be unapt for motion (as to the execution) then they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſom previous preparation. But becauſe it happens for the moſt part, that not al the humors are equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt, but that ſom are ſufficiently flexible, and others not
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:169706:151"/>
ſo, but reſiſt the Medecines, in this caſe they indicate a leſs evacuation and then a preparation.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Theſe humors in the chanel of the Veyns may be ſubdivided into Feaveriſh (namly, if there be a putrid Feaver) and not Feaveriſh. The Feaveriſh hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are either ſwelling, or not ſwelling. The ſwelling, that is, thoſe which are unquiet, or impetuouſly agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, do Indicate a ſudden evacuation, at leaſt a leſſer, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs perhaps they are carried of their accord to the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and more ignoble parts, as it happens in the ſmall Pox, the Meazels, and the like Affects. But if a Feaver be preſent, and that acute, and yet the humors are not ſwelling, they chiefly Indicate that peculiar preparation which they cal coction, that by this means they may be obedient to the Medecine to be aftergiven, and than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacution, but if the Feaver not be acute but Chronical, although the matter be not irritated, and yet ſom part of it be ſufficiently flexible; in this caſe, a leſſer evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is firſt indicated at any time of the Diſeaſ, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the coction of the relicts, that they alſo in their time may be evacuated.</p>
            <p>The humors contained in the Veins which are not Feaveriſh, if they are fluxible, they firſt indicate evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: but becauſe in this Affect ſlow, groſs, and clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my humors are almoſt perpetually preſent, preparation (at leaſt wher a leſſer evacuation hath gon before) is firſt Indicated; and indeed the viſcous humors Indicate incident, and the thick attenuant remedies. Again, when the Diſeaſ is very Chronical and extended to many months; yea, perhaps to a year and upwards, it is not to be ſuppoſed that the whol matter cauſing the Diſeaſ can at once be prepared or evacuated; wherfore in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect it Indicateth, that we inſiſt upon things prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and evacuant by turns. Beſides we muſt know that
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:169706:151"/>
Cholerick humors require one preparation and evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Melancholy humors another, flegm another, and watry humors another. And that the preparation and purgation is Indicated variouſly according to the diverſity of the humors commixed with the Blood.</p>
            <p>The humors that are impacted in certain parts of the Body do much more require preparation before they are evacuated; according to that of <hi>Hippocrates, When you would purg a Body, you muſt firſt make it fluxible.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therdoth a certain general purgation ſuffice to ſubdu theſ humors, but ſuch a preparation is required, that hath a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar reference to that part, in which they are inherent, and therfore the humors in the Liver require one kind of preparation, thoſe in the Lungs another, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Finally, Seing that the propounded kinds of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, after they are evacuated, may grow and breed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; they Indicate an avoyding of ſuch things which may diſpoſe the Body to an eaſy generation of ſuch hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors: And thus much of Indications Preſervative, it remaineth now that we conſider the Vital and Conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative.</p>

               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The due Stretching of the Parts depending upon the Influx of the Brain.</p>
            <p>All theſe things becauſe life conſiſteth in them, are called <hi>Vital Indications.</hi> But among Authors for the moſt part they are known by the common name of the Spirits, but this name is ſomwhat to groſs, ſeing that in propriety of ſpeech, the Spirits are radicated in the ſaid Conſtitutions, and are faculties of them. Yet we have no deſign to innovate the cuſtom of ſpeech, provided that the things may be underſtood as it is.</p>
            <p>Theſe Indicants ſo long as they continue firm and ſound, they require only a general and ordinary conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by the right uſe of the ſix non-Natural things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but when they are all alike vitiated or obnoxious to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent hurt, they require not only a general conſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but ſuch an one likewiſe, as is mixt with cure and preſervation. Again, Where ſome one Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ſom one part therof is depraved more than the reſt or ſubject to ſuch depravation, beſides the general pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, it requireth in like manner an eſpecial one to be aſſociated to the peculiar Curation. Laſtly, When a Conſtitution Subject to error, or actually erroneous is fixed to ſom certain part, it doth high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſpecify that conſervation; namly, that reſpect may be alſo had of the part ſo labouring more than the reſt.</p>
            <p>But becauſe ſom ſay, That the Vital Indication is the only, and that Conſervation is the ſimple end, and that they cannot be further ſubdivided, becauſe that all things, which are according to Nature are comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the word Spirits, and that they Indicate one Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; namly, the preſervation of themſelvs. We grant indeed that the Spirits, if (as we have already noted) they be improperly taken for their cauſes; namly, the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:169706:153"/>
three Conſtitutions aforeſaid, may in one word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend al things which are according to Nature, but then this word muſt be <hi>Generical,</hi> and diviſible into three ſpecies; namly, the three Conſtitutions, as Spirits Natural, Vital, and Animal. We grant alſo that the end, or that the Indicated action is one; namly, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, but by the unity of the <hi>Genus,</hi> not of the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate ſpecies. For thoſe very things which are according to Nature, however they agree in the <hi>Genus,</hi> yet in the ſpecies they may differ among themſelvs, and require a different conſervation; yea, it is poſſible that thoſ things which conſerv the Spirits on one part may impugn them on the other; as for example: Wine given may in one reſpect cheriſh and ſtrengthen the Vital Spirits, or rather the Vital Conſtitution, but in the interim it may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and debilitate the Animal Spirits, or the Animal Conſtitution. In like manner the Temperament re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth one preſervation, the Structure of the Organs another, and the Continuity another. Yea, the very different Conſtitution of the parts Indicates a various conſervation, neither do we after one and the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or by the ſame actions provide for the ſpecial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Liver, Lungs, Brain, &amp;c. Wherfore when ſom one Conſtitution is more infirm then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or when ſom one part is weaker than another, it Indicates a proper conſervation peculiar and ſpecial to it ſelf, and therfore both Conſervation and Conſervants may be divided into their Species. For the Conſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; the Conſervants appropriated to the Animal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, differ from thoſe which are deſtinated to the Vital or Natural: And from hence the three firſt kinds of Conſervation are to be deducted, namly, the Conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Animal, the Vital, and the Natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. In like manner the Conſervation of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:169706:153"/>
is accompliſhed by the uſe of the Hepaticals, and of the Lungs by <hi>Pectorals,</hi> &amp;c. Yea, all parts of an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent diverſity do ſubdivide the conſervation into ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more ſpecies. Thus much of the diviſion of Conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation into its ſpecies.</p>
            <p>Moreover, The ſame Conſervation ſeemeth to be further diviſible unto its parts. For this Conſervation is ſomwhat complicated, and doth not only relate to ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but in ſom ſort to contraries, to wit, Indicates both Curative and Preſervative, and either permitteth or diſalloweth thoſe ſame things being eſtimated with the Spirits. It ſeemeth therfore to be branched into three parts, into an election of like matters, into an election of contraries under a certain condition, and into a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of the ſame under a diverſe condition.</p>
            <p>The election of like things is the moſt appropriated <hi>Action</hi> to Conſervation, and ſeems withal to have refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to two kinds of things alike; namely, ſuch as are eaſily aſſimilated, and are properly nouriſhments, and ſuch which although they cannot be aſſimilated in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their ſubſtance, yet they contain within the ſame qualities like unto the conſtitution of certain parts, in reſpect wherof they are reputed amicable and famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to Nature, and do cheriſh and ſtrengthen certain parts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You wil ſay,</hi> Theſe are indeed Alterants and do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the kind of contraries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We anſwer,</hi> That in a diverſ reſpect they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to each kind, but in as much as they obtain qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities like unto the du Nature of the parts, although o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they alter ſom ſmal matter, yet they are to be referred to the ſimilaries. For the very nouriſhments do in ſom degree alter, and are directly contrary to empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and conſervation it ſelf doth implicitly include a
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:169706:154"/>
certain correction, as we have ſhewed above. Now theſe indeed in regard of a middle nature, which they have between ſimilaries and Alterants, are not called Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, but Strengthners, Conſervants, and Cordials; Again, theſe are Indicated as Conſervants by the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar debility of the Spirits, and as to be elected, and not only permitted, and ſo they are eſteemed in the Books of Practical Authors.</p>
            <p>The Permiſſion of a remedy ſomwhat contrary to Nature doth likewiſe belong to this Indication. For ſuch is the dignity and valu of this Indication, as it ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons both the Curative and Preſervative Indicates to an examination before they are reduced into practice, and doth not only moderate and limit the quality and quantity of the remedy, but alſo the very time of repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, yea, whatſoever appertaineth to the uſe therof, or the manner of uſing it, and al this leaſt in any wiſe it ſhould exceed the Spirits of the Patient, or be injurious to them: nor is the excellency of it thus circumſcribed, but it requireth more; namly, that more profit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage may accrue to the things, according to Nature by impugnation of the Diſeaſ, then hurt or detriment by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny violence offered to Nature. And under this Law and Condition. Vital Indication permitteth many things to be don, which of themſelvs are contrary to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, yet always in favor of health, never to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of Life.</p>
            <p>A prohibition of a contrary is altogether a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Action</hi> of this Indication, and by a kind of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <hi>dictates</hi> this or that thing not to be don, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were otherwiſe Indicated) becauſ perhaps it endangers life it ſelf, or brings more diſadvantage than benefit of health to the parts. And this is the third and laſt force and uſe of this Indication. We ſhall
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:169706:154"/>
now in one word apply theſe things to the preſent Diſeaſ.</p>
            <p>All Conſtitutions in this <hi>Affect</hi> are very weak and infirm; and this is manifeſt from the bare conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this tender age. But the Natural doth yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuffer by the force of the firſt Eſſence of the Diſeaſ; and from hence alſo the Vital is ſomwhat weakned, and indeed neither doth the Animal eſcape wholly free, as was ſhewed above. Wherfore both a general and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a particular regard muſt be had to theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, as wel in the <hi>Election</hi> of Similaries, as in the permiſſion or prohibition of contraries.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Therfore in this <hi>Affect</hi> you muſt make choice of the beſt nouriſhments, ſuch as are eaſy of <hi>concoction,</hi> and as neer as you can agreable to the cuſtom and age of the Patient, to the time of the year, &amp;c. the contraries muſt be abandoned, namly, ſuch things as nouriſh little, are difficult of digeſtion, and incongruous to the cuſtom, age, and ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Thoſe things muſt be choſen which cheriſh and ſtrengthen the weaker Conſtitutions, and the parts that are moſt <hi>Affected,</hi> and theſe muſt be either exhibited ſeverally, or they muſt be mingled with nouriſhments or Medicines; but ſuch things as are neither ſerviceable to this ſcope, nor otherwiſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, muſt be totally avoyded.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Benign and gentle evacuants, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſufficiently <hi>corrected,</hi> muſt be allowed in a moderate quantity, juſt and du interval of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſerved. But the contrary things; namely, violent and fierce purgers, eſpecially ſuch as are apt to diſſolv the parts, or are exhibited in an undu quantity, or too often repeated, are forbidden.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:169706:155"/>
Fourthly, Remedies alterant, or ſuch as prepare the humors, or <hi>correct</hi> the Diſeaſ muſt be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; ſuch alſo as are friendly and familiar to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or ſuch as may be made ſuch by good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that is, by compoſition or ſufficient <hi>correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Remedies violently alterant, extream hot, and vehemently diſcutient, or any other which in any wiſe reſolv and diſſipate the parts.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXVIII. The uſe and right adminiſtrations of the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations</hi> aforeſaid.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving propounded the three kinds of ſimple Indications, and deduced them into their loweſt ſpecies, we ſhal in the next place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider <hi>the right uſe &amp; adminiſtration</hi> of them. The exact knowledg wherof ſeems impoſſible to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without rode and experience. For it deſcendeth unto Individuals, and comprehends not only the <hi>Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of a thing among ſo many Indicates ſimply to be don in the Species, but alſo <hi>the invention of quantity, place, form, time, order, and matter of the remedy to be exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Conſent</hi> and <hi>Diſſent</hi> of Indications do contribute much to this invention. Now the <hi>Conſent</hi> may be two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold: of <hi>Coindication</hi> and <hi>Permiſſion. Permiſſion</hi> may be either an <hi>Advantage</hi> or a <hi>Loſs</hi> to him that permitteth
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:169706:155"/>
or neither of them. A <hi>Permiſſion</hi> that cannot be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>without hurt;</hi> muſt never be allowed without the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt circumſpection, and ſo much the greater, as the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage may be the more to him that permitteth. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Permittent may part with ſomwhat of his private right to advance the publick good, yet in reſpect that he is a member of the whol he is ſuppoſed to be a gainer.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Diſſent of Indicants</hi> is twofold; namly, either <hi>Contradictory</hi> or <hi>Contrary.</hi> The <hi>Contradictory</hi> among the Books is called <hi>Interdiction</hi> or <hi>Prohibition,</hi> and for the moſt part it is appropriated to the Spirits, unto w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> in this reſpect we muſt always yeeld obedience. The <hi>Contrary</hi> is called <hi>Contra-indication,</hi> and this doth not ſimply forbid, but ſo far forth as it undergoeth the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of an impediment, or ſom more urgent Indicate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Where <hi>Indicants</hi> conſent, either by <hi>Coindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> or <hi>Permiſſion,</hi> ſatisfaction if it be feaſible muſt be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to al the <hi>Indicates:</hi> But if this cannot be performed Medicines of that Nature are to be preferred before the reſt, which are correſpondent to moſt, or at leaſt to the moſt urgent Scopes. But if ſuch ſimples cannot be found out, then you muſt inſtitute an apt compoſition of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ſimples one with another.</p>
            <p>The Eſſential parts of this Diſeaſ, although they are very various, yet is there not any conſiderable diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among them, and nothing hindreth but in a great part they may be conſidered together. For Medicines temperatly hot and dry, may at once cheriſh the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Spirits, and perhaps conduce to the ſcattring of the numbneſs in them, and withal ſomwhat fortify the <hi>Tone</hi> of the parts, and facilitate the equal diſtribution of the Blood, and conſequently the equality of the Nutrition: alſo it may increaſe vigor in the Vital and Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:169706:156"/>
proritate the Arteries in the firſt <hi>affected</hi> parts, and ſtrengthen the Nervs: unto which Heads almoſt al the Indicates of the Eſſence of a Diſeaſ may not unaptly be referred. Moreover, the Spirits alſo, although they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit all extream hot things, yet they allow of theſe as mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derat, and very congruous to Nature. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner there is little or no particular repugnance between theſe cauſes and the Indicates, albeit in reſpect of time and the order of adminiſtration ſom diſſent may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, as we ſhall ſee afterwards in due place.</p>
            <p>Wherfore in what reſpect and how far theſe agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether whilſt we intend a cure, we do at once reſpect not only the Spirits, but in ſom ſort the cauſes, by chooſing ſuch curative remedies, or by mingling ſuch ingredients with them, which are able both to attenuate the thick matter, to cut into the viſcous, to open the obſtructed paſſages, and the like. In like manner, whilſt we are chiefly imployed either in preſervation, or in the root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of cauſes, we make choice of ſuch evacuants, or elſ we compound them with ſuch remedies, as are alſo partly contrary to the Diſeaſ. And all theſe things we do to that purpoſe; as that (as hath been ſaid) we may be ſubſervient to the moſt intentions we can.</p>
            <p>Now having found out the <hi>actions</hi> ſimply requiſit in the Species, in the next place we ſhal enquire out their <hi>du circumſtances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. In regard that this is a great Diſeaſ it requireth a <hi>great quantity of the Remedy,</hi> in reſpect of it ſelf. For a <hi>Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> unequal to the Diſeaſ cannot extirpate it. It is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary therfore that the doſe of the Medicine be equally to the magnitude of the <hi>Affect.</hi> But in this Diſeaſ the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits permit not ſo great a quantity of <hi>Remedies</hi> to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at once. Wherfore that quantity muſt be divided &amp; given by turns. For this is a Chronical Diſeaſ, and of
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:169706:156"/>
ſlow motion, neither doth it neceſſarily require an haſty Cure, and although the Spirits cannot wel endure either vehement Remedies or ſuch as are given in a large doſe, yet they permit the uſe of Evacuant Medicins by an <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſis.</hi> Wherfore by turns, we muſt ſomtimes make uſe of Remedies Preparatory, ſomtimes Evacuant, ſomtimes Alterant, and ſomtimes ſtrengthing.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For ſo much as belongeth to <hi>the place of adminiſtration,</hi> the general Rule is, that the remedy ought to arive at the ſeat, and penetrate to the very Cauſe of the Diſeaſ. If therfore it muſt have a paſſage into the Veſſels, it muſt be taken at the Mouth; but if it will ſuffice to touch only the thick Guts, it muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by the Fundament. If the humors be naturally ready to move upwards, expel them by vomit; if down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards evacuat them by ſiege. In like manner you muſt humor the inclination of Nature, and root out the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes by ſpitting, by Urin, or by ſweating. Particular e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuations muſt be inſtituted in the very affected parts, or in the parts adjacent. For ſo the force of the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy doth the more ſurely make way to the ſeat of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſ and the morbifical Cauſ. And for the ſame reaſon external and topical Medicines muſt be applied to the next convenient place. Yet you muſt know that there is a certain Sympathy between ſom parts, in which caſe the remedies ar frequently adminiſtred to the part, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with that conſent intercedeth, and neither to the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nor the adjacent part.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>The form of the Medicament</hi> doth partly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Rule laſt propounded. For if the ſcope be to lenifie the Jaws or the Windpipe, we chuſe a lic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or lapping form, that by degrees the remedy may ſlide over the affected parts, and ſtay the longer upon them. In like manner, if the Stomach be affected, we
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:169706:157"/>
often preſcribe Pils, Pouders or Electuaries, that they may the longer abide in the Stomach. To the Kidnies we rather deſign liquid things, that they may the more eaſily be carried down to them with the wheyiſh part of the Blood. The forms do alſo in ſom part depend upon the very nature of the Diſeaſ, as in burning Feavers li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid things are for the moſt part convenient, dry things are ſcarce admitted; on the other ſide, in moiſt Diſeaſes, and when the Belly is overſoluble, more ſolid forms are preferred. Finally, the forms of the Medicines do alſo partly depend upon the nature of the Ingredients. So Caſſia worketh moſt effectually in the form of a <hi>Bolus;</hi> Hartſhorn, Coral, and the like in the form of a Pouder; in like manner bitter things, ſuch as beget a vomiting, and ſtinking things are concealed in the form of Pills; ſomtimes alſo they are guilded, or elſ they are enwrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in Wafers, and exhibited in the form of a <hi>Bolus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it muſt here be noted, that for the moſt part the form of the Remedy is not ſo conſiderable, as it gives place to the more eaſie and commodious adminiſtration, in reſpect of the Admiſſion or Reception of the Sick. For many cannot ſwallow Pills, others preſently reject their Potions by vomit, &amp; others are perhaps averſ from other forms. In this Affect, in regard that all Children almoſt are loth to take Phyſick, that form is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the reſt, which ſhall be obſerved to be leaſt diſtaſtful to them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, As for <hi>the time of action,</hi> you muſt ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to ſit your adminiſtrations, that they may as little as poſſible be interupted with times of eating, exerciſe, or ſleep, for at this age the Spirits are ſcarce preſerved ſound and perfect, without an interpoſition of thoſe things by juſt internals.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:169706:157"/>
Remedies evacuant, opening, attenuate and incident, muſt be taken early in the morning upon an empty ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; and if they muſt be repeated the ſame day, four of the Clock in the afternoon (upon an empty ſtomach likewiſe) is the moſt ſeaſonable hour. Strengthning and aſtringent Medicines, and ſuch as provoke ſleep, are to be taken rather in the evening than in the morning; but perhaps ſom of theſe are moſt agreable after meals.</p>
            <p>Medicines that are mingled with the nouriſhment, ought to be gratful to the Palat, leſt they ſubvert the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and hinder concoction, or cauſ a loathing of the meat, or elſ empair the Spirits.</p>
            <p>As for the order of proceeding, there occur two gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rules. The former is, That that muſt firſt be don, which being premiſed makes way for the following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, and therfore that ought firſt to be removed which hath the conſideration of an impediment in reſpect of what muſt follow. The later is, That we muſt ever give our firſt help to the more urgent and weighty Indicant, unleſs ſom impediment intervene.</p>
            <p>If the Queſtion therfore be, <hi>Whether the Diſeaſ, or the Cauſ of the Diſeaſ doth firſt require the help of Phyſick?</hi> The anſwer wil be obvious according to the firſt Rule: For the cauſes are reflected upon under the notion of an impediment in reſpect of the Cure of the Diſeaſ; for they cheriſh it, and infringe the vertu<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Medicins. Wherfore, before that we are intent upon the vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of the Diſeaſ, we premiſe all poſſible endeavors to root out the Cauſ, or at leaſt to leſſen, abate and retund it, that it may oppoſe no conſiderable force to retard the rooting out of the Diſeaſ. Yet in the interim whilſt we are buſie in the removal of the Cauſes, the Eſſence of the Diſeaſ muſt not be totally neglected, as we have before admoniſhed. Yea when we have ſo ſubdued the Cauſe
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:169706:158"/>
that it cannot for the preſent much interupt the Cure, we may (the Cauſes not being utterly over-come and caſt out) the more diligently and earneſtly attempt the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of the affect; yet with this condition, That if the Cauſes revert and becom new impediments, that then we are obliged preſently to undertake the ſubduing and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation of them: ſo that in this Chronical Affect, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Cauſes, ſomtimes the Diſeaſ muſt be reſiſted by turns: and the Spirits do better undergo this change of action, than if we ſhould continualy make our battery againſt the Cauſes, till they were abſolutely rooted out.</p>
            <p>Moreover, When the Cauſes of the Diſeaſ in this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect are unapt for motion by reaſon of their toughneſs, groſneſs, and perhaps ſetledneſs; they muſt firſt be freed from this impediment and prepared before they are eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated. For according to the Rule of the great Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, <hi>Quae movenda ſunt, fluida prius facere oportet.</hi> In like manner, that thickneſs, toughneſs and ſetledneſs of matter, if it be preſent, indicate Remedies attenuant, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident and opening. But theſe things are not ſafly taken the impurities ſtill flowing back<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>into the firſt Paſſages, for then perhaps they are carried along with the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines into the Veins, and more defile the Blood, or at leaſt hinder the efficacy of the Remedies. Theſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have the nature of an impediment, and muſt be in the firſt place removed.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Univerſal Evacuants muſt be premiſed before Particular and Topical Remedies, eſpecially where it is not permitted at once to mind both intentions. For the Univerſal Cauſes flowing in the Body are eaſily ſurroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the room of Particular Evacuations, and renew the Afflux to the firſt affected part: but the thinner part of Particular Cauſes and that which is moſt apt for
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:169706:158"/>
motion is evacuated, but the thicker perhaps is more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted. Wherfore Univerſal Cauſes yet flowing to and fro in the Body, as conſidered are Impediments in reſpect of Particular Evacuation, and by conſequence muſt be firſt expelled.</p>
            <p>The latter Rule was, <hi>That we muſt releeve the more urgent and weighty Indicant firſt, unleſs there be an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of ſom impediment.</hi> That is termed an urgent Indicant which threatneth the moſt danger. Now every ſuch Indicant is ſuppoſed to induce great afflictions into the Body, and not without manifeſt danger to waſt the Spirits. Therfore in this reſpect, we muſt ſomtimes firſt help the Diſeaſ, the Cauſ being neglected: Somtimes alſo we muſt neglect both the Diſeaſ and the Cauſes, and adreſs our endeavors to the pacification of the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms, as in a vehement Flux of the Belly, long Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings, profuſe and immoderat Sweating, and the like. But even in theſe caſes, we muſt have a prudent regard both to the Diſeaſ and the Cauſes, and when the urgent Symptom is corrected, or the violence of the Diſeaſ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, then we muſt return to the regular Method of proceeding; for this Rule belongs not to the ordinary and legitimate order of Cure, but to the Method of Neceſſity.</p>
            <p>Moreover, to perfect the right adminiſtration of Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, there is required an exact and accurat know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the <hi>Medical Matter</hi> whereof we ſhal diſcourſ in the ſubſequent Chapters.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXIX. The Medical Matter anſwering to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications</hi> propoſed, and firſt the <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgical.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE <hi>Medical Matter</hi> muſt be found out by Experience and <hi>Analogiſmes,</hi> or Arguments drawn by an anſwerable neceſſity from the Cauſ to the Effect; although the truth is we conceive not any other Reaſonings to be abſolutly excluded. It is vulgarly and not unaptly diſtributed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three kinds, The <hi>Chirurgical,</hi> the <hi>Pharmateutical,</hi> and the <hi>Diatetical:</hi> Of theſe in their order.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chirurgical</hi> commonly received and approved in this Affect, and famous above the reſt, are chiefly two; <hi>Scarification of the Ears,</hi> and <hi>little Fountains</hi> or <hi>Iſſues.</hi> But our enquiry (as we ſhal ſee anon) ſhal be extended to many more, namly of Cuppin-Glaſſes, Leeches, Bliſters, Ligatures, and Swathing-bands: But the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a Vein the Spirits cannot brook, as every one knows, who but obſerves the frailty of the age, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuation of the habit of the parts, and the ſmalneſs of the Veins.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scarification of the Ears</hi> ſhal lead our diſcourſ. The <hi>Empericks</hi> who undertake the cure of this Diſeaſ, make more of it than one would imagin. For in their practice they celerate it with great vaporing, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it ſcarce hope for a happy cure. But we, although we
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:169706:159"/>
diſallow not this kind of remedy, have ſeen many Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſucceſsfully recovered without the uſe therof. And they themſelves who attribute moſt unto it, for the moſt part take away no conſiderable portion of Blood. Yet ſome affirm that they have ſeen a large quantity of Blood drawn away with good event. However it be, it is credible that thoſe Children do with moſt eaſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure this remedy, and obtain moſt profit by the uſe of it, which are of a Sanguin complexion and wel habited, and who are affected with an <hi>Alogotrophy,</hi> rather than an <hi>Atrophy</hi> or a Conſumption, or any other remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble extenuation of the parts. Our Practitioners for moſt part repeat this operation two or three times in a week. They ſeldom do it with an Inſtrument or ſharp Pen-knife, but moſt commonly with an ordinary blunt Knife, taking no notice of the pain and crying of the Child. Moreover, For the moſt part they perform it in the hollow of the Ear, but ſome extend it to the inward and outward circumference of the upper part of the Ear, yea to the whol circumference. No man hitherto as we know have attempted the Scarification of the hinder ſide of the Ear, although indeed it is not eaſie to give a reaſon, why it ſhould conduce leſs being adminiſtred there than in the hollow part.</p>
            <p>Yet it may be lawful for us to offer our conjectures why the hollow of the Ear ſhould be choſen before the other parts for this operation, which notwithſtanding we will not confidently aſſert, although we ſuppoſe we can at leaſt probably aſſert it, if that be true which the moſt diligent Chyrurgion <hi>Fubricius Hildanus</hi> hath written in his <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 4. <hi>Centur.</hi> 1. <hi>de nervo quinti parts:</hi> For this conjecture is grounded upon this Obſervation, and if that be ruinous this perhaps muſt periſh with it. The Conjecture is this, <hi>The diſtribution and uſe of the</hi>
               <pb n="312" facs="tcp:169706:160"/>
               <hi>Nerve and of the fifth Pair before mentioned being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, Scarification in the hollow of the Ear may very conveniently both free that Nerve from any kind of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and likewiſe ſhake off the numbneſs, and give it vigor.</hi> For the hollow of the Ear is the next place unto it which we can come at with an inſtrument. Wherfore evacuation being here made may immediatly drive away the matter which commonly oppreſſeth the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that Nerve, and withal cauſing pain and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the heat, and may drive out all ſtupidneſs from within it, and ad vigor unto it. If this Nerve therfore (as that famous Chyrurgion affirmeth) or a part therof be diſtributed unto the Marrow of the Back and never forſakes the Marrow of the Back, but ſhooteth out little Branches with the Nervs of the Marrow of the Back to the ends of the very Legs and Feet; it may eaſily be granted, that this Nerve thus delivered from obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thus excited and having gotten vigor, may likewiſe in ſome manner excite the Marrow of the Back it ſelf, and all the Nerves from thence ariſing, which by that opinion it doth accompany to the very end of the Body, and imprint ſome vigor in them. Wherfore Scarificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being made in that place muſt needs be of greater ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy, than if it were inſtituted in any other part of the ſame Ear, more remote from the aforeſaid Nerve. The ſame may almoſt be ſaid concerning the little wound here made by a blunt Knife. For ſome Practical Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians affirm that the excellency of this operation relats not ſo much to the quantity of the Blood to be drawn, as to the ſtirring up of pain in that part; which any man may eaſily reduce to the ſtirring up of the vigor of the Nerve of the Fifth Pair.</p>
            <p>But omitting this Conjecture we will propound ſome other Conſiderations, in reſpect wherof this Scarifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:169706:160"/>
may be uſeful in this affect. Firſt, By this means we obtain a certain particular evacuation of the Head, which part, if any other is in this Affect oppreſſed with a particular fulneſs. Secondly, By the very evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Blood we ſomwhat correct the thickneſs and toughneſs therof, and by conſequence we promove the more equal diſtribution of it, and a more regular and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Nouriſhment of the Parts. Thirdly, By this means we in ſome ſort drive away the aſtoniſhment of the parts.</p>
            <p>It muſt be noted that this operation when it perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a particular and local evacuation, doth not ſimply deſerve the firſt place in the Method of Cure, but muſt follow in its order, Univerſals being premiſed.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, It ſeems to be ridiculous and ſuperſtitious which ſome are buſie about when they adminiſter this Scarification; whilſt they faſten the Blood of the right Ear ſuck'd up into Wool to the left <hi>Hypochondry,</hi> and the Blood of the left to the right. Thus much of Scarification.</p>
            <p>Iſſues in this Diſeaſ are much approved, and we have known ſome Children cured only by the help of this means. For it doth not only perform all thoſe things, which even now we aſcribed to the Scarification of the Ears, but more particularly it is a powerful remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Hydrocephalus,</hi> both Curative and Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and very much conduceth to leſſen the unuſual mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of the Head, and to evacuate the ſuperfluous watrineſs therof. And laſtly, to repreſs the inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate encreaſ of the Bones. Alſo it manifeſtly drieth up the too much humidity of the Spinal Marrow, exciteth heat, ſtrengthens the Nerves, and expelleth the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
            <p>Now becauſ this kind of remedy is properly a little
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:169706:161"/>
Ulcer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and cauſeth ſome ſmall pain to the Child that hath it, and bringeth dayly ſome trouble to the Nurſ, it ought not to be preſcribed, unleſs the greatneſs of the Diſeaſ be ſuch that we deſpair to conquer it by other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies without the concurrence of this.</p>
            <p>This little Fountain muſt be made between the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and Third turning Joynt of the Neck. Some Burn it with actual Cauteriſing, but we diſapprove of this way in regard of the vehemence of the pain: Some effect it with a potential Cauteriſing: but neither do we like this, becauſ all Cauſticks are adverſ to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of an Infant, inſinuating ſome venemous quality, and at leaſt do too much diſſipate the Spirits, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the parts. Therfore we allow rather of an Iſſue made by Simple inciſion with a ſharp Penknife.</p>
            <p>Some make uſe of Iron tongues contrived for this purpoſe, wherwith they take hold of the Skin, the place of inciſion being firſt mark'd with ink, and by a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate compreſſion they dull the ſenſ of the part, and then they thruſt in the Pen-knife through the middle of the tongs which is pierced with a longiſh hole, and ſo they make the inciſion. Having made the wound they ſtop in either an Artificial or a Natural Peaſe, putting upon it a digeſtive Plaiſter: upon this they wrap a Paper or a linnen cloath divers times doubled, and faſten to it as it were a Buckler made of ſome ſolid matter, unto which four ſwathing bands are ſewed; thus much of Iſſues. In the next place we ſhall examin ſome other kind of Chyrurgical Operations.</p>
            <p>And firſt Leeches offer themſelves. Truly we have not yet ſufficiently tryed how beneficial the application of them may be in this Affect. But if we conſult Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, we ſuppoſe that more hurt than advantage may be expected from this remedy. For if they are applied to
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:169706:161"/>
any part of the Head, by reaſon of their continual ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king they would eaſily cauſ a more violent afflux of the Blood to thoſe parts. And if they be applied to other parts, they draw the Blood from the parts which before had too little.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Cuppinglaſſes are not (we conceive) ſo dangerous as needleſs; indeed we altogether reject thoſe that are miniſtred with Scarification, not only for the Reaſons juſt now deduced from the Leeches, but being moved both by fear of dejecting the Spirits by reaſon of the pain, and alſo in regard of the troubleſomneſs of the adminiſtration. Cuppin Glaſſes without Scarification, as we began to ſay, ſeem not refuſable either by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, or the Diſeaſ, or the cauſes of the Diſeaſ. But theſe are very little effectual, and we leave it to be perpended, whether the profit ariſing from the uſe of them, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, can recompence the trouble of the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs it may happen by reaſon of the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſome other Diſeaſ, that the uſe of them may be of ſome moment, as in a Pleuriſie, a Phrenſy, and wher ſom dangerous Flux is iminent againſt ſom princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal part; in which caſe, thoſe perhaps that are adhibited with Scarification, may be admitted in great and ſtrong Children. But then you muſt apply them to the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Joynts of the Neck, the Shoulders, the Hanches, to the inner parts of the Thighs, to the ſoals of the Feet, and to other places as the peculiar complicated af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſhall require.</p>
            <p>In the mean time it muſt be noted, that in an age ſo tender, you muſt make uſe of very ſmal <hi>Cuppin-glaſſes,</hi> and that they muſt be applyed with a leſs flame then they are wont to be in others of mans eſtate, and that the ſcarifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, if at all it be admitted, muſt be don with a gentle hand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:169706:162"/>
Thirdly, As for Bliſters, although hitherto we have not had ſufficient trial of them, and although we baniſh from this Diſeaſ both ſeptical applications, becauſ they diſſolve the parts, and alſo cauſtical, becauſe they pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate deeper and produce a cruſted ſubſtance, yet we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture that thoſe <hi>Pyrotical</hi> remedies which only raiſe Bliſters in the Skin may be ſomtimes profitably admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>You wil ſay that Cantharides wherwith they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly made are extream hot, and beſides ſuſpected to be of a venemous quality.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We anſwer,</hi> That we may not here inſert any thing of the qualities of Cantharides, we grant that which is aſſerted. But becauſ they are adminiſtred only to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward little Skin, and only to a little part therof not much extended, and becauſ as ſoon as the bliſters are raiſed they are removed, the exceſs of their heat and their poyſon ſcarce penetrates deeper into the Body, than the bottom of the <hi>Epidermis,</hi> and therfore this remedy may be applyed without any notable harm or danger. But then you may demand what profit can ariſe from hence? We affirm, that it doth effectually correct a cold and moiſt diſtemper, and potently diſſipate the aſtoniſhment of the Marrow of the Back, the Brain, Nervs, and the Nervous parts, and withal that they make all the parts more firm and ſteady, and ſtir up a ſtronger Pulſe in the external parts; al which things are of no ſmal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the cure of this Diſeaſ.</p>
            <p>One amongſt us affirmeth, that among other things he preſcribed this remedy to a Child of two years old who was troubled with the <hi>Rachites,</hi> and was alſo fallen into a continual and malignant Feaver, and grown al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt frantick. Hereupon the Child found preſent and manifeſt eaſ, and after a few days was delivered from his
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:169706:162"/>
Feaver. Afterwards having purged him twice or thrice with an infuſion of <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> &amp;c. Beyond the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all that ſaw it, he alſo ſubdued this <hi>Affect</hi> almoſt without any other remedies. But as you can ſcarce find any commodity without a diſcommodity: ſo neither is this remedy exempted from al inconveniences. For it is unpleaſing, ful of pain and moleſtation to Children: Moreover, for a time it interrupteth their exerciſe and paſtime, in reſpect of which things, unleſs perhaps ſom other complicated <hi>affect</hi> do point at an interdiction of exerciſe, it may do much more prejudice than advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Again, the force of it ſuddenly waſteth, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by degrees is conſumed, which doth not in all reſpects keep touch with a Chronical Diſeaſ. Finally, an Iſſu which is proper to Chronical Diſeaſes, may very wel ſupply its place in this <hi>affect.</hi> Wherfore we ſcarce admit the application of bliſters in the cure of this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady, unleſs ſom acute Diſeaſ be complicated, which may require this kind of Remedy, as it fals out in the Cauſe propounded.</p>
            <p>Now wher this adminiſtration is requiſit, it is moſt commodiouſly performed upon the turning Joynts of the Neck, unleſs ſom Iſſu have prepoſſeſſed the place; in which caſe you muſt adminiſter them either behind the Ears, or four Fingers below the Iſſu. We deny not but it may be fitted to ſeveral other places in reſpect of the complication of other Diſeaſes. But we here deſign the place which a peculiar reference to the preſent Diſeaſ.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Ligatures alſo may be referred to this Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and indeed we grant, that ſomtimes they are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unuſeful in this <hi>affect;</hi> namly, if they be very moderate, and adhibited by juſt diſtances, and unto convenient places; but you muſt beware that they hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not the growth of that part, wherunto they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed;
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:169706:163"/>
which is don if they be ſufficiently looſe, and made of ſoft wool, if in the Day time, or for ſom part of the Day they are tyed up, and unbound at night, if they be fitted to the Thighs and Legs upon the Knee, and to the Arms upon the Elbow.</p>
            <p>Yet Ligatures do here ſeem to conduce much to the ſtoppage of the Blood from flowing to the Head, and that it ought to be faſtned to the outward parts that are extenuated: beſides, this Remedy is good to retard the over ſlippery return of the Blood in thoſe parts, unto which the Ligature is applyed.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Hitherto alſo belong the <hi>Faſciation</hi> or ſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of certain parts, for this hath an affinity with Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatures. For ſom uſe to enwrap the weak parts in wollen blankets, therby to ſtrengthen them, and to cheriſh their heat; namly, the Feet, the Legs, the Knees, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent parts of the Thighs. But you muſt be careful that the overſtraightneſs of them hinder not their growth.</p>
            <p>Others, inſtead of theſe ſwathing bands uſe buttond Boots lined with woollen Cloth; theſ they do not make uſe of only for ſtrength and heat, but alſo to correct the crookedneſs of the Bones, and to erect the bending of the Joynts. Som ad little <hi>Shingles,</hi> or <hi>pieces of Whale-Bone,</hi> but there are three things worthy of obſervation in the making of theſe. 1. That they may ſomwhat cruſh the prominent and convex part of the Bone. 2. That they ſcarce touch the hollow, but rather that they defend it from compreſſion. 3. That they be well fitted to the part, and do as little as poſſible hinder the motion of

            <p>The two Axel trees or Diameters C D upon which the Shingles or Splents are bended F G are faſtned with two rings or hoops. But the hoops themſelves A B C are made of plates of Iron of an exquiſit thinneſs, that they may not be burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and withal they ought to be wel ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and poliſht that they hinder not the motion of the Splents. Theſe rings muſt be of an equal Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,

ſuppoſe about two fingers a croſs, and they muſt be ſo fitted together, that on every ſide they may be paralels; only let there be ſo much diſtance between them, that they may fitly receive the tops of the Splents. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, Thoſe hoops muſt not only be coupled with a double Axel C and D, but alſo with five ſmal Iron Nails. Laſtly, The whol compoſition of the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be ſo made, that it may be faſt and fitly tied to the ſide of the bended knee ſticking out, and withal that it may ſerve as well for the extenſion as the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bending of it, but let it reſtrain the deflexion of it to either ſide, eſpecially to the part ſticking out. Which is the cauſ why the Axels are faſtned with a double Hoop, namely leſt the Joynts ſhould be looſ, and yield to the deflexion of the Knee.</p>
            <p>In like manner the torſion and miſhapen writhing of the Feet is alſo frequently corrected with Swathing Bands. If the Toes are outwardly diſtorted, they muſt every night be bound up, little balls of Cotton being put between the Heels and the Ankles. But if the Toes bend inwards, then you muſt bind the Ankles, and put a little Cotton between the great Toes.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, To ſtraighten the trunk of the Body, or to keep it ſtraight, they uſe to make Breaſtplates of Whale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone put into two woolen Cloaths and Sewed together, which they ſo fit to the Bodies of the Children, that they may keep the Backbone upright, repreſs the ſtic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out of the Bones, and defend the crookedneſs of them from a further compreſſion. But you muſt be careful that they be not troubleſom to the Children that wear them, and therfore the beſt way is to faſten them to the Spine of the Back with a handſom ſtring fitted to that uſe.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXX. Of the Pharmacentical matter, and firſt of ſuch things as clenſe the firſt Paſſages.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His matter is of manifold and moſt noble uſe, and ſatisfieth very many Indications. For it comprehendeth al Medicaments, thoſe only accepted which concern the Chyrurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which have a primary relation either to the cauſes of the Diſeaſ, or the Diſeaſ it ſelf, or the Symptoms.</p>
            <p>It is divided into remedies <hi>Internal</hi> or <hi>External,</hi> and each of them into <hi>Simple</hi> and <hi>Compound.</hi> Again the Internal may be ſubdivided into ſuch <hi>as clenſ the firſt paſſagss,</hi> as <hi>Medicines Preparatory.</hi> Into <hi>Electively e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuant,</hi> and ſuch as are <hi>Specifically alterant</hi> and <hi>Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuant,</hi> and finally into thoſe that <hi>correct the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among theſe the Internal obtain the precedency, and of thoſe again ſuch as waſh away the impurities of the firſt paſſages, becauſ theſe (as hath been already obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) are juſtly accounted an impediment in reſpect of the following remedies, and ſimply ought firſt to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. But in all the Titles (as far as the Nature of the thing will licenſ or warrant us) we will place the Simple before the Compound.</p>
            <p>Moreover, theſe waſhing remedies comprehend theſe three kinds, namely, <hi>Clyſters, Vomits,</hi> and <hi>Lenitive Purgations.</hi>

               <head>The uſe of Clyſters, and ſome forms of them.</head>
               <p>The Injection of Clyſter-pipes, before we more exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly and earneſtly attempt the Cure, is then chiefly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>required, when the Belly is coſtive, and the Excrements are hardned; or when ſome windy humors torment the Guts, or ſome vehement pain in the Bowels afflict the Patient. In which caſes they may not only be injected before any preparation, but alſo before a Vomit, yea or a Lenitive Purgation. Theſe are frequently compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of benign and gentle Purgers, ſomtimes alſo of ſuch as have only a faculty to make the waies ſlippery, and to expel wind, but never of Cathartical ingredients that are violent they are to be injected warm or lukewarm, and after a long abſtinence from meat. We ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſome forms.</p>
               <p>Take Cows new-Milk, warmed, four or five oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; Anis Seeds beaten to Pouder ten grains; Courſ Sugar, one ounce, one ounce and an half, <hi>or</hi> two ounces; The Yolk of one Egg: <hi>mingle them and make a Clyſter; to theſe may be added</hi> half an ounce of new Butter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take a ſufficient quantity of an emollient Decoction.</hi> An Electuary lenitive half an ounce; Syrup of Roſes So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutive, and Syrup of Violets, of each ſix drachms; Oyl of Chamomel one ounce; mingle them, make your Clyſter and let it be injected lukewarm.</p>
               <p>Take the Roots of Marſh Mallows beaten together, half an ounce, <hi>or in lieu therof,</hi> the leaves or Flowers of Mallows half a handful; Flowers of Chamomel one pugil; Hemp Seeds two drachms: <hi>boyl them in a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient quantity of</hi> Whey mingled with Beer: To four or five ounces of the Decoction <hi>ad of</hi> Diacaſſia, <hi>or</hi> Electua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium Paſſulatum half an ounce, Syrup of Roſes Solutive,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:169706:166"/>
                  <hi>and</hi> Kitchin Sugar, of each one ounce; new Butter ſix drachms, <hi>you may if you ſee occaſion ad</hi> the yolk of one Egg.</p>
               <p>Take Stone-Horſdung that is new, one ounce and an half; The Seeds of Annis, Fennel, Mallows, beaten to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, of each one drachm and an half; Flowers of Chamomel one pugil. <hi>Boyl them in a ſufficient quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of poſſet drink: In four or five ounces</hi> of the Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>diſſolve ten drachms</hi> of Syrup of Violets, common Sugar, and Oyl of Roſes, of each half an ounce: <hi>Mingle them and make your Clyſter.</hi>

            <div type="part">
               <head>The uſe of vomiting remedies, and ſome examples of them.</head>
               <p>Emedical Remedies or Vomits, do chiefly perform three things. Firſt they evacuate crude or corrupt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and all manner of impurities contained in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and that by a ſhorter and more expedite way, than if they were conveyed through the involutions and labyrinths of the Guts. Secondly, By an agitation and commotion raiſed in all the parts, eſpecially the Bowels, they looſen the groſs and viſcous humors adhering unto them, or impacted in them, and frequently expel them, eſpecially thoſe which are collected in the Stomach and Guts; in which reſpect they are profitable againſt tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Chollick and very conducible to unlock Obſtructions. Thirdly, They moſt effectually irritate the expulſive faculty of all the parts of the Body, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially of the Bowels, and by this means many times upon a ſingle application they compel forth the hidden and unappearing cauſes and fomentations of Diſeaſes, and eſpecially of intermitting Feavers. For by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtraining to vomit, the Guts are alſo inſtimulated to
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:169706:166"/>
caſt out by ſiege. The Liver powreth away the Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler by the Biliary Pore; the ſweet-Bread voideth his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar excrement by the new Veſſel into the Guts; the Spleen alſo perhaps unburdens in a plentiful manner his excrement into the Stomach by Veſſels not yet through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known: The Kidneys exern through the <hi>Ureters,</hi> the Lungs by a ſtrong Cough eject their Flegm through the Windpipe: The Brain emptieth it ſelf of ſalt, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſh Rhewms, and matter by the Palate, the Noſtrils and the Eyes. Finally the whol Body for the moſt part is rendred more prone to a <hi>Diaphoreſis</hi> either by a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt ſweating, or elſe by an occult and inſenſible Tranſpiration. In the mean time it muſt be noted that not all gentle Vomits, nor indeed the more vehement, if they be given in too ſmal a doſe wil preſently and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perform all theſe things, yet in their operations they effect more or leſs according to the ſtrength or quantity of the Medicine, and indeed if the ſtronger be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in a full doſe they effectually attain to the three marks propounded.</p>
               <p>It is obvious, by what hath been ſaid, to the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of any Reader, that ſtrong Vomits preſcribed in a full quantity are not competible to Children affected with this Diſeaſ, neither can their tender ſtrength o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome and ſubdue ſo great tumults in the Body, and ſuch an Univerſal evacuation ſo ſuddenly wrought, Wherfore this kind of remedy ought not to be preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to Children without diligent precaution and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection, and both the ſtrength, quantity, and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the Medicine are duly to be prepondred. To this end therfore we ſhall ſet down ſome Cautious in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of unexperienced Practicers.</p>
               <p>Firſt, A Vomit is not to be provoked in this Diſeaſ, unleſs the humors tend upwards of their own accord, but
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:169706:167"/>
then indeed they may be expelled by vomiting remedies without difficulty.</p>
               <p>Seeondly, Not unleſs Children are naturally or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomarily apt to vomit, and do eaſily endure it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In Bloud-ſpitting, the Ptiſick and Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, in any flowing of Bloud at the Noſe, or any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal opening of the Veins, and the like caſes, abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence muſt he enjoyned from this remedy.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Vehement vomits exhibited in a larger doſe are here forbidden. For the fear is juſt and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that they may depopulate the Natural Spirits, and further conſume the very ſolid parts which before were over-much extenuated.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſary therfore that the Vomits here preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, be either in their own nature gentle, or corrected if they be vehement and adminiſtred in a leſſened doſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You wil ſay,</hi> If they be of a mild and lenitive facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or exhibited in a diminute quantity, they cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the humors with any efficacy.</p>
               <p>To this we anſwer, Indeed where Nature contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth little or no aſſiſtance, it cannot be denied; but in ſuch caſes we totally prohibit the adminiſtration of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting remedies; but preſuppoſing both a fitneſs of the Body and Humors to this evacuation (as is required in the firſt and ſecond Caution) even gentle vomits may expel ſuch humors as are ſeated in the firſt paſſages. The thing muſt be ſaid of the ſtrong being prudently corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and ſparingly applied. For by reaſon of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and diminute quantity they do not much ſhake and diſcompoſe the Body, or provoke Nature; and again, through the proclivity of the Stomach and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors they are ſufficient to reward this Scope with a lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable ſucceſs. We will now ſubjoyn ſome few Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</p>

               <p>Theſe Evacuant Medicines produce their Effects without tumult, and therfore they requir not ſo great circumſpection as Vomiting Compoſitions, or ſuch as are electively Purgant. Yet three things muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the Uſe of them. 1. That they do not nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiat the Ventricle with ſuch an ingrateful taſt and favor as may render an abhorrence from all future Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. 2. That they oppreſs not the Stomach by an immoderat quantity. 3. That the potion drunk be not preſently vomited up. To prevent this laſt danger it will be a good way preſently to bedew and moiſten the

            <head>CHAP. XXXI. Remedies Preparatory, and their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe Remedies partly relate to the preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Humors, partly to the waies tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row which they are to be expelled, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the paſſages themſelvs, wherin they are contained. Now it muſt be known, That the Evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation which is perfected by Vomits, doth leaſt of any pre-requir any preparation; but that which is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed by <hi>Catharticks</hi> or Medicins Purging, doth moſt of all exact it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Humors in general to be prepared are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Flegmatick, namly cold, which muſt be qualified and tempered with hot, thick, and muſt be attenuated; viſcous, and muſt be cut and opened; or Cholerick, namly ſharp, bitter, burning, corroſive, which are to be mitigated with lenifying and aſwaging Medicins; or Melancholly, namly earthy, feculent, tartarous, which by a benignity of application muſt be rendred fluxible; or laſtly ſerous and wateriſh, which muſt be diſpoſed and as it were manuducted either to the Urinary paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as by piſſing, or to the Belly as by ſiege, or to the parts near the Skin that they may with the more facility evaporate by Sweating.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The waies, thorow which the Evacuation muſt be effected, ought alſo to be made fit and prepared,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:169706:169"/>
and not only the common, but alſo the ſpecial, by which the <hi>peccant</hi> matter in particular is conveyed to thoſe common Channels. For there is one preparation of the Veſſels of the Kidnies (which is chiefly expedited by Medicins of a ſlippery and looſning faculty) another of the Veſſels of the Liver, which is don by opening, clenſing, and ſomewhat aſtringent Medicaments: A third of the Veſſels of the Lungs, which is moſt ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully wrought by Lenient and Maturant Remedies, ſomtimes perhaps according to the nature of the matter Medicins incident or atenuant being adminiſtred, or on the contrary, Adminiſtrations making thick, and ſuch as have a vertue to arreſt and avert the flux.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Thoſe parts wherein the vicious humors principally flow or are lodged, require the admixture of Medicaments peculiarly apropriated unto them. And as this or that part is more or leſs affected, ſomtimes choice muſt be made of <hi>Cephalicals,</hi> ſomtimes <hi>Hepati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals,</hi> and ſomtimes <hi>Pectoral</hi> Preparations.</p>
            <p>Moreover, (that we may comprehend together moſt if not all of the qualities of Preparatory Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies required in this Affect) we ſay, That theſe Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies preſcribed by Art ought to be moderatly hot (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there be a Feaver preſent) alſo attenuant, incident and opening; in like manner, that by a peculiar right they muſt have reſpect to the Liver, the Lungs and the Head, which parts for the moſt part are commonly in this Affect oppreſſed with a plenitude of humors: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, That there are ſome things ſpecifically apropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this Affect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if ſuch things are not in Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which are regeſtred in the number of things prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory, and dedicated to the Diſeaſ, than at leaſt other ſpecificals ought to be mingled with the Preparatory Medicines.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="332" facs="tcp:169706:170"/>
Theſe things being premiſed, we judged it expedient to ſet down ſuch Simple and Compound Medicines as are uſually ſold in the Shops, and alſo ſome examples of decompounded Preparatory Remedies. Yet we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the expectation of all Simples, or perhaps of any one, that ſhould comprehend all the qualities, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven now we attributed to thoſe exquiſite and apropriate Remedies; for then there would be no need of any Compoſition, and we ſhall reckon up ſuch and ſo many that a prudent Phyſitian may ſelect and contemper them among themſelves, which being diſcreetly intermingled they may be correſpondent to all the fore recited quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He matter of the Diſeaſ being prepared, and the paſſages opened to facilitate the evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the next thing is, To conſider what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies wil electively expel the peccant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors in particular. Now theſe Medicines do partly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the humors, and partly the parts wherein they are lodged; but in each of them a du regard muſt be had to the Spirits.</p>
            <p>The violent muſt be either totally prohibited, or elſe exhibited after a du correction or a circumſpect diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the doſe; and for yonger Children, and ſuch as are weak, they muſt be the leſs in quantity, and the more gentle in quality; for great and luſty Children you may prepare ſtronger remedies and in a larger doſe (provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that they exceed not the ſtrength of the Child. In both cauſes it is ſafer to favor and go leſs then the ſtrength wil bear, than to tranſcend it in the leaſt degree: and in this affect it is altogether better to proceed by an <hi>Epichraſis,</hi> then together and at once to attempt the ful evacuation of the peccant humors.</p>
            <p>Moreover the predominant humors in the Body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire proper and peculiar remedies; as Choler, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines purging Choler: Flegm, Medicines purging flegm: Melancholy Medicines purging Melancholy: and wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh humors ſuch as purge water.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:169706:172"/>
Again, If the Liver be oppreſſed with humors more than the other parts, ſuch <hi>Catharticks</hi> muſt be choſen as peculiarly belong to the Liver. In like manner the Lungs being vehemently infeſted, or the Brain, and the other parts, ſuch remedies muſt be choſen as are appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to thoſe parts. But if there be not a ready ſupply of purging Simples peculiarly dedicated to thoſe parts, that defect muſt be made good by a prudent commixture of ſuch ingredients as are familiar to thoſe parts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly, You muſt endeavor (as much as poſſibly you can) to make choice of ſuch purgers as are directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the Eſſence of the Diſeaſ. In this reſpect we commend</hi> Rhubarb <hi>above al other ſimples. For it is</hi> a Medicament moderatly hot and dry, very familiar to the inherent <hi>Spirits</hi> of all the parts, it gently diſpelleth the ſtupefaction of the parts, and ſtrengthneth the ſoftneſs &amp; looſneſs of the parts, ſomwhat correcteth the internal ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perineſs, ſummons the Pulſ to the Arteries, and encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the heat of the outward parts, and finally it cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the vigor and activity of the inner parts, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of thoſe which are ſubſervient to nouriſhment. <hi>Ad in a word,</hi> That it exceeding rarely <hi>(provided that you give it in a juſt doſe)</hi> cauſeth ſuperpurgation, for it is a Medicament ſafe for all ages, and every Complexion.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being premiſed, we ſhal propound ſom ſimple purgative Medicines, and ſom examples of the Compound. For nothing hindreth, but that many of the prerecited lenitives, may be commodiouſly refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hither, though in a different reſpect.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He cauſes of the Diſeaſ being now prepared and in part evacuated, or at leaſt ſo ſubdued, that for the preſent they cannot retard the cure, you muſt proceed to theſe Medicines <hi>specifically alterant,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> as it were fly at the very throat of the Diſeaſ, and in regard wherof the premiſed Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines both preparatory and evacuant took place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now theſe ſpecificals may be defined to be,</hi> Remedies diametrically contrary to the Nature of the Diſeaſ, and ſuch as directly impugn it.</p>
            <p>Theſe are either Simple or Compound, the Simple which hitherto we have had knowledg of, are theſe that
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:169706:174"/>
follow: the root of <hi>Oſmund</hi> the <hi>Royal,</hi> or rather the <hi>ſpike</hi> of the root, the middle being thrown away, the root of the male <hi>Fernbrake, or rather,</hi> the little buds before their peeping forth out of the earth; the roots of <hi>Graſs, Succhory, Asparagus, Madder, Eringo,</hi> all the <hi>Maiden hairs, Ceterach, Harts tongue, Liverwort, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony,</hi> the flowers and leavs of <hi>dead Nettles, Borage, ſage Roſemary, Tamarisk, Southernwood, Pontik Wormwood, The</hi> greater <hi>Sulendine, Saffron, Turmerick,</hi> the roots of <hi>Sarſaperilla, Salſaphras, China,</hi> the three ſorts of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> the wood of <hi>Guiacum,</hi> and its <hi>Bark, flowr of brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, ſteel prepared, Crocus Martis, ſalt of ſteel, wine ſteelified, ſyrup of ſteel, white and Rhenniſh wine Sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Ceti, Musk, Ambergreece, Caſtoreum, Earthworms,</hi> the Livers of <hi>Frogs</hi> and yong <hi>Ravens, Woodlice,</hi> waſht in white Wine, bak'd inan Oven, and beaten to powder, and ſuch like things.</p>
            <p>But if any demand, <hi>After what manner, or by what action theſe Medicaments do especially over-rule the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of this affect?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We anſwer,</hi> That perhaps it is not neceſſary, that we preſently fly to occult qualities, which for the moſt part is but the Sanctuary and refuge of ignorance: but that the primary and ſecondary parts of the Eſſence of this Diſeaſ above deſcribed ought to be reduced to Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: for by making a compariſon between thoſe parts, and theſe Medicaments, we ſhal plainly diſcern an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure contrariety and repugnance between them. For this Diſeaſ conſiſteth in a cold and moiſt diſtemper inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the Spirits together with want and aſtoniſhment of the Spirit and weakneſs of the parts afflicted: on the contrary theſe remedies heat and dry, cheriſh the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Spirits, diſſipate that numbneſs which is in them and ſtrengthen the parts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="342" facs="tcp:169706:175"/>
Moreover, In regard that theſe remedies with their heat and drineſs obtain withal a manifeſt friability and thinneſs of parts, it comes to paſs, that they cut through all viſcous matter, they attenuate all groſs and thick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and procure a certain equality of all the juyces that have their circulation in the Sanguinary Maſs, and an even diſtribution (conſideration being had of the diſtance from the fountain of heat) both of heat and Blood. Herupon the external parts which before were lean enjoy a more liberal heat and nouriſhment, and the <hi>Parenchimata</hi> of the Bowels which were irregularly encreaſed, are delivered from thick and viſcous alimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary juyces, and therupon are ſomwhat leſned: by this means that <hi>Alogotrophy</hi> or irrational Nouriſhment of the parts, from whence ſo great a ſeries of organical faults reſulteth, is corrected. Finally, Theſe remedies do alſo ſtrengthen and cheriſh the ſinewy parts, and likewiſe the extream weakneſs of the Bone of the Back.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, That all the Simples above recited by us, do not fully perform all theſe things. For the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral kinds of Sanders, though they may by their drineſs, friability and thinneſs of parts ſtrongly impugn this Diſeaſ, yet by their coldneſs they ſeem rather to come neer to the parts of the Diſeaſ; we ſay therfore that Simples of this Nature ought not to be given alone, but being commixt with ſome other, which may prevalent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly correct the noxious quality; in like manner ſome Simples extreamly hot, as <hi>Saffron, Caſtoreum, Flowr of Brimſtone,</hi> &amp;c. are very repugnant to this Diſeaſ, yet you muſt refrain the adminiſtration of them unleſs they be duly attempered. Moreover <hi>Sarſaparilla, Saſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phras, Osmund the royal,</hi> the kinds of <hi>Fernbrake,</hi> all the <hi>Maiden-hairs, Hartſtongue, Ceterach,</hi> and the like,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:169706:175"/>
their heat and drineſs being conjoyned with a notable friability and thinneſs of the parts they contribute very much to the equal diſtribution of the Blood, as alſo to ſubdue many other parts of the Diſeaſ. But they ſcarce lend a ſufficient ſtrength to the ſinewy and fibrous parts; wherfore they ſeem to crave an admixture of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalical Remedies. Again, <hi>Lignum Vitae,</hi> by its heat, drineſs and friability, and by its Balſamical and Roſiniſh ſubſtance, doth very much ſtrengthen the <hi>Tone</hi> of the parts, and is contrariant to ſome other parts of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſ; yet becauſ it helps very little the contemperation of the Juyces contained in the Sanguinary Maſs, but on the contrary is rather an hindrance therunto, it ought not without great caution to be preſcribed, and that in a ſmall quantity and well corrected. Laſtly, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Simples here recited, ſome are received to ſtrengthen all the Spirits rather than to ſubdue the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Diſeaſ, as Sage, Musk, Ambergreeſ, and the like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which come not into uſe but when they are mingled with other effectual and more apropriate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If any ſhall further demand,</hi> Which among all theſe propounded Simples are to be valued as the moſt noble and effectual; <hi>we comprehend our Anſwer in theſe Rules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, They are the moſt noble Medicines, which joyntly make the ſtrongeſt oppoſition againſt moſt parts of the Eſſence of the Diſeaſ.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Thoſe <hi>Caeteris paribus,</hi> are to be eſteemed the more noble, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> directly affront the Eſſence of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſ, eſpecially if at the ſame time they advance the equal diſtribution of the Blood and Vital Spirit, wherby ſo many organical faults are corrected.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Such things as oppoſe the Diſeaſ moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently by an eſſential contrariety, provided they be
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:169706:176"/>
not as well too ſtrong for Nature as the Diſeaſ.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Thoſe which are both repugnant to the Diſeaſ, and yet withal, grateful to Nature, in no wiſe offering any violence to her.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Thoſe w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are moſt grateful &amp; pleaſing to the ſick Child, &amp; ſuch as adminiſtred trouble not its Pallate.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being premiſed we ſhall now ſubjoyn ſome examples of compound Medicines.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXXIV. Remedies that correct the Symptoms.</head>
            <p>SOme Symptoms ſupervening upon this Affect, do ſomtimes anticipate the legitamat Method of Cure, and require a particular manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. Of this ſort are the flux of the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Lask, wherwith ſomwhat of a Lientery is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently joyned; profuſe Sweats, laborious and painful breeding Teeth, and the Toothach.</p>
            <p>The flux of the Belly doth very much follow this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; which if it perſevere for any long time, it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very violent, and eaſily watereth the Spirits, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth the ſolid parts, manifeſtly puts on the nature of a cauſ, and as a cauſ indicates its own correction. A Bloody-flux rarely hapneth with this Diſeaſ. But a Lask with exulcerations in the Guts, or complicated with a Lientery is very uſeful. For in reſpect of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to the parts ſubſervient to digeſtion, a <hi>Lask,</hi> or a <hi>Lyentery</hi> may eaſily ſupervene, but not a <hi>Bloudy-flux.</hi> Yet there is a frequent concurrence of other cauſes; as of the indigeſted nouriſhment vicious either in quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or quality; ſom feaver, watchings, worms, painful breeding Teeth, &amp;c. al which things do likewiſe eaſily occaſion a <hi>Lask,</hi> or <hi>Lyentery</hi> rather than a <hi>Bloudy-flux.</hi> As for the Cure, it is partly perfected by Purgations, partly by aſtringent Remedies; partly by ſuch as open, and partly by ſuch as ſtrengthen the parts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="350" facs="tcp:169706:179"/>
Theſe Purgers are moſt proper which leave behind an evident binding after evacuation; as <hi>Rhubarb, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Tamarinds, Myrobalans,</hi> &amp;c. out of which for the moſt part we frame a <hi>Bolus</hi> or Potions, becauſ they are moſt eaſily ſwallowed under thoſe forms. As,</p>
            <p>Take <hi>Conſerv of Red Roſes</hi> half an ounce; <hi>Rhubarb in Pouder</hi> twelve grains; with a ſufficient quantity of <hi>ſyrup of Coral</hi> make a <hi>Bolus</hi> to be given in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>Take <hi>of the Pulp of Tamarinds</hi> one dram; <hi>Rhubarb in Pouder</hi> ſeven grains; <hi>Sugar of Roſes</hi> half a dram, with a ſufficient quantity of <hi>ſyrup of Quinces,</hi> make your <hi>Bolus.</hi> Inſtead of this Syrup you may uſe <hi>ſyrup of Coral,</hi> or <hi>ſyrup of Mint,</hi> or <hi>ſyrup of Myrtles,</hi> or <hi>ſyrup of Pomgranats.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take <hi>Senna</hi> half a dram; <hi>Rhubarb</hi> one ſcruple; <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marinds</hi> a dram and an half; <hi>Anniſeeds bruiſed</hi> ten grains: Infuſe them in a ſufficient quantity of <hi>fountain water:</hi> boyl them very gently: and to an ounce and an half of <hi>the Decoction,</hi> ad <hi>ſyrup of dried Roſes</hi> half an ounce: mingle them together for a Potion.</p>
            <p>Take <hi>Plantan</hi> or <hi>Succory water,</hi> or <hi>Saxifrage water,</hi> one ounce; <hi>Rhubarb in pouder</hi> ten grains; <hi>ſyrup. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtan. ſyrup of dried Roſes</hi> of each two drams: Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle them and make your Potion.</p>
            <p>It muſt be obſerved, That a more full evacuation is ſomtimes requiſit, namly, when the flux hath not been immoderat, or of long continuance, and in the mean time the matter offending hath bin copiouſly collected in the Body. In which caſe, in lieu of the Syrup of <hi>dried Roſes,</hi> you may take ſom drams of <hi>ſyrup of Roſes ſolutive, ſyr. Auguſtan.</hi> or of <hi>Succory with Rhubarb</hi> or <hi>Manna:</hi> But commonly the ſafeſt way is, to augment the doſe of <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> or elſ of <hi>Senna,</hi> not omitting the <hi>ſyrup of dried Roſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:169706:179"/>
In the evening after the Purgation, you may admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ten grains of <hi>Diaſcordium</hi> boyled in <hi>Wine,</hi> with <hi>Cloves,</hi> and a little <hi>Cinnamon,</hi> and mixed with a third part of <hi>Erratick Poppy water,</hi> and ſome cordial Syrups, as Syrup of Clove-Gilliflowers to ſtrengthen the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and to ſtay the Flux; or if the Flux be ſtubborn, you may mingle two drams of <hi>Diacodium</hi> for a doſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Syrup aforeſaid. Or</p>
            <p>Take of Poſſet-drink made with white-Wine, the Curd being taken off (aromatize it with a little <hi>Saffron</hi> tied up in a rag, cruſhing it gently between your Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers) <hi>Confectio Alkermes</hi> one ſcruple; Pomgranat Pils in pouder ſeven grains; <hi>Diacodium</hi> two drams: mix them together to be taken when the Child is minded to ſleep. Or</p>
            <p>Take <hi>Laudanum</hi> according to the <hi>London Diſpenſato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> half a grain; <hi>Magiſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> of Coral twelve grains; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of Clove-Gilliflowers, or Red Roſes, one ſcruple, with a ſufficient quantity of Syrup of Quinces, make a <hi>Bolus</hi> to be taken at bed-time.</p>
            <p>If there be obſtructions, you may preſcribe <hi>Crocus M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rtis,</hi> or Salt of Steel, to be taken in the morning. As,</p>
            <p>Take Conſerve of Roſes one ounce: the Roots of Succory preſerved, Myrobalans preſerved in <hi>India,</hi> of each half an ounce: Salt of Steel half a ſcruple, or <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> one ſcruple: Cinnamon, Liquoris, red Coral, of each eighteen grains: Saffron a grain and a half: Syrup of Succory without Rhubarb a ſufficient quantity: make your Electuary according to art, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of let the Child take half a dram each morning. Red hot Iron may be quenched to the ſame purpoſe in its ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary drink.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="352" facs="tcp:169706:180"/>
If the Child be troubled with a violent flux, you may give it ſom binding Conſerves, imagin Conſerve of Sloes, and mix it with ſuch things as the Child delights to eat, but in ſo doing be ſure you pleaſ its Palat.</p>
            <p>Somtimes a profuſe and exceſſive ſweating find a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar buſineſs for the Phyſitian in this affect: for it very much waſts the Spirits and retards the cure of the diſeaſ.</p>
            <p>Yet caution muſt be uſed not to reſtrain it raſhly, if perhaps there be a Feaver, or if any feaveriſh fit, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderat heat hath gon before: For in theſe caſes it may be upon a critical time, or at leaſt it may bring more advantage to the Body by the mitigation of the Feaver, than damage by the loſs of the Spirits. For we know not whether any thing doth more potently or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed more ſweetly expel the feaveriſh heat tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſweating.</p>
            <p>In the interim when it floweth inordinately and cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, it argueth that the Body is oppreſſed with obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, with crude juyces and unprofitable ſuperfluities, which whilſt Nature ſtriveth to maſter, and to ſubdu, by that very labor, (the openneſs of the pores withal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring) it is evaporated by ſweat, and indeed an unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable one, very laborious and ſuch as waſteth the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which therfore as ſoon as poſſible muſt be corrected This <hi>Hippocrates</hi> meant, where he adviſeth, <hi>That that ſweat which floweth away without cauſe, requireth pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</hi> For what can more commodiouſly diminiſh and diſſipate theſe ſuperfluities? Again, this motion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to ſweating, wherfore it meriteth the preheminence among the remedies oppoſed to this Sympton, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it clears the way for Medicines aperient, and ſuch as ſtrengthen the skin, and move forward conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, (which perfect the laſt part of the cure) it ought in al right to be premiſed before them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="353" facs="tcp:169706:180"/>
Purgative Medicines hitherto belonging, are thoſe that are obſerved to be friendly, and agreable to Nature, and withal ſuch as open obſtructions, and ſtrengthen the Bowels: al which things whither any Simple can perform ſo wel as Rubarb, we very much doubt. Yet al thoſe Simpl and Compound Medicaments propoſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove in the Chapter of Remedies Electively evacuant, may, according to the Condition of the Patient, and the Prudence of the Phyſitian, be tranſplanted hither. Som very much commend Beer in this caſe medicated with Rubarb.</p>
            <p>Take Rubarb cut into any ſmal peeces, two Drams; Raiſins ſtoned and ſlit, one ounce; ſmal Bear, two pound; put them into a Glaſs or ſtone flagon ſtopt with the beſt Cork; ſet it in a very cold place, and ſtir it very often, but before you uſe it let it ſettle again, a whol day, then draw out the liquor for your ordinary drink. When the flagon is empty fil it again with beer but put not in a new quantity of Rhubarb.</p>
            <p>Moreover, The moſt noble Aperients which both help concoction, and repreſs unprofitable ſweating, are <hi>French Wine,</hi> and <hi>Rhenniſh Wine.</hi> But if there be any fear of their heat in this tender age, they may be tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with roſted Apples, Borage, or red Roſe-water, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a little Sugar and grated Nutmeg, let them be alſo taken in a leſſer quantity and only at meals.</p>
            <p>They are likewiſe the moſt effectual Aperients, which do not only help concoction, but alſo ſtrengthen the <hi>Tone</hi> of al the parts, eſpecially of the Bowels. Among which we chiefly commend things made with ſteel, as wine made with ſteel, and the Electuary before named, and the like. Now although ſteel doth indeed effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perform thoſe things which we have ſaid; yet becauſe it doth not in all reſpects anſwer to ſom other ſcopes of
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:169706:181"/>
great moment in this affect, but doth more hurt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in one particular, than it doth good in another; we thought it expedient to ſubjoyn theſe following Cautions concerning the uſe therof.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Seing that Steel is an enemy to the Lungs, and doth eaſily ſtir a cruel flux of flegmatick matter in ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Bodies, therfore you muſt totally abſtain from the uſe therof, where there is any Cathar, Cough, obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Lungs, and much more, if there be any Inflamation, Pleuriſie, Blood-ſpitting, or a proneſs of diſpoſition to any of theſe affects.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſ Steel contributes little or nothing to the operation of the Blood: but on the contrary (however it may attenuat the tough and flegmatick part thereof) doth rather expedit the ſeparation therof from the other maſs of Blood by reaſon of the tart quality that is predominent in it, it cannot be admitted but with circumſpection, eſpecially that inequality of the Blood being ſo importunat and urgent.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Seing that the attenuating, cutting and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening faculty in Steel is conjoyned with an apparent and extream drineſs and binding, and therfore perhaps doth more compact thoſe humors, than diſſolve and ſcatter them; the uſe therof ought to be refrained, at leaſt ſuſpected in any conſiderable <hi>Alogotrophy</hi> of the parts. For the fear is leſt it ſhould bind too cloſe and conſolidate the ſhort parts of the Bones &amp; thoſe that are too ſcantily nouriſhed; wherby afterwards they may becom leſs prompt and apt to grow in length: but the parts ſticking out (as alſo the convex ſides of the Bones) which are liberally nouriſhed it cannot diſſolve, and then there may be a jealouſie that it will too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them and make them ſtubborn; namly by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream thickning and hardning of them.</p>
            <p>

Fourthly, In all acute Feavers the uſe of Steel is hurtful, becauſe it over-dryeth and bindeth the Parts, yea, for that very regard that it reſtraineth Sweating, and makes the humors more fierce and ſharp.</p>
            <p>Theſe Cautions being rightly obſerved, we admit the uſe of Steel in this Affect, but becauſ Mountebanks and Quacks cannot diſtinguiſh between the uſe and the abuſe, we would not perſwade any to make tryal of this noble Medicine without the adviſe and counſel of ſome prudent and knowing Phyſitian, becauſ if it be not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly adminiſtred, the danger is very great. Some other Aperients of leſs note may ſerve this ſcope; as the Roots of Succhory or Borrage, or Conſerve of their Flowers; the Roots of Graſs, Sparagus, Fernbrake, Madder; the Leaves of Ceterach, Spleenwort, Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denhair, &amp;c. Among the Compounds Species, <hi>Diatr. ſantal. Diarrhod. abbat.</hi> &amp;c. Or</p>
            <p>Take of the beſt Sugar three ounces, diſſolve it in Roſe Water and boyl it a little beyond the conſiſtence of a Syrup, then ad Conſerv of Barberies one ounce; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atri. Santal. and Diarrhod. Abbat. of each one dram; pouder of Saffron, one grain; mingle them and make your Electuary.</p>
            <p>The painful breeding and the aching of the Teeth are the familiar Symptoms of the Rachites; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſ they breed Feavers, unquietneſs, watchings, and other evils, they alſo deſerve a peculiar mitigation; if the Tooth therfore as it is working through the Gum puts the Child to very much pain, you muſt without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay (unleſs it were done before) appoint ſome univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal evacuation: as a Vomit, which is thought to be a potent remedy againſt the Toothach. Now that may be moved by the only tickling of the Throat, putting
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:169706:182"/>
in a Feather, or the Nurſes Finger into the Childs mouth; or elſe with rubbing the Tooth that is breaking forth with a Tobacco Leaf wrapped about the Nurſes Finger, and a little moiſtned with Beer; or laſtly, by giving ſome vomiting draught above deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. But this remedy is forbidden reiteration in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that it too much may weaken the Stomach. The day following (the pain perſiſting or returning) ſome Cathartick Potion or Bolus among thoſe above reher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or like unto thoſe muſt be adminiſtred. After this univerſal Evacuation you muſt deſcend to Topical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midies. Nurſes are wont to rub the Gums with Corral poliſhed for that purpoſe. But the Phyſitians do rather commend the Root of Marſh Mallows, which do mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie and looſen the Gums that they may obtain the more eaſie paſſage. Others report it for a great ſecret to rub the aching Tooth with the Root of the ſharpeſt Sorrel. Others very much commend the rubbing of that Gum where the Tooth is coming out with a Cocks Comb newley cut off, or with the hot Blood diſtilling from that Wound. We have had no experience of thoſe things which they uſe to inſtill into the Ears; in like manner, neither the Plaiſters of Maſtich, Olibanum, or red Lead, which in thoſe of full growth are obſerved to ſtop the Rhewm. Others apply ſmall Epiſpaſtick Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters behind the Ears, which perhaps compel back the matter that breeds the pain in the Teeth. But neither do we interpoſe our judgment concerning theſe things. Only when Univerſals are unavailable, we have recourſ to Hypnotical Remedies, which indeed by outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication profit little, but being taken inwards they are very helpful, eſpecially being rightly prepared and duly corrected. Therfore when want of reſt and watchings beget moleſtation, thus we proceed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="357" facs="tcp:169706:182"/>
Take Diaſcordium ſeven grains; <hi>Syr. de Meconio,</hi> one dram and an half, or two drams; Poſſet Drink made of Milk and white Wine, with a little Saffron, one ounce, or ten drams; mingle them and give it at Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the next night following after the Purgation.</p>
            <p>Take Ladanum, according to the London Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, half a grain; the Cordial Pouder of the Claws of Crabs ten grains; Conſerve of Clove-gilliflowers one ſcruple; with a ſufficient quantity of Syrup of Balm make a Bolus to be ſwallowed in the evening at ſleeping time. Thus much of ſuch things as correct the Symptoms.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXXV. External Remedies.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving finiſhed the Diſquiſition of the matter and kinds of internal Remedies, we ſhall now direct our Diſcourſ to external Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Which indeed we have reſerved for the laſt place, not becauſ they muſt perpetually be laſt put in execution, but becauſ they are altogether of a different kind from the internal: now Univerſals are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred immediately after Evacuants, or at leaſt after thoſe that are electively Purgant, and withal with the Specifical Alterants, unto which kind they belong, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though indeed as they are external, they differ from them. Now we deſire that we may here be underſtood by external Remedies to ſignifie and intend every kind
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:169706:183"/>
of <hi>Medicament</hi> which cannot properly be referred to <hi>Chyrurgery,</hi> or thoſe things that are inwardly taken, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that they have their uſe in the Cure of this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
            <p>Therfore we divide it into two Kinds, namely, The <hi>manner of Exerciſe,</hi> and <hi>things externally Applicable.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Manner, <hi>or</hi> Kinds of Exerciſe.</head>
               <p>All kinds of Exerciſe, unto which Children are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed, may be uſeful in their time and ſeaſon. But becauſ Children who are moleſted with the <hi>Rachites</hi> are ſomwhat averſ from motion and by reaſon of their weakneſs of Spirit, and unaccuſtomedneſs of Exerciſe do ſcarce after the beginning of the cure, or indeed not at all endure violent motions; therfore they muſt begin perpetually with gentle Exerciſes, and afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by degrees to ſtronger; in like manner at firſt they muſt continue but a ſhort time, but afterwards a longer ſpace without any intermiſſion.</p>
               <p>We therfore diſtinguiſh Exerciſes into gentle, and vehement or Maſculine. The gentle we refer firſt to the manner of lying down. Secondly, To the agitation of the Body in the Cradle. Thirdly, To the carrying them about in the Nurſes Arms. Fourthly, To ſeden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary paſtimes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Lying upon the Back among all the poſtures of the Body doth chiefly recede from Exerciſe, and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt only allowable in the extream weakneſs of the Spirits, as in accute Feavers when the Spirits are ſpent, likewiſe in many caſes of the Cheſt and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriacal parts, as frequently in an inflamation of the Liver, Spleen, Lungues, in a Pleuriſie, in the growing of the Lungues with the Pleura, and an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthume, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="359" facs="tcp:169706:183"/>
The lying upon one ſide either right or left cometh neereſt to the Supine Poſition, and participates very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the Nature of Exerciſe. Wherfore it is alſo allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wable in any great weakneſs of the Spirits, at leaſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of altering the poſture of the Body, as alſo when a profound ſleep is not expected. Moreover, it is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what profitable to ſtrong Bodies in the time of the firſt or ſecond ſleep, after juſt internals ſtill changing ſides. But afterwards perhaps it is not ſo agreable unto, nor beneficial for them, eſpecially when the Body is fully refreſhed with ſleep. For then that poſture is beſt which draweth neereſt to the Nature of Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe.</p>
               <p>The Simple Lateral Poſition containeth ſomwhat more of Exerciſe, and is inconvenient for weak Bodies and ſuch as are not uſed to it in the time of profound ſleep: but otherwiſe it may be made familiar, if for a while they will accuſtom themſelvs unto it. It is at all times good for ſtrong Bodies, provided that a due care be had to alter and vary it.</p>
               <p>The lying on one ſide towards the Belly is laborious and troubleſom, and not to be continued long by ſtrong and robuſtious Bodies that are not uſed to it. But the moleſtation being overcome by cuſtom, it is more eaſily tolerated: and becauſ it eaſeth the pains in the Head, helpeth the Concoction of the Stomach, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigateth the pains of the Chollick, and looſneth a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtive Body, it may be ſomtimes uſeful when Nature is throughly ſatisfied with ſleep, and in this affect it may ſupply the place of Exerciſe. For it ſomtimes hapneth in this Diſeaſ, that Children for ſome time are not without diſadvantage truſted to their own Feet, yea many times they gain more by reſt than walking up and down. For walking rather confirmeth than cureth the
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:169706:184"/>
bended Joynts; but lying down, when the parts are well ſwathed, conduceth not a little to their erection. Then again, lying down helpeth very much to ſtretch and lengthen the ſhort parts, as may be perceived by the growth of the parts in length after a Diſeaſ. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Lying down, in regard of the common Coverings of the whol Body, advanceth an equal diſperſion of the heat through all the parts. Laſtly, lying down, if you obſerve a right way of placing and making the Bed, may contribute very much to correct the crookning of the Back-bone and the whol Body, for when they lie upon the gibbous and bunched Side, a little bag made for the ſame purpoſe may be laid under the parts ſticking out, and ſo made fit that the gibbous parts may in a manner ſuſtain the weight of the whol Body, and ſo they may be compelled as it were to ſtraightneſs. But when Children roul to the other ſide, the bed ſhould be ſo made, that if the little Pillow or Bay be taken away the hollow part ſhould ſcarce touch the bed unleſs he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himſelf to a ſtraight line, that by his weight it may be depreſſed to a ſtraightneſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That kind of exerciſe which is performed <hi>by the rocking of the Cradle ſomwhat emulates this lying down.</hi> The Cradles are ſuſtained upon two Arches, or two parts of a Circle: now the more they have of a Circle, the more effectually they exerciſe the Infant. This motion in time of ſleep muſt be intermitted, or at leaſt remitted; but whilſt the Child waketh it muſt be ſomtimes intended, and ſomtimes remitted. It is moſt profitable for weak Infants that can ſcarce ſtand upon their Feet, or are otherwiſe hindred from waking.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The bearing them about in the Nurſes Arms is almoſt agreable to the ſame Children; and under the ſame conditions:</hi> in like manner the rejoycing
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:169706:184"/>
of the Child whilſt the Nurſ ſingeth, either as it ſits in her Lap, or is held up in her Hands, as alſo the toſſing of it up and down, and waving of it to and fro, and if the Child be ſtrong by holding it gently up by the Hands, if it be weak, under the Arms, yet ſo that the Thighs and the whol Body may hang down. Alſo the drawing of the Children backward and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward upon a Bed or a Table between two Nurſes, the one holding it by a Hand, the other by a Foot. The two laſt motions ſeem to contribute ſomwhat to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the crooked or bended Back-bone, eſpecially if the Hand which is laid upon the depreſſed Shoulder, and the Foot which is belonging to the elevated Hip be drawn with more ſtrength and vehemence than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand or foot. To the ſame end alſo tendeth the lifting up of the Child, taking him by his Feet only, ſo that the trunk of his Body and his Head may for a time hang down in an inverted poſture; although indeed this action may alſo ſeem in ſome manner to relate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the growing to of the Liver, if any ſuch at that time be: as alſo that convolution of the Body, whereby the Head being lowermoſt the Feet are lifted up; and then again the Head being lifted up the whol Body is inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Hitherto alſo may be referred that rouling of the Child, which ſom uſe, upon a Bed or Table, the Body being laterally declined: which we more approve if it be not rouled quite round about, but only backwards and forwards, laying a little hard Cuſhion underneath, wheron the gibbous part may reſt, &amp; ſuſtain the weight of the Body. This exerciſe being rightly practiſed doth help much to ſtraighten the Body.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Sedentery Games and paſtimes</hi> are the leaſt profitable among all exerciſes for Children that have the <hi>Rachites,</hi> and indeed they are only allowable to ſtill
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:169706:185"/>
and quiet them. But the more beneficial wil be to tempt them to a frequent uſe of their Feet by playing ſome little Ball or Cat before them that they may be often kicking them. But if the Body of the Child be croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, ſuch ſports muſt be invented as may allure him to move his Body to the contrary ſide. When therfore one Shoulder is higher than another hold up ſom Gewgaw or Rattle before the Child that he may ſtretch out the Hand belonging to the loweſt Shoulder to reach after the offered object. But a thouſand ſuch like inventions may be found out, and we leave them to the Nurſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Maſculine Exerciſes of greater note</hi> we reduce to theſe three Titles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1 To</hi> Going. <hi>2 To</hi> an Artificial hanging of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. <hi>3 To</hi> Friction, rubbing, and contrectation of the Hypocondries and the Abdomen.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Oſtentation</hi> or <hi>waking</hi> may be numbred amongſt the more noble Exerciſes. For Children that are big and ſtrong, and uſed to run up and down every day, do by walking and ſtirring about, the more eaſily rid away this Diſeaſ. But this kind of Exerciſe muſt be refuſed unto them whoſe Joynts are not knit and confirmed, and whoſe Ankles, Knees &amp; Back are ſo weak that they cannot ſuſtain the Body. For when Children by the negligence of their Nurſes are too ſoon committed to their Feet, it eaſily coms to paſs, that they ſuffer thoſe Joynts to be bended either inwards or outwards, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or forwards, and conſequently they are the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that deformity which befalleth the Bodies of moſt men and women. Moreover, thoſe Children which have already contracted ſuch a bending in their joynts, either by the natural weakneſs and looſneſs of the Ligaments, or by the bad uſage or indiligence of
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:169706:185"/>
their Nurſes, muſt be truſted to exerciſe their Legs, till ſome ſplents or other inſtruments be provided, which may be able to erect the bended Joynts and to keep them in an erected poſture. The driving of Children up and down in their Coaches or Chariots is much to the ſame purpoſe, provided that they be ſo contrived that there be no danger of ſtumbling or overthrowing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The artificial ſuſpenſion of the Body is performed by the help of an Inſtrument cunningly made with ſwathing Bands, firſt croſſing the Breaſt and coming under the Armpits, then about the Head and under the Chin, and then receiving the hands by two handles, ſo that it is a pleaſure to ſee the Child hanging pendulous in the Air, and moved to and fro by the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators. This kind of Exerciſe is thought to be many waies conducible in this Affect, for it helpeth to reſtore the crooked Bones, to erect the bended Joynts, and to lengthen the ſhort Stature of the Body. Moreover, it exciteth the vital Heat, and withal allureth a plentiful diſtribution of the Nouriſhment to the external and firſt affected parts: and in the mean time it is rather a pleaſure than a trouble to the Child. Some that the parts may the more be ſtretched, hang Leaden Shoos upon the Feet, and faſten weights to the Body, that the parts may the more eaſily be extended to an equal length. But this exerciſe is only proper for thoſe that are ſtrong.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Friction or rubbing may in ſome manner be likewiſe referred to Maſculine Exerciſes: nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in reſpect of any active motion in the Child re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to the adminiſtration therof (for it is performed by an action of the Nurſ rather than of the Child) but in reſpect of a like force and efficacy which it hath in the curing of this Affect. Now Friction ſeemeth to be
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:169706:186"/>
twofold, as partly belonging to the kind of Exerciſe, and partly to thoſe things which are outwardly to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, for which cauſ we have reſerved it unto this place, that it might be the laſt in the number of the Exerciſes, and immediately precede the external applications. This muſt be done (at leaſt in the Winter time) by a warm fire, the Child being in all reſpects well fortified from the injuries of the weather, and the violences of the cold Ayr. Some Nurſes adminiſter this Friction with a hot hand, others with Linnen Cloathes dried and heated; others with woolen Cloathes; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers again with a little Bruſh, and indeed ſome do moſt commend the Bruſh, and prefer it before the other waies, but becauſ there ſeemeth to be ſo little difference in all the waies, we approve them all, and leave the choice to the Nurſes wiſdom. But let them begin this Friction at the Back Bone, the Child being laid upon his Belly, and let them ſtir their Hands now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, now downwards, now on each ſide, then to the Thighs, Hips, Legs, Ankles, the Soals of the Feet, and all the parts of the Body, thoſe excepted where there is a ſticking out of the Bones, and there let them rub the hollow part of them. This action muſt not be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued beyond a moderate ruddineſs raiſed in the parts, leſt the Natural heat ſhould be ſcattred, rather than che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed. This kind of exerciſe is moſt agreable to weak Children; and ſuch as are ſcarce able to ſtand or go. For it ſupplieth the defect of running up and down, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeth the Natural heat, ſummoneth the Vital, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracteth the Nouriſhment to the affected parts. Yet we grant that Friction doth not ſo powerfully ſummon the heat and nouriſhment to the Fleſh of the Muſcles, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though perhaps it doth more to the Skin, as exerciſe doth properly ſo called, and conſequently that it muſt
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:169706:186"/>
yield in dignity and nature to true exerciſes. To Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction alſo belongeth that contrectation of the Belly, or of the Abdomen and the Hypochondries, ſomtimes lifting up the Bowels, ſomtimes depreſſing them, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times removing them towards the right, ſomtimes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the left hand, and ſomtimes thruſting in the tops of the Fingers under the Baſtard Ribs. And Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans hope, and not without reaſon, that by this action they may deliver the Liver from any preternatural gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing with the <hi>Peritoneum,</hi> if any ſuch ſhould chance to be. And here we note by the way that ſuch growing of that Bowel may eaſily happen in this affect by reaſon of the greatneſs of the Liver and the ſtretching of the Hypochondriacal parts, wherupon the Peritoneum and the Membrane of the Liver are are moſt neerly and ſtrictly conjoyned, and being conjoyned may remain long in the ſame Poſition, and ſo by the help of time they may eaſily grow together. This growing together in as much as it dependeth (as we have ſaid) upon the ſtretching of the Hypochondries, and the bigneſs of the Liver, it may not incongruouſly be referred to the ſecondary Eſſence of this Diſeaſ, namely, to the orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical parts viciated, among which it deſerves to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned, although above we chanced to omit it in its proper place, and therfore we thought good to mention it here. Thus much of Exerciſes, now follow the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Applications.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXXVI. Things to be Externally Applied.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe remedies (as we have ſaid) do not only prerequire Friction, but for the moſt part they are adminiſtred with a gentle Friction.</p>
            <p>Now they are either General, or Univerſal, reſpecting all parts alike, or Particular, and dedicated to certain Regions of the Body. The matter of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſals is almoſt the ſame with that which we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded above in the Chapterof <hi>Specifical Alterant Remedies:</hi> but the matter of the particulars muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed according to the variety of the Regions of the Body unto which they are applied. The forms of either kind ſeem to be common, and they are five in number, Liquors, Oyls, Liniments, Oyntments, Playſters: although Plaiſters are dedicated rather to certain parts, and never are at once applied to the whol Body.</p>
            <p>Liquors that have been commended by long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in this Affect are almoſt all kinds of Wine; but eſpecially Muskadine. But ſome do prefer the Pruiſian Beer, which indeed may help much to ſtrengthen and conſolidate the Parts, but very little or nothing at all to effect the equation of the Blood, or an equal diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. The ſame judgment is alſo to be made of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligant, as alſo of red Wine. Some inſtead of Wine uſe ordinary <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> which is beleeved to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:169706:187"/>
inferior to Wine, Decoctions alſo may be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the ſame uſe. As,</p>
            <p>Take the Roots of Royal Oſmond, the Leaves of Sage, the Flowers of Marigolds, the Leaves of Bay-tree, Pauls Betony, Hartſtongue, of each half an handful; Roſemary, red Roſes dried, of each one pugil; boyl them in Fountain Water, and ordinary Aqua vitae, of each a pound, to the conſumption of the third part; ſtrain it and keep for your uſe. <hi>Or</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take the roots of the male Fernbrake one ounce, the leaves of royal Oſmond, Clary, Bay tree, Sage, Pauls Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, of each half a handful, infuſe them in ſome Wine, and keep the ſtrained liquor for your uſe.</p>
            <p>But theſe Liquors are ſeldom or never adminiſtred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but muſt be mixt with equal parts of <hi>Oyls, Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> or <hi>Ointments;</hi> and indeed they muſt be uſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a warm fire, and rubbed on with a hot hand til they be dry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Compound Oyls</hi> ſuch as are approved in this Affect are very few, and thoſe ineffectual: but there are many <hi>Simple Oyls,</hi> as Oyl of Earth-worms, Chamamile, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rygold flowers, Pauls Betony, Neats-foot Oyl, unto which you may alſo ad Oyl of Foxes, Oyl of Whelps, Oyl of Swallows, provided that theſe laſt be prepared Simply by themſelves without any commixture of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream hot ingredients.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oyl of Exeter,</hi> although ſome Practitioners uſe it, and though it be a little hotter then is fit to be uſed alone to ſo tender an age as is troubled with this Diſeaſ, and ſo are other things which are vulgarly uſed, as Oyl of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoreum,</hi> or <hi>Jacobi de Manliis,</hi> and <hi>Ung. Antiparalyticis,</hi> and other Ointments, as, <hi>de Nervino, Martiato, Aregon, and the like.</hi> And the reaſon is, becauſe ſuch a numneſs afflicts not theſe as it doth ſuch as are Paralitical, nor
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:169706:188"/>
the ſame Defect of Vital Spirits, nor the ſame unequal diſtribution of nouriſhment. But becauſe this is a new Diſeaſ, if any deſire Oyls, Ointments, or Liniments proper to the Evil, let him make uſe of a right Method, an able Phyſitian, a ſpecifical way either of Oyls or Ointments as we ſhal ſhew you by theſe examples:</p>
            <p>Take the leaves of red Sage, Betony, Pimpernel, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rygold flowrs, of each two handfuls: the roots of royal Oſmund ſix ounces, May Butter three pound, white Wine half a pound: cut the Herbs, bruiſe the Roots, and boil them according to art til the Wine be conſumed: After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſtrain them being yet hot, and put to them oyl of Nutmegs drawn by expreſſion one ounce and an half, mingl them diligently, and after ſetling, caſting away the dregs, make your Ointment, which you may reſerve in a glaſs Veſſel for your uſe. <hi>Or,</hi>
            </p>

            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Take the green leavs of royal Oſmond, ſix handfuls: Pimpernels, Morigold-flowrs, the leavs of red Sage, Clary, Mother-wort, Brook-lime, Watercreſſes, of each a handful: the leavs of Roſemary, Bay, of each half a handful: chop them together very ſmal, and beat them diligently in a Marble or Wooden Morter, with a wooden Peſtle, with ſix pound of unſalted Butter, and ſo let them ſtand fourteen days, then melt them gently in a Bath, and as ſoon as they begin to be hot, ſtrain them, and then put in a new quantity of Herbs as before: at length ſtrain and purify your Ointment, and keep it for occaſions.</p>
            <p>To theſe general external Remedies ſom particular ones relating to ſom certain parts of the Body may be ſub-joyned: as if the region of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> eſpecially the Hypocondria, be ſtretched, hard and ſwelled, and this ſtretching hardneſs, and ſwelling would not yeild to a Purgation though rightly adminiſtred, then you muſt proceed to Local Remedies: As,</p>
            <p>Take Oyl of Capers, Wormwood, Elder, of each one ounce: of the general Ointment firſt deſcribed, one ounce and an half: mingle them and make a Liniment.</p>
            <p>Or,</p>
            <p>Take Ointment of the opening juyces Foeſius three ounces, the firſt general Ointment two ounces, mix them together and make them one Ointment: alſo Oyl of Saxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage made of a manifold infuſion, and boiling of the bruiſed Herb in common Oyl is much to be commended to be mixed with it.</p>
            <p>In the time of uſing it, this and the like Liniments or Unguents may be mingled for penetration ſake with ſom appropriat liquor: As,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="370" facs="tcp:169706:189"/>
Take the flowers of Elder, the flowers of red Sage, Bay-berries bruiſed, white Sanders ſlightly beaten to pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, of each two drams, white Wine two pound, ſteep them for three days in a cold place in a glaſs veſſel accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly ſtopt with Cork, and ſhake it twice a day: when you uſe it, ſtrain as much as will ſerve your preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, then ſtop your veſſel again. <hi>Or, if you deſire a ſtronger,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take the roots of white Bryony well dryed and ſliced, Bay-berries, Gooſ-dung, of each two drams: Cummin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeds one dram: the leavs of red Sage, the flowrs of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, of each one pugil; boil them in one pound and a half of Rheniſh-wine to a pound: keep the Decoction in a cold place diligently ſtopped.</p>
            <p>Theſe and the like Liquors mingled with the Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and heated at the fire, muſt be rubbed upon the Abdomen, and eſpecially the Hypochondries, even to drineſs. Let the Nurſe alſo having well warmed her hands, handle thoſe parts gently, ſomtimes preſſing the Bowels upwards, ſomtimes downwards, ſomtimes to the right hand, and ſomtimes to the left, according to our former Directions.</p>
            <p>The moſt galent thing of all is the Balſom of Tolu mixed with any Oyntment or Plaiſter, and ſo applied to the Region of the Back either in form of an Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Playſter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plaiſters</hi> alſo ſeem to contribute ſomthing. As Take three ounces of <hi>Ceratum ſantalinum; Gum Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacum diſſolved in Rhenniſh Wine,</hi> or <hi>in ſom other medicated wine above deſcribed, purified and boyled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to a thickneſs,</hi> one ounce: make your <hi>Plaiſter</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to art. Spread part of this upon Leather and lay it upon the right <hi>Hypochondry,</hi> or elſ the left, if the hardneſs be there moſt ſenſible, which indeed is very ſeldom. Or</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="371" facs="tcp:169706:189"/>
               <hi>Take</hi> the Juyces of Brooklime, Watercreſſes, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-Scurvygraſs, Wormwood, the bark of Elder, the roots of the male Fernbrake, <hi>of each one ounce:</hi> Let the Juy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be purified with a gentle heat, and being extracted reduce them to a thick body, then ad one dram &amp; an half of Mace, and two drams of yellow Sanders in pouder.</p>
            <p>Take of this Mixture one ounce and an half: Gum Ammoniac. diſſolved in Wine and boyled to a body <hi>four ounces.</hi> Mingle them bot, and ſtir them continually till they begin to wax cool and hard, and make a Plaiſter to be applied as the former.</p>
            <p>Moreover, when the Lungs are il affected many times <hi>a peculiar pectoral Plaiſter</hi> is very uſeful. As</p>
            <p>Take Oyl of Violets, white Lillies, and the Ointment of Orenge flowers, <hi>of each one ounce:</hi> Mingle them and make a Liniment to be rubbed with a hot hand upon the Breaſt, laying a Lawn Paper over it lined with Wool or linen cloth. <hi>To this Liniment you may ad a ſmal quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of</hi> Natural Balſom. <hi>Or</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take <hi>two ounces</hi> Unguent. Pectorale; <hi>an ounce and an half</hi> of ſimple Ointment of Liquoris: <hi>one ounce of</hi> Oyl of Violets. <hi>Mingle them</hi> and make a Liniment to be uſed after the ſame manner.</p>
            <p>The Ointment of <hi>Liquoris</hi> is thus made.</p>
            <p>Take new and Juycy Liquoris <hi>four ounces:</hi> new un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalted Butter waſht in Roſe water <hi>one pound:</hi> ſlice the Liquoris and beat it wel with the Butter in a ſtone Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, afterwards fry them, then ſtrain and ſqueeze them, and repeat the ſame labor thrice with a new quantity of Liquoris.</p>
            <p>Again, Som Plaiſters may be prepared proper againſt the weakneſs of the Back, which very frequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in this Affect. In the Shops you may have the <hi>Plaiſter of Betony,</hi> and <hi>Diachalcitheos,</hi> unto which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:169706:190"/>
when you uſe them, you muſt ad <hi>Maſtich</hi> and <hi>Olibanum in pouder</hi> of each half a dram: the Plaiſter alſo which is called <hi>Flos Unguentum</hi> may hither be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, provided that you omit the <hi>Camphire,</hi> in like manner alſo <hi>Emplaſtrum Nervinum.</hi> Or</p>
            <p>Take two ounces of the firſt general Oyntment; five of the Herbs that are contained in that Compoſition, cut and chopped very ſmal; Yellow Wax four ounces; the pureſt Roſin eight ounces: the Oyntment, Roſin, and Wax, being melted ad the Herbs and according to art make a Plaiſtrr. <hi>Or</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take fifteen ounces of the third general Oyntment; Litharge of Gold beaten ſmal and ſifted nine ounces; boyl them together continually ſtirring them to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of a Plaiſter; then ad Wax, Burgundy Pitch, of each three ounces; Oyl of Nutmegs by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> expreſſion three drams; Maſtich, Olibanum, Mirrh, of each one dram and an half; Coſtorium half a dram; white Vitriol in pouder half an ounce; make your Plaiſter according to art.</p>
            <p>The Practioners in Phyſick differ in the Figure, and about the Application of theſe Plaiſters. Some chuſe a longiſh and narrow Figure, and apply it according to the length of the Back-bone. Others appprove a broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh and almoſt <figure/> triangular Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, ſuch as you ſee here, and they extend it from the Loyns, downward upon the <hi>Os ſacrum,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the utmoſt end therof. But when the lower parts of the Back-bone, as alſo the Knees and Legs, namely thoſe parts which bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row their Nerves from the lower part of the Spine, are weaker than the Superior, we do
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:169706:190"/>
not judg this latter to be a convenient form; but when the upper parts of the Back-bone ſeem to be the weaker, we ſuppoſe the former longiſh form to be the more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable.</p>
            <p>In like manner ſome commend a Liniment for the weakneſs of the Back-bone which conſiſteth <hi>of Gelly of Harts-horn, made with ſuch things as ſtrengthen the Sinews, adding the Flowers of Sage, and the Roots of our Ladies Seal.</hi> In the time of anointing mingle ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with a little <hi>Oyl of Nutmegs by expreſſion, or Oyl of Worms,</hi> or <hi>Mans Graſs.</hi> And thus much of external Remedies.</p>
