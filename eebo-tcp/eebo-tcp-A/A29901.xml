         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>A Work of this nature, that
would so hardly find a
Patron, will stand the more
in need of a Preface; Men that write
in commendation of Learning, usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
seek out some great <hi>Genius</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix
to their Book, whom they make an
Instance of all the Learning and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
that are described in it; were
I to chuse a Patron, consistently with
my design, I must Compliment him
with the weakness of his Parts and
shortness of his Vnderstanding, which
is such a Compliment, as I presume
I shall willingly be excus'd from.
But th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n a Preface will be the more
<pb facs="tcp:64296:3"/>
necessary to give an account of my
undertaking, which is rather to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into the abuses, and to show
the insufficiency of Humane Learning,
than wholly to descredit its use. No
Man e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er did this, without disp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
his own Vnderstanding, nor
decry'd Learning but for want of it;
it having been an old Observation,
that will hold perpetually, That
Knowledge has no Enemies except
the Ignorant. An attempt of this
nature would be utterlly impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
for either it would be well
perform'd, and then it must be done
by reasons borrow'd from the Stores
of Learning, by which means by
reasoning against Learning, we must
at the same time reason for it, and
all our Arguments must return upon
us; or if the performance were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned,
it would be to no purpose,
and might as well be let alone. This
then is no part of my design.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:64296:3"/>All that I intend, is, to take it
down from its suppos'd heights, by
exposing the vanity of it in several
particulars, its Insufficiency in the
rest, and I believe I might say, its
difficulties, in all: And there is
the more need of this in an Age, in
which it seems to be too much mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifi'd,
and where Men are fond of
Learning almost to the loss of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
Learning is our great <hi>Diana,</hi>
nothing will pass with our Men of
Wit and Sense, but what is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with the nicest Reason, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Man's Reason is his own Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing:
For if you examine them
to the bottom, these mighty Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

               </gap>e no truer grounds to go
upon than other Men, only they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
a liberty of judging according to
themselves, and (if they could be
allow'd it) of making their own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
a Standard of others. They
plead for right Reason, but they
mean their own, and talk of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
<pb facs="tcp:64296:4"/>
Religion, whilst their own
false Notions are mistaken for it;
and while they seek the Goddess,
they embrace a Cloud. In the mean
time, they take us of from our surest
Guide, Religion suffers by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
about it, and we are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of running into Natural Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>Where these things will end, God
only kmows, it is to be suspected,
they may at last end in the thing we
fear, and may bring us about to that
Religion, for which of all others,
we have the most abhorrence: For
after Men have try'd the force of
natural Reason in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they will soon be sensible of its
weakness, and after they have run
themselves out of breath and can cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
no where, they will be glad of any
hold where they think they can find it,
and rather than be always wandring,
they will take up with an <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Guide.</hi> I am unwilling to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb facs="tcp:64296:4"/>
such hard Thoughts of a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Church, as to think they are
sowing Discord among us to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
but I much fear, we are doing
their Work for them, and by our own
Divisions, are making way for a
<hi>Blind Faith, and Implicit Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi>
And may it never be said,
That as Learning was one grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
under God, to bring about
a Reformation, so the Abuse of it, by
the Divine Permission, has brought us
back to the same place from whence we
came, and that our Enemies have
done that by secret Engines, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestic
Distractions, which by open
A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tempts they were never able to do.
It is the sense of such Dangers and
such Abuses <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ha has drawn from me
these Reflections, and has inclin'd
me to harder Thoughts, and possibly,
to say, harsher things of some parts
of Learning, than will be agreeable
to the Humor of the Age, and yet if
any one who thinks thus of me, will

               </gap>one for the hardest things,
that shall be said in the Book.</p>
            <p>I am sure I am not singular in this
Design, one of the first Restorers of
Letters,<note n="a" place="margin">Ple. Mirand. Exam. Van. Doct. Gent. Op. vol. 2. p. 467.</note> A Man noted for his
Piety as well as Parts, has writ a
Book to this purpose, but it having
been principally levell'd against <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>'s
Philosophy, which is now so
much out of Credit, that it rather
wants an Advocate to defend it, than
a new Adversary to run it down, the
Book it self is as much out of use, as
the Philosophy is, that it designs to
decry. He was follow'd in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
by <hi>Lodovicus Vives</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">De Corrupt. Art. Op. vol. 1. p. 221.</note> in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Latin,</hi> and with greater Eloquence,
but <hi>Vives</hi>'s main Talent having been
in Philology, and having been less
conversant in Philosophical Matters,
his Book is both very defective as to
<pb facs="tcp:64296:5"/>
the Particulars it treats of, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
suited to the Ancient Literature,
is less agreeable to the Genius of our
Age. What <hi>Cornelius Agrippa</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">De van. Scient.</note>
has writ upon this Subject is chiefly
declamatory, and fitter for School-Boys,
than of any just Moment or
Consideration in a serious Enquiry.
And a <hi>French</hi> Book<note n="d" place="margin">La va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite des Sciences, Ams. 88.</note> lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
upon the same Subject and with
the same Title, tho' well and piously
Writ, yet has nothing in it of what
I expected, and is rather a Sermon,
than a Treatise of <hi>Science.</hi> None of
these Authors, nor any other I have
yet met with, have come up full to
my purpose, nor have I been able to
borrow much help from them;
where I have, I have quoted them,
and if in any other things we hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to agree, without remembring
them, it is a fault of Memory, and I
make this acknowledgement once for
all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:64296:6"/>Sir <hi>W. Temple,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
have turn'd their Pens the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way, and have been so much
taken up with describing the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Excellencies of Learning, as
to have less occasion to discover its
Faults; tho' it was scarce possible,
whilst they cross'd one another's Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
either to commend Ancient
Learning, without entring into the
Defects of the Modern, or to prefer
the Moderns, without censuring the
Ancients; so that by consequence tho'
not professedly, they have fal'n into
this Controversie. I have, as far as
possible, avoided saying any thing that
has been observed by them already,
(tho' perhaps this may be thought
my fault, and I may thereby have
said worse things of my own) and if
in any other things I have contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, I have done it in so tender
a manner, as neither of them could
blame, were they yet both Living. I
have treated all Men with Decency
<pb facs="tcp:64296:6"/>
and Respect, except Mons. <hi>Le Clerc,</hi>
who has not deserv'd such Treatment.
I have seen little of Monsieur <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rault,</hi>
and a considerable part both
of his and Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi>'s Books,
come not within my Account of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
for I have nothing to say to
Sculpture, Painting, Architecture,
Gardening, Agriculture, &amp;c. which
I take to be more properly of Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Consideration. But if Learned
Men will needs include these likewise
within the compass of Learning, it
shall give me no disturbance: The
Bounds of Learning are of late won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
enlarged, and for oug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t I
know, Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Trade Papers may
pass in time for a Volume of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Not that there is any need of swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Account, for Learning is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
become so Voluminous, that it
begins to sink under its own weight,
Books crowd in daily and are heap'd
upon Books, and by the Mul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>itude of
<pb facs="tcp:64296:7"/>
them, both distract our Minds, and
discourage our Endeavors. Those
that have been writ upon <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
are almost innumerable; In a very
few Centuries, from <hi>Albertus Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
till a short time after <hi>Luther,</hi>
there have been Twelve Thousand
Authors, that have either Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
upon his Books, or follow'd him
in his Opinions: This we have from
good Authority, tho' the Author that
reports and censures it, had surely
forgot, that he himself has strengthen'd
the Objection, by publishing a gross
Volume, only to give an Account of
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> his Writings, and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.

            <p>I have notwithstanding adventur'd

LEARNING, &amp;c.</head>
            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <p>SInce I first begun to think, I have
always had a mean opinion of
two things, Humane Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and Humane Will;
The weakness of the latter is a
confessed thing; we all of us feel it, and
most Men complain of it, but I have
scarce yet met with any, that would
own the weakness of his Understanding:
And yet they both spring from the same
corrupt Fountain; and the same cause,
that has derived Contagion upon the
Will, has spread Darkness upon the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64296:10"/>
Understanding; and however Men may
please themselves with an opinion of their
own Wisdom, it is plain, the wisest
Men know little, and they that are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
of themselves and boast the highest,
do usually see least, and are only wise
for want of thinking.</p>
               <p>We have had a mighty Controversie of
late betwixt the Old and New Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
and great inquiry has been made,
whether the preference is to be given
to the Ancient or Modern Learning;
For my part I will not venture to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
in so warm a Controversie, but 'tis
some argument to me, that we have not
over much of the thing, otherwise we
should know better where to find it,
and if I would say any thing, I should
be of opinion, that neither side has rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to boast. What the Wisdom of
the Ancients was, is not so easily known
at this distance, by those Specimens of
it that are left us, it does not appear
to have had any thing in it very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
or which might not be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to by their Posterity without
standing upon their Shoulders; Have
not some dark and oracular expressions
been esteemed enough to entitle a Man
to the Reputation of Wisdom? And was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64296:10"/>
not any odd and sometimes extravagant
opinion, if subtilely maintained, suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to set a Man at the Head of a Party,
and make him the Author of a Sect of
Philosophers? The most Ancient Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
was usually wrapt up and involv'd
in Symbols and Numbers, which as far
as they can be explained, do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
any thing very mysterious, but it
was the interest of these Great Men to
keep a distance and be always in the
Clouds, that they might be thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
and procure a veneration by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
obscurity of their Writings. They that
have writ more plainly, have (at least
some of them) been plain to an objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n,
and have said little more, than what
good Sence improv'd by Observation
and Thought, would suggest to most
Men without reading; To say nothing
here of the vast variety of Opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, which will fall in more
properly in the thread of my Discourse;
they did not agree in the first <hi>Criterions</hi>
of Truth, which they have made as
many and as different as could possibly
be thought of and carried their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
so far, that it put the <hi>Scepticks</hi>
pretty early upon doubting of every
thing, and at last brought them to deny;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64296:11"/>
that there was any such thing as Truth
in the World.</p>
               <p>The moderns have not yet gone so far,
but they have made some advances, and
seem by pretty easie consequences to be
leading us towards it: For since <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>'s
Philosophy has been exploded in the
Scholes, under whom we had more
peace, and possibly almost as much Truth
as we have had since, we have not been
able to fix any where, but have been
wavering from one Opinion to another.
The Platonick Philosophy was first intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
with the Greek Learning, and
wonderfully obtain'd for some time, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Men of Polite Letters; but
however Divine it might seem at first
and for that reason was entertain'd more
favourably, it was found upon a short
tryal to lead to Heresie, and so went off
again under a Cloud. The moderns
were now wise enough to set up for
themselves, and were more pleas'd with
their own inventions, than with the dry
Systems of the Old Philosophers. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
attempts were made unsuccessfully,
nor had they set out long or done much,
till they had run themselves into such a
maze, That <hi>M. Des Cartes</hi> thought it
necessary to sit down and doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64296:11"/>
they were not all out of the way:
His doubts increased upon him by doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and he must have continu'd under
them, had he not by a strange turn of
Thought struck Evidence out of Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty;
for he found such strength and
conviction in doubting, that he brings
an Argument from it to prove a first
Truth, The reality of his own Existence:
He likewise borrowed great light from
<hi>Ideas,</hi> which have been since improv'd,
by comparing their agreement and disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
with one another, and with
the Reality of things; and since that
conformity has not been evident enough,
we have been consulting the <hi>Divine</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
or <hi>Ideal World,</hi> to fetch thence more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<hi>Ideas,</hi> and are at last come to see
all things in God; A way, which could
it be as easily made out, as it is asserted,
I do not see, what we could desire
further, for we shall hardly see more
clearly in a state of Glory: But all
these particulars we shall meet with, as
we go along.</p>
               <p>What has been said of Philosophy, is
true in other sorts of Learning, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we may be puffed up with vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
and may flatter our selves with
discoveries of <hi>New Worlds</hi> of Learning,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64296:12"/>
and fancy there is little bid from the
profound Search and accurate Enquiries
of so learned an Age, to me it seems we
are yet much in the Dark, that many of
our discoveries are purely imaginary,
and that the state of Learning is so far
from perfection, much more from being
the Subject of Oftentation, That it ought
to teach us Modesty and keep us Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
To this end, I propose to trace
it in its several Branches; and were
the management of my Argument an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to the truth of it, I should not
doubt of giving satisfaction to impartial
Readers.</p>

               <p>LAnguages being the <hi>Chanels</hi> by which
most of our Learning is convey'd,
it is necessary to the attaining of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that these should be kept clear
and open; if the Streams in these run
muddy, or are corrupted, all the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that is convey'd by them, must be
obscure: words at the best are no ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
certain signs of things, they are lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ambiguity, and under that am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity
are often subject to very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
meanings; and tho' this, as far as
it is the common condition of Speech
must be submitted to, and is no objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in plain Laws and easie Precepts,
that are intelligible enough in any Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
yet in matters of Science, it is much
otherwise; these are nice things; the
strict meaning is to be observ'd in them;
nor can we mistake a word without losing
the Notion.</p>
               <p>The first Language, the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> was
very plain and simple, (a good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64296:13"/>
of its being an original) consisting
of few Roots, and those very simple and
uncompounded: it seems fitted for the
purposes, for which it was design'd, which
was not so much to improve Men's
knowledge, as to better their lives, and
this end it did perfectly answer: Indeed
the Ancient Tongues are generally the
most uncompounded, and consequently
more plain and easie; but then whilst
things continue thus, as Languages were
easie, so they were defective, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as from necessity Men were put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
improving Speech; so particularly as
Arts increased, Languages grew up with
them, and Men were put upon coining
new words to express the new Ideas
they had of things. This has enlarged
the Bounds of Language, and swoln it
to such a height, that its Redundancy
is now a greater Inconvenience, than the
defectiveness of it was before.</p>
               <p>The Inconveniences from Languages
are chiefly two, First, Their variety, and
Secondly, Their mutability. 1. Were
there only one Language in the World,
Learning would be a much easier thing,
than it now is; Men might then imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
apply to things, whereas now a
great part of our time is spent in Words,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64296:13"/>
and that with so little advantage, that
we often blunt the edge of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
by dealing with such rough and
unpleasant tools: For however apt Men
may be to over-value the Tongues, and
to think they have made a considerable
progress in Learning, when they have
once overcome these, yet in reality there
is no internal worth in them, and Men
may understand a thousand Languages
without being the wiser, unless they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the things, that they deliver:
It is in order to this that they are to
be learnt, and it is the hard condition of
Learning, that in this respect, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be without them; This labour must
necessarily be devour'd in our way to
Knowledge, and every Man must dig in
this Mine, that hopes to be Master of
the Treasure, it conceals; much dross is
to be separated, and many difficulties to
be overcome.</p>
               <p>When I speak of the variety of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
I do not mean that all of them
are necessary, at least not to all sorts of
Learning, were this our case, we could
have few compleat Scholars; but tho' all
of them be not necessary, yet some of
them are allowed to be so, particularly
such as are styl'd Learned; and there is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64296:14"/>
such a connexion among most Tongues of
the same kind, that it is hard to excell in
any one, without some tolerable skill in
the rest. This is pretty plain in the Greek
and Latin, and the reason is clear in the
Eastern Tongues, where the affinity is
greater. Two of the Languages that in
their different kinds pretend to most Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
(I do not here inquire, how truly)
are the <hi>Arabic</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> and it happens
not well, that these two are the most co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
and difficult. They that have skill
<note n="a" place="margin">V. Walt. Proleg. 14 <hi>§.</hi> 6.</note> in the first assure us, that it abounds in
Synonymous Words, that it has five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
words for a Lyon, and almost a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
for a Sword, which are enough to
make an intire Language, and almost as
many as all the <hi>Radicals</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
Tongue. And as for the <hi>Greek,</hi> which is
uncontestedly Learned, most know how
copious it is, for tho' its <hi>Radicals</hi> are
not so many as might be imagin'd, which
some have computed not much to exceed
three thousand,<note n="b" place="margin">Wilk. R. Ch. cap. ult.</note> yet this is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made up in its Compositions, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
simple it may be in its <hi>Roots,</hi> it spreads
very widely in its Branches: If we add
to this, its many different dialects, and
all the various Inflections of Nouns and
Verbs, which diversifie words, and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64296:14"/>
them from themselves, this will
swell the account much higher, and make
it almost an Infinite thing. So that what
from the variety of Languages, and the
<hi>Copia</hi> of those that are reputed Learned,
one great obstruction lies in the way of
Learning.</p>
               <p>The other inconvenience is from their
mutability, for whatever their number
may be, yet were their nature fix'd and
their condition stated, the measures that
are taken from them might be more sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
but when to the multitude of them,
we add their mutability, we are still un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
greater difficulties. Words, like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, are subject to the common
Fate of vicissitude and change; they are
always in Flux, ebbing and flowing, and
have scarce any fixed period: for being
govern'd by Custom, which it self de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon one of the most unconstant
things in the World, the humour of the
People, it is scarce possible it should be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise:
no Prince ever gave Laws to
these, <hi>Caesar</hi> who gave Laws to <hi>Rome,</hi>
could give none to its Language, and it
was look'd upon as the height of flattery
in that Sycophant, that offer'd to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
him with such an extravagant
Power; in this Custom is only absolute.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64296:15"/>
We can scarce have a better instance of
this, than in the Tongue we are now speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of, the Latin; that Language that
was spoke soon after the Foundation of
<hi>Rome,</hi> was perfectly unintelligible in the
Age of <hi>Augustus;</hi> nay, some hundred years
after that period, and not 150, before <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi>'s
time, the Tongue that was then vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
can hardly now be understood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Comment. This is evident from
the Inscription on the <hi>Columna Rostrata,</hi>
that is yet in being, and a Copy of which
has been given us by Bishop <hi>Walton</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Proleg. p. 5.</note>.
In <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Age, that Tongue was in its full
height, it had been growing up till then,
ever after it was declining, and had only
one short Stage of Perfection. They that
came after were observ'd to write with
some mixture, even <hi>Livy</hi> had his <hi>Patavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
which is most probably understood
of a tincture from his Country Education.</p>
               <p>Successively on, they were more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
<hi>Paterculus, Seneca,</hi> &amp;c. still writ with
a greater mixture, till at last either by
mixing with Foreign Nations, in sending
Colonies, or by the breaking in of Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
People upon them, the Language sunk
into decay and became utterly Barbarous.</p>
               <p>The Greek Tongue had the same For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
with the Latine, tho' it continu'd
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64296:15"/>
vulgar longer; for as <hi>Greece</hi> did assist the
<hi>Romans</hi> in giving perfection to their
Speech, (they having not begun to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate
Arts, or polish their Language, till
they had subdu'd <hi>Greece</hi>) so they receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a great tincture and corruption from
their Conquerors, either first, when
they became an accession to their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
as appears from those that writ
in that Tongue after the reduction of
<hi>Greece;</hi> or after, when the Empire was
translated to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and that City
became new <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Seat of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
From that time, the Greek sunk
apace, as must needs be expected, where
the Latine was the Court Language, and
made use of in their Laws and Courts of
Judicature, and the Greek in a manner
confin'd to the vulgar. In <hi>Iustinian's</hi>
time, who was not very long after <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi>
it is plain, it was much corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as is evident, from the <hi>Acts</hi> of the
Councils of these times, and the Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
of the People and Clergy on such
occasions, Instances whereof are given by
<hi>Du Fresne,</hi> in his Learned Preface to his
<hi>Greek Glossary</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">§. 7.</note>. As we descend lower
the corruption is greater, as is shown by
the same Learned Person: The reduction
of <hi>Constantinople</hi> by the <hi>Franks</hi> was one
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64296:16"/>
other great blow, the last and fatal stroke
was given by that Deluge of Barbarism,
in the Inundation of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who bore
down all before them. What the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it now is, may be seen in <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> whence will appear not only the
present corrupt State of that Tongue,
but also the Reasons from which it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds,
either from the mixture of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,
the <hi>Turco-Arabic,</hi> and other foreign
Tongues; or by dividing Words that
should be conjoyn'd, or running two
Words into one that should be divided,
or by other faults in <hi>Orthography,</hi> that is
now in great neglect among them. And
what is most melancholy in the account,
is, That even at <hi>Athens,</hi> that was once
Renown'd for Learning and Eloquence,
their Tongue is now more corrupt and
barbarous, than in any other part of
<hi>Greece;</hi> to that degree, as is there taken
notice of, that it would draw tears from
any one to observe<note n="f" place="margin">ib. p. 99.</note> the miserable
change. In all parts of <hi>Greece,</hi> their
Speech is so far degenerated from its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
purity, that as a Learned Greek can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
throughly understand the modern vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Tongue, much less is the Ancient
Greek understood by the moderns.</p>

                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:64296:16"/>Now under this great multiplicity, as
well as change, what difficulties are we
to struggle with, and what uncertainties
are to be overcome? Our Words are so
many, and so uncertain, that there is both
great difficulty in becoming Masters of
them, and after that in fixing and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
their Sense: We are to trace them
up to their first Originals, and afterwards
to pursue them down to their last Decay,
to mark their several times and periods,
in all which they much vary, and are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
capable of different meanings, or their
true meaning is very obscure. There is
only one way of coming at their meaning,
after they become dead Languages and
cease to be vulgar, by the Books that have
been writ in them; but besides the want
we are in of some of these, and defects in
those we have, tho' they might serve well
enough for common ends and uses, yet
the things we are now enquiring after,
are matters of <hi>Science,</hi> which are abstruse
things, and not so easie to be exprest in
such proper terms, as are not liable to be
mis-understood; Such particularly are
Terms of Art, that must needs be obscure
as being too comprehensive, and taking
in more notions than one under the same
Word: Which tho' of good use, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64296:17"/>
designed to make knowledge more
compendious, yet have frequently turn'd
the other way, by requiring large Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that have been often writ upon a
single word, and perhaps after all, have
left it more doubtful than it was before.</p>
               <p>Dictionaries indeed have been called in
to our assistance, which have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil'd
with much pains and in great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
not only for Words, but for Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Arts, but besides the no great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
that is among them, they are
swoln to such a height, and become so
numerous, that those very Books that
were design'd as helps, now breed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
and their Bulk and Number is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Burthen. Such alone as have been
compos'd for the French Tongue (which
as yet is no Learned Language, tho' it
bids pretty fair for it) would fill a Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and only one of those, and that not
the largest, has been the work of fourty
Years, tho' it was carri'd on by the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
labours of the French <hi>Academy;</hi> after
all which care, it has not escap'd censure
but has been thought to want Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and does thereby show how impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it is to set Bounds, or give a Standard
to Language, for which purpose it was
design'd: Not only every Tongue, but
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64296:17"/>
every Faculty has met with this help, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionaries
are become a great part of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and nothing remains, but that as
it has far'd with <hi>Bibliotheques,</hi> which were
grown so numerous, that<note n="g" place="margin">V. Ant. Teisser. v. Ph. Lab.</note> a <hi>Biblio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theca
Bibliothecarum</hi> was thought a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
work, so Dictionaries should have
the like service done them; a <hi>Dictionari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
Dictionariorum,</hi> might be a work of
some use, I am sure of great Bulk, and I
wonder it has not been yet undertaken.</p>
               <p>To redress and heal all these inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies,
an universal Remedy has indeed
been thought of, a <hi>Real Character and
Philosophical Language,</hi> a work that has
been pursu'd of late with great applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and with some expectations of success
and advantage; But however plausible
this may seem at a distance, it is to be
fear'd, it is only so in Theory, and that
upon Tryal, it will be found an impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
thing. For this Language being
design'd not to express words but things,
we must first be agreed about the nature
of things, before we can fix Marks and
Characters to represent them, and I very
much despair of such an agreement. To
name only one, when Bishop <hi>Wilkins</hi> first
undertook this design,<note n="h" place="margin">Real. Char. Par. 2. v. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Substance</hi> and
<hi>Accidents</hi> were a receiv'd Division, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64296:18"/>
accordingly in ranking things, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
them to Heads, (which is the great
excellency of this Design) He proceeds
according to the order they stand in, of
<hi>Substance</hi> and <hi>Accidents,</hi> in the <hi>Scale</hi> of
<hi>Praedicaments;</hi> but were he to begin now
and would suit his design to the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
in vogue, he must draw a new Scheme
and instead of <hi>Accidents</hi> must take in <hi>Modes,</hi>
which are very different from Accidents
both in Nature and Number. Bishop
<hi>Wilkins</hi> was an extraordinary Person, but
very projecting, and I doubt this design
may go along with his <hi>Daedalus</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimedes,</hi>
and be ranked with his <hi>flying
Chariot</hi> and <hi>voyage to the Moon.</hi> The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
of Tongues was inflicted by God
as a Curse upon humane Ambition, and
may have been continu'd since for the
same reason; and as no Remedy has been
yet found, so it is most probable, it is
not to be expected, nor are we to hope
to unite that which God has divided. The
Providence of God may have so order'd
it for a check to Men's Pride, who are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
apt to be building <hi>Babels,</hi> were
there no difficulties to obstruct and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
them in their way.</p>

among the Latins have treated of this
Subject. In our times the Common
Grammar that goes under the name of
Mr. <hi>Lily</hi> was done by some of the most
considerable Men of the Age; The
English Rudiments by Dr. <hi>Colet Dean</hi>
of <hi>Paul</hi>'s, with a Preface to the first E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
directing its use by no less Man
than <hi>Cardinal Wolsey;</hi> The most Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

Learned Men, and he perhaps had

               <p>Were there more of <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Varro</hi>

Helps: Tho from those short Specimens
we have of <hi>Caesar,</hi> we were not to expect

by<note n="k" place="margin">L. 19. c. 8.</note>

                     </gap>ius</hi>
an Ancient Grammarian, and always to
correct him, as he will seem to deserve to
any one who will take the pains to consult
the particular places: And as for <hi>Varro,</hi>
his Books are chiefly about the Etymolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
of words, which are of no great use,
being obscure and uncertain.</p>
               <p>The following Grammarians are yet
more defective, we have a large Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of them put out by <hi>Putschius,</hi> who
(against the custom of most Editors,
that seldom us'd to speak disparagingly
of their Authors) ingenuously confesseth,
that some of them were scarce worth
an Edition. And most of them having
been writ, either when Learning was low,
or after Barbarism had begun to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow
the Empire, it is no wonder, that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64296:19"/>
they do not rise above their Level, or
that while they lay down Rules in this
Art, they scarce write in tolerable Latin:
<hi>Priscian</hi> himself will be no exception to
this, who notwithstanding his strictness
in giving Rules and severity in censuring
others, has much ado to preserve himself
from Barbarism: Let any one read some
of his first lines, he will need go no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to make a judgment.</p>
               <p>Some of our Modern Criticks have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
well of this Art, who as they
have us'd more perspicuity, so they have
writ with much greater Purity, than most
of the Ancient Grammarians have done:
<hi>Valla, Erasmus,</hi> and our <hi>Linacer</hi> have taken
much pains and shown great Judgment
in this matter; and yet after all, as if
nothing had been done, ariseth <hi>Sanctius,</hi>
and after him <hi>Schioppius,</hi> and Correct
all that had gone before them. <hi>Cicero</hi>
and <hi>Quinctilian</hi> were blind with these
Men, who make such discoveries, as
never had been thought of, by any of
the Ancients; all Grammar before them
was, <hi>Cloacina,</hi> polluted and full of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes;
theirs only is the true way,
which they pretend is highly Rational,
containing few and easie Rules, and
under these scarce any exceptions. Tho
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64296:20"/>
if this new method be examin'd, it will
be found as fallacious, and they as fallible
as other Men: <hi>Sanctius</hi>'s great principle
on which he goes, is, That Languages,
and particularly the Latin, are not pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
arbitrary, or depending barely on
use and custom, but that an Analogy has
been observed, and a reason may be given
of the Idioms of Tongues, and upon this
he builds a Rational Grammar. This
perhaps might hold in some measure
in the Hebrew, as far as its words were
impos'd upon just Reasons; but in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
Tongue which he treats of, that was
first form'd and afterwards grew up in
confusion; and under a People, while they
were yet Barbarous, we are not to expect
such mighty Regularity. The <hi>Romans</hi>
knew nothing of Grammar, till the times
of <hi>Ennius,</hi> when that Tongue was pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
well grown, and consequently could
have no great regard to it in forming
their Language, and therefore for any
one now, to pretend to fix the Analogy
of words, or to reduce all under strict
Rule, is to set bounds where they were
never intended, and to find a Reason
that was never meant. Had Grammar
been as ancient as Languages, we might
have proceeded in this manner, but it
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64296:20"/>
being invented only as a help, and not
fram'd originally as an Immutable rule, we
must suit it to our business as well as we
can, but are not to expect, it should be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
and not liable to many exceptions.</p>
               <p>To take a short view of some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
1. As to Letters, we are not yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
about their Original, which might
be of use in fixing our Alphabets, for tho
the Greek letters, and from them the
Latin, seem deriv'd from the <hi>Phoenician</hi>
and these again from the ancient <hi>Hebrew,</hi>
as has been attempted to be shown, not
only from History, but from the affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of letters, by turning the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
Characters towards the Right hand, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our way of reading; yet there
lies one great objection against this,
That <hi>Cadmus</hi> who brought the <hi>Phoenician,</hi>
letters among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> is only said to
have brought sixteen, and therefore must
have left some behind him, for the <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nician</hi>
or <hi>Hebrew</hi> Alphabet was always
fixt, and of the same length as now,
since we have had any writing, a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Evidence of which we have in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Alphabetical Psalms and Chapters.
Were this more certain, it would help
to determine our Alphabets, both as
to their Numbers and Powers, whereas
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64296:21"/>
now we are uncertain in both, and there
are great disputes among the Criticks, as
to some of the Elements, whether they
be letters or no.</p>
               <p>(2.) In the Etymological or Analogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
part, we labour under the same dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties;
nor can it be otherwise, where
Languages were so much the effect of
chance, and were not fram'd by any set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
or established Rules. When <hi>Varro</hi>
writ his Book, <hi>De Lingua Latina,</hi> it is
plain this Analogy was a disputable thing,
he brings several objections against, as
well as reasons for it, and his Instances
are so many, and his objections so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
that he must needs be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have left it doubtful. In the same
Age, when a question was put by <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
to most of the Learned Men in <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note n="m" place="margin">V. A. Gell. l. 10. cap. 1.</note> concerning the Analogy of a very
common word, they could come to no
resolution about it, tho' <hi>Cicero</hi> was one
of the number, and so it was left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determin'd.
And if the thing were so
much controverted among them, who
had better opportunities of enquiry, as
living nearer the Original, when many
monuments of Antiquity were left, and
the Latin yet a living Language, among
them; it must needs be much more so
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64296:21"/>
to us, who live at this distance, and want
many of their helps: Our greatest light
must be borrowed from their Books, and
we can be only more happy in the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
Accordingly we follow them
pretty close, and are much more directed
by the custom-of Ancient and Approved
Authors, than by the reason of words that
is perpetually varying. How many words
are there agreeable enough with Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
and of Modern use among learned
Men, which yet, because they are not us'd
by the Ancients, are not only dislik'd, but
are look'd upon by the Critics, as <hi>vitia
Sermonis?</hi> Innumerable instances may be
had<note n="n" place="margin">De vit. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sim.</note> in <hi>Vossius:</hi> few Men would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to use, <hi>Incertitudo, Ingratitudo,</hi> and
other words of the like nature; there is
nothing disagreeable in them, or dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to Speech; and yet because
they have not been us'd by the best
Classic Authors, but have been seeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
avoided, when they came in their
way, and either paraphras'd, or Greek
words put in their room, they have
been exploded by our Modern Criti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s.
The <hi>Anomalisms</hi> in words have been so
many, and the differences yet more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
those that have treated of them,
that some have gone so far as to deny
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64296:22"/>
the thing it self, and to allow no
Analogy either in the Greek or Latin
Tongue.</p>
               <p>3. Grammar has fared no better in
the constructive part, whether we will
be guided by Rules, or Authority of
Best Authors; the number of Rules is
become a Burthen, and the multitude of
exceptions is yet more vexatious: If we
will believe <hi>Schioppius,</hi> there are five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Rules in our Common Grammars,
in the Syntax only of Nouns and Verbs
and Participles, and scarce any of those
without their exceptions, and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
in the other parts of Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tax;
all which must employ a great part
of our time. Or if we will be directed
by Authorities, the Critics have been so
unmercifully severe, that we scarce know,
which to follow: <hi>Cicero</hi> tho the most
unexceptionable has not escap'd their
censure, he has been pelted by them,
and <hi>Valla</hi> and <hi>Erasmus</hi> have charg'd him
with Soloecisms. <hi>Diutius commorans A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenis
—erat animus ad te scriber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

and <hi>Quum in animo haberem navigandi,</hi>
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Vid. Eras. Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. Dial. Op. Tom. 1. P. 823. v. Valla, L. 1. Cap. 25.</note> are noted passages to this purpose.
And indeed tho <hi>Cicero</hi> be look'd upon
as a Standard of Language with us, yet
he was not so to those of his own Age;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64296:22"/>
                  <hi>Atticus</hi>
                  <note n="p" place="margin">L. 7. Ep. 3.</note> in an Epistle to him, charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
him with false Latin, and being put
upon a vindication, he defends himself
by the authority of <hi>Terence;</hi> so that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<hi>Cicero</hi> be to us, <hi>Terence</hi> was then
the better Authority. Neither of them
sure are unexceptionable, nor any other
that we can meet with, tho we should
carry our search through the whole Set.</p>
               <p>4. Pronunciation has been the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of great Debates, especially in the
Greek Tongue, the pronunciation of
which, has been more neglected: And
tho at first view, it may seem a light
thing, and hardly worth a Debate, yet
the neglect of it, has been of very ill
consequence to that Tongue. For while
the Modern Greeks had little regard to
the powers of their Letters, and mix'd
and confounded the sounds of their
Vowels and Diphthongs, and run most
of them into one, in their pronunciation,
they came at last in many words, to write
as they spoke, which was one great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of the corruption of their Tongue.
This vicious way of speaking was brought
by the exil'd Greeks into <hi>Italy,</hi> and from
thence together with Learning, spread
over the greatest part of <hi>Europe,</hi> till it
met with a check here in <hi>England,</hi> from
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64296:23"/>
two very Eminent Men, both of them
successively Professors in the <hi>Vniversity</hi>
of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> and Sir
<hi>Iohn Cheek.</hi> And because the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
is not much known, and may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
some light to the pronunciation of
the Greek, I will give a brief account
of this Grammatical War.</p>
               <p>It was in the latter end of <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII's
Reign, that <hi>Smith</hi> and <hi>Cheek</hi> began to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the inconveniences in this sort of
pronunciation; they saw that not only the
Beauty of the Language was lost in this
way, but likewise its very Spirit and Life
were gone, by the loss of so many Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
and Diphthongs, and the Language
become <hi>jejune</hi> and languid: In this way
of speaking it, nothing of numerosity
appear'd in the Ancient Orators and
Rhetoricians, nor those flowing Periods,
for which they had been renown'd in
Old <hi>Greece;</hi> neither could they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
shew their Eloquence, in their
Orations or Lectures, for want of the
Beauty and variety of sounds. This put
them upon thinking of a Reformation,
<note n="q" place="margin">V. Chek De ling. Gr. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunt. Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put. cum Steph. Wint. spars. v. Smith De pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nun. Ling. Gr.</note> and having consulted most of the
Ancient Rhetoricians, and other Greek
Authors, who had treated of Sounds
and finding sufficient grounds from
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64296:23"/>
thence for an alteration, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of most of the learned Linguists in
the University, they set about the work,
with some little<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> opposition at first, but
afterwards with success, and almost ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

whom Reformations were not so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
but <hi>Gardiner</hi> succeeding, who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik'd
all Innovations, a stop was put for
some time; This Man assum'd a power,
that <hi>Caesar</hi> never exercis'd, of giving
Law to Words, and having writ to
<hi>Cheek</hi> then Greek Professor to desist from
this new method, which in reality was
the Ancient and true way, and not meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with a suitable compliance, he sends
out an Order in his own name and the
Senate's, which being too long to insert at

               <p>AS Grammar teacheth us to speak
properly, so it is the part of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toric
to instruct, how to do it elegantly,
by adding Beauty to that Language,
that before was naked and Grammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
true. If we would be nice in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing,
there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Rhetoric and Eloquence, tho we
treat of them under the same Head;
the one lays down Rules, the other pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
them, and a Man may be a very
good Rhetorician, and yet at the same
time a mean Orator: Perhaps <hi>Quinctilian</hi>
gives as good Rules as <hi>Cicero,</hi> I am sure
in better method, and with greater
closeness; whereas the other is so much
an Orator, that he cannot forget it,
whilst he acts the part of a Rhetorici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
he dilates and flourishes, and gives
Example instead of Rule: And yet a Man
that would form a comparison betwixt
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64296:25"/>
                  <hi>Quinctilian</hi>'s Declamations, (if yet they be
<hi>Quinctilian</hi>'s) and the Orations of <hi>Tully,</hi>
would be in great danger of forfeiting his
discretion.</p>
               <p>The Ancient <hi>Romans</hi> had Orators a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them and some Eloquence, Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
whereof we have in their History al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
as high as the <hi>Tarquins;</hi> but it was
then a chast thing without Paint or Dress,
Rhetorick was not yet known among
them, the name of it was not so much as
heard of some hundred years after, they
wanting a word to express it by, which
they were afterwards forc'd to borrow
from the Greeks<note n="t" place="margin">Quintil. l. 2. cap. 14.</note>. As soon as it came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, we trace it in its effects, for
as among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> whence it was
borrow'd, it had occasion'd Tumults and
Concussions of State, especially at <hi>Athens</hi>
where it prevail'd most, only <hi>Lacedaemon</hi>
was more quiet, from whence it was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd,
and where a plain Laconic Style
was in vogue, so at <hi>Rome</hi> when once it had
got any footing, and the <hi>Gracchi,</hi> the <hi>Bruti</hi>
and other Demagogues begun to harangue
the People, there was no more Peace in
that State, nothing but continual Broils
and intestine Commotions, till they had
fought themselves out of that liberty
which they seem'd to contend for, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64296:26"/>
their heats ended in the ruine of their
Commonwealth. The Roman Orator
had seen so much of this in his time,
before things were brought to the last
extremity, that he begins his Book of<note n="u" place="margin">De in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. Rhet. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Rhetoric with a doubt, whether that
art had brought greater advantage or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment
to the Common-wealth? And if
an Orator where he is treating of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
were so doubtful in the matter,
we need not be at a loss on which side to
determine the Case.</p>
               <p>To pass by consequences, that are not
justly chargeable on things, which are
generally good or otherwise, according
as the persons are that use them, we
will consider the art it self. If it be an
advantage to any Art, to have been
treated of by Men that are skilful in it,
this Art should have received greater
improvements and be nearer perfection,
than most others, having been conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by one of the greatest Masters that
ever was. <hi>Cicero</hi> has compos'd pretty
large Treatises upon this Subject, that
have been preserv'd and deliver'd down
to us; particularly two<note n="x" place="margin">De O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratore, Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor sive Brutus.</note>, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of which, as he treats of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
kinds, and lays down such Rules, as
are necessary to be observ'd in our way
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64296:26"/>
to Eloquence; so in the latter he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neates
and gives us the Portraiture of a
perfect Orator. I will not pretend to judge
of so great a Master; thus much may be
said with modesty enough, that as in the
first Treatise, the Persons in the Dialogue
differ from one another; so in the latter
the Orator seems to differ from himself;
the first he is doubtful, in the latter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable:
In his Dialogue, (which
has so much the face of probability, that
some among the Learned have mistaken
it for a real Conference). The Persons
introduc'd are equally Great, and argue
and discourse with equal Learning, and
he having assign'd no part to himself, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistently
with his doubtfulness in this
matter, a Man may sometimes be at a loss,
which side to close with. And his <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
is too great and inimitable an example,
perfectly imaginary, and consequently of
no use in humane life, for which Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
is design'd. He himself gives him
only an Ideal Being, and owns that he is
no where to be found but in the concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of our mind.</p>
               <p>And indeed we must not expect to
find him any where else, if all those
things be necessary to an Orator, that
he seems to require. For first, <hi>Nature</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:64296:27"/>
and <hi>Genius</hi> are indispensibly necessary,
without which the wheels being clog'd
and under force, will drive heavily; our
Orator must have a flowing invention to
furnish him with Ideas, a strong imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to impress them, a happy memory
to retain, and a true judgment to dispose
them in their due rank and order. He
must have Law, to lead him into the
knowledge of the Constitution and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
of his Country, History to acquaint
him with examples, Logic to supply him
with proper <hi>Topics,</hi> and morality to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
him to penetrate into, and apply to
the Manners and Passions of Men, the
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which are the Springs of
Action, and sources of Perswasion: In
short, being to treat of every thing, he
must be ignorant of nothing. He must
be in <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Language, a <hi>Wiseman,</hi>
that is a Man of universal knowledge,
and what is more a Paradox, he must
likewise be a <hi>Good Man;</hi> a Quality that
so rarely accompanyed Heathen Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
that both <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Quinctilian</hi>
are much at a plunge in asserting it to the
<hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Orators. He must not
only have a general knowledge of things,
but must have skill in adorning them, he
must have the greatest Art, and yet at the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64296:27"/>
same time the skill to conceal it, for when
ever Art appears, it loseth its effect, and
nothing can please, much less perswade,
but what is natural. The most external
things are necessary to his accomplishment,
he must not only have Eloquence in his
words, but likewise in his looks, decent
motions, and an air of perswasion, that
graceful action and pronunciation, which
<hi>Demosthenes</hi> made the first and second and
third thing, and which had so great a share
in his own Composures, that we are not
to wonder, that his Orations please less in
the reading, than they did in the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
as wanting three parts of what
they had when they were spoke.</p>
               <p>These being the qualifications that
are necessary to a compleat and perfect
Orator, it is next to impossible, there
should ever be any such Man. If any
such were, in whom all these conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
met, it must have been he who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
them, I mean <hi>Cicero,</hi> who had
the happiest <hi>Genius,</hi> and that cultivated
with the greatest Art and Industry, that
perhaps ever Man had; he whom <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctilian</hi>

of <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> the sweetness of <hi>Isocrates,</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:64296:28"/>
and the <hi>Copia</hi> of <hi>Plato;</hi> he whom he stiles
the name not of a Man, but of Eloquence
it self, and gives it as a Rule, by which a
Man may judge of his own Proficiency in
Eloquence, if <hi>Cicero</hi> begins to please him:
yet this <hi>Cicero</hi> was so far from pleasing
in his own Age, that as he met with
Detractors among his Enemies, one of
which compos'd a Treatise<note n="z" place="margin">Largi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Licinius ap Gell. l. 1. 17. cap.</note> against
him, under a very disparaging title, so
he did not satisfie <hi>Brutus</hi> among his
Friends, who taxeth him with loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in his composures, and charges him
with want of Nerves and Strength.
And <hi>Quinctilian</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">L. 12. cap. 1.</note> where he comes to
explain himself tells us, that he stiles
<hi>Cicero</hi> a Compleat Orator only in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
meaning of the word, for in the strict
sense, he was yet to seek, and does not
only desire perfection in him, but acquaints
us with the faults he was charged with
<note n="b" place="margin">L. 12. cap. 10.</note> to wit, that he was turgid and swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in his Expressions, too frequent in
repetitions, broken in his Composition, and
not only easie in his Stile, but soft. In
the last Age, and when Learning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to revive, and <hi>Cicero</hi> was study'd
almost to the neglect of our Bibles, yet
one of our Great Critics in the Latine
Tongue, could never be reconcil'd to a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64296:28"/>
                  <hi>Ciceronian</hi> Stile, nor could hear him read
<note n="c" place="margin">Certe Linacer—Ciceronis dictionem nunquam probare potuit nec sine fastidio audire. V. Gard. Epist. ad Chek. p. 176.</note> without weariness and somewhat of
loathing.</p>
               <p>It is not yet agreed among the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which of his Composures are the
most Elegant, otherwise it were easier
to know where to make our Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> brings his
Oration for <hi>Labienus,</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">P. 313.</note> (whom by an
errour very pardonable among so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
excellencies he mistakes for <hi>Ligarius</hi>)
as an Instance of the power of humane
Eloquence. It must be confest this is
a remarkable instance; here was the
Greatest Orator and the Greatest Judge,
(for <hi>Caesar</hi> is allowed by <hi>Cicero</hi> to be one
of the most Eloquent Persons of his time)
<hi>Caesar</hi> comes into the place of Judicature,
breathing revenge against <hi>Ligarius,</hi> and
with an obstinate resolution to condemn
him, but with difficulty is prevail'd with
to hear <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Defence, which he
gives way to, rather as a thing of meer
form, than with any thoughts of yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his perswasion: However, no
sooner is he heard, but he moves and
affects, and when he comes to touch
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64296:29"/>
upon <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> the Conqueror has no
more Soul left, he takes fire and is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported
beyond himself, he shakes and
trembles, and drops the Paper that he
held in his hand, and in spite of all his
resolutions, absolves the Criminal, whom
he was determin'd to condemn. And
now I think I have allow'd enough to
Eloquence; but to deal impartially, the
force of it is so great, and the effect of
it so wonderful in this Instance, that
it would raise a Mans curiosity to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into the Cause. Had this Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
been lost, we should have had most
terrible Out-cries, and lamentable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
among the Learned, of the loss
that the world has sustain'd in so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate
a piece. Lo it is yet extant!
and altho this, as every thing of <hi>Cicero</hi>'s,
be excellent in its kind, yet so much
will be granted, that it may be read
without rapture and amazement.</p>
               <p>But granting as much force to Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
as can be desir'd, how is it, it
it does perswade, in this and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances?
I am sure not from rational ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
which ought to be the proper
means of convincing a reasonable Man,
but from quite different motives and
<hi>Topics</hi> of perswasion: <hi>Caesar</hi>'s deliberate,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64296:29"/>
and perhaps most reasonable resolution,
was, not to pardon so great a Criminal,
an implacable wretch, that had afterwards
a hand in the Blood of his Deliverer.
The Orator does not so much seek to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
him of the unreasonableness of
the thing, as endeavour to prevail with
him from other inducements, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
to his passions instead of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
his weak and blind side, by putting
him in mind of the <hi>Pharsalian</hi> Field, of
his glory in subduing, and the greater
honours he had acquir'd by pardoning; he
stiles him <hi>Father,</hi> tho at the same time he
thought him an Usurper, and bids him
remember it was his People that beg'd
<hi>Ligarius</hi> of him, and that he could not do
a more popular thing, than by yielding to
their requests and giving way to his usual
Clemency. Such are the Topics that are
brought from Rhetoric! The truth of it
is, our common Eloquence is usually a
cheat upon the Understanding, it deceives
us with appearances, instead of things,
and makes us think we see reason, whilst
it is tickling our sense: Its strongest proofs,
do often consist in an artificial turn of
words, and beautiful expressions, which
if unravel'd, its strength is gone and the
reason is destroyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:64296:30"/>There are few that read <hi>Seneca,</hi> that
do not imagine, he writes with great
force and strength, his thoughts are
lofty, almost every line in him is a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and every Sentence does seem a
Reason, and yet it has been well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,
by a Master in the Art of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<note n="e" place="margin">Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branch. Recherch. Par. 3. l. 2. ch. 4.</note>, who has taken some pains in
unravelling some of his loftiest expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
that there is little more in him
at the bottom, than a Pomp of Words.
And the same observation is made there,
upon two other Authors, the one of
whom is not so proper to be mentioned,
the other is not worth the mention:
All of them are known, and are as
much quoted, and will go as far in
popular discourses as Authors of closer
thought.</p>
               <p>It is not enough to say, that this is
the fault of these Authors and not of
Eloquence, for its end being to perswade,
and the persons whom we are to deal
with, being usually the People, who as
they are the most, are not generally the
wisest, if we would perswade them,
we must suit our selves to their capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities,
otherwise we must be content to
lose our end. An apposite Similitude
is argument with them, and a quaint
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64296:30"/>
saying will go farther than a substantial
Reason, for being guided by Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they are most affected with sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
resemblances, and not having capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
to penetrate into things, that which
is easiest and lies uppermost perswades
them most: So that unless we could
make them wise, they will be easie and
credulous, and will be lead by appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
instead of Truth. And this is one
reason, why Eloquence could never
flourish, at least not arrive to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
height, unless it were among
a people, that had understandings above
the ordinary size, such as the <hi>Athenians</hi>
once were, and afterwards the <hi>Romans:</hi>
And for the same reason it is, that the
wisest Men are not always the best O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators,
either at the <hi>Bar</hi> or in the <hi>Chair,</hi>
for they are too much above the People's
level, their Artillery shoots over, and
it is no wonder if they miss their aim.
And if it be yet said, there is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
such a thing as true Eloquence,
that will always have its force with
Wisemen; I grant there is, but besides
that this is to restrain it to a very narrow
compass, Wise Men will be most guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by wise considerations, such as are
grounded upon close Argument and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64296:31"/>
Conclusions, which are more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
the business of Logic than of
Rhetoric and Eloquence.</p>
               <p>Having gone thus far in my reflections,
principally with regard to the Ancient O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators,
it is almost needless to examine the
Moderns; some of their Patrons in other
sorts of Learning, have given up the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
in this; so that if the Ancients are
found to be wanting in perfection, we are
not to expect to find it in the Moderns.
However a Word or two of them. The
<hi>French</hi> have shown most care in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
among whom an Academy has
been erected for the refining their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
the Members whereof have spent
whole days in examining the propriety of
a word, and have been no less accurate
in studying the Beauties and Ornaments
of Speech and Numerosity of their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods:
But I doubt the observation is
true, that whilst they have been so
scrupulously nice, they have run into
the fault of over much accuracy, and
by adding Beauty to their Language
have broken its strength; by spining and
refining it, and giving it too much paint
and flourish, much of its masculine
strength is lost, and I have sometimes
thought, that it boded not well to that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64296:31"/>
Society, that their first Prize of Eloquence
was given to a Woman<note n="f" place="margin">Mad. de Scudery.</note>. It is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a fault in Oratory to be too curious in
the choice of words, a bold Period, tho' a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Rule will please more, than to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in phrase, and a decent negligence is
often a Beauty in expression, as well as
Dress; whereas by being over correct or
always flourishing, our Periods become
either too luscious or too stiff. And yet
tho' some Members of the <hi>French Academy</hi>
have pretty freely censur'd this fault, and
have deservedly laugh'd at some Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that did not only mispend their time
in studi'd Periods, but in avoiding rough
and unsounding words, it is plain some of
their own Brethren have run into the
same fault, and have been curious and
affected in their Style, almost to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of superstition. For what can be
said less of him who compos'd<note n="g" place="margin">M. de Gomber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville v. Hist. Acad. Franc. p. 50.</note> a
large Book in five Volumes, in all which
he declin'd making use of a common and
almost unavoidable word<note n="h" place="margin">Car.</note>, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it did not please him? or did M.
<hi>Vaugelas</hi> employ his time better, who
having undertaken the Translation of
<hi>Quintus Curtius,</hi> no very great perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
spent thirty years in translating
his Author, and yet left it an unfinish'd
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64296:32"/>
work? In which work it is very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
that having left five or six different
Translations in the Margin of his Book, that
which stood first was generally approv'd
of as the best<note n="i" place="margin">ib. p. 213.</note> as containing his first and
natural thoughts, whereas the others were
probably more forc'd and strain'd.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Pelisson</hi> in his History of the
<hi>Academy,</hi> has given us a <hi>Panegyrick</hi> upon
the <hi>French King,</hi> which I suppose is
design'd as a Specimen of <hi>French</hi> Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
and being there in five diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Languages, every Man may read it
in a known Tongue, and be able in some
measure to judge, to what degree of
perfection Oratory has arriv'd among
our Neighbours: Tho' the truth of it is,
the English Translation is wretchedly
mangl'd, and so different from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
sense, that it ceases to be his.
However take it in the Original, I believe
it will not be pretended, that he has
painted out his <hi>Hero,</hi> in such charming
colours, as either <hi>Pliny</hi> has done his
<hi>Trajan;</hi> or <hi>Cicero, Pompey</hi> in one of his
Orations<note n="k" place="margin">Pro lege Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia. Pro Marcel. &amp; Ligar.</note>, or <hi>Caesar</hi> in another. The
<hi>Academies</hi> Rhetoric is yet wanting,
which they have given us an expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of, both in the same History and
in the Preface to their Dictionary. But
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64296:32"/>
that work having cost them forty years,
and a Grammar being in order their next
undertaking, if that likewise should em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
them a proportionable time, their
Rules of Eloquence seem reserv'd for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
and not for us.</p>
               <p>The English as they have not taken the
same pains nor pursu'd the design with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
Industry with their Neighbours, by
erecting Societies for the improvement
of Oratory; so whatever their performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
have been, they have been more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
in their pretensions: For tho' the
<hi>French</hi> have compos'd large volumes upon
this Subject, with much Ostentation, yet I
scarce know of any, that have been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
by the English, whether it be that
there <hi>Genius</hi> inclines them to strength ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than beauty, or that trusting to their
native Force they despise the fineness of
Art. They have indeed been charg'd by
their Neighbours<note n="l" place="margin">V. com. ap. Iourn. Des Scav. An. 65. p. 100.</note> with a sort of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
that is not very charming, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
their discourses generally with
some Prophecy or surprising Story, which
if it were true, is not perhaps so much
to be attributed to their want of skill,
as to their compliance with the humour
of a People, that attend too much to
Prophecies, and are too much affected
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64296:33"/>
with stories: But however, it were
200 years ago, when the observation
was first made, it is otherwise now,
when Oratory after the many changes,
it has undergone, has put on a quite
different Face: tho' even from those fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
alterations, its instability is too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
and would tempt a Man to
think, that in some measure it depends
upon humour, and has not so unmovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a Foundation as might be wish'd.</p>
               <p>For to look back, a very little, in
those dark<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> times, it is not impossible,
that Eloquence was much about that
pitch, the observation would have it,
in a blind age, when Legends were in
fashion, and the People were kept in
Ignorance and led by Wonder; a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
in Religion brought with it
an advancement in Learning, and as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legancy
begun then to be restor'd to the
Latine Tongue, so in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s
Reign, the Writers of that age, seem
to have affected a <hi>Ciceronian</hi> style in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
both in the length of their peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods,
and often by throwing the verb to
the end of the Sentence: The succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Reign degenerated rather than im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd,
when the generality run into
an affected way of writing and nothing
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64296:33"/>
would please, without a fantastick Dress
and jingle of Words. And tho in the
following Reign, this way of writing
was much laid aside yet even then they
larded their Discourses so thick with
Sentences of Greek and Latin, that as
things now are, it would be a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to excuse them from Pedantry. What
sort of Oratory obtain'd in the late times
of Confusion, is well known, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Pulpit: As if the observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Neighbours had been calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
for them, little Similitudes and
odd Examples, and a worse sort of
Cant, was the Eloquence of these times,
which notwithstanding charm'd the
People to that degree, that it hurry'd
them besides themselves, and almost
out of their Wits. And tho Oratory
may be thought to be now at its full
height, and we may flatter our selves,
that nothing can be added to the Strength
and Solidity of those Discourses, that
are published among us almost every
day, upon every Subject; yet I will
not undertake but that somewhat may
be produc'd in the next Age, so much
more perfect, at least more pleasing,
than any thing we yet have, that the
present Eloquence shall be lookt upon by
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64296:34"/>
our Posterity with the same neglect, with
which we now treat the performances of
our Fore-fathers. No doubt, what they
writ, pleas'd their own age, as much as
our most boasted Pieces please now, and
we ought not to be too confident in our
own performances, with dis-regard to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ages; unless we will make our selves
the Standard of Eloquence, and not give
other Men leave to judge of us, as we
have done of those before us.</p>
               <p>I know no reason, why it may not
vary according to times as well as places,
which in the latter case it so evidently
does, That, that which is lookt upon as
Elegant in one Nation, would be laught
at by another People. The Eastern Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are so different from us in their stile,
that could our most Elegant Composures
be understood by them, they would be
thought flat and insipid, they being so
accustomed to Sublime and Lofty Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
that nothing will affect them, but
what is fetch'd from the Sun and
Moon and Stars. And nearer home,
where the difference ought not to be so
considerable, the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> who
have taken such pains, and spent so much
time in polishing their Style, yet charge
one another with imperfections in their
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64296:34"/>
way of writing, and both of them differ
from the <hi>English.</hi> Every Nation can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
faults in their Neighbours, and do
not consider that their Neighbours see the
like faults to blame in them.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of LOGIC.</head>
               <p>LOgic in the Modern phrase is the Art
of thinking, and being designed
for a help or Instrument of Reason, its
very nature implies weakness in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding;
and therefore we ought not
to value our selves too much upon our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
in giving subtle Rules and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out Logical Arguments, since it would
be more perfection not to want them.
God Almighty who sees all things intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
does not want these helps, he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
stands in need of Logic, nor uses it;
but we whose understandings are short,
are forc'd to collect one thing from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and in that process we seek out pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>Mediums,</hi> and call in all other helps
that may be subservient to Reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:64296:35"/>There was little considerable done in
this matter before <hi>Aristotle,</hi> (for the <hi>Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic</hi>
Logic was only an Art of Wrangling,
as the <hi>Academic,</hi> was of doubting) He
was the great advancer of this Art, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that ever since his time, the main
grounds of reasoning have been borrow'd
from him, even by those that have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spis'd
him. But as nothing can be begun
and perfected together, so his Logic has
been charg'd with several defects; for
whereas all Logic is properly reduceable
to the four principal operations of the
Mind, the two first of these, have been
handled by <hi>Aristotle</hi> very perfunctorily,
to say no worse, and of the fourth he has
said nothing at all: Most of his time has
been spent upon the third operation, of
which he has treated so largely, that his
Logic is in effect, an Art of Syllogizing.
In this he glories as his own invention,
and has been so much valu'd upon it by
some, that it has been stil'd by a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Author,<note n="m" place="margin">Rapin. Reflex sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la log. p. 375.</note> 
                  <hi>the greatest effort of
humane Wit.</hi> But tho the Invention be
confessedly extraordinary, to reduce our
vague thoughts and loose reasonings,
that are almost infinite to certain Rules,
and make them conclude in <hi>Mode</hi> and <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure;</hi>
yet whosoever considers the nature
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64296:35"/>
of a Syllogism, in how many things it
may be false in the Matter and peccant in
Form, That not only the <hi>Terms</hi> and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
must answer to one another,
but must be adapted to the notions of
things, and that these two are hard to be
connected; whilst every little slip in a
Proposition or Ambiguity in a word can
spoil the Syllogism, will have a less opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of its conclusiveness and will find
it a hard thing, to bind any Syllogism so
close upon the mind, as not to be evaded
under some plausible distinction.</p>
               <p>Another Modern<note n="n" place="margin">Bacon. Nov. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. p. 50, 132.</note> I am sure had
this opinion of the matter, for which
reason he thought it necessary to seek out
another sort of Logic.</p>
               <p>I only hint at the principal operations
of the Mind, for if I should descend to less
particulars, there are few things in <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi>
that have not been excepted against
by Modern Authors; some of whom
have gone so far as to question the genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ineness
of his Books, because forsooth,
they cannot discover in them that <hi>Flumen
Orationis,</hi> that <hi>Cicero</hi> speaks of. But tho
there can be no sufficient ground to think
them spurious, notwithstanding better ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
have been brought to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
by an Eminent Philosopher of these
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64296:36"/>
later ages<note n="o" place="margin">Pic. Mirand. Tom. 2. p. 668, &amp;c.</note>, yet we have too much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to believe they were much corrupted,
from <hi>Strabo</hi>'s<note n="p" place="margin">V. lib. 13.</note> account of their having
been mutilated and consumed with moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
by being buried so long under
ground in <hi>Greece</hi> after <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s death;
and after they were brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> by
having been again mangled by ignorant
Transcribers: So that it is hard to know,
how much we have of <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Logic in use among the <hi>Romans</hi>
was rather a sort of Rhetoric than Logic,
in which sense it is generally to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
where we meet with mention of it
among them: It was first borrowed from
the <hi>Stoics,</hi> who were in vogue at <hi>Rome,</hi>
before <hi>Aristotle</hi> was much known there;
and their Logic having been rather Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
than Solid, as consisting much in
pomp of words, and in giving plausible
colours to improbable things, was best
fitted to that People, who were little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
concerned for that Art, than as it
was of use in point of Eloquence. And
tho <hi>Cicero</hi> takes in <hi>Aristotle,</hi> especially in
the <hi>Topical</hi> part, that has most affinity with
Rhetoric, yet it is plain, he has like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
followed the <hi>Stoics,</hi> tho it was not
reputable enough to be own'd. What
the <hi>Romans</hi> have done upon this Sbuject
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64296:36"/>
is not worth much notice, having had
little occasion to make use of this Art, and
what they have of it to purpose being bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
from <hi>Aristotle;</hi> the active Life was
their business, and disputing never seems
to have been much in fashion with them.</p>
               <p>However when <hi>Cicero</hi> begun to revive
in these later Ages, this sort of Logic was
again attempted; the Men of nice Palates
could not relish <hi>Aristotle,</hi> as he was drest
up by the <hi>Scholemen,</hi> and were so madly
struck with <hi>Cicero,</hi> that they thought all
sort of Learning was to be borrow'd
from his Stores! <hi>Cicero</hi> is drawn in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
his Province, and his <hi>Topics</hi> ransack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to frame a Logic: But tho these Men
were extraordinary Persons, yet nothing
shows more plainly, how necessary it is
for Men to keep within their proper
bounds; For when they come to treat of
this matter, it is so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oreign and unweildy
in their hands, that they make very or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
work: They bring indeed some
plausible objections against <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and
so far they are within their proper Sphere,
but when they should lay down some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
new of their own, they either offer
nothing, or what they do, is so unsuccess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
as only to show that they are out of
their Element, and that Logic is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64296:37"/>
their Talent. I speak this of the first
Reformers of Learning, for tho <hi>Ramus</hi>
run in with them, in his opposition to
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> yet he has out-done them in this,
that he himself has given us a plausible
<hi>Systeme;</hi> (For I cannot look upon <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>'s
performance to be so much) which
tho it was much Read and Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on, upon its first appearing in the
World, yet seems now to be dis-regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and in the next Age may probably be
forgot.</p>
               <p>My <hi>Lord Bacon</hi> saw clearer into the
defects of this Art, than most Men did,
and being neither satisfied with the
vulgar Logic, nor with its Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that were made, suitably to his
vast and enterprizing <hi>Genius,</hi> attempted
a Logic wholly new, the Plan of which
is laid down in his <hi>Novum Organum.</hi>
The way of Syllogizing seem'd to him
very fallacious and too dependent upon
words, to be much reli'd on, his search
was after things, and therefore he
brought in a new way of arguing from
<hi>Induction,</hi> and that grounded upon Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
and Experiments: Tho this
Plan as laid down by him, looks liker
an <hi>Vniversal Art,</hi> than a distinct Logic,
and the design is too great and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64296:37"/>
too large to be made by one
Man, or any Society of Men in one
Age, if at all practicable: For whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
opinion he might have of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusiveness
of this way, one cross cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
in an Experiment, would as
easily overthrow his <hi>Induction,</hi> as an
ambiguous word would disorder a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logism,
and a Man needs only make
tryal, in any part of natural History,
as left us by my <hi>Lord Bacon,</hi> to see,
how conclusive his <hi>Induction</hi> was like to
have been. To say nothing, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
his blaming the Common
Logics, as being too much spent in
words, himself runs into the fault, that
he condemns; for what else can we make
of his <hi>Idola Tribûs, Idola Specûs, Fori, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atri;</hi>
or of his <hi>Instantiae Solitariae, migran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
Ostensivae, Clandestinae, Constitutiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> &amp;c.
but fine words put to express very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and ordinary things?</p>
               <p>After the way of free thinking had
been laid open by my <hi>Lord Bacon,</hi> it
was soon after greedily follow'd, for the
Understanding affects Freedom as well
as the Will, and Men will pursue liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
tho' it ends in Confusion. The <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesians</hi>
have been observ'd to be no
friends to Logic, their Master has left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64296:38"/>
extant upon that Subject, except
some scatter'd expressions; unless a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
of method must be interpreted a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic,
which notwithstanding is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
metaphysical. One of his first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Reasoning, after he had doubted
of every thing, seems to be too circular to
be safely built upon, for he is for proving
the Being of a God from the truth of our
Faculties, and the truth of our Faculties
from the Being of a God; he had better
have suppos'd our Faculties to be true, for
they being the Instruments that we make
use of in all our proofs and deductions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
we suppose them to be true, we are at
a stand, and can go no farther in our proofs:
So that the way of supposing seems to be
more rational than that of doubting.</p>
               <p>The notion of perceiving things by
<hi>Ideas</hi> is of a piece with this, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
plausible it might seem when first
started, after it came to be examin'd
Men's <hi>Ideas</hi> about the same objects hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to be so vastly different, and that
in things that were the most clearly and
distinctly perceiv'd, that it was a great
prejudice against this opinion. There
are few of the first started Ideas, that
have not been examin'd, and many of
them effectually confuted, by the late
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64296:38"/>
Improvers of this way, and other Ideas
substituted in their room, which have giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
no more satisfaction to others, than the
first did to them: and till we can agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
some Rule or Standard, by which to
measure and adjust our Ideas, it is only a
loose way of thinking, and there can be
no end of Controversie this way: Altho'
there be little hopes of this, whilst we have
reason to believe, that nothing pleaseth
more in this way, than the liberty it
gives, or which every Man takes of
framing new and fine <hi>Ideas.</hi> I am no
enemy to free thinking, yet I must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
wish, we might proceed by some
Rule, (for a Rule is no Bar but a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of freedom) otherwise I am sure,
there is no agreement to be expected,
and it is to be feared we shall end in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.
Clear and distinct perception
has been given us for a Rule, and the
conformity of our Ideas with the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of things has been given as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but it is no good proof of either,
that Men have differ'd much in some
of those things, that have been suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to be the most clearly perceiv'd,
and most agreeably to the nature of
things. The great difficulty is, in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
that Conformity, or in clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64296:39"/>
and distinguishing our thoughts;
for every Man's Ideas are clear to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>It would be lookt upon as an omissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to pass by the <hi>Art of thinking</hi> suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to be writ by <hi>M. Arnault</hi>
                  <note n="q" place="margin">L' Art de pens. Par. 68.</note>. The best
part of it must be own'd to be borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from <hi>Aristotle,</hi> only be cloathing
old <hi>Terms,</hi> under new <hi>Ideas,</hi> which
shows that it is not so easie to frame a
new Logic as a new Philosophy, and
gives a ground of suspicion, that this
Philosophy is not at perfect amity with
reason, otherwise they might more
easily be adapted to one another. One
thing upon which this Author values
himself is, his substituting useful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
in the place of those trivial
common ones formerly in use with the
old Logicians, which he makes an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to the old way: But can it be
an objection to any thing, that it is
suited to the end, for which it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd?
the use of Instances is to illustrate
and explain a difficulty, and this end is
best answered by such Instances as are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
and common: whereas the Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which this Man brings, are usually
taken from other Sciences, and suppose
Men to be wise already, contrary to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64296:39"/>
the intention of Logic, which is only
an introduction to other Sciences, and
being fitted for Beginners, supposeth
our knowledge to be yet weak, and is
design'd for an Instrument to help us
forward. And yet there is a worse ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
against his Instances, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them being borrow'd from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound
and corrupt Divinity, they can
hardly be read by Beginners without
danger of being corrupted: For such
false Opinions are never more conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
than when they are held forth
to us under such plausible appearances,
nor are their impressions ever like to be
more lasting, than when they are suckt
in with the principles of Reason. I will
not say, that these opinions are sown
there on purpose, that they might grow
up with our Reason, but where so much
Divinity is mixt with our Logic, it
is very suspicious that it has a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>The last Systeme of Logic that I have
met with, is the <hi>Medicina Mentis</hi> which
has been esteemed the Best, and, for
ought I know, may maintain that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
till a new one appears: It is not
safe to censure an Author of so estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
a reputation, only thus much a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64296:40"/>
Man may venture to say, That it seems
to be too strong Physic for most Men's
Constitutions, and it looks so like a
Mountebank to boast of Infallible Cures
<note n="r" place="margin">Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin. Ment. Praef.</note> that I could not but have a less o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of this Author. He makes light
account of the former Logicians; and
Perception which was thought to be so
clear a mark of truth, is shown by him
to be often the effect of Imagination,<note n="s" place="margin">Ib. Par. 2. p. 43.</note>
and therefore he fetcheth his <hi>Criterion</hi>
higher, which he placeth in <hi>Conception,</hi>
or a yet higher degree of Cogitation.
But whether knowledge be grounded in
Perception or <hi>Conception</hi> seems not very
material, provided they could s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ow us
the way, how to find it: This is what
we desire; and the telling us, we must as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to nothing, of which we have not
a <hi>Conception,</hi> does not seem to further
our search over much. It serves well
to another purpose, to show us the
shortness of our Reach, for if we must
assent to nothing without <hi>Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
we must needs know very little,
there being few things, that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
perfectly. I am apt to think
Mr. <hi>T.</hi> has borrow'd some Hints from
this Author, tho' he has apply'd them
to purposes, the Author never meant,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64296:40"/>
and indeed flatly disavows: For the
Author seems to mean well, only is
too fanciful a Man, to make an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Logician, and whoever reads
his <hi>Medicina Corporis</hi> will be confirmed
in this opinion: If his Rules of Reason
be not better suited to the mind, than his
Rules for Health are fitted to our

               <head type="sub">Of Moral Philosophy.</head>
               <p>MOrality may be consider'd two
ways, as an Habit, or a Rule;
either as it is in us, 'or as an Art for
the conduct of Life and a Doctrine of
Manners: In both respects, it is very
imperfect, if consider'd only in its own
strength, and without the assistances of
Revelation; Philosophy being as unable
to give Rules, as nature is to practise
them. Most of the Philosophers and
some of grosser capacities were sensible
of this, they were so far bewildred in
their search after Happiness, as to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to perceive their own wandrings,
and could feel the disorders of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
But how to return into the way,
or remedy these disorders was beyond
their Power.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:64296:43"/>
                  <hi>Socrates</hi> was the first, who, after the
Philosophers had tir'd themselves out in
the search of nature, with little success,
observing the great uncertainties and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of such enquiries, brought down
Philosophy from fruitless Speculations, to
the uses of Life: His Opinions in Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
were clearer and much better ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
than those of most of the succeeding
Sects; having had truer notions of God,
of the Immortality of the Soul and future
Rewards, than the rest had, without
which all Vertue is a floating unstable
thing, wanting both its due end and
sufficient foundation. But though he was
clearer than most of the rest were, yet he
expresseth himself too doubtfully, to be
depended on: Most of his Philosophy is
in broken Sentences, deliver'd with much
doubtfulness, and his dying Words are
well known, when he had least to fear,
which are so full of Diffidence, that
they can give little encouragement to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to follow him. He proposeth his
Sense, as a probable Opinion, of the truth
whereof, he had conceiv'd good hopes,
from its agreeableness with the Divine
Goodness, and the order of Providence;
rather than built upon such solid Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
as would give assurance, and bear
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64296:44"/>
Men up in the discharge of their Duty,
where it meets with Reproaches and
Discouragements, the usual attendants of
Vertue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> does little more than Copy from
his Master, and being aw'd by his hard
Fate, speaks yet with more reserve; his
most Divine Dialogue, is chiefly a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Socrates</hi>'s Opinions, and an account
of the Discourses he had with his Scholars,
sometime<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before he died<note n="t" place="margin">V. Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. Phae. don.</note>. And both the
<hi>Socratic</hi> and <hi>Platonic</hi> way having been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
to dogmatizing, and rather doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and denying than asserting any thing;
we are not to expect certainty, where it
is not pretended to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aristotle</hi> is more noted for his order,
in bringing Morality into Systeme, by
treating of Happiness under Heads; and
ranging it in Classes according to its dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Objects, and distinguishing Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
into their several kinds, which had
not been handled Systematically before,
than for any real improvement he made
in this sort of knowledge: which was
a diviner thing in <hi>Plato</hi>'s Dialogues,
although only Lax and Moral Discourses,
than it was under all the advantages,
that <hi>Aristotle</hi> could give it, by reducing
it into order; whilst he wanted the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64296:44"/>
only thing, that could render it ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>As for the rest of the Philosophers,
they generally go upon false Principles,
That Sect of them, which was strictest
in its Institution, and pretended to the
greatest Perfection, the <hi>Stoics,</hi> were more
extravagant than most others were:
Their Rule was to live up to Nature,
which as they understood it, was to divest
themselves of Hum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nity; for that was to
be laid aside, and an absolute unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
to be embrac'd, in order to the
happiness, they were to be possess'd of;
Their Wiseman was to be Rich and
Powerful, and every way Happy in the
midst of Torments: All good with them
was equal and alike; only their Wiseman
was somewhat above the Gods<note n="u" place="margin">V. Senec. Ep 53. Est aliquid quo Sapiens antecedat Deum.</note> In
short their Philosophy was all Paradox,
it made a great show, and dazled those
that look'd no farther than appearance,
but was nothing more at the bottom,
than an Ostentation of Wisdom.</p>
               <p>It were tedious to recount the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Opinions of the Heathen Moralists,
which in short compass of time, were
grown so numerous, that it gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to the <hi>Sceptics,</hi> to dispute the Truth
of all, and to maintain that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64296:45"/>
true or false, good or evil; and
consequently to place their happiness
in a perfect <hi>indifference,</hi> an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the
understanding: and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the will
<note n="x" place="margin">V. Sext. Empiric. l. 1. c. 12.</note>. This was to go beyond the <hi>Stoics,</hi>
who, as they could feel no pain, so these
Romantic Heroes could taste Happiness
without being affected with Pleasure.
Their Master <hi>Pyrrhon,</hi> who flourished a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the time of <hi>Zeno,</hi> was so struck with
this Principle, that if a Chariot or wild
Beast came in his way, he scorn'd to turn
aside, and must often have perished, had
he not been preserv'd by his Friends. He
was best answered by the Dog in <hi>Dioge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
Laertius</hi>
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Lib. 9. vit. Pyr. rhon.</note> which coming upon
him by surprise, ere the Philosopher had
time to consider, made nature start back,
and the Philosopher confess that such ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
principles will not hold.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Varro</hi>'s time the different Opinions
were so extravagantly multipli'd, that
in his Book of Philosophy<note n="z" place="margin">V. Aug. de Civ. Dei l. 19. c. 1.</note>, he reckons
up two hundred and eighty eight several
Opinions, only concerning the <hi>Summum
Bonum.</hi> And if the difference were so
great concerning the ultimate end, which
all Men desire, and in which, if any
thing, the common sense of mankind
should seem to agree; we may easily
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64296:45"/>
imagine what agreement there was, in
other less Ends and particular Duties. I
need not show it, it is a common Theme,
and may be seen in every Treatise of
Morality.</p>
               <p>But tho Morality may have been very
imperfect amongst the Philosophers, it
is otherwise, I suppose with us, who have
better light and a surer Rule for our dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
than they had: It is true it is so,
whilst we keep to our Rule, but when
we forsake that, we go astray like other
Men. Our Modern Casuists, especially
the Jesuits, afford too clear an evidence of
this, who by starting nice Cases and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophizing
upon them, have brought us
back in some things to the state of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers;
they have already given us a
new Notion of Philosophical Sin, which
as stated by them has no such sting in it,
as to deter most Men from its Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Their Theses are Printed, that were
to be maintain'd by the Jesuits at <hi>Dijon,</hi>
the first of which is, <hi>Peccatum Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum
seu morale, est Actus humanus discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniens
naturae Rationali &amp; Rectae Rationi;
Theologicum vero &amp; mortale est transgressio
libera legis Divinae: Philosophicum quantum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis
grave, in illo qui Deum vel ignorat, vel
de Deo actu non cogitat, est grave Peccatum,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64296:46"/>
sed non est offensa Dei, neque Peccatum mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tale
dissolvens amicitiam Dei, neque aeternâ
poenâ dignum:</hi> A Thesis indeed very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
to the Heathen Philosophers, but
impossible to be reconciled to the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the Gospel. It has been reprinted
at the <hi>Hague</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Nouv. Her. dans la moral. Ala Haye 89.</note>, and sufficiently answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and expos'd by a good hand, tho no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can expose it more than naming it.</p>
               <p>This is only one of their Casuistical
Decisions, a large Collection of which
may be had in the <hi>Iesuits Morals</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Morale des Ies. A Mons. 1667.</note>,
which as represented by a Doctor of the
<hi>Sorbonn,</hi> and he quotes their own licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Authors, is such a System of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
as the Heathen Philosophers would
blush to own. According to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of that <hi>Morale,</hi> how many sins
are there, that may be committed, and
what Duties that may not be evaded in
some degree, or under some distinction?
Their one Doctrine of <hi>Probability,</hi> is
a ground of as much liberty, as an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
sinner can desire; for if a Man
may act upon a probable Opinion, and
an Opinion becomes then probable,
when it is supported by one Reason, or
maintained only by one Doctor<note n="c" place="margin">V. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>l p. 148, 158.</note>, I
will venture to affirm, there are few
things so hard in morality, that have
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64296:46"/>
been defended by the loosest Moralists,
that have not been maintain'd by some
of the Jesuits, as cited in that Book. And
yet this is not the utmost liberty, these
nice Casuists and Indulgent Fathers have
allow'd; they go farther, and where
there are two probable Opinions, a Man
may act upon that which is less proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
nay he may venture upon an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that is only probably probable;
which is certainly as low a degree of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,
as can well be imagin'd; and I
do not see, how they can go lower, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
they would allow a Man to act upon
an Opinion that is improbable.</p>
               <p>It might have been expected, that
where so many hard Opinions have been
charg'd upon the Jesuits, as have been
produc'd in the <hi>Iesuits Morals,</hi> they
should say somewhat in their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence:
Somewhat indeed they have said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and one of the Pleas they insist upon
most is, that many of the same Opini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons
are maintain'd by the Scholemen,
some of whom were canoniz'd, and
their Books generally receiv'd in the
Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> But whatever Opinion
they may have of such a defence, it is
nothing to us, who bring the same
charge against the Scholemen, that we
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64296:47"/>
do against the Jesuits, as far as they
maintain the same Opinions, and we
think them the more dangerous, if they
have not only been defended by Jesuits,
but by such Men, as by having been
receiv'd into the Catalogue of Romish
Saints, have in a manner canonized
their Opinions, by being canoniz'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and made their Church in some
measure answerable for them: Tho to
do that Church right, others of her Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
have taken offence at such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
particularly the <hi>Iansenists;</hi> and
among the Benedictines, Father <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>billon,</hi>
tho otherwise reserv'd enough in
his Censures, yet where such loose Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suists
come in his way, cannot forbear
giving them a lash, and declaring it his
Opinion, that a Man may read <hi>Tully</hi>'s <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi>
with more profit than he can do cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Casuists<note n="d" place="margin">Etud. monast. Par. 2. c. 7.</note>: which tho smart e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
as coming from a modest humble
Man, yet another Frenchman has said a
severer thing, where he defines Morality
as treated by the Casuists, <hi>L' art de chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaner
avec Dieu;</hi> and indeed in their way
of handling, it looks liker an Art to ease
Men from the Burden of rigorous Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
by showing them the utmost
bounds they may go without Sin, than
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64296:47"/>
what it should be, a direction for the ease
of tender Consciences, by shewing Men
their duty in particular Cases.</p>
               <p>To speak the whole matter in one
word, a good Conscience and an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Man will see his duty with only
a moderate share of Casuistical skill, but
into a perverse heart, this sort of wisdom
enters not: It is usually some lust to
be gratified or danger to be avoided,
which perverts the Judgment in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
Duties, but were Men as much
affraid of sin as they are of danger, there
would be few occasions of consulting our
Casuists.</p>

               <p>PHysical knowledge taking in the
whole Compass of Nature, is too
vast a subject to be comprehended by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Mind; it is an unexhaustible Mine,
wherein we may always dig and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come at the bottom: For tho the
things it treats of be material Objects, and
as such sensible and easie, yet when we
come to treat of them in a Philosophical
manner, they shun our Sense, and are
liable to equal difficulties, with nicer
matters. There is nothing more common
in nature, than Matter and Motion, or
more easily distinguish'd, but then we
must understand them to be so only in
their grosser meaning, for if we speak of
subtle Matter and <hi>intestine</hi> Motion, they
escape the nicest scrutiny of Sense: And
yet these are the secret Springs of most of
the operations in nature, and as for gross
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64296:48"/>
matter and visible motion, they are rather
of mechanical consideration. A Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
business is to trace Nature in her
inward Recesses and Latent Motions,
and how hid these are, is best known to
those, who are most conversant in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical
Enquiries: Such Men by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deep into her, and observing her in
all her windings and mazes, find matter
enough for Wonder, and reason to adore
the Wisdom of God, but at the same
time only meet with mortification to their
own Wisdom, and are forc'd to confess,
that the ways of Nature like those of God,
are past Man's finding out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aristotle</hi> who has gone so far in his
rational Enquiries, has given us little
insight into Physical Truths; for having
fram'd a Body of Physics out of his own
Head, all the various <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of
Nature were to be suited to his Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
instead of his Philosophy's being
drawn from Observations in Nature:
His reasoning which did well in Logics,
was somewhat out of place, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided
him here, where he was rather
to be led by Observation, and where
he does make observations they are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
unphilosophical, and such as few
Men could be ignorant of: His four E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64296:49"/>
are gross things, and leave the
understanding at the same pitch where it
was, and his three Principles do not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
it much higher; his first Principle
as he has explain'd it, is unintelligible,
and the last of the three is no Principle at
all, unless we will allow that for one Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
that is destructive of another: He
tells us, that all knowledge is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from the Sense, and yet presently
forsakes that, and flies to Reason. But his
Philosophy is enough decry'd already,
and needs not be brought lower than
it is.</p>
               <p>I need not here reckon up the opinions
of other Ancient Philosophers; most of
them have been reviv'd, and have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
confuted, and have dyed the second
time in our own Age: The opinion of
<hi>Thales</hi> and the <hi>Ionic</hi> Sect, in making Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Principle of all things, has been
reviv'd by those, who have attempted to
explicate a Deluge from such an Original:
And the Opinion of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and the
<hi>Italic</hi> Sect, in placing the Sun in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the World, and ascribing motion to
the Earth, has been maintain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d a-new by
<hi>Copernicus</hi> and his Followers; and tho
<hi>Transmigration</hi> of Souls be one of <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi>'s
hardest sayings, yet it has found a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:64296:49"/>
Patron of late in a Countryman of our
own<note n="e" place="margin">Mr. Bulstr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>de.</note>, who has maintain'd it in a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifi'd
Sense, which perhaps was as much
as <hi>Pythagoras</hi> meant. An <hi>Anima Mundi,</hi>
Prae-existence of Souls, with the rest of
<hi>Plato</hi>'s Opinions, have found a strong par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in their defence; and many other late
Opinions, which have little in them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
their novelty to recommend them to
the World, do really want that too, and
might be easily shown, to be only the
Spawn of the Ancient Philosophers; by
whom as there is nothing so absurd, that
has not been said, so they have scarce said
any thing so extravagant, wherein they
have not been follow'd.</p>
               <p>But among all the ancient Opinions,
none have been reviv'd with more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
approbation, than those of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus</hi>
and <hi>Epicurus,</hi> the Founders of
the Atomical or Corpuscular Philosophy;
an ill Omen to Religion, when they who
have explicated the production of the
world, by the Laws of Mechanism with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a God, have been so generally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd.
In this <hi>M. Des Cartes</hi> has been too
successful, whom tho it would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unjust to charge with denial of a
God, whom he supposeh to have crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Matter, and to have impressed the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64296:50"/>
first motion upon it, yet in this he is
blameable, that after the first motion is
impress'd, and the wheels set a going,
he leaves his vast Machine, to the Laws
Mechanism, and supposeth that all things
may be thereby produc'd, without any
further extraordinary assistance from the
first impressor. The supposition is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious,
and as he states it destructive of it
self; for not to deny him his Laws of
motion, most of which have been evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
shown to be false, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so must all be that is built upon them,
his Notion of Matter is inconsistent with
any Motion at all; for as Space and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
are with him the same, upon this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
there can be no <hi>vacuum,</hi> and
there can be no Motion in a <hi>Plenum:</hi>
Motion is only the succession of Bodies
from one place to another, but how
should they succeed from one place, if
there be no room to receive them in the
next, which there cannot be, if all be full?
And the difficulty is still greater upon the
first framing of things, before the subtile
matter is produc'd, that was to suit it self,
to all the little Interstices, betwixt the
larger solid Bodies, which must needs
clog and interfere with one another, unless
we will allow some fluid matter, that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64296:50"/>
will yield and give way to the other's
motions. <hi>M. Des Cartes</hi> imagines he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
all this, by a succession of Bodies in
a Circular Motion; but I think this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
carries its own Confutation with it,
and that nothing can be suppos'd more
absurd, than to imagine, that upon the
motion of every little Atome, the whole
frame of things must be disturb'd and set
a going. Motion is one of <hi>M. Des Cartes</hi>'s
darling Principles, and by this and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
he pretends to solve the greatest dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
that are in Nature, and it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
remarkable, that he has not fail'd more
in any of his Notions, than in these two
great Fundamentals of his Philosophy, for
allowing him these, his other explications
hang together somewhat better. But this
it is to frame <hi>Hypothesis</hi> out of one's own
imagination, without consulting Nature,
which <hi>Mr. Des Cartes</hi> has not done, for
it was equal to him, what <hi>Hypothesis</hi> he
went upon, and had Father <hi>Mersennus</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">V. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin. Reflex. p. 423.</note> told him, that a <hi>vacuum</hi> was as
much in fashion, and as agreeable to
the taste of the Age, as a <hi>Plenum</hi> then
seem'd to be, we should have had an
<hi>Hypothesis</hi> grounded upon a <hi>vacuum,</hi> and
no doubt as specious and plausible, as
that we now have; perhaps more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64296:51"/>
being more consonant to his own
Sense, as having been his first design, and
the other only hammer'd out by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of his Confident <hi>Mersennus:</hi> And
it is a wonderful thing, that Men should
run mad after such an <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> which,
as it has not the least ground in Nature,
so the Author himself never believ'd it.
It has been answer'd and effectually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
in all its Branches, by several hands,
but by none better than the Author of, <hi>A
Voyage to the World of Des Cartes,</hi> which
tho not always conclusive, is every where
ingenious, and confutes him in his own
way, for one Romance is best answer'd
by another.</p>
               <p>But we have been taught to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
betwixt <hi>Hypotheses</hi> and <hi>Theories,</hi> the
latter of which are shrewd things, as
being built upon Observations in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
whereas Hypotheses may be only
Chimaeras: I should be glad to see that
<hi>Theory,</hi> that is built upon such Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.
The most plausible <hi>Theory</hi> I
have yet met with, is only built upon an
Hypothesis, to wit, the Incrustation of
the Earth, and the cracking of its <hi>Cortex,</hi>
the very same in substance we have been
speaking of, and how this <hi>Theory</hi> should
be more certain, than the Hypothesis it
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64296:51"/>
goes upon, is past my understanding.
Thus much I believe may be said of all
our <hi>Theories,</hi> That, however natural
they may seem at first view, they have
always some mark in nature set upon
them, to discover them to be false:
Thus Dr. <hi>B's Theory,</hi> of the Incrustati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Earth is very ingenious, but
then there is no sufficient Provision made,
for Antidiluvian Waters, much less for
Springs and Rivers, which can neither
be generated, nor flow in Streams
without Mountains. Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s <hi>Theory,</hi>
shows a vast reach and depth in it's
Contrivance, both in his accounting for
the formation of things, and in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of a Deluge; But his Paradisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acal
days are so long, by his allowing
only an annual motion to the Earth in that
State, as to exceed all belief; and tho' he
makes a tolerable shift, to supply us with
such stores of Waters, from the <hi>Atmosphere</hi>
of a Comet, as might occasion a Deluge, yet
it is impossible for him to carry them off
again after the occasion is over; and for
ought I can see, they must have continu'd
with us, till the return of his Comet. So
that whatever differences may be alledg'd
betwixt <hi>Hypothesis</hi> and <hi>Theories,</hi> they are
much upon the same level, as to any real
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64296:52"/>
light they have yet afforded to Nature,
and one great difference seems to be this,
that the former are only modestly propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
whereas Theories are usher'd in with
greater assurance. It is well if <hi>Theories</hi> be
not as much out of fashion in the next Age,
as Hypotheses are in this; for so many Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
and Experiments are requir'd to
raise a Theory, that I despair of ever see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
One that will bear the Test.</p>
               <p>When I speak of Observations and
Experiments, I would not be thought
to under-value a Society, which has been
erected to that purpose, and whose
endeavours have been so successfull that
way already: But however successful
they may have been, those excellent
Persons have more modesty, than to
over-rate their own performances, and
nothing has done them more injury,
than the vanity of some few Men, who
have been so <hi>Planet-struck</hi> as to dream
of the possibility of a Voyage to the
Moon, and to talk of making wings to
fly thither, as they would of buying a
pair of Boots to take a journey<note n="g" place="margin">Mr. G's Scep. Sc. p. 134.</note>. The
Genuine Members of that Society have
other thoughts of things, being far from
any hopes of mastering Nature, or of
ever making such progress, as not to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64296:52"/>
leave work enough, for other Men to
do. One of their Number, a great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of their Society, after he had grown
old in these Studies, learnt Modesty and
diffiding thereby, and was never more
reserv'd than in his full growth and
maturity of Knowledge, when he had
least reason to be so. And another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
Person, who has added Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical
skill to his Observation upon
Nature; after the nicest Enquiry, seems
to resolve all into <hi>Attraction,</hi> which, tho' it
may be true and pious withal, perhaps
will not be thought so Philosophical.</p>
               <p>The truth of it is, we may as well
rest there, for after all, Gravitation
was never yet solv'd, and possibly, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
may, and after Men have spent a
thousand years longer in these Enquiries,
they may perhaps sit down at last un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Attraction,</hi> or may be content to
resolve all into the Power or Providence
of God. And might not that be done
as well now? We know little of the
causes of things, but may see Wisdom
enough in every thing: and could we
be content to spend as much time in
contemplating the wise ends of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
as we do in searching into Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
it would certainly make us better
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:64296:53"/>
Men, and I am apt to think, no worse
Philosophers. For tho' Final Causes
have been so much banish'd from our
modern Physics, yet nothing is more
to the purpose, or more easie to be
understood. Whereas Causes are yet
Latent; and it is very remarkable, that
the very last Author,<note n="h" place="margin">M. le Clerc.</note> that has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us a System of Physics, after all the
Discoveries that have been talk'd of,
and Improvements that have been
made in Nature, has been forc'd to
proceed in an <hi>Analytical</hi> method, for want
of Principles to go upon, and instead of
demonstrating Effects from the Causes,
has been forc'd to trace the Causes of
things from their Effects: which tho' it be
some Argument of the Author's Modesty,
yet I do not speak it to commend his
performance, for his Physics are like his
other Works, faulty enough.</p>

that we meet with in Prophane Story<note n="i" place="margin">Cicer. de Divin. l. 1. p. 1.</note>,
that made Observations upon the Stars:
Two reasons might incline them to
this, First, the evenness of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
which afforded a free and open
prospect; and next the opinion they had
of the Stars, whom esteeming as Gods,
it must have been a part of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
to look up to Heaven and observe
them. But then their observations were
principally Astrological, they did not so
much measure the Heavens, as fetch
their directions from thence, and were
more concern'd for the influences of the

Astrology were at its full heighth amongst

The same may be said of most of the

               <p>The two <hi>Hypotheses</hi> of <hi>Ptolemy</hi> and
<hi>Copernicus</hi> will take in most of what
needs be said on this Subject; for as to
that of <hi>Tycho Brahe,</hi> as it is in a great
measure compounded of these two, and
seems design'd to account for difficulties,
in both these Hypotheses, so it is liable to
several Objections in them both.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ptolemaic</hi> Hypotheses has too
much appearance of Art, to be esteemed
natural, all its <hi>Epicycles</hi> and <hi>Eccentries</hi>
and other <hi>Ambages</hi> can never be thought
the Contrivance of Nature, which acts
in a more simple manner, without go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so far about; those solid Spheres
which it supposes have been shatter'd
and overturn'd by the Modern Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
and shown to be inconsistent
both with the <hi>Trajection</hi> of Comets,
and with that equal light, which is
convey'd to us from the Planets and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Stars, which by passing through
such different <hi>Mediums</hi> and Solid Bodies
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64296:54"/>
must have suffered innumerable Refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:
Several of the Phoenomena of
the Heavens admit of no tolerable so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
this way, particularly those of
<hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> and the Access and
Recess of the Polar Star to and from
the Pole, which in the time of <hi>Hippar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
was distant from it 12 Degrees,
but is not now fully three, and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of time will recede from it again
more than ever; and the many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
and likewise opposite motions of
the Stars and Spheres are not easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd.
But nothing is so inconceivable
as the velocity of their motion, for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Hypothesis they must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to move some thousand Miles in a
Minute, which tho' it may be conceiv'd
by Philosophers, is not very obvious to
common understandings. Such are the
Objections that have been commonly
brought against this Hypothesis, which
have rendred it so hard of digestion; and
tho' nothing can excuse the hard saying
of that Prophane King<note n="l" place="margin">Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile.</note> so well known
and so often quoted, yet it may be so far
mollifi'd, that having been level'd against
this Hypothesis, he did not thereby pretend
to correct the Works of God Almighty,
only did not believe them to have been
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:64296:55"/>
fram'd in such a manner by God, as
<hi>Ptolemy</hi> has describ'd.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Copernican Hypothesis</hi> values it self
upon its easiness, and the great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiousness
of the way it goes in: But
tho' it accounts for appearances more
Compendiously than the other does, and
without the vast <hi>Apparatus,</hi> that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
in the <hi>Ptolemaic</hi> Hypothesis, yet
it contains things as incomprehensible
as the other does: For as the celerity
of Motion in the former exceeds all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
so the Regularity of Motion is
unfathomable in this. The Motion of
the Earth is of hard enough digestion
in it self, but supposing it to move in
a fluid <hi>Medium,</hi> who is there that can
imagine, that it should be so regular and
uniform as it is? The fluid with which
it is environ'd and in which it moves,
is unstable, and mutable, consisting of
little Bodies, that are always altering
their position to one another, and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their shapes by constant and mutual
Attrition, and yet tho' the Ambient Fluid
be always altering, the motion is the
same. It describes our days by its Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rnal
Motion upon its own Axis, our years by
its Annual Revolution, and our Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
by that and its Inclination, and all
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64296:55"/>
these so regularly, as not to vary in so
many Successions of Ages, and yet we
must believe that this Constancy and
Regularity is maintained by fluctuating
matter, the most unstable thing in the
world. The exactest Movements or
Machines, that humane Wit can frame,
are Subject to innumerable disorders,
either from the breaking of the Spring of
their Motion, or wearing of their wheels,
or some other external impulse or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
decay, and therefore always want
our care, either to set them right, or
keep them in order; only this vast Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine
and Frame of things, preserves
its Course, and never varies, tho' acted
in appearance by the most unconstant
Causes. A Man that well considers this
will be inclin'd to entertain a more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
opinion of the Ancient Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,
and tho' he cannot believe the
Heavens to be turn'd and acted by <hi>Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences,</hi>
yet he would find it almost as hard
to apprehend, how they move without
them: whatever become of Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
an Intelligent Being must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
be taken in, without which our
Philosophy will be very unable to do the
business.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:64296:56"/>There is another difficulty in this
Hypothesis, which the <hi>Copernicans</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
easily get over, and which will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
any Man's understanding that well
considers it: That the Earth is only a
point in respect to the Universe, tho'
it be a pretty large <hi>Postulatum,</hi> yet pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
must be granted upon any Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis;
but that not only the Earth,
but the whole <hi>Magnus Orbis,</hi> or that vast
Orbit which the Earth describes round
the Sun, should be esteem'd a point,
(without which supposition the <hi>Coper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nican</hi>
Hypothesis cannot be maintain'd)
is such a <hi>Postulatum</hi> in Astronomy, as
the more a Man thinks of, the less easily
he can assent to. For what is this <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
Orbis</hi> or vast Circle which must be
esteem'd as a point? To take only the
Semidiameter of this Circle, or about the
sixth part of the whole, <hi>Hugenius</hi>
                  <note n="m" place="margin">Cosmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theor. p. 124.</note>,
no incompetent Judge of these matters,
has calculated the distance betwixt the
Earth and the Sun to be about 17 Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
German Miles; or in other words,
that supposing a Bullet shot from a Gun
could retain always the same velocity, it
had at its first discharge, with this swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in about twenty five years, it would
pass from the Earth to the Sun: All which
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:64296:56"/>
immense distance is about a sixth part of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernicus</hi>'s
point. It is true, <hi>Hugenius</hi> assigns
a proportionable distance (if there can be
any proportion in such an immensity) to
the fix'd Stars; for this Bullet being shot
again, with the same swiftness, he<note n="n" place="margin">Ib. p. 137.</note> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
it might come at the nearest of the
fixt Stars in about 700 years, which is such
a distance as common apprehensions can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
reach, and will once more require a
Philosophers Understanding.</p>
               <p>In this vast compass, our Astronomers
have discover'd new Worlds (like that
Sanguine Conqueror who was seeking out
New Worlds before the old one was half
subdu'd) every Planet must be a World
and ever Star must have its Planets: this
Project was pursu'd by <hi>M. Fontanelle</hi> in a
pleasing entertaining way, but has been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd
by others with greater seriousness.
What these Worlds are, might as well be
left undetermined, God having thought fit
to say little of them, and having plac'd
them beyond our reach; But if we may
guess at the discoveries that are to be
made in the remotest Stars, from those
that have been made already in the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
the Moon, I do not think they will
make any great addition to knowledge.
It must be confest, that mighty discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64296:57"/>
have been talkt of in that Planet: <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velius</hi>
has given us its Geography, and has
markt out<note n="o" place="margin">Seleno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph. p. 226.</note> every Mountain and Vally,
Sea, and River, as exactly as if he had been
there, in his accurate Map of that World.
<hi>Ricciolus</hi>
                  <note n="p" place="margin">Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest. p. 204.</note> has gone a little farther, and
has assign'd every Astronomer his propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ground; you may there meet with
the Land of <hi>Copernicus, Galilaeus</hi> and
<hi>Kepler;</hi> and it is but just that they should
have the benefit of their Invention:
And the same Author to show his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
has plac'd <hi>Ricciolus</hi> in the best
and most Conspicuous spot of Ground in
that World. But are these Men in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest?
Or do we yet know where we
are? That the Moon is an Opake Body
is no new discovery, the nature of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipses
has long since shewn it, and I am
affraid it is little we yet know beyond
this. For tho' the Moon has been divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into Sea and Land, and the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
so much acknowledged, that a Man's
parts must have been suspected, that
would have doubted of the thing; and
tho' the obscure parts of its Body, have
been generally thought to be Watery, and
the Luminous parts, Earthy and Solid,
yet this Division seems rather to be
grounded upon an inference of Reason,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:64296:57"/>
to wit, that the obscure and Watery
parts imbibe the Light, whereas the
Earthy Solid parts reflect it, than upon
the experience of Sense, assisted by Glasses.
These Glasses indeed discover the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt the dark and Luminous
parts much more clearly, than the naked
eye can, but will never show the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of either, or what Substance they
are of, much less distinguish the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
portions of Earth and Water: But
Men come possess'd with an opinion of
Seas and Rivers, and then easily think
they see them (as every sound does an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
the tune that runs in our ears) and
after one Man has seen them, it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to the next, not to be as acute and
distinguishing as he, and so we cheat one
another into a tolerable agreement. That
this is the Case I am verily perswaded, for
tho' I can neither pretend to good eyes,
nor good Glasses, and therefore will lay
no weight upon my own opinion, yet <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius</hi>
who had them in perfection, and
who writ since these accurate Maps were
taken, could neither observe Seas nor Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
in the Moon, and expresly denys, that
any such are to be seen there<note n="q" place="margin">Cosmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theor. p. 114.</note> And there
is this reason besides, that if any such were,
they must necessarily raise a mighty <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosphere,</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:64296:58"/>
which, as it would hinder our
clear prospect at all times, so by its clouds,
it would sometimes darken one part of the
Moons Body, and sometimes another;
whereas now the dark and Luminous parts
are always the same: So that as far as I can
see, we know little more of the Moon,
than that it is an Opake and solid Body,
and so much we were pretty well assur'd
of, before <hi>Telescopes</hi> came in fashion.</p>
               <p>No doubt, Telescopes are a noble In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
and the discoveries that have
been made by them are very considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but as to the discovering thereby
the Nature and Substance of Heavenly
Bodies, I look upon it as utterly impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible:
And yet this is the modish way
of framing new Worlds; we first ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
Seas and Rivers, in the Moon, and
if such be there, there must be Plants
that they water, and if Plants, there must
be likewise Animals to feed upon them,
and all these are design'd for the service
of Men. The reason is easily carry'd fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for if the Moon be a World, by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Reason, so must the other Planets
be also, and if all the visible Planets are
carried about in the Vortex of the Sun,
which is no better than the other Stars,
no doubt, the other fix'd Stars, have
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:64296:58"/>
their attending Planets, as well as the
Sun, and so we have a Plurality of
Worlds with a witness: but this chain of
reasoning is easily broken, by breaking
its first Link, for if there be no Waters
in the Moon, in consequence of that, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are there any Plants, or Animals,
or Men, and if none of these be there,
by parity of reason, neither are there
any in the other Planets, and so the whole
Chain falls to pieces.</p>
               <p>These World-mongers are always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
the improbability of God's fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so many vast and glorious Bodies, only
for the sake of this Earth, so inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a portion of the whole: Amongst
the rest <hi>Hugeni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

makes this Objection, in another part
of his Book,<note n="r" place="margin">P. 33.</note> as if he had forgot him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
thinks it enough to say, That God
rais'd this mighty Frame of things, that
he might contemplate and delight him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
thereby; and were there no other
reason, we ought to acquiesce in this:
But they that argue thus, seem to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
things by their Bulk, which is a
false way of reasoning; there is more
Beauty and Contrivance in the Structure
of a humane Body, than there is in the
Glorious Body of the Sun, and more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:64296:59"/>
in one rational immaterial Soul,
than in the whole Mass of Matter, be
it never so bulky. There cannot then
be any absurdity in saying, that all things
were created for the sake of this inferior
World, and the Inhabitants thereof, and
they that have such mean thoughts of it,
seem not to have consider'd, who it
was that died to redeem it. Let them

we be bewildred in our search after
Spiritual abstracted Truths, in the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of Universals, and of things of
a Transcendental Nature, such as fall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
under the consideration of Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sics?
For tho Metaphsiycal Truths may
be certain enough in their own nature,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:64296:60"/>
yet they are not usually so to us, but being
abstruse things, and lying deep and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from Sense, it is not every one that
is capable of understanding them, and
there are yet fewer that understand their
true use. They are usually under the
Conduct of subtle Men, and these nice Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors,
instead of resolving doubts, have
spun out new difficulties, and fram'd Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths,
out of which they have scarce been
able to disentangle themselves: So that
Metaphysics, which were at first only Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Theology, are now become the most
artificial thing in the World.</p>
               <p>One need only dip into any System, to
see how these Men are plung'd in setting
out, for whereas there are two things of
principal consideration in Metaphysical
Knowledge, its <hi>Object</hi> and <hi>Affections;</hi> and
whereas Philosophers are pretty well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
about the Object of other Sciences,
as that Quantity is the Object of Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics;
and matter of Physics, and so of
the rest; the Metaphysicians have not
come to any tolerable agreement about the
Object of this Science, or <hi>Sapience,</hi> or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you will call it: <hi>Suarez</hi> produceth six
different opinions, and himself brings the
seventh, which is his own. And as to its
Affections, they are again at a plunge
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64296:60"/>
to find out Affections different from <hi>Being</hi>
(which seems to comprehend every thing)
for if the <hi>Affections</hi> and <hi>Subject</hi> are the
same, their Demonstrations are Indenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
and prove nothing. But these are
dry Considerations.</p>
               <p>What <hi>Aristotle</hi> has done upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
is much short of a perfect Work, and
is rather an Essay, than a Compleat Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
for tho' he has left fourteen Books up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Subject, yet they are loose and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digested,
(which was not usual with <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi>
where he has given his last hand)
and the two last are so Foreign to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
and so unsuitable to the place they
stand in, that some have thought fit either
to strike them out of his Works, or to place
them in a new order: And indeed his
twelfth Book should seem to be his last,
which concludes with his Notion of God
and Spiritual Beings; though none of his
Books are Divine enough, to give a true
account of Natural Theology. It is plain
he wants light in these matters, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knows where to fix, nor what to
determine; which is one reason of the
obscurity of his Books of Metaphysics, for
no Man can write clearer than he thinks.
And therefore his Commentators have
often tug'd in vain, in labouring to make
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64296:61"/>
out a meaning, where possibly the Author
himself was at a loss. If any Man could
have understood him, <hi>Avicen</hi> had the best
plea, who was as subtle a Philosopher and
study'd him as much as perhaps any
Man ever did; and yet after he had
read his Metaphysics forty times over,
and had them all by heart (which I will
venture to say, is more than ever any
Man will do again) he was forc'd to
lay them aside as unintelligible<note n="s" place="margin">V. vit. Avicen. p. 3.</note> In
one thing I must do him right, that
whereas he has been represented as too
Positive and Dogmatical in his opinions,
it is the fault of his Followers, not his:
He begins these Books in a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
manner: His third Book (for the
two first are chiefly Prefatory) is taken
up with doubts, and the Title of the
first Chapter is, <hi>The use of Doubting,</hi> to
do which well, he makes one mark of
a Philosopher; and gives this reason,
because unless a Man knows how to
find out and state a difficulty, it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to solve it, as a Man must see the folds
and windings of a knot, before he can
unty it. So that the Art of doubting is
no new invention, having been known
to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> as well as the Moderns, with
this difference only, that he does it more
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64296:61"/>
modestly, and is not so Sceptical, as the first
mighty pretender to this way.</p>
               <p>And because we are come thus far, let
us consider this new Method of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
by doubting, upon which our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Metaphysicksturn so much, and of
which our new Philosophers talk so loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
For my part I can see no great use
either of their doubting, or of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
it leads to. For what is it we
must doubt of? Even of the most
certains Truths in Nature, of the verity
of our own Bodies, as whether we have
Hands, Arms, and Legs<note n="t" place="margin">Cart. Princip. p. 2. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditat. 1.</note> And
what is the first knowledge that results
from this doubting? That since I doubt,
I am; for that which doubts must it
self necessarily have a Being. Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
all this, I do not think we are
much the wiser; for had ever any Man
real doubts of these matters? Or did
ever any Man in his Wits question the
truth of his own Being? Such doubts
and such proofs are only fitted for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
Persons, and I hope we are not
Philosophizing at this time of day to yield
conviction to such Men. Evident truths
and first Principles may be reasonably sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
and indeed they must be suppos'd,
for they are not capable of proof, there
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:64296:62"/>
being nothing clearer by which they may
be prov'd; and for Men to offer at proof
in such matters may make a pompous
show, but is no real advancement of
knowledge. The old way of proceeding
upon allow'd Principles seems to me more
rational than this method of questioning
every thing, till we have unsetled the first
grounds and foundations of Truth; and
however useful doubting may be in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical
Enquiries, it ought always to
suppose a ground, for a groundless doubt
is so far irrational.</p>
               <p>After our Philosopher has done with
doubting, and has prov'd to us our own
Existence, he brings us at last to the
Being of a God,<note n="u" place="margin">Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat. 3.</note> in which a great part
of his Metaphysics is spent; and I am so
unwilling to weaken any proof to that
purpose, that I shall pass it over: On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thus much may be inoffensively said,
that his proof from the <hi>Idea,</hi> is the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strusest
and the least conclusive argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that has been brought, for tho'
constant and universal agreement in the
Notion of a God, may be a good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to prove his Existence, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
enough to the weakest Capacities,
yet this <hi>Idea</hi> as managed by our Author,
is neither clear nor very conclusive: For
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64296:62"/>
what is there of either, in the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Perfection or Reality of this <hi>Idea,</hi>
being greater than the formal Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Reality in the Mind, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that this <hi>Idea</hi> cannot proceed from
thence, but must have some Superior
Cause to produce it? When after all
this Objective Reality is nothing more
than an operation of the Mind, or rather
a mode of its operation, which is such a
Reality, as one would imagine, the Mind
alone might be able to give it.</p>
               <p>But this Philosophers Metaphysics are
only Meditations, a Compleat Treatise
was to be given us by his Followers;
amongst whom <hi>M. Poiret,</hi> I know not
how, has obtain'd a name; he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
upon his Master, and is so full of
thinking, that he has made Cogitation
to be the substance of the Mind<note n="x" place="margin">Cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat. Ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. l. 2. c. 3. 5.</note>,
and in pursuance of this, the Essence of
God to be likewise Cogitation; which,
with other odd opinions will hardly
recommend him to considering Men. I
always lookt upon <hi>M. Poiret</hi> as a <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natic</hi>
in Philosophy, and have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
in my Opinion, by what has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
since; for as Phanaticism has no
bounds, he has since (if he be the same
Man) expres,'d it in his Divinity, by
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64296:63"/>
licking up the vomit, and adoring the
Opinions of a silly Woman, of <hi>whose In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration
he is as well assur'd as of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a God</hi>
                  <note n="y" place="margin">V. Bour. Det. Nar. 1. p. 10.</note>; an expression which
nothing but Enthusiasm, can excuse from
Blasphemy. And therefore I have the
more wondred to see a comparison form'd
betwixt <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>M. Poiret,</hi> which I could
have wish'd had been let alone.</p>
               <p>I must rank <hi>Mallebranch</hi> in the same
order, whose <hi>Recherche</hi> has furnish'd out
such refin'd and abstracted Metaphysics,
as if they were designed for Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors;
he has exalted <hi>Ideas</hi> to their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Height, and because they bore not
with them certainty enough, whilst
they were barely operations of the mind,
or representations from external Objects,
he has plac'd them in a Subject that
cannot err, to wit, in the Wisdom of
God himself, whom having suppos'd
to be the Place of Spirits, as Space is of
Bodies, and that there is an intimate
Union betwixt God and the Soul of Man,
by attending to him, who is always
presential to our Minds, we are to see
all things in this <hi>Ideal,</hi> or Intelligible
world<note n="z" place="margin">Rech. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. 3. Par. 2. c. 6.</note>. Now tho' there can be no
doubt, but God can lead us into all
Truth, by displaying himself to us,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64296:63"/>
and perhaps may deal thus with us when
we are in Heaven, yet this way seems
too Supernatural whilst on Earth, and too
clear for frail and weak Men, who are not
yet to know by Vision; and it is withal
so like the inward Light of a New Sect of
Men, as not to make it over reputable: To
which purpose it is very remarkable, that
<hi>Mallebranch</hi>'s Opinion having been espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of late, by an Ingenious Person of our
own, with all the advantages of Beauty of
Style and Perspicuity of Expression, yet
the Men of New Light have taken such
hold of it, as to make it necessary for him
to write an Apology to disingage himself
from the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who would needs have
it thought they had gain'd a Proselyte
<note n="a" place="margin">V. Cond. Hum. Lif. p. 183.</note>: Wherein tho' he has distiguish'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from these People, yet thus much he
owns, <hi>That if the Quakers understood their own
N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tion, and knew how to explain it, and into
what Principles to resolve it, it would not very
much differ from his.</hi> In another thing there
is too great an agreement: that these men
of thought have too low a value for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Learning, either as it lies in our
common Books, or in the Book of Nature,
in respect of that light which displays it
self from the <hi>Ideal</hi> World, by attending to
which, with pure and defaecate Minds,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64296:64"/>
they suppose Knowledge to be most easily
had. Experience and Deductions have
been formerly esteemed useful, but
in this compendious way to knowledge,
provided we make our approaches, with
our Souls purg'd and with due preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Mind, there needs little more than
application and attention. Indeed Prayer
has been made another Condition, which
tho' it be proper and of good use upon all
occasions, yet is not so pertinent here,
where we speak only of natural means.</p>

               <p>I Scarce ever met with any Historian,
who does not write true History, if
you will take an account of him from his
Preface, and not be too nice in examining
his Book; the first Pages are usually fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the Care and Integrity of
the Author, which possibly, are to be
found no where else: Those who have
taken most care, have been charg'd with
some negligence, and all of them have
been so far faulty, as to extort a Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from one of their number, wherein he
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64296:64"/>
fairly owns, That there is none of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians,
that do not lie in some things<note n="b" place="margin">Vopisc. juxta init.—Neminem Scriptorum quantum ad Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, non aliquid esse mentitum.</note>.
He names some of the most unexceptiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and pretends to be able to make good
his charge by uncontestable proofs. Let
us take a short view.</p>
               <p>We have little considerable remaining
of Profane Ancient Story, except what we
have left us, by the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans;</hi>
for as to the <hi>Chaldaean</hi> History of <hi>Berosus;</hi>
and the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> of <hi>Manetho</hi> they both
writ since <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and we have only
some Fragments of them left preserved by
<hi>Iosephus, Eusebius,</hi> &amp;c. and the Books that
go under these great names, are the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Forgeries of <hi>Annius</hi> of <hi>Viterbo.</hi> And
as to <hi>Sanchoniathon,</hi> who has given us the
<hi>Phoenician</hi> History, tho' he pretends to be
much more <hi>Ancient,</hi> yet his great <hi>Antiquity</hi>
has been question'd by <hi>Scaliger,</hi> and his very
Being, by Mr. <hi>Dodwell,</hi> So that those we are
to depend on are the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Greeks as they have not been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for their veracity in any respect, so
their Truth and Integrity in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
has been always so questionable, That
<hi>Graecia Mendax</hi> has been stigmatiz'd in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story:
We have no tolerable account from
them before the Olympiads, the times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
these were the Mythic Ages, and are
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:64296:65"/>
all Fable; and when the Historical Age
commenceth, our Accounts of things are
not much better: For they having not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally
had any Public Annals, or Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of things, and amongst their Ancient
Authors, the <hi>Poets</hi> having had the first
rank; we may easily imagine what sort of
Accounts are to be expected from those
Men, who were either to follow uncertain
Reports and Traditions, or what is much
worse, to Copy the Poets. Accordingly
their first Accounts were very loose,
and rather Poems than Histories, which
they have been charg'd with by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
pretty freely, and <hi>Quinctilian</hi> is so far
from softning the matter; That he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
the liberty they took to a Poetic Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
<note n="c" place="margin">Instit. l. 2. c. 4.</note>. But no Man has expos'd
them so much as <hi>Iosephus</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Contr. Appion. l. 1.</note> has done.
He tells them, <hi>Their accounts of things are
all novel, that they have no Public and Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic
Annals, nor any Author more Ancient than</hi>
Homer, <hi>and those they have do differ from one
another, that</hi> Hellanicus, <hi>differs from</hi> Acusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,
<hi>that</hi> Acusilaus <hi>corrects</hi> Hesiod; <hi>and</hi>
Hellanicus, Ephorus; <hi>he again is corrected
by</hi> Timaeus, <hi>as</hi> Timaeus <hi>is by others; and</hi>
Herodotus, <hi>by all:</hi> And yet this is that
<hi>Herodotus,</hi> who has been styl'd the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of History, tho' he might with equal
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64296:65"/>
right be nam'd the Parent of Fable. I
know what Apologies have been made
for him, especially from late Voyages
and Discoveries; But it is enough to say,
he cannot be defended, and that those
few Instances, which have been brought,
do rather show the Wit of his Apologists,
than signifie much towards the redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Credit of their Author; his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
are too numerous and too gross to be
accounted for, from some accidental agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with Modern Discoveries.</p>
               <p>It must be confest, some of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Historians, have writ more cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously,
and in this, the Children have
exceeded their Father, particularly <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides</hi>
who has been noted for his Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
and Care; but not to insist upon
<hi>Iosephus</hi>'s Authority, who has not exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him from the Common Censure, a
great part of his History is taken up
with large Speeches and Harangues,
which had never any Existence, except
in the imagination of his own Brain;
and the rest of his Story is of too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
extent, both as to time and place,
to be of any considerable importance in
the account of ancient times, of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
whereof he himself complains in the
entrance of his Book. He who has done
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64296:66"/>
most and whose accounts are most exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
is <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> taking his rise from
the Original of things and describing the
World in its full Latitude and extent; and
let any one excuse him from Fable, and
the Cause is yielded. His first five Books
are almost a continued Fable, describing
more Ages than the World has had dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and such Nations as have had no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<hi>Lucian</hi>'s true History has scarce any
thing more incredible, than what may be
met with in that Author. The best thing
that can be urg'd in his excuse is, that he
owns and confesseth the Charge, that is
brought against him, Entituling his first
Books, <hi>Mythic History,</hi> which in plain Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
is Fabulous. But this argument has
been largely prosecuted by a learned
Pen<note n="e" place="margin">Orig. Sacr. cap. 4.</note>.</p>
               <p>Well but however fabulous the Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
may have been, there may be more
certainty in Roman Story: It is possible
there may, and yet not near so much, as
might be desir'd. The most compleat
and only General History we have among
them, is <hi>Livy,</hi> whose Genius has been
thought to equal the Majesty of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
he describes: To pass by his <hi>Patavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
which has been understood by some,
of Partiality to his Country, and his long
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:64296:66"/>
Orations that are pure Fiction; and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
Prodigies, which are such vanities
as only serve to amuse the weaker sort of
People; his accounts of remote times are
dim and blind, and for want of suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
vouchers, are justly questionable. He
himself describes the first times, to the
Foundation of <hi>Rome,</hi> as a Poetical Period,
rather than grounded upon undoubted
Monuments<note n="f" place="margin">Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the City, he complains, that the use
of Letters had been very rare, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
little could be consign'd to writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that therefore the memory of things
was his best Guide, at least so far, as to
the burning of <hi>Rome,</hi> when most of their
publick Monuments, did perish with
their City<note n="g" place="margin">Lib. 6. p. 1.</note>: which could they have
been preserv'd, yet they were so <hi>jejune</hi>
and naked, that they could hardly furnish
out materials for a tolerable History.</p>
               <p>The first ground of the Roman Story
is the coming of <hi>Aeneas</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> with this
<hi>Livy</hi> begins his Book, and ushers it in
with tolerable assurance, and if any thing
could be known among them, it must
have been their own original, and yet
this is so far from being allow'd, that <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo</hi>
                  <note n="h" place="margin">Lib. 13.</note> plainly shows, <hi>Aeneas</hi> never stir'd
out of <hi>Troy;</hi> and if <hi>Homer</hi>'s Authority be
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:64296:67"/>
of any weight, it is plain, he did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
die there, but his Posterity were to
reign there in succeeding Ages<note n="i" place="margin">Iliad. 20. l. 306.</note>. And
that he never set foot in <hi>Italy,</hi> has been
made pretty evident, in a late Dissertati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to that purpose<note n="k" place="margin">Bochart. Epist. num, Aeneas unquam fuerit in Italiâ.</note>. And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
what can be said against it,
this was so receiv'd a Truth at <hi>Rome,</hi> that
the ancient Families deriv'd from <hi>Venus</hi>
and <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and upon this reason, the
People of <hi>Troy</hi> had Privileges and Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
granted them by the Romans, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
by <hi>I. Caesar</hi> who deriv'd from
them. But this was an effect of partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to their Country and of vanity, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thought descended from Gods and
Heroes, wherein with like reason, they
have been since imitated by other Nations.</p>
               <p>The truth of it is, this partiality to
their Nation does show it self in all their
Historians; they represent themselves not
only as the most Valiant People, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
as the most Just and Faithful in all
their Wars and Alliances, and having
had the advantage of writing their own
Story, they must have been believ'd in
all they say, had not there been some way
left of discovering the contrary. Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
discover the opinion their Enemies
had of them; <hi>Galgacus</hi> our brave Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:64296:67"/>
is introduc'd describing them as
Pyrats and public Robbers, Men of insa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable
Avarice and unbounded Ambition,
and upon these motives, as disturbers of
the Peace of Manking: And tho no doubt
that noble Speech of his in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> were
made for him, yet the Historian had not
observ'd a due Decorum, had he not
made him speak the Sense, their Enemies
had of the Roman People. And tho <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybius</hi>
does sometimes censure the Roman
Justice, yet he no where discovers so much
truth, as by what he tells us, of <hi>Fabius</hi>
and <hi>Philinus:</hi> It seems these two had writ
the <hi>Panic</hi> War, the one a <hi>Roman,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a <hi>Carthaginian;</hi> the one blames the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> almost in every thing, and
the other the <hi>Romans:</hi> It is possible
they might both be blameable, but I
know no reason, why we are not to give
as much credit to the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> as we
are to the <hi>Roman.</hi> Had such Historians as
<hi>Philinus</hi> been yet preserv'd, we might then
have known all the <hi>Romans</hi> faults, as we
now read little, besides their Vertues; tho'
we have the less need of them to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
the Christian Apologists<note n="l" place="margin">V. Min. Felix. v. Lanct. Inst.</note> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
left such an account of their Justice
and public Vertues, as is very inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
with their own Histories. And
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64296:68"/>
indeed we have one sure way of detecting
their insincerity, by comparing them with
sacred Story: what monstrous absurdities
have <hi>Iustin</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> related of the <hi>Iews,</hi>
where they might have had opportunities
of being better inform'd? and we are not
to think, that they have been more inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
in knowing, or perhaps much more
favourable in describing other Nations:
So that upon the whole, the <hi>Romans</hi> in
this matter have not much out-done their
Neighbours.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant what mighty expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations
were conceiv'd of one Man<note n="m" place="margin">Cic. de leg. l. 1. p. 1.</note>,
I mean <hi>Cicero,</hi> and how forward Men
have been in imagining, that nothing
could have been wanting in this kind,
had he undertaken the work, he once
intended. For my part I scarce wish
he had, and cannot but think, he would
have been as partial, and under as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
prejudices, as any of the rest. For
how do you think he had cut out and
contriv'd his Work? He had designed
a History from the foundation of <hi>Rome,</hi>
to his time, and in order to that designed
to begin at his own <hi>Consulate,</hi> and write

no doubt, was in his head, and
after he had press'd his Friends to write
that War, and could not prevail with
them to undertake it, he is resolv'd to do
it himself; and whether in the conduct
of the Work, <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Character would not
have been too large, and <hi>Catiline</hi>'s too foul,
I leave to every Man to judge: Would
not <hi>Catiline</hi> have been painted out in the

Orations? And had our Orator's History
come down as low as <hi>Anthony,</hi> should we
not have had too much of the <hi>Philippies,</hi> to
be reconcilable to truth? <hi>Cicero</hi> requires
so much of Oratory as an ingredient in an

               <p>If I should descend to Modern times,
I should have a large field before me,
but the path is so trodden, that every
Man's own reading will furnish him
with observations: If there should be
any Man, who has made none of this
kind, he needs only peruse the <hi>English</hi>
and <hi>French</hi> Historians, and by compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them together, he will find matter
of Diversion and Admiration at the same
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64296:69"/>
time. How differently do they describe
the same action? How manifestly in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of a Party? How often do the <hi>French</hi>
glory in a Victory, which with the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
is esteem'd an Overthrow? And again
how do the <hi>English</hi> sometimes proclaim
Victory, where their Enemies think they
have given them a Defeat? How do they
both Triumph, where perhaps neither of
them have reason to glory? Or if the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
be too undeniably on our side to
be contested, as at <hi>Agincourt</hi> and <hi>Cressey,</hi>
how do our Enemies seek to lessen it? How
do they palliate every thing, and charge
Heaven, or cross accidents, or mad De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair,
with the fortune of the Day? How
do they turn every Stone and labour to
have the success and Honour fall any
where, rather than on the English?
Whereas on the other side, How do the
English arrogate all to themselves, and
their own courage, and scarce allow any
share to Fortune or Despair, or lucky ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents.
You have <hi>Fabius</hi> and <hi>Philinus,</hi>
only altering the Nation in the <hi>French</hi> and
<hi>English.</hi> What a reproach to truth was it,
That a <hi>Duke of Orleans,</hi> one of the first Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in <hi>France,</hi> should be said to be openly
executed for Treason at <hi>Paris;</hi> as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
in twenty Histories, whilst the D.

amongst the <hi>English,</hi> that upon an invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to a Friends House, the Person invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
should in compliment, lie with his
Neighbour's Wife? And yet this, however
barbarous it may seem, has been related,
by an European Historian<note n="q" place="margin">Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocond. l. 2. p. 49.</note>, a Christian,
and one that liv'd almost to the last Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury.
Would not a Man have suspected,
he had liv'd two thousand years ago, or in
some remote corner of the world, where
the <hi>English</hi> had been reckon'd amongst
Barbarous People?</p>
               <p>These are Domestick Instances. If we
look abroad; upon the discovery of the
<hi>West-Indies,</hi> what strange Relations have
we had from thence? we have been told
there of a Nation of <hi>Amazons,</hi> of Giants
of a prodigious Stature, the People of
such monstrous Shape and truculent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
as if they were of another Species;
and as many <hi>Cannibals,</hi> as might eat up

further enquiry, we meet with no
<hi>Amazons,</hi> unless long Hair and want of

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64296:70"/>
and the People are much of the same

But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> either saw them
in a fright, or were under the vanity of
reporting strange things, or being in
love with the Gold of the Country; they
were to represent the People as Monsters,
that they might have a fairer pretence
to destroy them. And such Instances
may serve to illustrate ancient History.
Doubtless, <hi>Herodot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s</hi> and <hi>Diodorus</hi> were
impos'd upon by such false Relations, and
had not the like opportunities with us,
of correcting their mistakes.</p>
               <p>I should be infinitely tedious, should
I give a History of Incredible things,
and therefore I only touch upon some
few, and those too matters of Fact, which
ought to be most certain: Whereas should
we launch out into Mysteries of State and
the Cabinets of Princes, which are the
most instructive part, and most properly
the Business of an Historian, we should
be still more in the dark. Matters of
Fact are visible things, and fall under
common observation, whereas politic rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and considerations, are abstruse
and hidden, and only penetrated into,
by some few of clearer Capacity and
deeper Reach: every ordinary Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:64296:70"/>
can judge of time by the point or
hand, but the spring and secret Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are only observ'd by Men of skill.
These Men in the State are the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
tho' the secret be often hid even
from them; for the Reasons which Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
give, are often only pretended, and
rather what they would have others think
of them than the true motives by which
they are guided. Such things are out of
my Road, and therefore I dismiss them.</p>
               <p>I shall only observe further, that
however vicious our Histories may be
already, there has been one way taken to
make them more corrupt, by <hi>Secret Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
and <hi>Turkish Spies,</hi> and other Books
of the like nature, which by an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Truth and by mingling it
with falshood, impose upon Men of
easie belief, and are now grown so nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous,
that it is a matter of Discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to distinguish betwixt Spurious and
Genuine Pieces. To which I may add
<hi>Varillas</hi> and <hi>Maimburgh,</hi> and other <hi>French</hi>
Authors, who write with so Romantic
an Air, as if they design'd rather plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
Books, than true History, and rather
to entertain, than inform their Reader;
who give us paint instead of Dress, and
make Heroes, if they cannot find them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:64296:71"/>I have done with this Head, and
have kept close to one Condition of
History, the consideration of its Truth;
for should I take in all the Conditions
requir'd by <hi>Vossius</hi> and <hi>Le Moyne,</hi> we
should either have very little History<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or none at all. The Jesuit <hi>Le Moyne,</hi>
one of the last that has treated of this
Subject, requires such Conditions, and
lays down such Rules as no Man can
follow, and is so nice in his Examples, as
to allow<note n="s" place="margin">Disc. 1. ch. 2.</note> only four Historians among
the <hi>Romans</hi> and not so many among the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> and all of them short of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And as to the Moderns, he is yet
more scrupulous, in admitting them into
account, only it had been strange, had he
not found two or three of his own Order,
<hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

thinks fit to equal with <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Livy.</hi>
He designs us a History himself, and to
that end has chalk'd out such a method
as he means to pursue; but if we may
Judge of his veracity, by his perpetually
running a Parallel betwixt History and
Poem; or of his prejudices, by his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
to his Order, he is not like to out-do
his Predecessors: And notwithstanding
his great design, we may conclude this
Chapter, as he does his Book, That <hi>a
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:64296:71"/>
Compleat History, shall not appear, but in that

It is time and place that give Life as well
as Beauty, and a naked relation of things,
without Circumstance, is very unaffecting
stuff: So that as if these can be had, they
will be an accession of Beauty, in want of
these, there will be as great a blemish.
And in what measure we have them, we
must next enquire.</p>
               <p>And here again I shall pass by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous
accounts of times, such as the
<hi>Chinese, Aegyptian</hi> and <hi>Chaldaean</hi> may be

Learned Countryman Sir <hi>Iohn Marsham;</hi>
yet there are so many things to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
in their Accounts, and so little
possibility of proof at so immense a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
that the Systems which they
raise are perfectly precarious; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the aim of those Authors was, I
doubt neither of their Books have done
Service to Religion. They seem to me
like an Hypothesis in Philosophy, which
being granted, our Philosophers will ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
plausibly upon it, and make a shift
to reconcile all difficulties that shall
be brought, though the ground they go
upon be Fiction and Enchanted: so
these men will shift off objections pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
plausibly, and lay things together in
Specious order, tho' the Foundation they
build upon, be laid in the Air.</p>
               <p>'Tis true our Accounts of <hi>Greece</hi> are
somewhat more clear and certain, but
then they are such as are too recent; if
you trace them up to their remote Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,
the <hi>Graecians</hi> are as obscure as the
rest of the World; The <hi>Athenians,</hi> the most

and either sprung from the Earth or
had no original at all. When their Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:64296:72"/>
Age takes place, yet their Periods
of time are dark and confus'd, and their
Chronology is not so ancient as their Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story.
This has been observ'd by Sir <hi>I.
Marsham</hi>
                  <note n="t" place="margin">Chron. Can. p. 14, 139.</note>, who shows that the Ancient
<hi>Greeks,</hi> were wholly unskilfull in Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,
especially in the <hi>Technical</hi> part of it.
There was such diversity and inequality
in their Years, and such variety in their
Periods and Cycles, as did necessarily oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
great Confusion; and it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
they should make right Computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of times, where they had no sure rule
to go by: This they had not, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
their year was so disordered, and
their Recurrent Feasts thereby so unsetled,
That <hi>Aristophanes</hi>
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Ap. Seld Marm. Arund. p. 233.</note> pleasantly tells us,
that the Gods themselves did not know
them, and introduceth the God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
of the Moon, that by her uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
notice of these good times, they were
disappointed of their Entertainments, and
often forc'd to return back hungry to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
<hi>Meton</hi> was the first who adjusted
these differences, and reduc'd their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
to tolerable Regularity, by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of that famous Period of nineteen
Years, for which he has deserved the
honour to be recorded in Letters of Gold;
Tho' his Period was not so accurate, as not
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64296:73"/>
to be capable of amendment, and therefor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was afterwards corrected by <hi>Calippus</hi> and
<hi>Hipparchus.</hi> So very unsteddy have their
computations been. The <hi>Arcadians</hi> may
have been thought to have been before
them in this, if you will take that account
of their being before the Moon, assign'd
by some; by understanding it of their
having had a Course of Lunar Years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Greeks</hi> had fix'd their Periods;
unless <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s reason will be thought
more probable<note n="x" place="margin">Proleg. ad Emend. p. 3.</note>.</p>
               <p>Nor are the <hi>Roman</hi> Computations
more Regular: It has been look'd upon
as matter of wonder, That the <hi>Romans</hi>
should differ so much in their first and
great <hi>Epocha,</hi> the time of building their
City; <hi>Onuphrius</hi>
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. ad Fast. p. 15.</note> reckons up seven
different opinions, most of them main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by considerable Authorities, and
is not a little amazed at the disagreement.
I should have wondred if it had been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
considering either the darkness of
their Ancient History, or the irregularity
and unequalness of their Computations.
So little regard had they to order in time,
upon the Foundation of their City, that
their first Years were neither regulated by
the Course of Sun or Moon. <hi>Romulus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
such a Year as might be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:64296:73"/>
from a Warlike Prince, and an Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate
People, consisting of ten Months,

                  <note n="z" place="margin">V. Blon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del Hist. du Cal. Rom. L. 3. C. 1.</note>: and although this Year was
soon discover'd to fall short of the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Year and Course of the Sun; yet it
is probable, he had not Skill, or perhaps
Concern enough to correct the Mistake;
and the Intercalations that were made,
were done in an unskilful, or negligent
Manner: So that the <hi>Year of Confusion</hi>
must have happen'd sooner than it did,
had he not been succeeded by a Prince,
who had more inclination for the Arts of
Peace than War. <hi>Numa</hi> undertook the
Calendar, where <hi>Romulus</hi> had left it,
and tho' I do not think he had any assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> as some have i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<note n="a" place="margin">Blond. ib. cap. 2.</note>, (which I doubt will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be a Chronological Mistake) yet
he reduced the Year to better order, than
could be reasonably hop'd for, in so dim
an Age, by adding the two Months,
which had been wanting in <hi>Romulus</hi>'s
Account, and ordering such Intercalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to be made, as were necessary to set
right the irregular Days. But whether
it was that his Calendar was yet very
imperfect, or that the High-Priests (with
whom the power of Intercalation was
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:64296:74"/>
lodg'd) were wanting in their Duty, or
whether somewhat of both concurr'd to
the miscarriage; this is certain, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>I. Caesar</hi>'s time, the course of the
Year was so much disorder'd, that the
Months had run back into one another,
their Winter was run into Autumn, and
their Summer into Spring; and had not

their Winter might have run into Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
These Inconveniences being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd

it; by one Year of <hi>Confusion,</hi> he brought
their Calendar again to order, by such a
Regulation, as is too well known, to need
to be explain'd. However, his Computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
(notwithstanding the Skill of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker)
were not accurate enough, for in
less than 1300 Years from the Council of
<hi>Nice,</hi> to <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII.) the Calendar and
the Heavens were found to be again at
Discord, and to vary ten Days in the
Course of the Sun, and about four Days
in the Course of the Moon, which brought
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:64296:74"/>
things into such disorder, as to occasion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Year of <hi>Confusion,</hi> under that Pope,
in the Year 1582.</p>
               <p>And tho' this Pope's Reformation, has
been thought so compleat, as to be styl'd
<hi>A Perpetual Calendar,</hi> and Medals have
been struck upon the occasion to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate
the Memory of the thing, yet he
must be a bold Man that will undertake,
it shall be perpetual, or will venture to
maintain it to be so exact, as not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of improvement. This is well known,
that it had not been long abroad, till
it was censur'd, and its failings discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Calvisius,</hi> and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

And unless the Motions of the Sun

to Minutes and Scruples, (which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

under an Invariable Rule. However this
be, unless this Calendar were more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally

to occasion further confusion: For whilst it

and the <hi>Iulian</hi> Account obtains, in almost
all the other <hi>Christian</hi> parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> we
are cutting out Work for future Critics,
who are like to find Employment e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
some Hundred Years hence, in
reconciling the Differences which shall
arise from the Old and New Style.</p>
               <p>From this Historical Account of <hi>Times,</hi>
I think we have a fair Specimen of the
uncertainty of Chronology. Should we
remove the Scene from Times to Men,
they will further evince this Truth: The
two great Men in this sort of Learning,
were <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Petavius,</hi> the former
of these has taken prodigious pains upon
the Subject; which appears in several of
his Works, so more particularly, in his
great Work of the <hi>Emendation of Times,</hi>
of which he had so good an Opinion,
and was so much Complemented by
Learned Men, upon his Divine and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Work, that a Man would have
imagin'd the Difficulties in the Accounts
of Time, had been pretty well clear'd,
and little left to be done further. His
<hi>Divine Work</hi> had not been long abroad
in the World, e're it was taken notice of
by <hi>Petavius,</hi> who had spent as much
time in these Studies, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> had, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:64296:75"/>
is so far from allowing him those migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Praises, that he shows, he had been
almost under a continued mistake. A
great part of <hi>Petavius</hi>'s <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Times;</hi>
is spent in confuting <hi>Scaliger,</hi> scarce a
Chapter in his five first large Books,
wherein <hi>Scaliger</hi> is not mentioned, and
his many Errors and Hallucinations dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd;
in such manner, that his Work
might as reasonably be entitled a Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of <hi>Scaliger,</hi> as a <hi>Doctrine of Times.</hi>
He will scarce allow him to have done
any thing well in Chronology, or to
have made any considerable Discovery,
unless it were in the <hi>Iulian Period,</hi> and
after he had granted him that Praise, as
if he had done him too much Honor, he
retracts that Commendation, and will
not allow him to be the Inventor of that
Period, but to have stole it from the
<hi>Greeks</hi>

this, remain in the same obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,

order, under this common Period, than
they were in before. So that either <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi>
had discover'd nothing, at least no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
considerable, or he has been very

In many things, no doubt, they

both of them pretend to demonstrate,
and in many of their Calculations pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
with Mathematical assurance.</p>
               <p>What has been done since, has been
chiefly in the Historical part of Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,
(the Controversie some Years ago,
having run much in the Technical, the
Reformation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Calendar, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

(to say nothing of his other Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries)
concerning the <hi>Quinquennalia,

given much Light to the <hi>Roman Fasti,</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:64296:76"/>
and discover'd the Mistakes of <hi>Scaliger,
Petavius, Baronius,</hi> and most of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians
and Chronologers, who have
Writ before his Time. How far his
Observation will hold, Time must show;
he seems to glory too much, where he

had represented as too modern Authority
to be much credited, living in the <hi>Tenth

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64296:77"/>
his own Church, a trifling <hi>Arabic</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian,
without Judgment, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
himself: And yet this same <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychius,</hi>
when he favours the Bishop's
Opinion, tho' he knew little of his own
Church, is good Authority in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> where he
had reason to be ignorant,<note n="f" place="margin">Oper. Posthum. Dis. 1. C. 14.</note> and the
Bishop is so possess'd with him, that he
forsakes our <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Authors, to
follow his Footsteps; altho' his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
be really of no value, and he has
had that right done him to be contemned
by most of those who have taken notice
of him; except Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> who to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
his Anger against the Bishop, gave
us a part of this Author, and encouraged
Dr. <hi>Pocock</hi> to publish the rest.</p>
               <p>We have been promis'd great things
of late from Medals and Inscriptions;
<hi>Ez. Spanheym</hi> famous for his Book, <hi>De
usu Numismatum,</hi> has largely shown the
Use of Medals<note n="g" place="margin">De Vsu Num. P. 859.</note> in Chronology, which
<hi>Du Fresne,</hi> and <hi>Foy-vaillant</hi> have since il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrated
by Example; the one, in the
<hi>Constantinopolitan</hi> Emperors; the other,
in the History of the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
to Medals; and a third has gone
so far, as from a few obscure Medals
of <hi>Herod</hi>'s Family, not only to call in
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:64296:77"/>
question the Authority, but by broad
Intimations, to suspect of Forgery,
both <hi>Iosephus,</hi> and several others of
our best Authors. But besides the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
from a dim Legend or Inscription,
where the least stroke, will alter the
Sense, or determine the Number very
differently; whoever considers, That
<hi>Annius</hi> of <hi>Viterbo</hi> could forge large Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories,
will surely not think it strange,
that we should have Forgeries in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals.
It is too certain, there have been
such, and the thing is so noted, that
some Medals are now as valuable, for
being exact Counterfeits, as others are,
for being truly Originals. And as to
Inscriptions, who knows not, that it
was generally the way of Flattery, to
Complement Princes and Great Men of
all sorts, with fulsome Elogies, and that
<hi>Domitian</hi>'s Medals and Inscriptions were
call'd in after his Death, because he had
not deserved such Honors? And tho' I
do really think the present <hi>French</hi> King
to be a Wise and Heroic Prince, yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
there are few, who would be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to take his History, from <hi>Menestrier</hi>'s
<hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. <hi>from Inscriptioes and Medals.</hi>

               <p>A Stranger to Geography, that should
read the Voyages of <hi>Vlysses</hi> or
<hi>Aeneas,</hi> as they are describ'd by the Poets,
and should observe the time that is
spent, the Removes that they make, and
dangers they undergo, in being toss'd
from Shore to Shore, would be apt to
imagine, they had visited most parts of
the habitable World; and yet it is plain,
one of them scarce went any further than
the Aegean-Sea, and neither of them ever
past the Mouth of the <hi>Streights:</hi> It is much
so, with our Ancient Geography, where
we have a great noise and little done.
The Poets were wise in stopping short of
the <hi>Straits,</hi> for had they launch'd out, and
led their Heroes beyond these Bounds,
they must have been in danger of being
lost, all beyond having been, <hi>Terra In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognita.</hi>
Nor can this seem strange in
the Poets, the Ancient Historians and
Geographers knew little farther; <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi>

further, who will needs have <hi>India</hi>
to confine upon the <hi>Straits,</hi> and <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi>'s
Pillars: And indeed it is so far true
that the <hi>Straits</hi> and <hi>India</hi> did border up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one another, as <hi>India</hi> seems to have
been a common name amongst the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
for Ignorance, for where they
knew no farther they call'd it, <hi>India:</hi>
of which <hi>Strabo</hi> tells us<note n="i" place="margin">Lib. 2.</note> all the Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers
that have writ have given us
nothing but lyes. I will not enter upon
a narrative of the mistakes of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,
and show how they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
places nearer home, and jumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Sea and Land together, how some
of them have mistaken the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi>
and joyn'd it with the <hi>Persian</hi> Sea: How
the Northern Seas have been made to
run into the <hi>Caspian,</hi> That is really a
Lake; and the <hi>Arabian,</hi> has been made
a Lake, that is well known to flow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Ocean: He that has a curiosity
may meet with a plentifull Harvest of
such mistakes, in <hi>Strabo</hi>'s three first
Books.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Strabo</hi> indeed has corrected many of
these mistakes, and has deliver'd things
down to us with g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ter accuracy:
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:64296:79"/>
But neither is he exact enough; he is
too much an Historian, to be a Good Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher,
and wanting Tables and Maps,
and the Longitudes and Latitudes being
things beyond his Skill, without which
it is scarce possible to fix places a right,
he must needs err for want of such
Helps to guide his Course: And the same
may be said of most of the rest of the
Geographers, before or soon after his
time.</p>
               <p>The honour of reducing Geography
to Art and System, was reserv'd to <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemy,</hi>
who by adding Mathematical ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
to the Historical Method in
which it had been treated of before, has
describ'd the World in a much more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible
manner. He has delineated it,
under more certain Rules, and by fixing
the bounds of places from Longitude
and Latitude, has both discover'd others
mistakes and has left us a Method of
discovering his own. What these are
I need not say, the most considerable
may be seen in <hi>Agathidaemon</hi>'s Map of
the World, which is printed with <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemy</hi>'s
Works, and is the first of its kind
now extant. A man may see there with
some pleasure, what Idea the Ancients
had of the World, after it was thought,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:64296:79"/>
to have been pretty plainly discover'd
by <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s labours: No very clear
one you may be sure; amongst other
mistakes, the situation of <hi>Britain</hi> is quite
mistaken, <hi>Scandinavia</hi> a large <hi>Peninsula,</hi>
is divided from the Continent, and
contracted into a poor narrow Island;
<hi>Africa</hi> is describ'd without bounds, and
no passage allow'd from the <hi>Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean</hi>
to the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> and it will not be
wondred, if the description of <hi>India</hi> be
remote from truth. Lesser errors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
in him; how many of this kind
have been detected by a late skilful Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher
<note n="i" place="margin">Cluvet. German. Antiq. Praef.</note> only in one of our <hi>European</hi>
Nations? And how many more might
be shown in the rest? And if he could
be so much deceiv'd, as he is, in the
Description of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> an Island near
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> and almost at his own door,
it will not seem strange, that he should
be more out in his accounts of <hi>Scandinavia</hi>
and <hi>Britain.</hi> It is certainly no commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
that the forecited Author, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
<hi>Pliny</hi>'s accounts to <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s, who has
not been very reputable for his accuracy
or truth, and that <hi>Strabo</hi> (in the Historical
part) is preferr'd to them both.</p>
               <p>We have had a Geography of late de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
all things from the <hi>Phoenician</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:64296:80"/>
which has appear'd with pomp
enough to dazzle men into an Opinion
thereof, and thereby to obtain Credit
and Reputation in the World. The
Author is a considerable Person, and one
who in order to establish his <hi>Phoenician</hi>
Antiquities, has successfully enough o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturn'd
those of the <hi>Greeks:</hi> But when
he comes to establish these Antiquities,
the first thing he complains of, is, want
of Monuments<note n="k" place="margin">Praef. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d Chan.</note> and therefore flies to
the <hi>Greeks</hi> to fetch them thence; so that
we are much in the same place, where
we were. However what are these
Monuments, which we meet with there?
By his own Confession only some loose
and broken Fragments, which seem to
disover little more, than in general,
that the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> made long voyages,
and visited remote Countries; and what
is that to us, if they have left us no
Charts or Journals, which they have
not done? So that at last, he usually
takes shelter in the derivation of a word,
or place, from a <hi>Phoenician</hi> Root, wherein,
tho' he has been happy enough in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures,
yet this way is principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural,
and too precarious to build a
Geography upon. If this be all, I will
undertake <hi>Goropius Becanus</hi> will go near
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:64296:80"/>
to do as much for the Dutch, <hi>Pere Pez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
for the <hi>Celtique,</hi> and almost every
Country, that pretends to an Original Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and has a fanciful man amongst
them, will do the like for their own
Nation. I am unwilling to oppose this
Author, for the sake of his Title, which
is <hi>Geographia Sacra,</hi> and shall readily
grant, nay it is what I contend for, that
as far as it is Sacred, it is likewise true;
but where he leaves <hi>Moses,</hi> he forsakes
his Guide, and wanders as much as the
<hi>Phoenicians</hi> ever did.</p>
               <p>I have no design to form a Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
betwixt the Ancients and Moderns,
they are both alike to me, but the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
in this, is too visible on the side
of the Moderns to be dissembled: They
have open'd a passage to a New World,
unknown to the Ancients, and those parts
of the Old, which have been thought
Unhabitable, have been found to be Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited;
and their Torrid Zone to be Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
enough, by refreshing Showers,
and constant Breezes, and cold Nights,
by the direct Setting of the Sun, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposition
of the whole Body of the
Earth. <hi>Antipodes,</hi> who have been the
Subject of so much Controversie, are to
us Matter of Fact, and the Globe it self
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:64296:81"/>
has been compassed with less noise by
<hi>Magellan</hi> and <hi>Drake,</hi> than the <hi>Phoenicians</hi>
and <hi>Greeks</hi> could Coast upon the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean.
However, least we should
swell too much upon our Discoveries,
there is yet World enough left undetect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be a Check upon our Ambition.</p>
               <p>I am not of his Opinion<note n="l" place="margin">La Mothe le Vayer, Vol. 1. P. 825.</note>, who thinks
that almost one half of the Terrestrial
Globe is yet undiscover'd, but by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
Computation, I suppose we may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot
a fourth part. That there is a vast
<hi>Southern</hi> Continent, as yet scarce look'd
into, is now past Centroversie; tho' I
much doubt, whether the further Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
would turn to great account; for
the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who pretend to have Sail'd to
the 64th. Degree of Southern Latitude,
have observ'd Mountains cover'd with
Snow; and no farther South than the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Bounds of <hi>America,</hi> the Straits of
<hi>Magellan</hi> are so Froze in <hi>April</hi>

                     <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi>'s Voyage, P. 15.</note>, that
there is then no passing that way for Ice:
So that much of the Country must be
cold and barren, answerable to our Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Climes on this side. The Northern
parts of <hi>America</hi> are yet undiscover'd, nor
can it be determin'd, till its Bounds that
way be laid open, whether it be a vast
Island, or a Contiment. <hi>Africa,</hi> tho' it
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:64296:81"/>
has been compass'd round and round
from the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> to the <hi>Red Sea,</hi>
yet little more than its Coasts are tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
known, except <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Abas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia;</hi>
its In-land parts have been either not
sufficiently view'd, or imperfectly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd,
neither the Merchants Gain, nor
the Missionaries Zeal having determin'd
their Pursuits to such rude and desolate
Countries. And as to <hi>Asia,</hi> what a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
Compass are we forc'd to fetch
about, to come at the extream Regions of
that Quarter of the World, most of which
might be sav'd, and a Voyage made with
half the Charge and Time, could a Passage
be discover'd by the North, to <hi>Tartary</hi> and
<hi>China:</hi> A Passage which has been often at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted,
but always with disappointment,
and sometimes with the loss of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers;
and is like to continue, a <hi>ne plus
ultra,</hi> to their most daring Endeavours:
Whether we consider the Dangers they are
expos'd to from rough Winds, in a Clime
intensly cold; or from Mountains of Ice,
which are the Rocks that are most fear'd in
those Seas; or the Difficulties in making
their way in thick Mists and Fogs; or
what may happen worse, in Nights of
some Months continuance, and no Moon
either to direct their Course, or give them
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:64296:82"/>
Light. To say nothing of a vast Ridge of
Mountains, which has been observ'd by our
late Missionaries<note n="n" place="margin">Le Compt. Memoir. Let. ult.</note> to stretch it self forth
into the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Sea, the Cape whereof
has never yet been doubled, and probably
never may; it being doubtful, whether these
Mountains may not reach to the opposite
Coast, and join <hi>America</hi> with the <hi>Asian</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent:
So that the bounds of <hi>Asia</hi> on that
side, as well as the opposite <hi>American</hi> Coast
have been hitherto hid from our Enquiries.</p>
               <p>There is one thing yet very lame in
our Geography, the fixing the true Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude
of places; and tho' several new
ways have been lately try'd, to redress
this Inconvenience, both from exact <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulums,</hi>
and from Observations upon the

to rectifie this Mistake, from the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical

neither could <hi>Vossius</hi> see into the strength
of such Arguments, and I much questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whether they would have obtain'd

Order<note n="q" place="margin">Avril. l. 2.</note> determin'd the Matter in a
more undeniable way, by opening a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
from <hi>Muscovy</hi> to <hi>China,</hi> and by
marking the several Stages, and showing,
from undoubted Relations, it was only a
Journey of so many Days. And yet the
difficulty is greater at Sea, which is not
capable of being so easily measured, and
where the Observations in our Telescopes
cannot be so regularly made, as they may
upon firm Ground; and there it is, the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits
<hi>themselves</hi> complain, they are at a loss.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vossius</hi> has assigned such a reason<note n="r" place="margin">Var. Observ. p. 169.</note> of
the variety in fixing the Longitude of the
<hi>Eastern</hi> part of the World, as may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

Speculations of this Nature. Upon the

                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:64296:83"/>
dispose of this new World to these two
Nations; and having divided it into two
Hemisphaeres, the Western Hemisphaere
he allotted to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
to the <hi>Portuguese;</hi> a Division which
the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>English</hi> have not thought
themselves obliged to submit to. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
the Division was made, but when
the Parties came to claim their respective
Shares, a Question presently arose about
fixing their Longitude, and the Pope's
having not been <hi>then</hi> Infallible in Matters
of <hi>Fact,</hi> especially in such as depend upon
Mathematical Calculations; the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were left to end the Controversie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
themselves. The great Contention
was about the <hi>Molucca</hi>-Islands, which the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> claim'd as theirs, and the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guese</hi>
pretended, fell within their share in
the Division, and Men of Skill being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
on both sides: the <hi>Spanish</hi> Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
went one way, and the <hi>Portuguese</hi>
went another, and so far were the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from coming to agreement, that they
differ'd almost forty Degrees in their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations,
which is a large proportion of the
whole Globe; and yet so obstinate were
both in their Accounts, that Orders were
given by public Edicts, that the Degrees
and Meridians should be no otherwise
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:64296:83"/>
fixt in their several Charts and Maps,
than as they have been determined by the
two Nations. How much the one side
was mistaken, has been since better
known, the Conclusion was, that whilst
the Longitude was determin'd, in such an
unaccountable manner, by public Edicts,
and absolute Power, it occasioned strange
confusion in our Degrees and Meridians,
of which <hi>Vossius</hi> thinks, we have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
since.</p>
               <p>But granting the Globe to have been
nicely measured, has it withal been as
accurately described? I doubt not. How

               <p>WE have certainly one great Proof
of the Excellency of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Laws, from the consent of those many
Nations, by whom they have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
and that too where there is no

have lived longer, and spread wider, than
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:64296:84"/>
their Arms ever did, and the Conquests
of their Wisdom have been greater than
those of their power. However, there
is only one perfect Law, a Character to
which no Humane Ordinance can have
any claim, and of which the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws
will be found upon Examination to fall
much short; notwithstanding the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Wisdom that they stand possess'd of.</p>
               <p>The Twelve Tables contain the first
Grounds of the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, and having

and Authority, than all the Books of
the Philosophers. We have only some
Fragments of them left Collected by
<hi>Baldwin</hi> and others; amongst which, as
there are some things hard, so that Law
which permits the Body of the Debtor
to be cut in pieces, and divided amongst
his Creditors, for want of Payment, is
not only Cruel but Barbarous. <hi>Baldwin</hi>
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Com. de Leg 12. Tab. c. 46.</note> himself cannot quote it without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation;

and <hi>Quinctilian</hi> who could
give a colour to most things, and as a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
was concern'd to do it in this, yet
where this Law comes in his way, rather
seeks to excuse it<note n="z" place="margin">Ap. Bald. ib.</note> than offers at its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
The best thing he says for it is,
that it was then antiquated, and as such
we leave it with the rest of that Set, and
pass on to those, that are now in force, the
Imperial or <hi>Iustinianean</hi> Laws, and will
see what Exceptions can be made to those.</p>
               <p>They are principally reducible to two
Heads, the <hi>Pandects</hi> and the <hi>Code,</hi> whereof
the first contains the Opinions of Learned
Lawyers; the other, the Decrees of <hi>Roman</hi>
Emperors. As to the Institutes, they usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
go along with the <hi>Pandects,</hi> and are
only a Compendium, or useful Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to young Beginners: and the Novels
are a Suppliment to the <hi>Code:</hi> The <hi>Feuds</hi>
are not of <hi>Roman</hi> Original, but Customs
of a later Date, and meaner Extraction.</p>
               <p>The Civilians who pretend that if the
Latin Tongue were lost, it might be
found in the Book of <hi>Pandects,</hi> would take
it ill to be thought mistaken in the Word
<hi>Pandect,</hi> which although a Masculine<note n="a" place="margin">H. Steph. de abus. Ling. Gr. p. 12.</note>,
is generally us'd by them in a Feminine
Signification: This is a light Error, only
it is in the Threshold. It will not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:64296:85"/>
the greatest part of the Pandects
are writ with purity enough, they have
that from the Authors, and the Age they
were writ in, and so much is own'd by
those Critics, who have been pretty se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
upon the other Tomes of the Law,
and therefore I shall make no Objection
here: No more than I shall, that the
Emperor by whose Order they were col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
is under no very advantageous
Character for Learning, that which <hi>Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
gives him being <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Man
that did not understand his Alphabet:
For tho' he were unlearned himself, he
might employ Men of Understanding, and
if <hi>Tribonian</hi> were such, who was the great
Instrument in that work, his Laws will
have no less Authority upon that account:
But so it happens, that <hi>Tribonian</hi>'s Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
is worse than the Emperor's, not for
his Understanding but Integrity, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
by the same Author<note n="b" place="margin">Suid. ad Tribon.</note> as a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Person, one that writ Laws and took
them away, and prostituted Justice for the
sake of Lucre, one that comply'd with his
Prince's Passions and Humors, and flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him almost to Adoration. I know <hi>Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>'s
Authority is suspected, in both these
instances, and therefore I should lay the
less weight upon it, did not <hi>Iustinian</hi> seem
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64296:86"/>
to countenance the charge in his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
<note n="c" place="margin">V. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitut. de Cod. conf. &amp; de Conc. Digest. ubi. <hi>Divina nostra, Numen nostrum,</hi> &amp;c.</note>, where he assumes such Titles
and Honors, as <hi>Tribonian</hi> is said to have
given him. However I charge nothing
upon this Emperor, I only cite his Words,
and leave others to judge of and reconcile
them.</p>
               <p>But whatever <hi>Tribonian</hi>'s other qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
were, I doubt we have too much
reason to blame his want of care, and to
suspect the Conception of the <hi>Pandects,</hi> as
well as the other Tomes of the Law, was a
hasty work, and not digested with that
accuracy, which a work of that vast im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
might justly require. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in his time the Books of the Law, had

had then swoln to that Bulk that they
were contain'd in 2000 Volumes, so many
as could not easily be read in some years,
much less compar'd and digested and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd;
<hi>Tri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>onian</hi> with his few Assistants
had overcome all these difficulties in a
short time, and in three years had fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
the <hi>Digest</hi> and <hi>Institutes,</hi> then added
to the first draught of the <hi>Code;</hi> which
last in all probability, having been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
too hastily, was forc'd to undergo
an Emendation and to come forth in a
second Edition. And doubtless the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:64296:86"/>
might likewise have been more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect,
had it cost more years, and had had
<hi>Trihonian</hi>'s second Care. The Emperor
himself seem'd surpriz'd with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatch,
for as before it was undertaken, he
styles it an infinite Work, such as none of
the former Emperors had ventured to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake,
or thought possible; so after it
was finish'd within the Compass of thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

do more visibly display themselves
here. For whereas, almost all the Books
of the Ancient Lawyers are now lost (the
blame whereof, if some Mens suspicions
may be credited, will fall heavy on the
Emperor or <hi>Tribonian</hi>) from whose la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
the <hi>Pandects</hi> were collected, and
therefore we are less able to Judge, of any
unfair dealing that has been shown there;
Many of the Emperor's Constitutions do
yet remain and have been preserved in the
<hi>Theodosian Code,</hi> from all which it is easie to
determine, what sort of treatment, the
Imperial Constitutions have met with, in
<hi>Tribonian</hi>'s new Compilation. Some of
the Constitutions have been alter'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Judgment, and others in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as betray no little ignorance in the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piler;</hi>
in some the words are struck out,
that determine the Sense of the Law, and

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:64296:87"/>
two are run into one; the time and date
are often mistaken, and sometime the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
the knowing of both which does af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
great light to a Constitution: With
other mistakes, which I should not have
ventur'd to have put down, had they
not been shown at large, in a Learned
Preface and more Learned Prolego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena
to the <hi>Theodosian Code:</hi> A Code
of such use to this day, that there
is no understanding <hi>Iustinian</hi>'s Law
without it; and formerly of such Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
that for several hundred years after
<hi>Iustinian</hi>'s time it did obtain<note n="g" place="margin">V. Seld. Dis. ad. Flet. c. 5. v. Pasq. Rech. l. 9. ch. 36.</note> in some
of the Western parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> when
<hi>Iustinian</hi>'s Law was in a manner extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd
and forgot, and must have been
in danger of perishing at least in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
part of it, the Pandects, had it not
been preserv'd, in the <hi>Pisan</hi> or <hi>Florentine</hi>
Copy, from which all our other Copies
<note n="b" place="margin">Ant. August. Emend. l. 1. c. 1.</note> have been taken; and is now us'd as
Law: So that by a strange Reverse of
things, <hi>Iustinian</hi>'s Law which for so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ages was lost or neglected, does now
obtain, and the Theodosian Code is in
a manner antiquited: The Theodosian
Code was the better Law, till the Reign
of <hi>Lotharius,</hi> when <hi>Iustinian</hi>'s Law begun
to revive; and now, it seems, <hi>Iustinian</hi>'s
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:64296:88"/>
Law is better than that, and Time, or
Chance, or Opinion shall determine their
worth. It is plain <hi>Iustinian</hi>'s Law had
not the same esteem at its birth, as it has
since acquir'd by Age, since it could go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
disuse so early after its conception, as to
make it a question, whether it obtained
its Course<note n="i" place="margin">Pasq. Rech. l. 9. C. 33.</note> in <hi>Iustinians</hi> own reign?
Or if it obtained then, as doubtless it
did, it kept its ground a short time till the
Reigns of <hi>Basilius</hi> and <hi>Leo,</hi> when <hi>Iustini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s
Law was Abridg'd and Reform'd by
those Emperors, as he had done by the
Laws before his own time; and these Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
Laws obtained in the East under
the Title of the <hi>Basilic Constitutions</hi>) till
the dissolution of that Empire, as the
<hi>Theodosian Code</hi> had done in the West. So
that if we might measure things by Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
or Duration, <hi>Iustinian</hi>'s Laws have not
yet been long liv'd, and what is more sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising,
it might perhaps be made a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
in what Sense they live now? For
if we will believe a noted Author, who
had reason to understand their Authority

               <p>After the Consideration of the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dects
and Code, if I should take in all
those large Volumes, that have been writ
upon them, I should make no end.
The first attempts of this kind were
pretty modest, only by explaining the
Text in short Glosses, which was <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursius</hi>'s
method: But he having not
had the assistances of Humane Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and particularly of the Greek Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,
the want of these have betray'd
him to gross and childish mistakes: And
it is a wretched Gloss, where a Sentence
of Greek occurs in the Text, <hi>Haec Graica
sunt quae nec legi nec intelligi possunt.</hi> And
yet his Authority is great in the Law,
much greater than that of his Son; of
whom it is said he never made a good
Gloss<note n="l" place="margin">V. Gry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiand. de Ins. p. 9, 10.</note>.</p>
               <p>Commentaries succeeded Glosses and
have swoln to a larger Bulk: In this
kind, <hi>Bartolus</hi> is of great name; whose
Authority is as much valu'd in some
Nations amongst the Modern Lawyers,
as <hi>Papinian</hi>'s was among the Ancients:
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:64296:89"/>
who, as he was to be follow'd, where
the Opinions of the Lawyers were equally
divided,<note n="m" place="margin">Duck de usu. l. 1. c. 8.</note> so <hi>Bartolus</hi>'s Opinions of late
have been of like force. He was confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly
an extraordinary Man, and might
have done more service in his Profession,
had he not liv'd under the same Infelici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of times, and wanted the same helps
that <hi>Accursius</hi> did, whereby he dash'd
against the same Rocks. It was from him,
we have had that noted and almost Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial
saying that has cast some reproach
upon the Law,<note n="n" place="margin">V. vit. Bart. ap. Freher.</note> 
                  <hi>De verbebus non curat
Iurisconsultus,</hi> and odd expression for an
Interpreter of that Law, one Title where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is, <hi>of the signification of Words:</hi> But this
was a Title, that he did not care to
meddle with, and which his Enemies
have charg'd him, with not daring to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.
Notwithstanding all his Faults,
he ought not to have been treated so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully
by <hi>L. Valla,</hi> and the Men of
Polite Letters; for however unpolish'd
he may be in his his Style, or nice or
obscure in expressions, or however igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
in History or Roman Customs, it
is certain, he is not that Goose and Ass,
that <hi>Valla</hi>
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Op. p. 632.</note> would make him; and
that he has more Law, tho the others may
have more Learning.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:64296:89"/>The Polite Men of this Set, who gave
the last turn to the Law, were <hi>Alciat, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacius,
Budaeus</hi> and others; they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
restor'd the Law to its primitive
Purity and Lustre, and cloath'd it in a
more Elegant Dress, and made that a
pleasant study, which in the hands of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolus</hi>
and <hi>Baldus</hi> was uncouth and rugged;
They have given it all the advantages of
Humane Learning, and ransackt all the
Stores of Arts and Sciences to fetch thence
Beauties to adorn it: But whilst they
have busied themselves in various Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and attended to too many thing at
once, they have been thought wanting
in the one main thing; and have had less
Law, than many of those whom they
censure and despise. <hi>Ant. Augustinus,</hi>
who should have been nam'd with the
first of this Rank and Order, does in a
manner confess the charge, and owns that
<hi>Budaeus</hi> whilst he had been too much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted,
in attaining the Tongues, had
made no great progress in the knowledge
of the Law. The most considerable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements,
that have been made by
these Men, have been principally upon
one Title, about <hi>the signification of Words,</hi>
in which, however they may have excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
they have been rewarded by <hi>Bartolus</hi>'s

               <p>One thing should not have been omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that has occasion'd no little obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and confusion: when the Law by
the Bulk and Number of Books that were
Writ, was grown too voluminous, a
way was taken up of contracting it into
a narrow Compass, by short Notes and
Abbreviations: This way was found to
be of such use and so compendious, that
it prevail'd much, but its inconvenience
was quickly discover'd from the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity
that such short Notes were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to, and therefore they were forbid
by a Constitution<note n="p" place="margin">Cod. l. 1. Tit. 17.</note> of <hi>Iustinian.</hi>
However the mischief was not so easily
remedy'd as forbid, for it still prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and that almost in <hi>Iustinian</hi>'s own
time, and some of them have crept into
the Florentine Pandects, which tho' not
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:64296:90"/>
so Ancient as <hi>Iustinian,</hi> (as some have
been of opinion, but whom this very
thing<note n="q" place="margin">V. Ant. Aug. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend. l. 1. c. 1.</note> does sufficiently confute,) yet
must be granted to have been writ soon
after; and at last they grew to that height,
and occasioned such Confusion and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity,
that several Treatises have been
writ to explain them; a Collection of
which, and a Specimen of the notes may
be had in <hi>Putschius.</hi> Even of late they
have been found so troublesome, that

               <p>I Have no design to bring contempt
upon the Ancient Canons, which
were doubtless, very well fitted for the
occasions of the Church in its purer A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
having been fram'd by Men of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Simplicity, in free and conciliar
Debates, without any ambitious Regards.
That which is justly complain'd of, is,
that these Canons are too much negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and a New sort of Discipline e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
in the Church, established upon
different foundations, and oft-times for
different ends with the former; which
is so notorious, that it has given occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to a distinction amongst some Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> betwixt
the Old and New Law: Especially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the French, who pretend that
the <hi>Gallican Privileges,</hi> are chiefly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
of the Ancient Canons, which
they have preserv'd against the Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Roman Pontif. For that
Prelate having taken advantage of the
fall of the Roman Empire, and of the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:64296:91"/>
confusion among his Neighbours, upon the
inundation of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> and
other Barbarous People; and of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that ensued thereon; made a pretty
easie shift to erect a New Empire, and for
its support it was necessary to contrive
and frame a New Law. I shall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
the several advances that were made
in the several Ages; <hi>Is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dore</hi>'s Collection was
the great and bold stroke, which tho', in
its main parts, it has been since discover'd
<note n="s" place="margin">V. Blond. Pseudo-Is. &amp; Tur. Vap.</note> to be as impudent a Forgery as ever
was, yet to this Day stands recorded for
good Authority in the Canon Law.</p>
               <p>The two principal parts of this Law,
are, the <hi>Decrees,</hi> and the <hi>Decretals,</hi> which, to
give them the greater face of Authority,
answer to the Pandects and Code in the
Civil Law: For as the Pandects contain
the Answers and Opinions of famous
Lawyers; and the Code, the Decrees
made and Sentences given by Emperors;
so the Decree consists chiefly of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of the Fathers and Definitions of
Councils; and the Decretals, of the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional
Sentences and Decrees of Popes.
As to the <hi>Clementines</hi> and <hi>Extravagants,</hi>
which may answer to the Novels, they are
only Suppliments to the other two parts,
and we have yet no Institutes in the Canon
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:64296:92"/>
Law. For as to <hi>Lancelottus</hi>'s Book of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes,
which Dr. <hi>Duck</hi> seems to make a
part of the <hi>Corpus,</hi> he is therein mistaken,
if it be his Opinion, for wanting Sanction

               <p>The Decree carries contradiction in its
very Title, being <hi>Concordantia Discordanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
Canonum,</hi> or a Concordance of disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
Canons: Or if there were none in
the Title, I doubt there are too many in
the Body of the Work, which have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
innumerable <hi>Glosses</hi> and busied the
Canonists in reconciling them. It having
been compiled by <hi>Gratian,</hi> in an Ignorant
Age, we ought not to be too nice in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
it, and perhaps it were unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to require too much accuracy, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
so much Ignorance; and therefore
if his Style in Latin be somewhat course,
or if in quoting a Greek Father or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
he mistakes their meaning, or gives a
wrong one, that might easily be forgiven
him, Greek being a Language, that was
not understood in that Age, and was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the misfortune of the time, than his
own: But then if he gives us such Fathers
and Councils as have no Being, or if he
mistakes a Father for a Council, or a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
for a Father; this surely is not so par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable,

never seen many of the Decrees and

trac'd his Authorities to their Fountains,
but having made use of others Collections,
it was impossible but he should fall into
mistakes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which are so numerous, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the names of Persons and Places,
that a Man had need of good skill in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,

him a right; and without such helps,
one may easily lose himself in travessing
the Decree.</p>
               <p>It might be expected that he should be
pretty exact in the names of Popes, these
being his Law-givers, whose Authority he
makes use of upon all occasions, and yet
even in these he sometimes miscarries, and
gives us such names as were never heard
of in Ancient Story. I can never read

               <p>The Decretals, tho' not altogether so
gross as the Decree, are more Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
having appear'd in the World,
when the Papal Power was grown to its
full height, and having been compiled by
<hi>Gregory</hi> IX, and consisting principally of
the Constitutions of <hi>Innocent</hi> III. the
first of whom wag'd almost a continual
War with an Emperor; and the latter
Subjugated a King, and call'd him his
<hi>Vassal,</hi> nothing better could be expected.
For tho several Conciliar Decrees and
Canons were intermix'd with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Constitutions, yet they are with such
Exceptions and Reservations to the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:64296:94"/>
Pope's dispensing Power and absolute
Dominion, that they became useless:
Popes were now become the Fountain
of all Power, and both Princes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils

That the Pontifical Authority is as much

there arising some difference, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the proportion of Magnitude, betwixt
these two Luminaries, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
betwixt these two other great Powers;
the Gloss does learnedly refer us, to
<hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s <hi>Almagest</hi> to adjust the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But I need not cite particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,
a good part of the Decretals
turning upon this point, and resolving all
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:64296:95"/>
into a Monarchical Power at <hi>Rome:</hi>
For which reason the five Books of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Doujat. Hist. du Droit Can. Par. 2. Ch. 15. 17.</note> have not yet been received in
<hi>France</hi> without Restrictions; no more
than the sixth Book of <hi>Boniface</hi> VIII. has
been.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Clementines,</hi> notwithstanding a
good part of them were given in a
pretended General Council at <hi>Vienne</hi> in
<hi>France,</hi> yet are no Conciliar Decrees,
only the Constitutions of <hi>Clement</hi> V.
Such having been the manner of some
of the late Western Councils, That the
Bishops were only Assessors or Advisers,
on at the most Assenters, and the Pope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
defin'd in a pretty absolute man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
and therefore they are not styl'd
Decrees of such a Council, only the
Constitutions of <hi>Clement</hi> in the Council
at <hi>Vienne.</hi> The <hi>Extravagants</hi> are tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
things, and want that Majesty,
which Brevity gives to Sanctions and
Decrees: Both they and the <hi>Clementines</hi>
have this besides, that having been
compil'd in the Scholastick Age of the
Church, they are mixt with Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Questions, and are as much Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:64296:95"/>Nor is the Gloss better than the Text,
which, however it be of great Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
among the Canonists, yet it may
be justly question'd, whether it deserves
so much? For to take things as they
rise and to go no further than the first
Page of the Decree: <hi>Gratian</hi> having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
his Book very properly, by distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
betwixt the several sorts of Right,
and having said that <hi>Ius,</hi> was so called
because it was <hi>Iust.</hi> The Gloss upon
this observes, that there is a Right that
is neither Equitable nor Just<note n="e" place="margin">Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doque est aliquod jus, quod non est ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quum nec justum. <hi>Dist.</hi>
                  </note> and
produceth Instances, that are neither
pertinent, nor prove the Point; and
then concludes, that in all Cases upon
a Reason and for publick Good, Rigor is
induc'd against natural Equity, and in
some Cases without a Reason. Take
another Instance upon the Decretals,<note n="f" place="margin">Lib. 1. Tit. 1.</note>
which beginning with the Symbol, of
our Faith: upon that the Author of the
Gloss enquires into the Nature of Faith,
and having pass'd the Apostle's account,
as an imperfect Definition, gives a much
more insufficient one of his own; for
which he is justly chastiz'd by <hi>Erasmus:</hi>
And as for the word Symbol that
should not seem to be over difficult, he
derives it from, <hi>Syn,</hi> and <hi>Bolus,</hi> which
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:64296:96"/>
in the Language of the Gloss does sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie,
<hi>Morsellus;</hi> and then enquiring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the number of Symbols, he adds a
fourth to the other three; for no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that I can see, unless it were that
they might answer to so many Gospels.
Besides other less mistakes upon the same
Title, which I pass over, because the
same Gloss says, that, <hi>Modicum quid non
nocet,</hi> and cites the Decretals<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 5. Tit. 3. c. 18.</note> for it,
where <hi>modica res,</hi> is said not to induce
Simony; and yet the <hi>Modica Res,</hi> there
mention'd, is a Horse.</p>

                  </gap>e, and therefore I pass them
over, and indeed they generally keep to
their Text, and run out upon the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Pope, to the great Diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Councils or indeed of any other
Authority: And whereas in that large
Collection of Tracts that was publish'd
at <hi>Venice,</hi> there are two gross Volumes
concerning the Power of Popes, and their
Cardinals; it is very observable that there
is scarce any thing said of Councils, unless
by such, as will be sure to subject them
to the Pope. That Haughty Bishop is
their darling Theme, and one of them
has gone so low, as to write a Tract,<note n="g" place="margin">

I insist upon the differing Opinions and
Constitutions in the Decree and Decretals,
in how many things they interfere and
cross, and in how many more, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
the Civil Law. <hi>Baptista à Sancta

               <note place="bottom">That I may do all Right to the Canon Law, it must be

               <p>It is doubtless ancient, Men's necessity
and desire of Health did put them early
upon this search, and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> who
liv'd 2000 years ago has left a Treatise
concerning <hi>ancient Physic;</hi> so that it was
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:64296:97"/>
ancient in his time. But the Physic then
in use was chiefly Emperical, <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
brought in the Rational way, and
what he did in this Art, did so far surpass
others labours, that their Works are in

who was then a Modern, is to us a

some things, so he follows him in the

main, and both in explaining his Author;
and where he gives us his own Sentiments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
is somewhat tedious; he tires and distracts
his Reader as much by being too large,
as the other does, by saying too little,
which yet might be excus'd, had he in
so many gross Volumes and different Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises,
left us a Compleat Body of Physic.
But this he is so sar from having done, that
it scarce seems to have been in his design;
most of his pieces having been under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
with particular views, either to
gratifie Friends, or as helps of memory,
or exercises of invention. His Anatomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Pieces, which have been cry'd up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
measure, have been less admir'd,
since nicer Observations have been made
in Anatomy, than he was capable of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king;
and those which he has made, are
often erroneous, for want of Comparative
Anatomy, in comparing and distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
betwixt the Bodies of Men and Brutes:
Most of his Observations having been
made upon the latter, and it being que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable,
whether he ever saw the disse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of a Human Body. Even his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
<hi>De Vsu Partium</hi> has been censur'd, as
in many things grounded upon Inferences
of his own, rather than upon Observations
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:64296:98"/>
from Experience and View; and the Parts
are described there in such order, as none
will think fit to imitate, unless any Man
can find method, in beginning with the
hand and proceeding to the Foot, and so
up again to the Belly. And tho he has
been remarkable for his care and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Life, which he has express'd,
as in other Instances, so particularly in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against publishing exquisite Treatises
of the Nature of Poysons, yet I question
whether it will be thought another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of it, that he sometimes took away
six pounds of Blood<note n="m" place="margin">De cur and. Rat. per Sang. mis. cap. 14.</note> in a Fever:
And bled his Patients, till by fainting
they could bear no longer, for which he
was twitted in his own time, as appears
from his Books<note n="n" place="margin">De Meth Med. l. 9. c. 4.</note> and was said to work
Cures by muthering Diseases.</p>
               <p>Whatever faults he had must have been
deriv'd upon his Successors, for as he
commented upon <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> so the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Physicians have copy'd <hi>Galen.</hi> The
Greeks <hi>Oribasius, Aegineta,</hi> and <hi>Aetius</hi> have
in a manner transcribed him; and <hi>Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>en</hi>
and the Arabians have done little
more, than translate <hi>Galen</hi> into their own
Tongue: And their Translations having
not been over Faithful, and the Version
double; first from the <hi>Greek</hi> to the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bic,</hi>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:64296:99"/>
and from that back again into the
Latin, they cannot be depended upon
without eminent hazard, especially in the
names of Drugs and Plants, where the
mistake in a word, may endanger a Life.
They were subtle Men, and most of them
Logicians, accordingly they have given
method, and shed subtilty upon their Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
and little more can be said for them.</p>
               <p>The Chymists have appear'd with so
much Ostentation, and with such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the Arabians and <hi>Galen,</hi> that we
have been made to expect Wonders from
their performances. <hi>Paracelsus</hi> who
would be thought the Head of a Sect, has
treated the Galenists so rudely, as if they
were the most ignorant Men in the world,
and had little skill beyond a Plaster or a
Purge: Tho neither ought he, to have
vaunted so much of his Discoveries; One
of his great Admirers<note n="o" place="margin">Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont. Chym. Princ.</note> having shown,
that some part of his skill was stole: And
it is some prejudice against him, that a
Man who pretended to such immortal
Remedies, should himself die in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
seventh year, whereas <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and
<hi>Galen</hi> are said to have lived beyond a
Hundred.</p>
               <p>If there be any thing certain in Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
it ought to be their first Principles,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:64296:99"/>
which the Chymists have substituted in
the place of others, which they have
thought fit to explode; and pretend that
theirs are so evident from the <hi>Analysis</hi> of
Bodies, that there can be no room for
doubt; and yet whereas at first we had
only three of these Principles, their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
is already swoln to five, and who
knows whether they may stop there? Or
whether their practice be better ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
than the Principles they go on? For
tho great Cures have been effected by
Chymical prescriptions, and those too in
a manner less cloying and nauseous, than
the former practice would admit of, by
separating the Faces, with which the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenical
Medicines are clog'd; yet the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
will be, whether they be not attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with other inconveniences? Whether
they be equally safe, and have no dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
consequences to discourage their use?
It will not be deny'd that the Chymical
Preparations are more vigorous and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
in their effects than the Galenical are,
and often work such Cures, as the other
gross Medicines have not activity enough
to effect: But then, as their activity is
great, is not the danger so too? And does
not the same power, that enables them
to heal, empower them to destroy? And
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:64296:100"/>
whilst the Cures are recorded, are not
the miscarriages forgot? Have not our
Enterprising Chymists sometimes preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
life, only to make it the more mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable?
And sav'd their Patients by ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Constitutions? Have not their
strong <hi>Opiats</hi> often disorder'd the Head?
And their too free use of <hi>Mercury, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi>
&amp;c. the whole habit of the Body?
If such Cures be offer'd me, I hardly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
them. He is the true Physitian,
who attends to all possible Consequences,
who does not heal one Disease, by procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
us a worse, but restores such a life as
a Man can enjoy; but where shall this
Perfect Man be found?</p>
               <p>Some have gone as far as <hi>China</hi> to find
him out, of which People's skill such
Wonders have been reported, as the
Chymists themselves can hardly pretend
to. The Circulation of the Blood, which
with us is a Modern Discovery, has been
known there according to <hi>Vossius</hi>
                  <note n="p" place="margin">Var. Ob. servat. p. 70. 71.</note> 4000
years, they have such skill in Pulses as is
not to be imagin'd, but by those that are
acquainted with them; and the Arabians
are there said, to have borrow'd thence
their knowledge in Physic. Even the
Missionaries who have reason to know
them best, grant, that there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:64296:100"/>
surprising in their skill of Pulses,
<note n="q" place="margin">Le Let. 8.</note> tell us they have made observation in
Medicine 4000 years; and that when all
the Books in <hi>China</hi> were ordered to be
burnt by the Emperor <hi>Chiohamti,</hi> those in
Physic were preserv'd by a particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
But yet they likewise acquaint
us, that most of their skill is built upon
Observations, which have not been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd,
to such purposes as they would
have been by the Europeans; and that
for want of Philosophy and Anatomy
the great Foundations of Medicine, their
Notions are confus'd, and their Practice
in some things ridiculous. The <hi>Chinese</hi>
are an unaccountable sort of People,
strangely compounded of Knowledge and
Ignorance; they have had Printing among
them, and Gun-Powder, and the use of
the Compass, long before they came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Europeans; and yet for want
of due improvement, these useful Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
have not turn'd to any great account;
and Physic has had the same Fate. So
that after all our Travel, the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
improvements in this Art, are
most probably to be found at home; and
being so near, need not be much enquir'd
into.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:64296:101"/>We have generally Men enough ready
to publish discoveries whether real or
pretended, whilst deficiencies in most
Arts are often conceal'd or pass'd by in

some years about Transplantation of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases,

Nation. The retrieving the Ancient

should think scarce capable of being
prov'd; for neither are the Spirits them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

any Ligature or Tumor in the Nerve
discover their Motion. The Circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:64296:101"/>
and Men have been look upon as dull,
that will not see it. I will not question

               <p>The most considerable real Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that have been lately made, have
been in Anatomy, and Botany: no

in the inward parts of our Bodies, as we

sufficiently stor'd with Plants, and we
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:64296:102"/>
have made a tolerable shift, to reduce them
to <hi>Classes,</hi> and to describe them by Marks
and Signatures, so far as to distinguish
them from one another: But as their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteristic
marks are known, are their
Virtues so too? I believe no Man will
venture to affirm it. The qualities of
many of our Plants and Simples are yet
in the dark, or so uncertain in their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
that they are rather matter of
Curiosity, than Subjects of Skill: Or
where some of their Vertues are too
remarkable to be conceal'd, yet they
act one way singly, and quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in Mixture and Composition; or
they may have one effect, when out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
applied, and a quite different
one when taken inwardly, after they
have undergone so many alterations in
the Blood and Stomach, as they must
do, before they can reach the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected;
and they may again vary, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the different temper of the
Bodies, to which they are applied. It
is not enough to say, their natures may
be known by being Chymically resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
for their effects are often very
disproportionable to the principles and
parts that result from the <hi>Analysis;</hi> there
are other parts more subt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, and yet
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:64296:103"/>
most active and vigorous in their Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that act upon the Spirits, as the gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
part do upon the Blood and Humors,
and those the subtilest Chymists, and the
most exquisite <hi>Analysis</hi> will not be able
to reach.</p>
               <p>In short, whether we consider our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
or our Medicines, Physic must be
the most uncertain thing imaginable:
Our Bodies are more compounded and
unequal than other Bodies are, most o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Creatures live upon a simple Diet,
and are regular in their Appetites; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Man feeds almost upon every thing,
Flesh and Fish, Fruits and Plants, from
the Fruit of our Gardens to the Mush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom
upon the Dunghil; and where
Appetite fails, the Invention is call'd in
to swell the Account; high Sauces and
rich Spices are fetch'd from the <hi>Indies,</hi>
which occasion strong Fermentations and
infinite disorder in the Blood and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours:
Hence proceed such variety of
Diseases as perplex and distract the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician's
Skill. A sound Body and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Constitution is easily restor'd when
out of order, Nature in a great measure
does its own work, (a noted instance
whereof, we have in <hi>Cornaro</hi> in <hi>Lessius,</hi>
who by regularity and temperance had
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:64296:103"/>
brought an infirm Body to such a temper,
that he was not troubled with any Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
and any wound in him would in
a manner heal it self) whereas in a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered
Body, every little thing is Wound
and Disease, and a Physician must give
a new Constitution, before he can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
a Cure; this is a hard tryal upon
our Physician, and yet by our way of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
we often require it.</p>
               <p>It is the harder, because his Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
and Methods of Cure will not ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
him to work Wonders; For tho' our
<hi>Materia Medica</hi> be large enough, and to
look into our Dispensatories, one would
think no Disease incurable, yet the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
of it is, all those fine Medicines, do
not always answer in the Application,
nor have they been found so Soveraign
in our Bodies, as they are in our Books.
All which things have so distracted our
Physicians, that they vary even in the
most common Methods: At one time
they keep their Patients so close and warm,
as almost to stifle them with care, and all
on a sudden the Cold <hi>Regimen</hi> is in vogue;
In one Age <hi>Alkalies</hi> are in fashion, and in
the next <hi>Acids</hi> begin to recover Credit;
<hi>Antimony</hi> at one time is next to Poyson,
and again, the most innocent thing in
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:64296:104"/>
the World, if duly prepared; Bleeding
is practis'd in one Nation, and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by their Neighbours; some People are
prodigal of their Blood, and others so
sparing, as if so much Life and Blood
went together; <hi>Helmont</hi> and his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are for the latter way, <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>
and their Followers, encourage the
former: and all of them, as you will ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
with equal assurance.</p>

               <p>CRiticism as it is usually practis'd, is
little more than an Art of finding
Faults, and those commonly little ones too,
and such as are of small importance to the
Scope and Design of an Author. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Bayle</hi> was sensible of this, whose first
design was to publish a Dictionary of
Faults, but was diverted from his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
by his Friends representing to him,
that they were not considerable enough to
be insisted on: And yet he had that to say
for himself, that they were such as were
taken notice of by <hi>Scaliger</hi> and other noted
Critics, either some mistake in a Name,
Time, Place, or other minute Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
The truth of it is, Criticism is at
a low Ebb, Men will be finding faults in
Authors, and yet our store is well near ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted,
for there are few Faults in this
kind, that have not been taken notice of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Erasmus</hi> and the first set of Critics had
Matter enough to work upon, a long
Age of Ignorance had cut out sufficient
Employment, by vicious Copies and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:64296:105"/>
Spurious from Genuine Authors;
the distinguishing of which was a Work
of Use and Skill: But after the Business
is pretty well done, the Vein of Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising
still continues; Men will play at
small Games rather than want Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
so that our Modern Critics have
usually either degenerated into Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
or if they soar higher, it is too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
by venturing too freely upon those
Books, which ought to be handled with
greater tenderness: Their business some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
is in finding Faults, where there
are none, or in perverting the Sence, that
they may make room for Correction.
And for as much as these Men do find
Faults with all the World, they have no
reason to take it amiss, if one who is none
of their Number, does find one or two,
in them. I shall seek for no more (nor
have I room in the compass of a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
but they shall be in two Critics of
Name; one of whom has writ the <hi>Art of
Criticism,</hi> the other, <hi>A Critical History of
the Old and New Testament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The former, Monsieur <hi>le Clerc,</hi> is as
free in his Censures, as any Man I ever
met with, and oft times as Unhappy:
He begins with <hi>Erasmus,</hi> for I take the
first thing I meet with, whom he expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:64296:105"/>
                  <note n="t" place="margin">Ars Crit. cap. 1. p. 13. Ed. Lond.</note> as ignorant in Geography, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

<hi>Rhegium,</hi> a City in <hi>Italy,</hi> for a Town in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily;</hi>
and for having took <hi>Melita</hi> an Island,
either for <hi>Mitylene</hi> a City; or the same
Island, that is situate in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi>
or <hi>African</hi> Sea, for an obscure Island in the
<hi>Adriatic:</hi> and then falls foul on him, as a
Man that had scarce ever seen a Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
Map. It seem'd very strange to me,
that <hi>Erasmus</hi> who is known to have writ
his Commentaries upon the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
with the Map of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire
always before him, should be guilty of such
Errors in Geography, and therefore I had
the curiosity to consult the Author: I have
not so bad an Edition of <hi>Erasmus,</hi> as Mons.
<hi>Le Clerc</hi> quotes, but I consulted the worst
Edition I could meet with; in that, he is so
far from placing <hi>Rhegium</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> that he
expresly says, it is a City in <hi>Italy,</hi> and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
St. <hi>Ierome</hi> for having been guilty of
so gross a mistake: And as to <hi>Melita</hi> the
Island, he directly distinguisheth it from
<hi>Mitylene</hi> the City, which Island he placeth
betwixt <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> a Situation ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
different from that, which Monsieur <hi>Le
Clerc</hi> endeavours to fasten upon him.</p>
               <p>Monsieur <hi>Le Clerc</hi> in the next place is
angry with <hi>Erasmus</hi> for quoting <hi>Hugo
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:64296:106"/>
Carrensis,</hi> being an Author of no Credit,
and one who liv'd in the Scholastic Age,
and seems to think he was led into his
Mistake, by trusting so mean an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
It is true, <hi>Erasmus</hi> does quote <hi>Hugo
Carrensis,</hi> but it is only to make sport with
him, as he does sometimes with the
Scholemen, and Monsieur <hi>Le Clerc</hi> need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not have gone above ten Lines further
for a convincing Proof of this, where <hi>Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
calls upon his Reader to laugh<note n="u" place="margin">In Act. Apost. c. 28. v. 11.</note> at
<hi>Hugo Carrensis</hi> for his Critical Observation
upon the Sign of <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well! But <hi>Erasmus</hi> is not yet clear of
Monsieur <hi>Le Clerc,</hi> for he remembers, that
<hi>Erasmus</hi> somewhere in his Notes upon St.
<hi>Ierom</hi>'s Epistles, mistakes the City <hi>Mity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene</hi>
for the Island <hi>Melita,</hi> only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> he forgets
the particular place, but it is somewhere,
where St. <hi>Ierome</hi> mentions St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack:
I always suspect a Man where he
forgets the place, and therefore I will help
his Memory; it is in St. <hi>Ierome</hi>'s Epistle
to <hi>Oceanus</hi> in the first Tome of <hi>Erasmus</hi>'s
Edition; where, if <hi>Erasmus</hi> reads <hi>Mitylene</hi>
I suppose it was only because, it was the
same word, which was us'd by his Author
St. <hi>Ierome,</hi> for both of them make it an
Island and expresly the same where S. <hi>Paul</hi>
suffered Shipwrack, and without questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:64296:106"/>
the same, that <hi>Erasmus</hi> meant in his
Notes upon the <hi>Acts.</hi> If <hi>Erasmus</hi> be to
be blam'd in any thing, it is for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
St. <hi>Ierome,</hi> read <hi>Mitylene</hi> instead
of <hi>Melita,</hi> for in all the <hi>MSS.</hi> that I
have seen of that Father, and I have
seen more than one, the reading is, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lita:</hi>
But I dare say that is more than
<hi>M. Le Clerc</hi> knows. <hi>Erasmus</hi> may have
had mistakes in Criticism, for tho' he tells
us of himself, that his care in publishing
St. <hi>Ierome</hi> was such, that it cost him almost
as much pains, in restoring his Works,
as it did the Author in writing them;
yet <hi>Marianus Victorius</hi>
                  <note n="x" place="margin">Epist. Pio Quarto</note> pretends to
have made 1500 Corrections upon him
barely in the Edition of that Father;
and the <hi>Benedictines,</hi> no doubt, have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
more. But as for <hi>M. Le Clerc</hi>'s at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks,
I dare be confident, they will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hurt St. <hi>Ierome,</hi> nor any of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors;
tho' he falls as foul upon the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictines,</hi>
as he does upon <hi>Erasmus.</hi> He
would gladly make the World believe,
that they understand not Greek, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they pretend less that way, and
therefore their chief care hitherto has been
in the Latin Fathers, in which they have
deserv'd great Commendation: But as
to <hi>M. Le Clerc</hi>'s Critical observation<note n="y" place="margin">Tom. 2. cap. 13.</note>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:64296:107"/>
which he passeth upon them with so much
Contempt, it is so far short of proof to me,
that I cannot but think their mistake bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than his Correction, I am sure more
agreeable to St. <hi>Ierome</hi>'s meaning.</p>
               <p>He has past the same censure in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

to task, he has caught him tripping in his
Greek, where all things were plain, and
tells us he has shown it in his Notes upon
<hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Clemens.</hi> For my part I can
meet with no material Corrections upon
either of these Authors, and the only
thing he chargeth him with in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
is, That he renders, <gap reason="foreign">

which in <hi>M. Le Clerc</hi>'s opinion,
should be <hi>summatim,</hi> which in reading our
Animadverter, a Man, would think <hi>Cote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius</hi>
had done, either in <hi>Barnabas</hi> or <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>'s
Epistles. I have read over hastily
these three Epistles; I will not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positive,
but I am pretty confident, the
word does not occur in any one of the
three; and if it be to be met with in the
<hi>Clementines,</hi> it is nothing to the Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's
purpose; for we are not to expect to
meet always with Classical Greek there,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:64296:107"/>
or with words, always in the sense of
Classical Authors. <hi>Cotelerius</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Barnab. Es. p. 1.</note> has
rendred the Verb <gap reason="foreign">

Clerc</hi> would have it; and if he have
rendred the Adverb otherwise, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
it was not from mistake, but judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Had <hi>M. Le Clerc</hi> consider'd, that
there is a sort of Ecclesiastical Greek,
very different from the Classical, he
would have been more reserv'd in his
Censures. But this is a sort of Greek,
wherewith he seems not to be much
acquainted. St. <hi>Ierome,</hi> who understood
this sort of Greek better than ei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and tho' <hi>M. Le Clerc</hi> should
oppose, I must think St. <hi>Ierome</hi> a good
Translator.</p>
               <p>Our Historian is a Critic of a higher
form, but sets out as unfortunately as <hi>M.
Le Clerc</hi> has done: To recommend the

Jewish Rabbins, who were his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors;
and this Father <hi>Simon</hi> knows very
well: But as to the Father's two Ladies,
I can assure him, there were none of that
name that understood a word of either
Language: for <hi>Sunnia</hi> and <hi>Fretella</hi> were
two Learned Men of St. <hi>Ierom</hi>'s Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
Somewhat of this was observ'd
by a Friend of <hi>Vossius</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Let. a M. Iustel.</note>: and if Father
<hi>Simon</hi> have any doubt of the thing,
I have that Epistle now before me in
two very fair <hi>Manuscripts;</hi> in both which
it is, <hi>Dilectissimis Fratribus Sunniae &amp; Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellae.</hi>

it is always ominous to stumble at the

I will only Note one other,
which an Englishman has better oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
of examining than other Men
have. Father <hi>Simon</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Hist. Crit. du N. T. c. 30, 31, &amp;c. Hist. des vers. c. 3, 5, &amp;c.</note> has not taken
more pains upon any one Subject, than
he has done upon the ancient Manuscript
<hi>Cambridge</hi> Copy of the Gospels and Acts
of the Apostles, and two other Manuscript
Copies of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles; the one in
the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Library; the other
in the Library of the <hi>Benedictines</hi> of St.
<hi>Germain:</hi> In the Latin Copies, of which
he thinks he has discover'd the Ancient
Vulgar Latin, as us'd in the Western
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:64296:110"/>
Church, before St. <hi>Ierom</hi>'s time, to whom
we owe the Vulgar now in use. I should
be as glad, and would go as far to meet
with the Ancient Vulgar of the New
Testament, as any Man shall do; but
cannot be of Opinion, that Father <hi>Simon</hi>
or <hi>Morinus</hi> have met with it in these
<hi>Manuscripts.</hi> For to speak only to the
<hi>Cambridge</hi> Copy: Any one that has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
that <hi>Manuscript,</hi> knows, that the
Latin Copy answers the Greek so exactly,
that there are very few various Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
So that if the Latin be Ancient, as
the Vulgar undoubtedly was almost as
Ancient as the Preaching of the Gospel at
<hi>Rome,</hi> the Greek probably is so too; and
it will hardly be imagin'd, that had there
been a Latin Copy so exactly agreeing
with the Greek Original, before St. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi>'s
time, that he would have ventur'd
upon, or have thought a new Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
necessary. St. <hi>Ierom</hi>'s manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
the Ancient Vulgar was, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
and reducing it to the Greek Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal:
but here was a Copy already, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
with the Greek. If it be said,
the Greek in that Man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>script may be a
more Modern Copy, but still before St. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi>'s
time, and that the Latin is translated
from it: This may be true; but then the
Latin is no longer the Ancient Vulgar, but
a later Version.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:64296:111"/>There is one pretty probable way of
trying it, by comparing the Citations in
the New Testament, with the same Texts,
as they stand in the Ancient Vulgar, in
the Old. This I have done in the <hi>Psalms,</hi>
and am far from meeting with any exact
agreement: The same Observation will
hold, in the Old Ecclesiastical Writers, as
far as the Vulgar can be trac'd there; and
I believe <hi>Hilary</hi> the Deacon, who has been
noted for keeping closest to the Old Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation,
will be no exception to this Rule.
Had Father <hi>Simon</hi> been as quick and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in observing Differences, as he has
been in marking Agreements, perhaps he
would not have been so hasty in drawing
his Conclusion: In many things there is
an agreement betwixt the Ancient and
Modern Vulgar, but no Man will conclude
from thence that they are the same.</p>
               <p>Father <hi>Simon</hi> truly observes<note n="f" place="margin">Hist. N. T. c. 30.</note>, that
the Greek in these <hi>Manuscripts,</hi> is very
faulty, and grounds an Argument there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
that they could not for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
be brought from <hi>Greece.</hi> Had that
Father had a Copy of the Latin Version
of the <hi>Cambridge</hi> Manuscript, as he has
of the Greek, he would have found, that
the Latin is the more faulty of the two;
and that not only in the Orthography,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:64296:111"/>
but Concord. For what would he think
of <hi>Hic verbus,</hi> Joh. <hi>c. 21. v.</hi> 23. Or of,
<hi>Retiam, v.</hi> 6. and repeated, <hi>v.</hi> 8. Or of,
<hi>Cumesset in Mesopotamiam posteaquam mortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
esset in Charris,</hi> instead of, <hi>Prius quam
moraretur in Charan:</hi> Act. 7. <hi>v.</hi> 2. Or of,
<hi>Esset ei Filium, v.</hi> 5. Or of, <hi>Iustitias coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisset
cum genus nostrum, v.</hi> 19? All which
mistakes are to be met with in two Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and more, which I forbear to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as I do to translate those I have
mention'd because I would not uncover
the nakedness of this Version. But tho'
mistakes of this kind be so common, as
to occur pretty frequently in this Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script,
yet they are not very agreeable
to the Style of the Ages before St. <hi>Ierom.</hi>
We have enough left us of the Ancient
Vulgar, to enable us to judge of its Style,
by all the Remainders of it we have,
tho' it has not Elegancy, which it did not
affect, yet it appears to have been writ
with tolerable Purity; whereas the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
we are now speaking of, is uncouth
and rude, and almost barbarous.</p>
               <p>What then shall we think of it?
Whatever the Version is, or whenceso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it is taken, the <hi>MS.</hi> it self seems to
be <hi>Gothic;</hi> and probably both are of the
same Extraction, and were done after
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:64296:112"/>
St. <hi>Ierom</hi>'s Time, when the <hi>Goths</hi> had
over-run the Empire; and Father <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>billon</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">De Re. Diplom. p. 347.</note> the greatest Judge of <hi>MSS</hi> of
this Age, sets the second part of this <hi>MS.</hi>
no higher. We have already seen the

these Times, and Dr. <hi>Marshal</hi>

the <hi>Gothic</hi> Gospels has observ'd such
an agreement betwixt those Gospels and
the <hi>Cambridge MS,</hi> that he thinks them
to be taken from the Greek of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py;
and this agreement he has shown
in several particular Texts. The Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
in that <hi>MS</hi> are many of them <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thic,</hi>
and Father <hi>Simon,</hi> who thinks he
has met with Greek Letters in the Latin
Copy of the Second Part of this <hi>MS,</hi> and
Grounds an Argument upon it, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
mistaken, for they are only
<hi>Gothic</hi> Characters several of which have
a great affinity with the Greek: The
Abbreviations are often the same in the
<hi>Cambridge MS</hi> and <hi>Gothic</hi> Gospels, and
the Numbers express'd by Numeral Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
ϊ and γ̈ are sometimes pointed, and
ει, for ι, put down after the <hi>Gothic</hi> way;
and <hi>Eusebius</hi>'s Canons are plac'd in the
Margin, in a rude manner, without
Marks of Distinction to make them use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
with other <hi>Gothisms,</hi> that might be
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:64296:112"/>
observ'd, did I design this, for any more
than a Hint or Specimen. One thing is
too observable to be passed over, that
whereas our Saviour's Genealogy in
St. <hi>Luke,</hi> is placed in Columns in the
<hi>Gothic</hi> Gospels, it is put down in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
same manner in the <hi>Cambridge MS,</hi>
which is the more remarkable, because
the rest of that <hi>MS</hi> is writ in long
Lines, and the Words run into one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
From all which, one would
be apt to infer, That this Copy was
taken under the <hi>Goths,</hi> that it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of the Ancient and Modern
Vulgar, which were both of them in
use in the <hi>Gothic</hi> Churches, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
in <hi>Spain</hi> two or three Centuries
after St. <hi>Ierome</hi>'s Time; tho' in many
things it differs from them both; as it
needs must, whilst it keeps so close to a
Greek Copy much differing from any
Copy, either Printed or Manuscript that
we now have. It has been taken from
a Copy fitted for Ecclesiastical use: For
that it has been taken from such a Copy,
appears from the <gap reason="foreign">

the Conclusion of a Reading. That

been observ'd by Father <hi>Simon</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Hist. N. T. Ch. 33.</note>, and
he needed only have apply'd them to
this Manuscript, to have shewn it to
have been taken from a Copy of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
I am so far satisfy'd, of its ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been taken from such a Copy, that
I once thought it, to have been fitted for
the Churches of the Greek Empire, when
both Greek and Latin were spoke there,
as they were from <hi>Constantine,</hi> till after <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinian;</hi>
in like manner, as they yet have
the Bible in two Tongues in such pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
where the People are of two Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages:
But I think I have reason to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
my Opinion.</p>
               <p>What Father <hi>Simon</hi> further conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
concerning the <hi>French MSS</hi> of
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles being the Second Part
of the <hi>Cambridge</hi> Copy, is undoubtedly
true of one of them; For besides that

Testament, at the end of one of these,
<hi>MSS</hi>
                  <note n="h" place="margin">Morin. l. 1. Exerc. 2. c. 3.</note>, the Gospels are placed in the

<hi>Cambridge</hi> Copy, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> immediately
after St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and the agreeableness
in the Character betwixt the <hi>Cambridge</hi>
and <hi>Benedictine</hi> Copy, according to the
Specimen of it, we have in <hi>Mabillon</hi>
                  <note n="i" place="margin">P. 347.</note>.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:64296:113"/>
There is a Fragment of St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s last
Epistle, betwixt St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Gospel, and
the Acts of the Apostles, not altogether
in the same hand, but in a Version some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
different from the present Vulgar
which shows, the Catholic Epistles have
been there, and that the Book was once
intire, bating only the <hi>Revelations,</hi> that
were not for some Ages, so universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
receiv'd in the Church.</p>
               <p>If I have brought the Age of this <hi>MS</hi>
too low, or lessen'd its Authority too
much, I shall be ready to alter my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
upon better Reasons, for I am not
much concern'd for the Reputation of a
Critic. I hope I shall always have a due
Concern for Religion and the Church,
and that my opinion should be true, I
think, is the interest of both: For this
Copy differing so much from all others,
the less Authority we give it, it will be
able to do the less hurt. I am sure they
have set it too high, who fetch it from
<hi>Irenaeus,</hi> or St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> both which Fathers
were Born before the <hi>Goths</hi> had Letters;
for that the Characters are <hi>Gothic,</hi> I
think I may be pretty positive. For this
Reason I shall never desire to see it Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
tho' a worthy Person seems to have
that Design and a Scheme has been mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:64296:114"/>
out to that purpose: But I hope that
Learned Body, in whose Custody it is,
will have more regard to the Will of
the Donor, whose first Intention, it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
was, that it should not<note n="k" place="margin">V. Bez. Epist. ad Acad. Can.</note> be
publish'd.</p>
               <p>Its various Readings have been given
us already in the <hi>Polyglott Bibles,</hi> tho' not
over accurately, and sufficient care ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
that it shall not, <hi>In uno exemplo peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clitari;</hi>
And what would the Critics have
more? Even Father <hi>Simon</hi> has procur'd
a Copy, from <hi>England,</hi> tho' I much su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
it is no other than those various
Readings: The Father tells us, <hi>Morinus</hi>
had it from <hi>Iunius</hi> the Library-keeper of
<hi>Cambridge,</hi> by such a mistake<note n="l" place="margin">Hist. N. T. Ch. 30.</note> as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Critic has given us a <hi>Magdeburgh</hi>
College at <hi>Oxford.</hi> But of this perhaps
too much.</p>
               <p>I will only offer one Criticism, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to wipe off a Blot from the <hi>English,</hi>
that has been unjustly cast upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
either by the Author, or Interpreter.
I have already said in another Chapter,
that <hi>Chalcocondylas</hi> does report of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi>

it is permitted the Stranger by way of

               <head type="sub">Of Oriental Learning, Jewish and
Arabian.</head>
               <p>IT has been an old Question, and much
debated amongst<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Learned Men,
whether greater Profit or Inconvenience
ariseth from reading the Jewish Books?
On the one hand it is alledg'd, that the
Hebrew Tongue, and Jewish Rites and
Customs, can be no way so well learnt,
as from themselves; and that as in order
to understand the Greek and Roman Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
it is necessary to read Greek and
Latin Authors: So if we would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Jewish affairs, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
learn them better, than from their
own Books. On the other side, they
have been charg'd with gross Ignorance,
even in their own affairs; and their Books
said to be so stuffed with Trifles, or, what
is worse, with poysonous Opinions, that
the profit in reading them will not
countervail the danger. Accordingly
they have met with a very different Fate;
At one time they have been order'd to be
read and studied, as by <hi>Clement</hi> the 5<hi>th,</hi>
                  <note n="m" place="margin">Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentin. l. 5. Tit. 1.</note>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:64296:115"/>
in the Council of <hi>Vienne:</hi> And again, the
<hi>Talmudic</hi> Books have been adjudg'd to be
burnt, as 12000 Volumes were by public
Order,<note n="n" place="margin">V. Sixt. Senens. l. 2. p. 120.</note> only out of one Library at
<hi>Cremona;</hi> And had not the Famous <hi>Reuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
advocated for them under the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
<hi>Maximilian,</hi> they had been in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of an Universal Ruine.</p>
               <p>In such variety there may be need of
distinction; And therefore the Jewish
Writers may be consider'd two ways,
either as Witnesses, or Interpreters: In
the first sense, they have been Faithful
Depositaries, and very useful in handing
down the Sacred Volumes, and in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the Text intire: In the other
sense, their Skill or Authority, as Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters,
has not been thought very consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.</p>
               <p>The great Reason whereupon their
Books have been valued, has been their
seeming Antiquity: In the last Age, we
have been told of Books as Old as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
and <hi>Ezra,</hi> that have had the fortune
to be believ'd by wisemen;<note n="o" place="margin">V. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin. l. 2. Exerc. 6. cap. 1. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erc. 9. cap. 8, &amp;c.</note> and
could their Rise be trac'd up and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from such an Original, they would
have reason to be valued: But this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor
has been taken off, and their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty
or Imposture has been detected:
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:64296:116"/>
                  <hi>Morinus</hi> has brought down most of
them several Centuries from their boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Height. Their <hi>Talmud</hi> that has been
commented upon by the Modern Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins,
has been shown to be little older
than the Age of <hi>Iustinian,</hi> the first Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic
mention we have of the <hi>Misna,</hi>
or Text of that Book (for the <hi>Gemara,</hi>
or Comment must have been yet later)
being in one of his Novels<note n="p" place="margin">Novel. 146.</note>, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably,
the Contention among the <hi>Iews</hi>
about receiving it, had given occasion to
that Law. <hi>Origen</hi> and St. <hi>Ierome</hi> knew
nothing of that Book; who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
were inquisitive Men, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Hebrew, and having had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
of consulting their Hebrew
Masters, and occasions of citing them, and
having done it in things of less moment,
could not have avoided mentioning this,
had it been then in being, and so noted,
as to be a standing Law Ecclesiastical and
Civil among the <hi>Iews</hi>
                  <note n="q" place="margin">Morin. ibid. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erc. 6.</note>. Their two
Books <hi>Bahir</hi> and <hi>Zohar,</hi> so venerable;
among them for their mighty Age, have
been brought down yet lower; tho
whatever Age they be of, they can be of
no use to any, being only a heap of Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balistical
Niceties<note n="r" place="margin">Buxtorf Bibl. Rab.</note>, which tho much
valu'd by such Men, as admire every
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:64296:116"/>
thing that is abstruse and hidden, are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
known to be nothing better than
Jargoon and Cant. The truth of it is, few
of their ancient Books have been thought
much better, being either so mystical, as
hardly to be understood, or so full of Gross
Legend, as to force them to take shelter
under Allegories to reconcile them to
sense. There is little Light to be bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd
from them, for almost a 1000 Years
after the last Destruction of their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and tho about that time, some of
the Modern Rabbins began to introduce
Learning, yet this was no part of their
Rabbinism, but a departing there-from;
most of the Learning they had was bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd
from the <hi>Arabians;</hi> and <hi>Maimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
Qui primus inter suos desiit nugari,</hi> by
mixing Philosophy and Reason with his
Comments, in order to make their Books
speak sense, thereby gave such offence,
that he was continually persecuted for it
by his Brethren,<note n="s" place="margin">Buxtorf Praef. in Mor. Ne. vocb.</note> and hardly escap'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
branded for à Heretick. They that have
taken the same way, ought upon their
Principles to fall under the like Censure;
and it ought always to be remembred,
that the modern Rabbins have done
best, whose Authority by their Age is
inconsiderable, and their Skill not so extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:64296:117"/>
as to need be imitated by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
who now understand their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
as well, and their Critical and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lological
Learning much better than they
do themselves. Even <hi>Maimonides</hi>
                  <note n="t" place="margin">Mor. Nevoch. Par. 1. cap. 67.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
of his times, that the <hi>Iews</hi> were
not then skilful in their own Language.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant with what design
some Men have decry'd the Rabbins;
whatever their design may have been,
they may have spoke truth, and at the
same time mistake their aim: We have
the less reason to be jealous of them,
since they are not the only Men that have
gone this way: For to pass by <hi>Luther,</hi>

Could any <hi>Iew</hi> have said more? Or could
it be imagin'd, a Christian would have
said so much? If these be the Fruits of
Rabbinical Enquiries, surely they were
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:64296:118"/>
better let alone. That a Man that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
in these sort of Studies should un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue
all other sorts of Learning, is no
new thing; it is what has been observ'd,
and for which a reason may be given: For
these Enquiries being out of the way,
and not every Man's possession, vulgar
Studies must be despis'd by Men of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common
Attainments, and those only va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
that are difficult and uncommon.
Or that others should imagine they find
Eloquence in the Rabbins, and should
compare <hi>Abravanel</hi> to <hi>Cicero,</hi> and <hi>Aben-Ezra</hi>
to <hi>Sallust</hi>
                  <note n="z" place="margin">Sim. Crit. Hist. l. 3. c. 7.</note>, is not very strange;
for Men are apt to find Beauty in Blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes,
where they have plac'd their Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:
But that Men should proceed to
Idolize them, no other Reason can be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd,
but that which is given for all Idols,
and that is, that they are all of them <hi>vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Because the Rabbins have been said to
have borrow'd most of their humane
Learning from the <hi>Arabians,</hi> I will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
speak one word of them. As the
<hi>Iews</hi> have borrow'd from the <hi>Arabians,</hi> so
have the <hi>Arabians</hi> from the <hi>Greeks;</hi> For
they were so far from having any Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their own, that the true <hi>Arabs,</hi> the
Descendants of <hi>Ismael,</hi> had no Letters;
and their Language must have been lost,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:64296:118"/>
had it not been preserv'd in their Poems,
that were compos'd by their Ancient
<hi>Bards</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Pocock ad Spec. Arab.</note>, and by their facility being
easily learnt, were deliver'd down from
hand to hand. Other Learning they had
very little, except Poetry, till having o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-run
the Eastern Parts of the <hi>Greek</hi>
Empire, they were taught it by the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish'd
People, who translated the <hi>Greek</hi>
Authors for them into their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
and the <hi>Arabians</hi> being Men of
quick Wits, refin'd so much upon their
Authors, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> became more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
in the <hi>Arabic,</hi> than he was before in
his own Tongue; and so much was he
admir'd in that Dress, that he was turn'd
from thence into Latin, with <hi>Averroes</hi>
upon him; and for some time, one was
not thought to understand <hi>Aristotle</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
unless he had read him with <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes</hi>'s
Comment. But this humor held
no longer than <hi>Averroes</hi> came to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
(understood I should not have
said; for perhaps no Man ever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
him, but till he came to be better
look't into,) for then his over-great Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cety
was not only d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>scover'd; but besides
other Errors, he was charged with the
Whimsies and Visions of the <hi>Alcoran</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Lud. Viv. de Caus. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt. Art. Lib. 5.</note>:
And <hi>Averroes</hi> is now as much out of fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

for his Philosophy, as <hi>Avicen</hi> is for his

               <p>Physic and Philosophy were the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
wherein the <hi>Arabians</hi> excell'd most,
and therefore the Books of that kind were
first translated and publish'd among us:
But since those Books have ceased to be
admir'd, an attempt has been made ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way, and we have been furnish'd
with a Sett of <hi>Arabic</hi> Historians, by <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penius,
Golius,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Pocock.</hi> Their
Books may be seen, and containing Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

of their performance: What sort of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian
<hi>Abulpharajius</hi> is, may be inferr'd
from his Learned Editor, who was under

his disagreement with <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi>
History. I am sure <hi>Eutychius</hi> is no better,
(whom Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> is pleas'd to style Our
<hi>Aegyptian Bede;</hi>) His History of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil

                  <hi>Constantine</hi> is describ'd as transferring his
Power upon the Bishops by the delivery
of his Ring, Sword, and Scepter; with
other things equally absurd: And that
the Canons might bear better proportion
to the number of Bishops; In the <hi>Arabic</hi>
Copies we have above a hundred,

are only twenty genuine Canons of that

               <p>We have been told oftner than once
of <hi>Livy</hi> compleat in <hi>Arabic,</hi> yet dormant
among their Manuscripts: But if their
Translations be no better than their Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories,
(and if we will take <hi>Huetius</hi>'s
<note n="e" place="margin">De Clar. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpr. p. 121.</note> account of them, they are rather
worse,) we have no reason to desire it
over-eagerly, tho it could be produc'd,
which I almost despair it ever shall.
Nor have we reason to be more fond of
their Geography, if we may make an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimate
from that taste thereof, which
has been given us, by <hi>Gabriel Sionita,</hi> in
the <hi>Nubian Geographer,</hi> who has relisht so
little with the World, as not to raise any
thirst or appetite of having more. With
what exactness he has describ'd the three
parts of the World, particularly <hi>Europe,</hi>
might be easily shown, were it worth
the while to trace him in his Failings:
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:64296:120"/>
He is to be seen, and every one that has
a Globe and Maps, can judge of the
Work.</p>
               <p>In one word, the great Use of the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi>
and <hi>Rabbinical</hi> Writers seems to
be, in confuting the <hi>Alcoran</hi> and <hi>Talmud;</hi>
and to that end, there is no doubt, they
may be effectually useful.</p>

               <p>DIvinity, as it is profess'd in the
Schools is become an Art, and
so profound a piece of Learning, that
it requires great Parts, and much Pains to
maister it; an argument sure, that it is
not so very necessary, otherwise it would
need less skill to be understood. I
would not detract from, much less de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
all use of this sort of Learning, tho'
if I should be free in my Censures, I
should have good authority to warrant
me therein; most of the first Reformers
having lead the way, and some of them
having declaim'd against it pretty warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Its great abuse in the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> had given too just occasion to this;
for that Church having adopted it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her Systems, and interwoven it with
most of her Opinions, and the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:64296:121"/>
having been the Great Champions
of her Cause, the Reformers were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
safe, till they had disarmed her of
this hold, which they did by exposing
this new method, and introducing in
its stead a much surer one, built upon
the clear Text of Scripture, and deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from thence, which they made use
of in all their Conferences and Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.
This, tho' the true and ancient
way, and most agreeable to the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of the Gospel, yet had been much
neglected by the Schoolmen, who having
broached new Opinions, were to support
them by new Methods, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
having been silent, or not speaking
home to their purpose, they therefore
us'd them very sparingly: The Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Fathers was call'd in, and
where these were deficient <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s
Philosophy was to supply the defect,
(without whom, if the observation in

Church had wanted some Articles
of Faith) the Fathers and Philosophical
reasons were their great strength. Tho'
after all it must be confest, that where
the Opinions of their Church have not
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:64296:121"/>
been concern'd, and where they have
argu'd barely upon the Principles of
Reason, they have often done exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well; only launching out beyond
their line they have as frequently mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry'd.</p>
               <p>The Faults in this sort of Learning
are chiefly these, (1.) Defectiveness for
want of proper helps. (2.) Incoherence.
(3) Nicety. (4.) Obscurity. (5.) Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity.
(1.) The Languages are one
proper help, for <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Philosophy,
and many of the Fathers being writ in
Greek, it was necessary in order to be
Master of these, that the Language
wherein they were writ should be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood:
This help the Schoolmen wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
having had no Greek and only a
very moderate share of Latin; <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
was known to them in a Tongue
that was none of his own, and being
obscure enough in himself, was much
more so, in wretched Translations; and
the Fathers, who were very Intelligible
in Greek, were either obscur'd, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
turn'd into another Idiom, or were
made to speak somewhat they never
meant. Both Greek and Latin Fathers
have been treated equally ill, for want
of another proper help, <hi>viz. Criticism,</hi>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:64296:122"/>
in distinguishing Genuine from Spurious
Authors; for want of which Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
have been crudely swallow'd down
without distinction; false Authorities
have been obtruded, and true ones re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
or often mutilated; the Ages of
Authors have been confounded, and
some late Imposter has assumed the
name of a venerable Father. Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
whereof (for I do not love to dwell
upon sores) may be had in <hi>Launoy</hi> in
several of his Epistles, and in <hi>Danae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>'s
Censure upon the first Book of
Sentences.</p>
               <p>(2.) By incoherence I do not mean
any inconsequence in the way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Divinity of the Schools, but a
disagreement of the parts, that it prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
consists of: which being chiefly
two (as we have before observ'd) the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of the Fathers and <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
what tolerable agreement can
there be betwixt two things so very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
most of the Fathers were <hi>Platonists</hi>
in their opinion, possibly for the sake
of some agreement, which that Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
seem'd to have with the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion: <hi>Origen,</hi> St <hi>Chrysostom,</hi>
and to name no more, St. <hi>Augustine</hi> who
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:64296:122"/>
was more followed in the Schools, than
all the rest, was of that number: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi>
was either much neglected by
the Fathers, or where they had occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to speak of him, they usually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
him; and that either for his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistic
way of reasoning, or for his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitable
Notions of God and Providence,
which are of first consideration in the
Schools. Even in the Church of <hi>Rome
Aristotle</hi> was often forbid, sometimes or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
to be burnt, and what is most
strange, at that time when his Books were
commented upon by <hi>Aquinas,</hi> they stood
prohibited by a Decree of <hi>Gregory</hi> the
IX,<note n="g" place="margin">V. Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy de var. Aristot. Fortuna cap. 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> Of late, almost in our time, a
proposal was made at <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Gregory</hi>
the XIV. that <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Philosophy
might be banished the Schools, and
<hi>Plato</hi>'s substituted in his place, as being
more agreeable to the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and Sence of the Fathers; and
above forty propositions were then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd,
wherein <hi>Plato</hi>'s Consonancy was
shown, in all which <hi>Aristotle</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended<note n="h" place="margin">Ibid. cap. 14.</note> to be Dissonant from the
true Religion: Whether upon just
grounds or no, I will not venture to
determine; for since Platonism has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
as it once did pretty early, and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:64296:123"/>
has again done of late, it has been found
liable to as dangerous consequences, as
any that have been yet charg'd upon
the other Philosophy. I only bring thus
much to show, that there can be no
good agreement in this particular,
where the Parts are of so different a
nature, as the Fathers and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and
so jarring, that they cannot naturally
cohere.</p>
               <p>(3.) Nicety is the great fault of the
Schools, her Doctors have been styl'd
<hi>Profound, Subtle, Irrefragable;</hi> Titles
which they have most valu'd themselves
upon, and seem not much to have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
the Reputation of being Familiar
and Easie, at least none of their Titles
have been derived from thence. They
delight in refining upon one another,
and sometimes spin so fine a thread,
that it is either broke, or much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in drawing it out: They have
perplex'd Knowledge, by starting insu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable
difficulties, and seem in this to
have run into the same fault with your too
profound Politicians, who, as they have
often foreseen designs, which are neither
practicable, nor ever intended; so these
men have propos'd Objections, that would
never have been thought of, had not they
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:64296:123"/>
first started them; the consequence
whereof has been, that we have furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
our Enemies with Objections, who
have made use of our Weapons, and
have turn'd our own Artillery against
us. This is too visible in our Modern
<hi>Socinians,</hi> who have often gather'd out
of this Store-house, and by picking up
difficulties in the Schoolmen, have turn'd
their Objections into Proof and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and have thereby gain'd the
Reputation of subtle Men. Thus Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
have been multiplied, and
those we have already, have swoln to
an unmeasurable height, and every dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
has become irreconcilable;
whilst Men study Nicety more than
Peace, and stretch their Wits, and rack
their Inventions, to out-reach their
Opponents. And it were well if the
mischief had stopt here, and Mens
Curiosity had not led them on, from
nice Questions to such as are Impious:
It has done this, and least I should be
thought to do them wrong, I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

in a more common Language</p>
               <p>(4.) <hi>Obscurity,</hi> where things are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
in themselves, if they be not so
clearly explain'd in treating of them, as
might be desir'd, the nature of the things
will excuse, as not being capable of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuity;
or if hard Terms are made
use of, if very significative, and not too
many, this is what is allowable in all
Arts; But then, if Terms of Art have
been multipli'd beyond necessity, and
without significancy; or if things that
are plain in themselves have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scur'd,
by being handled too Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
this sure is a great Abuse; and
this is, what has been charg'd upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Schoolmen. The mysteries
of Religion are not capable of being
rendred obvious to Reason, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if they have not made these plain,
they are not to be blam'd; they would
have been more excusable, had they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
them less, and had not trusted
too much to rational helps, in explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things, that are not the Objects of
our Understanding; but tho' Mysteries
are not to be explain'd, other things
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:64296:124"/>
in Religion are clear enough, and would
continue so, were they not clouded and
involv'd by too much Art. I do not
charge this as a general fault, tho' it be
too common; some of the Schoolmen
are less obnoxious to this charge, and
generally the first are least Obscure;
and <hi>Lombard</hi> and <hi>Aquinas,</hi> the two Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of the <hi>Sentences</hi> and <hi>Sums</hi> have been
more plain, than many of those that
have writ upon them, whose Comments
have often helpt to obscure the Text.
It is an odd Commendation that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

                  <note n="k" place="margin">De Subtil. l. 16.</note> to one of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen,

his own Books. Men that write <hi>De Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilitate,</hi>
must be allow'd to say what they
please, but those of ordinary Capacities
would have thought it a greater Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
that our Doctor had well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
that one Argument, and had

writ his Books, not without special in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of God Almighty, Chap. 1. That
in writing them, he receiv'd many things
by Revelation, Chap. 2. That all he
writ was without any Error, Chap. 4.
That Christ had given Testimony to
his Writings, Chap. 6. And to show of
how near the same Authority, St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>'s
<hi>Sum</hi> is to the Holy Scriptures, he
assures us, That as in the first General
Councils, it was usual to have the Holy
Bible laid open upon the Altar, as the
Rule of their proceedings; so in the last
General Council (which with them is
the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi>) St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s <hi>Sum</hi>
was plac'd with the Bible upon the same
Altar, as another Inferior Rule of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:64296:126"/>
Doctrine, Chap. 8. which is very
agreeable to what has been writ by a
Jesuit<note n="n" place="margin">Tauner. Quaest. 1. Dub. 2.</note> upon the same Subject, That
all the General Councils, that have been
held since St. <hi>Thomas</hi> liv'd, have taken
the opinions they defin'd from his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
It were needless after this to
cite the Elogy of another Jesuit<note n="o" place="margin">Petr. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

where St. <hi>Thomas</hi> is styl'd an Angel, and
that as he learnt many things from the
Angels, so he taught Angels some things;
That St. <hi>Thomas</hi> had said, what St. <hi>Paul</hi>
was not suffer'd to utter; That he speaks
of God as if he had seen him, and of
Christ, as if he had been his voice, and
more to this effect.</p>
               <p>When such bold expressions are open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

and it concerns every Man to endeavour
to give a check to such daring asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
I am far from detracting either
from the Knowledge or Holiness of
St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> which doubtless were both
extraordinary, but when a Mortal Man,
is equall'd to the Angels in Heaven, and
such Elogies given him, as if he were
capable of hearing, he must blush to
receive; it is justice to him, to rescue
him from false and undue Praises. To
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:64296:126"/>
do him Right, he has improv'd natural
Reason to an uncommon height, and
many of those proofs of a God and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
and Natural Religion, that have
been advanced of late, as new Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with so much applause, have been
borrow'd from him or other School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
and are only not his, by being
put in a new Dress, and sometimes in
a worse method. Had it been his fortune
to have lived in a happier Age, under
better opportunities, and with those helps
that we now enjoy, he must have made a
greater <hi>Genius,</hi> than many of those, who
are now look'd upon with wonder.</p>

               <head type="sub">Conclusion.</head>
               <p>AND now having gone through
the several sorts of Learning, and
observ'd the various defects, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
uncertainties, which they are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to; The Conclusion is obvious, That
since no compleat satisfaction is to be
met with from them, we are to seek
for it somewhere else, if happily it may
be found. It may be found, but not
in our own powers, or by our own
strength; and that which our most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
Reason, under all its improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
cannot yield us, is only to be
had from Revelation. It is there we
may securely rest, after the Mind has
try'd all other ways and methods of
Knowledge, and has tir'd it self with
fruitless Enquiries. It is with the Mind,
as with the Will and Appetites; for as
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:64296:127"/>
after we have try'd a thousand Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
and turn'd from one Enjoyment
to another, we find no rest to our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
till we at last fix them upon the
Soveraign Good: So in pursuit of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
we meet with no tolerable sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to our Minds, till after we
are wearied with tracing other methods,
we turn them at last upon the one su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
and unerring truth. And were
there no other use of humane Learning,
there is at least this in it, That by its
many defects, it brings the Mind to a
sense of its own weakness, and makes
it more readily, and with greater wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness,
submit to Revelation. God
may have so order'd in his Wise Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
thereby to keep us in a constant
dependance upon himself, and under a
necessity of consulting him in his Word
which since Profane Men treat so neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectfully
already, they would have it in
greater Contempt; and it would be
much more vile in their Eyes, did they
find any thing within them equally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
which might guide them in their
Course, and bring them to the Haven,
where they would be. But this since
they do not meet with, it ought to
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:64296:128"/>
wean them from an opinion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and incline them to seek out sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
somewhere else, and to take
shelter where it may be found.</p>
               <p>I have said nothing in this whole Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
(nor can I repeat it too often)
with design to discredit humane Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
I am neither of their mind<note n="p" place="margin">Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists in <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  </note> who
were for burning all Books, except their
Bibles; nor of that Learned Man's opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
who thought the Principles of all
Arts and Sciences might be borrow'd
from that Store-house: I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
put a just Value upon the one,
without depressing the other: But where
Men lash out the other way, and take
the liberty to exalt Learning to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of Religion, and to oppose shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Reason to Revelation, it is then
time, and every Man's business, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to keep it under, at least to
prevent its aspiring, by not suffering it
to pass its due Bounds. Our Reason is
a proper Guide in our Enquiries, and is
to be follow'd, where it keeps within
its Sphere; but shining dimly, it must
borrow Rays from the Fountain of
Light, and must always act subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
to Revelation. Whenever it cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:64296:128"/>
that, it is out of its Sphere, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
contradicts its own Light; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more reasonable, than to believe
a Revelation, as being grounded upon
God's Veracity, without which even
Reason it self will be often doubting.
That whatever God (who is Truth it
self) reveals, is true: is as sure and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
a Proposition, as any we can think
of: It is certain in its Ground, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in its Connexion, and needs no
long Consequences to make it out;
whereas most of our rational deductions
are often both weakly bottom'd, and
depending upon a long train of Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
which are to be spun from one
another, their strength is often lost, and
the thread broken, before we come at
the Conclusion.</p>
               <p>And tho' it be commonly objected,
that there are as many differences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Divine Truths, as about those
of Nature: yet I think there needs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
further be said to this, but that
Men would approach Divine Truths
with the same dispositions, that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
by Philosophers to the reading
of their Writings, and the Objection
would soon fall to the ground: The
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:64296:129"/>
best Philosophers require, that in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Books, we should lay aside
partiality to a Party, all passion and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
prejudice; and let Men only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
the Scriptures with the same
preparations of Mind, and with these
and ordinary Grace (that is never want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to those that seek it) I dare be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
they will have no reason to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of Obscurity or Ambiguity in those
Sacred Writings: With these Helps (that
are had by asking) the weakest and
most ordinary Capacity shall see enough,
and shall not stand in need of deep Reach
or Penetration, which are necessary to
the understanding of Natural Truths.
God, who would have all Men happy,
has likewise made them all so far wise,
and has so order'd, that the most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Truths, should be the most easie and
common; and if it can be no objection,
that to the understanding of them, we
must make use of ordinary means, and
must come prepar'd with suitable dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions:
This is what is necessary in all
other things; for every thing is best
understood by the same Spirit by which
it is writ.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:64296:129"/>God has gone yet farther with us; Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Truths are not only the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
but he has likewise made them the
most convincing, and has given them a
power, that is not easily resisted: Rational
Arguments, however, convincing they
may seem, are usually repell'd by Reason,
and it is hard to convince a Man by such
methods, that is equally Master of Reason
with our selves; whereas Divine Truths
make their own way, they act upon us
with a secret Power, and Press the mind
with an almost irresistible Strength, and do
not only perswade, but almost force an
assent: The first only act like Light,
the other strike down and pierce us
through like Lightning. We have as
remarkable a passage to this purpose<note n="q" place="margin">Sozo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

as most in Ecclesiastical Story; which
tho' well attested, yet were it only a
Parable, the Moral of it might be of
good use. Upon the Convening of the
first General Council at <hi>Nice,</hi> and the
appearing of the Christian Bishops there,
several of the Heathen Philosophers of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
themselves among the Sons of God,
intending to signalize themselves upon
so great an occasion, by attacking the Faith
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:64296:130"/>
in its most Eminent Professors, and by
endeavouring to overthrow it by Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
and Reason. To this End se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Conferences were held upon the
Principles of Reason, by the most noted
Men of either Party, in which one of
the Philosophers more forward than the
rest, begun to grow Insolent upon a
suppos'd advantage, and must needs
Triumph before Victory: An aged Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
took fire at this, one who had been
a Confessor in the late Persecution, and
was more noted for his Faith than Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
Philosophy he had none, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters
his Adversary in a new manner,
in the name of Jesus, and by the word of
God, and with a few plain Weapons
drawn from thence, he humbles the
Pride of this arrogant Philosopher, and
straitway leads him Captive to the Font;
All the Reply our Philosopher had left
him, was, that while he was encountred
by Philosophy and humane Learning,
he defended himself the same way, but
being attack'd by higher Reasons, it
was necessary for him to yield himself
up to the power of God. Such is the
Force of that Word, which simple vain
Men so much contemn!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:64296:130"/>What then must we do? Are we to
give our selves up to this Word, and
lay aside all humane Learning? I am
far from thinking so, and have already
caution'd against any such Wild and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptistical
Conceit; these two may
well consist, Learning is of good use in
explaining this Word, and the Word
serves very well to lessen our opinion of
humane Learning; the former may be
serviceable, whilst it acts ministerially
and in subservience to the latter, but
being only a Hand-maid to Religion,
whenever it usurps upon that, it is to
be kept down, and taught its Duty; it
is still only humane Learning, that is,
very weak and very defective, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all the great things that can he said
of it, and the uses that may be assigned
it, it must after all be confess'd, that
our Bible is our best Book, and the only
Book that can afford any true and solid
satisfaction. It is that which satisfies
and never satiates, which the deeper it
is look'd into, pleaseth the more, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
new and hid Treasures, by the
opening whereof, there always springs
up in the mind fresh pleasure and new
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:64296:131"/>
desire. Whereas Humane Writings (like
all humane things) cloy by their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance,
and we can scarce read them
the second time without irksomeness,
and oftentimes not without nauseating
those fine things, that please so wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
at the first reading.</p>
               <p>The Sum of all is this, we busie our
selves in the search of Knowledge, we
tire out our Thoughts, and wast our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
in this pursuit, and afterwards flatter
our selves with mighty Acquirements,
and fill the World with Volumes of our
Discoveries: Whereas would we take as
much pains in discovering our Weakness
and Defects, as we spend time in Often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of our Knowledge, we might
with half the time and pains, see enough
to show us our Ignorance, and might
thereby learn truer Wisdom. We frame
to our selves New Theories of the World,
and pretend to measure the Heavens by
our<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mathematical Skill (that is, Indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Space by a Compass, or Span)
whilst we know little of the Earth we
tread on, and every thing puzzles us,
that we meet with there: We live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Earth, and most Men think they
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:64296:131"/>
rest upon it, and yet it is a very difficult
Question in Philosophy, whether the
Earth rests or moves; and is it not very
wonderful, that we should be such
strangers to the place of our Abode, as
to know nothing, whether we rest
there, or travel a daily Circuit of some
thousand Miles? We rack our Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to find out Natural Reasons for a
Deluge of Waters, by fetching down Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
from above, and cracking the <hi>Cortex</hi>
of the Earth, to furnish out sufficient
stores for that purpose; and yet from
the <hi>Convexity</hi> of the Waters, it is hard
to account in the Course of Nature, why
there should not bea Deluge every day:
And perhaps Providence is the surest
Bar, that has set Bounds to the Waters,
which they shall not pass. We are not
only puzzled by things without us, but
we are strangers to our own Make and
Frame, for tho' we are convinced, that
we consist of Soul and Body: yet no
Man hitherto has sufficiently described
the Union of these two, or has been able
to explain, how Thought should move
Matter? Or how Matter should act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Thought? Nay the most Minute
things in Nature, if duly considered,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:64296:132"/>
carry with them the greatest wonder,
and perplex us as much, as things of
greater bulk and show. And yet we,
who know so little in the smallest mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
talk of nothing less than New <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the World</hi> and <hi>vast Fields of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
busying our selves in Natural
Enquiries, and flattering our selves
with the wonderful Discoveries and
mighty Improvements that have been
made in Humane Learning, a great
part of which are purely imaginary,
and at the same time neglecting the only
true and solid and satisfactory Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
Things that are obscure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
we pursue with eagerness, whilst
Divine Truths are usually disregarded,
only because they are easie and common:
Or if there be some of an higher nature,
they shall possibly be rejected, because
they are above or seemingly contrary
to Reason, whilst we admit several other
things without scruple, which are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil
able with Revelation; tho Revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Truths be certainly Divine, and the
other, either no Truths at all, or at the
best, only Humane. This sort of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
is very preposterous, for, after all,
true Wisdom and satisfactory Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:64296:132"/>
is only to be had from Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and as to other Truths, which are to
be collected from Sense and Reason, our
Ignorance of them will always be so much
greater than our Knowledge, as there
are a thousand things we are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of, to one thing that we throughly
