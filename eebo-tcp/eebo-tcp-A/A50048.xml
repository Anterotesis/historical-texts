            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>So in the History of <hi>Augustus, Suetonius</hi> saith, <hi>Quasi alii se puerum, alii ornandum tollendumque jactassent; ne aut sibi aut ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teranis par gratia referretur.</hi> The grace lieth in the ambiguity of the Latine word <hi>tollendum,</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:102413:75"/>
which in one signification, is in a manner equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent with <hi>laudandum &amp; ornandum,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokeneth to be <hi>advanced, extolled,</hi> or <hi>lifted up,</hi> and so it is to be taken in good part; but in another, it is all one with <hi>tollendum de me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio</hi> or <hi>occidendum,</hi> that is, to be <hi>dispatched out of life</hi> or <hi>killed,</hi> in which sence <hi>Augustus</hi> took it; much like to that you shall read of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> in <hi>Martial,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The like appeareth in some of <hi>Augustus</hi> his witty speeches, as that to <hi>Galba; Ego te mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere possum, corrigere non possum.

               <hi>Nero</hi> said jestingly of <hi>Claudius,</hi> That he left <hi>morari inter homines;</hi> in which Verb <hi>morari</hi> there is couched a double sense, which gives the grace unto this pleasant scoff; for being a

meer Latine word, and having the first sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by nature short, it signifieth to stay, or to make long abode, and taking it thus, <hi>Nero</hi> might be thought to imply thus much; that <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> was now departed out of the company of mortal men: but take the same word as <hi>Nero</hi> spake it, derived of <gap reason="foreign">

In the time of the two first <hi>Caesars,</hi> which had the Art of Government in greatest perfection, there lived the best Poet, <hi>Virgilius Maro;</hi> the best Historiographer, <hi>Titus Livius;</hi> the best Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary, <hi>Marcus Varro;</hi> and the best or second Orator, <hi>Marcus Cicero,</hi> that to the memory of man are known. The time that the Roman Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy seemed to be at his <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Afterward, many filthy Monsters reigned, and many seditions and civil wars followed; therefore I have not only enlarged the former Treatise, by inserting here and there some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther special observations, but have made an addition also of six more Emperors since, (as Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> also saith in his advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Learning) the six next Princes were all learned, or singular favourers and advancers
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:102413:76"/>
of Learning: which age (as he also saith) for temporal respects, was the most happy and flourishing that ever the Roman Empire (which then was a Model of the world) enjoyed: a matter revealed and prefigured unto <hi>Domitian</hi> in a dream, the night before he was slain; for he thought there was grown behind upon his shoulders a neck and a head of Gold, which came accordingly to pass, in those golden times which succeeded. <hi>Fulk</hi> in his Book of Meteors observeth, not long before the contention of <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba, Otho</hi> and <hi>Vitellius,</hi> for the Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> there appeared three Suns, as it were pointing out the strife which followed soon after between them three for the Imperial Diadem; of threescore and thirteen Roman Emperors (that perished within the narrow compass of one hundred years) only three died a natural death in their Beds, the rest were cut off by their lusts.</p>
            <p>It was a heavy time then with Christians, when they groned under the Persecuting Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors three hundred years together, yet in that time they had many <hi>Lucida intervalla,</hi> many breathing spaces under Princes not altogether so bloody: there were two principal Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Church, <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> and <hi>Julian,</hi> but the last was the most pestilent. <hi>Jerome</hi> justly styled him <hi>Canem rabidum;</hi> and it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:102413:77"/>
what is observed of him, that going forth to the Persian War, he asked in scoffing manner, What the Carpenters Son (meaning Christ) was doing? To whom it was answered by a good Christian, <hi>Loculum fabricatur,</hi> He is making a Coffin for <hi>Julian;</hi> which Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical speech was indeed verified by the event; for <hi>Julian</hi> was strangely wounded and slain in that War, and as in his life time he had blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed Christ, so he died blaspheming Christ, and casting up his blood towards Heaven, he cried, <hi>Vicisti o Galilaee,</hi> Thou hast overcome O Galilean.</p>
            <p>This may suffice to have spoken of some of the chief Persecutors in general, since I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose not to enlarge this Treatise any more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is little said of many of the Roman Emperors, and the <note n="*" rend="inter">Mexia <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated by</hi> Grimston.</note> History of them altogether is already written in our Mother tongue: but I intended only at the first, <hi>Analecta,</hi> some choice and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy observations of them, if these therefore may benefit thee, <hi>summam votorum attigi,</hi> I have attained the end of my desires, and so I rest</p>

            <p>He was at first harsh, after favourable to Christians, thought to build a Temple to Christ, but was diverted by <hi>Vlpian</hi> and others, who having consulted their Heathen gods, received this answer (saith <hi>Lampridius</hi> c. 43.) that if that were suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all men would be Christians, and all other Temples desolate.</p>

            <p>When he appointed Governors of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, he published their names, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and encouraging the people to bring in what exception they could against them, and manifestly to prove the crime, if there was cause of accusation; provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:102413:136"/>
if they did not sufficiently prove their charge, and that their accusation proceeded from malice, the accuser should forthwith be beheaded: for, said he, <hi>Since Christians and Iews use this method in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Priests, it is most reasonable that the like course should be taken in the choice of Rectors of Provinces, to whom are committed the lives and fortunes of those who are under them.</hi> Id. ib. c. 49.</p>
            <p>When certain Hucksters and Cooks pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended they had right to a place which was consecrated by the Christians, and it was enquired what was his pleasure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, he answered; <hi>It was better that God should be worshipped there after any sort, than that the places should be put to vain uses.</hi> Id. ib. c. 49.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eusebius</hi> in his Ecclesiastical History l. 6. saith, that there were many Christians in his family.</p>
            <p>He freely sent of his Treasure to many poor men for the purchasing of lands, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his money from the rents thereof. <hi>Lampridius</hi> in <hi>Alex. Sev.</hi> c. 21.</p>
            <p>To many Cities which were defaced by Earthquakes, he remitted the tribute for their reparation. <hi>Id.</hi> c. 44.</p>
            <p>He wrote down so far as he could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what he had given to any man, and if he found any to whom he had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther given nothing, or that which was not equal to his merit, he called them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, saying; <hi>What is the cause thou askest
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:102413:136"/>
nothing of me</hi>?<note place="margin">It was more troublesome to him (saith one) to be asked no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, than to give much.</note> 
               <hi>Wouldst thou have me be in thy debt? Ask something that thou mayest not complain of me for want of promotion.</hi> He gave such things as impaired not his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; <hi>viz.</hi> goods of men attainted, not being in gold, silver or jewels: for that was put in the common treasury. <hi>Lampri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> in <hi>Alex. Sev.</hi> c. 46.</p>
            <p>When any one had exercised his office in the Common-wealth well, at the end of his term when there was a Successor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, he would say to him who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of his office; <hi>Gratias tibi agit Respublica:</hi> and would so reward him, that being a private person, he might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his degree live in good fashion. His reward was in land, cattel, horses, grain, iron, stone, and other things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for Edifices. <hi>Id. Ibid.</hi> c. 32.</p>
            <p>He allowed every Judge of a Province 20 pound weight in silver, 6 silver pots, 2 Mules, 2 Mulets, 2 Horses, a Horse-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and a Muletor, 2 Robes to sit in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, one honourable garment to wear in his house, one for his bath, one Cook, and 100 crowns; their employment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended, they were bound to restore the Mules, Mulets, Horses, Muletors and Cooks: but might retain the residue if they had discharged their office well, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise they payed 4 times as much as they received. <hi>Id. Ib.</hi> c. 42.</p>
            <p>He thought the safety of the State de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon the Soldiers. <hi>Lampridius</hi> in <hi>Alex. Severo,</hi> c. 47.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:102413:137"/>He gave such lands as he won out of the Enemies hands to his Lords Marchers, and his Soldiers, that they should be theirs, and their heirs for ever, so they would be Soldiers, neither should they at any time come to the hands of private men, saying <q>They would more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully serve, if they fought for their own lands.</q> 
               <hi>Lampridius</hi> in <hi>Alexandro Severo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He did let no day pass without exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing himself in learning and martial af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. <hi>Id. Ib.</hi> c. 3.</p>
            <p>After publick affairs whether martial or civil, he employed himself most about the reading of Greek Authors, as <hi>Plato de republica.</hi> And when he would read a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Latine books, he chiefly made use of <hi>Tully</hi> his <hi>Offices,</hi> and his tract <hi>De republica,</hi> not now extant. Sometime he read Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Poets, among whom was <hi>Serenus Sammonicus</hi> (whom he knew and favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) and also <hi>Horace. Lampridius</hi> in <hi>Alex. Sev.</hi> c. 30.</p>
            <p>
               <q>When he dined or supped abroad, he had ever with him <hi>Vlpian</hi> or other learned men,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>He delighted not so much in Latine eloquence, as in the Greek, in which he made elegant verses; inclined to Musick, was learned in the Mathematicks; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

            <p>He never had any scenical sports at a feast, but delighted much in making whelps to play with young pigs, in the fighting of Partridges, and in little birds flying up and down. To lighten his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick cares, he had Aviaries of Peacocks, Pheasants, Ducks, Partridges, and Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doves; which he so extreamly liked, that he had about 20000 of them: for the feeding whereof his servants provided by sale of their Eggs and young ones. <hi>Lampridius</hi> in <hi>Alex. Sev.</hi> c. 41.</p>
            <p>Every day also he did some good to others, in which (saith <hi>Tristan)</hi> he had an advantage of happiness above <hi>Titus,</hi> who could not express the like goodness above the space of a years in which he reigned.</p>

            <p>If necessity required, he heard matters before day, staying till it was late; never seeming to be weary or troubled: but had all the time the same countenance, in all things appearing merry and pleasant. <hi>Lampridius,</hi> c. 29.</p>
            <p>He was so courteous that he visited the meanest of his sick friends, desiring them to tell him their minds freely of every thing, and hearing them attentively; and when he had heard them throughly, whatsoever he found amiss he carefully amended: and when his Mother <hi>Mammaea</hi> and his Wife <hi>Memmia</hi> blamed him for his great civility, saying it made his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity contemptible, he answered; <q>But more secure and durable.</q>

               <hi>Sept.

Three daies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Emperor riding to view his Camp, saw <hi>Maximinus</hi> (who was yet but a fresh water-soldier) out of order; wherefore
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:102413:141"/>
he commanded a Colonel to call him into his rank, and to instruct him in the duty he was to observe in the Wars: <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> imagining the Emperor spake of him, kneeled down at his feet. The Emperor desiring to see whether he could run well or no, spurred his horse and took several turns in the field; and seeing <hi>Maximinus</hi> left not off running, old <hi>Severus</hi> being tired said to <hi>Maximinus,</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Thracian,</hi> will you wrestle after your race?</q> whereto he answered, <q>So long as it shall please your Majesty.</q> Then the Emperor chusing 7 of the strongest men in his army, <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> overcame them without resting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween. Whereupon <hi>Severus</hi> commanded a collar of gold to be given to him alone, with certain pieces of silver; made him one of his guard, and commanded that he should continually attend in the Palace: by which means he came to be esteemed by the Commanders and Soldiers, and to obtain what he desired of the Emperor. <hi>Id.

            <p>He was diligent as well after, as before his preferment, saying; <hi>Ego quo major fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ero, tanto plus laborabo</hi>: and rather than his Soldiers should be out of action, he employed them in hunting.</p>
            <p>Even in his old age he would throw down 5, 6, or 7 Soldiers (whom he wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with) one after another; and being challenged by a Tribune who envied him, when they met, <hi>Maximinus</hi> gave him such
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:102413:142"/>
a blow on the brest with the palm of his hand, that he threw him flat upon his back, saying in sport; <hi>Date alium sed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunum.</hi> Id. ib. c. 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caracallo</hi> made <hi>Maximinus</hi> a Centurion; (in <hi>Macrinus</hi> his reign he left the army out of hatred to the assasinate of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign;) even <hi>Helagabalus</hi> permitted him to be a Tribune: but <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> gave him the command of a Legion, whose death notwithstanding he disloyally pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised (as is before mentioned;) whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he was elected Emperor by the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, without the consent of the Senate. <hi>Id. ibid.</hi> c. 4, 5, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>It appeareth unquestionably that he committed this villany (notwithstanding the doubts of some) because he killed all <hi>Alexanders</hi> relations and friends. <hi>Tristan.</hi>

            <p>He was so feared at <hi>Rome,</hi> that when he was in <hi>Italy,</hi> the women with their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren prayed solemnly in their Temples that he might never return; having heard that some were crucified by him, some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed in beasts newly killed, others cast to wild beasts, others bruised with clubs, without any regard to the quality of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. <hi>Id. ibid.</hi> c. 8.</p>

            <p>He was so infatuated with the confidence of his own greatness &amp; personal strength,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:102413:143"/>
that he entertained a conceit, that death durst not adventure to encounter him, for fear of having his Javelin broke about his own crazy skull, and all his <hi>Skeleton</hi> of bones rattled to dust. Dr. <hi>Charleton</hi>'s Darkness of Atheism dispelled by the light of nature, p. 178.</p>
            <p>Because he thought himself immortal, he was covertly defied in the <hi>Theatre</hi> by a <hi>Comoedian</hi> in these verses:

<pb n="397" facs="tcp:102413:208"/>
out of doubt an addition thrust in by some, who finding that calumny against <hi>Constantine,</hi> set down in <hi>Zosimus</hi> (as it is most maliciously,) thought good to insert it also into the latine Chronicle of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi>; whereas neither is it in the Greek, nor is it true that <hi>Constantine</hi> brake his oath or promise therein with <hi>Licinius</hi>: for his promise of life was conditional, as <hi>Socrates</hi> expresly sheweth, and <hi>Licinius</hi> quickly violated the condition by attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a new rebellion. And <hi>Eusebius</hi> in his other books is so far from imputing any blame or blemish to <hi>Constantine</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that action, that he expresly saith, <hi>Licinius</hi> suffered just and deserved punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which had it been effected by the perjury of <hi>Constantine</hi> had certainly been unjust. <hi>Crakanthorp</hi>'s Defence of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> p. 29, 30.</p>
