         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>KYng Dauid saith the lord fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him: wherfore he can lack nothing to liue a vertuous and Godlye lyfe. In this first parte some thynges are to be consydered. First of God that feedeth, and nexte of man that is fedde. God that fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Dauid calleth by the name of a shepeheard, and his people he calleth by the name of sheepe. By this name of a shephearde the prophete openeth and disclosethe the nature of God to all his miserable and lost creatures, that he is contente not onely to wish and desire manne that is loste, to be founde and restored agayne, but also doth seke and trauayle to restore and bringe hym home agayne: As it is written in Esay the porphet,<note place="margin">Esa. 40.</note> he shall
<pb facs="tcp:13397:9"/>
gather togeyther hys lambes in hys arme. And in Ezechiell the prophet the lord sayth,<note place="margin">Ezech. 44.</note> behold I wyl requyre my flocke of the sheepeheardes. &amp;c. And I wyll delyuer my slocke frome theyr mouthe, and they shall be no more their meate, for thus sayth the Lorde: beholde I wyll searche oute my sheepe, and wyll vysit them as a shepehearde doeth visite hys sheepe, when he is in the myddes of his scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered sheepe, so wyll I visit my shepe and delyuer them frome all places where as they haue bene scattered. &amp;c And Ieremy the prophet in the same sorte declareth the nature of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the loste flocke,<note place="margin">Iere. 31.</note> saying: he that despersed Israel shall gather him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether agayne and keepe him as the shepehearde kepeth his flocke. Christ our sauiour nameth him selfe a good shepehearde, and sayeth that he was sent to call such as were not sheepe of the vtt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When he is assured of Gods merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full nature that seketh the lost shepe, he openeth farther the nature of god, what he will do w<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the shepe, which he findeth: feade hym sayth the prophet Dauid, and putteth him selfe for an exsample. Here is the mercye of the great sheepehearde farther declared, that he killeth not his shepe, robbe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h them not, but seedeth and nourisheth them. Of this speaketh the prophet Ezechiell in the parson of almightye God:<note place="margin">Ezech. 34.</note> I my selfe wyll feede my shepe and make that they shall rest quietly, saieth the Lorde God. That whiche is lost I wil seeke, such as go astray I wyl bringe agayn, such as be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded I wyl binde vp, such as be weake I wil make strong, but such as be fat &amp; strong those wil I roote out, &amp; I wil feede my shepe in reason &amp; iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And the great shepeherd Christ saith,<note place="margin">Ioh. 10.</note> whether his shepe go in or oute they shal finde pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:13397:10"/>
onelye to seeke the loste shepe, but al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>so when he hath founde him to feede him, then he addeth in his hymne, after what sorte hee feedethe hym: So that I shall lacke nothinge, saith the prophete. Heare is the declaring of the greate shepeheardes pasture, wherewith he feedethe the flocke of his pasture. Christe expresseth the same wonderfullye in the openinge of hys offyce and doctryne vntoo the worlde in Sayncte Iohn sayinge: I came that they mighte haue lyfe and haue it moste aboundauntelye.<note place="margin">Ioa. 10.4.6</note> And talkinge with the poore woman of Samaria <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As theese properties be in God the shepeherd, (as the prophet hath marked) euen in the lyke sorte be the contrarye condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions in man the sheepe he speakethe of. For as the nature of God is too seeke, so is the nature of man to go a straye, As the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This goinge a stray and seeding vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on euyll pasture,<note place="margin">2. Thes., 2.</note> is wonderfully set foorthe by Sainte Paule: for when men wyll not feede vppon the truth, it is Goddes iuste iudgemente they shoulde feede vppon falsehode. And as Goddes nature is not onelye too feede but fullye to satisfye and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenyshe wyth all goodnesse, so that nothynge maye lacke for a Godlye and vertuous life:<note place="margin">Ioa. 4.6.</note> In lyke manner the nature of manne is not onelye to feede but also to replenyshe it selfe with al infected and contagious doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> vntyll suche time that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise and contemne God and all hys holesome lawes.

Thus in the fyrst part of this celestiall hymne is the nature of God and manne described vnder the name of a shepehearde and of sheepe.</p>
            <p>Of this parte of the psalme what the prophet hath sayed of God and of man,<note place="margin">What is to benoted out of this part of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> psalme</note> we must for our owne doctrine and learninge gather some things to be the better by.<note place="margin">Rom. 15.</note> For Sayncte Paul sayeth, what so euer is wrytten, is written for oure learninge.
