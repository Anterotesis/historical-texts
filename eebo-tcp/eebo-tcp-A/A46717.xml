            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Publisher to the Reader.</head>
            <p>TO commend this Argument I'll not undertake, because
of the Author; but yet I may tell you what is told me,
That it is worthy any Gentleman's perusal, for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
is of concern to the Publick in general, and to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
individual Man in the Kingdom either immediately or by Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
since Trade is the Life of a Nation, and all Men are Traders
either by themselves or others; the Consequences of it are Strength,
Wealth, and Employment to all sorts of People whatsoever: And that,
and nothing but that, can secure the Peace of the Country, it employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both Rich and Poor, and keeping all from Idleness, and so prevents
Ill Men from disturbing the Government by Treasons, or the Subject
by Felonies, both which are most frequent when Trade is dull, and
Men are Idle; when the Exchange is thin, and Shops are empty.</p>
            <p>'Twould be an endless Task to recount the Desolations and Ruins
that have happened to States and Kingdoms by Sloth, Luxury, Idleness,
and the neglect of Commerce, and the prodigious Benefits that have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crued
to several Countries by the contrary, and to our own in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
and the vigilant Care and Zeal, which wise Kings, Princes, and
other Sovereign Potentates, have always had and used for the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and Promotion of Traffick, within their respective Territories.</p>
            <p>That Foreign Trade is of absolute necessity, and infinite advantage
to <hi>England,</hi> is as apparent as that we are an <hi>Island</hi> peculiarly ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted,
and prepared for it by Nature her self; insomuch that Shipping,
which at first was an Invention of the <hi>Deity,</hi> for the Use of <hi>Noah</hi>
and his Family, seems a Blessing design'd, most particularly for us, to
render us sociable with the Inhabitants of Foreign Countries, that we
might borrow of their Necessities, and vent our own Superfluities
to them instead ou't; and so maintain a Correspondence with all the
habitable World.</p>
            <p>That Foreign Commerce cannot be advantagiously maintained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Societies instituted for that purpose, is sufficiently manifested to
all considerate Men, from the Policies of other Laws abroad, which
establish them, and from the Provisions of our own, which allow and
protect them, and from the necessity of the thing it self, as appears by
the vast Charge, (in Intelligence, Factors, Castles, Forts, Men, Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)


<pb facs="tcp:55333:3"/>
and the wise Conduct requisite for the support of such a Commerce,
which without the united Aid of a considerable number of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Merchants, upon a considerable Stock; must necessarily be obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the growing Incroachments of neighbouring Countries, (which
use the Policy of setled Companies) and to the other mischievous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualties,
that may daily happen through the Indiscretion and Rashness,
and other weakness in Stock or Conduct of particular individual Persons,
exercising such Traffick.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>East-India</hi> Company, they support the Crown by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
Customs, which are yearly paid by it; they bear a considerable
Proportion of publick and necessary Subsidies; they enrich the Nation
by their Importations; they Convert <hi>Infidels,</hi> or at least civilize them,
and make them more humane by their Correspondencies; they employ
vast numbers of Poor People; they negotiate vast Sums of private
Persons Monies, which would otherwise lie dead or useless: They edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
and breed vast numbers of Sea men for the Services of War;
they build and employ Vessels of great Burden, useful to the Crown
and Publick upon emergent Occasions: Their Naval Force is part of
the Defence of the Kingdom; their Trading Fleet, is both the
Glory and Riches of the Nation; they have improved and do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Spirit of Commerce to that degree, as preserves the Balance
of Trade between us and our Neighbours in its just Proportions;
which Company, were it dissolved, their Trade and Strength would
increase, and ours decay, and we should be reduced to our Primitive
State of Self-subsistance, and our Merchants, (now the Pride of
<hi>England,</hi> and the Envy of the World) must become Domestick Ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
for an home ignoble Traffick from Cities to Towns, and from
Towns to Villes, <hi>&amp; sic retrorsum:</hi> For these Reasons is the ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Argument published.</p>

                        <p>I. DEfendant demands <hi>Oyer</hi> of the Letters Patents which are
set forth <hi>in haec verba.</hi> In which (as it hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served)
the penalty of Forfeiture of Ship and Goods,
one moiety to the King, and the other to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and Imprisonment is omitted.</p>
                        <p>II. There is also a Clause, that the Company may License Strangers
or others, and that the King will not without the consent of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
give Licences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>III. That none shall have a Vote in the General Assembly but he
that hath 500 <hi>l.</hi> Stock.</p>
                        <p>IV. And there is another Clause which hath not been mentioned by
the Councel on either side, that if it should hereafter appear to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
or his Successors, that that Grant or the continuance thereof shall
not be profitable to his Majesty, his Heirs and Successours, or to
this Realm, that after three years warning under the Privy Seal or Sign
Manuel, the same should be utterly void.</p>
                        <p>For Plea, the Defendant says by an Act of Parliament made 15 <hi>E.</hi> 3.
It is enacted, that the Sea shall be open for all Merchants to pass with
their Merchandizes where they please, and that the Defendant by vertue
of that Act, and according to the Common Law of <hi>England</hi> did Traffick
within those places mentioned in the Declaration without any Licence,
and against the will of the Company as the Plaintiffs have declared <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ut
ei bene licuit.</hi>
                        </p>

            <p>
               <hi>Plaintiff Demurrs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the debate of this Case at the Bar there were several matters dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
of, but at length by the consent of both sides, as I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
the Case was resolved into these two Points.</p>
            <p>I. Whether these Letters Patents giving or granting Licence or Liberty
to the Plaintiffs to exercise the sole Trade to the <hi>Indies</hi> within the limits
of their Grant, with prohibition to all others, be good in Law.</p>
            <p>II. Admitting the Grant good, whether this Action be maintainable
for the Plaintiffs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:55333:4"/>
Now to let me into the Debate of these two Points: I think not
amiss to remember some things that have been mentioned by the
Counsel that I think are no ways in Question.</p>
            <p>I. At this time I conceive therefore, that whether the King may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
his Subjects from going beyond the Seas by Writ, or otherwise,
by his absolute Prerogative without giving any reason, is not the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
nor sure was it ever thought a Question till it was lately stirred at
the Bar. For the Writ in <hi>Fitz. N. B.</hi> 85. and the Register import no
such thing, and our Books say, the Surmises mentioned in those Writs
are not traversable: so is <hi>Dyer</hi> 165. &amp; 296. for surely the King may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
his Subjects from going beyond Sea, and is not bound to give
any reason for his so doing; but that is not now in Question.</p>
            <p>II. In the next place, I do not conceive there is any difference (tho
much discourse hath been about <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi>) whether the <hi>East-Indies</hi>
were at the time of the Grant of this Patent inhabited by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
or Infidels; tho by the way in the debating of this Case, I shall
shew, perhaps that matter may in some measure affect the Defendant,
but will not at all affect the Grant to the Plaintiffs. So that I conceive
that whether this Country or Place, or any other be inhabited by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
or Infidels that is not otherwise provided for by Act of Parliament,
will make but the same Question.</p>
            <p>III. Whether every Clause and Article in these Letters Patents, <hi>viz.</hi>
Touching forfeiture of Ship and Goods, Imprisonments, or divers other
clauses contained in the Charter be legal or not, is not now in question.
For surely it would be hard to maintain them all, and therefore the
Plaintiffs Councel have avoided those Questions by bringing this Action;
and tho the Defendants Councel have mentioned them, yet surely it
was onely intended to fully the Cause, and not that they thought
them to affect the Question.</p>
            <p>IV. Nor is it the Question, Whether by this Grant to the Plaintiffs
the King has fettered or confined his Prerogative by putting in a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to exclude himself from granting Licences to others of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to trade within the limits of the Plaintiffs Charter; tho Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>'s
(always a friend to the Kings Prerogative) in tenderness and care
thereof seemed to be surprised by the inconsiderate extravagancy of the
Grant, and would have us believe that he was afflicted with the dismal
Consequences that must necessarily ensue by the King's parting with so
great a Prerogative, and that either by the advice, consent, or the inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency
of his Attorney General and the rest of his Councel, by
having a greater regard to the <hi>East India</hi> Company for the sake of their
Money than they had to the King in discharge of their duty. To acquit
them and us therefore of that Dilemma, I am of opinion, though it
makes nothing to the question that is now before us: The King may
grant Licences to any of his Subjects to trade to the <hi>Indies</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Charter or any Article, Clause or Condition therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to the contrary, and notwithstanding any Caution or adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement
that in his argument he gave to the King, or his reflection that
he made upon his Councel either for their ignorance or hasly inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
in the passing of that Grant; and I am the rather induced to be of
that persuasion, for that the most learned of our Profession whose Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
have been quoted by him and others that have argued on the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55333:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
side were then of the Kings Councel, and were privy to, and
advised both these Letters Patents and all others of the like nature that
have been granted for these hundred years last past. I therefore think
fit to say, that I believe Mr. Attorney General, and the rest of the King's
Councel have discharged their Duty as well to the King, by maintaining
of this Grant, as Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> has in this instance manifested his
Loyalty by endeavouring to destroy it. In short therefore, as I said
before, every Clause in this Charter is not to be maintained, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is not to affect the Question now to be determined.</p>
            <p>V. Whereas it has been objected, that tho upon the Pleadings it is
agreed, that the Defendant never was a Member of the <hi>East-India</hi>
Company, nor had any Licence from them to trade to the <hi>Indies,</hi> yet
he might have a Licence from the King, which, as I conceive, the King
is not debarred to grant by any Clause in the Letters Patents; yet I
am of opinion, that if the Defendant had any such License, it ought to
have been shewn on his part, which not being done, it ought to be taken
by us, as I believe the truth of the Fact is, the Defendant never had any
such Licence.</p>
            <p>VI. It was observed, that the Plaintiffs in their Declaration had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
that this Trade could not be managed but <hi>per hujusmodi Corpus
Corporatum;</hi> and by this means they had excluded the King from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting
any more Companies to trade within their Limits, tho per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the advantage of this Kingdom might hereafter require it: Nay,
tho the <hi>Indians</hi> might desire a further Treaty of Commerce, or that
the Trade of these places might require more Companies to be erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
yet say they, this Grant hath made the Plaintiffs a mere Republick,
and thereby has altered the Constitution of <hi>England</hi> in the management
of Trade by Common-wealths, by placing it in Companies, who (were
they Independant upon the Crown) are truly so called. Yet in as much
as I did before observe, that the King is not by this Grant either exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from making any new Treaties with the <hi>Indians,</hi> or from making
any Corporations or granting any other Licences to any of the rest of
his Subjects, notwithstanding any of the Clauses in the Charter: So I
am of opinion, that that Objection also does not affect the Question
now to be determined, and for that reason amongst others, I thought
it not improper to mention that Clause in the Charter that was omitted
at the Bar, which the King has annexed as a Condition to his Grant, that
if it should hereafter appear to his Majesty or his Successors, that that
Grant or the continuance thereof in the whole or in any part, should
not be profitable to his Majesty, his Heirs and his Successors, or to this
Realm, that after three years warning by War, under the Kings Seal or
Sign Manual, should be made utterly void. So that it appearing that
the King hath neither divested himself of the power, nor at the time of
the Grant did design to be prevented to shew his inclination for the
promoting of the advantage of his Kingdom, has given himself scope
enough to obviate all those Emergencies. Yet by the way I cannot but
observe, that Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> to shew his dislike to a Commonwealth,
declared it to be absolutely opposite to the interest of a Single Person,
but the Single Person he concerned himself for was not the King and
his Prerogative, but his Client the Defendant, and his Trade, who tho
I cannot in propriety of Speech call a Commonwealth; yet I cannot


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55333:5"/>
but think this opposition of his seems to proceed from a Republican
Principle; for he by his Interloping has been the first Subject that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this Kingdom for near an hundred years last past, hath in <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>-Hall
publickly opposed himself against the King's undoubted Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
in the Grant now before us; and I hope by this Example the
rest of his Majesties Subjects will be deterred from the like disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p>There were some other superfluous Objections made against the
Clauses in the Charter, and against the Formality of the Pleadings,
which I think not necessary to remember, and therefore having thus
premised, I shall now descend to those Points I think only material in
this Cause.</p>
            <p>I. The first and great Point in this Cause, is, Whether this Grant of
the sole Trade to the <hi>Indies,</hi> to the <hi>East-India</hi> Company exclusive of all
others, be a good Grant in Law or not, and I am of opinion it is, and
by the way I cannot but make the same remark in this Case as my Lord
Chief Baron <hi>Flemming</hi> made in the great Case of <hi>Bates</hi> in the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,
Lane,</hi> fol. 27. that it is a great Grace and Eminent Act of
condescension in the King to this Defendant, that he does permit this
great Point of his Prerogative to be disputed in <hi>Westminster</hi>-Hall; but
by this he does sufficiently signifie to all his Subjects, that he will persist
in nothing, though it seem never so much for his advantage, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Laws of the Land. I shall therefore endeavour to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that he is invested with this Prerogative by the Law of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
But by the Law I do not only mean the customary Common Law
or Statutes of this Realm which are Native and peculiar to this Nation,
which as Mr. Attorney well observed are not adapted to this purpose.
But such other Laws also as be common to other Nations as well as
ours, and have been received and used time out of mind by the King
and people of <hi>England</hi> in divers Cases, and by such antient Usage are
become the Laws of <hi>England</hi> in those Cases; namely, the General
Law of Nations, the Law-Merchant, the Imperial or Civil Law, every of
which Laws so far forth as the same have been received and used in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
time out of mind, may be properly said to be the Laws of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the better communicating my Thoughts upon this Subject,
I will proceed by these Steps:</p>
            <p>1. I will very briefly consider of the Inland Trade within this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and the Forein Trade with other Nations, and therein observe
that the King's Prerogative is concerned in both, and that there is a great
difference between both allowed by the Municipal Laws of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>2. I shall shew that the Liberty of Forein Trade may be restrained.</p>
            <p>3. That Forein Trade and Commerce being introduced by the Law
of Nations, ought to be governed and judged according to those Laws.</p>
            <p>4. That by the Laws of Nations the Regulation and restraint of
Trade and Commerce is reckoned <hi>Inter Juris Regalia,</hi> i. e. the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
of the Supream Magistrate.</p>
            <p>5. That though by the Laws of this Land, and by the Laws of all
other Nations, Monopolies are prohibited, yet Societies to trade, such
as the Plaintiffs, to certain places exclusive of others, are no Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
by the Laws of this Land, but are allowed to be erected both


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55333:5"/>
here and in other Countreys, and are strengthened by the usage and
practice of both, in all times.</p>
            <p>6. I shall shew the Authorities that are extant in our Books, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with such Presidents, Reasons both publick and politick; for as
my Lord <hi>Fleming</hi> says, that such Reasons are good directions for our
judgments in such Cases as these; being demonstrations of the course
of Antiquity; and therein also observe the necessity and advantage of
such Societies, and by the way endeavour to answer the several Acts
of Parliaments, Presidents and Authorities, with all other the objections
that have been made against my Conclusion.</p>
            <p>1. First then, to consider the difference between the Inland and the
Forein Trade allowed of in our Books, and that the King's Prerogative
doth affect both. As to Manufactures under which all sorts of Artificers
are concerned, I think they remain with the most Liberty by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law; and as Mr. Attourney observed, the Publick-weal is little
concerned therein, only to preserve every one in the quiet enjoyment
of the fruits of his own labour and industry, yet even in that the
King's Prerogative hath not been totally excluded; for as it is taken
notice of in our Books, that all things that are this day enjoyed by
Custome or Prescription, had their Commencement by Royal Grant,
and by that means no Artificer within the City of <hi>London</hi> can at this
day use two Trades, <hi>i. e,</hi> a Carpenter cannot use the Trade of a Joyner,
or a Bricklayer of a Plaisterer.</p>
            <p>2. As to the Trade of Merchandize or Inland Commerce generally
speaking, it had the next Freedom by the Common Law, but was subject
nevertheless to be limited or restrained by the King's Prerogative in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
particulars. As for instance, to prevent all forestalling and ingrossing.</p>
            <p>So Mr. Attorney did well observe, that numbers of people could
not meet to traffick or Merchandize without being in danger of being
punished as unlawful Assemblies, the Crown therefore granted the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of Fairs and Markets for the sake of Commerce and Trade; all
which did originally proceed from the Crown, and therefore by abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
those liberties may still be forfeited to the Crown; and passing by
all other instances, I shall only instance one taken notice of in our Books,
which well considered may go a great way in the Case at the Bar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister,
<hi>fol.</hi> 107.</p>
            <p>The King grants to the Abbot of <hi>Westminster</hi> and his Successours,
that they should hold a Fair at <hi>Westminster</hi> thirty odd days together,
with a prohibition that no Man should buy or fell within seven Miles
of that Fair during that time, and the King does there command the
Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> by his Writ to seize the body of an Inhabitant of
<hi>Salisbury</hi> for selling Cloaths in <hi>London</hi> within the time of the Fair:
Now here is a Charter granted to a particular Person exclusive of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
for a time subject to more Objections than the Charter now in
Question, yet approved of by our Books.</p>
            <p>Hence it came that Corporations were erected, and Trade con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to Places and Persons exclusive of others; for all such came
originally from the Crown, and as I said before in the Case of
Fai<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, so I may now say in the Case of Corporations, that though
they claim Liberties and Privileges by prescription: yet these origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
proceeded from the Crown, and are therefore forfeitable to the


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55333:6"/>
Crown, an Eminent instance hereof is that great Case of the City of
<hi>London</hi> for abusing their Liberties, which they claimed by prescription
confirmed by divers Charters and Acts of Parliament by Judgment of
this Court, their Liberties and Franchises were seized into the King's
Hands, and therefore remain as a Vill to all intents and purposes till his
Majesty shall be pleased of his Bounty to restore them.</p>
            <p>Now that the Inland Traffick is most concerned either in Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Markets or Fairs which all proceeds from the Crown, does plainly
evince that the King's Prerogative has a more immediate influence over
Dealings in Merchandizes than it has over other Mechanick Crafts and
Mysteries; and that as Mr. Attorney did well observe to prevent
Frauds, Deceits and other abuses either in Weight, Measures, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
which would certainly interrupt such Commerce; but our Law
goes yet a Step further, and allows further difference between Inland
Merchandize and Forein, and allows a different way of determining
Controversies that arise thereupon, the Common Law and Statutes of
this Realm allowing the Law-Merchant, which is part of the Law of
Nations, should decide such Controversies to. <hi>Decimo tertio H. 4. fol.</hi> 19.
a Complaint made to the King and Council of some goods taken away
from a Merchant; it was moved in that Case, that the matter might
be determined at the Common Law, but the Lord Chancellour said,
that the Suit being brought by a Merchant who is not bound to sue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Common Law to have his Cause tried by twelve Men,
and to observe the other Solemnities of our Law, but shall sue in <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery</hi>
according to the Law of Nature, which is the Universal Law of the
World. And it is in that Case agreed by all the Judges, that if Forein
Merchandize were stoln or waived, they could not be seized as other
<hi>England</hi> Merchandizes might be by the Rules of the Common Law, as
Waifs and Strays, which shews plainly there is a difference in the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of our Law between forein Merchandizes that cross the Seas,
and other Inland Goods and Commodities. If two Merchants be Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
in Merchandizes, one shall have an Action of Accompt against
the other <hi>secundum Legem Mercatoriam,</hi> says the Register, <hi>fol.</hi> 135. and
<hi>F. N. B. 117. D.</hi> and yet by the Rule of the Common Law, if two
Men be jointly possessed of other Goods which are no Merchandize, the
one cannot bring an Action of Accompt against the other, if one of the
Merchants dies, the Executor may bring his Accompt against the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viver
for his moiety. <hi>Reg. 135. F. N. B.</hi> 117. but if it were a Copart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nership
for other Goods, it would survive <hi>per Jus accrescendi</hi> according
to the Rules of the Common-Law.</p>
            <p>In an Action of Debt upon a Simple Contract, the Defendant may
wage his Law, but it is otherwise in a Contract about Merchandize in
<hi>Lanes</hi>'s Reports, <hi>Bates</hi>'s Case agreed, <hi>Reg. 260. A.</hi> At Common Law,
the Goods of Ecclesiastical Persons were excused from Toll; but says the
Writ <hi>dum tamen Merchandizas aliquas non exercitat de iisdem,</hi> it shews
that then they fall under another consideration; if one Man wrongs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Man of his goods, here an Action of Trespass will lie; but if a
Merchants goods be taken upon or beyond the Seas, there must be a
Writ of Reprizal to obtain Satisfaction, the Parliament Roll, 3 <hi>Ed. 1. M.
19. in Archivis Turris Londini,</hi> where the Bayliffs of <hi>Southampton</hi> are
commanded by Writ, <hi>quod omnes Mercatores Leodienses ad partes Angliae


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55333:6"/>
accidentes per bona &amp; Catalla sua distringantur secundum Legem Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catoriam
&amp; Consuetudinem regni ad satisfaciendum Mercatoribus Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinis,</hi>
&amp;c. Where by the way observe, that <hi>Lex Mercatoria,</hi> which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
from the ordinary Common Law, is said to be <hi>Consuetudo regni
Angliae,</hi> by which we may observe, that Forein Merchandizes and
Traders differ from others in the Eye of Law, even by the allowance
of the Common Law it self.</p>
            <p>Several Acts of Parliament have been also made for the more speedy
Recovery of Debts contracted for Merchandizes, as the Statute of
Action <hi>Burnel,</hi> the Statute <hi>de Mercatoribus,</hi> and the Statute <hi>Vicesimo
Septimo, Ed. 3. Cap.</hi> 2. Amongst other things it is enacted, That for
Merchandizes taken away, the Party shall be arrested, and speedy and
ready Process shall be against him from day to day, and from hour to
hour according to the Law-Merchant, and not at the Common Law.
So the Statute for erecting the Court of Ensurance designed for the
speedy ease of Merchants, has left the determination according to the
Law of Merchants, and therefore hath ordered the Judg of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty's
Court always to preside in those Commissions: by all which I
think I may fairly conclude there is a great difference allowed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Inland and Forein Commerce; and that,</p>
            <p>II. I shall endeavour to prove that the Liberty of Forein Trade may
be restrained.</p>
            <p>And here I must premise, that as at first all Things were promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
common and undivided to all, so the free Exercise of this Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Right was then instead of Property; but as soon as the number of
men increased, and they found by experience the inconveniency of
holding all things in common, things were reduced into Property by
agreement and Compact, either Express as by Partition, or implied
by <hi>Primier Occupancy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this Government was established, and Laws were made even
for the ordering those things to which no man had any Right. As for
Example, Deserts, Places uninhabited, Islands in the Seas, Wild Beasts,
Fishes and Birds, the former were usually gained and disposed of by
him that had the Sovereignty over the People; the latter by him that
had the Dominion over the Lands and Waters, who might forbid all
others from Hunting, Fishing, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And in Vertue of this Universal Law, his Majesty and his Predecessors
have always disposed of the several Plantations abroad that have been
discovered or gained by any of their Subjects, and may do for the future
in case any other be discovered and acquired. For tho the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
can command nothing which the Law of Nature forbids: yet
they may bound and circumscribe that which the Law of Nature leaves
free, and forbid that which naturally may be lawful. Now to
apply this to our present purpose of Trade and Commerce, Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi>
quoted that common saying, <hi>Commercia debent esse libera,</hi> from
whence he infers, that by the Law of Nature and Nations, the Sea and
Trade, and Traffick ought to be free as the Air, and for that he has cited
<hi>Grotius de Jure Belli ac Pacis, Cap. 3. Wellwoods</hi> Abridgment of Sea-Laws,
in his Epistle to the Lord Admiral; <hi>Grotius de Mari libero,</hi> where he
says, <hi>Mare &amp; Littora Maris Jure Gentium sunt communia. Britton, Cap.
33. De perchase le mere &amp; le air sunt thores Common.</hi> Sir <hi>John Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi>


               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:55333:7"/>
his Sovereignty of the Seas. <hi>Baldus de rerum Dominiis.</hi> But I
think none of those Books can warrant his conclusion, for surely that
Expression <hi>Commercia sunt libera,</hi> cannot possibly be understood in such
a literal sense, that every man in every Nation should be at liberty to
trade either in what Commodities, or to what place or at what time
soever he shall think fit; for I took it to be granted by all that argued
for the Defendants, that Trade and Commerce must be subject to some
Laws; and <hi>Grotius</hi> in his Book <hi>de Mari libero,</hi> proposes this main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to prove, that any one Nation had not power to hinder another
Nation from free Commerce, and that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> therefore had no
right to prohibit the <hi>Dutch</hi> from trading into such part of <hi>Indies</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were not possessed, upon pretence that they had the
Dominion of those Seas, <hi>Inter Nos &amp; Hispanos,</hi> says he, <hi>heac Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versia
est, sitne immensum &amp; vastum Mare regni unius nec mariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi
accessio? Populóne unquam jus sit volentes populos prohibere ne ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,
ne permutent, ne denique commeent inter sese;</hi> and for the benefit
of his Countrymen he doth therefore assert, <hi>licere cuivis genti quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis
alteram adire cumque ea negotiare,</hi> which, taking that to be true
which by the Law of Nations is certainly otherwise: yet nothing can
be inferred from thence but onely the Question of Commerce between
one Nation and another, and how that was before Leagues and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
were made, little may perhaps be found, as Mr. Attorney well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
besides the Laws of Hospitality, which do not give any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandable
Right; but surely <hi>Grotius</hi> there hath no particular respect to
particular Subjects of this or any other Nation, how far the Supream
Power of any Nation may erect a Society of Trade to a certain place, and
for certain Commodities exclusive of all other Subjects of their own.</p>
            <p>And that plainly appears both from the Scope of his Book, as also
for that for several Years both before and at the Time of publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Treatise, the <hi>Dutch East-India</hi> Company was established,
which I shall have farther occasion to discourse of by and by. As
for <hi>Welwood</hi>'s Epistle, I have seldom observed that Epistles have
been cited in <hi>Westminster-Hall</hi> as Authorities: yet supposing it to
be so, that all loyal Subjects shall have their Petition granted to
Safety and Security in their Trade; I suppose <hi>Welwood</hi> little dreamt
of Interlopers, when he talked of loyal Subjects, if it can be meant
only of such who may trade by Law, that is, to beg the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in respect of the Plaintiff and Defendant: as to that of <hi>Britton</hi>
that the Sea is common, it is answered, by what hath been said before.
And <hi>VVelwood</hi> Page 66. says that by <hi>commune</hi> or <hi>publicum</hi> is meant
a thing common for the Use of any one sort of People, according to that
saying, <hi>Roma communis Patria est,</hi> but not for all of all Nations; <hi>VVel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>
page 66. That Passage of <hi>Burrough</hi> is only observed to prove the
Kings Prerogative within the four Seas. And though Mr. <hi>VVilliams</hi>
would have insinuated, as the Sturgeons and other great Fish and
Wrecks and the like had come to the King by the Statute of the 17.
E. 3. C. 11. that Act was but a Declaration of the common Law, for
he had it by the Right of his Prerogative, <hi>Plowden's</hi> Commentaries
in the Case of Mines, <hi>Cook</hi> 5. Sir <hi>Henry Constable</hi>'s Case; these things
were vested in the King by his Prerogative by the common Law, yet
I cannot but observe that the Treatise of <hi>Mare liberum</hi> on which Mr.


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55333:7"/>
               <hi>Williams</hi> so much relyed, was craftily writ to overthrow the King's
Prerogative in that beneficial Part thereof, relating to the Fishing on the
English Coasts; and contains a plain Proclamation for all Persons of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Nation indifferently to Fish in all kinds of Seas, for says cap. 5. fol.
10. <hi>quae autem Navigationis eadem Piscatus habenda est ratio, ut com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munis
maneat omnibus;</hi> and herein though Mr. <hi>VVilliams</hi> intends to
make good the Premisses; I presume that Mr. <hi>Pollexfen</hi> that argued
on the same side, has a greater concern for his Friends in the <hi>West</hi> than
to join with him to make good that conclusion. And before I go off
from this Point, I think it not amiss, the better to clear the way to my
conclusions, to give some Instances wherein other Nations as well as
our own, have not onely thought it legal, but necessary for their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
publick Advantages to put restrictions upon Trade, and did not
think it injurious to natural Equity, and the Freedom of Mankind so
much discoursed of on the other side. To give some few instances: <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus
Jura Commerciorum,</hi> says <hi>Bodin de Repub.</hi> lib. 1. chap. 7. <hi>Non
solum omnibus populorum principumque inter se conventis, verumetiam
singularum Statutis,</hi> &amp;c. And after he has enumerated the Compacts
for Trade between the Pope and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> between the Citizens of
the <hi>Hantz</hi> Towns, and the Kings of <hi>England, France, Spain,</hi> and several
other Countreys: <hi>illi,</hi> says he, <hi>inter se Commercium multis modis perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narum,
mercium, locorum, temporum atque omni aliâ Ratione coarctarunt.</hi>
So is <hi>Marguardus,</hi> fol. 155. and <hi>Buchanan</hi> in his 7th Book <hi>de rebus
Scotiae,</hi> and in all Countreys the Importation and Exportation of some
Commodities, are prohibited, as Salt from <hi>France,</hi> Horses from other
Countreys, Wool from hence. In whomsoever that Power of restraint
does remain the Power of Licensing some and restraining of others
surely does also remain by parity of Reason; but of that more by and
by: and as Mr. Attorney did truly observe upon perusal of the Statutes
that are now in Print relating to Trade, the Parliaments have in all Ages
even to this Kings Reign since his Restauration, thought fit to make
more Laws to prohibit forein Trade than to encrease it, as looking
upon it more advantageous to the Common-weal. And thus having
observed that other Nations as well as we have not onely thought it le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,
but necessary to make Laws for the restraint of Trade, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
thought they did no injustice to the Liberty of Mankind,</p>
            <p>III. I proceed to the next Step. I shall therefore thirdly, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to prove that Forein Trade and Commerce being introduced by
the Laws of Nations, ought to be governed and judged according to
those Laws, and I do not know of any Statute or Book of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law now in Print that doth oppose this Assertion, <hi>Cokes 3. Inst.
fol.</hi> 181. in the Margin cited by the Defendants Councel at the Bar;
<hi>Commercium,</hi> says he, <hi>Jure gentium esse debet;</hi> nay, it is the Express
Text of the Law, <hi>ex Jure Gentium Commercia sunt instituta,</hi> which
being laid down as undeniably true, and so admitted to be by the
Defendants Councel; I would infer from thence, since Commerce and
Traffick are founded upon the Law of Nations by the natural reasons
of things, all Controversies arising about the same, should be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the same Laws, especially where there is no positive and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Law in that Countrey where such Controversies do arise to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
them by. And Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> seems to allow, that these are


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55333:8"/>
no such Laws in this Kingdom, for he thinks that the Controversie now
before us is not to be decided, but by Parliament.</p>
            <p>All other Nations have governed themselves by this Principle, and
upon this ground stands the Court of Admiralty in this Kingdom, <hi>viz.</hi>
that there might be uniform Judgments given there to all other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the World in Causes relating to Commerce, Navigation, and
the like; and in as much as the Common and Statute Laws of this
Realm, are too straight and narrow to govern and decide Differences
arising about Foreign Commerce, and can never be thought to bear
any sort of Proportion to the universal Law of all Nations, as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
of all Foreign Trade, do necessitate them to contend for: It
will become us that are Judges in <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> for the better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
this Case, to observe the Methods used by our Predecessors
in determining such like Causes, and take notice of the Law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>The Common Law, by the several Authorities I cited before, takes
notice of the Law-Merchant, and as the Book of <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. before cited,
says it is part of the Law of Nations, and leaves the determination
to be according to that Law, the several Acts of Parliament I before ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
make a particular Provision, that matters of this nature should be
determined according to the Law-Merchant, which is part of the Law
of Nature and Nations, and is universal, and one and the same in all
Countries in the World, and therefore <hi>Cicero</hi> speaking of this Law,
says, <hi>Non erit alia Lex Romae, alia Athenis, alia nunc, alia post hac, sed &amp;
inter omnes gentes &amp; omni tempore una eademque lex obtinebit;</hi> and I the
rather thought my self obliged more industriously to search into the Law
of Nations, the better to enable me to give Judgment in this Case, the
Consequence whereof will affect the King's Subjects in all Parts of
the World, and I was minded thereof particularly, by my Lord
Chief Baron <hi>Flemming,</hi> in the giving Judgment in the great Case of <hi>Bates</hi>
about the Imposition upon Currants, <hi>Lane fol.</hi> 27. and does not only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it as necessary, but the common Practices of all Judges in all
Ages.</p>
            <p>Do not we leave the determination of Ecclesiastical Causes to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided
according to the Ecclesiastical Laws, Foreign Matters, Matters
of Navigation, Leagues, Truces, Embassies, nay, even in the Case at the
Bar, the stopping of the Defendants Ship by an Admiralty Process, was
left by the Opinion of all this Court, and afterwards by the Courts of
<hi>Common-Pleas</hi> and <hi>Exchequer,</hi> to be decided in the Admiralty, and by
virtue of a Process out of that Court, his Ship is detained to this day;
and as I said, that Court proceeds according to the Law of Nations, and
the Matters before specified, are not to be controled by the Rules of the
Common Law.</p>
            <p>And if Customs make a Law, then the Custom of Nations is surely
the Law of Nations, which brings me to my next particular, which is
the main thing upon which this Cause will turn.</p>
            <p>Therefore, <hi>4thly,</hi> I conceive, that both by the Laws of Nations,
and by the Common Law of <hi>England,</hi> the Regulation, Restraint and
Government of foreign Trade and Commerce, is reckoned <hi>inter Jura
Regalia, i. e.</hi> is in the Power of the King, and 'tis his undoubted Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
and is not abridged or controled by any Act of Parliament now
in force.</p>

This Question is not concerning the Consequences of this Power,
or any Inconveniences that may happen thereupon, because upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
arising, the King is to be supplicated to redress them, which
I shall farther take notice of, when I come to answer the particular Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
made against this Grant.</p>

These Rules and Principles asserted to be the Laws of Nations,
agree with the Principles of our Laws; Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> in his Argument
in this Cause cited many Records and Presidents to make good this
Assertion, which I think he did with great clearness: I therefore will
content my self with as few of them as I can, and only remind you of
such as I think absolutely necessary to make good my Assertion, which
I will do by these steps.</p>
            <p>I conceive the King had an absolute Power to forbid Foreigners,
whether Merchants or others, from coming within his Dominions,
both in times of War and in times of Peace, according to his Royal
Will and Pleasure, and therefore gave safe Conducts to Merchants
Strangers to come in in all Ages, and at his Pleasure commanded them
out again by his Proclamation or Order of Council, of which there is
no Kings Reign without many Instances; and the Statute of <hi>Magna
Charta,</hi> Chap. 30. so much insisted upon by the Defendants Councel,
is but a general safe Conduct; <hi>Omnes Mercatores nisi publice ante prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biti
fuerint habeant salvum &amp; securum Conductum, &amp;c.</hi> Where by the way
I must observe, That <hi>Mercatores,</hi> says my Lord <hi>Cook,</hi> in his Comment
upon the Chapter, is only intended of Merchants Strangers, for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
find, that in those days any of the Subjects of this Kingdom did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
themselves to foreign Trade, or at least the Trade was not so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable,
as to be taken notice of in any Book or Record that I can
meet with; and before the making of that Statute, my Lord <hi>Coke 2.
Institut. fol.</hi> 57. does agree, that the King might and did prohibit Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
at his pleasure: But he conceives, and with great respect be it spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to his Memory; I think, without any colour of Reason, would
make these words, <hi>nisi publice prohibeantur,</hi> to intend only a Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by Parliament; and his Reason is, for that it concerns the whole
Realm: Now did the coming in of Strangers concern the Realm, after
the making of the Act, more than it did before? Surely no. Doth not
the Power of making War and Peace absolutely belong to the King by
his Prerogative? and is not that of publick concern to the Kingdom?
and is not the Prohibition of Strangers, a natural dependant upon that
Prerogative? if the word <hi>publice</hi> there had been out, there had been no


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55333:9"/>
colour for that conceit, and surely the King's Proclamation will make
the matter as publick as an Act of Parliament can do; nay, and I may
say, more, for Acts of Parliament anciently were made publick by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation;
for in our Books we have many Instances of Writs direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Sheriffs of Counties, to cause Acts of Parliament to be published
by Proclamation, and so was the constant and ancient usage; and it
is not more natural for Strangers that are abroad to take notice of the
King's publick Edicts, which is known to be of great Importance in all
Countries, more than they would of an Act of Parliament, that affects
the King's own Dominions only; besides it appears more impertinent, if
you turn those words into a Proviso, and then it will amount to no more
in plain <hi>English</hi> than this, provided, that this Law shall continue, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it be hereafter repealed, which surely would be very ridiculous.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sollicitor,</hi> both in their Arguments, quoted se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Records and Precedents, where the King in all times after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of that Act, did prohibit Strangers from coming in, and did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
them out when they were here at pleasure; I shall not trouble you
with the Repetition of the Records, for they were many: Nay, the
King, when Acts of Parliament had prohibited, did grant safe-Conduct,
and of that sort, in <hi>Rolls</hi> Prerogative 180. you will find several Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and in the several Acts of Parliament, cited by Mr. <hi>Attorney,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the King's Prerogative, as to safe-Conducts it doth appear. <hi>Syder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyn,

prohibit the Importation of Foreign Goods; and whoever acted against
such Prohibition, forfeited his Ship.</p>
            <p>The King might prohibit any of his Subjects from going beyond the
Seas at pleasure, and recall them again as he thought fit; and that, as
I have said before, without giving any reason: the Books of <hi>Fitzherbert's
N. B.</hi> and Register before-cited, makes this evident: Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
cited many Instances, wherein the Kings had made use of their
Prerogatives,<note place="margin">Roll <hi>'s Ab. 2. fo.</hi> 214. Commons pray leave to export and import Foreign Goods at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, except Goods of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the contrary. <hi>Resp. le Roy voet estre ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel.</hi>

with many more; and indeed, I think, it was not deny'd, but that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a Prohibition it was an Offence, admitted of by the Defendants
Councel, for any Subjects to go beyond the Seas; <hi>Dyer</hi> 165. and 296.
agrees it.</p>
            <p>And that is sufficient for the present purpose, there being a Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the <hi>Charter,</hi> in question to all Persons that are not there mention'd.</p>
            <p>What influence the King's Prerogative must necessarily have upon Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Trade and Commerce, appears by his frequent granting Letters of
mark and reprizal, these are not allowed of by the Law of Nature, Civil
or Common Law; for thereby no man is bound by anothers Act, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his Consent, but by the general Consent of Nations, <hi>humana necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
exigente.</hi> The King only has the power of making Leagues and
Truces with Foreign Princes, upon which only all Foreign Trade does
depend, and those Leagues are made upon such Terms and Conditions,
and under such limitations, as both Princes think fit; many Instances
to this purpose were also cited by Mr. <hi>Attorney,</hi> to which I refer my self,
and the differences that arise from Merchants beyond the Seas, are to
be determin'd according to those Leagues, and cannot be decided by the
Municipal Laws of this Realm, which cannot be put in Execution in Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Parts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:55333:9"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The King is absolutely Master of War and Peace, which he
could not be, in case he had not a Power to lay restraint upon his own
Subjects, in relation to Foreign Commerce: Since <hi>eo ipso,</hi> that War is
proclaimed, all publick Commerce is prohibited, and the Councel that
argu'd for the Defendant, admitted, That the King might prohibit his
Subjects to go or trade beyond the Seas in cases of Wars or Plagues. How
strangely preposterous then would it be for a man to imagine, that the
King should have an absolute Power of War and Peace, and yet be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
of the means to preserve the one and prevent the other! Is not that
therefore the great Reason why the King is at so great Expence in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
Ambassadors and Envoys in all the Trading parts of the World,
without which, we should be in a perpetual state of War? Would it
not be monstrous, that when the King is entered into League with any
Sovereign Prince in a matter of Trade, very advantageous to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to have it in the power of any one of his Subjects to destroy it?
as for instance, Suppose a League between our King and the Emperor
of <hi>Morocco,</hi> for a Trade to <hi>Tangier,</hi> were made upon Condition, that
no <hi>English</hi> Ship coming there for Commerce should be above a hundred
Tun, and a Fleet of Merchants Ships within that Condition, were in
Port at <hi>Tangier;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sands</hi> with the same Obstinacy, as he seems
to appear in this Case, should have gone with a Ship of above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Tun to <hi>Tangier,</hi> that would have been an absolute breach of the
League, we should have been immediately in a state of War, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
Goods and Ships absolutely forfeited to the Emperor, by the
Law of Nations; and they and their Families thereby undone without
any remedy, till Mr. <hi>Sands</hi> should be pleased to return into <hi>England,</hi> and
also bring with him an Estate sufficient to make them a Recompence; and
then also, perhaps, it would be difficult to contrive such an Action in
our Law, to compel Mr. <hi>Sands</hi> to do it: besides, the King has no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way, if his Ambassadors and Ministers in Foreign Parts cannot
prevail, that right should be done to his Subjects; or if Mr. <hi>Sands</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terloping
Ship, and all its Cargo, had been wrongfully taken away from
him by any Foreign Prince, but by the King's declaring of a War, and
compelling them to make Restitution by force; the Consequence whereof
will affect more than Foreign Traders would be then concern'd, both
in their Persons and Purses, and it would be very hard for all the King's
Subjects to lie under the burden and charge, and the profits and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
accrue only to a few; and here by the way, I think it not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to take notice of an Objection, that was made by the Defendant's
Councel, of the unreasonableness that the King should be entrusted with
this Prerogative: For as well as he may restrain Persons travelling to
the <hi>Indies,</hi> he may also restrain them from Trading into any other part
of the World. The very Objection seems to carry an unsavory, as well
as an unreasonable mistrust in a Subject to his Prince; for as it is a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xim
in our Law, the King cannot be presumed to do wrong; and I am
sure the constant Practice of our Present King, has not given us the least
umbrage for such Diffidence: and I think I may truly say, we are as
safe by our Princes own natural Inclinations, as we can be by any Law
in this particular; the King has the absolute Power of pardoning all Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders,
by his inherent Prerogative, which an Act of Parliament can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deprive him of; the Case of Murther is a full Instance of that, nor


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55333:10"/>
was that Prerogative ever disputed in any Age, tho never so trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
saving in that single Case of the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> and that without
any Reason that I could ever hear of: Is it therefore to be objected, and
presumed, that the King will Pardon all the Traytors, Murtherers and
Robbers, and other Felons, and make use of his Prerogative to let all
Malefactors escape?</p>
            <p>The King is the Fountain of Honour, as well as of Justice, and in
vertue of that Prerogative, may ennoble as many of his Subjects as he
pleases, and thereby exempt them from Arrests, and other common
Processes of the Law, by means whereof Men do more speedily reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their just Debts, and have redress for Injuries. Is it therefore to be
presumed the King will make such a glut of Noblemen, because he
may do it?</p>
            <p>And as this is against his Inclination, so certainly it is against his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
to make such Grants as the Defendant's Councel seems to fear;
for it is more for the King's benefit than it can be for his Subjects, the
greater the Importation of Foreign Commodities is, for from thence
arise his Customs and Impositions, those necessary supports of the
Crown; and therefore in some sence the King is the only Person truly
concerned in this Question: For this <hi>Island</hi> supported its Inhabitants
in many Ages, without any Foreign Trade at all, having in it all things
necessary for the Life of Man.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Terra suis contenta bonis, non indiga mercis,</q> Says the Poet.</p>
            <p>And truly, I think, if at this day most of the <hi>East-India</hi> Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
were absolutely prohibited, tho it might be injurious as to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of some few Traders, it would not be so to the generality of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of this Realm. And therefore as I have offered these few In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
to prove the King should have such a Prerogative, in the next
place, I come to shew that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have exercised this their
Prerogative in all Ages; and as the King has the power of restraint of
Foreign Trade, so he is the only Judge when it is proper to use that
power, which seems plainly to be for the same reason: And, I think,
Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s remark of the difficulty of this Case, that it should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitate
the King to call a Parliament to assist him with power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
this Question, is not to be passed by without some Observation.</p>
            <p>God be praised 'tis in the King's power to call and dissolve Parliaments,
when and how he pleases, and he is the only Judg of these <hi>Ardua Regni,</hi>
that he should think fit to consult with the Parliament about; and Mr.
<hi>Williams</hi> would do well to save himself the trouble of advising the King
of what things are fit for him to consult with his Parliament about, till
such time as he be thereunto called; but it hath been too much practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
at this and other Bars in <hi>Westminster-Hall</hi> of late years, to captivate
the <hi>Lay Gens,</hi> by lessening the power of the King, and advancing, I had
almost said, the Prerogative of the People; and from hence comes the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mischiefs to the King's Subjects in parts abroad, by making the Power
of the King thought so inconsiderable, as tho he were a mere Duke of
<hi>Venice,</hi> being absolutely dependent upon his Parliament. Would it not
be mightily for the Honour and Dignity of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> think
ye, That the Emperor of <hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Morocco,</hi> or any Prince of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55333:10"/>
parts of the World should be told, that Mr. <hi>Sands</hi> one of the
King of Great <hi>Britains</hi> Subjects came into the Emperour's Territories
against his Prince's consent, and that he had no power to hinder him,
unless he would consult with all his Nobles and the Representatives of
all his common Subjects to assist therein? Would not the Emperour
believe <hi>Sands</hi> to be the greater Prince of the two? But though such
sort of Declamations are so much for the service of the Crown, and for
the Honour of the Kingdom as they would have it believed; yet I
think they have the same tendency of Duty and Service to the King,
with some other matters that of late have happened amongst us, <hi>viz.</hi>
Some have been so concerned as well for the safety and security of his
Majesties sacred Person, and to make him formidable to his rebellious
Subjects at home, as to desire that his Guards might be discharged,
because it looked as tho he designed to rule by a Standing Army, and
to shew their tenderness to his Sacred Life, would have him removed
from the assistance of evil Counsellours, as they called them, and put
himself into the hands of Assassinates, as though one murdered Prince
were not sufficient to satisfie that piece of State-policy, in one and the
same Age; and in order that he might have sufficient to support the
Necessity as well as Dignity of a Crown, which all good Subjects are
zealous for; some of late have industriously endeavoured to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
him from being able to borrow any Money upon the Credit
of any part of his Revenue; a priviledg that the meanest of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
concerned in that Question, would think themselves highly inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be debarred of: These and the like attempts if not prevented,
will render the King and his Government low and despicable in all
other parts of the World: and as for the instance between a Denizen
and a Man Naturalized, I think it rather makes against, than for Mr.
<hi>Williams</hi>'s Conclusion, as to the main Question; for though the King
cannot Naturalize a Man, and thereby give him inheritable bloud as
a natural born Subject to inherit Lands: yet he may make an Alien
a Denizen, and by that means he becomes to have as much priviledg
as any of the King's natural Subjects hath, as to Trade and Commerce,
which is the onely question now before us; and I cannot help being
of Opinion, that this Kingdom was in greater regard abroad, and the
Inhabitants thereof more prosperous at home, when the Prerogative
of the Crown was more absolute than now it is; therefore it is our
Duty as good Judges as well as good Subjects, to endeavour to support
it as much as we can by Law. And so I proceed to mention some
Presidents and Authorities, whereby the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have in all
ages exercised this part of their Prerogative of Restraining, disposing
and ordering matters of Commerce and Forein Trade by Royal Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences,
Charters and Dispensations.</p>
            <p>And herein I shall content my self with as much brevity as I can,
onely in producing some few of those many instances, which were
with great care and industry found out by Mr. Attorney, and Mr. Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitor,
and by them so learnedly and properly applied to the Case in
question.</p>
            <p>I. Therefore it has been well observed, that the Staples which were
the common and publick Marts for all Merchants to resort to, were
first erected by the King's Prerogative without any Act of Parliament,


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55333:11"/>
as it doth plainly appear by the several Acts of Parliament mentioned
at the Bar, either for setting the Places, or enlarging the Commodities
that were permitted to be brought to the Staple; for surely in all
times when the Staple was fixed in the Dominions of any other Prince,
that must be done by League, which none can make but the King. To
instance one Authority for all; the Stat. 2 <hi>Ed. 3. Cap.</hi> 9. expresly says,
It is enacted, that the Staples beyond the Seas, and on this side, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
by Kings in time past, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mr. Attorney and Mr. Sollicitor cited
several Records and other Acts of Parliaments, that allow this to be
the King's Prerogative absolutely, which I shall onely name, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
opened the particulars at large, <hi>viz. Vicesimo</hi> E 1. <hi>Plac. Parl.
Rolls: Abrid.</hi> fol. 108. 130. <hi>Octavo E 3. numero 20. 27 E. 3. Cap. 1.
43. E. 3. Cap. 1. 47. E. 3. N. 17. Prim. R. 2. N.</hi> 98. with many more,
which did not onely Licence Merchants to repair to their several
Staples, but prohibited them from carrying their Staple Commodities
to any other places; and the several Acts of Parliaments made touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Staple, onely inflicted greater Forfeitures upon the Persons of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending,
more than the King by his Prerogative did inflict, but neither
added to, or diminished any part of the Power of the Crown: the
truth whereof will also farther appear by the consent of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
plainly declared in several Statutes following, <hi>viz. 2 Hen. 5. Cap.
6. 2 Hen. 6. Cap. 4. 8 Hen. 6. Cap.</hi> 17, and 27. by which and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
other instances, both by Mr. Sollicitor and Mr. Attorney, I do
conceive it does plainly appear that the Statute of 2 of <hi>Ed. 3. Cap. 9.
Nono l. 3. cap. 1. Decimo quarto Ed. 3. cap.</hi> 2. the Stat. of <hi>Decimo quinto,</hi>
Ed. 3. mentioned in the Defendants Plea, <hi>Decimo 8. Ed. 3. cap.</hi> 3. which
the Defendants Councel have so much insisted upon for the opening the
Liberty of Trade, onely concerned Merchants of the Staples, and by
the Acts of Parliaments made relating to that Trade, since particularly
mentioned by Mr. Attorney stand now repealed.</p>
            <p>And tho the place of the Staple as well as the Commodities were
ascertained by Acts of Parliaments; yet the King granted to Merchants
Licences to trade elswhere, which Prerogative is allowed of by Acts of
Parliaments, and other Authorities in our Books: for instance, amongst
many others, the Stat. 8 <hi>Hen. 6. 21. 22 Hen. 6. cap. 4. 15 Hen. 6. cap. 3.
27 Hen. 6. cap. 1. 1 Hen. 7. fol. 3. A. 13 Ed. 4. fol. 3. l. 5 E.</hi> 4. 33.
amongst other Books make it appear.</p>
            <p>And as well as the King, before those Acts of Parliaments mentioned,
ordered the Merchandizes of the Staple, so all other Forein Trade
not taken notice of by Acts of Parliaments, were begun and absolutely
disposed of by the King's Prerogative; for as my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in his
Comment upon <hi>Magna Charta, cap.</hi> 30. does truly observe, that by
<hi>Mercatores,</hi> there onely is meant Merchant-strangers; for as I said, I
do not find that any of the Subjects of this King meddled in Forein
Trade in many years after the making of that Act: the first instance
I meet with, is in <hi>Malin's Lex Mercatoria, fol.</hi> 150. of the Society of
Merchants which is the Staples Adventurers, made by a Grant from
King <hi>Edw.</hi> III. and were called the Brotherhood of St. <hi>Thomas a
Becket</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> till the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. who confirmed their
Charter, but changed their Name to that of Merchant-Adventurers, by
which Name they continued a Corporation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:55333:11"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> And that the King did shut and open Forein Trade at his pleasure,
by many instances mentioned by Mr. Attorney and Mr Sollicitor, does
farther appear, 33 <hi>Hen. 3. memb. 1. 2 E. 3. pars secunda memb. 35.
3 Hen. 3. N. 33. Rolls Prerogative</hi> 170. and 214. before-cited, <hi>primo
Hen. 5. 41. decimo octavo Hen. 6. N.</hi> 60. and the Stat. of 12 <hi>Hen 7.
cap.</hi> 6. which I have caused to be searched; and in <hi>Plowden</hi>'s Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
in the great Case of Mines-Royal, it is set down as a Rule that
antient Charters and Grants of the Crown are the best Evidences of
the Prerogative. <hi>Phil.</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> erected the Corporation of <hi>Russia</hi>
Merchants by Charter, with a Prohibition to others with the like Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
within mentioned in the Charter at the Bar, and was afterwards
approved of in Parliament, in 8 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and the Forfeiture mentioned in
the Letters Patents made more effectual; and as Mr. Attorney did
truly observe, that when <hi>Callis</hi> was taken, and thereby the Staples un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setled,
Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> thought according to the President of the <hi>Russia</hi>
and other Companies, it was most advantageous for the carrying on
of Trade and Forein Commerce to erect Societies and Corporations,
which was well approved of in those times, and so has continued ever
since undisturbed until this present Question, which I shall more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
insist upon when I come to discourse of the next Head.</p>
            <p>And here by the way I shall onely remember, that there were many
Records and Books cited by the Councel at the Bar, to prove the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between alien Enemies and alien Armies, and how these <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels</hi>
are in Law look'd upon as perpetual Enemies, and the many Cases
that were cited about the <hi>Jews</hi> and others I think will not be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be farther insisted upon; for I conceive they do not concern the
Question that is now before us: for were not the Charter now in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
in being, it would be worth while for Mr. <hi>Sands</hi> to consider how
far he might be obnoxious to punishment for trading with <hi>Infidels,</hi>
who are in Law called <hi>Perpetui inimici,</hi> and therefore I conceive it is
as Penal for any of the King's Subjects to trade with <hi>Infidels</hi> who are
alien Enemies without a Royal Licence, as it is to trade with alien
Armies contrary to a Royal Prohibition: and I cannot conjecture how
he will avoid this Rock, notwithstanding his pretended skill in Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
without making use of this Charter as a safe-conduct to him
by Implication, though he seems here so much to struggle against, and
how far that would prevail for his benefit may be also considered.
But as I said before,</p>
            <p>IV. The true Question is, Whether this be a good Grant to the
Plaintiffs of a sole Trade to the <hi>Indies,</hi> were the Inhabitants thereof
Christians or Infidels exclusive of others, be good or not, is the true
Question, and therefore I proceed to the next Step, that though unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Engrossing and Monopolies are prohibited by the Laws of this and
of other Nations, yet I do conceive that the Charter now in question
of a sole Trade exclusive of others, is no such unlawful engrossing or
Monopoly, but is supported and encouraged as conducing to publick
benefit by the Law, Practice and usage of this and other Countreys:
and herein by the way, though the word <hi>Monopoly or Engrossing</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
spoken of are odious in the eye of our Law, yet some Engros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
and so some Monopolies are allowed of in our Books, and so I
desire to be understood, when I say <hi>a lawful or unlawful Monopoly,</hi> or


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55333:12"/>
               <hi>a lawful or unlawful Engrossing;</hi> and in as much as this is the great, and
as I think, the onely Objection that either hath or can be made against
the present Charter; I shall be the more particular in giving my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
therein, with the Reasons aud Authorities that have induced
me thereunto.</p>
            <p>I premise onely this, that in all those Countreys where Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Trade are erected by the Supreme Power exclusive of all others;
as the Case at the Bar, Monopolies are forbidden, and are as severely
punished by their Laws as they can be by the Common and Statute-Laws
of <hi>England,</hi> viz. in <hi>Holland, Germany, France, Spain,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And so where ever the Civil Law prevails, Monopolies are punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Confiscation of Goods and Banishment, <hi>C. de Monopoliis &amp;
Cens. Forens.</hi> part. 1. fol. 497.</p>
            <p>Now though Monopolies are forbidden, yet that cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
to be so universally true (as no general Law can ever be) that it
should in no respect and upon no occasion or emergency whatsoever
admit of any Exception or Limitation.</p>
            <p>The Exceptions thereof may be such as these:</p>
            <p>I. Though no private Persons can have the sole Trade to themselves
by their own private authority; yet this may be granted to a publick
Society by the Prerogative of the Prince; if</p>
            <p>II. It be upon good cause, and for the publick advantage of the
Kingdom.</p>
            <p>III. From the necessity of beginning and carrying on such Trades
and Forein Commerce, which can be onely done by Companies and
Societies.</p>
            <p>IV. Such Companies and Societies ought to be continued and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
upon the Natural Equity and Justice, that no other Persons
should be permitted either to reap the profit, or to endanger the loss
of what hath been begun and been carried on by them with great
hazard and expence.</p>
            <p>Now in as much as Forein Trade can never be of advantage to this
Kingdom, except the ballance be kept equal between this and other
Countreys, which can never be done but by keeping up to proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Rules, for the regulation thereof with the other Countreys: and
because as I said before, the Municipal Laws of this Realm seem too
scanty for that purpose, I will therefore first consider how this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
stands as to the Law, of Nations; and then how it is considered
by our Law, producing Authorities in both, to make good my Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and because I thought the former more natural and effectual for
the decision of this Question, made me more inquisitive than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
I should have been. <hi>Cujacius,</hi> lib. 16. <hi>obser.</hi> 23. distinguishes <hi>inter

            </p>
            <p>It has been a Question sometimes debated, Whether the Society
entred into by the <hi>Hanse Towns</hi> were not against Law: <hi>Quippe quod
speciem Monopolii prae se ferre videtur, ut certis locis merces emant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faederati
quae rursus pretio eo, quo volunt, vendant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the same Objection now made against the Charter at the
Bar.</p>
            <p>But the Answer given was twofold, and will come home to this
Case.</p>
            <p>I. That the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> IV. has given his approbation, and
made it lawful by his Authority.</p>
            <p>II. That they had continued in possession of this Society so long,
that now the length of time (together with the Prince's consent) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
all doubt whatsoever, <hi>Carpsovirez de Lege Regia Germanorum,</hi>
cap. 6. sect. 10. And the Charter now in Question, and other Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of like nature granted by the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> which I shall have
occasion to remember by and by, remained undisturbed without the
least interruption as long as this Society did before this Question was
stated.</p>
            <p>And though according to the Rules of our Laws, such a length of
time does not obtain the Credit of a Prescription; yet by the Law of
Nations and the practices of all other Countries which are only adapted
for this purpose, it is otherwise. <hi>Praescriptio enim tam longi temporis vim
legis obtinet, imo tollit omne vitium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:55333:13"/>

<hi>lib. 4. cap. 7. n.</hi> 50.</p>
            <p>And as these <hi>Hanse</hi> Towns were one of the first Corporations of
Trade, I have read of, so was it thought the Interest of <hi>England</hi> to
support and encourage them. I find above 60 (some say 80) Towns
and Cities united their Stocks, making <hi>Lubeck, Brunswick, Dantzick</hi> and
<hi>Cullen,</hi> the chief places of their Residence; and so great was their Trade
and Credit under that Constitution, that many Princes granted them
large Priviledges, and they kept Courts by their Deputies and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
at <hi>Bergen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the Laws of <hi>Spain,</hi> all Monopolies are forbidden, and under the
same Penalties appointed by the Civil Law: Yet there also a right may
be acquired to a sole Trade, by Licence obtained from the King, or by
Prescription.</p>

            <p>I come in the next place to make it appear, that as well as the Law
of Nations, and the Practice of all other Countries, warrants the like
Grants and Restrictions with the Case at the Bar; so I conceive this
Charter of sole Trade to the <hi>Indies,</hi> excluding others, is neither oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the Common Law, or prohibited by any Act of Parliament;
but is supported by both, as will more evidently appear by the practice
and constant usage in all times.</p>
            <p>Therefore, tho engrossing be a Crime, odious in the Law, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable;
yet all manner of engrossing is not.</p>
            <p>Therefore in the Case of Foreign Trade, which is only applicable to
the Case at the Bar, it was resolved by all the Judges of <hi>England, 3.
Instit.</hi> 196. That Merchants may buy beyond Sea in gross, and sell
here again in gross also; I say, that all Monopolies are not unlawful.
Generally speaking they are, and therefore I will admit the Descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of an unlawful Monopoly, made by my Lord <hi>Cook, 3. Instit.</hi> 181.</p>
            <p>A Monopoly, is an Institution or Allowance by the King, by his
Grant, Commission or otherwise, to any Person or Persons, Bodies Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
or Corporate, of or for the sole buying, selling, making, working,
or using any thing whereby any Person or Persons, Bodies Politick or
Corporate, are sought to be restrained of any Freedom or Liberty they
had before, or hindred in their lawful Trade.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:55333:14"/>
Now if the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> had not before this Grant, a freedom
and liberty to Trade to the <hi>Indies,</hi> against the King's Royal Pleasure,
the Charter at the Bar will be no Monopoly within that Rule.</p>
            <p>Now that they had no such liberty, hath been sufficiently proved by
the several Prohibitions mentioned before, and the many more Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
thereof cited by Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sollicitor;</hi> and it would be
very strange, that the King might prohibit Foreigners from coming here
into <hi>England,</hi> and not prohibit his own Subjects from going into Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Countries.</p>
            <p>And it is not denied, but if the King should Proclaim a War with
the <hi>Indians,</hi> that then it would be a Prohibition to all his Subjects to
have any Commerce with them; nay, and he might continue that
War as long as he pleases, and by that means all his Subjects would be
as well prevented of any of the Commodities of that Country: and
also of exporting any of our Commodities thither: So that surely this
Charter, with these Restrictions, is much better than a total Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion;
and therefore Foreign Trade is not like our home Trade, to
which the word Monopolies is properly applicable; for that cannot be
totally excluded for any time, tho never so small by any Act of Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Ay but, say the Defendant's Councel, tho the King can by
his Prerogative, prohibit all Trade to any Country upon such great
Emergencies as War and Plague, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet to grant liberty to some, and
exclude others, that makes the Grant at the Bar be thought a Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly,
which is still begging the Question; for if the King by his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,
have the power of restraining and disposing Foreign Trade,
where Acts of Parliament have not interposed, as by the Presidents al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
cited I conceive clearly he has as inherent to his Crown,
and therefore, as he may restrain all, so he may restrain any part by
the same parity of Reason.</p>
            <p>If the King proclaims a War with any Country, which is a general
Prohibition of Trade, and should order, that <hi>John a Styles,</hi> or a dozen
or any greater number of his Subjects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and give them Instructions
to treat for a Peace, and the Persons so appointed should carry on a
Trade, would not Mr. <hi>Sands,</hi> do you think, have as much reason to
murmur, that he was none of those Ambassadors, as he has now by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not comprized within the Charters? And would it not be thought
an Arrogancy and Sauciness in him to demand an account of the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
given by the King to such Ambassadors? or durst he Trade there
till a Peace were proclaimed with that Country?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the gloss upon that Law says</hi> Mercatores non faciant inter Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polium
de re non vendenda nisi pro certo pretio, vel de non exercendo offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
nisi per eos recipiatur Officiales &amp; Socios: Possunt tamen haec facere cum

bona Regi applicantur.</p>
            <p>Ex Privilegio ergo Regis possunt similiter &amp; Consuetudine vel praescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione,
quia quod Privilegio acquiritur, etiam praescriptione acquiri potest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And there quotes</hi> ubi dicitur, quod potest concedi Privilegium; quod

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> being <hi>Infidels</hi> are by Laws esteemed common Enemies,
and the Opinion of my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> in <hi>Michelboum</hi>'s Case I think therefore
to be Law, notwithstanding the Objections that have been made against
it, which none of our Books warrant; Now the King by his Charter
makes the Plantiffs as it were his Embassadours to concert a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Peace,
and Mr <hi>Sands</hi> murmurs because he is not one of them.</p>
            <p>The King may grant a Fair or Market to every Subject he has, but
because he grants that priviledg to some of his Subjects, have the rest
any just ground of complaint; because the King may pardon every
Offender, but will not pardon any Highway-men now in <hi>Newgate;</hi>
must those Goal-birds therefore think themselves injured in their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and property? Because the King granted to his Town of <hi>Hull,</hi>
that no other Ships should be there freighted for Forein parts, till the
Ships of that Town were first freighted, as he did <hi>Rot. Claus. 41.
E. 3. memb.</hi> 25. did <hi>London, Dover,</hi> or any other Town of Trade com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain?
Would any of these Gentlemen that contend for this liberty
of Trade, adventure with their Fortunes to <hi>Algiers,</hi> and when they
are seized upon by the <hi>Algierines,</hi> tell them we are English-men, and
we have by the common Law of <hi>England,</hi> and many Statutes of our
Kingdom, which support the liberty of the Subject, a freedom to
trade wherever we please? Or would not they rather say, we have a
Pass from the King of <hi>England,</hi> and rely upon that which presumes
Treaties, Leagues and Truces between Princes; and in case that will
not prevail, the King will see them righted: And in the Charter that
is now before us, there is a particular restriction and limitation of
Trade to any Prince in Amity with our King.</p>
            <p>Now as the constant Usage and practice of other Countries, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
such Societies as these, so does ours too: for as I said, the <hi>Hanse</hi>
Towns were some of the first Corporations of Trade that we read of
in History; so was it thought the Interest of <hi>England</hi> to support and
encourage them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>K. H.</hi> III. gave them great Priviledges and the Still yards for their
Residence, which they enjoyed near three hundred years, managing
their Trade by an Alderman and Council called <hi>the Guild of the Hanse,</hi>
engrossing the Trade of <hi>England</hi> for Grain, Cables, Masts, Pitch,
Tar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and under that colour the <hi>Jacobsons</hi> at this day claim se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Priviledges.</p>
            <p>It is observed by many Historians, that the most flourishing Trades
have been begun by united Stocks and Policies.</p>
            <p>In this Kingdom a Patent was first obtained for the erecting the Staple,
from <hi>E.</hi> 3. before any Act of Parliament intermedled in that Trade,
and proceeded under several Regulations till the time of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi>
In the Book I cited before <hi>Malyns Lex Mercatoria,</hi> fol. 150. says,


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55333:15"/>
this Company of Merchants are above four hundred years standing,
as that Book reckons from 1248. when the said Merchants obtained
Priviledges of <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and were called the Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of St. <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> which were confirmed by
King <hi>E. 3. H. 4. H. 5. E. 4. H. 6. R. 3. H.</hi> 7. who gave them the
Name of <hi>Merchant-Adventurers,</hi> and after him confirmed by <hi>H. 8.
E.</hi> 6. Q. <hi>M.</hi> Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> and King <hi>James,</hi> not without many Enemies and
Opposers, especially, says that Book of late, taxing them to be Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polies
and unprofitable to the Commonwealth, being that all our
Cloaths are not Dressed and Dyed in <hi>England,</hi> yet it still prevailed
as being thought for publick good.</p>
            <p>And its observable, that Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> did not only confirm what was
done by her Predecessors, but augmented and greatly enlarged the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of this antient Company, and confirmed the Charter on the
<hi>Muscovy</hi> Company, granted by <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> and set up several
other Companies, as that of <hi>Exeter</hi> mentioned at the Bar; the <hi>East-India</hi>
Company, the <hi>Levant</hi> and the <hi>East-land</hi> Company. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
that antient and beneficial Company of <hi>Staplers</hi> was often op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by particular Persons, and complained of as a Monopoly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching
upon the liberty of the Subject in several Parliaments in the
time of <hi>H. 4. H. 7. E.</hi> 6. and Q. <hi>Mary;</hi> yet all parties being heard,
these complaints were fully answered, and the Companies priviledges
ratified and enlarged.</p>
            <p>Again, In Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> time, the Cloathiers having prevailed against
the Company, the Cloathing countreys were almost quickly ruined
and reduced to that extremity, that the 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> the Lords of the
Council sent for the Members of that Company, desiring them to
reassume their Priviledges, and chearfully to proceed in their Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
with assurance of all Countenance and Assistance from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
And in the Reign of King <hi>James,</hi> after several Interlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
had endeavoured to destroy the Company, the King published his
Proclamation to restore the Company to its antient Priviledges.</p>
            <p>So did King <hi>Charles</hi> the First 7. <hi>Dec.</hi> 34. Reciting, <hi>Whereas we
have taken into our Princely consideration the manifold benefits that
redound to this Kingdom; and finding how much Order and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will conduce to the encrease and advancement of the same; We
have thought fit with the advice of our Privy Councel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </hi> There He
gives an establishment to the Company, and prohibits any to intrude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
their priviledges, upon pain of such punishments as the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi>
shall inflict.</p>
            <p>Since this it may be worth consideration, whether the breaking of
this Company has not occasioned the great decay of our Trade in
Wool: it being agreeable to reason, that as no Law can be effectual
without Courts of Justice to put them in execution, nor a stragling
Army subsist without Discipline: so a stragling Trade managed by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
persons, whilst every one strives to advance his own private
Interest, will ruine the Trade in general, especially such a hazardous
Trade as this to the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> which already hath been so charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and can onely be prevented by the Conduct and Government
of a publick Society: and surely to look after and settle these matters,
properly belongs to the care and prudence of our Governours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:55333:16"/>
Now I shall observe how the practice has been both in Qeen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi>
time and ever since, and that although many Charters like ours
at the Bar have been granted, and none ever demanded by any Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>Westminster</hi>-Hall, or so much as objected against, save onely
that of the <hi>Canary</hi> Patent, till this Cause at the Bar, and tho several
attempts have been made both in Parliament and in the Courts at
<hi>Westminster</hi>-Hall against Monopolies; yet this Charter and others
of the like nature were never look'd upon under that Character: for
instance.</p>
            <p>I. A Charter was granted 2. of <hi>Eliz.</hi> to the Merchants of <hi>Exeter</hi>
for the sole Trade of <hi>France,</hi> excluding all other Merchants of <hi>Exeter</hi>
not of that Company, continued undisturbed, and prevailed against a
great opposition that was made against it in Parliament. King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
VI. and King <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> having granted a Charter like
ours to the <hi>Russia</hi> Company, which continued in peace till the 8. of the
Queen, when the Parliament taking notice of that Patent, thought fit
to confirm it with all the commendations imaginable, and was so far
from thinking it a Monopoly, that it says, the Commonwealth before
that time had received great advantages by it, and grants, and inflicts
greater and other Penalties than were or could be inflicted by the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Patents: and it is observable, that there were some Interlopers
upon that Trade in those days, and had been liable to the Forfeitures
inflicted by those Letters Patents, and were therefore forced to apply
themselves to that Parliament, and did obtain a special Proviso to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
those Forfeitures, which had not that Act of Parliament been
made, they had been liable to, which I take to be an Authority full
as to the case at the Bar.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> during her Reign granted several Charters of the
like nature, which pass'd the perusal of her Attorney and Sollicitor,
learned Men in our Profession. In the beginning of her Reign my Lord
Chief Baron <hi>Weston</hi> was Sollicitor, Sir <hi>Gilbert Gerrard</hi> Attorney Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and pass'd those Patents both to the <hi>Russia</hi> and <hi>Exeter</hi> Companies:
23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> my Lord Chief Justice <hi>Popham</hi> was Attorney, and Lord
Chancellour <hi>Egerton</hi> Sollicitor, in whose times some few such Charters
were also granted like to this at the Bar: and then my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> was At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney
General, and my Lord Chief Baron <hi>Flemming</hi> Sollicitor General,
who approved thereof; and it is observable, that in the 43 and 44 of
the Queen, the Parliament took notice of many Patents of Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
as it appears by the Books cited at the Bar. <hi>Townsend</hi>'s <hi>Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
244 and 245. the Parliament seem'd to be as high as ever they
were in any Age before, and particularly were incensed by those Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents:
a list of all were brought in by Mr. Secretary <hi>Caecil,</hi> that were
thought grievous or prejudicial to the Commonwealth; and though
there were a Catalogue of forty or fifty, amongst whom that of <hi>Darcy</hi>
is one; yet the Parliament nor none other complained of any Charter
granted to Corporations, but they continued undisturbed. And by
the way 'tis not amiss to observe, that <hi>Darcy</hi>'s Patent was not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
damned in Parliament, but referred to take its fate in <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>-Hall;
the great reason that guided that Judgment was the restraint
that was put upon the Home-Trade; and so it appears in <hi>More's</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
672. and thus stood these Charters; the <hi>China</hi> Charter, the


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55333:16"/>
               <hi>Turky</hi> Company, the <hi>Barbary</hi> Company, the <hi>Guiny</hi> Company, all Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of sole Trade, excluding others, remained in Trade during all
Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time.</p>
            <p>But in the third year of King <hi>James</hi> was the first Act made for open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a general Trade to <hi>Spain, Portugal</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> to all the King's
Subjects, which could not be done in <hi>Westminster</hi>-Hall, as appears by the
Preamble to that Act; nor does that Act call those Charters Monopolies,
or open a free Trade to any other parts of the World, but leaves all
Charters of Forein Trade, save to <hi>Spain, Portugal</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> to remain
as they did before. And in the 4. <hi>Jac. cap.</hi> 9. there is notice taken
particularly of the Charter granted to the <hi>Exeter</hi> Merchants of the
sole Trade to <hi>France,</hi> and because it was thought to be damned by the
general words of that Statute <hi>D.</hi> 3. yet it is there enacted and declared
that the said Statute of Patents neither did or should dissolve, annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
or impeach the said Charter, or the said Company in any of their
Priviledges, Liberties, or Immunities granted unto them by the said
Charter, any thing contained in that general Act to the contrary not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding;
and from this Act of Parliament. I observe two things:</p>
            <p>I. That the Parliament thought that the Charter to <hi>Exeter</hi> for sole
Trade to <hi>France,</hi> exclusive of others, was for the publick benefit and
weal of that City.</p>
            <p>II. That the Letters Patents were good in Law, and did not want
the assistance of an Act of Parliament to support them; for that Act
does not confirm those Letters Patents, but provides onely that the
Statute 3. <hi>Jac.</hi> should not by general words be thought to Impeach
or destroy them. Now had the Parliament thought the Charter void
or infirm, they might have confirmed or strengthened it as the <hi>Russia</hi>
Patent was; but they concluded, that had it not been for the Statute
of <hi>tertio,</hi> the Charter was good to all intents and purposes: and this I
take to be a full Authority in the Case at the Bar. But to proceed,
the <hi>Greenland</hi> Patent for sole Fishing exclusive of others granted by
Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> is held good, <hi>Rolls</hi> part. 5. fol. 3. <hi>Taylor</hi> of <hi>Ipswich</hi> his
Case, and the Case of the Abbot of <hi>Westminster,</hi> is agreed to be Law
in <hi>Darcy</hi>'s Case, <hi>Moor</hi> 673. by Mr. Justice <hi>Doderidge;</hi> and by the
way, he gives good Advice to all Persons that dispute the King's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative;
and for the friendship I bear to Mr. <hi>Sands</hi> and others that
are now in Court, and I think need the Advice, I shall read the very
words of the Book, He that hews above his Hands Chips will fall
into his Eyes: <hi>Et qui majestatem serutatur principis opprimetur splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
ejus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In King <hi>James</hi>'s time many Grants like ours were made, but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
in 7. <hi>Jac.</hi> the Patent granted to the <hi>East-India</hi> Company by
Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> was the advice of all her Council, as well as by my Lord
<hi>Hubbard</hi> then Attorney General, and Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> Sollicitor Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
confirmed and allowed, with the same clauses as the Charter at
the Bar, and so remained undisturbed and uninterrupted all King
<hi>James</hi>'s Reign, and was not thought to be any whit touched or aimed
at by the Proviso in the Statute 43 <hi>Eliz. cap. 1. sect.</hi> 9. that Act only
pointing at the Monopoly Patents complained of in that Parliament
of 43 of the Queen, which I mentioned before: Then comes the Statute
so much insisted on by the Defendants Councel, commonly called <hi>the


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55333:17"/>
Statute of Monopolies,</hi> Stat. 21 Jac. <hi>cap</hi> 3. which certainly doth not
at all affect the Case at the Bar. For first, this Charter is not a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Grant for the sole <hi>buying, selling, making, using</hi> of any <hi>thing</hi>
within this Realm, which are the very words of the Acts: nor does
this Charter give the <hi>East-India</hi> Company, licence or toleration <hi>to do,
use, or exercise</hi> any <hi>thing</hi> against the <hi>tenour</hi> or <hi>purport</hi> of any <hi>Law</hi> or
<hi>Statute,</hi> which are the onely things provided against by that by Act.
But the Parliament then seemed to take the same general care of all
such Charters as this at the Bar, as the Parliament did in 3. <hi>Jacob.</hi>
of that particular Charter of <hi>Exeter;</hi> and therefore to the end that
those words in the beginning of this Act of Monopolies might not be
thought to extend to Charters to Corporations for Trade; there is a
Proviso, <hi>sect.</hi> 9. That that Act shall not extend to any <hi>Corporations,
Companies,</hi> or Fellowships, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> erected for the maintenance, enlargement
or <hi>ordering</hi> any Trade or <hi>Merchandize,</hi> but leaves the same as they
were before that Act without any Immutation: and it is observable,
that the Parliament then thought a General Saving sufficient to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
those Charters that were then in being, to Corporations for
Trade and Merchandize, but made particular Proviso's for the saving
of Patents for Inland Commodities, <hi>viz.</hi> such as Salt, Gunpowder, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
Shot, and the like.</p>
            <p>So that this Company was in full possession of their priviledge of
sole Trade, exclusive of others, all King <hi>James,</hi> and K. <hi>Charles</hi> the first
his time, till all the Prerogatives of the Crown were invaded, and the
crowned Head too was taken off by Traytors and Rebels, but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God having restored us our King, and reinvested him with
all his undoubted Prerogatives, as well as restored us to our antient
Rights and Priviledges, and scarce, as I may say, warm in his Throne;
but amongst the other considerations that he had for the publick
weal of his Subjects, he considers the publick advantage of this Kingdom
arising by Trade, and amongst them one of his first thoughts are fix'd
upon this Company: for the third of <hi>April,</hi> 1661. He by his Letters
Patents taking notice of the Charters of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King
<hi>James,</hi> granted to the <hi>East-India</hi> Company, and of the injuries that
were done to them by the late Troubles, with the advice of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
and approbation of Mr. Attorney <hi>Palmer</hi> and my Lord Chancellour
<hi>Finch,</hi> he granted and confirmed to them all their priviledges. The
27th of <hi>May</hi> in the 20th of his Reign, Lord Chancellour <hi>Finch</hi> being
Attorney, and my Lord Keeper that now is Sollicitor, he confirms
this Charter, and grants to the <hi>East-India</hi> Company other privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
by an other Charter in the 28th year of his Reign; at which
time the Lord Keeper was Attorney, and Sir <hi>William Jones</hi> Sollicitor:
he confirms the former, and grants more priviledges: and in the 25th
year of his Reign by the Charter now in question, passed with the
approbation of the present Attorney and Sollicitor, Men of great Ability
in their Professions, and of whom, were they not present, I should say
much more, the Charter to this Company was confirm'd with addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Priviledges.</p>
            <p>Nor has this Charter passed only the approbation of his Majesty and
Council since his happy Restauration, but the Parliament has likewise
taken notice of it; the Statute 14 <hi>Car. 2. cap.</hi> 24. takes notice of it,


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55333:17"/>
to be of great advantage to the Publick. The Stat. of the 29th of
this King for Pole-money, Taxes them at twenty shillings for every
hundred Pound in stock; in the great Case between <hi>Skinner</hi> and the
<hi>East-India</hi> Company, the House of Commons defended them, even to
an eruption between the two Houses.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Jenks</hi> and some other Linnen-Drapers and Tradesmen of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
taking the advantage of the Heats that too frequently possessed
the House of Commons of late years, especially against the Point of
Prerogative, did furiously attack the <hi>East-India</hi> Company, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any success; and this Company was never assaulted in <hi>Westminster</hi>
Hall till this Case at the Bar; I cannot help therefore this Observation,
that as the King by his Charter 1661, takes notice, that the Charters
granted by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> remain uninterrupted
till the late Rebellion; so the Interlopers against the King's Prerogative
in this particular, and the horrid Conspirators against the King's Life
in this last hellish Conspiracy, first appeared in <hi>Westminster</hi>-Hall about
the same time.</p>
            <p>As to the Objections I have not yet given answer to, I think they are
but few: my Lord <hi>Cokes</hi> Opinion cited by Mr. <hi>Pollexfen, 2 Instit.</hi> 540.
where my Lord observes new things which with fair pretences prove
hurtful to the Commonwealth; and amongst them reckons that new
Corporations trading into Forein parts and at home, which under the
fair pretences of Order and Government, in conclusion tend to the
hindrance of Trade and Traffick, and in the end produce Monopolies,
does not at all concern the Case at the Bar; for this Charter that hath
continued for one hundred years without any interruption till of late,
can neither be thought a new Corporation, or hindrance of Trade;
and Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> when he was Attorney General, and past this
Charter, was as learned in the Law as he was when he published that
Book, and was turned out of being Chief Justice, did not think this
Charter needed that Caution.</p>
            <p>As to the Case of the <hi>Canary</hi> Patent between <hi>Horn</hi> and <hi>Ivy,</hi> that
cannot affect the Case at the Bar.</p>
            <p>I. For first, The Judgment in that Case was given upon the point
of Pleading, and not upon the validity of the Patent.</p>
            <p>II. That Patent was in perfect opposition to that Statute 3. <hi>Jac.</hi>
that opened a free Trade to <hi>Spain,</hi> and therefore could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
by the King's Letters Patents, but there is no such Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to our Case.</p>
            <p>The Councel that argued for the Defendant seemed to allow the
Charters to the <hi>Virginia, Turkey,</hi> and <hi>Eastland</hi> Companies, which are
exclusive of others, to be good, because they're managed by a Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and not a Joint stock, which surely can make no difference; for
it is a Grant of a sole Trade to them exclusive of others as well as
the Case at the Bar, and it's as hard to get into the <hi>Turky</hi> Company
as it is into this, and may be more chargeable: for you cannot be a
Member of the <hi>Turkey</hi> Company, but you must be a Freeman of the
City of <hi>London,</hi> and makes you liable to all the great Offices of Charge
in that Government, but a Freedom of the <hi>East-India</hi> Company may be
purchased at a much easier rate; the Members of the <hi>East-India</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
are as visible as those of the <hi>Turkie:</hi> and though it was said, the


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55333:18"/>
               <hi>East-India</hi> Company were sometimes invisible, yet were the <hi>Turky</hi>
Company infected with so many Interlopers as the <hi>East-India</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
have, they would not appear so glorious and spendid as they now
do, and as I heartily wish they may long continue. But the King by
this Charter has reserved to himself a Power to destroy and alter
the whole Charter, or any part thereof, so as to put it into a way
of Regulation instead of a Joint-stock, in such manner as he shall
in his great Wisdom think fit; therefore it becomes us in Duty and
Modesty to wait till we receive his further Royal Pleasure therein.
And whereas it was objected at the Bar, because the King cannot lay
any Imposition upon Forein Trade, therefore he cannot restrain it:</p>
            <p>I do not know to what end that Objection was made, because it
does not affect the Question at the Bar; but lest it may obtain the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
that I presume was aimed at, I think not amiss to say, that even
at this day there is much more may be said in the maintenance of the
King's Prerogative in <hi>Westminster</hi>-Hall, in that Case, than can be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against his Prerogative in this; but in as much as that and several
other Objections against the Charter proceeded from unreasonable as
well as unmannerly mistrusts they have of the Crown; I cannot but
remember that his Sacred Majesty was not so mistrustful of them; for
he since his Restauration has bestowed upon his Subjects more than
all his Predecessors, put them all together since the Conquest ever did.
Nay, he in a moment frankly bestowed upon us more than ever he
desires he shall be trusted with again; for by his Act of Indempnity
he bestowed upon his Subjects their Lives, Liberties and Estates
which were all justly and legally forfeited to him by the late Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
the consideration whereof will prevent all fears and jealousies,
and promote in all Loyal hearts a firm resolution to sacrifice their
Lives and Fortunes, so freely bestowed upon us by him, to maintain
the Crown and just Prerogatives thereof, so that it may have a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
continuance in that Royal Family in a lawful Succession, which
I heartily pray may be so long as the Sun and Moon endures.</p>
            <p>From what hath been said, I hope it doth plainly appear, that since
the Law of this Land and the Law of Nature and Nations, allow the
Power of making Companies to manage Traffick, exclusive to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to be in the Prince; That this is reckoned to be <hi>inter Jura re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galia;</hi>
That no Act of Parliament does restrain this Prerogative; That
the practice of all <hi>Europe</hi> has been accordingly; That particularly such
Companies have been erected in <hi>England,</hi> and those Companies have
been in quiet <hi>possession</hi> of their Priviledges, for such a number of
years; That they have passed the approbation of so many learned
Men; That they have been thought for the publick advantage of the
Nation, by so many Kings and Princes, with the advice of their Council
both in and out of Parliament; That all Statutes and Authorities of
Law that we can meet with in our Books affirm it, and none that I
can meet with oppose it.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>East-India</hi> Company have solely run the hazard, and been
at great Expences;


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55333:18"/>
               <q>
                  <l>In discovering Places,</l>
                  <l>Erecting Forts, and keeping Forces,</l>
                  <l>Setling Factories,</l>
                  <l>And making Leagues and Treaties abroad,</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It would be against natural Justice and Equity (which no Munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Law can take away) for others to reap the benefit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of all this.</p>
            <p>Especially since all this has been occasioned by an Act of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and by the just Prerogative of the Crown under which they
claim.</p>
            <p>So that now supposing the matter had been doubtful at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
(as yet the contrary is evident) yet after so many years undispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and uniterrupted Prerogative of the King, and the possession of
the Companies pursuant thereunto; and yet the Laws having always
been open to any Subjects who conceive themselves grieved, that
Speech which <hi>Josephus</hi> records of King <hi>Agrippa</hi> to those <hi>Jews,</hi> who
after many years endeavoured to recover their lost pretence, may be
applied to these clamorous Interlopers.</p>
            <p>Intempestivum est nunc libertatem concupiscere, olim ne amitteretur
certatum oportuit. Non amantes libertatis dicendi estis, sed subditi
contumaces.</p>
            <p>And so the <hi>Romans</hi> answered <hi>Antiochus</hi> (to shew the injustice of
his Demands) That he required those Cities which his Precessor
for so many years had never enjoyed.</p>
            <p>And Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> pleaded against the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> for the
rights of Fishing upon the coasts of <hi>Norway</hi> and <hi>New-Island,</hi> That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Great Grandfather, Grandfather nor Father, had exacted any
thing for it, and therefore concluded it to be unjust.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cambden Eliz, sub</hi> Anno 1600.</p>
            <p>So that I conclude the First, and as I conceive the onely Point in
this Case, that Letters Patents that give Licence and Liberty to the
Plaintiffs to exercise the sole Trade to the <hi>Indies</hi> within the limits of
their Grant, exclusive of all others, is a good Grant in Law.</p>
            <p>II. I do conceive that the Defendant trading to the <hi>Indies</hi> contrary
to this Charter, may be punished by Information at the Suit of the
King, and that this Action by the Plaintiffs is also well brought; but
in as much as I have detained you so long upon the first Point, I shall
trespass upon your patience but a few words to this.</p>
            <p>I. Therefore, I conceive the Plaintiff need not alledg any special
Damage, no more than the Grantee of a Fair, Market, or any other
Franchise.</p>
            <p>II. The Action is brought, and grounded upon the Grant of the
sole and intire Trade, which, as I conceive is a Franchise the King
may grant, and is like the Case of New Inventions, upon which Letters
Patents, Actions are brought by every days experience, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting
Clause is added onely to make the thing more notorious; and
that Interlopers in case they should be prosecuted at the King's Suit,
should be more inexcusable, and until you can imagine there may be
as many <hi>East-India</hi> Companies as there are Commoners and School-Masters
in <hi>England, Mary</hi>'s Case, <hi>Cook</hi> 9. can never be thought an
Objection. As to the Objection in the 11 <hi>Rep. 88. Rolls</hi> Abridgment,


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55333:19"/>
part. 106. <hi>Darcy</hi>'s Case, that admitting the Grant or Disponsation to
<hi>Darcy</hi> had been good for the sole importing of Forein Cards: yet that
being onely a Dispensation to the Stat. of E. 4. and did only exclude
<hi>Darcy</hi> from the penalty of that Act, he could not maintian the Action;
but if in case that Grant had vested an Interest, as our Grant at the Bar
does, he might have brought an Action, as my Lord <hi>Rolls</hi> says in the
next Paragraph, may be collected out of <hi>Darcy</hi>'s Case.</p>
            <p>The Case upon Patents of new Inventions are full Authorities in
the Case at the Bar; and so is that Case of the Abbot of <hi>Westminster,
Re.</hi> fol. 107. Wherein upon the Grant of the Market for thirty days,
exclusive of others, is particularly set forth in the Action; and the
<hi>Salisbury</hi> man that brought <hi>Cloth</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> and sold the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to that Charter, is prosecuted in an Action of Trespass upon
the Case, at the Suit of the Abbot, and the Writ concludes (suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Grant good) <hi>in nostri contemptum &amp; praedicti Abbatis grave
damnum ac Fr. &amp; libertatum suarum praedictarum laesionem manifestam,</hi>
which is an Authority full as to this Point.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter I am of the same Opinion with my Brothers,
and do conceive that that Grant to the Plaintiffs of the Sole Trade to
the <hi>Indies,</hi> exclusive of others, is a good Grant, and that the Action
is well brought: and therefore let the Plaintiff take his Judgment.</p>
