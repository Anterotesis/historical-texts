            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough in publiſhing our Writings, we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them for the good of all; yet cuſtom (not without reaſon) doth teach us, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to direct them more eſpecially to ſome. Though one only had the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal intereſt in theſe papers, yet do I now direct them to you all, as not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how in this to ſeparate you. You dwell together in my Eſtimation and Affection: One of you a Member of
<pb facs="tcp:57538:4"/>
the Church, which I muſt Teach; and legally the Patron of its Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Miniſter: The other, a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial branch of that family, which I was firſt indebted to in this County. You lately joyned in preſenting to the Parliament, the Petition of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the Goſpel and a faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry: When I only told you of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, of ſending ſome poor Scholars to the Univerſity, you freely and joyntly offered your conſiderable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual allowance thereto, and that for the continuance of my life, or their neceſſities there. I will tell the world of this, whether you will or no: not for your applauſe, but for their imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and the ſhame of many of far greater eſtates, that will not be drawn to do the like. The ſeaſon ſomewhat aggravates the Goodneſs of your Works. When Satan hath a deſign to burn up thoſe Nurſeries, you are watering Gods plants: when the greedy mouth of Sacriledge is gaping for their Maintenance, you are voluntarily add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:57538:4"/>
for the ſupply of its defect. Who knows how many ſouls they may win to Chriſt (if God ſhall ſend them forth into his harveſt) whom you have thus aſſiſted? and what an addition to your comfort this may be? When the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is ſo undermined, and the Miniſtry ſo maligned, and their maintenance ſo envied, you have, as the mouth of this County, appeared for them all. What God will yet do with us, we cannot tell; but if he will continue his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to us, you may have the greater comfort in it; If he will remove it, and forſake a proud unworthy falſe hearted People; yet may you have the comfort of your ſincere endeavors: you (with the reſt that ſincerely fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered it) may eſcape the gnawings of Conſcience, and the publique curſe and reproach, which the Hiſtorie of this age may faſten upon them, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all their Engagements in blood and Covenants, would either in ignorant fury, or malicious ſubtilty, or baſe temporizing cowardize, oppugn or
<pb facs="tcp:57538:5"/>
undermine the Goſpel, or in perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious ſilence, look on, whilſt its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. But becauſe it is not the work of a flatterer, that I am doing, but of a friend; I muſt ſecond theſe commendations with ſome caution and counſel; and tell your ſelves of your danger and duty, as I tell others of your exemplary Deeds. Truly the ſad experiences of theſe times, have much abaſed my confidence in man, and cauſed me to have lower thoughts of the beſt, then ſometime I have had. I confeſs I look on man, as ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered, ſlippery and unconſtant thing, and of ſuch a natural muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Apprehenſions and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that as I ſhall never more call any man on earth, My friend, but with a ſuppoſition that he may poſſibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come mine enemie; So I ſhall never be ſo confident of any mans Fidelity to Chriſt, as not withal to ſuſpect that he may poſſibly forſake him: nor ſhall I boaſt of any mans ſervice for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, but with a jealouſie that he may
<pb facs="tcp:57538:5"/>
be drawn to do as much againſt it (though God who knows the heart, and knows his own decrees, may know his ſincerity, and foreknow his perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.) Let me therefore remember you, that had you expended your whole eſtates, and the blood of your hearts for Chriſt and his Goſpel, he will not take himſelf beholden to you. He oweth you no Thanks for your deepeſt engagements, higheſt adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, greateſt coſt, or utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. You are ſure beforehand that you ſhall be no loſers by him: your ſeeming hazards increaſe your ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Your loſſes are your gain; your giving is your receiving; your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences are your revenues: Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns the largeſt uſury. The more you do and ſuffer for him, the more you are beholden to him. I muſt alſo remember you, that you may poſſibly live to ſee the day, when it will coſt you dearer to ſhew your ſelves faithful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:57538:6"/>
that many have ſhrunk in greater tryals, that paſt through leſſer with reſolution and honor. Your defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the laſt, would be the loſs of all your works and hopes. <hi>If any man draw back,</hi> Chriſt ſaith, <hi>his ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi> Even thoſe that have endured the great fight of Affliction, being reproached and made a gazing-ſtock, and that have taken joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods, in aſſurance of a better and enduring ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, have yet need to be warned that they caſt not away their confidence, and draw not back to perdition, and loſe not the Reward for want of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Perſeverance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. to the end. That you may eſcape this danger, and be happy for ever, take this advice. 1. Look carefully to the ſincerity of your hearts, in their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-cloſure with Chriſt.

too highly any thing below. Be jealous, and very jealous, leſt your hearts ſhould cloſe deceitfully with Chriſt, maintaining any ſecret Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve for your bodily ſafety: either reſolving not to follow him, or not reſolving to follow him through the moſt deſolate diſtreſſed condition that he ſhall lead you in. Count what it may coſt you to get the Crown; ſtudy well his precepts of Mortification and Self-denyal. There is no true hopes of the Glory to come, if you cannot caſt overboard all worldly hopes, when the ſtorm is ſuch that you muſt hazard the one. O how many have thought that Chriſt was moſt dear to them, and that the hopes of heaven were their chiefeſt hopes, who have left Chriſt, though with ſorrow, when he bid them let go all? 2. Every day renew your apprehenſions of the Truth and Worth of the Promiſed Felicity; and of the Deluſory Vanity of all things here below: Let not Heaven loſe with you its Attractive force, through your
<pb facs="tcp:57538:7"/>
forgetfulneſs or unbelief. He is the beſt Chriſtian, that knows beſt why he is a Chriſtian; and he will moſt faithfully ſeek and ſuffer, that beſt knows for what he doth it. Value not Wealth and Honor above that rate which the wiſeſt and beſt experienced have put upon them: and allow them no more of your affections then they deſerve. A mean wit may eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their emptineſs. Look on all preſent actions and conditions with a remembrance of their end. Deſire not a ſhare in their proſperity, who muſt pay as dear for it as the loſs of their ſouls: Be not ambitious of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor which muſt end in Confuſion; nor of the Favor of thoſe that God will call enemies. How ſpeedily will they come down, and be levelled in the duſt, and be laid in the chains of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that now ſeem ſo happy to the pur-blinde world, that cannot ſee the things to come? Fear not that man that muſt ſhortly tremble before that God whom all muſt fear. 3. Be more
<pb facs="tcp:57538:7"/>
ſolicitous for the ſecuring of your Conſciences and Salvation, then of your honors or eſtates: In every thing that you are put upon, conſult firſt with God and Conſcience; and not with fleſh and blood. It is your daily and moſt ſerious care and watchfulneſs that is requiſite to maintain your inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity; and not a few careleſs thoughts or purpoſes, conjunct with a minding of earthly things. 4 Deal faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with every truth which you receive. Take heed of ſubjecting it to carnal intereſts: If once you have affections that can maſter your Underſtandings, you are loſt, and know it not. For when you have a Reſolution to caſt off any d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty, you will firſt Believe it is no duty: and when you muſt change your judgement for carnal advantages, you will make the change ſeem reaſonable and right: and evil ſhall be proved good when you have a minde to follow it. 5. Make Goſpel-Truths your own, by daily humble ſtudies, ariſing to ſuch a ſoundneſs of Judgement, that
<pb facs="tcp:57538:8"/>
you may not need to take too much upon truſt; leſt if your guides ſhould miſcarry, you miſcarry with them. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver not up your underſtanding in Captivity to any. 6. Yet do not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value your own Underſtandings. This Pride hath done that in Church and State, which all diſcerning men are la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting. They that know but little, ſee not what they want, as well as what they have; nor that imperfection in their knowledge which ſhould humble them, nor that difficulty in things, which ſhould make them diligent and modeſt. 7. Apprehend the neceſſity and Uſefulneſs of Chriſts Officers, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Ordinances for the proſperity of his Church: Paſtors muſt guide you, though not ſeduce you, or lead you blindefold. But chooſe (if you may) ſuch as are judicious, and not ignorant, not raſh but ſober, not formal but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and ſpiritual, not of carnal but heavenly converſations; eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void them that divide and follow par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Quarrel more with your own unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unworthineſs in Ordinances, then with other mens. It is the frame of your own heart that doth more to help or hinder your Comforts, then the quality of thoſe you joyn with. To theſe few Directions added to the reſt in this Book, I ſhall ſubjoyn my hearty Prayers, that you may receive from that Goſpel and Miniſtry which you have owned, ſuch ſtability in the faith, ſuch victory over the fleſh and the world, ſuch apprehenſions of the Love of God in Chriſt, ſuch directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in every ſtrait and duty, that you

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y dearly Beloved Fellow-Chriſtians, whoſe ſouls are taken up with the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thoughts of attaining and maintaining Peace with God: who are vile in your own eyes, and value the Blood and Spirit and Word of your Redeemer, and the Hope of the Saints in their approaching Bleſſedneſs, before all the Pomp and Vanities of this world, and Reſolve to give up your ſelves to his Conduct, who is become the Author of Eternal Salvation to all them that obey him: For You do I Publiſh theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Directions: and to You it is that I direct this Preface. The onely Glorious and Infinite God, who made the Worlds,
<pb facs="tcp:57538:10"/>
and upholdeth them by his Word, who is attended with Millions of his Glorious Angels, and Praiſed continually by his Heavenly hoſts: who pulleth down the Mighty from their ſeats, and ſcattereth the Proud in the Imaginations of their hearts, and maketh his Enemies lick the duſt: to whom the Kings and Conquerors of the Earth are as the ſillieſt worms, and the whole world is Nothing, and lighter then Vanity, which he will ſhortly turn into flames before your eyes: This God hath ſent me to you, with that Joyful Meſſage, which needs no more but your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving entertainment, to make it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to raiſe you from the duſt, and baniſh thoſe terrours and troubles from your hearts, and help you to live like the Sons of God. He commandeth me to tell you, that he takes notice of your ſorrows: he ſtands by when you ſee him not and ſay He hath forſaken you: he minds you with greateſt tenderneſs when you ſay He hath forgotten you: He numbreth your ſighs: he bottles up your tears: the groans of your hearts do reach his own. He takes
<pb facs="tcp:57538:10"/>
it unkindly, that you are ſo ſuſpicious of him: and that all that he hath done for you in the work of Redemption, and all the gracious workings of his Spirit on your ſouls, and all your own peculiar experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Goodneſs, can raiſe you to no higher apprehenſions of his Love! Shall not Love be acknowledged to be Love, when its grown to a Miracle? when it ſurpaſſeth Comprehenſion! Muſt the Lord ſet up Love and Mercy in the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, to be equally admired with his Omnipotency manifeſted in the Creation? and call forth the World to this ſweet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, that in Secret and in Publick it might be the buſineſs of our lives? and yet ſhall it be ſo overlookt or queſtioned, as if you lived without Love and Mercy in the World? Providence doth its part, by heaping up Mountains of daily Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and theſe it ſets before your eyes: The Goſpel hath eminently done its part by clear deſcribing them, and fully aſſuring them: and this is proclaimed frequently in your ears: And yet is there ſo little in your hearts and mouths? Do you ſee,
<pb facs="tcp:57538:11"/>
and hear, and feel, and taſte Mercy and Love? do you Live wholly on it? and yet do you ſtill doubt of it? and think ſo meanly of it, and ſo hardly acknowledge it? God takes not this well: but yet he conſidereth your frailty, and takes you not at the worſt. He knows that fleſh will play its part, and the Remnants of Corruption will not be idle: and the Serpent will be ſuggeſting falſe thoughts of God, and will be ſtill ſtriving moſt to obſcure that part of his Glory which is deareſt to him, and eſpecially which is moſt conjoyned with the Happineſs of Man. He knows alſo, that ſin will breed ſorrows and fears: and that mans Underſtanding is ſhallow, and all his Conceivings of God are exceeding low: and that we are ſo far from God as Creatures, and ſo much further as ſinners, and eſpecially as Conſcious of the abuſe of his Grace, that there muſt needs follow ſuch a ſtrangeneſs, as will damp and dull our apprehenſions of his Love: and ſuch an abatement of our Confidence, as will make us draw back, and look at God afar off. Seeing therefore that at this diſtance
<pb facs="tcp:57538:11"/>
no full apprehenſions of Love can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected: It is the Pleaſure of our Redeemer ſhortly to Return, with ten thouſands of his Saints, with the noble Army of his Martyrs, and the attendance of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: and to give you ſuch a Convincing Demonſtration of his Love, as ſhall leave no room for one more Doubt. Your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts are now but a Taſt, they ſhall be then a Feaſt: They are now but Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent, they ſhall be then Continual<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How ſoon now do your Conquered fears re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn? and what an unconſtancy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evenneſs is there in our Peace? But then our Peace muſt needs be Perfect and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent, when we ſhall pleaſe God and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him in Perfection to Perpetuity. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, Chriſtians, your Comforts ſhould be now more abundant, but that they are not ripe: It is that, and not this, that is your harveſt: I have told you in another Book the miſtake and danger of expecting too much here, and the Neceſsity of Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Longing for that Reſt, if we will have Peace indeed! But, alas, how hard is this leſſon learned? Unbelievers would
<pb facs="tcp:57538:12"/>
have Happineſs: but how fain would they have it in the Creature, rather then in God! Believers would rather have their Happineſs in God then in the Creature: But how fain would they have it without Dying? And no wonder: for when Sin brought in Death, even Grace it ſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Love it, though it may ſubmit to it: But though Churliſh Death do ſtand in our way, why look we not at the Souls admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance into Reſt! and the Bodies Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection that muſt ſhortly follow? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs that Faith by which we are Juſtified and Saved, as it ſits down on the word of Truth as the preſent ground of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident repoſe, ſo doth it thence look with one eye backward on the Croſs, and with the other forward on the Crown: And if we well obſerve the Scripture Deſcriptions of that Faith, we ſhall find them as frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly magnifying it, and deſcribing it from the latter as from the former. As it is the duty and glory of faith to look back with Thankful Acknowledgement to a Crucified Chriſt, and his payment of our Ranſome: ſo is it the Duty and Glory of
<pb facs="tcp:57538:12"/>
that ſame Juſtifying Saving Faith to Look forward with Deſire and Hope to the Return of King Jeſus, and the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Celebration of the Marriage of the Lamb, and the Sentencial Juſtification, and the Glorification of his Saints: To Believe theſe things unfeignedly which we never ſaw, (nor ever ſpoke with man that did ſee) and to Hope for them ſo Really as to let go all preſent forbidden pleaſures, and all worldly hopes and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happineſs, rather then to hazard the loſs of them: this is an eminent part of that Faith by which the Juſt do live, and which the Scripture doth own as Juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Saving: (For it never diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth between Juſtifying Faith and Saving Faith, as to their nature.) It is therefore a great miſtake of ſome to look onely at that one eye of Juſtifying Faith which looks back upon the Croſs, and a great miſtake of them on the other hand that look onely at that eye of it which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the Crown: Both Chriſt Crucified, and Chriſt Interceding, and Chriſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to Juſtifie and Glorifie, are the
<pb facs="tcp:57538:13"/>
objects even of Juſtifying Saving Faith, moſt ſtrictly ſo called. The Scripture oft expreſſeth the one onely: but then it ſtill implyeth the other. The Socinians erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly therefore from <hi>Heb. 11.</hi> (where the Examples and Elogies of Faith are ſet forth) do exclude Chriſt Crucified, or the reſpect to his Satisfaction, from Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith, and place it in a meer Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of Glory: and others do as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groundedly affirm, that it is not the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Act of Faith which <hi>Heb. 11.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth, becauſe they find not the Croſs of Chriſt there mentioned. For as Believing in Chriſts Blood Comprehendeth the End, even the Expectation of Remiſsion and Glory merited by that blood: ſo the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving of that Glory doth always imply that we Believe and Expect it as the fruit of Chriſts Ranſome. It is for health and life that we Accept and Truſt upon our Phyſician: And it is for Juſtification and Salvation that we Accept and Truſt on Chriſt. The Salvation of our Souls is the End of our Faith. They that queſtion whether we may Believe and Obey for our
<pb facs="tcp:57538:13"/>
own Salvation, do queſtion whether we may go to the Phyſician, and follow his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for Health and Life. Why then do you that are Believers, ſo much forget the End of your Faith? and that for which it is that you Believe? Believing in Chriſt for preſent Mercies onely, be they temporal or ſpiritual, is not the true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving. They are dangerouſly miſtaken that think the thoughts of Heaven to be ſo accidental to the nature and work of Faith, as that they tend onely to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and are not neceſſary to Salvation it ſelf. It is upon your apprehenſions and expectations of that unſeen felicity that both your Peace and Safety do depend. How contrary therefore is it to the nature of a Believer, to forget the Place of his Reſt and Conſolation! and to Look for ſo much of theſe from Creatures, in this our preſent Pilgrimage and Priſon, as, alas, too commonly we do! Thus do we kill our Comforts, and then complain for want of them. How ſhould you have any Life or Conſtancy of Conſolations, that are ſo ſeldom, ſo ſlight, ſo unbelieving and
<pb facs="tcp:57538:14"/>
ſo heartleſs in your thoughts of Heaven! You know what a folly it is to expect any Peace, which ſhall not come from Chriſt as the Fountain: And you muſt learn as well to underſtand what a folly it is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any ſolid Joys, or ſtable Peace, which is not fetcht from Heaven, as from the End. O that Chriſtians were careful to live with one eye ſtill on Chriſt Crucified, and with the other on Chriſt coming in Glory! If the Everlaſting Joys were more in your believing thoughts, Spiritual Joys would more abound at preſent in your hearts. It's no more wonder that you are Comfortleſs when Heaven is forgotten, or doubtingly remembred, then that you are faint when you eat not, or cold when you ſtir not, or when you have not fire or clothes.</p>
            <p>But when Chriſtians do not onely let fall their expectations of the things Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, but alſo heighten their expectations from the Creature: then do they moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly prepare for their fears, and troubles, and eſtrangedneſs from God, and with both hands draw calamities on their
<pb facs="tcp:57538:14"/>
ſouls. Who ever meets with a diſtreſſed complaining ſoul, where one or both of theſe is not apparent? their Low expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from God hereafter, or their high expectations from the Creature now? What doth keep us under ſuch trouble and diſquietneſs, but that we will not Expect what God hath Promiſed, or we will needs Expect what he Promiſed not? And then we complain when we miſs of thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations which we fooliſhly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groundedly raiſed to our ſelves! We are grieved for Croſſes, for Loſſes, for wrongs from our Enemies, for unkind or unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful dealings of our Friends, for ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for contempt and diſ-eſteem in the World! But who bid you look for any better? Was it Proſperity, and Riches, and Credit, and Friends, that God called you to Believe for? or that you became Chriſtians for, or that you had an abſolute promiſe of in the Word? If you will make Promiſes to your ſelf, and then your own Promiſes deceive you, whom ſhould you blame for that? Nay do we not, as it were, necessitate God hereby, to embitter
<pb facs="tcp:57538:15"/>
all our Comforts below, and to make every Creature as a Scorpion to us, becauſe we will needs make them our petty Deities? We have leſs Comfort in them then elſe we might have, becauſe we muſt needs have more then we ſhould have. You might have more faithfulneſs from your Friends, more Reputation in the World, more ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in all your preſent enjoyments, if you lookt for Leſs. Why is it that you can ſcarce name a Creature near you, that is not a ſcourge to you, but becauſe you can ſcarce name one that is not your Idol? or, at leaſt, which you do not expect more from, then you ought? Nay (which is one of the ſaddeſt Conſiderations of this kind that can be imagined) God is fain to ſcourge us moſt even by the higheſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Religion, becauſe we have moſt Idolized them, and had ſuch exceſsive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But a believing eye can diſcern the reaſon of this ſad providence (in part:) Never men were more Idolized: and therefore no wonder if we were never ſo afflicted by any. Alas, when will we learn by Scripture and Providence ſo to know God and the Creature, as to look for More from him, and leſs from them! We have looked for Wonders from <hi>Scotland,</hi> and what is come of it? We looked that War ſhould have even ſatisfied our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and when it had removed all viſible Impediments, we thought we ſhould have had ſuch a glorious Reformation as the World never knew! And now behold, a Babel, and a mangled Deformation! What high Expectations had we from an Aſſembly! what Expectations from a Parliament! and where are they now! O hear the Word of the Lord, ye low-ſpirited People! [Ceaſe ye from man, whoſe breath is in his noſtrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of? <hi>Iſa. 2.22.</hi>] [Curſed be the man that truſteth in man,
<pb facs="tcp:57538:16"/>
and maketh fleſh his arm, and whoſe heart departeth from the Lord: For he ſhall be like the Heath in the Deſart, and ſhall not ſee when Good cometh. Bleſſed is the man that truſteth in the Lord, and whoſe Hope the Lord is: For he ſhall be as a Tree planted by the Waters, &amp;c. <hi>Jer. 17.5, 6, 7, 8.</hi>] [Surely men of Low degree are Vanity, and men of High degree are a Lye: to be laid in the ballance they are altogether lighter then Vanity, <hi>Pſal. 62.9.</hi>] Let me warn you all, Chriſtians, for the time to come, Take the Creature as a Creature: remember its frailty: look for no more from it then its part: If you have the neareſt, deareſt, godly friends, expect to feel the ſting of their Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as well as to taſt the ſweetneſs of their Grace: And they muſt expect the like from you.</p>
            <p>If you ask me why I ſpeak ſo much of theſe things here? It is, <hi>1.</hi> Becauſe I find that much of the trouble of ordinary Chriſtians comes from their Croſſes in the Creature, and the fruſtration of theſe their ſinful Expectations. <hi>2.</hi> And becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:57538:16"/>
I have ſaid ſo little of it in the following Directions, they being intended for the cure of another kind of Trouble: therefore I have ſaid this much here of this.</p>
            <p>Having premiſed this advice, I take my ſelf bound to adde one thing more: that is, An Apologie for the Publication of this Imperfect Piece: whether juſt or inſufficient, other men muſt judge.

<pb facs="tcp:57538:17"/>
not be made partakers of them? And how come I to go on in the ſame fault my ſelf? Truly I have no Excuſe or Argument but thoſe of the Times, <hi>Neceſſity and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi>: which how far they may Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie me, I muſt leave to the Judge. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in company with a troubled complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Friend, I perceived that it muſt be ſome ſtanding Counſel which might be frequently peruſed, that muſt ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily anſwer the Complaints that I heard, and not a tranſient Speech, which would quickly ſlip away: Being therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged as a Paſtor, and as a Friend, and as a Chriſtian, to tender my beſt aſsiſtance for relief, I was ſuddenly (in the moment of ſpeaking) moved to promiſe one ſheet of Paper, which might be uſeful to that End. Which promiſe when I attempted to perform, the one ſheet lengthened to thirty, and my one daies (intended) work was drawn out to a juſt month, I went on far before I had the leaſt thought to let any eye behold it, except the Party for whom I wrote it: But at laſt I perceived an impoſsibility of contracting, and I was
<pb facs="tcp:57538:17"/>
preſently poſſeſſed with confident appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, that a Copy of thoſe Directions might be uſeful to many other of my poor Neighbours and Friends that needed them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s much: Upon which apprehenſion I preſently permitted my Pen to run more at large, and to deviate from the caſe of the Party that I wrote for: and to take in the common caſe of moſt troubled doubting ſouls. By that time I had finiſhed it, I received Letters from ſeveral parts, from Learned and Judicious Divines, importuning me to print more (having underſtood my Intentions to deſiſt, as having done too much already, even at firſt:) I confeſs I was not much moved by their Importunity, till they ſeconded it with their Arguments: whereof one was, The Experience of the ſucceſs of former Writings, which might aſſure me it was not diſpleaſing to God. I had many that urged me: I had no one but my ſelf to draw me back. I apprehended that a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this nature might be uſeful to the many weak perplexed Chriſtians through the Land. Two reaſons did at firſt come
<pb facs="tcp:57538:18"/>
in againſt it. The firſt was, That if there were no more written on this Subject then Doctor <hi>Sibs</hi>'s Bruiſed Reed, and Souls Conflict, and Mr <hi>Joſ. Symonds</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted Souls Caſe and Cure, there need no more: Eſpecially there being alſo Doctor <hi>Preſtons</hi> Works, and many of <hi>Perkins,</hi> to this uſe: and Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwel</hi> of Faith, and divers the like. To this my own Judgement anſwered, That yet theſe brief <hi>Directions</hi> might adde ſomewhat that might be uſeful to the weak, as to the <hi>Method</hi> of their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, if not to the matter: And my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſtopt my mouth by telling me, that others had written before me of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm</hi>: and yet my labours were not loſt. Next this, I thought the Crudity and weakneſs of the Writing was ſuch, as ſhould prohibit the publication, it being unfit to thruſt upon the World, the haſty undigeſted lines that were written for the uſe of one perſon. To this my thoughts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, That <hi>1.</hi> For all that, it might be uſeful to poor Women, and Country people, who moſt commonly prove the troubled
<pb facs="tcp:57538:18"/>
ſpirits for whoſe ſakes I wrote it. Had I writ for the uſe of Learned men, I would have tried to make it fitter for their uſe: and if I could not, I would have ſuppreſſed it. <hi>2.</hi> It was my Pride that nouriſhed this ſcruple, which moved me not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo homely to the World, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I caſt it by. One thing more I confeſs did much prevail with me to make theſe Papers publick: and that is, the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians common, confident obtruſion of their Anti-Evangelical doctrines and methods for comforting troubled ſouls. They are the moſt notorious Mountebanks in this Art, the higheſt pretenders, and unhappieſt performers, that moſt of the Reformed Churches ever knew. And none uſually are readier to receive their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, then ſuch weak women or unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful people, that being in Trouble, are like a ſick man in great pain, who is glad to hear what all can ſay, and to make trial of every thing by which he hath any hope of eaſe. And then there is ſo much Opium in theſe Mountebanks Nepenthes, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote of Reſt: ſo many principles of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

ſecurity and preſumption, which tend to the preſent caſe of the Patient, (whatever follow) that it is no wonder if ſome well-meaning Chriſtians do quickly ſwallow the bait, and proclaim the rare effects of this Medicament, and the admirable skil of this unskilful Sect, to the enſnaring of others, eſpecially that are in the like diſtreſs. Eſpecially when they meet with ſome Divines of our own, who do deliver to them ſome Maſter-points of this Syſteme of Miſtakes, which are ſo neceſſarily concatenated to the reſt, that they may eaſily ſee, if they have one, they muſt have all, unleſs they will hold Contradictions. As to inſtance in the Doctrine of Juſtification before Faith: or the diſſolving the Obligation to Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (which is nothing but Remiſsion of ſin) before Faith: So that nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ſince Chriſts death (as ſome) or ſince Gods Decree (as others) but onely to have our Pardon manifeſted, or to be Juſtified in Conſcience, or (as ſome phraſe it) to have that Juſtification which is terminated in Conſcience.

            <p>I had not troubled the Reader with this Apologie, had I thought ſo well of this Writing as to be a ſufficient Apologie for it ſelf: or had I not taken it for a hainous Crime to ſpeak Idly in Print.</p>
            <p>For the Doctrine here contained, it is of a Middle ſtrain, between (I think) the Extreams of ſome others. I have labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo to build up Peace, as not thereby to fortifie Preſumption. And perhaps in ſome Points you may ſee my meaning more plainly, which through the obſcurity of former Writings I was miſ-underſtood in.

the want and worth of Mercy, that Chriſt and his Conſolations may not ſeem contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible in their eyes. It is none of my buſineſs now, to give any advice for the furthering of this Conviction or Humiliation. But the Caſe in hand is; <hi>How a Sinner may attain to a ſetled Peace of Conſcience, and ſome compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent meaſure of the Joy of the holy Ghoſt, who hath been convinced of Sin and Miſery, and long made a Profeſſion of Holineſs, but liveth in continuall doubtings of their ſincerity, and fears of Gods wrath, becauſe of an exceeding Deadneſs of ſpirit, and a want of that Love to God, and Delight in him, and ſweetneſs in Duty, and witneſs of the Spirit, and Communion with God, and other the like Evidences which are found in the Saints.</hi> How far the party is right or wrong in the Diſcovery of theſe Wants, I now meddle not. Whether they Judge rightly or wrongly the Directions may be Uſefull to them. And though I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely meddle not with the unhumbled that feel not the want of Chriſt and Mercy, yet moſt that falls may be uſefull to all that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the Chriſtian faith.

                  </gap>enſe of our own Infirmities: ſometimes it is only from ordinary Infirmities: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from ſome extraordinary decayes of inward Grace: ſometime from the neglects
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57538:32"/>
of ſome weighty duty: and ſometimes from the deep wounds of ſome heynous ſecret, or ſcandalous ſin: And ſometimes it is meerly from the freſh diſcovery of that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we never did diſcern: And ſometimes from the violent aſſault of extraordinary Temptations: which of theſe is your own Caſe, you muſt be carefull to finde out, and to apply the means for Cure accordingly. Even of true Chriſtians, the ſame means will not fit all. The difference of Natures as well as of actuall Caſes muſt be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. One hath need of that tender handling which would undo another: and he again hath need of that rowſing which another cannot bear. And therefore underſtand that when I have given you all the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that I can, I muſt (in the end hereof) adviſe you to take the Counſel of a skilfull Miniſter in applying and making uſe of them: For it is in this, as in the Caſe of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick: When we have written the beſt Books of Receipts, or for Methodicall Cures, yet we muſt adviſe people to take heed how they uſe them without the advice of a learned and faithfull Phyſitian. For Medicines muſt not be only fitted to Diſeaſes but to Bodies. That Medicine will kill one man, which will cure another of the ſame diſtemper: ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there may be in their age, ſtrength,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57538:33"/>
complexion and other things. So is it much in our preſent Caſe. And therefore as when all the Phyſick Books in the world are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and all Receipts known, yet will there be ſtill a Neceſſity of Phyſitians; ſo when all Diſcoveries and Directions are made in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, there will ſtill be a Neceſſity of a conſtant ſtanding Miniſtry. And as ignorant Women and Emprikes do kill oft times more then they Cure, though they have the beſt Receipts, for want of Judgment and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience to uſe them aright: ſo do ignorant Teachers and Guides by mens ſouls, though they can ſay the ſame words as a Judicious Paſtor, and repeat the ſame Texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. Not that I mean, that ſuch can do no good: Yes, much no doubt, if they will hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, compaſſionately and faithfully improve their Talents, within the verge of their own Calling: which if they go beyond, ordinarily a remarkable Judgment followeth their beſt labours; both to the Churches and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſouls that make uſe of them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore becauſe (if my conjectural progniſticks fail not, as I daily pray they may) we are like to be more tried and plagued this way, then ever were any of our fore-fathers ſince <hi>Adams</hi> dayes till now, and ſeeing this is the hour of our Temptation, wherein God is purpoſely ſeparating the chaff, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering

to the world, the dangers of injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious miſguided Zeal; I ſhall therefore both firſt and laſt adviſe you, as ever you would have a ſetled Peace of Conſcience, keep out of the hand of vagrant and ſeducing Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebanks, under what Names, or Titles, or pretences ſoever they may aſſault you. Eſpecially ſuſpect all that beſtow as much pains to win you to their party, as to win you to Chriſt.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p n="2">2. Make as full a Diſcovery as you can, how much of the trouble of your minde doth ariſe from your Melancholy, and bodily diſtempers, and how much from diſcontenting afflictions in your worldly Eſtate, or Friends, or Name. And according to your Diſcovery make uſe of the Remedy.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Put theſe two Cauſes of trouble here to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the beginning, becauſe I will preſently diſmiſs them, and apply the reſt of theſe Directions only to thoſe Troubles that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57538:34"/>
are raiſed from ſins and wants in Grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For Melancholy, I have by long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience found it to have ſo great and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon a hand in the fears and troubles of minde, that I meet not with one of many that live in great Troubles and fears for any long time together, but Melancholy is the main ſeat of them: Though they feel nothing in their body, but all in their Minde. I would have ſuch perſons make uſe of ſome able godly Phiſitian, and he will help them to diſcern how much of their Trouble comes from Melancholy. Where this is the Cauſe, uſually the party is Fearfull of almoſt every thing: a word, or a ſudden thought will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet them: Sometime they are ſad and ſcarce know why: all Comforts are of no continuance with them: but as ſoon as you have done comforting them, &amp; they be never ſo well ſatisfied, yet the trouble returns in a few dayes or hours, as ſoon as the dark and troubled ſpirits return to their former force: They are ſtill addicted to muſing and ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs, and thoughts will run in their mindes, that they cannot lay them by: If it go any thing farre; they are almoſt alwayes aſſaulted with Temptations to Blaſphemy, to doubt whether there be a God, or a Chriſt, or the Scriptures be true; or whether there be a Heaven or a Hell: and oft tempted to ſpeak
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57538:34"/>
ſome blaſphemous words againſt God; and this with ſuch importunity that they can hardly forbear: and oft times they are tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to make away themſelves. When it goes ſo farre, they are next to the loſs of the uſe of reaſon, if it be not prevented.</p>
               <p>Now to thoſe that finde that Melancholy is the Cauſe of their Troubles I would give this advice. 1. Expect not that Rational, Spiritual Remedies ſhould ſuffice for this Cure: For you may as well expect that a good Sermon or comfortable words ſhould cure the falling Sickneſs, or Palſie, or a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken head, as to be a ſufficient Cure to your Melancholy fears. For this is as reall a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily diſeaſe as the other: Only becauſe it works on the ſpirits and phantaſie, on which words of advice do alſo work, therefore ſuch words, and Scripture, and Reaſon, may ſomewhat reſiſt it, and may palliate or allay ſome of the effects at the preſent: but as ſoon as time hath worn off the force and effects of theſe Reaſons, the diſtemper preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns.</p>
               <p>For the Humour hath the advantage 1. Of continuall preſence, 2. Of a more neceſſary, naturall and ſenſible way of working. As if a man be in an eaſie Lethargy; you may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake him ſo long as you are calling on him aloud, but as ſoon as you ceaſe, he is aſleep
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57538:35"/>
again: Such is the caſe of the Melancholy in their ſorrows: For it is as natural for Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly to cauſe fears and diſquietneſs of minde, as for Phlegme in a Lethargy to cauſe ſleep.</p>
               <p>Do not therefore lay the blame on your Books, Friends, Counſels, Inſtructions (no nor all on your Soul,) if theſe Troubles be not cured by words. But labour to diſcern truly how much of your Trouble comes this way, and then fix it in your minde in all your Enquiries, Reading and Hearing, that it is the other part of your Trouble which is truly Rational, and not this part of it which is from Melancholy, that theſe means were ordained to remove (though God may alſo bleſs them extraordinarily to do both.) Only conſtant importunate Prayer, is a fit and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial means for the Curing of all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When you have truly found out, how much of your Diſquietneſs proceeds from Melancholy, acquit your ſoul from that part of it: Still remember in all your ſelf-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, ſelf-judgings and reflections on your heart, that it is not directly to be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with thoſe ſorrowes that come from your Spleen: ſave only remotely, as all other Diſeaſes are the fruits of ſin: as a Lethargick dullneſs is the deſerved fruit of ſin; but he that ſhould charge it immediatly on his ſoul,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57538:35"/>
ſhould wrong himſelf, and he that would attempt the Cure muſt do it on the Body.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If you would have theſe fears and troubles removed, apply your ſelf to the proper Cure of Melancholy. 1. Avoid all paſſions of ſorrow, fear and anger as much as you can; and all occaſions of diſcontent and grief. 2. Avoid much ſolitarineſs, and be moſt commonly in ſome cheerfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: Not that I would have you do as the fooliſh ſinners of the world do, to drink a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Melancholy, and keep company with ſenſual, vain and unprofitable perſons that will draw you deeper into ſin, and ſo make your wound greater inſtead of healing it, and multiply your Troubles when you are forced to look back on your ſinfull loſs of time: But keep company with the more cheerfull ſort of the Godly: There's no mirth like the mirth of Believers, which faith doth fetch from the bloud of Chriſt, and from the Promiſes of the Word, and from experiences of Mercy, and from the ſerious fore-apprehenſions of our everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Bleſſedneſs. Converſe with men of ſtrongeſt faith that have this heavenly mirth, and can ſpeak experimentally of the Joy of the holy Ghoſt; and theſe will be a great help to the reviving of your ſpirit, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging your Melancholy habit, ſo far as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

out a Phyſitian it may be expected. Yet ſometimes it may not be amiſs to confer with ſome that are in your own Caſe, that you may ſee that your Condition is not ſingular: For Melancholy people in ſuch diſtreſſes are ready to think, that never any was in the Caſe as they are in, or at leaſt, never any that were truly godly: when you hear people of the moſt upright lives and that truly fear God, to have the very ſame complaints as you have your ſelf, it may give you ſome hopes that it is not ſo bad as you before did imagin. However be ſure that you avoid ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarineſs as much as you well can. 3. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo take heed of too deep, fixed, muſing thoughts: ſtudying and ſerious meditating be not duties for the deeply-Melancholy (as I ſhall ſhew more in the following Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:) You muſt let thoſe alone till you are better able to perform them; leſt by attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting thoſe duties which you cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, you ſhall utterly diſable your ſelf from all: Therefore I would adviſe you, by all means to ſhake and rowſe your ſelf out of ſuch muſings, and ſuddenly to turn your thoughts away to ſomething elſe. 4. To this end, be ſure that you avoid Idleneſs and want of imployment: which as it is a life not pleaſing to God, ſo is it the opportunity for Melancholy thoughts to be working, and

the chiefeſt ſeaſon for Satan to tempt you. Never let the Devil finde you unimployed: but ſee that you go cheerfully about the works of your Calling, and follow it with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence; and that time which you redeem for ſpiritual exerciſes, let it be moſt ſpent in Thanksgiving, and Prayſes, and heavenly Conference.</p>
               <p>Theſe things may do much for preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and abating your diſeaſe if it be not gone too far: but if it be, you were beſt have recourſe to the Phyſitian, and expect Gods bleſſing in the uſe of means: and you will finde when your Body is once cured, the diſquietneſs of your Minde will vaniſh of it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond part of this Direction was, That you take notice how much of your diſquietneſs may proceed from outward Croſſes: for it is ordinary for theſe to lye at the root and bring the heart into a diſquiet and diſcontent, and then trouble for ſin doth follow after. Alas, how oft have I ſeen that verified of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. The ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of the world worketh death. How many even godly people have I known, that through croſſes in children or friends, or loſſes in their eſtates, or wrongs from men, or perplexities that through ſome unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs they were caſt into, or the like, have
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57538:38"/>
fallen into mortall Diſeaſes, or into ſuch a fixed Melancholy, that ſome of them have gone beſides themſelves, and others have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in fears and doubting ever after, by the removall of the diſquietneſs to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences? How ſad a thing is it, that we ſhould thus add to our own Afflictions? and the heavier we judge the burden, the more we lay on! As if God had not done enough, or would not ſufficiently afflict us? We may more comfortably bear that which God lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on us, then that which we immediately lay upon our ſelves! Croſſes are not great or ſmall according to the bulk of the matter, but according chiefly to the minde of the ſufferer. Or elſe how could holy men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in Tribulation, and be exceeding glad that they are accounted worthy to ſuffer for Chriſt? Reproaches, wrongs, loſſes are all without you: unleſs you open them the door wilfully your ſelf, they cannot come in to the heart. God hath not put the Joy or Grief of your Heart in any other mans pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but in your own. It is you therefore that do your ſelves the greateſt miſchief. God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts your body, or men wrong you in your ſtate of name (a ſmall hurt if it go on fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;) and therefore you will afflict your ſoul! But a ſadder thing yet is it to conſider of, that men fearing God ſhould ſo highly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57538:38"/>
value the things of the world. They who in their Convenants with Chriſt are engaged, to renounce the world, the fleſh and the devil! They that have taken God in Chriſt for their Portion, for their All! and have reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves and all that they have to Chriſts diſpoſe! whoſe very buſineſs in this world, and their Chriſtian life, conſiſteth ſo much in reſiſting the devil, mortifying the fleſh, and overcoming the world: and it is Gods buſineſs in his inward works of Grace, and his outward teachings, and ſharp affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and examples of others, to convince them of the vanity and vexation of the world, and throughly to wean them from it: And yet that it ſhould be ſo high in their eſtimation, and ſit ſo cloſe to their hearts, that they cannot bear the loſs of it without ſuch diſcontent, diſquiet and diſtraction of minde: Yea though when all is gone, they have their God left them, they have their Chriſt ſtill, whom they took for their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, they have opportunities for their ſouls, they have the ſure promiſe of Glory, yea and a promiſe, that all things ſhall work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for their good; yea and for that one thing that is taken from them, they have yet a hundred outward Mercies remaining; that yet even Believers ſhould have ſo much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief! and have their Faith to ſeek when
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57538:39"/>
they ſhould uſe it and live by it! and that God ſhould ſeem ſo ſmall in their eyes as not to ſatisfie or quit them, unleſs they have the world with him; and that the world ſhould ſtill ſeem ſo Amiable, when God hath done ſo much to bring it into contempt! Truly this (and more) ſhews that the work of <hi>Mortification</hi> is very imperfect in profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and that we bend not the force of our daily ſtrivings and endeavours that way. If Chriſtians did beſtow but as much time and pains, in Mortifying the fleſh, and getting down the Intereſt of it in the ſoul, that Chriſts Intereſt may be advanced, as they do about Controverſies, external duties, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities, tasks of devotion, and ſelf tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fears, O what excellent Chriſtians ſhould we then be! and how happily would moſt of our diſquiet be removed! Alas, if we are ſo unfit to part with one outward comfort now, upon the diſpoſal of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers providence, how ſhould we forſake all for Chriſt? or what ſhall we do at death when all muſt be parted with. As ever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you would live in true Chriſtian Peace, ſet more by Chriſt, and leſs by the world, and all things in it; and hold all that you poſſeſs, ſo looſely, that it may not be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to you when you muſt leave them.</p>
               <p>So much for the Troubles that ariſe from

your Body and outward ſtate: All the reſt ſhall be directed for the Curing of thoſe Troubles that ariſe immediatly from more Spiritual Cauſes.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p n="3">3. Be ſure that you firſt lay ſound ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of Gods nature, in your underſtanding: and lay them deeply.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis is the firſt Article of your Creed, and the firſt part of Life Eternal, to know God! His ſubſtance is quite paſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane underſtanding; therefore never make any attempt to reach the knowledge of it, or to have any poſitive conceivings of it, for they will be all but Idols, or falſe concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but his Attributes are manifeſted to our underſtandings. Well, conſider, that even under the terrible Law, when God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims to <hi>Moſes</hi> his own Name, and therein his Nature, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, 7. the firſt and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part is, <hi>The Lord, God, Mercifull and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, long ſuffering, and abundant in Goodneſs and Truth, keeping mercy for thouſands, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin.</hi> And he hath ſworn <hi>that he hath no pleaſure in the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57538:40"/>
death of a ſinner, but rather that he return and live.</hi> Think not therefore of Gods Merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with diminiſhing, extenuating thoughts, nor limit it by the bounds of our frail under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings; for the heavens are not ſo far above the earth, as his thoughts and wayes are above ours. Still remember that you muſt have no low thoughts of Gods Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but apprehend it as bearing proportion with his Power. As it is blaſphemy to limit his Power, ſo it is to limit his Goodneſs. The advantages that your ſoul will get by this right knowledge and eſtimation of Gods Goodneſs, will be theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This will make God appear more Amiable in your eyes; and then you will Love him more readily and abundantly. And Love 1. Is effectually conſolatory in the very working: ſo much Love, uſually ſo much Comfort (I mean this Love of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency: for a Love of Deſire there may be without comfort.) 2. It will breed perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Gods Love to you again, and ſo Comfort. 3. It will be an unqueſtionable evidence of true Grace, and ſo Comfort.</p>
               <p>The Affections follow the Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings conceptions. If you think of God as one that is glad of all advantages againſt you, and delighteth in his Creatures miſery, it is impoſſible you ſhould Love him. The
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57538:40"/>
Love of our ſelves is ſo deeply rooted in nature, that we cannot lay it by, nor Love any thing that is Abſolutely and directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us. We conceive of the devil as an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Enemy to God and man, and one that ſeeks our deſtruction, and therefore we cannot Love him: And the great Cauſe why troubled ſouls do Love God no more, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they repreſent him to themſelves in an ugly, odious ſhape: To think of God, as one that ſeeks and delighteth in mans ruine, is to make him as the devil; and then what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if in ſtead of Loving him, and Delighting in him, you tremble at the thoughts of him, and fly from him! As I have obſerved Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when they have ſeen the devil painted on a wall, in an ugly ſhape, they have partly feared, and partly hated it: If you do ſo by God in your fancy, it is not putting the Name of [God] on him when you have done, that will reconcile your Affections to him, as long as you ſtrip him of his Divine Nature. Remember the holy Ghoſt's deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of God, 1 <hi>Joh</hi> 4.16. <hi>God is Love.</hi> Write theſe words deep in your Underſtanding.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hereby you will have this Advantage alſo, that your thoughts of God will be more ſweet and delightfull to you: For as Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and beautifull ſights to your eyes, and melodious ſounds to your ears, and ſweet
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57538:41"/>
ſmels, taſtes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are all delightfull: when things deformed, ſtinking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are all loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome: and we turn away from one with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency, but for the other, we would often ſee, taſte, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and enjoy them: So is it with the objects of our minde; God hath given no command for Duty, but what moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly agreeth with the nature of the object. He hath therefore bid us, Love God and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in him above all, becauſe he is above all in Goodneſs, even infinitely and unconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vably Good: elſe we could not Love him above all, nor would he ever command us ſo to do: The object is ever as exactly fitted to its part (as to draw out the Love and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of our hearts) as the Precept is on its part (to oblige us to it.) And indeed the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things is a precept to Duty, and it which we call, The Law of Nature.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hereupon will follow this further Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that your Thoughts will be both eaſilyer drawn toward God, and more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and conſtant on him. For delightfull objects draw the heart to them, as the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone doth the Iron: How gladly, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and frequently do you think of your dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt friends? And if you did firmly conceive of God, as one that is ten thouſand times more Gracious, Loving and Amiable then any friend that you have in the world, it
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57538:41"/>
would make you not only to Love him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all friends, but alſo more freely, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfully and unweariedly to think of him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And then you would hence have this further Advantage, that you would have leſſe backwardneſs to any Duty, and leſſe wearineſs in Duty: you would finde more delight in Prayer, Meditation and ſpeech of God, when once God himſelf were more Lovely and delightfull in your eyes.</p>
               <p n="5">5. All theſe Advantages would produce a further, that is, The growth of all your Graces: For its impoſſible but this growth of Love, and frequent delightfull thoughts of God and addreſſes to him, ſhould cauſe an increaſe of all the reſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Hereupon your Evidences would be more clear and diſcernable: For Grace in ſtrength and action would be eaſily found: and would not this reſolve all your doubts at once?</p>
               <p n="7">7. Yea the very exerciſe of theſe ſeverall Graces would be comfortable.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And hereupon you would have more humble familiarity and communion with God: For Love, Delight and frequent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes would overcome ſtrangeneſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquaintance, which make us fly from God, as a Fiſh, or Bird, or wild beaſt will from the face of a man, and would give us acceſs with
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57538:42"/>
boldneſs and confidence. And this would baniſh ſadneſs and terrour, as the Sun diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelleth darkneſs and cold.</p>
               <p n="9">9. At leaſt you would hence have this advantage, That the fixed apprehenſion of Gods Goodneſs and mercifull nature, would cauſe a fixed apprehenſion of the Probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of your Happineſs, as long as you are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be Happy in Gods way. For reaſon will tell you, that he who is Love it ſelf, and whoſe Goodneſs is equal to his Almighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and who hath ſworn, that he hath no pleaſure in the death of a ſinner, but rather that he repent and live, will not deſtroy a poor ſoul that lyeth in ſubmiſſion at his feet, and is ſo far from reſolved rebellion againſt him, that it grieveth that it is no better and can pleaſe him no more.</p>
               <p n="10">10. However, theſe right apprehenſions of God, would overcome thoſe terrours which are raiſed only by falſe apprehenſions of him: And doubtleſs a very great part of mens cauſeleſs troubles, are raiſed from ſuch miſapprehenſions of God. For Satan knows that if he can Bring you to think of God as a cruel Tyrant, and bloudthirſty man-hater, then he can drive you from him in terrour, and turn all your Love and cheerfull obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience into hatred and ſlaviſh fear. I ſay therefore again, Do not only get, but alſo
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57538:42"/>
fix deep in your underſtanding, the higheſt thoughts of Gods natural Goodneſs and Graciouſneſs that poſſibly you can raiſe: for when they are at the higheſt, they come ſhort ten thouſand fold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But, Gods Goodneſs lyeth not in Mercy to men, as I have read in great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines: he may be perfectly Good, though he ſhould for ever torment the moſt innocent creatures?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe are ignorant preſumptuous intruſions into that which is unſearchable. Where doth Scripture ſay as you ſay? Judge of God as he revealeth himſelf, or you will but delude your ſelf and abuſe him. All his works repreſent him mercifull: for his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is over all his works, and legible in them all. His word ſaith, <hi>He is Good and doth Good, Pſal.</hi> 119.68. and 145.9. How himſelf doth proclaim his own Name, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, 7. I told you before. The moſt mercifull men are his livelieſt Image: and therefore he plants Mercy in them in their converſion, as a principal part of their new nature: and commands of mercifulneſs are a great part of his Law; and he bids us, <hi>Be mercifull as our heavenly Father is mercifull,</hi> Luk. 6.36. Now if this were none of his Nature, how could he be the pattern of our new nature herein? and if he were not infinitely Mercifull
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57538:43"/>
himſelf, how could we be required to be Mercifull as he is? Who dare ſay, I am more Mercifull then God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But God is Juſt as well as Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: and for all his Mercifull nature, he will damn moſt of the world for ever in hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. But <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Mercy rejoiceth againſt Judgement,</hi> Jam. 2.13. 2. God is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily the Governour of the world (while there is a world) and therefore muſt govern it in Juſtice, and ſo muſt not ſuffer his Mercy to be perpetually abuſed by wicked, wilfull, contemptuous ſinners. But then conſider two things; 1. That he deſtroyeth not humble ſouls that lye at his feet, and are willing to have Mercy on his eaſie termes; but only the ſtubborn deſpiſers of his Mercy: He damneth none but thoſe that will not be ſaved in his way; that is, that will not accept of Chriſt and ſalvation freely given them (I ſpeak of thoſe that hear the Goſpel: for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers their caſe is more unknown to us:) And is it any diminution to his infinite Mercy, that he will not ſave thoſe that will not be intreated to accept of ſalvation? 2. And conſider how long he uſeth to wait on ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and even beſeech them to be reconciled to him, before he deſtroyeth them: and that he heapeth multitudes of Mercies on them, even in their rebellion, to draw them
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57538:43"/>
to Repentance and ſo to Life? and is it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifulneſs yet if ſuch men periſh?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But if God were ſo infinite in Mercy, as you ſay, Why doth he not make all theſe men willing, that ſo they may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> God having created the world and all things in it, at firſt, did make them in a certain nature and order, and ſo ſtabliſh them, as by a fixed Law: and he thereupon is their Governour, to govern every thing according to its nature. Now mans Nature was to be Principled with an Inclination to his own Happineſs, and to be lead to it by objects in a Morall way, and in the choice of means to be a free agent, and the Guider of himſelf under God. As Governour of the Rational creature, God doth continue that ſame courſe of Ruling them by Laws, and drawing them by ends and objects, as their natures do require: And in this way he is not wanting to them: His Laws are now Laws of Grace, and univerſal in the tenour of the free Gift and Promiſe: for he hath there given life in Chriſt to all that will have it: and the objects propounded are ſufficient in their kinde, to work even the moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull effects on mens ſouls; for they are, God himſelf, and Chriſt, and glory: Beſides, God giveth men natural faculties, that they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57538:44"/>
may have the uſe of reaſon; and there is nothing more unreaſonable then to refuſe this offered Mercy. He giveth inducing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments in the written Word and Sermons; and addeth ſuch Mercies and Afflictions that one would think ſhould bow the hardeſt heart. Beſides, the ſtrivings and motions of his Spirit within, which are more then we can give an account of. Now is not this as much as belongs to God as Governour of the Creature according to its Nature? And for the Giving of a New nature, and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting New hearts in men, after all their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious rejecting of Grace, this is a certain Miracle of Mercy, and belongs to God in another Relation (even as the free chooſer of his Elect,) and not directly as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the univerſe. This is from his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Providence, and the former from his General. Now ſpecial Providences are not to be as common as the General, nor to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Gods ordinary eſtabliſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Courſe of Government. If God pleaſe to ſtop Jordan, and dry up the Red Sea for the paſſage of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and to cauſe the Sun to ſtand ſtill for <hi>Joſhua,</hi> muſt he do ſo ſtill for every man in the world, or elſe be accounted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull? The ſenſe of this Objection is plainly this: God is not ſo rich in Mercy, except he will New make all the World, or
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57538:44"/>
Govern it above its Nature. Suppoſe a King know his ſubjects to be ſo wicked, that they have every one a full deſign to famiſh or kill themſelves, or poiſon themſelves with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is enticing by its ſweetneſs. The King not only makes a Law, ſtrictly charging them all to forbear to touch that poiſon, but he ſendeth ſpecial Meſſengers to entreat them to it, and tell them the danger? If theſe men will not hear him, but wilfully poiſon themſelves, is he therefore unmercifull? But ſuppoſe that he hath three or four of his ſons that are infected with the ſame wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and he will not only command and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat them, but he will alſo lock them up, or keep the poiſon from them, or will feed them by violence with bitter food? is he unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull unleſs he will do ſo by all the reſt of his Kingdom?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, If all this will not ſatisfie you; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, 1. That it is moſt certain that God is Love, and infinite in Mercy, and hath no pleaſure in the death of ſinners. 2. But it is utterly uncertain to us, how God worketh on mans will inwardly by his Spirit. 3. Or yet what intollerable inconvenience there may be, if God ſhould work in other wayes, therefore we muſt not upon ſuch uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, deny certainties; nor from ſome unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſcruples about the manner of Gods
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57538:45"/>
working Grace, deny the bleſſed Nature of God, which himſelf hath moſt evidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed to the world.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid the more of this, becauſe I finde Satan harp ſo much on this ſtring, with many troubled ſouls, eſpecially on the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of ſome common doctrines. For falſe doctrine ſtill tends to the overthrow of ſolid Peace and Comfort. Remember there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before all other thoughts for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Peace, to get high thoughts of the Gracious and Lovely Nature of God.</p>

               <p>THough there can no more be ſaid of the Gracious Nature of the Son, then of the Father's, even, that his Goodneſs is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite; yet theſe two advantages this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration will add unto the former. 1. You will ſee here Goodneſs and Mercy in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion, and neerer to you then in the Divine Nature alone it was. Our thoughts
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57538:45"/>
of God are neceſſarily more ſtrange, becauſe of our Infinite diſtance from the Godhead: and therefore our apprehenſions of Gods Goodneſs will be the leſſe working, becauſe leſſe familiar. But in Chriſt God is come down into our Nature, and ſo Infinite Goodneſs and Mercy is incarnate. The man Chriſt Jeſus is able now to ſave to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all that come to God by him. We have a Mercifull High Prieſt that is acquainted with our Infirmities. 2. Herein we ſee the Will of God putting forth it ſelf for our help in the moſt aſtoniſhing way that could be imagined. Here is more then meerly a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious inclination. Its an <hi>Office</hi> of ſaving and ſhewing Mercy alſo that Chriſt hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken; even to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt: to bring home ſtraying ſouls to God: to be the great Peace-maker between God and man: to Reconcile God to man and man to God: and ſo to be the Head and Husband of his people. Certainly the Devil ſtrangely wrongeth poor troubled ſouls in this point; that he can bring them to have ſuch hard ſuſpicious thoughts of Chriſt, and ſo much to overlook the Glory of Mercy which ſo ſhineth in the face of the Son of Mercy it ſelf. How can we more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the Nature of Chriſt, and the Goſpel-deſcription of him, then to think him a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57538:46"/>
deſtroying hater of his creatures, and one that watcheth for our halting, and hath more mind to hurt us then to help us? How could he have manifeſted more willingneſs to ſave? and more tender compaſſion to the ſouls of men, then he hath fully manifeſted? That the Godhead ſhould condeſcend to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume our Nature, is a thing ſo wonderfull even to aſtoniſhment, that it puts faith to it to apprehend it: For it is ten thouſand times more condeſcenſion, then for the greateſt King to become a Fly or a Toad to ſave ſuch creatures. And ſhall we ever have low and ſuſpicious thoughts of the Gracious and Mercifull Nature of Chriſt after ſo ſtrange and full a diſcovery of it? If twenty were ready to drown in the ſea, and if one that were able to ſwim and fetch them all out, ſhould caſt himſelf into the water, and offer them his help, were it not fooliſh ingratitude for any to ſay, <hi>I know not yet whether he be willing to help me, or not</hi>; and ſo to have Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thoughts of his good will; and ſo periſh in refuſing his help? How tenderly did Chriſt deal with all ſorts of ſinners?

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have learned 1. To perform the Duty, 2. And to Receive the Comforts which General Grace affordeth. Such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>methodical diſorderly proceedings, keepeth thouſands of poor ignorant Chriſtians in darkneſs and trouble almoſt all their daies. Let the firſt thing you do, be to obey the voice of the Goſpel, which calleth you to Accept of Chriſt and ſpecial Mercy: <hi>This is the Record that God hath given us eternal Life, and this life is in his Son: He that hath the Son hath life.</hi> Fix this deep in your minde;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57538:49"/>
that the nature of the Goſpel is firſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to our Underſtandings, the moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Nature, undertakings and performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſt for us (which muſt be beleeved to be true:) And 2. To Offer this Chriſt with all his ſpecial Mercy to every man to whom this Goſpel comes, and to Intreat them to Accept Chriſt and Life, which is freely given and offered to them. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber then, You are a loſt ſinner: for certain Chriſt and Life in him is given and offered to you. Now your firſt work is, Preſently to accept it: not to make an unſeaſonable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, Whether Chriſt be yours? but to Take him that he may be yours. If you were Condemned, and a Pardon were freely Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you, on Condition you would Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Take it, and it were offered to you and you intreated to take it; what would you do in this Caſe? would you ſpend your time and thoughts in ſearching whether this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don be already yours? or would you not preſently Take it that it may be yours? Or if you were ready to famiſh, and food were offered you; would you ſtand asking firſt, How ſhall I know that it is mine? or rather Take and Eat it, when you are ſure it may be yours if you will. Let me intreat you therefore, when the devil clamours in your ears [Chriſt and Salvation is none of thine,]
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57538:49"/>
ſuppoſe that this voice of God in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel were ſtill in your ears, yea let it be ſtill in your memory [O Take Chriſt, and Life in him, that thou maiſt be ſaved:] ſtill think that you hear <hi>Paul</hi> following you with theſe words [<hi>We are Embaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us: we pray you in Christs ſtead, be Reconciled to God.</hi>] Will you but remember this, when you are on your knees in ſorrow; and when you would fain have Chriſt and Life, and you are afraid that God will not give them to you? I ſay, Remember then, God ſtands by Beſeeching you to Accept the ſame thing which you are Beſeeching him to give. God is the firſt ſuitor and ſolicitor: God Prayes you to Take Chriſt, and you Pray him to give you Chriſt: what have you now to do, but to Take him? And here underſtand, that this Taking is no Impoſſible buſineſs; it is no more but your hearty <hi>Conſenting,</hi> as I ſhall tell you more anon. If you did but well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and conſider, that Beleeving is the great Duty that God calls you to perform, and promiſeth to ſave you if you do truly perform it; and that this Beleeving is to Take, or Conſent to have the ſame Mercy which you pray for, and are troubled for fear leaſt you ſhall miſſe of it, even Chriſt and life in him; this would preſently draw forth your
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57538:50"/>
Conſent, and that in ſo open and expreſs a way, as you could not but diſcover it, and have the comfort of it. Remember this then, That your firſt work is to Beleeve, or Accept an offered Saviour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You muſt learn (as I told you,) to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Comforts of Univerſal or General Grace, before you ſearch after the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of Special Grace. (I here ſuppoſe you ſo far ſound in the doctrine of the Goſpel, as neither with ſome on one hand, to look ſo much at Special Grace, as to deny that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Grace which is the Ground of it, or preſuppoſed to it: nor with others, ſo far to look at univerſal Mercy as to deny Special.) Satan will tell you, that all your Duties have been done in hypocriſie, and you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound at the heart, and have not a drop of ſaving Grace: You are apt to entertain this, and conclude that all this is true: If I had any Grace, I ſhould have more Life, and Love and Delight in God; more tenderneſs of heart, more growth in Grace: I ſhould not carry about ſuch a Rock in my breaſt; ſuch a ſtupid, dull, inſenſible ſoul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the preſent let us ſuppoſe that all this be true: yet ſee what a world of Comfort you may gather from Univerſal or General Mercy. I have before opened to you four parts of it in the Cauſe of your Happineſs,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57538:50"/>
and three in the Effect, which may each of them afford much relief to your troubled ſoul.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Suppoſe you are yet Graceleſs, is it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to you that it is a God of Infinite Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that you have to do with? whoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions are ten thouſand times greater then your deareſt friends or your own husbands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> O but yet he will not ſave the Graceleſs?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> True: but he is the more ready to give Grace, that you may be ſaved. <hi>If any of you</hi> (mark, any of you) <hi>do lack wiſdome, let him ask it of God, who giveth to all men libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> (without deſert) <hi>and upbraideth not</hi> (with our unworthineſs or former faults) <hi>and it ſhall be given him,</hi> Jam. 1.4. <hi>If you that are evil can give good gifts to your children, how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give his holy Spirit to them that ask it,</hi> Luk. 11.13. Suppoſe your life were in the hands of your own husband, or your childrens life in your hands, would it not exceedingly comfort you or them, to conſider, whoſe hands they are in? though yet you had no further Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance how you ſhould be uſed? It may be you will ſay, But God is no Father to the Graceleſs? I anſwer: He is not their Father in ſo neer and ſtrict a ſenſe as he is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Beleevers: but yet a Father he is even
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57538:51"/>
to the wicked: and to convince men of his Fatherly Mercy to them, he often ſo ſtileth himſelf. He ſaith by <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 32.6. to a wicked generation, whoſe ſpot was not the ſpot of his children, <hi>Do ye thus requite the Lord, O fooliſh people and unwiſe? Is not he thy Father that bought thee? hath he not made thee and establiſhed thee?</hi> And the Prodigall could call him <hi>Father</hi> for his encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, before he returned to him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.16, 17, 18. For my own part, I muſt needs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that my ſoul hath more frequent ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from the conſideration of Gods Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and Merciful nature, then from the Promiſe it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Furthermore. Suppoſe you were Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs at the preſent; yet is it not an exceeding Comfort, that there is one of ſuch Infinite Compaſſions as the Lord Chriſt, who hath aſſumed our Nature, and is come down to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt; and is more tender hearted to poor ſinners, then we can poſſibly conceive? yea who hath made it his Office to Heal, and Relieve, and Reſtore, and Reconcile: Yea that hath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf endured ſuch temptations as many of ours: <hi>For we have not an high-Prieſt which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, without ſin: Let us therefore</hi> (ſaith the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57538:51"/>
holy Ghoſt) <hi>come boldly unto the throne of Grace, that we may obtain Mercy, and finde Grace to help in time of need,</hi> Heb. 4.15, 16. <hi>Foraſmuch as the children were partakers of fleſh and bloud, he alſo himſelf likewiſe took part with them, that he might deſtroy through death, him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death, were all their lifetime ſubject to bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. For verily he took not on him the nature of Angels, but he took on him the ſeed of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham: Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his Brethren, that he might be a Merciful and faithful high-Prieſt in things pertaining to God, to make Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation for the ſins of the people: For in that he himſelf hath ſuffered being tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted,</hi> Heb. 2.14, 15, 16, 17, 18. Have you diſcountenance from men? Chriſt had much more. Doth God ſeem to forſake you? ſo he did by Chriſt. Are you fain to lye on your knees crying for Mercy? why Chriſt in the days of his fleſh, was fain to offer up <hi>ſtrong cryes and tears, to him that was able to ſave him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and was heard in that he feared.</hi> It ſeems that Chriſt had diſtreſſing fears as well as you, though not ſinful fears. Have you horrid temptations? why Chriſt was tempted to caſt himſelf headlong, and to worſhip the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57538:52"/>
Devil, for worldly preferment: Yea the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil had power to carry his body up and down, to the pinacle of the Temple, and the top of a mountain. If he had ſuch power of you, would you not think your ſelf certainly his ſlave? I conclude therefore, as it is an exceeding ground of comfort to all the ſick people in a City, to know that there is a moſt merciful and skilful Phyſitian, that is eaſily able to cure them, and hath underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to do it freely for all that will take him for their Phyſitian: ſo is it a ground of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding comfort to the worſt of ſinners, to all ſinners (that are yet alive, and have not blaſphemed the holy Ghoſt,) to know what a Merciful and ſufficient Saviour hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the work of mans Redemption.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Alſo, Suppoſe yet that you are Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs: Is it nothing that a ſufficient Sacrifice and Ranſome is given for you? This is the very foundation of all ſolid Peace. I think this is a great comfort, to know that God looks now for no ſatisfaction at your hand: and that the Number or Greatneſs of your ſins, as ſuch, cannot now be your ruine. For certainly, no man ſhall periſh for want of the payment of his Ranſome, or of an expiatory Sacrifice for ſin: but only for want of a willing heart to Accept him that hath freely Ranſomed them.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:57538:52"/>4. Alſo, Suppoſe you are Graceleſs; Is it nothing that God hath under his hand and ſeal made a full and free Deed of Guift, to you and all ſinners, of Chriſt, and with him of pardon and ſalvation? and all this on Condition of your Acceptance or Conſent? I know the Deſpiſers of Chriſt ſhall be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable for all this: But for you that would fain have Chriſt, is it no comfort to know that you ſhall have him if you will? and to finde this to be the ſumme of the Goſpel? I know you have oft read thoſe free offers, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Whoſoever will, let him take of the water of life freely: Hoe every one that thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth, come, and drink,</hi> &amp;c. Almoſt all that I have hitherto ſaid to you, is compriſed in that one text, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as I have ſhewed it you in the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes (what Comfort even General Mercie may afford) ſo let me a little ſhew it you in the Effects. I mean, not only in that God is now ſatisfied; but as to your ſelf and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſinner, theſe three things are produced hereby.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is now a Poſſibility of Salvation to you. And certainly even that ſhould be a very great Comfort. I know you will meet
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57538:53"/>
with ſome Divines, who will tell you that this is no effect of Chriſts death; and that elſe Chriſt ſhould die for God, if he procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him a Power to ſave which he had not before: But this is no better then a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching of our Redeemer. Suppoſe that a Traytor have ſo abuſed a King, that it will neither ſtand with his own Honour, nor Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, nor Laws to pardon him: If his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion were ſo great that his own Son ſhall ſuffer for him, that ſo the King might be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of pardoning him, without any dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of his Honour or Juſtice; were it not a vile reproach, if this Traytor ſhould tell the Prince that ſuffered for him [It was for your Father that you ſuffered to procure him a Power of pardoning: it was not for me.] Its true, the King could not pardon him, without ſatisfaction to his Honour and Juſtice. But this was not through any Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency: but becauſe the thing was not fit to be done: and ſo was Morally Impoſſible. For in Law we ſay, Diſhoneſt things are Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. And it had been no loſſe to the King if the Traytor had not been pardoned. So is it in our Caſe. And therefore Chriſts ſufferings could not be more eminently <hi>for us,</hi> then by enabling the offended Majeſty to forgive us; and ſo taking the greateſt impediment out of the way: for when
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57538:53"/>
impediments are once removed, Gods Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſo Gracious and prone to Mercy, that he would ſoon pardon us when once it is fit to be done, and ſo Morally poſſible in the fulleſt ſenſe: only mens own Unwillingneſs now ſtands in the way, and makes it to be not fully fit to be yet done. Its true, in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote ſenſe, the Pardon of ſin was alway Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; but in the neereſt ſenſe it was Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, till Chriſt made it Poſſible by his Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nay, though you were yet Graceleſs, you have now this Comfort, that your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is Probable as well as Poſſible. You are very fair for it. The termes be not hard in themſelves, on which it is tendered. For Chriſts yoak is eaſie and his burden light, and his Commands are not grievous. <hi>The word is nigh you,</hi> even the offer of Grace: you need not ſay, <hi>who ſhall aſcend to Heaven, or go down to hell?</hi> Rom. 10. But this will appear in the next.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yea, this exceeding Comfort there is, even for them that are Graceleſs, that their Salvation is <hi>Conditionally Certain,</hi> and the Condition is but their <hi>own willingneſs.</hi> They may all have Chriſt and Life if they will. Now I deſire you in all your Doubts, that you will well conſider and improve this one Truth and Ground of Comfort. Would you,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57538:54"/>
in the midſt of your groans, and complaints, and fears, take it for a ſmall mercy, to be certain that you ſhall have Chriſt if you will? when you are praying for Chriſt in fear and anguiſh of ſpirit, if an Angel or voice from Heaven ſhould ſay to you [It ſhall be unto thee according to thy will: If thou wilt have Chriſt and Life in him, thou ſhalt:] would this be no Comfort to you? would it not revive you, and overcome your fears?</p>
               <p>By this time I hope you ſee what abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Comfort General Mercy or Grace may afford the ſoul, before it perceive (yea or receive,) any ſpecial Grace (though few of thoſe that receive not Special Grace can make much uſe of General, yet it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to them as well as others.)</p>
               <p n="1">1. All the terrifying Temptations which are grounded on miſrepreſentations of God (as if he were a cruel deſtroyer to be fled from,) are diſpelled by the due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Goodneſs, and the deep ſetled ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of his Gracious, Merciful, Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Nature (which indeed is the firſt work of true Religion, and the very maſter Radical Act of true Grace, and the chief maintainer of Spiritual Life and Motion.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. All theſe Temptations are yet more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually diſpelled by conſidering this Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57538:54"/>
Divine Nature dwelling in fleſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming man, by condeſcending to the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of our humane Nature; and ſo come neer us, and aſſuming the Office of being the Mediator, the Redeemer, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All your doubts and fears that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from your former ſins, whether of youth or of age, of ignorance or of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and thoſe which proceed from your Legal unworthineſs; have all a preſent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in the fullneſs and ſufficiency of Chriſts ſatisfaction, even for all the world: ſo that no ſin (except the excepted ſin) is ſo great, but it is fully ſatisfied for: and though you are unworthy, yet Chriſt is worthy; and he came into the world to ſave only the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy (in the ſtrict and Legal ſenſe.)</p>
               <p n="4">4. All your doubts and fears that ariſe from an apprehenſion of Gods <hi>unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to ſhew you Mercy, and to give you Chriſt and Life in him, ariſe from the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſion of Chriſts <hi>unwillingneſs</hi> to be <hi>yours</hi>; or at leaſt from the uncertainty of his willingneſs; theſe have all a ſufficient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in the general extent and tenour of the New Covenant. Can you doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God be willing to give you Chriſt and Life, when he hath given them already? even by a Deed of Guift under his hand, and

For though ſin be not Actually Remitted to them, yet is it Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally Remitted, <hi>viz.</hi> if they will but accept of Chriſt offered them. Will you remember this, when your doubts are greateſt, and you conclude that certainly Chriſts is not yours, becauſe you have no true Grace: Suppoſe it be true: Yet ſtill know that Chriſt may be yours if you will, and when you will. This Comfort you may have when you can finde no Evidences of true Grace in your ſelf. So much for that Direction.</p>

                  <p n="8">8. <hi>The next thing that you have to do, for building up a ſtable Comfort, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling your Conſcience in a ſolid Peace, is this</hi>; Be ſure to get and keep a right Underſtanding of the Nature of Saving Faith.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS you muſt have right thoughts of the Covenant of Grace (of which before,) the want whereof doth puzzle and confound very many Chriſtians; ſo you muſt be ſure to have right thoughts of the Condition of the Covenant. For indeed that Grace which cauſeth you to perform this Condition, is your firſt ſpecial ſaving Grace, which you may take as a certain evidence of your Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: And this Condition is the very link which conjoyneth all the General fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Grace to all the reſt of the following ſpecial Grace. The Scripture is ſo full and plain in Aſſuring pardon and ſalvation to all true Believers, that if you can but be ſure that you are a Believer, you need not make any doubt of your intereſt in Chriſt and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57538:56"/>
your ſalvation. Seeing therefore that all the queſtion will be, Whether you have true Faith? Whether you do perform the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the new Covenant? (For all other doubts God hath given you ſufficient ground to reſolve, as is ſaid,) how much then doth it concern you to have a right underſtanding of the Nature of this Faith? Which that you may have let me tell you briefly what it is. Mans ſoul hath two facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Underſtanding and Will: Accordingly the Objects of mans ſoul (all Beings which it is to Receive) have two Modifications; Truth and Goodneſs (as thoſe to be Avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded are Evil.) Accordingly Gods Word or Goſpel hath two parts; the Revelation of Truth, and the Offer and Promiſe of ſome Good. This offered Good is principally and immediatly Chriſt himſelf, to be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us by Covenant as our head and huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: The ſecondary conſequential Good, is Pardon, Juſtification, Reconciliation, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, further Sanctification and Glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which are all offered with Chriſt. By this you may ſee what ſaving Faith is: It is firſt a Believing that the Goſpel is True; and then an Accepting of Chriſt therein of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to us, with his benefits: or a conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that he be ours and we be his; which is nothing but a <hi>true willingneſs to have an
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57538:56"/>
offered Chriſt.</hi> Remember this well; that you may make uſe of it, when you are in doubt of the truth of your Faith. Thouſands of poor ſouls have been in the dark, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſee themſelves to be Believers, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for want of knowing what ſaving Faith is. And, it is a truth that cannot be hid, that Divines who ſhould have taught them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, have been the great cauſe of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; not well and cleerly underſtanding this themſelves. It is a ſhamefull confeſſion: but the world knoweth it already. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts place almoſt all in the meer Aſſent of the Underſtanding. Our great Reformers made it to be either an Aſſurance of the pardon of our own ſins; or a ſtrong per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of their pardon, excluding doubting; or (the moderateſt) a perſwaſion of our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular pardon, though mixt with ſome doubting: The Antinomians ſtrike in with them, and ſay the ſame: Hence even the greateſt of our Divines (<hi>Chamier, Polanus, Twiſſe,</hi> &amp;c.) conclude, that Juſtification and Remiſſion go before faith (a deſperate er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour) becauſe the Act doth alway ſuppoſe its object: For they thought that Remiſſion already paſt, was the object of Juſtifying Faith: ſuppoſing faith to be nothing elſe but a Belief that we are pardoned: Yea or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, it hath been taught in the writings
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57538:57"/>
of our greateſt refuters of the Papiſts, That this Belief is properly a Divine faith, or the Belief of a Divine Teſtimony, as is the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of any Propoſition written in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (a foul error which I have confuted in my book of <hi>Reſt, Part.</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.) Moſt of late have come neerer the truth, and affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Juſtifying Faith to conſiſt in Affiance, or Recumbency, or Reſting on Chriſt for ſalvation. No doubt this is one Act of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying faith; but not that which a poor troubled ſoul ſhould firſt ſearch after and try it ſelf by (except by <hi>Affiance,</hi> any ſhould mean as <hi>Ameſius</hi> doth, <hi>Election of Chriſt:</hi> and then it is the ſame act which I am aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; but very unfitly expreſt.) For 1. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance is not the Principal act, nor that wherein the very life of Juſtifying faith doth conſiſt: but only an imperate following act, and an effect of the vital act (which is Conſent, or Willing, or Accepting Chriſt offered:) for it lyeth mainly in that which we call the ſenſitive part, or the Paſſions of the ſoul. 2. It is therefore leſſe conſtant, and ſo unfitter to try by: For many a poor ſoul that knowes it ſelf unfeignedly willing to have Chriſt, yet feeleth not a Reſting on him or Truſting in him, and therefore crys out, O I cannot believe; and think they have no Faith. For Recumbency, Affiance,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57538:57"/>
or Reſting on Chriſt, implieth that eaſing of themſelves, or caſting off their fears, or doubts, or cares, which true believers do not alwayes finde. Many a poor ſoul complains, O I cannot reſt on Chriſt; I cannot truſt him! who yet would have him to be their Lord and Saviour, and can eaſily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their willingneſs. 3. Beſides, Affiance is not the Adequate act of faith, ſuited to the object in that fullneſs as it muſt be Received: but Willingneſs, or Acceptance, is, Chriſt is Reſted on only for our ſelves as our Deliverer: but he is Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted alſo for Himſelf as our Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. The full proof of theſe, I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in other Writings, and oft in your hearing in publike, and therefore omit them now. Be ſure then to fix this truth deep in your minde. That Juſtifying faith is not an Aſſurance of our Juſtification, no nor a perſwaſion or belief that we are Juſtified or pardoned, or that Chriſt died more for us then for others; nor yet is Affiance or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting on Chriſt the vital, principal, certain, conſtant full act: but it is the Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings belief of the truth of the Goſpel, and the Will's Acceptance of Chriſt and Life of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to us therein: which Acceptance is but the hearty Conſent or Willingneſs that he be yours and you his. This is the Faith
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57538:58"/>
which muſt Juſtifie and ſave you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But 1. May not wicked men be Willing to have Chriſt? 2. And do not you oft tell us that Juſtifying faith comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Love to Chriſt and Thankfulneſs, and that it receiveth him as a Lord to be obeyed, as well as a Deliverer? and that Repentance and ſincere Obedience, are parts of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the new Covenant?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I will give as brief a touch now on theſe as may be, becauſe I have handled them in ſitter places. 1. Wicked men are willing to have Remiſſion, Juſtification and freedom from hell (for no man can be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be unpardoned or to be damned:) But they are not willing to have Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in that nature and office which he muſt be Accepted; that is, <hi>As a holy Head and Huſband, to ſave them both from the Guilt, and Power, and all defilement and abode of ſin, and to Rule them by his Law, and Guide them by his Spirit, and to make them happy by bringing them to God, that being without ſin, they may be perfectly Pleaſing and Amiable in his ſight, and enjoy him forever.</hi> Thus is Chriſt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thus to be accepted of all that will be ſaved; and thus no wicked man will accept him (but when he ceaſeth to be wicked.) 2. (To cut all the reſt ſhort, in a word, I ſay, That) in this fore-deſcribed Willingneſs
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57538:58"/>
or Acceptance, Repentance, Love, Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Reſolution to obey, are all contained, or neerly implyed, as I have elſewhere ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted; ſo that the Heart of ſaving faith, is this Acceptance of Chriſt, or Willingneſs to have him to Juſtifie, Sanctifie, Guide and Govern you. Finde but this Willingneſs, and you finde all the reſt, whether you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſee them or not. So much for that Direction.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>YOur ſoul ſtands in extreme need of a Saviour: God offereth you a Saviour in the Goſpel, what then have you next to do, but Accept him? Believe that this offer is general, and therefore to you: and that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57538:59"/>
Chriſt is not ſet to ſale, nor doth God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire you to bring a Price in your hand: but only heartily and thankfully to Accept of what he freely giveth you. This muſt be done before you fall on trying your Graces to get Aſſurance: for you muſt have Grace, before you can diſcover it: and this is the firſt proper ſpecial ſaving Grace (as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizeth that knowledge and Aſſent which neceſſarily go before it.) This is not only the method for thoſe that yet never believed, but alſo for them that have loſt the ſenſe of their faith, and ſo the ſight of their evidence. Believe again, that you may know you do believe; or at leaſt may poſſeſſe an Accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Saviour. When God in the Goſpel bids you, Take Jeſus Chriſt, and beſeecheth you to be reconciled to him; what will you ſay to him? If your heart anſwer, <hi>Lord I am willing, I will Accept of Chriſt and be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi>; why, then the match is made between Chriſt and you: and the marriage Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is truly entered, which none can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve. If Chriſt were not firſt willing, he would not be the ſuitor and make the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and if he be willing, and you be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, what can break the match? If you will ſay, <hi>I cannot believe,</hi> if you underſtand what you ſay, either you mean that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe the Goſpel is true; or elſe that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57538:59"/>
you cannot be willing that Chriſt ſhould be yours. If it be the former, and you ſpeak truly, then you are a flat Infidel (yet many temptations to doubt of the truth of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, a true believer may have, yea and actual doubtings; but his faith prevaileth and is victorious over them:) But if you really doubt whether the Goſpel be true, uſe Gods means for the diſcovery of its truth. Read what I have written in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of my book of <hi>Reſt:</hi> I will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take now more confidently then ever I did, to prove the truth of Scripture, by plain, full, undeniable force of Reaſon. But I ſuppoſe this is none of your caſe. If therefore when you ſay, that you cannot believe, you mean that you cannot Accept an offered Chriſt, or be willing to have him: then I demand, 1. What is your reaſon? the Will is lead by the Reaſon of the Underſtanding. If you be not willing, there is ſomething that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades you to be unwilling. This Reaſon muſt be from ſomething reall, or elſe upon a miſtake, upon ſuppoſal of ſomething that is not in being. If it be upon miſtake, either it is that you be not convinced of Chriſts wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to be yours; and if you thought he did conſent, you would conſent willingly: If this be it, you do truly believe while you think you do not: for you do conſent (and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57538:60"/>
that's all on your part to make the match) and Chriſt doth certainly conſent, though you do not underſtand it: In this caſe it concerneth you, to underſtand better the extent of the new Covenant, and then you will be paſt doubt of the willingneſs of Chriſt, and ſee that wherever the match breaks, it is only for want of conſent in men; for Chriſt is the firſt ſuitor, and hath long ago in the Covenant proclaimed his conſent, to be the Head and Husband of every ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, on condition they will but conſent to be his.</p>
               <p>If your miſtake be from any falſe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the Nature of Chriſt, as if he were not a ſufficient Saviour, or were ſuch an enemy to your comfort that he would do you more hurt then good; if theſe miſtakes are prevalent, then you do not know Chriſt, and therefore muſt preſently better ſtudy him in the Goſpel, till you have prevailed over ſuch ignorant and blaſphemous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits (but none of this I ſuppoſe is your caſe.)</p>
               <p>If then the reaſon why you ſay, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe, be from any thing that is really in Chriſt (and not upon miſtake,) then it muſt be either from ſome diſlike of his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving work, by which he would pardon you, and ſave you from damnation (but that is
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57538:60"/>
impoſſible; for you cannot be willing to be damned or unpardoned, till you loſe your Reaſon:) Or elſe it is from a diſlike of his work of ſanctification, by which he would cleanſe your heart and life, by ſaving you from your ſinfull nature and actions: ſome grudgings againſt Chriſts holy and undefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Laws and wayes will be in the beſt, while there is that fleſh in them which luſteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Spirit, ſo that they cannot do the things they would: But if truly you have ſuch a diſlike of a ſinleſs condition, through the love of any ſin or creature, that you cannot be willing to have Chriſt to cure you and cleanſe you from that ſin, and make you holy, I ſay, if this be true, in a prevailing degree, ſo that if Chriſt and Holineſs were offered you, you would not Accept them, then it is certain you have not true faith. And in this caſe it is eaſie to diſcern, that your firſt work lyeth not in getting Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort or eaſe to your troubled minde, but in getting better conceits of Chriſt and a holy ſtate and life, that ſo you may be willing of Chriſt as Chriſt is of you, and ſo become a true believer.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. You muſt diſtinguiſh between wicked men as actually wicked and going on in the proſecution of their wickedneſs; and wicked men as they have ſome good in them, or are doing ſome good, or are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting a return to God. 2. You muſt diſtinguiſh between real Prayer and ſeeming prayer. 3. You muſt diſtinguiſh between full Acceptance of Prayer, when God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in them, and an Acceptance only to ſome particular end, not intimating the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of the perſon with his prayer: And between Acceptance fully Promiſed (as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain) and Acceptance but half-promiſed (as
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57538:61"/>
Probable:) And upon theſe diſtinctions I ſhall anſwer your objection in the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When wicked men pray God to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper them in their wickedneſs, yea or to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them while they intend to go on in it, and ſo to give them an indulgence in ſin; or when they think with a few prayers for ſome Good which they can endure, to put by that Holineſs which they cannot endure, and ſo to make a cloak for their rebellion, theſe prayers are all an abomination to the Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When men uſe the words of a Prayer without the deſire of the thing asked, this is no Prayer, but equivocally ſo called, as a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſſe is a man: and therefore no wonder if God abhor that Prayer, which truly is no Prayer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God hath not made a full Promiſe, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaining any wicked man, while wicked, that he will hear his Prayer: for all ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are made to Believers.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God doth never ſo hear an unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Prayer, as to accept his perſon with his Prayer, or to take a complacency in them. So much for the Negative.</p>
               <p>Now for the Affirmative I add: 1. Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is a duty which God enjoyned even wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men (I could prove it by a hundred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture texts.)</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:57538:62"/>2. There may be ſome good deſires in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, which they may expreſs in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and theſe God may ſo far hear as to grant them, as he did in part to <hi>Ahab.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. An unbeliever may lye under prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Grace, and be on his way in returning towards God, though yet he be not come to ſaving faith; and in this ſtate he may have many good deſires, and ſuch Prayers as God will hear.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Though God have not flatly engaged himſelf to unbelievers, ſo as to give them a certainty of hearing their prayers, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them true Grace on the improvement of their naturals, yet he hath not only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them this and other means to get Grace, but alſo given them half promiſes, or ſtrong probabilities of ſpeeding, ſo much as may be a ſufficient encouragement to any ſuch ſinner to call on God and uſe his Means. For as he appointeth not any vain Means to man, ſo no man can name that man who did improve his naturals to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and in particular, ſought God in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſo far as a natural man may do, who yet miſt of Grace and was rejected (This is the true mean between Pelagianiſme and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomianiſme in this point.)</p>
               <p n="5">5. When God calls unbelievers to Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he withall calls them to Believe: and when
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57538:62"/>
he works their heart to Prayer by that call, he uſually withall works them to Believe, or at leaſt towards believing. If he that was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to have Chriſt, do pray God to make him willing, it is a beginning of willingneſs already, and the way to get more willingneſs. In Prayer God uſeth to give in the thing prayed for, of this kinde.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Prayer is the ſouls motion Godward: and to ſay an unbeleever ſhould not pray, is to ſay he ſhould not turn to God: who yet ſaith to the wicked, <hi>Seek the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is neer; Let the wicked forſake his way,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.6, 7.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Prayer hath two parts, Deſire is the ſoul of it, and Expreſſion is the body: the ſoul can live ſeparated from the body, but ſo cannot the body ſeparated from the ſoul: ſo can Deſire without Expreſſion, but not Expreſſion without Deſire. When our blind Antinomians (the great ſubverters of the Goſpel, more then the Law) do rail againſt Miniſters for perſwading wicked men to Pray, they are againſt us for perſwading men to Deſire that they pray for: Prayer having Deſire for its ſoul. And do not thoſe men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be exterminated the Churches and ſocieties of the Saints, who dare ſay to a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked unbeliever, <hi>Deſire not Faith: Deſire not to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57538:63"/>
leave thy wickedneſs: Deſire not Grace, or Chriſt, or God:</hi> and that will proclaim abroad the world (as I have oft heard them with zealous reproaches,) that our Miniſters are Legaliſts, Seducers, Ignorant of the Myſteries of the Goſpel, becauſe they perſwade poor ſinners to Pray for Faith, Grace, and Chriſt; that is, to Deſire theſe, and to expreſs their Deſires; which in effect is to perſwade them to Repent, Believe and turn to God. Indeed if theſe blind Seducers had ever heard our Miniſters perſwading wicked men to Diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and lye to God, and ask Faith, Grace and Chriſt with their tongues, but not Deſire them in their hearts, then had they ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient grounds for their reviling language (but I have been too long on this.) I may therefore boldly conclude, that they that finde themſelves unbelievers, that is, unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have Chriſt to deliver them from ſin, muſt uſe this ſecond Means to get faith, even earneſt frequent Prayer for it, to God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let ſuch alſo ſee that they avoid wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſeducing company and occaſions of ſin: and be ſure that they keep company with men fearing God, eſpecially joyning with them in their holy duties.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, Let ſuch be ſure that they uſe that Reaſon which God hath given them, to conſider frequently, retiredly, ſeriouſly of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57538:63"/>
the vanity of all thoſe things that ſteal away their hearts from Chriſt; and of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Holineſs, and how bleſſed a ſtate it is, to have nothing in us in heart or life that is diſpleaſing to God, but to be ſuch as he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth full delight in; alſo of the certainty of the damnation of unbeleevers, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerableneſs of their torments; and of the certainty and unconceivable greatneſs of Believers everlaſting Happineſs. If wicked unbelievers would but do what they can in daily, ſerious, deep conſidering of theſe things and the like, they would have no cauſe to deſpair of obtaining Faith and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification. Believing is a Rational Act: God bids you not to Believe any thing without Reaſon, nor to Accept or Conſent to any thing without full Reaſon to cauſe you to conſent. Think then often and ſoberly of thoſe Reaſons that ſhould move you to Conſent, and of the vanity of theſe that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you from Conſenting, and this is Gods way for you to obtain Faith or Conſent.</p>
               <p>Remember then that when you have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood and improved General grounds of Comfort (nay before you can come to any full improvement of them,) your next buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is to Believe: to Conſent to the Match with Chriſt, and to Take him for your Lord and Saviour: And this Duty muſt be lookt to

and performed, before you look after ſpecial Comfort. But I ſaid ſomewhat of this before under the ſixth Head, and therefore will ſay no more now.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p n="10">10. <hi>When you have gone thus far, your Soul is ſafe and you are paſt your grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Dangers, though yet you are not past your Fears: Your next work therefore for Peace and Comfort is this,</hi> To Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view and take Notice of your own Faith, and thence to gather Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Certainty of your Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and Adoption, and right to Glory.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe ſumme of this Direction lyeth in theſe things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. See that you do not content your ſelf with the forementioned general Comforts, without looking after Aſſurance and ſpecial Comforts. The folly of this I have manifeſted in the third part of my book of Reſt, about ſelf-examination.</p>
               <p n="2">2. See that you dream not of finding Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57538:64"/>
and ſpecial Comfort from meer gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Grounds: This is the deluſion of many Antinomians, and of moſt of our prophane people (who I finde are commonly of the Antinomian faith, naturally withouth teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.) For men to conclude that they ſhall certainly be ſaved, meerly becauſe God is Mercifull, or Chriſt is tender-hearted to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and would not that any ſhould periſh, but all ſhould come to Repentance, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God delights not in the death of him that dieth, but rather that he Repent and live; or becauſe Chriſt died for them; or becauſe God hath given Chriſt and Life in the Goſpel to all on Condition of believing; theſe are all but meer deluſions. Much Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, as I have ſhewed you, may be gathered from theſe Generals: but no Certainty of Salvation, or ſpecial Comfort can be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from them alone.</p>
               <p n="3">3. See that you reject the Antinomian doctrine or dotage, which would teach you to reject the tryal and judging of your ſtate by ſignes of Grace in your ſelf, and tell you that it is only the Spirit that muſt Aſſure, by witneſſing your Adoption. I will further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine this Caution, when I have added the reſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And on the other extream, do not run to Marks <hi>unſeaſonably,</hi> but in the order here laid down.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:57538:65"/>5. Nor do not truſt to unſafe Marks.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And therefore do not look at too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; for the true ones, are but few. I do but name theſe things to you, becauſe I have ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyer handled them in my book of Reſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I muſt refer you. And ſo I return to the third Caution.</p>
               <p>I have in the forementioned Book told you, what the Office of the Spirit is in Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring us, and what the uſe of Marks are. The Spirit witneſſeth firſt Objectively, and ſo the Spirit and Marks are all one. For it is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit dwelling in us that is the witneſs or proof that we are Gods ſons: for he that hath not his Spirit is none of his: and the Spirit is not diſcerned by us in its eſſence, but in its work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: and therefore, to diſcern theſe work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings is to diſcern the Spirit: and theſe work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are the Marks that we ſpeak of: ſo that the Spirit witneſſeth our ſonſhip, as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſoul witneſſeth that you are a man and not a beaſt. You find by the Acts of Reaſon that you have a Reaſonable ſoul, and then you know that having a Reaſonable ſoul, you are certainly a man: So you finde by the works or fruits of the Spirit, that you have the Spirit, (that is, by Marks: and <hi>Paul</hi> enumerates the fruits of the Spirit to that end) and then by finding that you have the Spirit, you may certainly know that you are
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57538:65"/>
the child of God. 2. Alſo, as the Reaſonable ſoul is its own diſcerner by the help of the body (while it is in it) and ſo witneſſeth our Humanity effectively as well as objectively (but firſt in order objectively and next effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively:) ſo doth the Spirit effectively diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it ſelf to the ſoul, by illuminating us to diſcern it, and exciting us to ſearch, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us that ſpiritual taſt and feeling of its workings, and ſo of its preſence, by which it is beſt known. But ſtill it witneſſeth objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely firſt; and its effective witneſſing, is but the cauſing us to diſcern its objective wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Or (to ſpeak more plainly,) The Spirit witneſſeth firſt and principally by giving us thoſe Graces and workings which are our Marks; and then ſecondly, by helping us to finde and feel thoſe workings or Marks in our ſelves; and then laſtly by raiſing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in the ſoul upon that diſcovery. Take heed therefore of expecting any ſuch inward witneſs of the Spirit, as ſome expect, <hi>viz.</hi> a diſcovery of your Adoption directly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out firſt diſcovering the ſignes of it within you; as if by an inward voice he ſhould ſay to you, Thou art a childe of God, and thy ſins are pardoned.</p>
               <p>This that I deſcribed to you, is the true witneſs of the Spirit. This miſtake is ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, that I had thought to have made it a
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57538:66"/>
peculiar Direction by it ſelf to warn you of it: but now I have gone ſo far I will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch it here. Two dangerous conſequents I finde do follow this unwarrantable expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of the firſt immediate efficient Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation that we are Adopted.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some poor ſouls have languiſhed in doubtings and trouble of minde almoſt all their daies, in expectation of ſuch a kinde of witneſs as the Spirit uſeth not to give: when in the mean time they have other ſufficient means of Comfort, and knew not how to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them; yea they had the true witneſs of the Spirit in his inhabitation and holy workings, and did not know it; but run as <hi>Samuel</hi> did to <hi>Eli,</hi> not knowing the voice of God: and look for the Spirits teſtimony when they had it, as the Jews for <hi>Elias</hi> and the Meſſias.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Others do more dangerouſly erre, by taking the ſtrong conceit of their own phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie for the witneſs of the Spirit. As ſoon as they do but entertain the opinion that it muſt be ſuch a witneſs of the Spirit, without the uſe of Marks, that muſt Aſſure men of their Adoption, preſently they are confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that they have that witneſs themſelves. It is ſcarce likely to be Gods Spirit that is ſo ready upon the meer change of an opinion: The devil uſeth to do as much to cheriſh
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57538:66"/>
preſumption, as to deſtroy true faith and Aſſurance. It is a ſhrewd ſigne that our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of our truth of Grace is a deluſion, when we finde the devil a friend to it, and helping it on: and it is a probable ſigne it is a good perſwaſion, when we finde the devil an enemy to it, and ſtill troubling us, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring our diſquiet.</p>
               <p>And here I remember the ſcruple that troubleth ſome about the ſpirit of bondage, and the ſpirit of Adoption. But you muſt underſtand that by the ſpirit of bondage, is meant, that ſpirit, and thoſe operations on the ſoul which the Law of Works did natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally beget in thoſe that were under it; which was, to be partly in bondage to a task of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonious duties, and partly to the Curſe, and obligation to Puniſhment for diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, without any Power to Juſtifie: They were ſaid therefore to be in bondage to the Law; and the Law was ſaid to be a Yoak which neither they nor their fathers were able to bear, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>And by the ſpirit of Adoption is meant, 1. That ſpirit, or thoſe qualifications and workings in their ſouls, which by the Goſpel God giveth only to his ſons: 2. And which raiſe in us ſome child-like affections to God, enclining us in all our wants to run to him in Prayer as to a Father, and to make our moan
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57538:67"/>
to him, and open our griefs, and cry for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, and look to him and depend on him as a childe on the father. This ſpirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you may have, and yet not be certain of Gods ſpecial Love to you. The knowledge only of his general Goodneſs and Mercy, may be a means to raiſe in you true child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like affections. You may know God to have fatherly inclinations to you, and yet doubt whether he will uſe you as a childe, for want of Aſſurance of your own ſincerity. And you may hope God is your father, when yet you may apprehend him to be a diſpleaſed angry father, and ſo he may be more your terror then your comfort. Are not you rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in moſt of your fears, and doubts, and troubles, to go to God before all other for relief? and doth not your heart ſigh and groan to him when you can ſcarcely ſpeak? Doth not your troubled ſpirit there finde its firſt vent? and ſay, <hi>Lord, kill me not: forſake me not: my life is in thy hands: O ſoften this hard heart, make this carnal minde more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual! O be not ſuch a ſtranger to my ſoul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Woe to me that I am ſo ignorant of thee! ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected to thee! ſo backward and diſinclined to holy communion with thee! Woe to me that I can take no more pleaſure in thee! and am ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> mindleſs and diſregardfull of thee! O that thou wouldſt ſtir up in me more lively deſires, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57538:67"/>
workings of my ſoul toward thee! and ſuffer me not to lye at ſuch a diſtance from thee.</hi> Are not ſuch as theſe the breathings of your ſpirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why theſe are child-like breathings after God! this is crying <hi>Abba, Father.</hi> This is the work of the ſpirit of Adoption, even when you fear God will caſt you off. You much miſtake (and thoſe that tell you ſo,) if you think that the ſpirit of Adoption lieth only in a perſwaſion that you are Gods childe, or that you may not have the ſpirit of Adoption without ſuch a perſwaſion of Gods Adopting you. For God may Adopt you, and give you that ſpirit which he gives only to his children, and poſſeſs you with true filial affections towards him, before ever you know your ſelf to be Adopted; much more, though you may have frequent retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning doubts of your Adoption.</p>
               <p>Having thus ſhewed you how far you may expect the Witneſs of the Spirit, and how far you may and muſt make uſe of Marks, and Qualifications or Actions of your own, for the obtaining of Aſſurance and ſetled Peace; I ſhall add an Anſwer to the Principal Objections of the Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians againſt this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> (They ſay) This is to draw men from Chriſt to themſelves, and from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to the Law: to lay their Comforts and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57538:68"/>
build their Peace upon any thing in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, is to forſake Chriſt and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves their own Saviours: and thoſe Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers that perſwade them to this, are Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Law, and falſe Prophets, who draw men from Chriſt to themſelves. All our own Righteouſneſs is as a menſtruous cloth, and our beſt works are ſin, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may not take up our Aſſurance or Comforts from them. We ſhall be alwayes at uncertainties, and at a loſs, or unconſtant, up and down in our Comforts, as long as we take them from any ſignes in our ſelves. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo our own Graces are Imperfect, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unfit to be the Evidences for our Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>

what I have taught you ſo oft, concerning the difference of the Law of Works, and the Law or Covenant of Grace, with their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Conditions. Upon which ſuppoſition I explicate the point thus. 1. No man may look at his own Graces or Duties as his Legal Righteouſneſs; that is, ſuch as for which the Law of Works will pronounce him Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. 2. Nor yet may he take them for part of his Legal Righteouſneſs, in conjunction with Chriſts Righteouſneſs, as the other part: but here we muſt go wholly out of our ſelves, and deny and diſclaim all ſuch Righteouſneſs of our own. We have no Works, which make the Reward to be not of Grace but of Debt, 3. We muſt not once think that our Graces, Duties or ſufferings, can make ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to Gods Juſtice for our ſin and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs: nor yet that they are any part of that ſatisfaction.

                  </gap>es and Duties, ſhall appear in theſe clear Reaſons following, which ſhew alſo the Grounds on which we may do it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Pardon, Juſtification and Adoption,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57538:69"/>
and Salvation, are all Given to us in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel only Conditionally (if we believe:) and the Condition is an act, or rather ſeveral acts of our own. Now till the Condition be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, no man can have any Certainty that the Benefit ſhall be his: nor can he by any other means (ordinarily) be certain of the Benefit, but by that which aſcertaineth him that he hath performed the Condition. God ſaith, <hi>He that Believeth ſhall be ſaved:</hi> No man can know then that he ſhall be ſaved till he firſt know that he Believeth. Elſe he ſhould know either contrary to that which is written, or more then that which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: And Juſtification and Adoption ſhould be given ſome other way then by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Promiſe (for that Promiſe giveth them only Conditionally, and ſo ſuſpendeth the actual right, upon the performance of the Condition:) But if any can ſhew any other way by which God maketh over pardon and Adoption, beſides the Goſpel promiſe, let them do it; but I will not promiſe ſuddenly to believe them; for it was never yet ſhewed as I know of. Alſo, if men muſt not look a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> their own performance of the Condition, to prove their right to the benefit, then eithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> all or none muſt believe that they have tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> right. For the Promiſe ſaith, <hi>He that Believet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſhall be ſaved.</hi> And this is a promiſe of Lif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:57538:69"/>
conditionally to all. If all muſt believe that they ſhall be ſaved, then moſt of the world muſt believe a lye. If the true believer may not therefore conclude that he ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, becauſe he performeth the condition of the promiſe, then no man may believe it. And for that abſolute Promiſe of the new Heart, no man can, or may believe that it is his, till he have that new heart which it promiſeth; that is, till it be fulfilled: For there is no Mark by which a man can know whether that Promiſe belong to him or no, before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand: and if all ſhould believe that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to them, moſt would finde it falſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God hath not Redeemed us by his Son to be Lawleſs: To be without Law is to be without Government. We are without <hi>the Law</hi> (that is, of Works, or of <hi>Moſes,</hi>) but not without <hi>Law</hi>; Jeſus Chriſt is our Ruler, and he hath made us a Law of Grace; an eaſie yoak, and commands that are not grievous. This Law hath Precepts, Promiſes and threats: it muſt needs be either obeyed or diſobeyed: and ſo the paenalty muſt be due or not due; and the Reward due or not due. He that performs the condition, and ſo to whom the reward is due and not the paenal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is Righteous in the ſenſe of this Law. As when we are accuſed to be ſinners againſt the Law of Works, and ſo to deſerve the paenalty
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57538:70"/>
of that Law, we muſt confeſs all, and plead the Righteouſneſs of Chriſts ſatisfaction, for our Juſtification: ſo when we are accuſed to be final unbelievers or impenitent, and ſo not to have performed the conditions of the new Covenant, we muſt be Juſtified by our own Faith and Repentance, the performance of that condition; and muſt plead, Not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And ſo far our own Acts are our Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Righteouſneſs; and that of ſuch neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, that without it no man can have part in Chriſts Righteouſneſs, nor be ſaved. I would deſire any man elſe to tell me, what elſe he will plead at Judgement, when the Accuſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> chargeth him (or if he do ſo charge him) with final unbelief: will he confeſs it, and ſay, <hi>Chriſt hath Believed and Repented for me</hi> that is as much as to ſay, <hi>Chriſt was a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver for Infidels, that he might ſave Infidels</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> All falſe. If he will not ſay thus (and lying will do no good) then muſt he plead his own Believing and Repenting as his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in oppoſition to that Accuſation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And if it be of ſuch uſe then, and be called a hundred times in Scripture, <hi>our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and we Righteous for it, then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we may accordingly try by it now, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſhall then be able to come off and be Juſtified, or no; and ſo may build our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort on it.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:57538:70"/>3. Conſcience is a Witneſs and Judge within us; and doth as under God Accuſe and Condemn, or Excuſe and Acquit: Now if Conſcience muſt abſolve us only ſo far as we are Innocent, or do well, or are qualified with Grace; then it is impoſſible but theſe our Qualifications and Actions ſhould be ſome ground of our Comfort. See <hi>Acts</hi> 24.16. and 23.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15, 16.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thoſe which are our Graces and Works, as we are the Subjects and Agents, are the Graces and Works of God, of Chriſt, of the holy Ghoſt dwelling in us. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may not Rejoice in our own Works, or Graces, then we may not Rejoice in the Works or Guifts of God, Chriſt or the holy Ghoſt. And</p>
               <p n="5">5. Our Graces are the ſpiritual Life or Health of the ſoul, and our holy actions are the vital operations. Now Life and Health are neceſſary Rejoycing, delighting things of themſelves: and vital Actions, are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily pleaſant and delectable.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Our Graces and holy Actions muſt needs Rejoice us in reſpect of their Objects. For the object of our Love, Truſt, Hope, Meditation, Prayer, Conference, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is God himſelf, and the Lord Jeſus, and the Joyes of Heaven. And how can ſuch Actions chooſe but Rejoice us!</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:57538:71"/>7. Yea Rejoicing it ſelf, and Delighting our ſelves in God, is not only one part of our Duty, but that great Duty wherein lieth the height of our Chriſtianity: And how vain a ſpeech is it, to ſay, that we may not take up our Comforts from our own works, nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in any thing of our own; when even Rejoicing it ſelf, and Delighting, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting our ſelves is one part of our Duty?</p>
               <p n="8">8. As God in Chriſt is the chief object and ground of our Comfort (ſo that we muſt Rejoice in nothing but God, and the Croſs of Chriſt, in that kinde, or in coordination with them,) ſo it is the office of every Grace and holy Work, and Ordinance, and Means, to be ſubſervient to Chriſt, either for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Chriſt, or applying his merits, or they are the effects of his merits. Now if we muſt Love and Rejoice in Chriſt principally, then muſt we needs Love and Rejoice in all thoſe things that ſtand in a neceſſary ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to him, in their places. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſay, <hi>We muſt Rejoice in Chriſt only and therefore not in any Graces or Duties of our own</hi>; is as wife as if a wife ſhould caſt her husbands cloathes and meat out of doors, and ſay, You charged me to admit none into my chamber but your ſelf: Or as if a Phyſitian, having told his patients, <hi>I will cure you, if you will truſt me only for the cure</hi>;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57538:71"/>
thereupon the Patients ſhould caſt away his Medicines, and ſhut the doors againſt his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Apothecary and ſay, <hi>We muſt truſt none but the Phyſitian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. All the failings of our Duties are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and they Accepted in Chriſt; and therefore we may Rejoice in them.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Our Duties have a double tendency to our ſalvation: 1. As the Condition to which God hath promiſed it as the Crown and Reward (in a hundred texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;) And may we not Comfort our ſelves in that which God promiſeth Heaven to? 2. As a Natural means to our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and further perfection (as Watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Meditation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tend to deſtroy ſin:) as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to <hi>Timothy, Take heed to thy ſelf and to thy Doctrine, and in ſo doing thou ſhalt both ſave thy ſelf and them that hear the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="11">11. We ſhall be Judged according to our Works: therefore we muſt judge our ſelves according to our Works; and ſo muſt judge our ſtate good or bad according to our works: for can man judge by a righter way then God will? At leaſt is it not lawfull for man to judge as God doth?</p>
               <p n="12">12. We muſt judge of others in probability
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57538:72"/>
according to their external works, even the tree by the fruits: therefore we muſt judge of our ſelves in certainty according to our internal and external works together (which we may certainly know.)</p>
               <p n="13">13. If we may not Rejoice in any of our Graces, then we may not be Thankfull for them: for Thanks is accompanied with Joy: but we muſt be Thankfull.</p>
               <p n="14">14. If we may not Rejoice in our Duties, we may not Repent or ſorrow for the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of them; and if we may not Rejoice in our Graces, we may not lament the want of them (for theſe are as the two ends of the balance, that one goes down when the other goes up; or as day and night, light and darkneſs.) But the conſequent is intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable.</p>
               <p n="15">15. This would overthrow all Religion. For what a man cannot Rejoice in, he cannot Love, he cannot eſteem, regard, be carefull to obtain, be fearfull of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. God delighteth in our Graces and holy Duties, and is well pleaſed with them: and therefore it is lawfull and needfull that we do as God doth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5. <hi>Abels</hi> ſacrifice by faith obtained teſtimony that he pleaſed God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.16. <hi>To do good and to communicate forget not, for with ſuch

               <p n="17">17. The Saints of God have not only tried themſelves by their Graces and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and commanded others to try by them, but have Gloried and Rejoiced in their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and ſufferings, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>This is our Rejoicing, the Teſtimony of our Conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity we have had our converſation among you.</hi> Acts 5.41. <hi>They gloried that they were counted worthy to ſuffer for Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 15.17. <hi>I have therefore whereof I may glory in Jeſus Chriſt, in thoſe things which pertain to God.</hi> Rom. 5.3. <hi>We glory in tribulation,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.6, 9. <hi>Though I ſhould deſire to glory, I ſhould not be a fool: I glory in mine infirmities.</hi> Jer. 9.24. <hi>Let him that glorieth glory in this, that he underſtandeth and knoweth me.</hi> 1 Cor. 9.15. <hi>I had rather die then any ſhould make my glorying void.</hi> Gal. 6.4. <hi>Let every man prove his own work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo ſhall he have Rejoicing in himſelf alone, and not in another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18. Scripture nameth many of our own Graces and Duties, as the certain Marks of our Juſtification and right to Glory: Even Chriſt with his own mouth gives us many: <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.21. <hi>Where your treaſure is, there will your heart be alſo.</hi> Joh. 3.20. <hi>He that doth evil hateth the light,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but he that doth good cometh to the light, that,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.

               <p n="19">19. We may Rejoice in other mens good Works and Graces (and do, if we be true Chriſtians,) therefore in our own.</p>
               <p n="20">20. We may Rejoice in Gods outward Mercies; therefore much more in inward, and ſuch as accompany ſalvation. All theſe Arguments prove that we may take up our Comfort from our own Gracious Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and Actions (not in oppoſition to Chriſt, but in ſubordination to him:) and moſt of them prove that we may fetch our Aſſurance of ſalvation from them, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Evidences thereof.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid the more in Anſwer to theſe Objections, 1. Becauſe never any came with fairer pretences of exalting Chriſt, and maintaining the honour of his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and free Grace, and of denying our ſelves and our own Righteouſneſs. 2. And yet few Doctrines more diſhonour Chriſt, and deſtroy the very ſubſtance of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Even as if a man ſhould cry down him that would Praiſe and commend Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the King, and ſay, You muſt Praiſe nothing but the King: ſo do theſe cry down our looking at and Rejoicing in our Love to Chriſt, and our Thankfulneſs to him, and our Obedience, and all under
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57538:73"/>
pretence of honouring him. Nay they will not have us Rejoice in one part of Chriſts ſalvation (his ſaving us from the power of ſin, and his ſanctifying us,) under pretence that we diſhonour the other part of his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation (his Juſtifying us.) If ever Satan transformed himſelf into an Angel of Light, and his Miniſters into Miniſters of Light, it is in the miſtakes of the Antinomians: and no people in the world (except carnal Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, whom this doctrine fits to a hair) are in more danger of them, then poor doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtians under trouble of Conſcience: ſpecially if they be not judicious, and skill'd in the Doctrine of Chriſt. For the very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of extolling Chriſt and free Grace will take much with ſuch: and any New-way will ſometime ſeem to give them Comfort, upon the very novelty and ſudden change.</p>
               <p>Having thus proved that you may and muſt fetch your ſpecial Comfort and Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from Evidences, and that your firſt Evidence is your Faith, I ſhall open this ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier under the next Direction.</p>

                  <p n="11">11. <hi>In the Trial of your State,</hi> Be ſure that you make uſe of Infallible ſigns of Sincerity, and take not thoſe for certain which are not.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ANd to that end remember what I ſaid before, that you muſt well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand wherein the Nature of ſaving Faith, and ſo of all ſaving Grace doth conſiſt. And when you underſtand this, write it down in two or three lines: and both at your firſt trial, and afterward when ever any doubts do drive you to a Review of your Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſtill have recourſe only to thoſe Signs. and try by them. What theſe Signs are, I have ſhewed you ſo fully in the forecited place in my book of <hi>Reſt,</hi> that I ſhall ſay but little now. Remember that Infallible ſigns are very few; and that whatſoever is made the condition of ſalvation, that is the moſt Infallible evidence of our ſalvation, and therefore the fitteſt Mark to try by: And therefore Faith in God the Father and the Redeemer, is the main Evidence. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have elſewhere ſhewed you, that this
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57538:74"/>
Faith is comprehenſive of Love, Gratitude, Reſolution to Obey and Repentance; let me more particularly open it to help you in the Triall. To prove any Grace to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, it is neceſſary that you prove that ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is fully promiſed to him that hath it. Now if you will know what it is that hath this promiſe; I will tell you, 1. As to the Object. 2. The Act. 3. The degree or modification of the Act. For all theſe three muſt be enquired after if you will get Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. 1. The Object is principally God and the Redeemer Chriſt: And ſecondarily the Benefits given by Chriſt: and under that, the means to attain the principal Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. The Act hath many Names drawn from Reſpective and Modall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in the Object; as Faith, Deſire, Love, chooſing, Accepting, Receiving, Conſenting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But properly all are compriſed in one word, <hi>Willing.</hi> The Underſtandings high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation of God, and Chriſt, and Grace, is a Principal part of true ſaving Grace; but yet it is difficult and ſcarce poſſible to judge of your ſelf by it rightly, but only as it diſcovers it ſelf by prevailing with the Will. 3. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of this Act muſt be ſuch, as ordinarily prevaileth againſt its contrary: I mean, both the contrary Object, and the contrary Act to the ſame Object. But becauſe I doubt
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57538:75"/>
School-termes do obſcure my meaning to you (though they are neceſſary for exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) I will expreſs the nature of ſaving Grace in two or three Marks as plain as I can.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Are you heartily willing to take God for your Portion, and had you rather Live with him in Glory, in his favour and fullest Love, with a ſoul perfectly clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from all ſin, and never more to offend him, Rejoicing with his Saints in his everlaſting praiſes; than to enjoy the delights of the fleſh on earth, in a way of ſin, and without the favour of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Are you heartily willing to take Jeſus Chriſt as he is offered in the Goſpel? that is, to be your only Saviour and Lord, to give you pardon by his bloudſhed, and to ſanctifie you by his Word and Spirit, and to govern you by his Laws?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(Becauſe this General containeth and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth ſeveral Particulars, I will expreſs them diſtinctly.)</p>
               <p>Here it is ſuppoſed that you know this much following of the nature of his Laws: For to be Willing to be Ruled by his Laws in General, and utterly Unwilling when it comes to particulars, is no true Willingneſs or ſubjection. 1. You muſt know that his Laws reach both to heart and outward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. 2. That they command a holy, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57538:75"/>
heavenly life. 3. That they command things ſo croſs and unpleaſing to the fleſh, that the fleſh will be ſtill murmuring and ſtriving againſt obedience: Particularly 1. They command things quite croſs to the <hi>inclinations</hi> of the fleſh: as to forgive Wrongs, to Love Enemies, to forbear Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and Revenge, to reſtrain and mortifie Luſt and Paſſion; to abhor and mortifie Pride, and be low in our own eyes, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and meek in ſpirit. 2. They command things that croſs the <hi>intereſt</hi> of the fleſh and its inclination both together: I mean, which will deprive it of its enjoyments, and bring it to ſome ſuffering: As, to perform Duties e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when they lay us open to diſgrace, and ſhame, and reproach in the world; and to deny our credit, rather then forſake Chriſt or our duty: to obey Chriſt in doing what he commandeth us, though it would hazard or certainly loſe our wealth, friends, liberty and life it ſelf; forſaking all, rather then to forſake him: to give to the poor, and other good uſes, and that liberally according to our abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities: to deny the fleſh all forbidden plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and make not proviſion to ſatisfie its luſts, but to crucifie the fleſh with the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and luſts thereof: and in this combate to hold on to the end and to overcome. Theſe are the Laws of Chriſt; which you
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57538:76"/>
muſt know, before you can determine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are indeed unfeignedly willing to obey them. Put therefore theſe further que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions to your ſelf, for the trial of your wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to be ruled by Chriſt according to his Laws.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Are you heartily willing to live in the performance of thoſe holy and ſpiritual Duties of heart and life, which God hath abſolutely commanded you? and are you heartily ſorry that you perform them no better? with no more cheerfulneſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, ſucceſs and conſtancy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Are you ſo throughly convinced of the worth of everlaſting Happineſs, and the intollerableneſs of everlaſting miſery, and the truth of both, and of the ſoveraignty of God the Father and Christ the Redeemer, and your many engagements to him, and of the neceſſity and good of obeying, and the evil of ſinning; that you are truly willing, that is, have a ſetled reſolution, to cleave t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Doth this willingneſs or reſolution alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſo far prevail in your heart and life, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the Intereſt and Temptations of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57538:76"/>
the world, the devil and your fleſh, that you do ordinarily practiſe, the moſt ſtrict and holy, the moſt ſelf-denying, coſtly and hazardous duties that you know God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of you, and do heartily ſtrive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all known ſin and overcome all groſs ſins, and when you fall under any prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing temptation, do riſe again by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and begging pardon of God through the bloud of Chriſt, do reſolve to watch and reſiſt more carefully for the time to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe five Marks is expreſſed the Goſpel-deſcription of a true Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Having laid down theſe Marks, I muſt needs add a few words for the explaining of ſome things in them, leaſt you miſtake the meaning and ſo loſe the benefit of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Obſerve that it is your <hi>willingneſs</hi> which is the very Point to be tried. And therefore 1. Judge not by your bare knowledge. 2. Judge not by the ſtirrings or paſſionate workings of your Affections. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> pray you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not this Rule in any of your ſelf-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings: It is the heart that God requireth; <hi>My ſon, give me thy heart,</hi> Prov. 23.26. If he hath the Will he hath the heart. He may have much of our Knowledge and not our heart: but when we Know him ſo throughly as to Will him unfeignedly, then he hath our heart. Affectionate workings of ſoul to God
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57538:77"/>
in Chriſt, are ſweet things, and high and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Duties, and ſuch as all Chriſtians ſhould ſtrive for: But they are not the ſafeſt Marks to try our ſtates by: 1. Becauſe there may be a ſolid, ſincere intention and choice in and of the Will, when there is little ſtirring per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Affections. 2. Becauſe the Will is the Maſter, Commanding Faculty of the Rational ſoul; and ſo if it be right that man is upright and ſafe. 3. Becauſe the Paſſions and Affections are ſo mutable and uncertain: The Will can command them but imperfectly; it cannot perfectly Reſtrain them from vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: much leſs can it perfectly raiſe them to that height, as is ſuitable to the excellency of our heavenly objects. But the object it ſelf, with its ſenſible manner of apprehenſion moves them more then all the Command of the Will. And ſo we finde by experience, that a godly man when with his utmoſt private endeavour he cannot command one ſtirring pang of divine Love or Joy in his ſoul, yet upon the hearing of ſome moving Sermon, or the ſudden receiving of ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Mercy, or the reading of ſome quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning book, he ſhall feel perhaps ſome ſtirring of that Affection. So when we cannot weep in private one tear for ſin, yet at a ſtirring Sermon, or when we give vent to our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and eaſe our troubled hearts into the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57538:77"/>
boſome of ſome faithfull friend, then we can finde tears. 4. Becauſe Paſſions and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions depend ſo much on the temperature of the Body: To one they are eaſie, familiar and at command: to another (as honeſt) they are difficult and ſcarce ſtirred at all. With moſt women, and perſons of weaker tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, they are eaſier then with men. Some cannot weep at the death of a friend, though never ſo deer: no nor perhaps feel very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible inward grief: and yet perhaps would have redeemed his life at a far deerer rate (had it been poſſible) then thoſe that can grieve and weep more abundantly. 5. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Worldly things have ſo great an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage on our Paſſions and Affections. 1. They are ſenſible and neer us, and our knowledge of them is clear: But God is not to be ſeen, heard or felt by our ſenſes: he is far from us, though locally preſent with us: we are capable of knowing but little, very little of him. 2. Earthly things are <hi>alway</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes; their advantage is continuall. 3. Earthly things being ſtill the objects of our ſenſes, do force our Paſſions, whether we will or not: though they cannot force our Wills. 6. Becauſe Affections and Paſſions riſe and fall, and neither are nor can be in any even and conſtant frame: and therefore are unfit to be the conſtant or certain evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57538:78"/>
of our ſtate: But the Wills Reſolution and Choice may be more conſtant. So that I adviſe you rather to try your ſelf by your Will, then by your Paſſionate ſtirrings of Love or longing, of Joy or ſorrow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But doth not Scripture lay as much on Love, as on any Grace? and doth not Chriſt ſay, that except we Love him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, we cannot be his Diſciples?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Its all very true. But conſider, Love hath two parts; the one in the Will, which is commonly called, a faculty of the ſoul as Rational; and this is the ſame thing that I call <hi>Willing,</hi> Accepting, Chooſing or Conſenting: this Complacency is true Love to Chriſt; and this is the ſure ſtanding Mark. The other is the Paſſionate part, commonly ſaid to be in the ſoul as ſenſitive; and this, though moſt commonly called Love, yet is, leſs certain and conſtant, and ſo unfitter to try your ſtate by; though a great duty ſo far as we can reach it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You muſt underſtand and well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that it is not every <hi>willingneſs</hi> that will prove your ſincerity. For wicked men may have ſlight apprehenſions of ſpiritual things, which may produce ſome ſlight deſires and wiſhes, which yet are ſo feeble and heartleſs, that every luſt and carnal deſire overcomes them: And it will not ſo much as enable them
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57538:78"/>
to deny the groſſeſt ſin. But it muſt be the Prevalent part of your Will that God muſt have: I mean, a greater ſhare, a deeper and larger room then any thing in the world. That is, you muſt have a higher eſtimation of God, and everlaſting happineſs, and Chriſt and a holy life, then of any thing in the world: and alſo your Will muſt be ſo diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed hereby and inclined to God, that if God and Glory to be obtained through Chriſt by a holy ſelf-denying life, were ſet before you on the one hand; and the Pleaſure, Profits and Honours of the world, to be enjoyed in a way of ſin, on the other hand; you would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvedly take the former and refuſe the later. Indeed they are thus ſet before you: and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your choice dependeth your ſalvation or damnation (though that Choice muſt come from the Grace of God.)</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet muſt you well remember, that this Willingneſs and Choice is ſtill imperfect: and therefore when I mention <hi>a hearty willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> I mean not <hi>a perfect willingneſs.</hi> There may be and is in the moſt gracious ſouls on earth, much undiſpoſedneſs, backwardneſs and withdrawing of heart, which is too great a meaſure of unwillingneſs to duty. Eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thoſe duties which the fleſh is moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe from, and which require moſt of God and his Spirit to the right performance of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:57538:79"/>Among all Duties, I think the ſoul is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally moſt backward to theſe following: 1. To ſecret Prayer: becauſe it is ſpiritual, and requires great reverence, and hath nothing of external pomp or form to take us up with, and conſiſteth not much in the exerciſe of common gifts, but in the exerciſe of ſpecial Grace, and the breathings of the Spirit, and ſearchings, pantings and ſtrivings of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſoul towards God. (I do not ſpeak of the heartleſs repeating of bare words, learned by rote, and either not underſtood, or not uttered from the feeling of the ſoul.) 2. To ſerious Meditation, alſo is the ſoul very back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: that is, either to meditate on God, and the promiſed Glory, or any ſpiritual ſubject, to this end, that the heart may be thereby quickned and raiſed, and graces exerciſed: (though to meditate on the ſame ſubject, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to know or diſpute on it, the heart is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing neer ſo backward.) Or elſe to meditate on the ſtate of our own hearts, by way of ſelf-examination, or ſelf-judging, or ſelf-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, or ſelf-exciting. 3. Alſo to the Duty of faithfull dealing with each others ſouls, in ſecret reproof and exhortation, plainly (though lovingly) to tell each other of our ſins and danger, to this the heart is uſually very backward; partly through a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full baſhfulneſs, partly for want of more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57538:79"/>
lively apprehenſions of our duty and our brothers danger, and partly becauſe we are loath to diſpleaſe men and loſe their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; it being grown ſo common for men to fall out with thoſe (if not hate them) that de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l plainly and faithfully with them. 4. Alſo to Take a Reproof, as well as to Give it, the heart is very backward: Even godly men (through the ſad remainders of their ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,) do too commonly frown, and ſnarle, and retort our reproofs, and ſtudy preſently how to excuſe themſelves and put it by, or how to charge us with ſomething that may ſtop our mouthes, and make the reprover ſeem as bad as themſelves: Though they dare not tread our reproofs under feet, and turn again and all to rent us, yet they oft ſhew the remnants of a dogged nature, though when they review their waies, it coſts them ſorrow. We muſt ſugar and butter our words, and make them liker to ſtroaking then ſtriking, liker an approving then a reproving them, liker flattery then faithfull dealing, and yet when we have all done, they go down very hardly, and that but half way, even with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny godly people when they are under a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation. 5. The like may be ſaid of all thoſe Duties which do pinch upon our credit or profit, or tend to diſgrace us or impoveriſh us in the world: As the confeſſing of a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefull
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57538:80"/>
fault: the free Giving to the poor or ſacred uſes, according to our eſtates: the parting with our own Right or Gain for Peace: the patient ſuffering of wrong, and forgiving it heartily: and loving bitter abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive enemies: eſpecially the running upon the ſtream of mens diſpleaſure, and incurring the danger of being utterly undone in our worldly ſtate (eſpecially if men be rich: who do therefore as hardly get to Heaven as a Camel through a needles eye:) and above all, the laying down of our lives for Chriſt: It cannot be expected, that godly men ſhould perform all theſe with perfect Willingneſs: The fleſh will play its part, in pleading its own cauſe; and will ſtrive hard to maintain its own intereſt: O the ſhifts, the ſubtill argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or at leaſt the clamorous and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate contradictions that all theſe Duties will meet with in the beſt, ſo far as they are unrenewed, and their Graces weak! ſo that you may well hence conclude that you are a ſinner; but you may not conclude that you are Graceleſs, becauſe of a backwardneſs and ſome unwillingneſs to Duty.</p>
               <p>Yet your Willingneſs muſt be greater then your unwillingneſs; and ſo Chriſt muſt have the prevailing part of your will; and from that the denomination is uſually taken ſo that Scripture uſeth to affirm Gods people
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57538:80"/>
to be willing, even when they fail in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. So <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. 7.18. ſaith, <hi>To will is preſent with me, when how to do or perform he found not:</hi> that is, not to obey ſo perfectly as he would do: not to love God ſo intenſly and fervently; not to ſubdue paſſions and luſts ſo throughly; not to watch our thoughts, and words, and waies ſo narrowly, and order them ſo exactly as the bent of his will did conſent to. And leſt any Arminian ſhould pretend (as they do) that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks here in the perſon of an unregenerate man, as under the convictions of the Law, and not as a man regenerate; it is plain in the text that he ſpeaks of himſelf in the ſtate which he was then in, and that ſtate was a regenerate ſtate: He expreſly ſaith, It is thus and thus with me; <hi>So then I my ſelf with my minde do ſerve the Law of God: but with my fleſh the Law of ſin, ver.</hi> 25. And to put it out of doubt, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks the like of all Chriſtians, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>For the fleſh luſteth againſt the spirit, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is but diſſembling, if I ſhould ſay, I am <hi>willing</hi> to perform the ſtricteſt, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt Duties, and yet do not perform them. To ſay, I am willing to Pray, and Pray not: or to Give to the poor, and yet Give not: or to perform the moſt ſelf-denying coſtly Duties, and yet when it ſhould come to the Practiſe, I will not be perſwaded or drawn to them? I will not confeſs a diſgracefull ſin; nor further a good Cauſe to my danger, coſt or trouble; nor reprove, nor ſubmit to reproof; nor turn from the way of temptations, or the like. Action muſt diſcover true Willingneſs. The ſon that ſaid to his father, <hi>I go Sir,</hi> but went not to labour in the vineyard, was not Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted or Juſtified. If therefore you are in doubt whether your Willingneſs be ſincere, enquire into your practice and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. God commandeth you to Pray, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct your family, to be Mercifull to the poor, to forgive thoſe that wrong you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The fleſh and the Devil perſwade you from theſe. Do you perform them, or do you not? Though you may do it with backwardneſs, and dullneſs, and weakneſs, yet do you Do it? and deſire you could do it better? and lament your miſdoing it? and <hi>endeavour</hi> to Do it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57538:81"/>
then you have formerly done? This ſhews then that the ſpirit prevaileth, though the fleſh do contradict it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Yet here you muſt carefully diſtinguiſh of Duties: For God hath made ſome to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary parts of the condition of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and ſo of flat neceſſity for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our Juſtification, and for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Glorification: Such are confeſſing Chriſt before men when we are called to it; confeſſing ſin; Praying; ſhewing Mercy to the poor; forgiving wrongs; hearing and yielding to Gods Word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſtill ſuppoſing that there be opportunity and neceſſaries for the performance of theſe. But ſome d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties there are that God hath not laid ſo great a ſtreſs or neceſſity on: though yet the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full reſolved omiſſion in ordinary, of any known duty, is contrary to the nature of true Obedience.</p>
               <p>Alſo, the Caſe may much differ with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral perſons, places and ſeaſons, concerning Duty: that may be a Duty to one man that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> not to another; and in one place, which is not in another; and at one ſeaſon, which is not at another. And that may be a greater duty, and of indiſpenſable neceſſity to one, which to another is not ſo great. It may ſtand with true Grace, to omit that duty which men know not to be a duty, or not to be ſo to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57538:82"/>
them (except where the duty is ſuch as is it ſelf of abſolute neeeſſity to ſalvation:) but it cannot ſo ſtand with Grace in thoſe that know it, ordinarily to reject it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Alſo you muſt underſtand, that when I ſay, that true Willingneſs to be Ruled by Chriſt, will ſhew it ſelf in Actual Obedience; I do not mean it of every particular indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Act which is our Duty, as if you ſhould judge your ſelf Graceleſs for every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar omiſſion of a duty: no, though you knew it to be a duty: and though you conſidered it to be a duty. For 1. There may be a true Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituated Inclination and Willingneſs to obey Chriſt rooted in the heart, when yet by the force of a temptation, the actual prevalency of it at that time in that act may be hindered and ſuppreſt. 2. And at the ſame time, you do hold on in a courſe of obedience in other duties, 3. And when the temptation is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and Grace hath been rowſed up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fleſh, and you ſoberly recollect your thoughts, you will return to Obedience in that duty alſo.

Yet ſuc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="7">7. I know the fourth Mark, about forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king All for Chriſt, may ſeem ſomewhat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable and harſh to propound for the quieting of a troubled conſcience. But yet, I durſt not omit it, ſeeing Chriſt hath not omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it; nay ſeeing he hath ſo urged it, and laid ſuch a ſtreſs on it in the Scripture as he hath done; dare not dawb, nor be unfaithfull, for fear of troubling: ſuch skinning over the wound, will but prepare for more trouble &amp; a further cure. Chriſt thought it meet even to tell young beginners of the worſt (though it might poſſibly diſcourage them, and did turn ſome back (that they might not come to him upon miſtaken expectations: and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth all that will be Chriſtians and he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to count their coſt before hand, and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon what it will ſtand them in to be Chriſts Diſciples; and if they cannot undergo his termes (that is, to deny themſelves, take up their Croſs, forſake all and follow him) they cannot be his Diſciples. And Chriſt had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they knew it before hand, then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves, or to turn back when they meet with what they never thought of, and then to imagin that Chriſt had deceived them &amp; drawn them in, and done the wrong.</p>
               <p n="8">8. When I ſay in the fourth Mark, that you muſt have <hi>a ſetled Reſolution,</hi> I mean the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57538:83"/>
ſame thing as before I did by <hi>hearty willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> But it is meeter here to call it <hi>Reſolution,</hi> becauſe this is the proper name for that act of the Will, which is <hi>a determination of it ſelf upon d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Chriſt ſeeks for your heart on one ſide, and the World with its pleaſures, profits and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours on the other ſide: The ſoul which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſideration of both, doth prefer Chriſt in his choice, and reject the world (as it is competitor with him) and this not doubting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and with reſervation for further delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or trial, but preſently paſſeth his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent for better and worſe, this is ſaid to be <hi>a Reſolving.</hi> And I know no one word that more fitly expreſſeth the nature of that Grace, which differenceth a true Chriſtian from all hypocrites, and by which a man may ſafely judge of his eſtate.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Yet I here add, that it muſt be <hi>a ſetled Reſolution:</hi> And that to intimate, that it muſt be a Habituated Willingneſs or Reſolution. The Prevalency of Chriſts Intereſt in the ſoul muſt be a Habitual Prevalency. If a man that is terrified by a rowſing Sermon, or that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th in expectation of preſent death, ſhould
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57538:83"/>
actually Reſolve to forſake ſin, or perform duty; without any further change of minde, or habit, or fixedneſs of this Reſolution, it would be of no great value, and ſoon extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed. Though yet I believe that no unſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified man doth ever attain to that full Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution for Chriſt, which hath a complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Chriſt accompanying it, and which may be termed, the Prevailing part of the Will: Thoſe that ſeem Reſolved to day to be for Chriſt, and to deny the world and the fleſh, and the next day are unreſolved again, have cauſe to ſuſpect that they were never truly Reſolved. Though the Will of a godly man may lye under declinings in the degrees of Reſolution, yet Chriſt hath alwaies his Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Reſolutions, and uſually his Actual in a prevalent degree.</p>
               <p n="10">10. I add alſo the Grounds (in the fourth Mark) on which this Reſolution muſt be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. For falſe Grounds in the Underſtanding will not bear up a true Reſolution in the Will. And therefore we put the Articles of our Creed, before our Profeſſion of Conſent and Obedience. Sound Doctrine, and ſound Belief of it, breeds a ſound Reſolution, and makes a ſound heart and life. If a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to obey Chriſt, upon a conceit that Chriſt will never put him upon any ſuffering (elſe he would not reſolve it,) and that he
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57538:84"/>
will give him ſuch bruitiſh pleaſures when he is dead as <hi>Mahomet</hi> hath promiſed to his diſciples, this Reſoution were not ſound: yet in many leſſer points of Doctrine a true Chriſtian may be unſound, and yet ſoundly cleave to the foundation. He may build hay and ſtubble poſſibly: but the foundation muſt be held.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Obſerve well (leſt you miſtake me) that I ſpeak only of the Neceſſity of your preſent Reſolving to forſake all for Chriſt, if he call you to it; but I ſpeak not of your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Promiſe or Prediction that eventual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you ſhall not deny or forſake him. You may be uncertain how you ſhall be upheld in a day of trial, and yet you may now be Reſolved or fully Purpoſed in your own minde what to do. To ſay, <hi>I will not conſent, purpoſe or reſolve, unleſs I were certain to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form my Reſolutions, and not to flag or change again</hi>; this is but to ſay, I will be no Chriſtian unleſs I were ſure to perſevere. I will not be married to Chriſt, leſt I ſhould be drawn to break my covenant with him.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Alſo obſerve, that when I ſpeak of your <hi>reſolving</hi> to forſake all for Chriſt, it is not to caſt away your ſtate or life, but to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to his diſpoſe, and to relinquiſh it only in caſe that he command you ſo.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And I do not intend that you ſhould
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57538:84"/>
be able thus to Reſolve of your ſelf without the ſpecial Grace of God; nor yet without it to continue thoſe Reſolutions; much leſs to perform them by actual ſuffering.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But I cannot be ſure that God will give me Grace to perſevere, or at leaſt not to deny him as <hi>Peter</hi> did; and therefore I ſhould neither Promiſe nor Reſolve what I cannot be certain to perform?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I ſuppoſe you have read the many Scriptures and Arguments which our Divines ordinarily uſe to prove that the true Believers ſhall not fall quite away. And I know not how the oppoſers can anſwer that text which themſelves uſe to alledge for the contrary, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.6, 21. Thoſe that believe for a time, and in the time of perſecution fall away, it is becauſe the ſeed had not depth of earth, the word never took rooting in their hearts. Whence it ſeems that it may be well inferred, that thoſe ſhall not fall away in time of temptation, in whom the word of God hath taken deep rooting. And that is, in them <hi>in whoſe hearts or wills Chriſt hath a ſtronger intereſt then the creature,</hi> or <hi>thoſe that have a well-grounded, unreſerved, habituated or ſetled Reſolution to be for Chriſt.</hi> 2. However, your preſent Reſolution and your Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting with Chriſt is no more but this; to ſay, <hi>I do Conſent: or, this I am Reſolved to do by
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57538:85"/>
the help of Gods Grace.</hi> 3. Elſe no man ſhould be Baptized or become a Chriſtian, becauſe he is uncertain to keep his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants: For all that are Baptized, do Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and vow, <hi>to forſake the world, fleſh and Devil, and fight under Chriſts banner to their lives end.</hi> Underſtand me therefore, that you are not to promiſe to do this by your own ſtrength, but by the ſtrength of Chriſt, as knowing that he hath promiſed his Spirit and Grace for the aid of every true Believer.</p>
               <p n="14">14. If your Reſolution at preſent be hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, you ought not to vex and diſquiet your minde with doubtfull tormenting fears, what you ſhould do, if you be put to it, to forſake all, and ſuffer death for Chriſt. For he hath promiſed to lay no more on us then we can bear, but with the temptation will make us a way to come forth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10, 13. either he will not bring us into trials beyond our ſtrength; or elſe he will increaſe our ſtrength according to our trials. He hath bid us pray, <hi>Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil:</hi> and he hath promiſed, <hi>that whatſoever we ask in the name of Chriſt according to his will he will give us.</hi> So that if once you can but truly ſay, that it is your full Reſolution to forſake all for Chriſt if he call you to it, and that on the forementioned grounds, you ought not then to vex your ſoul with fears
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57538:85"/>
of the iſſue: for that is but to diſtruſt God your father and your ſtrength. Only you muſt be carefull to do your duty to the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of your preſent Reſolutions, and to wait obediently on God for the help of his Spirit, and to beg it earneſtly at his hands.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Much leſs, is it lawfull for men to feign and ſuppoſe ſuch calamities to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as God doth never try men by, and then to ask themſelves, Can I bear theſe for Chriſt? and ſo to try themſelves on falſe and dangerous grounds. Some uſe to be troubled, leſt if they were put to long and exquiſite torments for Chriſt they ſhould renounce him. One ſaith, I cannot endure the torments of Hell for Chriſt: Another ſaith, Could I endure to be roaſted or torn in pieces ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny weeks or daies together? or could I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to die ſo many times over? Theſe are fooliſh, ſinfull queſtions, which Chriſt never deſired you to put to your ſelves. He never tries mens faith on this manner. Tormentors cannot go beyond his Will. Nay it is but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few that he tries by death: and fewer by an extream tormenting death. All this therefore proceeds from errour.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Obſerve, from the fifth Mark, That the preſent Prevalency of your Reſolutions now againſt thoſe Temptations which you encounter with, may well encourage you to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57538:86"/>
expect that they ſhould prevail hereafter, if God bring you into greater trials. Can you now follow Chriſt in a holy life, though your fleſh repine and would have its liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and pleaſures, and though the world de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride or threaten you, or great ones turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you and threaten your undoing? Can you part with your money to the poor, or to the promoting of any work of Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure of eſtate that God hath allotted you, notwithſtanding all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations to the contrary? Some trials you have now: if you can go well through theſe, you have no cauſe to diſquiet your minde with fears of falling in greater trials. But he that cannot now deny his greedy Appetite in meats and drinks ſo far as to forbear exceſs; nor can deny his credit with men, nor bear the ſcorns or frowns of the world, but be on the ſtronger ſide, and decline his duty to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void danger, whatever become of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or Gods favour; this man is not like to forſake and lay down his life for Chriſt and his cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But though I break through leſſer trials, I am not ſure to overcome in greater: for the ſame meaſure of Grace will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a man to forſake All, which will enable him to forſake a little. Many have gone through ſmaller trials, and after forſaken
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57538:86"/>
Chriſt in greater: And Chriſt makes it the property of temporaries that are not rooted in the faith, that they fall when tribulation and perſecution for the Goſpel ariſeth: and therefore it ſeems they may ſtand till then: and if trial never come, they may never fall, and yet be unſound in the mean time?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If your trial now be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, the truth of Grace may be manifeſted in it, though it be none of the greateſt, and though in ſtriving againſt ſin you have not yet reſiſted unto bloud. 2. If you carefully obſerve your own heart, you may diſcern whether the ſpirit and your reſolutions be prevalent, by their daily ſubduing and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the fleſh and its luſts. Nay let me tell you, the Victory of Gods Spirit over the flattering, enticing world in proſperity, is as great and glorious, if not more, then that over the frowning, perſecuting world in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity. And therefore finde the one, and you need not fear the other. Though I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that hypocrites do not fall ſo viſibly and ſhamefully alwayes in proſperity as in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity: for they have more pretences, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages and carnal ſhifts to hide the ſhame of their falls. And for that in the Parable in <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. I pray you mark one thing: Chriſt ſeems to ſpeak of every ſeveral ſort of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers by a Gradation, ſpeaking laſt of thoſe

that go fartheſt. The firſt ſort are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, ignorant, negligent Hearers, in whom the word takes no root at all. The ſecond ſort are thoſe that give it a ſlight and ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low rooting, but no deep rooting at all: theſe are they that fall away in tribulation. By <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away,</hi> is meant the plain deſerting Chriſt or the ſubſtance of his Cauſe. Theſe men till this falling away, though they profeſſed Chriſt, and heard the word with joy, yet no doubt, did not crucifie the fleſh &amp; the world: whereby they might have diſcovered their unſoundneſs if they would, before tribulation came: Firſt, By diſcerning that the Word was not deep rooted, 1. In their Judgement and Eſtimation, 2. Or in their Wills and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Reſolution. Secondly, And by diſcerning the unmortified luſts of their hearts in the mean time. But it ſeems the third ſort of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers likened to the <hi>thorny ground,</hi> went fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then theſe: for here it is only ſaid by <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.14. <hi>that they bring no fruit to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:</hi> However, whether theſe went farther then the other, or not, it is certain that theſe alſo had their trial and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ell in the trial: The deceitfullneſs of riches overturned theſe, as the heat of perſecution overturned the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So that it is evident that proſperity puts faith to the trial, as well as adverſity. But mark the different manner of their falls and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57538:87"/>
overthrowes: They that are overthrown by adverſity, are ſaid <hi>to fall away,</hi> that is, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake Chriſt openly: but they that fall by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, are not ſaid to fall away; but only that <hi>the deceitfullneſs of riches and cares of the world choak the word, ſo that it becomes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull, that is, brings no fruit to perfection.</hi> For uſually theſe do not openly forſake Chriſt, but continue oft an unfruitfull and hypocriticall profeſſion; inſomuch that at that very time when the Word is choaked and fruitleſs, yet the blade of profeſſion may be as green as ever, and they may be ſo much in ſome duties, and have ſuch golden words, and wity ſhifts to plead for every covetous practice, and put ſo fair a gloſs on all their actions, that they may keep up the credit of being very eminent Chriſtians. So that if your Grace can carry you well through proſperity, you may be confident of the truth of it. 3. And then if it be thus proved true and ſaving, you have cauſe to be confident that it will hold out in adverſity alſo, and cauſe you to overcome the ſhake of tribulation. I think moſt men are better in adverſity than in proſperity: though I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs no adverſity is ſo ſhaking, as that which leaves it in a mans choice to come out of it by ſinning: As for a man in health to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, and the perſecutor to ſay, If thou
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57538:88"/>
wilt turn to my ſide and way I will give thee thy life and preferment with it: But ſickneſs or other ſufferings impoſed only by God, and which only God can take off, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo ſhaking. For as the former drawes us to pleaſe men that <hi>they</hi> may deliver us, ſo this drawes even the wicked to think of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God, that <hi>He</hi> may deliver them.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Obſerve that when I ask <hi>whether this Reſolution do already prevail,</hi> I do not mean any perfect prevailing: nay ſin may prevail to draw you to a particular act (and how many, I will not undertake to tell you:) and yet ſtill Grace and the Spirit do conquer in the main. For you will ſay, that General and Army get the victory who vanquiſh the other and win the field, though yet perhaps a Troop or Regiment may be routed, and many ſlain.</p>

               <p>And thus I have given you ſuch Marks as you may ſafely try your ſelf by, and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the meaning of them to you. Now let me adviſe you to this uſe of them. 1. In your ſerious ſelf-examination, try only by theſe, and not by any uncertain Marks. I know there be promiſes of Life made to ſome particular duties and ſingle qualifications in Scripture, as to Humility, Meekneſs, Almes-deeds, Love to the Godly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but it is ſtill both on ſuppoſition that they be not ſingle in the perſon, but are accompanied with,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57538:89"/>
and flow from that faith and love to God beforementioned; and alſo that they are in a prevailing degree.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When ever any freſh doubtings ariſe in you, upon the ſtirrings of corruption, or debility of Graces, ſtill have recourſe to theſe former Marks; and while you finde theſe, let not any thing cauſe you to paſs wrong judgements on your ſelf. Lay theſe now to your own heart, and tell me, <hi>Are you not unfeignedly willing to have Chriſt on the termes that he is offered? Are you not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be more holy? and beg of him to make you ſo? Would you not be glad if your ſoul were more perfectly ſanctified and rid of that body of ſin, though it were to the ſmart and diſpleaſing of your fleſh? Are you not willing to wait on God in the uſe of his Ordinances, in that poor weak meaſure as you are able to perform them? Durſt you or would you quit your part in God, Heaven, Chriſt, and forſake the way of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and do as the prophane world doth, though it were to pleaſe your fleſh or ſave your ſtate or life? Do not you daily ſtrive againſt the fleſh, and keep it under, and deny it its deſires? Do you not deny the world when it would hinder you from works of Mercy or publique Good, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your ability? Is it not the grief of your ſoul when you fall? and your greateſt trouble that you cannot walk more obediently,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57538:90"/>
innocently and fruitfully? and do you not after ſinning Reſolve to be more watchfull for the time to come? Are you not reſolved to ſtick to Chriſt and his holy Laws and Waies, whatever changes or dangers come? and rather to forſake friends and all that you have, then to forſake him? Yet in a godly jealouſie and diſtruſt of your own heart, do renounce your own ſtrength, and reſolve to do this only in the ſtrength of Chriſt? and therefore daily beg it of him? Is it not your daily care and buſineſs to pleaſe God, and do his will, and avoid ſinning in your weak meaſure?</hi> I hope that all this is ſo, and your own caſe; which if it be you have Infallible Evidences, and want but the ſight and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of them: You have the true grounds for Aſſurance, though you want Aſſurance it ſelf: Your chief danger is over, though your trouble remain. Your ſoul is at the preſent in a ſafe condition, though not in the ſenſe of it: You are in the ſtate of ſalvation, though not of conſolation. It muſt be your next work therefore to ſtudy Gods Mercies, and take notice what he hath done for your ſoul. Let not ſo bleſſed a gueſt as the holy Ghoſt dwell in you unobſerved. Shall he do ſuch wonders in you and for you, and you not know it, or acknowledge it? Shall he new beget you, and new make you, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a ſpiritual, heavenly nature in you, who
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57538:90"/>
of your ſelf were ſo carnal and earthly, and will you not obſerve it? Had you any of theſe holy deſires, endeavors or reſolutions of your ſelf by nature? Or have the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about you any of them? O that you knew what a Work of wonderfull Mercy, Wiſdom and Power the Spirit performeth in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of a ſoul? then ſure you would more obſerve and admire his Love to you herein!</p>

               <p n="2">2. By <hi>the ſmalleſt degree of Grace,</hi> I mean, of Faith, Love, Obedience and thoſe ſaving Graces whoſe acts are the condition of our Salvation, and which in the fore-expreſſed Marks I laid down to you. Do not therefore ſo farre miſtake me, as to think that I ſpeak of a ſmall meaſure of thoſe common Gifts which are ſeparable from true Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſuch as are extenſive Knowledge, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, Ability of Utterance in Preaching, Repeating, Exhorting or Praying; An or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, plauſible winning deportment before men, ſuch as is commonly called Good bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or Manners; An affected humble, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementall familiarity and condeſcenſion, to creep into mens eſtimation and affections, and ſteal their hearts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Many a one that is ſtrong in ſaving Grace, is weak in all theſe, and other the like.</p>
               <p>Now for my Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I conceive that it is not poſſible for any Miniſter punctually to ſet down a diſcerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble difference between the leaſt meaſure of True ſaving Grace, and the higheſt degree
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57538:91"/>
of common Grace; and to ſay, Juſt here it is that they part, or by this you may diſcern them. I do but ſay, I think ſo, becauſe other men may know farre more then I do: But I will ſay it as certain, that I am not able to do it, for my own part. This much I can tell, that the leaſt degree of Grace that is ſaving doth determine the ſoul for God and Chriſt, againſt the world and fleſh that ſtand as Competitors; and ſo where Chriſts intereſt prevaileth in the leaſt meaſure, there is the leaſt meaſure of ſaving Grace: As when you are weighing two things in the balance, and at laſt make it ſo near evenweight, that one end is turned and no more: ſo when you are conſidering whether to be for Chriſt or for the fleſh and the world, and your Will is but even a very little Determined to Chriſt, and preferreth him; this is the leaſt meaſure of ſaving Grace. But then how a poor ſoul ſhould diſcern this prevalent choice and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of it ſelf, is all the Queſtion. For there is nothing more eaſie and common then for men to think verily, that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre Chriſt above the creature, as long as no temptation doth aſſault them, nor ſenſual objects ſtand up in any coſiderable ſtrength to entice them: Nay wicked men do truly, oft times, purpoſe to obey Chriſt before the fleſh, and to take him for their Lord, meerly
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57538:92"/>
in the general, when they do not know or conſider the quality of his Laws; that they are ſo ſtrict and ſpiritual and contrary to the fleſh, and hazardous to their worldly hopes and ſeeming-happineſs: But when it comes to particulars, and God ſaith, <hi>Now deny thy ſelf, and thy friend, and thy goods, and thy life for my ſake,</hi> alas, it was never his Reſolution to do it; nor will he be perſwaded to it. But he that ſaid to God who ſends him to labour in his Vineyard, <hi>I go Sir,</hi> when he comes to finde the unpleaſingneſs of the Work, he goes not, or never ſets a hand to it. So that it is evident that it is no true ſaving Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Willingneſs, which prevaileth not for actual Obedience. Now here comes in the unreſolvable Doubt, What is the leaſt Meaſure of Obedience that will prove a man truly Willing and Reſolved, or to have truly Accepted of Chriſt for his Lord? This obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience lieth in Performing what is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and Avoiding what is forbidden. Now it is too certain that every true Believer is guilty of a frequent neglect of Duty, yea of known Duty: We know we ſhould Love God more abundantly, and Delight in him, and Meditate more on him, and Pray more oft and earneſtly then we do, and inſtruct our Families more diligently, and ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin more boldly, and admoniſh our
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57538:92"/>
neighbours more faithfully, with many the like: <hi>The good that we would do we do not, Rom.</hi> 7.19. Nay the fleſh ſo ſtriveth againſt the Spirit, that we <hi>cannot do the good we would. Gal.</hi> 5.17. Nay many a true Chriſtian in time of temptation hath been drawn to omit ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret prayer, or family duties almoſt wholly for a certain ſpace of time: yea and perhaps to be ſo corrupted in his judgement for a time, as to think he doth well in it, as alſo in forbearing praiſing God by Pſalmes, Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Sacraments, and Communicating with the Church, hearing the Word pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (for what duty almoſt is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied of late?) and perhaps may not only o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Relieving the poor for a time, but excuſe it. Now what man can punctually determine juſt how often a true Chriſtian may be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of any ſuch omiſſion? and juſt how long he may continue it? and what the duties be which he may poſſibly ſo omit, and what not?</p>
               <p>So alſo in ſins of Commiſſion: Alas, what ſins did <hi>Noah, Lot, David, Solomon, Aſa, Peter, &amp;c.</hi> commit? If we ſhould ſay as the Papiſts and Arminians, that theſe being mortal ſins, do for the time, till Repentance reſtore him, caſt a true Chriſtian out of Gods favour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſtate of Damnation; then what man breathing is able to enumerate thoſe Mortal
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57538:93"/>
ſins? and tell us which be ſo Damning, and which not? Nay if he could ſay, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is one, and Gluttony another; Who can ſet the punctual ſtint, and ſay, Juſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bits a man muſt eat before he be a Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton: or Juſt ſo much he muſt drink before he be a Drunkard? or by ſuch a ſigne the turning point may be certainly known? We may have ſignes by which he may be tried at the Barre of Man; but theſe are none of them taken from that ſmalleſt degree, which ſpecifieth and denominates the ſinne before God. If we avoid the foreſaid opinion, that one ſuch ſin doth bring us into the ſtate of Damnation, yet is the difficulty never the leſs: For it is certain, that <hi>he that commits ſin is of the Devil,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.8. and there are ſpots which are not the ſpots of Gods children: and all true faith will mortifie the world to us and us to it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. and <hi>he that is in Chriſt hath crucified the fleſh with the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and luſts thereof,</hi> Gal. 5.24. and that <hi>if we live after the fleſh we ſhall die.</hi> Rom. 8.13. and <hi>his ſervants we are to whom we obey, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſin unto death, or of obedience unto Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 6.16. and <hi>if we delight in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity or regard it God will not hear our prayers, Pſal.</hi> 66.18. and that <hi>he that nameth the name of Chriſt muſt depart from iniquity,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.19. and that <hi>God will judge all men according
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57538:93"/>
to their works,</hi> and bid the workers of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty depart from him, <hi>Mat.</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.23. Now can any man on earth tell us juſt how great or how often ſinning will ſtand with true Grace, and how much will not? who can finde thoſe punctual bounds in the Word of God? I conclude therefore, that no Miniſter, or at leaſt, none who is no wiſer then I am, can give a true diſcernable difference between the worſt of Saints and the beſt of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified, or the weakeſt degree of true Grace, and the higheſt of common Grace; and ſo to help ſuch weak Chriſtians to true Aſſurance of their ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But as this is impoſſible to be declared by the Teachers, ſo much more is it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be diſcerned by the perſons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (yea though it could poſſibly be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him:) and that for theſe Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the nature of the thing. Small things are hardly diſcerned. A little is next to none. 2. From the great darkneſs of mans underſtanding, and his unacquaintedneſs with himſelf (both the nature, faculties and motions of his ſoul naturally conſidered, and the moral ſtate, diſpoſitions and motions of it;) and is it likely that ſo blinde an eye can diſcern the ſmalleſt thing, and that in ſo ſtrange and dark a place? every purblind man cannot ſee an atome, or a pin, eſpecially
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57538:94"/>
in the dark. 3. The heart is deceitfull above all things as well as dark; full of ſeemings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> counterfeits and falſe pretences: And a childe in Grace is not able to diſcover its juglings, and underſtand a book where almoſt every word is aequivocall or myſterious. 4. The heart is moſt confuſed, as well as dark and deceitfull: It is like a houſe or ſhop of tools, where all things are thrown together on a heap, and nothing keeps its own place: There are ſuch multiplicity of cogitations, phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies and paſſions, and ſuch irregular thron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in of them, and ſuch a confuſed rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and operation of objects and conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, that it is a wonderfull difficult thing for the beſt Chriſtian to diſcern clearly the bent and actions, and ſo the ſtate of his own ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>. For in ſuch a crowd of cogitations and paſſions, we are like men in a Fair or crowd of people, where a confuſed noiſe may be heard, but you cannot well perceive what any of them ſay, except either ſome one neer you, that ſpeaks much lowder then all the reſt, or elſe except you ſingle out ſome one from the reſt, and go cloſe to him to confer with him of purpoſe. Our Intellect and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are like the lakes of water in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon roades, where the frequent paſſage of Horſes doth ſo muddy it, that you can ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it, eſpecially that is neer the bottom;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57538:94"/>
when in pure untroubled waters you may ſee a ſmall thing. In ſuch a confuſion and tumult as is uſually in mens ſouls, for a poor weak Chriſtian to ſeek for the diſcovery of his ſincerity, is according to the proverb, to ſeek for a needle in a bottle of hay. 5. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this, the corrupt heart of man, is ſo exceeding backward to the work of ſelf-examination, and the uſe of other means by which the ſoul ſhould be familiarly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it ſelf, that in a caſe of ſuch difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it will hardly ever overcome them, if it were a thing that might be done. In the beſt, a great deal of reſolvedneſs, diligence and unwearied conſtancy in ſearching into the ſtate of the ſoul, is neceſſary to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a ſetled Aſſurance and Peace: How much more in them that have ſo ſmall and almoſt undiſcernable a meaſure of Grace to diſcover. 6. Yet further, The Conceptions, Apprehenſions, and conſequently the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible motions of the Will, and eſpecially the Paſſions, are all naturally exceeding mutable: And while the mobile, agile ſpirits are any way the Inſtruments, it will be ſo: eſpecially where the Impreſſion which is made in the underſtanding is ſo ſmall and weak. Natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mans minde and will is exceeding mutable, turned into an hundred ſhapes in a few daies, according as objects are preſented to us, and

the temperature of the body diſpoſeth, helps or hinders the minde. Let us hear one man reaſon the Caſe; and we think he makes all as clear as the Light: Let us hear another ſolve all his Arguments, and diſpute for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and then we ſee that our Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were abuſed. Let us hear him Reply and confute all again, and confirm his Cauſe, and then we think him in the right again. Nothing more changeable then the concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings and minde of man, till he be throughly Reſolved and Habituated. Now in this Caſe, how ſhall thoſe that have but little Grace be able to diſcern it? It will not keep the minde from fluctuating. If they ſeem Reſolved for obedience to Chriſt to day, to morrow they are ſo ſhaken by ſome enticing object, and force of the ſame temptation, that their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution is undiſcernable; nay actually they prefer ſin at that time before obedience: It is impoſſible then but the ſoul ſhould ſtagger and be at a loſs; for it will judge of it ſelf as it findes it ſelf: and it cannot diſcern the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Prevalency of Chriſts Intereſt when they feel the Actual Prevalency of the fleſhes Intereſt. For the Act is the only diſcoverer of the Habit: And if <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf ſhould then have fallen to the examination of his heart, Whether he Preferred Chriſt before his Life, at the ſame time when he was deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57538:95"/>
and forſwearing Chriſt to ſave his Life, do you think he could have diſcerned it? and yet even then Chriſts Intereſt was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt in him Habitually. If <hi>David</hi> ſhould have gone to ſearch, whether he preferred obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God before his fleſhly pleaſure, when he was committing Adultery; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his credit, when he was plotting the death of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> what diſcovery do you think he would have made? 7. Add to all theſe, that as theſe ſeverall diſtempers, were they but in the ſame meaſure in a weak Chriſtian as they are in the beſt or in moſt, would yet make the ſmalleſt meaſure of Grace undiſcernable (if we might ſuppoſe the ſmalleſt Grace to be conſiſtent with ſuch a frame;) ſo it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that whoever he be that hath the leaſt meaſure of Grace to diſcover in himſelf, he hath proportionably the leaſt meaſure of abilities and helps to diſcover it, and the greateſt meaſure of all the forementioned hinderances: He that hath but a very little Repentance, Faith, Love and Obedience (ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,) when he goeth to finde it out, he hath in the ſame meaſure, a Darker Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to diſcern it, then others have; and a greater ſtrangeneſs and diſacquaintance with himſelf; and more deceitfulneſs in his heart; and a greater confuſion and hurlyburly in his thoughts and Affections, and all more
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57538:96"/>
out of order and to ſeek: Alſo he hath a greater backwardneſs to the work of ſelf-examination, and can hardly get his heart to it, and more hardly, to do it throughly and ſearch to the quick, and moſt hardly to hold on againſt all withdrawing temptations, till he have made a clearer diſcovery: And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his ſoul is more mutable then ſtronger Chriſtians are, and therefore when croſs Actings are ſo frequent, he cannot diſcern the ſmalleſt prevailing Habit. If (when you are weighing Gold) the ſcales be turned but with one grain, every little jogge, or winde, or unſteadfaſt holding will actually lift up the heavier end, and its preponderation is with great wavering and mobility. 8. Yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Conſider, thoſe that have leaſt Grace have moſt ſin, habitual and actual; and they are ſo frequent in tranſgreſſing, that their failings are ſtill in their eye: and thereby the prevalency of Chriſts intereſt is made more doubtfull and obſcure: For when he asketh his own conſcience, <hi>Do I will or love moſt the world and my fleſhly delights, or Chriſt and his wayes?</hi> preſently conſcience remembreth him, at ſuch a time, and ſuch a time thou didſt chooſe thy fleſhly pleaſures, profits or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and refuſe obedience: and it is ſo oft, and ſo foully, that the ſoul is utterly at a loſs, and cannot diſcern the Habitual prevalent bent
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57538:96"/>
and Reſolution of the Will. 9. Beſides, Conſcience is a Judge in mans ſoul, and will be Accuſing and condemning men ſo far as they are guilty: now they that make work for the moſt frequent and terrible Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Conſcience that will ſtand with true Grace, are unlikely to have Aſſurance. For Aſſurance quiets the ſoul and eaſeth it; and a galled Conſcience works the contrary way. They that keep open the wound, and daily fret off the skin more, and are ſtill gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the galled part, are unlikely to have Aſſurance. 10. Again, Theſe weakeſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians being leaſt in Duty and moſt in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (of any in whom ſin reigneth not) they are conſequently moſt in provoking and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpleaſing God. And they that do ſo, ſhall finde that God will ſhew them his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and will diſpleaſe them again. They muſt not look to enjoy Aſſurance, or ſee the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed face of God, till they are more carefull to pleaſe him, and are more ſparing and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in offending him. As Gods univerſal Juſtice in Governing the world, will make as great a difference between the ſincerely O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient and Diſobedient, as there is between Heaven and Hell; ſo God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

between his dreadfull frowns, and his joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reviving ſmiles; or between his ſmarting Rod, or his encouraging Rewards. 11. If God ſhould give Aſſurance and Peace to the ſinning and leaſt obedient believers, he ſhould not fit his providential diſpoſals to their good. It is not that which their ſtate requires, nor would it tend to their Cure any more then a healing Plaiſter to a ſore that is rotten in the bottom, or a Cordial to the removall of a cacochymy, or the purging out of corrupt redundant humours. They are ſo inclined to the Lethargy of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, that they have need of continual pinching, ſtriking or loud calling-on, to keep them waking: (ſtill remember, that by this weak Chriſtian, I mean not every doubting diſtreſſed ſoul, that is weak in their own apprehenſion, and little in their own eyes, and poor in ſpirit: but I mean thoſe that have the leaſt meaſure of ſincere Love to Chriſt, and deſire after him, and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of conſcience, and care to pleaſe God, and the greateſt meaſure of ſecurity, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, pride, fleſh-pleaſing, and boldneſs in ſinning, which is conſiſtent with ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the faith.)

Or juſt ſo far a man may go in neglecting duty to God and man, and in cheriſhing his fleſh, hiding his ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet be a true Believer and be ſaved. This would 1. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden men in ſinning, and make them think, I may yet venture, for I ſtand on ſafe ground: 2. And it would hinder Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: Indeed it would be the way to rob God of his honour; and multiply provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations againſt him, and keep his children in diſobedience, and hinder their growth in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and cauſe a deformity in Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and a ſhame to his Religion and ſacred name. As for thoſe that ſay, <hi>Aſſurance ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver encourageth men in ſin, but tends to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it.</hi> I anſwer, It is true of Gods Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſeaſonably given to thoſe that are
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57538:98"/>
fit for it, and uſed by them accordingly: But if God ſhould have told all the world, juſt how far they may ſin, and yet be certain of ſalvation, this would have bred Aſſurance in thoſe that were unfit for it, and it would have been but the putting of new wine into old crackt bottles, or a new piece into an old garment, that would break them, or make worſe the rent. I muſt therefore free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tell theſe objectors (I am ſorry that ſo many of my old acquaintance now harp ſo much on this Antinomian ſtring) that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or error hath ſo blinded them, that they have forgotten, or know not 1. What an imperfect piece the beſt is in this life, much more the worſt true Chriſtian. 2. Nor what a ſubtil Devil we have to tempt us. 3. Nor what an active thing corruption is, and what advantage it will take on unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Aſſurance. 4. Nor what the nature of Grace and Sanctification is; and how much of it lies in a godly jealouſie of our ſelves and apprehenſion of our danger, and that <hi>the fear of God is the beginning of wiſedom,</hi> See <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1. Nay 5. They have forgotten what a man is, and how inſeparable from his nature is the Principle of ſelf-preſervation, and how neceſſary the apprehenſion of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and the fear of evil to himſelf, is to the avoiding of that evil, and ſo to his preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57538:98"/>
8. Yea if they knew but what a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth or a family is, they would know that fear of evil, and deſire of ſelf-preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the very motive to Aſſociations, and the groundwork of all Laws and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a great part of the life of all Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>And thus I have fully proved to you, <hi>That the ſmalleſt meaſure of Grace, cannot help men to Aſſurance, in Gods ordinary way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Perhaps you will ſay, What comfort is there in this to a poor weak Chriſtian? This is rather the way to put him quite out of heart and hope. I anſwer. No ſuch matter: I ſhall ſhew you the uſes of this obſervation in the following Directions. In the mean time I will ſay but this, <hi>The expectations of unſeaſonable Aſſurance and out of Gods way, is a very great cauſe of keeping many in languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſtreſs, and of cauſing others to turn Antinomians, and ſnatch at comforts, which God never gave them, and to feign and frame an Aſſurance of their own making, or build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the deluſions of the great Deceiver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming himſelf into an Angel of Light.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p n="13">13. <hi>From the laſt mentioned Obſervation, there is one plain Conſectary ariſing, which I think you may do well to note by the way,</hi> viz. <hi>That</hi> According to Gods ordinary way of giving Grace, it cannot be expected that Chriſtians ſhould be able to know the very time of their firſt receiving or acting true ſaving Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or juſt when they were Pardoned, Juſtified, Adopted and put into a ſtate of Salvation.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis muſt needs be undeniable, if you grant the former Point, <hi>That the leaſt meaſure of Grace, yieldeth not Aſſurance of its ſincerity</hi> (which is proved:) and withall if you grant this plain truth, <hi>That it is Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way, to give a ſmall meaſure of Grace at the firſt.</hi> This I prove thus: 1. Chriſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth Gods Kingdom of Grace to a grain of muſtard ſeed, which is at firſt the leaſt of all ſeeds, but after cometh to a tree: And to a little leaven, which leaveneth the whole lump. I will not deny but this may be applied
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57538:99"/>
to the viſible progreſs of the Goſpel and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the Church: but it is plainly appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able alſo to the Kingdom of Chriſt within us. 2. The Scripture oft calleth ſuch young be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners, Babes, Children, Novices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. We are all commanded ſtill <hi>to grow in Grace</hi>; which implieth that we have our ſmalleſt meaſure at the firſt. 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. ſheweth, that ſtrength of Grace ſhould be according to time and means. 5. Common experience is an invincible argument for this. Men are at a diſtance from Chriſt when he firſt calleth them to come to him: and many ſteps they have <hi>Toward</hi> him before they reach <hi>To</hi> him. We are firſt ſo far enlightned as to ſee our ſin and miſery, and the meaning and truth of the Goſpel, and ſo rowſed out of our ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and made to look about us, and ſee that we have ſouls to ſave or loſe, and that it is no jeſting matter to be a Chriſtian: and ſo we come to underſtand the tenour of the Covenant, and Chriſts termes of ſaving men: But alas how long is it uſually after this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we come ſincerely to yield to his termes, and take him as he is offered, and Renounce the World, Fleſh and the Devil, and Give up our ſelves to him in a faithfull Covenant! We are long deliberating before we can get our backward hearts to Reſolve. How then ſhould a man know juſt when he was paſt
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57538:100"/>
the higheſt ſtep of common or preparative Grace, and arived at the firſt ſtep of ſpecial Grace?</p>
               <p>Yet mark, that I here ſpeak only of Gods ordinary way of giving Grace: For I doubt not but in ſome God may give a higher De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Grace at the firſt day of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, then ſome others do attain in many years. And thoſe may know the time of their true Converſion, both becauſe the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect was ſo diſcernable, and becauſe the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denneſs makes the change more ſenſible and obſervable.</p>
               <p>But this is not the ordinary courſe. Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily Convictions lye long on the ſoul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come to a true Converſion. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is wounded, and ſmarting long, and long grudging againſt our ſinfull and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent courſes, and telling us of the Neceſſity of Chriſt and a holy life, before we ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obey Conſcience, and give up our ſelves to Chriſt. We ſeldom yield to the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction or perſwaſion. The Fleſh hath uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally too long time given it to plead its own Cauſe; and to ſay to the Soul, <hi>Wilt thou forſake all thy pleaſure and merry company and courſes? Wilt thou beggar thy ſelf? or make thy ſelf a ſcorn and mocking ſtock to the world? Art thou ever able to hold out in ſo ſtrict a courſe? and to be undone? and to forſake all
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57538:100"/>
and lay down thy life for Chriſt? Is it not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter venture thy ſelf in the ſame way as thou haſt gone in, as well as others do, and as ſo many of thy forefathers have done before thee?</hi> Under ſuch ſinfull Deliberations as theſe we uſually continue long before we fully Reſolve: And many demurres and delayes we make before we conclude to take Chriſt on the terms that he is offered to us. Now I make no doubt but moſt or many Chriſtians can remember how and when God ſtirred their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and wakened them from their ſecurity, and made them look about them, and rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them out of their natural Lethargy: Some can tell what Sermon firſt did it: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers can remember by what degrees and ſteps God was doing it long: The ordinary way appointed by God for the doing of it firſt, is the inſtruction of Parents: And (as I have fullier manifeſted in my Book of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Baptiſm</hi>) if Parents would do their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they would find, that <hi>The Word</hi> publikely preached was not appointed to be the firſt ordinary means of Converſion and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; but commonly, Grace would be received in childhood: I ſpeak not of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal Relative Grace, conſiſting in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Original ſin; nor yet any infuſion of Habits before they have the uſe of reaſon (becauſe I ſuppoſe it is hid from us, what
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57538:101"/>
God doth in that.) But I ſpeak of actual Converſion: and I prove that this ſhould be the firſt ordinary way and time of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to the children of true Chriſtians, becauſe it is the firſt means that God hath appointed to be uſed with them. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.6, 7, 8. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.4. Parents are commanded to teach their children the Law of God, urgent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, at home and as they walk abroad, lying down and riſing up; and to bring them up in the admonition and nurture of the Lord: and to train up a child in the way he ſhould go, and then when they are old they will not depart from it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.6. And children are commanded to <hi>Remember their Creator in the dayes of their youth,</hi> Eccleſ. 12.1. And if this be Gods firſt great means, then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he will ordinarily bleſs his own means here, as well as in the Preaching of the Word.</p>
               <p>From all this I would have you learn this leſſon: That <hi>you ought not to trouble your ſelf with fears and doubts leſt you are not truly Regenerate, becauſe you know not the Sermon or the very time and manner of your Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but finde that you have grace, and then, though you know not juſt the time or manner of your receiving of it, yet you may nevertheleſs be Aſſured of Salvation by it.</hi> Search there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what you are, and how your will is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57538:101"/>
and reſolved, and how your Life is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, rather then to know how you became ſuch. I know the workings of the Spirit on the ſoul may be diſcerned, becauſe they ſtir up diſcernable Actings in our own ſpirits. The ſouls Convictions, Conſideration, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions and Affections are no inſenſible things: But yet the work of Grace uſually begins in common Grace, and ſo proceeds by degrees till it come to ſpecial ſaving Grace, even as the work of nature doth, firſt producing the matter and then introducing the form; firſt producing the <hi>embryo,</hi> before it introduce a Rational ſoul. And as no child knows the time or manner of his own For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, Vivification or Reception of that ſoul, ſo I think, few true Believers can ſay, Juſt ſuch a day, or at ſuch a Sermon I became a true Juſtified, ſanctified man. That was the hour of your true Converſion and Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>When you firſt preferred God and Chriſt and Grace before all things in this world, and deliberately and ſeriouſly Reſolved to take Chriſt for your Saviour and Governour, and give up your ſelf to him to be ſaved, taught and governed, and to obey him faithfully to the death againſt all Temptations, whatſoever you ſhould loſe or ſuffer by it.</hi> Now I would but ask thoſe very Chriſtians that think they do know the very Sermon that converted them, Did that
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57538:102"/>
Sermon bring you to this Reſolution? Or was it not only ſome troubling, rowſing preparation hereto? I think ſome deſperate ſickneſs or the like Affliction is a very uſual means to bring Reſolutions to be downright and fixed, with many ſouls that long delayed and fluctuated in unreſolvedneſs, and lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der meer uneffectual Convictions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But this runs on your own grounds, that ſaving Grace and common Grace do differ but in degrees.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I think moſt will confeſs that as to the Acts of Grace, and that is it that we are now enquiring after; and that is all the means that we have of diſcerning the Habits: Yet remember that I ſtill tell you, That <hi>there is a ſpecifical Moral difference, though groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded but in a gradual Natural difference.</hi> Yea and that one grain of the Spirits working, which turns the Will in a prevalent meaſure for Chriſt, (together with the illumination neceſſary thereto) deſerves all thoſe elogies and high titles that are given it in the Word; ſo great a change doth it make in the ſoul! Well may it be called, <hi>The New Creature: Born of the Spirit: The Workmanſhip of God: The new Life:</hi> yea <hi>The Image of God,</hi> and <hi>The Divine Nature</hi> (if that Text be not meant of the Divine Nature in Chriſt which we are Relatively made partakers of in our
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57538:102"/>
Union with him.) When you are weighing things in the balance, you may add grain after grain, and it makes no turning or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all, till you come to the very laſt grain, and then ſuddenly that end which was downward is turned upward. When you ſtand at a loſs between two highwayes, not knowing which way to go, as long as you are deliberate, you ſtand ſtill: All the Reaſons that come into your minde, do not ſtir you: But the laſt Reaſon which Reſolves you, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth you in motion. So is it in the change of a ſinners heart and life: He is not changed (but preparing towards it) while he is but Deliberating, Whether he ſhould chooſe Chriſt or the world? But the laſt Reaſon that comes in and Determineth his Will to Chriſt, and makes him reſolve and enter a firm Covenant with Chriſt, and ſay, <hi>I will have Chriſt for Better or Worſe,</hi> this maketh the greateſt change that ever is made by any work in this world. For how can there be greater then the turning of a ſoul from the creature to the Creator? ſo diſtant are the Terms of this change. After this one Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing act Chriſt hath that Heart, and the main bent and endeavours of the life, which the world had before. The man hath a new End, a new Rule and Guide, and a new Maſter. Before the Fleſh and the Devil were his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57538:103"/>
and now Chriſt is his Maſter. So that you muſt not think ſo meanly of the Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Determining, Reſolving act of Grace, becauſe it lieth but in a gradual difference naturally from common Grace, If a Prince ſhould offer a condemned beggar to marry her, and pardon her, and make her his Queen; Her Deliberation may be the way to her Conſent, and one Reaſon after another may bring her near to conſenting. But it is that which turns her Will to Conſent, Reſolve, Covenant and Deliver her ſelf to him, which makes the great change in her ſtate. Yet all the foregoing Work of common Grace hath a hand in the change, though only the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reſolution do effect it: It is the reſt with this that doth it: As when the laſt grain turns the ſcales, the former do concurre.

                  <p n="14">14. <hi>Yet further I would have you to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand this: That</hi> As the leaſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Saving Grace is ordinarily undiſcernable from the greateſt meaſure of common Grace, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the greatneſs of the change that it makes) ſo a meaſure ſomewhat greater is ſo hardly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable, that it ſeldom brings Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: And therefore it is only the ſtronger Chriſtians that attain Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ordinarily; even thoſe, who have a great degree of Faith and Love, and keep them much in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and are very watchfull and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in Obedience: And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (moſt Chriſtians being of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker ſort) it is but few that do attain to Aſſurance of their Juſtification and Salvation.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HEre are two or three points which I would have you diſtinctly to obſerve, though I lay them all together for brevity.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57538:104"/>
1. That it is only a greater meaſure of Grace that will ordinarily afford Aſſurance. 2. That therefore it is only the ſtronger and holier and more obedient ſort of Chriſtians that uſually reach to a Certainty of Salvation. 3. That few Chriſtians do reach to a ſtrong or high degree of Grace. 4. And therefore it is but few Chriſtians that reach to Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p>For the two firſt of theſe it will evidently appear that they are true, by reviewing the Reaſons which I gave of the laſt point ſave one. He that will attain to a Certainty of Salvation, muſt 1. Have a large meaſure of Grace to be diſcerned. 2. He muſt have that Grace much in Action, and lively Action: For it is not meer Habits that are diſcerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. 3. He muſt have a clear underſtanding to be acquainted with the Nature of Spiritual things: To know what is a ſound evidence, and how to follow the ſearch, and how to repell particular Temptations. 4. He muſt have a good acquaintance and familiarity with his own heart: and to that end muſt be much at home, and be uſed ſometime to a diligent obſervation of his heart and waies. 5. He muſt be in a good meaſure acquainted with, and a Conquerour of contradicting Temptations. 6. He muſt have ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent cure of the deep Deceitfulneſs of the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:57538:104"/>
heart, and it muſt be brought to an open, plain, ingenuous frame, willing to know the worſt of it ſelf. 7. He muſt have ſome cure of that ordinary confuſion and tumultuous diſorder that is in the thoughts and affections of men: and get things into an order in his minde. 8. He muſt be a man of Diligence, Reſolution, and unwearied Patience, that will Reſolvedly ſet on the work of ſelf-exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and painfully watch in it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly follow it from time to time till he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Certainty. 9. He muſt be one that is very fearfull of ſinning, and carefull in cloſe obedient walking with God, and much in ſincere and ſpiritual duty, that he keep not conſcience ſtill in accuſing and condemning him, and God ſtill offended with him, and his wounds freſh bleeding, and his Soul ſtill ſmarting. 10. He muſt be a man of much fixedneſs and conſtancy of minde, and not of the ordinary mutability of mankinde; that ſo he may not by remitting his zeal and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, loſe the ſight of his evidences, nor by leaving open his ſoul to an alteration by every new intruding thought and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let go his Aſſurance as ſoon as he attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it. All theſe things in a good degree are Neceſſary to the attaining of Aſſurance of Salvation.</p>
               <p>And then do I need to ſay any more to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57538:105"/>
the Confirmation of the third Point, That few Chriſtians reach this meaſure of Grace? O that it were not as clear as the light, and as diſcernable as the earth under our feet, that moſt true Chriſtians are weaklings and of the lower forms in the School of Chriſt! Alas, how ignorant are moſt of the beſt? How little Love, or Faith, or Zeal, or heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-mindedneſs, or Delight in God, have they? How unacquainted with a frequent exerciſe of theſe Graces? How unacquainted with the way of ſelf-examination? and how back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to it? and how dull and careleſs in it? doing it by the halves, as <hi>Laban</hi> ſearched <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chels</hi> Tent? How eaſily put off with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe? How little acquainted with their own hearts? or with Satans temptations, and waies of deceiving? how much deceitfulneſs remaineth in their hearts? how confuſed are their mindes? and what diſtractions and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults are there in their thoughts? how bold are they in ſinning? and how little tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Conſcience, and care of obeying have they? how frequently do they wound Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, provoke God, and obſcure their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences? and how mutable are their Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions? and how ſoon do they loſe that Aſſurance which they once attain? and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every occaſion quite loſe the ſight of their evidences? yea and Remit their actual
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57538:105"/>
Reſolutions, and ſo loſe much of the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it ſelf? Is not this the common caſe of Godly people? O that we could truly deny it: Let their lives be witneſs, let their viſible neglects, worldlineſs, pride, impatien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of plain Reproof, remiſneſs of Zeal, dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and cuſtomarineſs in Duty, ſtrangeneſs to God, unwillingneſs to ſecret Prayer and Meditation, unacquaintedneſs with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits operations and joyes, their unpeace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs one with another, and their too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent blemiſhing the glory of their holy Profeſſion by the unevenneſs of their walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, let all theſe witneſs, whether the School of Chriſt have not moſt children in it: and how few of them ever go to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity</hi> of riper knowledge? and how few of thoſe are fit to begin here the works of their Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Office, which they muſt live in for ever? in the high and joyfull Praiſes of God and of the Lamb, who hath Redeemed them by his Blood, and made them Kings and Prieſts to God, that they may Reign with him for ever? I am content to ſtand to the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all humble ſelf-knowing Chriſtians, whether this be not true of moſt of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? and for thoſe that deny it, I will ſtand to the Judgement of their Godly neighbors, who perhaps know them better then they know themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:57538:106"/>And then this being all ſo, the fourth point is undeniable, That <hi>It is but very few Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that reach to Aſſurance of Salvation.</hi> If any think (as intemperate hot ſpirited men are like enough to charge me) that in all this I countenance the Popiſh doctrine of Doubting and Uncertainty, and contradict the common doctrine of the Reformed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines that Write againſt them; I anſwer, 1. I do contradict both the Papiſts that deny Aſſurance, and many forreign Writers who make it farre more Eaſie, Common, and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary then it is (much more both them and the Antinomiſts, who place Juſtifying faith in it.) But I ſtand in the midſt between both extreams; and I think I have the company of moſt Engliſh Divines. 2. I come not to be of this minde meerly by reading Books, but mainly, by reading my own heart, and conſulting my own experience, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of a very great number of Godly people of all ſorts, who have opened their hearts to me, for almoſt twenty years time. 3. I would intreat the gainſayers to ſtudy their own hearts better for ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time, and to be more in hearing the caſe and complaints of Godly people; and by that time they may happily come to be of my minde. 4. See whether all thoſe Divines that have been very practical, and ſucceſsfull
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57538:106"/>
in the work of God, and much acquainted with the way of the Recovery of loſt ſouls, be not all of the ſame Judgement as I in this point, (ſuch as <hi>T. Hooker, Jo. Rogers, Preſton, Sibs, Bolton, Dod, Culverwell,</hi> &amp;c.) And whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the confidenteſt men for the contrary be not thoſe that ſtudy Books more then hearts, and ſpend their daies in Diſputing, and not in winning ſouls to God from the world.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Let me add to what is ſaid, theſe two Proofs of this fourth Point here aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The conſtant experience of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of Believers, tels us, that Certainty of ſalvation is very rare. Even of thoſe that live comfortably and in peace of Conſcience, yet very few of them do attain to a Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For my part, it is known that God in undeſerved Mercy hath given me long the ſociety of a great number of Godly people, and great intereſt in them, and privacy with them, and opportunity to know their mindes, and this in many places (my ſtation by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence having been oft removed:) and I muſt needs profeſs, that of all theſe I have met with few, yea very few indeed, that if I ſeriouſly and privately asked them, <hi>Are you Certain that you are a true Believer, and ſo are Juſtified and ſhall be Saved,</hi> durſt ſay to me,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57538:107"/>
                  <hi>I am Certain of it.</hi> But ſome in great doubts and fears: moſt too ſecure and neglective of their ſtates, without Aſſurance, and ſome in ſo good hopes (to ſpeak in their own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage) as calmeth their ſpirits, that they can comfortably caſt themſelves on God in Chriſt. And thoſe few that have gone ſo far beyond all the reſt, as to ſay, <hi>They were Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of their ſincerity and ſalvation,</hi> were the Profeſſors whoſe ſtate I ſuſpected more then any of the reſt; as being the moſt proud, ſelf-conceited, cenſorious, paſſionate, unpeacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſort of Profeſſors: and ſome of them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſcandalouſly, and ſome fallen ſince to more ſcandalous waies then ever: And the moſt of their humble, godly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or neighbours ſuſpected them as well as I. Or elſe ſome very few of them that ſaid they were Certain, were honeſt godly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (moſt women) of ſmal Judgement and ſtrong Affections; who depended moſt on that which is commonly called <hi>The ſenſe or feeling of Gods Love</hi>; and were the loweſt at ſome times, as they were the higheſt at other times: and they that were one moneth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to be ſaved, perhaps the next moneth were almoſt ready to ſay, they ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be damned. So that taking out all theſe ſorts of perſons, the ſober, ſolid, judicious Believers, that could groundedly and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57538:107"/>
ſay, <hi>I am Certain that I ſhall be Saved,</hi> have been ſo few, that it is ſad to me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it. If any other mens experiences be contrary, I am glad of it; ſo be it they be Sober Judicious men able to gather experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; and ſo they live not among meer Antinomians, and take not the diſcovery of their meer opinion, for a diſcovery of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. For I have ſeen in divers profeſſors of my long acquaintance, the ſtrange power of Opinion and Phantaſie in this thing. I have known thoſe that have lived many years in doubting of their Salvation, and all that while walked uprightly; and in the late Warres, falling into the company of ſome Anabaptiſts, they were by them perſwaded that there was no right way to their comfort but by being Re-baptized, and aſſociating themſelves with the Re-baptized Church, and abſtaining from the hearing of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized Pariſh Prieſts (as they called them) No ſooner was this done, but all their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer doubtings and troubles were over, and they were as comfortable as any others (as themſelves affirmed) which no doubt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from, partly the ſtrength of Phantaſie conceiting it ſhould ſo be, and partly from the Novelty of their way which delighted them, and partly from the ſtrong<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Opinion they had that this was the way of Salvation,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57538:108"/>
and that the want of this did keep them in the dark ſo long, and partly from Satans po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, who troubleth people leaſt, when they are in a way that pleaſeth him: But when theſe people had lived a year or two in this comfortable condition, they fell at laſt into the ſociety of ſome Libertines or Familiſts, who believe that the Scriptures are all but a dream, fiction or Allegory: Theſe preſently perſwaded them, that they were fools to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard Baptiſm or ſuch Ordinances, and that they might come to hear again in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, ſeeing all things were lawfull, and there was no Heaven or Hell but within men, and therefore they ſhould look to their ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and credit in the world, and take their pleaſure. This leſſon was quickly learned, and then they cried down the Anabaptiſts, and confeſſed they were deluded, and ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grown looſe while they were Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, to mend the matter, they grew Epicures when they had been inſtructed by the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, and this was the end of their new got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten comfort. Others I have known that have wanted Aſſurance, and falling among the Antinomians, were told by them that they undid themſelves by looking after Signs and Marks of Grace, and ſo laying their comforts upon ſomething in themſelves: whereas they ſhould look only to Chriſt for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57538:108"/>
and not at any thing in themſelves at all: and for Aſſurance, it is only the Witneſs of the Spirit without any Marks, that muſt give it them; and to fetch Comfort from their own Graces and Obedience, was to make it themſelves in ſtead of Chriſt and the holy Ghoſt, and was a Legal way: No ſooner was this Doctrine received, but the Receivers had Comfort at will, and all was ſealed up to them preſently by the Witneſs of the Spirit in their own Conceits: Whence this came, judge you: I told you my judgement before. Sure I am that the ſudden looſeneſs of their lives, anſwering their ignorant, looſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſpel-like doctrine, did certifie me that the Spirit of Comfort was not their Comforter: For he is alſo a Spirit of Holineſs, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth men by the means of a holy Goſpel, which hath precepts and threatnings as well as Promiſes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as the experience of the ſtate of Believers aſſureth us that few of them at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to Certainty; ſo experience of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of their underſtandings ſhews us that few of them are immediatly capable of it. For how few Believers be there that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand well, what is a ſound evidence, and what not? Nay how many Learned men have taught them, That the leaſt unfeigned Deſire of Grace, is the Grace it ſelf (as ſome
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57538:109"/>
ſay) or at leaſt a certain evidence of it (as others ſay:) Whereas, alas, how many have unfeignedly deſired many Graces, and yet have Deſired the Glory and Profits of the world ſo much more, that they have miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and periſhed? How many have taught them that the leaſt unfeigned Love to God, or to the Brethren, is a certain Mark of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Grace? Whenas many a one hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly loved God and the Brethren, who yet have loved houſe, land, credit, pleaſure, and life ſo much more, that God hath been thruſt as it were into a corner, and hath had but the worlds leavings; and the poor Saints have had little compaſſion or relief from them, nor would be lookt on in times of danger and diſgrace. As <hi>Auſtin</hi> and the Schoolmen uſe to ſay, Wicked men do <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ti Deo &amp; frui creaturis, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe God and enjoy the creatures:</hi> Godly men do <hi>Frui Deo, &amp; uti creaturis, Enjoy God and uſe the creatures.</hi> The meaning is, Both Regenerate and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate have ſome Will or Love, both to God and to the Creature: But the wicked do Will or Love the Creature as their chief Good with their chiefeſt Love, and they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Love God as a Means to help them to the Creature, with a Love ſubordinate to their Love to the Creature: Whereas the Godly do Will or Love God as their chief Good,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57538:109"/>
with their chiefeſt Love or Complacency, and Love the Creature but as a Means to God, with an inferiour Love.</p>
               <p>If then the Nature of Sincerity be ſo little known, then Aſſurance of Sincerity cannot be very common. More might be ſaid to prove that Certainty of Salvation is not common among true Chriſtians; but that it is labour in vain, as to them, ſeeing experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and their own ready confeſſion doth witneſs it.</p>
               <p>Now what's the uſe that I would have you make of this? Why it is this: If Aſſurance of Sincerity and Juſtification (much more of Salvation) be ſo rare among true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, then you have no cauſe to think that the want of it proveth you to be no true Chriſtian. You ſee then that a man may be in a ſtate of Salvation without it; and that it is not Juſtifying Faith, as ſome have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, nor yet a neceſſary concomitant of that Faith. You ſee that you were miſtaken in thinking that you had not the Spirit of Adoption, becauſe you had no aſſuring wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs within you effectively teſtifying to you that you are the childe of God. All Gods children have the Spirit of Adoption: (For becauſe they are ſons, therefore hath God ſent the Spirit of his Son into their hearts, whereby they cry <hi>Abba Father,</hi> Gal. 4.6.)
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57538:110"/>
But all Gods children have not Aſſurance of their Adoption; therefore the Spirit of Adoption doth not alwaies aſſure thoſe of their Adoption in whom it abideth. It is alwaies a witneſs-bearer of their Adoption: But that is only objectively by his Graces and operations in them; as a Land-mark is a witneſs whoſe Land it is where it ſtandeth: or as your Sheep-mark witneſſeth which be your Sheep: or rather as a ſenſible Soul witneſſeth a living Creature, or a rational Soul witneſſeth that we are Men: But effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently it doth not alwaies witneſs: as a Land-mark or Sheep-mark is not alway diſcerned: and a bruit knows not it ſelf to be a bruit: and a man is not alwaies actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally knowing his own humanity, nor can know it at all in the Womb, in Infancy, in Diſtraction, in an Epilepſie, Apoplexie or the like diſeaſe which depriveth him of the uſe of reaſon. Beſides, it's no doubt, but the Apoſtle had ſome reſpect to the eminent gift of the Spirit, for Tongues, Prophecies, Miracles and the like which was proper to that age; though ſtill as including the Spirit of Holineſs.</p>
               <p>You ſee then that you need not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in diſquiet when you want Aſſurance: For elſe how diſquiet a life ſhould moſt Chriſtians live! I ſhall ſhew you more anon
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57538:110"/>
that all a mans comforts depend not ſo on his Aſſurance, but that he may live a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable life without it: Trouble of minde may be overcome; Conſcience may be quieted; True peace attained, yea a man may have that Joy in the holy Ghoſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Kingdom of God is ſaid to conſiſt, without Certainty of Salvation. (If there be any paſſage in my Book of <hi>Reſt,</hi> Part 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, in preſſing to get Aſſurance, which ſeem contrary to this, I deſire that they may be reduced to this ſenſe, and no otherwiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.) This ſhall be further opened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and other grounds of comfort manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, beſides Aſſurance.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p n="15">15. <hi>Yea this much more I would here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you of, That</hi> Very many even of the ſtronger, holier, watchfull, and obedient Chriſtians, are yet uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of their Salvation, even then when they are Certain of their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and Sanctification; and that becauſe they are uncertain of their perſeverance and overcoming: For a mans Certainty of his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be no ſtronger than is his Certainty of enduring to the end and overcoming.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THat you may not miſunderſtand me in this, obſerve 1. That I do not ſay Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance is a thing uncertain in it ſelf: 2. Nor that it is uncertain to all Chriſtians: 3. But that it is uncertain to many even ſtrong and ſelf-knowing Chriſtians. Divines uſe to diſtinguiſh of the Certainty of the Object, and of the Subject: and the former is either of the Object of Gods Knowledge,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57538:111"/>
or of mans. I doubt not but God knows Certainly who ſhall be ſaved, which with his Decree doth cauſe that which we call Certainty of the Object, as to mans under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: But men themſelves do not alwaies know it.</p>
               <p>If a man have the fulleſt Certainty in the world that he is Gods child, yet if he be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain whether he ſhall ſo continue to the end, it is impoſſible that he ſhould have a Certainty of his Salvation. For it's he only that endureth to the end that ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Now that many eminent Chriſtians of great knowledge and much zeal and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence are uncertain of their Perſeverance, is proved by two Infallible Arguments. 1. By experience: If any ſhould be ſo cenſorious as to think that none of all thoſe Nations and Churches abroad that deny the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Certain Perſeverance of all Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, have any ſtrong Chriſtians among them, yet we have had the knowledge of ſuch at home. 2. Beſides the Difficulty of the Subject is a clear Argument that a ſtrong Chriſtian may be uncertain of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God hath made all thoſe points plain in Scripture, which muſt be Believed as of Neceſſity to Salvation: But the Certainty of all Believers Perſeverance, is not a Point
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57538:112"/>
of flat Neceſſity to Salvation to be Believed. Otherwiſe it would be a hard matter to prove that any conſiderable number were ever ſaved, till of late; or are yet ſaved, but in a very few Countries. It is a Point that the Churches never did put into their Creed; where they ſummed up thoſe Points that they held neceſſary to Salvation. There are a great number of Texts of Scripture which ſeeming to intimate the contrary, do make the Point of great Difficulty to many of the wiſeſt. And thoſe Texts that are for it, are not ſo expreſs as fully to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them. Beſides that the examples of theſe ten years laſt paſt have done more to ſtagger many ſober wiſe Chriſtians in this Point, then all the Arguments that ever were uſed by Papiſts, Arminians or any other: To ſee what kinde of men in ſome places have fallen, and how far; as I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing further to mention.</p>
               <p>If you ask me, what I think of this my ſelf, and conſequently what Aſſurance I have of my own Salvation; I will freely tell you, both how far I am arrived in Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of Sincerity of Grace and Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and how farre in the matter of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance and ſo of Salvation. I lay ſeven years under great Doubtings of the truth of my Sanctification; eſpecially for want
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57538:112"/>
of thoſe Lively, Affectionate, Heart-melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effects which I deſired to have found; and for want of Deeper apprehenſions of God, Chriſt, Glory, Sin, Miſery, Mercy, Duty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which made me ſtill fear that all I had was but the meer effects of Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Reading and Speculative Knowledge; and ſo that I had only a Notional Religion, that touched my Phantaſie and ſwom in my Brain, but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> workt not throughly on my Heart; for want of more Deep and Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Believing of thoſe holy Truths which ſhould be operative. Yet all this while, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities of Grace, affording me that which we commonly call <hi>Hope,</hi> did bear me up. Now through the great unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Mercy of my God, I have attained to ſo ſtrong a Probability of my Sincerity and Sanctification, as in a large ſenſe may be called Aſſurance or Certainty, but not in the ſtricteſt ſenſe: much leſs is it a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Aſſurance: I have ſo ſtrong a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of the truth of my Faith, and ſo of the pardon of my ſinnes, as overcometh moſt doubtings and trouble of minde, and keepeth me in quietneſs and peace of minde, and ſome Joy in the holy Ghoſt, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull thoughts of my everlaſting Reſt; and gives me a Confidence in God, and Acceſs with boldneſs to the Throne of his
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57538:113"/>
Grace. But yet I finde that carnal ſecurity hath a great hand in the alaying of my troubles, though not in the raiſing of my Joyes: (And it is no unuſual thing for a good Cauſe and a bad Faith, Aſſurance and Carnal ſecurity to joyn together in one effect; even in expelling trouble from the heart.) Yet dare I ſcarce ſay (in the uſual ſenſe of the word,) that <hi>I am certain of my Sincerity and ſo of my Juſtification:</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when Temptations have prevailed, and the ſtrength of the fleſhes intereſt, and the weakneſs of Chriſts intereſt in my Eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Will and Affections, have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more then ordinary: And when I have thought how much ſtronger Trials I may yet be put to, which others daily undergo: eſpecially the Temptations of Proſperity do oftner make me fear, then thoſe of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and adverſity. I am ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, leſt it be but the weakneſs of my Body, and the diſtance of Objects, and ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Temptations, that makes them no more prevailing with me: And that if I had as ſtrong a body as others, and were in that Dignity, Wealth and Abundance of all things, as ſome are; whether Honors, Car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57538:113"/>
that made as great a ſhew of Holineſs. Yet do not theſe doubts much affright or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet me, becauſe I finde God at preſent poſſeſſing me with thoſe Reſolutions to caſt away all for Chriſt, which, I doubt not, are the work of his own Grace, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have experience of abundance of preventing and ſuſtaining Grace; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I finde at the preſent that God ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth me to account all things loſs and droſs and dung for him, and eaſily without much reluctancy to empty my purſe for him and his poor, and to lay out my time and ſtrength for him and his Church, and with ſome good ſucceſs to reſiſt Temptations; and that I have no Deſire, (in any activity or prevalency) to be any higher in the world then I am, but think God hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen out for me the beſt condition and ſtation that I could have deſired in all the world. And then for Perſeverance and Salvation, this is my Caſe: It is my ſtrong opinion that no man who hath attained to a Rooted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Faith, and ſo is throughly ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, doth ever totally and finally fall away: which Chriſt ſeemeth to intimate in ſaying that the Cauſe why men fall away in Tribulation and Perſecution, is becauſe the ſeed had not deep Rooting, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. And I am yet more confident that none of the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57538:114"/>
Elect ſhall ever fall away; and perſwaded, that all the Rooted, through-Chriſtians, are Elect. But yet I dare not ſay, that <hi>I am Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of this,</hi> that all are elect to ſalvation, and ſhall never fall away totally and finally, who ſincerely Believe and are Juſtified. It is my opinion, but I dare not put it into my Creed among either the Points of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Neceſſity, or undoubted Verity. I know how many Texts of Scripture ſeem to ſpeak otherwiſe: and I know how gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the Primitive Fathers thought other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if a man can know their mindes by their Writings: I know that <hi>Auſtin</hi> himſelf, the Mall of the Pelagians, ſeems to be either unreſolv'd, or more againſt this Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance then for it. I know how many Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Godly men do differ from me, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Certainty of Perſeverance: I know how ſad and ſhaking examples this age hath afforded: And therefore I am not Certain, properly, ſtrictly Certain, of my Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and ſo not fully, ſtrictly Certain of my Salvation: Nor ſo near to a Certainty of my Salvation, as I am to a Certainty of my Faith, Juſtification, Adoption and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification. Yet am I ſo ſtrongly confident of it, (that I ſhall hold out, and be ſaved) that it doth not only calm and quiet my minde, and overcome my troubles and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:57538:114"/>
fears, but alſo enable me to Rejoyce in Hope of the Glory to come, and to Deſire Chriſts coming to Judgement, and to think of Death with much more contentedneſs and ſubmiſſion then elſe I ſhould do: For as I am much perſwaded that the Rooted in Grace do never fall quite away, ſo if I were ſure that they did, yet I know ſo much of the Graciouſneſs of Gods Nature, and his Covenant, that he will not forſake any that do not wilfully forſake him; and I have ſo full a Reſolution to cleave to him wrought in me by his Spirit, and ſuch experience of tender Love, and his preſerving me in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, that I have a ſtrong confidence that he will never permit me to fall from him. Yet do I ſee a Neceſſity of daily praying to him <hi>Not to Lead me into Temptation, but to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me from the evil</hi>; and to live in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual watchfulneſs, expecting daily Aſſaults, and renewing daily my Repentance and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions.</p>
               <p>Thus have I, as truly as I am now able, opened my very heart and ſtate to you, as before the Searcher of my heart: which I have done for three Reaſons. 1. That my Judgement may be truly known in the Point of Perſeverance. 2. Becauſe I finde the communicating of Experiences of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hearts and ſtates is of great uſe to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:57538:115"/>
3. Becauſe I finde that many God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people, by divers paſſages in my Book of <hi>Reſt,</hi> about Living in <hi>Heavenly Delights,</hi> do think that I have attained a greater Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty then I have: and that themſelves are unhappy and muſt live uncomfortably till they can attain to that which they think I have done. As for thoſe that think, and will be ready to ſay, that I am warping to Arminian or Popiſh Doubting; I regard not their words or cenſures: I am none of thoſe that dare in the hearing of God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that I have the Certainty which I have not, meerly to avoid the ſuſpition of erring. Nor dare I by hot Diſputes maintain that which the conſtant Experience of my ſelf and the beſt and moſt of my acquaintance doth contradict: and believe my Authors before my own heart, and the undoubted teſtimony of Chriſtians concerning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Yet remember that I do not deny but many others may have both more Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their own Sincerity, and more clear underſtanding of the Doctrine of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance then I have; which may give them a Certainty that no true Believer ſhall quite fall away. I dare not think that others have not a higher degree of Light and Certainty then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But I think by this time I have perſwaded

you that a proper Certainty of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not ſo common a thing as ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſal Doctors, or ſome ſelf-conceited Proſeſſors do take it to be. And therefore that you muſt not lay all your comfort on your Aſſurance of Salvation. As for them who are moſt highly confident both of the doctrine of the Certain Perſeverance of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Believer, meerly upon tradition, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, becauſe they have been alway taught ſo, or elſe upon weak grounds which will not bear them out in their confidence; and are as confident of their own Salvation on as ſlender grounds, having never well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Nature of ſaving Grace, Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Examination nor Aſſurance; nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Cauſes of doubting which might elſe have ſhaked them; I will not call their greateſt Confidence, by the name of Aſſurance or Certainty of Salvation, though it be accompanied with never ſo great boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or pretenſes or expreſſions of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Joyes. And for your ſelf I adviſe you, firſt uſe thoſe comforts which thoſe may have who come ſhort of Aſſurance.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p n="16">16. <hi>The next thing which I would have you learn is this, That</hi> There are ſeveral grounds of the great Probability of our Salvation, beſides the general grounds mentioned in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and by the Knowledge of theſe, without any further Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, a Chriſtian may live in much Peace and Comfort, and in Delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, Deſirous thoughts of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to come: And therefore the next work which you have to do, is to diſcover thoſe probabilites of your Sincerity and your Salvation, and then to receive the Peace and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort which they may afford you, before you can expect Aſſurance it
ſelf.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Shall here open to you the ſeveral parts of this Propoſition and Direction di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly. 1. I told you in the beginning of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57538:116"/>
the four grounds of Probability which all may have in general, from 1. The Nature of God, 2. And of the Mediatour; and his Office. 3. And the <hi>univerſal</hi> ſufficiency of Chriſts ſatisfaction. 4. And the general te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Promiſe and offer of Pardon and Salvation. Now I adde; that beſides all theſe, there are many grounds of ſtrong Probability which you may have of your own Sincerity, and ſo of your particular Intereſt in Chriſt and Salvation, when you cannot reach to a Certainty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some kinde of Probability you may gather by comparing your ſelf with others. Though this way be but deluſory to unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men, whoſe confidence is plainly contradicted by the Scriptures, yet may it be lawfull and uſefull to an humble ſoul that is willing to obey and wait on God: I mean, to conſider, that if ſuch as you ſhould periſh, how few people would God have in the world? Conſider firſt in how narrow a compaſs the Church was confined before Chriſts coming in the fleſh? and how carnal and corrupt even that viſible Church then was? and even at this day, the moſt Learned do compute, that if you divide the world into thirty parts, nineteen of them are Heatheniſh Idolaters, ſix of them are Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57538:117"/>
them are Chriſtians. And of theſe five that are Chriſtians, how great a part are of the Aethiopian, Greek and Popiſh Churches? ſo ignorant, rude and ſuperſtitious and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, that ſalvation cannot be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be near ſo eaſie or ordinary with them as with us: and of the Reformed Churches, commonly called Proteſtants, how ſmall is the number? And even among theſe, What a number are groſſely igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and prophane? and of thoſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs more knowledge and zeal, how many are groſſely Erroneous, Schiſmatical and Scandalous. How exceeding ſmal a number is left then that are ſuch as you? I know this is no aſſuring Argument: but I know withall that Chriſt died not in vain; but he will ſee the fruit of his ſufferings to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of his ſoul: and the God of Mercy, who is a Lover of mankinde, will have a multitude innumerable of his ſaved ones in the earth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But your ſtrongeſt Probabilities are from the Conſideration of the Work of God upon your Soul, and the preſent frame and inclination of your Soul to God. You may know that you have workings above nature in you; and that they have been kept alive and carried on theſe many years againſt all oppoſition of the fleſh and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57538:117"/>
the world: It hath not been a meer flaſh of conviction which hath been extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſenſuality, and left you in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſecurity and prophanneſs as others are. You dare not give up your Hopes of Heaven for all the world: You would not part with Chriſt, and ſay, Let him go, for all the pleaſures of ſin, or treaſures of the earth: If you had (as you have) an offer of God, Chriſt, Grace and Glory on one ſide, and worldly proſperity in ſin on the other ſide, you would chooſe God, and let go the other. You dare not, you would not give over Praying, Hearing, Reading, and Chriſtian company, and give up your ſelf to worldly, fleſhly pleaſures; yet you are not Aſſured of ſalvation, becauſe you finde not that Delight and Life in Duty, and that Witneſs of the Spirit, and that communion with God, nor that tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, as you deſire. It is well that you deſire them: But though you be not Certain of Salvation, do not you ſee a great likelihood, a Probability in all this? Is not your heart raiſed to a Hope that yet God is mercifull to you, and means you good? Doubtleſs this you might eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing that I am to ſhew you is, that there may much ſpiritual Comfort
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57538:118"/>
and Peace of Conſcience be enjoyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Certainty of Salvation, given upon theſe forementioned Probabilities. Which I prove thus, 1. No doubt but <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency had Peace of Conſcience, and Comfort and Communion with God, and yet he had no Aſſurance of Salvation; I mean, either of continuing in Paradiſe, or being tranſlated to Glory. For if he had, either he was ſure to perſevere in Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and ſo to be glorified. (But that was not true) or elſe he muſt foreknow both that he ſhould fall and be raiſed again and ſaved by Chriſt. But this he knew not at all. 2. Experience tels us that the greateſt part of Chriſtians on earth do enjoy that Peace and Comfort which they have, without any Certainty of their Salvation. 3. The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing telleth us, that a likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of ſo great a mercy as everlaſting Glory muſt needs be a ground of great Comfort. If a poor condemned priſoner do but hear that there is Hopes of a pardon, ſpecially if very probable, it will glad his heart. Indeed if an Angel from Heaven were brought into this ſtate it would be ſad to him: But if a devil or a condemned ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner have ſuch Hope, it muſt needs be glad news to them. The devils have it not, but we have.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:57538:118"/>3. Let me next therefore intreat you to take the Comfort of your Probabilities of Grace and Salvation. Your horſe or dog knoweth not how you will uſe them Certainly; yet will they lovingly follow you, and put their heads to your hand, and truſt you with their lives without fear, and love to be in your company; becauſe they have found you kinde to them, and have tried that you do them no hurt, but good: yea though you do ſtrike them ſometimes, yet they finde that they have their food from you, and your favour doth ſuſtain them. Yea your little children have no Certainty how you will uſe them; and yet finding that you have alwaies uſed them kindly, and expreſſed Love to them, though you whip them ſometimes, yet are glad of your company, and deſire to be in your lap, and can truſt themſelves in your hands, without tormenting themſelves with ſuch doubts as theſe, <hi>I am uncertain how my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will uſe me, whether ſhe will wound me, or kill me, or turn me out of doors and let me periſh.</hi> Nature perſwades us not to be too diſtruſtfull of thoſe that have alwaies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended us, and eſpecially whoſe Nature is Mercifull and Compaſſionate: Nor to be too ſuſpitious of evil from them that have alwaies done us good: Every man knows
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57538:119"/>
that the Good will do good, and the Evil will do evil: and accordingly we expect that they ſhould do to us. Naturally we all fear a Toad, a Serpent, an Adder, a mad Dog, a wicked Man, a mad Man, a cruel blood thirſty Tyrant, and the Devil: But no one fears a Dove, a Lamb, a good Man, a mercifull compaſſionate Governour, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept only the Rebels or notorious offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that know he is bound in juſtice to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy or puniſh them. And none ſhould fear diſtruſtfully the wrath of a gracious God, but they who Will not ſubmit to his Mercy, and Will not have Chriſt to reign over them, and therefore may know that he is bound in Juſtice, if they come not in, to deſtroy them. But for you that would be Obedient and Reformed, and are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that you are no better, and beg of God to make you better, and have no ſin, but what you would be glad to be rid of, may not you, at leaſt, ſee a ſtrong Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility that it ſhall go well with you? O make uſe therefore of this Probability: and if you have but Hopes that God will do you good, rejoice in thoſe Hopes, till you can come to rejoyce in Aſſurance.</p>
               <p>And here let me tell you that Probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are of divers Degrees according to their divers Grounds. Where men have but a little
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57538:119"/>
Probability of their Sincerity, and a greater Probability that they are not Sincere in the faith, theſe men may be ſomewhat born up, but it behoves them preſently to ſearch in fear, and to amend that which is the cauſe of their fear. Thoſe that have more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of the Sincerity of their hearts, then of the contrary, may well have more peace then trouble of minde: Thoſe that have yet a higher Degree of Probability may live in more Joy: and ſo according to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Probability may their Comforts ſtill ariſe.</p>
               <p>And obſerve alſo, that it is but the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Degree of this Probability here which we call a <hi>Certainty:</hi> For it is a Moral Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and not that which is called <hi>a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Divine faith,</hi> nor that which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>a Certainty of evidence</hi> in the ſtricteſt ſenſe; though yet evidence there is for it: But it is the ſame evidences materially which are the ground of Probability and of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty: Only ſometime they differ Gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally (one having more Grace and another leſs) and ſometime not ſo neither: for he that hath more Grace may diſcern but a Probability in it (through ſome other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect) no more then he that hath leſs: But when one man diſcerns his Graces and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity but darkly, he hath but a Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57538:120"/>
of Salvation manifeſted by them: and when another diſcerneth them more clearly, he hath a ſtronger Probability: and he that diſcerneth them moſt clearly (if other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries concurre) hath that which we call a Certainty.</p>
               <p>Now I am perſwaded that you frequently ſee a ſtrong Probability of your Sincerity: and may not that be a very great ſtay and comfort to your ſoul? Nay may it not draw out your heart in Love, Delight and Thankfulneſs? Suppoſe that your name were written in a piece of paper, and put among a hundred, or fifty, or but twenty other like papers into a Lottery; and you were certain that you ſhould be the owner of this whole Land except your name were drawn the firſt time, and if it were drawn, you ſhould die: Would your Joy or your Sorrow for this be the greater? Nay if it were but ten to one, or but two to one odds on your ſide, it would keep you from droo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and diſcouragement: And why ſhould it not do ſo in the preſent caſe?</p>

                  <p n="17">17. <hi>My next advice to you is this,</hi> For the ſtrengthening your apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Probability of your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.

               </argument>
               <p>WE do God and our ſelves a great deal of wrong by forgetting, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting and not improving our Experiences. How doth God charge it on the Iſraelites, eſpecially in the wilderneſs, that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got the Works of God, by which he had ſo often manifeſted his Power and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. &amp; 107. ſee 105, 106. When God had by one Miracle ſilenced their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, they had forgotten it in the next diſtreſs. It was a ſign the diſciples hearts were hardened when they forgot the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the loaves, and preſently after were diſtruſtfull and afraid, <hi>Mar.</hi> 6.52. God
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57538:121"/>
doth not give us his <hi>mercies</hi> only for the preſent <hi>uſe,</hi> but for the future: nor only for the body, but for the ſoul. I would this truth were well learned by Believers. You are in ſickneſs, in troubles, and dangers, and pinching ſtraits, in fears and anguiſh of minde: In this caſe you cry to God for help, and he doth in ſuch a manner deliver you, as ſilenceth your diſtruſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth you of his love; at leaſt of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to do you good. What a wrong is it now to God and your ſelf to forget this preſently, and in the next temptation to receive no ſtrengthening by the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it? Doth God ſo much regard this dirty fleſh, that he ſhould do all this meerly for its eaſe and relief? No, he doth it to kill your unbelief, and convince you of his ſpecial Providence, his care of you, and love to you, and power to help you, and to breed in you more loving, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and thankfull thoughts of him: Loſe this benefit and you loſe all: You may thus uſe one and the ſame Mercy a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times. Though it be gone as to the body; it is ſtill freſh in a believing, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, carefull ſoul. You may make as good uſe of it at your very death, as the firſt hour. But O the ſad forgetfulneſs, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability and unbelief of theſe hearts of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57538:121"/>
ours! What a number of theſe choice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences do we all receive? When we forget one, God giveth another, and we forget that too: When unbelief doth blaſphemouſly ſuggeſt to us, <hi>Such a thing may come once or twice by chance.</hi> God ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth one experience to another, till it even ſhame us out of our unbelief, as Chriſt ſhamed <hi>Thomas,</hi> and we cry out, <hi>My Lord and My God.</hi> Hath it not been thus oft with you? Have not Mercies come ſo ſeaſonably, ſo unexpectedly, either by ſmall means, or the means themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly raiſed up; without your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning or effecting; and plainly in anſwer to prayers, that they have brought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction along with them? and you have ſeen the Name of God engraven on them? Sure it is ſo with us, when through our ſinfull negligence, we are hardly drawn to open our eyes, and ſee what God is doing. Much more might we have ſeen if we had but obſerved the workings of Providence for us. Eſpecially they that are in an afflicted ſtate, and have more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble daily uſe for God, and are awakened to ſeek him, and regard his dealings. I know a Mercy to the body is no certain evidence of Gods Love to the ſoul. But yet from ſuch experiences a Chriſtian may
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57538:122"/>
have very ſtrong Probabilities. When we find God hearing Prayers, it is a hopefull ſign that we have ſome intereſt in him. We may ſay, as <hi>Manoahs</hi> wife ſaid to him, <hi>Judg.</hi> 13.23. <hi>If the Lord had meant to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy us, he would not have received a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice at our hands, nor have done all this for us.</hi> To have God ſo near to us in all that we call upon him for, and ſo ready to relieve us; as if he could not deny an earneſt prayer, and could not endure to ſtop his ears againſt our cries and groans; theſe are hopefull ſignes that he meaneth us good. I know ſpecial Grace is the only Certain Evidence of ſpecial Love: But yet theſe kind of experiences are many times more effectual to refreſh a drooping doubting ſoul, then the ſureſt Evidences. For Evidences may be unſeen, and require a great deal of holy skill and diligence to try them, which few have: But theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences are near us, even in our bodies, and ſhew themſelves: They make all our bones ſay, <hi>Lord who is like unto thee?</hi> And it is a great advantage to have the help of ſenſe it ſelf for our Conſolation.

ſtronger hopes of cure and recovery to peace of conſcience, when you hear of ſo many that have been cured of the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe. Moreover, is it not a reviving thing, to hear Chriſtians open the Goodneſs of the Lord? and that in particulars, as upon experience they have found him to their own ſouls? To hear them tell you of ſuch notable diſcoveries of Gods ſpecial provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and care of his people, as may refell all Temptations to Atheiſm and unbelief? To hear them give you their frequent and full experiences of Gods hearing and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering their Prayers, and helping them in their diſtreſſes? Though the carnal part of the Mercy were only theirs, yet by improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſpiritual part may be yours. You may have your faith, and love, and joy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the experiences of <hi>David, Job, Paul,</hi> which are paſt ſo long ago; and by the experiences of all your Godly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as if they were your own. This is the benefit of the unity of the Church: the bleſſings of one member of the body are bleſſings to the reſt; and if one Rejoyce the reſt may Rejoyce with them, not only for their ſakes, but alſo for their own. Such as God is to the reſt of his children, ſuch he is and will be to you. He is as ready to pity you as them; and to hear your complaints
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:57538:123"/>
and moans as theirs. And leſt we ſhould think that none of them were ſo bad as we; he hath left us the examples of his mercies to worſe then ever we were. You never were guilty of witchcraft, and open Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, as <hi>Manaſſes</hi> was, and that for a long time, and drawing the whole Nation, and chief part of the Viſible Church on earth, into Idolatry with him. You never had your hand in the blood of a Saint, and even of the firſt Martyr (<hi>Stephen</hi>) as <hi>Paul</hi> had: You never hunted after the blood of the Saints, and perſecuted them from City to City as he did: And yet God did not only forgive him, but was found of him when he never ſought him, yea when he was perſecuting him in his Members, and kick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the pricks; yea and made him a choſen Veſſel to bear about his Name, and as noble an Inſtrument of the Propagation of his Goſpel, as if he had never been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of any ſuch crimes: that he might be an encouraging example to the <hi>unworthieſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> and in him might appear the riches of his Mercy, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13, 16. ſee alſo <hi>Titus</hi> 3.3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Is there no ground of comfort in theſe examples of the Saints? The ſame we may ſay of the experiences of Gods people ſtill: And doubtleſs it were well if experimentall Chriſtians did more
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57538:124"/>
fully and frequently open to one another their experiences. It were the way to make private particular Mercies, to be more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and common Mercies; and to give others a part in our bleſſings without any diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them to our ſelves. Not that I would have this ſo openly and raſhly done, (by thoſe who through their diſability to expreſs their mindes, do make the works and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of their Spirit ſeem ridiculous to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ears) as I perceive ſome in a very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality would have it, (as if it muſt be one of their Church cuſtoms, to ſatisfie the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of the fitneſs of each member before they will receive them:) But I would have Chriſtians that are ſit to expreſs their minds, to do it in ſeaſon and with wiſdom: Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe to whom God hath given any more eminent and notable experiments, which may be of publick uſe. Doubtleſs God hath loſt very much of the honour due to his Name, and poor Chriſtians much of the benefit which they might have received, (and may challenge by the mutual intereſt of fellow-members) for want of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like communication of the extraordinary and more notable experiences of ſome men. Thoſe that write the lives of the holieſt men when they are dead, can give you but the outſide and carkaſs of their Memorials;
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:57538:124"/>
The moſt obſervable paſſages are uſually ſecret, known only to God and their own ſouls; which none but themſelves are able to communicate. For my own part, I do ſoberly and ſeriouſly profeſs to you, that the experiences I have had of Gods ſpecial Providences, and Fatherly care, and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of his hearing prayers, have been ſo ſtrange and great and exceeding numerous, that they have done very much to the quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my ſpirit, and the perſwading my ſoul of Gods Love to me, and the ſilencing and ſhaming of my unbelieving heart, and eſpecially for the conquering of all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that lead to Atheiſm or Infidelity, to the denying of ſpecial Providence, or or the verity of the Goſpel, or of the Neceſſity of holy Prayer and worſhipping of God. Yea thoſe paſſages that in the bulk of the thing ſeem to have no great matter in them, yet have come at ſuch ſeaſons, in ſuch a manner, in evident anſwer to prayers, that they have done much to my confirmation. O happy Afflictions and Diſtreſſes! Sufferings and Danger force us to Pray, and force the cold and cuſtomary Petitioner to ſeriouſneſs and importunity. Importunate Prayers bring evident returns: ſuch returns give us ſenſible experiences: ſuch experiences raiſe faith, love, and thankfulneſs; kill unbelief
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57538:125"/>
and Atheiſm; and encourage the ſoul in all diſtreſſes, to go the ſame way as when it ſped ſo well. I often pity the poor ſeduced Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels of this age that deny Scripture and Chriſt himſelf, and doubt of the uſefulneſs of Prayer and holy Worſhip; and I wiſh that they had but the experiences that I have had. O how much more might it do then all their Studies and Diſputes! Truly I have once or twice had motions in my mind to have publikely and freely communicated my experiences in a Relation of the more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable paſſages of my Life: But I found that I was not able to do it to Gods praiſe as was meet, without a ſhew of oſtentation and vanity, and therefore I forbore.</p>

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:57538:126"/>
yet for the Application of it. But firſt I muſt briefly tell you the meaning of the words. 1. God commandeth us all to believe (wicked and godly) that our ſins are made pardonable by the ſufficient ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Chriſt for them; and that God is very mercifull and ready to forgive: and that he hath conditionally forgiven us all in the New Covenant, making a deed of gift of Chriſt and pardon and Life in him to all, on condition they Believe in him and Accept what is given. 2. But no man is commanded to Believe that he is Actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgiven. 3. Therefore I ſay our Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is not ſtrictly to be called Belief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or a Certainty of Belief. For it is only our Certain Belief of thoſe things which we take on the meer credit of the Witneſſer or Revealer, which we call, Certainty of Faith. Indeed we commonly in Engliſh uſe the word Belief to expreſs any confident, but uncertain opinion or perſwaſion: And if any will ſo take it, then I deny not but our Aſſurance is a Belief. But it is commonly taken by Divines for an Aſſent to any thing on the credit of the word of the Revealer; and ſo is diſtinguiſhed both from the ſenſible Apprehenſion of things, and from Principles that are known by the meer Light and help of Nature; and from
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57538:126"/>
the Knowledge of Concluſions which by Reaſoning we gather from thoſe Principles. Though yet one and the ſame thing may be Known as Revealed in Nature, and Believed as Revealed Immediatly of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally. And ſo we both Know and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there is one onely God, who made and preſerveth All things. 4. But our Aſſurance is an Act of Knowledge, participating of Faith and internal ſenſe or Knowledge reflect. For Divine Faith ſaith, <hi>He that Believeth is Juſtified and ſhall be Saved.</hi> Internal ſenſe and knowledge of our ſelves ſaith, <hi>But I Believe.</hi> Reaſon, or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſive Knowledge ſaith, <hi>Therefore I am Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified and ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Only I muſt adviſe you, that you be not troubled when you meet with that which is contrary to this in any great Divines: For it is only our former Divines whoſe Judgements were partly hurt by hot Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations with the Papiſts herein, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not come to that maturity as others ſince them have had opportunity to do. And therefore in their expoſitions of the Creed and ſuch like paſſages in the Text, they eagerly inſiſt on it, that when we ſay, We <hi>Believe the Forgiveneſs of ſin, and Life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting,</hi> every man is to profeſs that he Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth that his own ſinnes are forgiven,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57538:127"/>
and he ſhall have Life everlaſting himſelf. But our later Divines, and ſpecially the Engliſh, and moſt eſpecially theſe that deal moſt in Practicals, do ſee the miſtake, and lay down the ſame doctrine which I teach you here, God bids us not Believe as from him, more then he hath revealed. But only one of the Propoſitions is revealed by Gods Teſtimony, <hi>He that Believeth ſhall be Saved.</hi> But it is no where written that <hi>You do Believe,</hi> nor that <hi>You ſhall be Saved</hi>; nor any thing equivalent. And therefore you are not commanded to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve either of theſe. How the Spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth theſe, I have fully told you alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. In our Creed therefore we do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to Believe Remiſſion of ſinnes to be Purchaſed by Chriſts death, and in his Power to give, and Given in the Goſpel to All on Condition of Believing in Chriſt himſelf for Remiſſion: But not to Believe that our own ſinnes are Actually and Fully Pardoned.</p>
               <p>My end in telling you this again (which I have told you elſewhere) is this, That you may not think (as I finde abundance of poor troubled ſouls to do) that Faith (much leſs juſtifying Faith) is a Believing that you have true Grace, and ſhall be ſaved; And ſo fall a condemning your
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57538:127"/>
ſelf unjuſtly every time that you doubt of your own Sincerity; and think that ſo much as you doubt of this, ſo much unbelief you have: and ſo many poor ſouls complain that they have no faith, or but little, and that they cannot Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, becauſe they Believe not their own Faith to be Sincere: and when they wholly judge themſelves unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, then they call that Deſperation, which they think to be a ſinne incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with true Grace. Theſe are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Errours, all ariſing from that one Errour which the heat of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did carry ſome good men to, that Faith is a Belief that our ſinnes are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given by Chriſt. Indeed all men are bound to apply Chriſt and the Promiſe to themſelves. But that application con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in a Belief that this Promiſe is true as belonging to all, and ſo to me, and then in Acceptance of Chriſt and his benefits as an offered gift; and after this in Truſting on him for the full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his Promiſe. Hence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you may beſt ſee what Unbelief and Deſperation are, and how farre men may charge themſelves with them. When you doubt whether the Promiſe be True, or when you refuſe to Accept
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:57538:128"/>
Chriſt and his Benefits offered in it, and conſequently to Truſt him as one that is Able and Willing to ſave you, if you do Aſſent to his Truth and Accept him; this is Unbelief. But if you do Believe the Truth of the Goſpel, and are heartily Willing to Accept Chriſt as offered in it, and only Doubt whether your Belief and Acceptance of him be ſincere, and ſo whether you ſhall be ſaved, this is not Unbelief, but igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of your own Sincerity, and its conſequents. Nay, and though that Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance be wanting which is a part of Faith, yet it is but a hindering of the exerciſe of it, for want of a neceſſary concomitant condition; for the Grace of Affiance in the Habit and Virtually is there: ſo that it is not formally Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt or Unbelief, any more then your not Truſting God in your ſleep is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt. If a friend do Promiſe to give you a hundred pound on condition that you thankfully Accept it: If you now do Believe him, and do thankfully Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it; but yet through ſome vain ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall think <hi>My thankefulneſs is ſo ſmall that it is not ſincere, and therefore I doubt, I do not perform his condition, and ſo ſhall never have the gift.</hi> In this
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:57538:128"/>
caſe now, you do Believe your friend and you do not Diſtruſt him properly; but you Diſtruſt your ſelf, that you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form not the condition; and this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth the exerciſe of that Confidence or Affiance in your friend which is habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and virtually in you. Juſt ſo is it in our preſent caſe.</p>
               <p>The ſame may be ſaid of Deſperation, which is a Privation of Hope: When we have Believed the Truth of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and Accepted Chriſt offered, we are then bound to Hope that God will give us the Benefits promiſed: So hope is nothing but <hi>A Deſirous expectation</hi> of the good ſo promiſed and believed. Now if you begin to Diſtruſt whether God will make good this promiſe or no, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinking that it is not True, or he is not able, or hath changed his minde ſince the making of it, and on theſe grounds you let go your Hopes, this is Deſpair. If becauſe that Chriſt ſeems to Delay his coming, we ſhould ſay, I have waited in Hope till now, but now I am out of Hope that ever Chriſt will come to Judge the world and Glorifie Believers, I will expect it no longer: this is Deſpair. And it hath its ſeveral Degrees more or leſs, as unbelief hath.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57538:129"/>
Indeed the Schoolmen ſay that Affiance is nothing but ſtrengthened Hope. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance in the propereſt ſenſe is the ſame in ſubſtance with Hope; only it more expreſſeth a Reſpect to the Promiſe and Promiſer, and indeed is Faith and Hope expreſt both together in one word. So that what I ſaid before of Diſtruſt, is true of Deſpair. If you do continue to Believe the Truth of the Goſpel, and particularly of Chriſts coming and glorifying his Saints, and yet you think he will not glorifie you becauſe you think that you are not a true Believer or Saint; This is not Deſperation in the proper ſenſe. For Deſperation is the privation of Hope, where the formal cauſe, the heart and life of it is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. But you have here Hope in the Habit, and Virtually do Hope in Chriſt: but the Act of it as to your own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſalvation is hindered, upon an accidentall miſtake. In the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned example, If your friend Promiſe to give you a hundred pound on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your thankfull Acceptance, and promiſeth to come at ſuch an hour and bring it you: If now you ſtay till the hour be almoſt come, and then ſay, <hi>I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m out of Hope of his coming now; he
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:57538:129"/>
hath broke his word</hi>; this is properly a Deſpair in your friend. But if you on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think that you have overſtaid the time, and that it is paſt, and therefore you ſhall not have the gift, this may be called a Deſpair of the event, and a Deſpair of your ſelf; but not properly a Deſpair in your friend; only the Act of Hoping in God is hindered as is ſaid. So it is in our preſent caſe. Men may be ſaid to Deſpair of their Salvation, and to Deſpair in themſelves, but not to Deſpair in God, except the formal cauſe of ſuch Deſpair were there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and except they are drawn to it, by not believing his Truth and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. The true nature of Deſpair is expreſt in that of the Apoſtles, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.21. <hi>We truſted that this was he that ſhould Redeem Iſrael:</hi> Only it was but imperfect Deſpair: elſe it had been dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. Their hopes were ſhaken. And for my part, I am perſwaded that it is only this proper Deſpair in God, which is the damnable Deſperation, which is threatned in the Scripture: and not the former: And that if a poor ſoul ſhould go out of this world without any Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Hope of his own Salvation, meerly becauſe he thinks that he is no true
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:57538:130"/>
Believer, that this Soul may be ſaved, and prove a true Believer for all this. Alas, the great ſin that God threatneth is our Diſtruſt of his Faithfulneſs, and not the doubting of our own ſincerity and Diſtruſt of our ſelves. We have great reaſon to be very jealous of our own hearts, as knowing them to be Deceitfull above all things and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately wicked, who can know them? But we have no reaſon at all to be Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of God. Where finde you in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that any is condemned for hard thoughts of themſelves, or for not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves to have true Grace; and for thinking they had none? It is true unbelief in Gods Promiſe that men are condemned for: even that ſinne which is an Averſion of the Soul from God. But perhaps you will ask, Is doubting of our own ſincerity and Salvation no ſin? I anſwer, Doubting is either taken in oppoſition to Believing; or in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to knowing or to conjecturing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Doubting as it ſignifieth only A <hi>not-believing</hi> that our ſins are pardoned and we ſhall be ſaved, is no ſinne (ſtill remember that I take Believing in the ſtrict proper ſenſe, for <hi>The Crediting of a Divine Teſtimony or Aſſertion</hi>) For
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:57538:130"/>
God hath no where commanded us or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily to Believe either of theſe. I ſay <hi>Ordinarily</hi> (as I did in the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before) becauſe when Chriſt was on earth he told a man perſonally <hi>Thy ſinnes are forgiven thee</hi> (whether he meant only as to the preſent diſeaſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for them, or alſo all puniſhment, Temporal and Eternal, I will not now diſcuſs) ſo <hi>Nathan</hi> from God told <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, His ſinne was forgiven:</hi> But theſe were Priviledges only to theſe perſons, and not common to all. God hath no where ſaid, either that All mens ſinnes are actually forgiven; or that yours or mine by name are forgiven: But only that All that Believe are forgiven: which ſuppoſeth them to Believe before they are forgiven, and that they may be forgiven; and therefore it is not true that they are forgiven before they Believe: and therefore this faith is not a Believing <hi>that they are forgiven,</hi> but a Believing on Chriſt for forgiveneſſe. Elſe men muſt Believe an Untruth to make it become True by their Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But now, <hi>Doubting,</hi> as it is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of our Remiſſion and Juſtification, in thoſe that are Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:57538:131"/>
is a ſinne: (For it can be no ſinne for an unjuſtified perſon to know that he is unjuſtified.) But then, I pray you mark, how farre it is a ſinne in the Godly, and what manner of ſin it is. 1. It is a ſinne as it is part of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ignorance and original Depraved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Underſtandings, or a fruit hereof and of our ſtrangeneſs to our own hearts, and of their deep Deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, Confuſion, Mutability or Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence. 2. And further as all theſe are increaſed by long cuſtom in ſinning, and ſo the diſcerning of our ſtates is become more difficult, it is yet a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſinne. 3. It is a ſinne as it is the fruit of any particular ſinne by which we have obſcured our own graces, and provoked God to hide his face from us. And ſo all ignorance of any Truth which we ought to know, is a ſinne, ſo the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of our own Regeneration and ſincerity is a ſinne, becauſe we ought to know it. But this is ſo farre from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great condemning ſinne of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief which Chriſt threatneth in his New Law, that it is none of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt or moſt hainous ſort of ſinnes, but the infirmity in ſome meaſure of every Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:57538:131"/>And let me further acquaint you with this difference between theſe <hi>Doubtings,</hi> and your <hi>Fears and Sorrows</hi> that follow thereupon. Though the Doubting it ſelf be your ſin, yet I ſuppoſe that the Fears and Sorrows and Cares that follow it may be your Duty. Yet Reſpectively and by remote participation even theſe alſo muſt be acknowledged ſinfull; even as our prayers for that pardon which we have received and knew it not, may by remote participation be called ſinfull: becauſe if we had not ſinned we ſhould not have been ignorant of our own hearts: and if we had not been igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant we ſhould not have Doubted of the leaſt true Grace we have: and if we had not ſo Doubted, we ſhould not have Feared or Sorrowed or Prayed for that Remiſſion in that ſenſe. But yet though theſe may be called ſinfull, as they come from ſin, yet more neerly and in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves conſidered on ſuppoſition of our preſent eſtate, they are all Duties, and great Duties neceſſary to our Salvation. You may ſay to a Thief that begs for pardon, <hi>If thou hadſt not ſtoln thou hadſt not need to have beg'd pardon.</hi> Yet ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that he hath ſtoln it may be his Duty to beg pardon. And ſo you may
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:57538:132"/>
ſay to a poor fearing ſoul, that fears Damnation and Gods wrath, <hi>Thou need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not fear if thou hadſt not ſinned.</hi> But when he hath once by ſin obſcured his evidences, and neceſſitated Doubting, then is fear and ſorrow and praying for Juſtification and pardon, his Duty: And indeed not fitly to be called ſin, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a fruit of ſin in one reſpect (and ſo hath ſome participation in it) but a fruit of the Spirit and of Chriſts command in another reſpect, and ſo a neceſſary Duty. For elſe we ſhould ſay, that it is a ſin to Repent and Believe in Chriſt, and to love him as Redeemer: For you may ſay to any ſinner, <hi>Thou needeſt not to have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, Believed in a Redeemer,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but for thy ſin</hi>; Yet I hope none will ſay that ſo doing is properly a ſin, though doing them defectively is. God doth not will and approve of it, that any ſoul that can ſee no ſignes of Grace and ſincerity in it ſelf, ſhould yet be as confident, and merry and careleſs, as if they were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that all were well. God would not have men doubt of his Love, and yet make light of it: This is a contempt of him. Elſe what ſhould poor carnall ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners do that finde themſelves unſanctified. No nor doth God expect that any man
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:57538:132"/>
ſhould judge of himſelf better then he hath evidence to warrant ſuch a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But that every man ſhould prove his own work that ſo he may have rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in himſelf alone, and not in another. For he that thinketh he is ſomething when he is nothing, deceiveth himſelf, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.3, 4, 5, 6. And no man ſhould be a ſelf-deceiver, eſpecially in a caſe of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible conſequence. It is therefore a moſt deſperate doctrine of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians (as moſt of theirs are) that all men ought to believe Gods ſpecial Love to them, and their own Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and that they are juſtified by Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that they were juſtified before: and that no man ought to queſtion his faith (ſaith <hi>Saltmarſh,</hi> any more then to queſtion Chriſt:) and that all fears of our Damnation, or not being Juſtified after this Believing, are ſinne: and thoſe that perſwade to them, are Preachers of the Law. (How punctually do the moſt prophane ungodly people, hold moſt points of the Antinomian belief, though they never knew that Sect by name!) God commandeth no man to Believe more then is true: nor immediatly to caſt away their doubts and fears; but to overcome them in an orderly metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:57538:133"/>
way: that is, uſing Gods means till their Graces become more diſcernable, and their underſtandings more clear and fit to diſcern them, that ſo we may have Aſſurance of their ſincerity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, of our Juſtification, Adoption, and right to Glorification. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Let us therefore fear leaſt a Promiſe being left of entring into his Reſt, any of us ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it.</hi> Pſal. 2.11. <hi>Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoyce before him with trembling. Kiſs the Sonne leſt he be angry and ye periſh.</hi> Phil. 2.12. <hi>Work out your ſalvation with fear and trembling.</hi> Not only 1. A reverent fear of Gods Majeſty. 2. And a filial fear of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him. 3. And an awfull fear of his Judgements, when we ſee them executed on others, and hear them threatned. 4. And a filial fear of temporal chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and lawfull and our duty: but alſo 5. A fear of damnation exciting to moſt carefull importunity to eſcape it; when ever we have ſo far obſcured our evidences, as to ſee no ſtrong probability of our ſincerity in the faith, and ſo of our ſalvation. The ſumme of my ſpeech there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is this: Do not think that all your fears of Gods wrath are your ſins: Much of them is your great duty. Do you not
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:57538:133"/>
feel that God made theſe fears at your firſt converſion, the firſt and a principal means of your Recovery? to drive you to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſideration of your ſtate and waies, and to look after Chriſt with more longing and eſtimation? and to uſe the means with more reſolution and diligence? Have not theſe fears been chief preſervers of your diligence and integrity ever ſince? I know love ſhould do more then it doth with us all: But if we had not daily uſe for both (Love and Fear) God would not 1. Have planted them both in our natures. 2. And have renewed them both by regenerating Grace. 3. And have put into his word the objects to move both (<hi>viz.</hi> Threatnings as well as Promiſes) That fear of God which is the beginning of wiſdom includeth the fear of his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned wrath. I could ſay abundance more to prove this, but that I know as to you it is needleſs for conviction of it: but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the uſe of it. Do not put the name of unbelief upon all your fears of Gods diſpleaſure. Much leſs ſhould you preſently conclude that you have no faith, and that you cannot believe, becauſe of theſe fears. You may have much faith in the midſt of theſe fears; and God may make them preſervers of your faith, by
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57538:134"/>
quickning you up to that means that muſt maintain it, and by keeping you from thoſe evils that would be as a worm at the root of it, and eat out its precious ſtrength and life. Security is no friend to faith; but a deadlier enemy then fear it ſelf. <hi>Obj.</hi> Then <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> ſinned not by deſpairing: or at leaſt not damnably. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. They deſpaired not only of themſelves, and of the event of their ſalvation, but alſo of God; of his Power or Goodneſs, and Promiſe, and the ſufficiency of any ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Chriſt. Their infidelity was the root of their deſpair. 2. Farre is it from me to ſay or think that you ſhould deſpair of the event, or that it is no ſin; yea or that you ſhould cheriſh cauſeleſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive jealouſies and fears: I ſhall ſhew you towards the end, the ſinfulneſs of ſo doing. Take heed of all fears that drive you from God, or that diſtract or weaken your ſpirit, or diſable you from duty, or drown your love to God, and delight in him, and deſtroy your apprehenſions of Gods Lovelineſs and Compaſſion, and raiſe black and hard, and unworthy thoughts of God in your minde. Again, I intreat you avoid and abhorre all ſuch fears. But if you find in you the fears of godly jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of your own heart, and ſuch modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:57538:134"/>
fears of the wrath of God, which ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſecurity, preſumption and boldneſs in ſinning, and are (as D. <hi>Sibbs</hi> cals them) the awe-band of your ſoul; and make you fly to the merits and boſom of the Lord Jeſus, as the affrighted child to the lap of the mother, and as the man-ſlayer under the Law to the City of refuge, and as a man purſued by a Lion, to his Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary or hold; do not think you have no faith becauſe you have theſe fears; but moderate them by faith and love, and then thank God for them. Indeed <hi>Perfect love</hi> (which will be in heaven when all is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected) will caſt out this fear; and ſo it will do ſorrow and care, and prayer and means. But ſee you lay not theſe by till <hi>Perfect love</hi> have caſt them out. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.22, 23. &amp; <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. two laſt verſes. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we receiving a Kingdom which cannot be moved, let us ſerve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.

the prevalency of Temptations, and the hidings of Gods face, their ſouls
are oft left in a ſtate of ſadneſs, that were but lately as in the arms of Chriſt. How fully might this be proved from the examples of <hi>Job, David, Jeremy</hi> and others in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture? and much more abundantly by the daily complaints and examples of the beſt of Gods people now living among us. As there is no perfect <hi>evenneſs</hi> to be expected in our obedience while we are on earth; ſo neither will there be any conſtant or perfect <hi>evenneſs</hi> in our comforts. He that hath life in one duty, is cold in the next: and therefore he that hath much joy in one duty, hath little in the next. Yea perhaps duty may but occaſion the renewall of his ſorrows; that the ſoul who before felt not its own burden, at a Sermon, or in Prayer, or holy Meditation, which were wont to revive him, now ſeems to feel his miſeries to be multiplied. The time was once with <hi>David,</hi> when the thoughts of God were ſweet to him, and he could ſay, <hi>In the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of my thoughts within me, thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts delight my ſoul:</hi> And yet he ſaw the time alſo, When he remembred God and was troubled, he complained and his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was overwhelmed: God ſo held his eyes waking, that he was troubled and

could not ſpeak: he conſidered the daies of old, and the years of ancient time; he called to remembrance his ſong in the night, he communed with his own heart, and his ſpirit made diligent ſearch: <hi>Will the Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>caſt off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?

                  <p n="20">20. <hi>Let me alſo give you this warning, That</hi> You muſt never expect ſo much Aſſurance on earth, as ſhall ſet you above a Poſſibility of the loſs of Heaven, or above all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of real danger of your miſcarrying.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Conceive this advertiſement to be of great neceſſity. But I muſt firſt tell you the meaning and then the reaſons of it. Only I am ſorry that I know not how to expreſs it fully, but in School terms which are not ſo familiar to you. 1. That which ſhall certainly come to paſs, we call a thing [<hi>Future</hi>]. That which May and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:57538:137"/>
Can be Done, we call [<hi>Poſſible.</hi>] <hi>All</hi> things are not Future which are Poſſible: God <hi>can</hi> do more then he <hi>hath</hi> done or <hi>will</hi> do. He could have made more worlds, and ſo more were Poſſible then were Future. Moreover a thing is ſaid to be Poſſible, in reference to ſome Power which can accompliſh it: whether it be Gods Power, or Angels, or mans. God hath Decreed that none of his Elect ſhall finally or totally fall away and periſh: and therefore their ſo falling and periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not-future, that is, It is a thing that ſhall never come to paſs: But God never Decreed that it ſhould be utterly <hi>Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and therefore it ſtill remaineth Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, though it ſhall never come to paſs. <hi>Obj.</hi> But it is ſaid, <hi>They ſhall deceive if it were Poſſible the very Elect.</hi> A moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable place, which many oppoſers of Election and Free-grace, do in vain ſeek to obſcure. But let me tell you for the right underſtanding of it, 1. That as I ſaid, [<hi>Poſſible</hi>] and [<hi>Impoſſible</hi>] are Relative terms, and have Relation to the Power of ſome Agent, as proportioned to the thing to be Done: Now this Text ſpeaks only of the power of falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophets (and the devil by them) Their power of Deceiving is exceeding
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:57538:137"/>
great, but not great enough to Deceive the Elect: which is true in two Reſpects, 1. Becauſe the Elect are guided and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by Gods Spirit. 2. Becauſe ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers work not efficiently, but finally, by propounding objects; or by a Morall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper efficiency only. All their ſeduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments cannot force or neceſſitate us to be Deceived by them. But though it be impoſſible to them to do it; yet it is Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God to permit (which yet he never will) and ſo Poſſible for our ſelves to be our own Deceivers, or to give Deceivers ſtrength againſt us, by a wilfull receiving of their poyſoned baits. 2. Beſides Chriſt ſpoke not in <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> School, but among the Vulgar, where words muſt be uſed in the common ſenſe, or elſe they will not be underſtood: And the Vulgar uſe to call that <hi>Impoſſible</hi> which ſhall never come to paſs.</p>
               <p>And indeed when we ſay that it is Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, or Impoſſible for a man to ſin or fall away, there is ſome degree of Impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in the Terms; becauſe <hi>Poſſible</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible</hi> are terms properly relating to ſome power apportioned to a work: but ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and falling away thereby, are the conſequents of impotency, and not the effects of Power: except we ſpeak of the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:57538:138"/>
natural act, wherein the ſin abideth. But this muſt be born with, for want of a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter word to expreſs our meaning by. But I'le leave theſe things which are not fit for you, and deſire you to leave them and overpaſs them, if you underſtand them not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I here told you alſo, that you muſt not look to be above all apprehenſion of danger of your miſcarrying. The grounds of this are theſe: 1. Becauſe, as is ſaid, our miſcarrying remaineth ſtill Poſſible. 2. Becauſe the perfect certain knowledge of our Election, and that we ſhall not fall away, is proper to God only: We have our ſelves but a Defective, interrupted Aſſurance of it. 3. The Covenant gives us ſalvation but on condition of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, and perſeverance on conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that we quench not the Spirit: which we ſhall do, if we loſe the apprehenſion of our danger. 4. Accordingly there is a connexion in our Aſſurance, between all the ſeveral cauſes of our Salvation, and neceſſaries thereto; whereof the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of danger is one. We are ſure we ſhall be ſaved, if we be ſure to Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere: elſe not. We are ſure to Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, if we be ſure faithfully to reſiſt Temptations. We can be no ſurer of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:57538:138"/>
faithfull reſiſting of Temptations, then we are ſure to be kept in an apprehenſion of our danger.</p>
               <p>I ſtill ſay therefore that the Doctrine of Antinomians is the moſt ready way to Apoſtacy and perdition: and no wonder if it lead to the Licentiouſneſs and Scandals which our eyes have ſeen to be its genuine fruits! They cry down the weakneſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief and folly of poor Chriſtians, that will apprehend themſelves in danger of falling away, and ſo live in fear, after they are once Juſtified; and that if they fall into ſin (as whoredom, drunkenneſs, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Perjury, deſtroying the Miniſtry, and expelling the Goſpel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently queſtion or fear their eſtates and their Juſtification. Such like paſſages I lately read in ſome printed Sermons of one of my ancient acquaintance, who would never have come to that paſs that he is at now, if his Judgement and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity had been as great as his Zeal. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you therefore never to expect ſuch an Aſſurance as ſhall extinguiſh all your apprehenſions of danger. He that ſees not the danger, is neereſt it and likely to fall into it. Only he that ſeeth and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth it, is likely to avoid it. He that ſeeth no danger of falling away, is in
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:57538:139"/>
greateſt danger of it. I doubt not but thats the cauſe of the Seditions, Scandals, Hereſies, Bloodguiltineſs, Deſtroying of the Churches of Chriſt, and moſt Horrid Apoſtacies, Hypocriſie and wickedneſs, which theſe late times have been guilty of; that they apprehended not the danger of ever coming into ſuch a ſtate, or ever do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch things, but would have ſaid, <hi>Am I a Dog?</hi> to him that ſhould have foretold them what is come to paſs. Wonderfull! that men ſhould be ſo blinded by falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as not to know, that the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of danger is made in the very fabrication of the nature of man, to be the very engine to move his ſoul in all waies of ſelf-preſervation and ſalvation! Yea it is that very ſuppoſed principle, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which all the Government of the world, and the Laws and order of every Nation, are grounded. We could not keep the very Bruits from tearing us in pieces, but for their own ſafety: becauſe they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend themſelves to be in danger by it! The fear of man is it that reſtraineth them. But for this, no mans life would be in any ſafety. For every malicious man would be a murderer: He that feareth not the loſs of his own life, is maſter of another mans. Do theſe men think that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:57538:139"/>
of bodily dangers may carry them on through all undertakings, and be the potent ſpring of moſt of their actions, and warrant all thoſe courſes that elſe would be unwarrantable, ſo that they dare plead <hi>Neceſſity</hi> to warrant thoſe fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things which by extenuating language (like <hi>Sauls</hi>) are called <hi>Irregularities</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And yet that it is unlawfull or unmeet for a Chriſtian, yea the weakeſt Chriſtian, to live in any apprehenſions of danger to their ſouls? either danger of ſinning, or falling away, or periſhing for ever? No wonder if ſuch do ſin, and fall away and periſh. Would theſe men have fought well by Sea or Land, if they had appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended no danger? Would the earth have been ſo covered with carkaſſes and with blood (yea even of Saints) and the world filled with the dolefull calamities that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied and have followed, if there had been no apprehenſions of danger? Would they take Phyſick when they are ſick? Would they avoid fire, or water, or thieves; but through an apprehenſion of danger? Let them talk what they pleaſe, if ever they eſcape hell, without a deep apprehenſion of the danger of it, it muſt be in a way not known by Scripture or by Nature. Sure I am <hi>Paul</hi> did tame his body
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:57538:140"/>
and bring it in ſubjection, through an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of this danger, leſt when he had Preached to others, himſelf ſhould be a caſt-away or reprobate, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. And Chriſt himſelf, when he biddeth us, <hi>Fear not them that can kill the body</hi> (whom yet theſe men think it lawfull to fear and fight againſt) yet chargeth us, with a double charge, ſo <hi>Fear him that is able to deſtroy both body and ſoul in hell: yea I ſay unto you,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>fear him,</hi> Luk. 12.5. What can be plainer? and that to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples? My deteſtation of theſe deſtructive Antinomian Principles, makes me to run out further againſt them then I intended: Though it were eaſie more abundantly to manifeſt their hatefulneſs: But my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are theſe: 1. Becauſe theſe Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks are ſtill thruſting in themſelves and impudently proclaiming their own skill, and the excellency of their remedies for the cure of wounded conſciences, and the ſetling of peace: when indeed their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts are rank poiſon, guilded with the pretious name of Chriſt and free-Grace. 2. Becauſe I would not have your doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings cured by the Devil; for he will but cure one diſeaſe with another, and a leſſer with a far greater. If he can ſo cure your fears and doubtings as to bring you into
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:57538:140"/>
carnal ſecurity and preſumption, he will loſe nothing by the cure, and you will get nothing. If he can turn a poor doubting troubled Chriſtian, to be a ſecure Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomian, he hath cured the ſmart of a cut finger by caſting them into a Lethargy, or ſtupefaction by his opium. To go to Antinomian receipts to cure a troubled ſoul, is as going to a Witch to cure the body. 3. I would have you ſenſible of Gods goodneſs to you in theſe very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that you have ſo long lain under. Your bleſſed Phyſician knew your diſeaſe, and the temperature of your ſoul. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he ſaw that you were in ſome danger of being carried away with the Honours, Profits or Pleaſures of this world; and would have been entangled in either co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, pride, voluptuouſneſs or ſome ſuch deſperate ſinne: And now by theſe conſtant and extraordinary apprehenſions of your danger, theſe ſinnes have been much kept under, temptations weakned, and your danger prevented. If you have found no ſuch inclinations in your ſelf, yet God might find them. Had it not been farre worſe for you to have lain ſo many years in pride, ſenſuality and forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, and utter neglect of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:57538:141"/>
you have done in apprehenſions of your danger? O love and admire your wiſe Phyſician! Little do you know now what he hath been doing for you: Nor ſhall you ever fully know it in this life: but hereafter you ſhall know it, when your ſanctification, and conſolation, and his praiſes ſhall be perfected together. 4. If you ſhould for the time to come expect or deſire that God ſhould ſet you out of all apprehenſion of danger, you know not what it is that you deſire: It were to deſire your own undoing. Only ſee that you apprehend not your danger to be greater then it is; nor ſo apprehend it as to increaſe it, by driving you from Chriſt, but as to prevent it by driving you to him. Entertain not fancies and dreams of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in ſtead of right apprehenſions. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend your happineſs and grounds of hope and comfort, and ſafety in Chriſt, and let theſe quite exceed your apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the danger. Look not on it as a remedileſs danger, or as greater then the remedy. Do not conclude that you ſhall periſh in it, and it will ſwallow you up: But only let it make you hold faſt on Chriſt, and keep cloſe to him in obedience.

The Father bids him, Bring all my Subjects with you, if they will come and hold by you; but be ſure you fail not to bring my Sons. This is reſolved on: The Prince caſteth himſelf in the water, and ſwimmeth to the further ſide: He ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a way through the Ice, and offereth all of them his ſafe carriage, if they will Accept him to be their bearer and helper, and will truſt themſelves on him, and hold faſt by him till they come to the further ſide. Some refuſe his help and think he would deceive them, and lead them into the deep and there leave them to periſh: Some had rather play on the Ice and will

not hearken to him: Some dare not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture through the ſtreams, or will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the coldneſs of the water: Some waveringly agree to him, and hold faintly by his skirt, and when they feel the cold water, or are near the deep, or are weary of holding, they loſe him; either turning back; or periſhing ſuddenly in the gulf. The children are of the ſame minde with the reſt, but he is reſolved to loſe none of them, and therefore he chargeth them to come with him, and tels them fully what a welcome they ſhall have with their Father; and ceaſeth not his importunity till he perſwade them to conſent: Some of them ſay, How ſhall we ever get over the River? we ſhall be drowned by the way: He tels them, I will carry you ſafe over; ſo you will but hold faſt by me: Never fear; I warrant you: They all lay hold on him and venture in with him. When they are in the midſt ſome are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, and cry out, We ſhall be drowned: There he encourageth, and bids them truſt him; hold faſt; and fear not. Others when they hear theſe words that they need not fear, they grow ſo bold and utterly ſecure as to loſe their hold: To theſe he ſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>keth in other language, and chargeth them to hold faſt by him, for if they loſe
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:57538:142"/>
their hold they will fall into the bottom, and if they ſtick not to him they will be drowned. Some of them upon this warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold faſt: others are ſo boldly confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of his skill and good-will and promiſe that they forget or value not his warning and threatning, but loſe their hold: Some through lazineſs and wearineſs do the like. Whereupon he lets them ſink till they are almoſt drowned and cry out for help, <hi>Save us or we periſh,</hi> and think they are all loſt: and then he laieth hold of them and fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them up again, and chideth them for their bold folly, and biddeth them look better to themſelves and hold faſter by him hereafter if they love themſelves. Some at laſt through meer wearineſs and weakneſs, before they can reach the bank, cry out, <hi>O I am tired, I faint, I ſhall never hold faſt till I reach the ſhore, I ſhall be drowned.</hi> Theſe he comforteth and gives them cordials and holdeth them by the hand, and bids them, Deſpair not: do your beſt: Hold faſt, and I will help you. And ſo he brings them all ſafe to the Haven.</p>
               <p>This King is God: Heaven is his habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: The Subjects are all men: The Sons who are part of the Subjects are the Elect: The reſt are the <hi>Non-Elect:</hi> The
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:57538:143"/>
River or Sea is the paſſage of this life. The further ſide, is all mens natural, ſinfull diſtance and ſeparation from God and happineſs: The Ice that bears them, is this frail life of Pleaſures, Profits and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours which delight the fleſh: The depth unfrozen is hell. He that ticeth them thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the devil: The eldeſt Son that is ſent to bring them over, is Jeſus Chriſt. His Commiſſion and undertaking is, to help all over that refuſe not his Help; and to ſee that the Elect be infallibly Recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Saved. Do I need to go over the other particulars? I know you ſee my meaning in them all: Specially that which I aim at is this: that as <hi>Paul</hi> had a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the life of all that were with him in the ſhip, and yet when ſome would have gone out, he told them <hi>Except theſe abide in the ſhip ye cannot be ſaved,</hi> Act. 27.31. (ſo that he makes their apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of danger in a Poſſibility of being drowned to be the means of detaining them in the ſhip till they came all ſafe to land) ſo Jeſus Chriſt who will infallibly ſave all his Elect (they being given him by his Father to be infallibly ſaved) will do it by cauſing them to hold faſt by him, through all the troubles and labours and temptations of this tumultuous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:57538:143"/>
world, and that till they came to land; and the apprehenſion of their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhall be his means to make them hold faſt: Yet is not their ſafety principally in themſelves, but in him: Nor is it their holding faſt by him that is the chief cauſe of their difference from thoſe that periſh: but that is his love and reſolution to ſave them. And therefore when they do let go their hold, he will not ſo loſe them; but will fetch them up again: Only he will not bring them through this ſea of danger, as you would draw a block through the water: but as men that muſt hold faſt, and be commanded and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to that end: and therefore when they loſe their hold, it is the fear of drowning, which they felt themſelves near, which ſhall cauſe them to hold faſter the next time: and this muſt needs be the fear of a poſſible danger. And for thoſe that periſh they have none to blame but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. They periſh not for want of a Saviour: but becauſe they would not lay hold on him, and follow him through the tempeſts and waves of trial: Nor can they quarrel with him, becauſe he did more for others, and did not as much for them, as long as he offered them ſo ſufficient help, that only their own wilfull refuſal
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:57538:144"/>
was their ruine, and their perdition was of themſelves.</p>
               <p>I conclude therefore, That ſeeing our Salvation is laid by God, upon our faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full obedient holding faſt to Chriſt through all trials and difficulties, and our holy fear is the means of that holding faſt (Chriſt being ſtill the principal cauſe of our ſafety) therefore never look for ſuch a Certainty of Salvation as ſhall put you above ſuch fears and moderated apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of danger: For then its ten to one you will loſe your hold. You read in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture very many warnings to take heed leaſt we fall, and threatnings to thoſe that do fall away and draw back. What are all theſe for, but to excite in us thoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate fears and cares and holy diligence which may prevent our falling away. And remember this, that there can be no ſuch holy fears and cares and diligence, where there is no danger or poſſibility of falling away; for there can be no Act without its proper Object: And the Object of fear is A poſſible hurt, at leaſt in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of him that feareth it. No man can fear that evil which he knoweth to be Impoſſible.</p>

raptures ſometimes themſelves; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they are gone, they think they are forſaken, and that all grace, or peace at leaſt is gone with them. Take heed of theſe expectations. And to ſatisfie you let me tell you theſe two or three things: 1. A ſetled calm and peace of ſoul is a great Mercy, and not to be undervalued and looked at as Nothing, 2. The higheſt raptures and paſſionate feeling joyes, are uſually of moſt doubtfull ſincerity. Not that I would have any ſuſpect the ſincerity of them without cauſe: but ſuch paſſions are not ſo certain ſignes of Grace, as the ſetled frame of the underſtanding and will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor can we ſo eaſily know that they are of the Spirit: and they are liable to more queſtioning, and have in them a greater Poſſibility of deceit. Doubtleſs it is very much that Phantaſie and Melancholy, and ſpecially a natural weakneſs and moveable temper will do in ſuch caſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mark whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not moſtly theſe three ſorts of people that have or pretend to have ſuch extraordinary raptures and feelings of joy. 1. Women and others that are moſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. Melancholy People. 3. Men that by erroneous opinions have loſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all their underſtandings in their phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies, and live like men in a continual
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:57538:145"/>
dream. Yet I doubt not but ſolid men have oft high joyes; and more we might all have if we did our duty: And I would have no Chriſtian content himſelf with a dull quietneſs of ſpirit, but by all means poſſible to be much in labouring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in God, and raiſing their ſouls to heavenly delights: O what lives do we loſe, which we might enjoy! But my meaning is this: Look at theſe joyes and delights as Duties and as Mercies, but look not at them as Marks of trial; ſo as to place more neceſſity in them then God hath done, or to think them to be ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary things. If you do but feel ſuch an high eſtimation of Chriſt and Heaven, that you would not leave him for all the world, take this for your ſureſt Signe. And if you have but ſo much Probability or Hope of your intereſt in him, that you can think of God as one that loveth you, and can be thankfull to Chriſt for Redeeming you, and are gladder in theſe hopes of your intereſt in Chriſt and Glory then if you were owner of all the world; take this for a happy Mercy and a high Conſolation. Yet I mean not that your joy in Chriſt will be alwaies ſo ſenſible, as for worldly things; but it will be more rational, ſolid, and deeper at the Heart. And that you
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:57538:146"/>
may know by this, You would not for all the Pleaſures, Honours or Profits in the world be in the ſame caſe as once you were (ſuppoſing that you were converted ſince you had the uſe of Reaſon and Memory) or at leaſt as you ſee the ungodly world ſtill lye in.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And let me adde this: Commonly thoſe that have the higheſt paſſionate joyes have the ſaddeſt lives: for they have with all the moſt paſſionate fears and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. Mark it whether you finde not this prove true. And it is partly from Gods will in his diſpenſations: partly from their own neceſſities, who after their exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do uſually need a prick in the fleſh, and a meſſenger of Satan to buffet them, leſt they be exalted above meaſure: and partly and moſt commonly it is from the temperature of their bodies. Weak paſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate women of moveable ſpirits and ſtrong affections, when they Love they Love violently, and when they Rejoyce, eſpecially in ſuch caſes, they have moſt ſenſible joyes, and when any fears ariſe, they have moſt terrible ſorrows. I know it is not ſo with all of that ſex; but mark the ſame people uſually that have the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Joyes, and ſee whether at other times they have not the greateſt troubles. This
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:57538:146"/>
week they are as at the gates of Heaven, and the next as at the doors of hell. I am ſure with many it is ſo. Yet it need not be ſo if Chriſtians would but look at theſe high joyes as Duties to be endeavoured and Mercies to be valued: But when they will needs Judge of their ſtate by them, and think that God is gone from them, or forſaken them, when they have not ſuch joyes, then it leaves them in terror and amazement. Like men after a flaſh of lightning that are left more ſenſible of the darkneſs. For no wiſe man can expect that ſuch Joyes ſhould be a Chriſtians or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſtate; or God ſhould ſo diet us with a continual feaſt. It would neither ſuit with our health, nor the condition of this Pilgrimage. Live therefore on your Peace of conſcience as your ordinary diet: when this is wanting, know that God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth you a faſt for your health: and when you have a feaſt of high Joyes, feed on it and be thankfull: but when they are taken from you, gape not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them as the Diſciples did after Chriſt at his Aſcenſion; but return thankfully to your ordinary diet of Peace: and remember that theſe Joyes which are now taken from you, may ſo return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: however there is a place prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

               </argument>
               <p>THis Direction is of as great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as any that I have yet given you: but I ſhall ſay but little of it becauſe I have ſpoke of it ſo fully already in my Book of <hi>Reſt,</hi> Part 3. Ch. 8, 9, 10, 11. My Reaſons for what I here aſſert are theſe: 1. Duty goeth in order of nature and time before comfort: as the Precept is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Promiſe: Comfort is part of the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:57538:147"/>
Reward, and therefore neceſſarily ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Duty. 2. Grace makes men both ſo ingenuous and Divine, as to conſider Gods due as well as their own; and what they ſhould Do, as well as what they ſhall Have: ſtill remembring that our works cannot Merit at Gods hands. 3. As we muſt have Grace before we can Know we have it, ſo ordinarily we muſt have a good meaſure of Grace before we can ſo clearly diſcern it as to be certain of it. Small things, I have told you are next to none, and hardly diſcernable by weak eyes. When all waies in the world are tried, it will be found, that there is no way ſo ſure for a doubting ſoul to be made certain of the truth of his Graces, as to keep them in Action, and get them increaſed. And it will be found that there is no one cauſe of Chriſtians doubting of the truth of their Faith, Love, Hope, Repentance, Humility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo great or ſo common as the ſmall degree of theſe Graces. Doth not the very language of complaining Chriſtians ſhew this? One ſaith, I have no faith: I cannot believe: I have no love to God: I have no delight in Duty: Another ſaith, I cannot mourn for ſin: my heart was never broken: I cannot patiently bear an injury: I have no cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:57538:148"/>
in oppoſing ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If all theſe were not in a low and weak degree, men could not ſo ordinarily think they had none. A lively, ſtrong, working Faith, Love, Zeal, Courage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as do the higheſt Towers, the greateſt mountains, the ſtrongeſt windes, the greateſt flames, which will force an obſervance by their greatneſs and effects. 4. Conſider alſo that it is more pleaſing to God to ſee his people ſtudy him and his will directly, then to ſpend the firſt and chiefeſt of their ſtudies about the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of comforts to themſelves. 5. And it is the nature of Grace to tend firſt and chiefly toward God: and but ſecondarily to be the evidence of our own happineſs. We have faith given us principally that we might believe, and live by it in daily applications of Chriſt: We have repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that it might break us off from ſin and bring us back to God: We have Love that we might Love God and our Redeemer, his Saints and Laws and waies: We have Zeal that we might be quickened in all our holy duties: and we have obedience to keep us in the way of our duty: The firſt thing we have to do with theſe Graces is to uſe them for thoſe holy ends which their nature doth
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:57538:148"/>
expreſs. And then the diſcerning of them that we may have Aſſurance followeth after this both in time and dignity. 6. And it is a matter of farre greater concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to our ſelves to ſeek after the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Chriſt and Grace, then after the certain knowledge that we have them. You may be ſaved though you never get Aſſurance here, but you cannot be ſaved without Chriſt and Grace. God hath not made Aſſurance the Condition of your ſalvation. It tends indeed exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to your comfort, and a pretious mercy it is; but your ſafety lieth not on it. It is better go ſorrowfull and doubting to Heaven, then comfortably to hell. Firſt therefore ask what is the Condition of ſalvation and the way to it, and then look that you do your beſt to perform it, and to go that way; and then try your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance in its ſeaſon. 7. Beſides, as it is a work of farre greater moment, ſo alſo of quicker diſpatch, to Believe and Love Chriſt truly, then to get Aſſurance that you do truly Believe and Love him. You may believe immediatly (by the help of Gods Grace:) but getting Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it, may be the work of a great part of your life. Let me therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat this one thing of you, that when
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57538:149"/>
you feel the want of any Grace, you would not preſently bend all your thoughts upon the enquiry Whether it be true or no; but rather ſay to your ſelf <hi>I ſee trying is a great and difficult, a long and tedious work: I may be this many years about it, and poſſibly be unreſolved ſtill. If I ſhould conclude that I have no Grace, I may be miſtaken: and ſo I may, if I think that I have it. I may inquire of friends and Miniſters long, and yet be left in doubt; It is therefore my ſureſt way to ſeek pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to obtain it, if I have it not, and to increaſe it if I have it: and I am certain none of that labour will be loſt: to get more is the way to know I have it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But perhaps you will ſay, How ſhould I get more Grace? that's a buſineſs of greater difficulty then ſo. I anſwer, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what I told you before, that as the beginning of Grace is in your Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſo the heart and life of it is in your Will: and the Affections and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate part are but the fruits and bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. If therefore your Grace be weak, it is chiefly in an <hi>unwillingneſs</hi> to yield to Chriſt and his Word and Spirit. Now how ſhould an unwilling ſoul be made <hi>willing?</hi> Why thus, 1. Pray conſtantly as you are able, for a willing minde, and
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:57538:149"/>
yielding inclinable heart to Chriſt. 2. Hear conſtantly thoſe Preachers that bend their doctrine to inform your underſtanding of the great neceſſity and excellency of Chriſt and Grace and Glory; and to perſwade the Will with the moſt forcible Arguments. A perſwading quickning Miniſtry that helps to excite your Graces and draw up your heart to Chriſt, is more uſefull then they that ſpend moſt of their time to perſwade you of your ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and give you comfort. 3. But ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially lay out your thoughts more in the moſt ſerious Conſiderations of thoſe things which tend to breed and feed thoſe particular Graces which you would have increaſed. Objects and moving Reaſons kept much upon the minde by ſerious thoughts, are the great engine appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both by nature and by Grace to turn about the ſoul of man. Thoughts are to your ſoul, as taking in the Air, and Meat and Drink to your body. Objects conſidered do turn the ſoul into their own Nature. Such as are the things that you moſt think and conſider of (I mean in purſuance of them) ſuch will you be your ſelf. Conſideration, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſerious Conſideration is Gods great Inſtrument to convert the ſoul and to
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:57538:150"/>
confirm it: to get grace and to keep it and increaſe it: If any ſoul periſh for want of Grace, it's ten to one it is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for want of frequent and ſerious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. That the moſt of us do lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh under ſuch weakneſſes, and attain to ſmall degrees of Grace, is for want of ſober, frequent conſideration. We know not how great things this would do, if it were but faithfully managed. This then is my advice, When you feel ſo great a want of faith and love (for thoſe be the main Graces for trial and uſe) that you doubt whether you have any or none, lay by thoſe doubting thoughts a while, and preſently go and ſet your ſelf to conſider of God's Truth, Goodneſs, Amiableneſs, and Kindheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs to miſerable unworthy ſinners: think what he is in himſelf, and what he is to you, and what he hath done for you, and what he will do for you if you do but conſent. And then think of the vanity of all the childiſh Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this world, how ſoon, and in how ſad a caſe they will leave us; and what ſilly contemptible things they are in compariſon of the everlaſting Glory of the Saints! By that time you have warmed your ſoul a little with ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:57538:150"/>
thoughts, you will finde your Faith and Love revive, and begin to ſtir and work within you: And then you will feel that you have Faith and Love! On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remember what I told you before, that the heart and ſoul of ſaving Faith and Love (ſuppoſing a Belief that the Goſpel is true) is all in this one Act of <hi>Willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> or <hi>Conſent</hi> to have Chriſt as he is offered. Therefore if you doubt of your Faith and Love, it is your own Willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that you doubt of; or elſe you know not what you do. Now methinks, if you took but a ſober view of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God and the Glory of Heaven on one ſide, and of the ſilly, empty, worthleſs world on the other ſide; and then ask your heart, Which it will chuſe? and ſay to your ſelf, <hi>O my ſoul, the God of Glory offers thee thy choice, of dung and vanity for a little time, or of the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable Joyes of Heaven for ever: Which wilt thou chooſe?</hi> I ſay, methinks the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of your own ſoul ſhould preſently reſolve you that you do Believe, and that you Love God above this preſent world! For if you can chooſe him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world, then you are more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of him then the world: and if he have more of your will, for certain he
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:57538:151"/>
hath more of your Faith and Love. Uſe therefore, in ſtead of doubting of your Faith, to Believe till you put it out of doubt: And if yet you doubt, ſtudy God and Chriſt and Glory yet better, and keep thoſe objects by Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cloſe to your heart, whoſe nature is to work the heart to Faith and Love. For certainly objects have a mighty power on the ſoul: and certainly God and Chriſt and Grace and Glory are Mighty Objects; as able to make a full and deep impreſſion on mans ſoul as any in the world: and if they work not, it is not through any imperfection in them, but becauſe they be not well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and by Conſideration held upon the heart that they may work. Perhaps you will ſay, that Meditation is too hard a work for you; and that your memory is ſo weak that you want matter to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate upon; or if you do meditate on theſe, yet you feel no great motion or alteration on your heart. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: If you want matter, take the help of ſome book that will afford you matter; and if you want life in Meditation, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe the moſt quickning writings you can get. If you have not better at hand, read over (and ſeriouſly conſider as you

read it) thoſe paſſages in the end of my Book of <hi>Reſt,</hi> which direct you in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of theſe graces, and give you ſome matter for your Meditation to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <p>Let me ask you now whether you have indeed taken this courſe in your doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? If not, how unwiſely have you done? Doubting is no cure: but actual Believing and Loving is a cure. If Faith and Love were things that you would fain get, but cannot, then you had cauſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to fear, and to lie down and riſe in trouble of minde from one year to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But its no ſuch matter: It is ſo far from being beyond your reach or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to have theſe Graces though you would, that they themſelves are nothing elſe but your very Willingneſs; at leaſt your Willingneſs to have Chriſt is both your Faith and Love. It may be ſaid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be in the power of your Will, which is nothing elſe but that Actual Willingneſs which you have already. If therefore you are unwilling to have him, what makes you complain for want of the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:57538:152"/>
ſenſe of his preſence, and the Aſſurance of his Love, and the Graces of his Spirit, as you frequently do? It's ſtrange to me, that people ſhould make ſo many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to God and men, and ſpend ſo many ſad hours in fears and trouble, and all for want of that which they would not have: If you be not Willing be Willing now: If you ſay you cannot; do as I have before directed you: One hours ſober, ſerious thoughts of God and the world, of Chriſt and Satan, of ſin and Holineſs, of Heaven and hell, and the differences of them, will do very much to make you Willing. Yet miſtake me not: Though I ſay you may have Chriſt if you Will, and Faith and Love if you Will, and no man can truly ſay, I would be glad to have Chriſt (as he is offered) but Cannot; Yet this Gladneſs, Conſent or Willingneſs which I mention, is the effect of the ſpecial work of the Spirit, and was not in your power before you had it: nor is it yet ſo in your power as to Believe without Gods further help: but he that hath made you willing, will not be wanting to maintain your willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Though I will ſay to any man, You may have Chriſt if you Will: yet I will ſay to no man, You can be willing of your
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:57538:152"/>
ſelf, or without the ſpecial Grace of God.</p>
               <p>Nay let me further ask: Have not you darkned, buried or weakned your Graces, in ſtead of exerciſing and increaſing them, even then when you complained for want of Aſſurance of them? when you found a want of Faith and Love, have not you weakened them more, and ſo made them leſs diſcernable? Have you not fed your unbelief, and diſputed for your doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and taken Satans part againſt your ſelf; and (which is farre worſe) have you never through theſe doubtings enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained hard thoughts of God, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him to your ſoul as unwilling to ſhew you mercy, and in an unlovely, dreadfull, hideous ſhape, fitter to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright you from him then to draw you to him, and likelier to provoke your hatred then your love? If you have not done thus, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> know too many troubled ſouls that have: And if you have, you have taken a very unlikely way to get Aſſurance. If you would have been certain that you Loved God in ſincerity, you ſhould have labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Love him more, till you had been certain: And that you might do ſo, you ſhould have kept better thoughts of God in your minde. You will hardly love him while you think of him as evil, or at leaſt
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:57538:153"/>
as hurtfull to you. Never forget this Rule which I laid you down in the beginning, that <hi>He that will ever love God, muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him to be Good: and the more large and deep are our apprehenſions of his goodneſs, the more will be our Love: For ſuch as God appears to be to mens fixed conceivings, ſuch will their Affections be to him. For the fixed, deep conceptions or apprehenſions of the mind, do lead about the ſoul, and guide the life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I conclude therefore with this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and importunate requeſt to you, That <hi>though it be a duty neceſſary in its time and place, to examine our ſelves concerning our ſincerity, in our ſeveral graces and duties to God; yet be ſure that the firſt and farre greater part of your time, and pains and care and inquiries, be for the getting and increaſing of your grace, then for the diſcerning it; and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form your duty rightly, then to diſcern your right performance.</hi> And when you conferre with Miniſters or others that may teach you, ſee that you ask ten times at leaſt, <hi>How ſhould I get or increaſe my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I ſhould next have ſpoke of the ſecond part of the Direction, <hi>How much our Aſſurance and Comfort, will ſtill depend on our Actual obedience.</hi> But this will fall in in handling the two or three next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Directions.</p>
            </div>

               <head>DIRECTION XXIII.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p n="23">23. <hi>My next advice is this,</hi> Think not that thoſe doubts and troubles of minde, which are cauſed and continued by wilfull Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, will ever be well healed but by the healing of that Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: or that the ſame means muſt be uſed and will ſuffice to the cure of ſuch troubles; which muſt be uſed and will ſuffice to cure the troubles of a tender-conſcience, and of an obedient Chriſtian, whoſe trouble is meerly through miſtakes of their condition.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Will begin with the later part of this Direction. He that is troubled upon meer miſtakes may be quieted upon the removal of them. If he underſtood not the univerſal extent of Chriſts ſatisfaction, or of the Covenant or conditional Grant of Chriſt and Life in him: and if upon
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:57538:154"/>
this he be troubled, as thinking that he is not included; the convincing him of his error may ſuffice to the removal of his trouble. If he be troubled through his miſtaking the nature of true Faith, or true Love, or other Graces, and ſo think that he hath them not when he hath them; the diſcovery of his error may be the quieting of his ſoul. The ſoul that is troubled upon ſuch miſtakes muſt be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly dealt with: Much more they that are diſquieted by groundleſs fears, or too deep apprehenſions of the wrath or juſtice of God, of the evil of ſin, and of their <hi>unworthineſs,</hi> and for want of fuller apprehenſions of the loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, and the tender compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate nature of Chriſt. We can ſcarce handle ſuch ſouls too gently. God would have all to be tenderly dealt with, that are tender of diſpleaſing and diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him by ſin. Gods own language may teach all Miniſters what language we ſhould uſe to ſuch, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. <hi>Thus ſaith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity, whoſe Name is Holy; I dwel in the high and holy place; with him alſo that is of a contrite and humble ſpirit, to revive the ſpirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. For
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:57538:155"/>
I will not contend for ever, neither will I be alwaies wroth: For the ſpirit ſhould fail before me, and the ſouls which I have made,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But the wicked are like the troubled ſea when it cannot reſt, whoſe waters caſt up mire and dirt: There is no peace ſaith my God to the wicked.</hi> Much more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der language may ſuch expect from Chriſt in the Goſpel, where is contained a fuller revelation of his Grace. If <hi>Mary</hi> a poor ſinfull woman lie weeping at his feet, and waſhing them with her tears, he hath not the heart to ſpurn her away; but openly proclaims the forgiveneſs of her many ſinnes.
As ſoon as ever the heart of a ſinner is turned from his ſinnes, the heart of Chriſt is turned to him. The very ſumme of all the Goſpel is contained in thoſe precious words, which fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs this, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28, 29, 30. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you Reſt. Take my yoak upon you and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye ſhall finde Reſt unto your ſouls: For my yoak is eaſie and my burden is light.</hi> When the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.20. doth once come home to his Father, with ſorrow and ſhame con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:57538:155"/>
him, and ſees him afarre off, and ſtaies not his coming but runs and meets him: and when he comes to him he doth not upbraid him with his ſins, nor ſay, <hi>Thou Rebell, why haſt thou forſaken me, and preferred harlots and luxury before me?</hi> nay he doth not ſo much as frown upon him: but compaſſionatly fals on his neck and kiſſeth him: Alas, God knows that a poor ſinner in this humbled troubled caſe, hath burden enough on his back already, and indeed more then he is able of himſelf to bear. The ſenſe of his own ſinfull folly and miſery is burden enough: If God ſhould adde to this his frowns and terrors, and ſhould ſpurn at a poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that lies proſtrate at his feet, in tears or terrours, who then ſhould be able to ſtand before him, or to look him in the face? But he will not break the bruiſed reed; he will not make heavier the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of a ſinner. He cals them to come to him for Eaſe and Reſt, and not to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them or kill them with his terrours. We have not a King like <hi>Rehoboam</hi> that will multiply our preſſures; but one whoſe office it is to break our yoaks, and looſe our bonds and ſet us free. When he was a Preacher himſelf on earth, you may gather what Doctrine he preached by his
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:57538:156"/>
Text, which he choſe at one of his firſt publike Sermons; which as you may finde in <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18, 19. was this, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me; becauſe he hath anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me to preach the Gospel to the poor; he hath ſent me to heal the broken hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of ſight to the blinde, to ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty them that are bruiſed; to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.</hi> O if a poor bruiſed, wounded ſoul had but heard this Sermon from his Saviours own mouth; what heart-meltings would it have cauſed? what pangs of Love would it have raiſed in him! You would ſure have believed then that the Lord is gracious, when <hi>All</hi> (that heard him) <hi>bare him witneſs, and wondred at the gracious words that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded out of his mouth,</hi> Luke 4.22. I would deſire no more for the comfort of ſuch a ſoul then to ſee ſuch a ſight, and feel ſuch a feeling as the poor penitent Prodigal did, when he found himſelf in the arms of his Father, and felt the kiſſes of his mouth, and was ſurprized ſo unexpectedly with ſuch a torrent of Love. The ſoul that hath once ſeen and felt this, would never ſure have ſuch hard and doubtfull thoughts of God, except through ignorance they knew not whoſe arms they were that thus
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:57538:156"/>
embraced them, or whoſe voice it was that thus beſpoke them; or unleſs the remembrance of it were gone out of their mindes. You ſee then what is Gods own language to humbled Penitents, and what is the method of his dealings with them: And ſuch muſt be the language and deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Miniſters: They muſt not wound when Chriſt would heal; nor make ſad the heart that Chriſt would comfort, and would not have made ſad, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.22.</p>
               <p>But will this means ſerve turn, or muſt the ſame courſe be taken, to remove the ſorrows of the wilfully diſobedient? No, God takes another courſe himſelf, and preſcribes another courſe to his Miniſters, and requires another courſe from the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner himſelf. But ſtill remember who it is that I ſpeak of: It is not the ordinary unavoidable infirmities of the Saints that I ſpeak of; ſuch as they cannot be rid of, though they fain would; ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.19. <hi>The good that I would do I do not:</hi> and <hi>when I would do good evil is preſent with me:</hi> And <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that we cannot do the things that we would. A true Chriſtian would Love God more perfectly, and Delight in him
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:57538:157"/>
more abundantly, and bring every thought in ſubjection to his Will, and ſubdue the very remnants of carnal concupiſcence, that there ſhould be no ſtirrings of luſt or unjuſt anger, or worldly deſires, or pride within him; and that no vain word might paſs his lips: all this he would do but he cannot. Striving againſt theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable infirmities is conquering.</p>
               <p>But though we cannot keep under eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry motion of concupiſcence, we can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the execution. Anger will ſtirre up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on provocations; But we may reſtrain it in degree, that it ſet us not in a flame, and do not much diſtemper or diſcompoſe our mindes: and we can forbid our tongues all raging, furious or abuſive words in our Anger; all curſing, ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or reproachfull ſpeaking. If an envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thought againſt our Brother do ariſe in our hearts, becauſe he is prefer'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we may hate it and repreſs it, and chide our hearts for it, and command our tongues to ſpeak well of him, and no evil. Some pride and ſelf-eſteem will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main and be ſtirring in us, do what we can, it is a ſinne ſo deeply rooted in our corrupt Natures: But yet we can deteſt it, and reſiſt it, and meet with abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence our ſelf-conceited thoughts, and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:57538:157"/>
rejoycings in our own reputations and fame, and inward heart-riſings againſt thoſe that undervalue us and ſtand in the way of our Repute; and we may forbear our boaſting language, and our conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings for our credit, and our excuſes of our ſinnes, and our backbitings and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret defaming of thoſe that croſs us in the way of credit: We may forbear our quarrels and eſtrangements and dividings from our Brethren, and ſtiff inſiſting on our own conceits, and expecting that others ſhould make our Judgements their Rule, and ſay and do as we would have them, and all dance after our pipe; all which are the effects of inward Pride<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We cannot, while we are on earth, be free from all inordinate Love of the world, and the Riches and Honours of it; but we may ſo watch againſt it and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it, as that it ſhall neither be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before God, nor draw us to unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full waies of gain, by lying, deceit and overreaching our Brethren; by ſtealing, unjuſt or unmercifull dealings, oppreſſing the poor, and inſulting over thoſe that are in the way of our thriving, and cruſhing them that would hinder our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring deſignes, and treading them down that will not bow to us, and taking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:57538:158"/>
of them that have croſſed or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraged us, or cruelly exacting all our Rights and Debts of the poor; and ſquee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing the purſes of ſubjects or tenants, or thoſe that we bargain with, like a ſpunge, as long as any thing will come out: Yea we may ſo farre ſubdue our love of the world, as that it ſhall not hinder us from being mercifull to the poor, compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to our ſervants and labourers, and bountifull to our power in doing good works: nor yet ſhut out Gods ſervice from our families or cloſets, nor rob him of our frequent, affectionate thoughts, eſpecially on the Lords day. So for ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality or the pleaſing of our fleſh more immediatly; we ſhall never on earth be wholly freed from inordinate motions, and temptations, and fleſhly deſires, and urgent inclinations and ſolicitations to forbidden things. But yet we may reſtrain our Appetite by reaſon, ſo farre that it bring us not to gluttony and drunkenneſs, and a ſtudying for our bellies, and pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering of our fleſh, or a taking care for it, and making proviſion to ſatisfie its luſts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14. We may forbear the obeying it, in exceſs of Apparel, in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent, ſcandalous or time-waſting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, in uncleanneſs or unchaſt
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:57538:158"/>
ſpeeches or behaviour, or the reading of amorous Books and Sonnets, or feeding our eyes or thoughts on filthy or enticing objects, or otherwaies wilfully blowing the fire of luſt: So alſo for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of Duty: We ſhall never in this life be able to Hear or Read ſo diligently, and underſtandingly or affectionately as we would do: nor to remember or profit by what we hear, as we deſire. But yet we can bring our ſelves to the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not preferre our eaſe or buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or any vain thing before Gods Word and Worſhip, or loath or deſpiſe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſome weakneſs in the ſpeaker: And we may in a great meaſure reſtrain our thoughts from wandring, and force our ſelves to attend; and labour when we come home to recall it to minde. We cannot call on God ſo fervently, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly or delightfully as we would: But yet we may do it ſincerely as we can, and do it conſtantly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We cannot inſtruct our children and ſervants, and reprove or exhort our neighbours, with that bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or love and compaſſion and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and meet expreſſions, as we would: But yet we may do it faithfully and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently as we are able.</p>
               <p>So that you may ſee in all this what
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:57538:159"/>
ſin it is that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. when he ſaith, When he would do good, evil is preſent with him; and that he is lead captive to the Law of ſin, and ſerves the Law of ſin with his fleſh: and <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.17. when he ſaith, <hi>We cannot do the things that we would</hi>; he ſpeaks not of wilfull ſinning, or groſs ſin, but of unavoidable infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; whereby alſo we are too often drawn into a committing of many ſinnes which we might avoid (for ſo the beſt doe.)</p>
               <p>And becauſe you may often reade and hear of ſinnes of Infirmity, as diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from other ſinnes, let me here give you notice, that this word may be taken in ſeveral ſenſes, and that there are three ſeveral ſorts of ſinnes of Infirmity in the Godly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There are thoſe ſinnes which a man cannot avoid though he would: which are in the gentleſt ſenſe called <hi>Sins of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity.</hi> Here note 1. That <hi>Adam</hi> had none ſuch. 2. And that the reaſon of them is becauſe 1. Our Reaſon which ſhould direct, and our Wils themſelves which ſhould command, are both Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. 2. And our Faculties that ſhould be commanded and directed are by ſin grown impotent and obſtinate, and have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:57538:159"/>
a rebelling diſobedient diſpoſition. 3. And that degree of Grace, which the beſt attain to in this life, is not ſuch as wholly to overcome either the imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the guiding and commanding fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, or the rebellion of the obeying fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. Otherwiſe if our own Wils were perfect, and the rebellion of the inferiour faculties cured, no man could then ſay, <hi>The good that I would I do not, and the evil that I would not that I do.</hi> For the Will would ſo fully command, that all would obey, and it ſelf being perfect, all would be perfect. And therefore in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it is and will be ſo.</p>
               <p>I know Philoſophers conclude that all acts of the inferiour Faculties are but acts commanded by the Will: It ſhould be ſo I confeſs: It is the office of the Will to command, and the underſtanding to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, and the reſt to obey. But in our ſtate of ſinfull imperfection the ſoul is ſo diſtempered and corrupted, that the Will cannot fully rule thoſe Faculties that it ſhould rule; ſo that it may be ſaid, <hi>I would forbear ſin but cannot.</hi> For 1. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is become a dark, imperfect Directer. 2. The Will is become an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Receiver of the Underſtandings Directions; yea an oppoſer, as being
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:57538:160"/>
tainted with the neighbourhood of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered ſenſe. 3. When the Will is rectified by Grace, it is but in part; and therefore when <hi>Paul</hi> or any holy man ſaith, <hi>I would do good,</hi> and <hi>I would not do evil,</hi> they mean it not of a perfect wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs, but of a ſincere; to wit, that this is the main bent of their Will, and the reſolved prevalent act of it, is for good. 4. When the Will doth command, yet the commanded Faculties do refuſe to obey, through an unfitneſs, of impotency and corruption. 1. The Will hath but an imperfect command of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (I mean as to the exerciſe of the act, in which reſpect it commandeth it, and not as to the ſpecification of the act.) A man may truly and ſtrongly deſire to Know more, and apprehend things more clearly, and yet cannot. 2. The Will hath but an imperfect command of the Phantaſie or Thoughts; ſo that a man may truly ſay, <hi>I would think more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, more intentively, and more orderly of good, and leſs of vanity; and yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.</hi> For objects and paſſions may force the Phantaſie and Cogitations in ſome degree. 3. The Will hath but an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect command of the paſſions: ſo that a man may truly ſay, <hi>I would not be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:57538:160"/>
or afraid, or grieved, or diſquieted, or angry; but I cannot chooſe,</hi> and <hi>I would mourn more for ſinne, and be more afraid of ſinning and of Gods displeaſure, and more zealous for God, and more delighted in him, and joy more in holy things, but I cannot.</hi> For theſe paſſions lie ſo open to the aſſault of objects (having the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for their inlet, and the moveable ſpirits for their ſeat or inſtruments) that even when the Will commands them one way, an object may force them in part againſt the Wils command, as we finde ſenſibly in caſes of fear, and ſorrow or anger, which we can force a man to whether he will or no. And if there be no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting object, yet cannot the Will excite theſe paſſions to what height it ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. For their motion depends as much (and more) on the lively manner of repreſenting the Object, and the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature and weight of the object re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, and upon the heat and nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the ſpirits, and temperature of the body, as upon the command of the Will. 4. Much leſs can the Will command out all vicious habits and ſenſual or corrupt inclinations: and therefore a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may well ſay in reſpect of theſe, that he would be more holy, heavenly and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:57538:161"/>
diſpoſed to good, and leſs to evil, but he cannot. 5. As for complacency and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency, liking or diſliking, love and hatred, ſo farre as they are paſſions, I have ſpoke of them before: but ſo farre as they are the immediate acts of the Will (Willing and Nilling) they are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſaid to be commanded by it, but elicit, or acted by it: (wherein how farre it hath power is a moſt noble Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; but unfit for this place or your capacity.) And thus you ſee that there are many Acts of the Soul, beſide Habits, which the Will cannot now perfectly command, and ſo a Chriſtian cannot be what he would be, nor do the things that he would: And theſe are the firſt ſort of ſins of Infirmity.</p>
               <p>If you ſay, <hi>Sure theſe can be no ſinnes becauſe we are not willing of them, and there is no more ſin then there is will in it.</hi> I anſwer, 1. We were in <hi>Adam</hi> willing of that ſin which cauſed them. 2. We are in ſome degree inclining in our Wils to ſin, though God have that prevalent part and determination, which in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative caſes doth denominate them. 3. The Underſtanding and Will may be moſt hainouſly guilty where they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, in that they do not more ſtrongly

diſſent, and more potently and rulingly command all the ſubject Faculties. And ſo a Negation of the Wils act, or of ſuch a Degree of it, as is neceſſary to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of the ſenſual part, is a deep guilt, and great offence, and it may be ſaid, that there is Will in this ſin. It is morally or reputatively voluntary, though not naturally: becauſe the Will doth not its office when it ſhould: As a man is guilty of voluntary murder of his own childe, that ſtands by and ſeeth his ſervant kill him, and doth not do his beſt to hinder him. I would this were better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by ſome Divines: For I think that the commoneſt guilt of the Reaſon and Will in our actual ſinnes, is by Omiſſion of the exerciſe of their Authority to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it: And that moſt ſinnes are more bruitiſh, as to the true efficient cauſe, then many imagine; and yet they are humane or moral Acts too, and the ſoul never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs guilty; becauſe the commanded Faculties performed not their office, and ſo are the Moral or Imputative cauſes, and ſo the great culpable cauſes of the fact. (But I am drawn nearer to Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy and points beyond your reach then I intended: a fault that I muſt be ſtill reſiſting in all my Writings, being
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:57538:162"/>

               <p>The ſecond kinde of ſinnes of Infirmity are, <hi>The ſmaller ſort of ſinnes which we may forbear if we will</hi>; that is, <hi>If we be actually, though not perfectly, yet preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently Willing; or if our Wils be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to forbear them: or if the chief part of the Will actually be for ſuch forbearance.</hi> The firſt ſort are called ſinnes of Infirmity in an Abſolute ſenſe. Theſe laſt I call ſinnes of Infirmity in both an Abſolute and Comparative ſenſe: that is, both as they proceed from our inward corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which through the weakneſs of the ſoul having but little grace, is not fully reſtrained, and alſo as it is compared with groſs ſinnes: And ſo we may call idle words, and raſh expreſſions in our haſt, and ſuch like, <hi>Sins of Infirmity,</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of Murder, Perjury, or the like groſs, ſinnes; which we commonly call <hi>Crimes,</hi> or <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> when the former we uſe to call but <hi>Faults.</hi> Theſe Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities are they which the Papiſts (and ſome Learned Divines of our own; as <hi>Rob. Baronius</hi> in his excellent Tractate
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:57538:162"/>
                  <hi>de Peccat. Mortali &amp; Veniali)</hi> do call <hi>Venial ſinnes:</hi> Some of them in a fair and honeſt ſenſe, <hi>viz. Becauſe they are ſuch ſinnes as a true Chriſtian may live and die in, though not unrepented or unreſiſted, yet not ſubdued ſo farre as to forſake or ceaſe from the practice of them; and yet they are pardoned.</hi> But other Papiſts call them <hi>Venial</hi> ſinnes in a wicked ſenſe, as if they needed no pardon, or deſerved not eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal puniſhment. (And why ſhould they call them <hi>Venial</hi> if they need not pardon?) A juſtified man liveth in the daily practice of ſome vain thoughts, or the frequent commiſſion of ſome other ſinnes, which by his utmoſt diligence he might reſtrain: But he liveth not in the frequent pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Adultery, Drunkenneſs, Falſe-witneſſing, Slandering, Hating his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet obſerve that though the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned leſſer ſinnes are called <hi>Infirmities,</hi> in regard of the matter of them; yet they may be ſo committed in regard of the end and manner of them, as may make them crimes or groſs ſinnes: As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, If one ſhould uſe idle words wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, reſolvedly, without reſtraint, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy or tenderneſs of conſcience, this were groſs ſinning: or the neerer it
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:57538:163"/>
comes to this, and the more wilfulneſs or neglect or evil ends there is in the ſmalleſt forbidden action, the worſe it is, and the groſſer. And obſerve (of which more anon) that the true bounds or difference between groſs ſinnes, and thoſe leſſer faults, which we call Infirmities, cannot be given; (I think, by any man; I am ſure not by me) either as to the Act it ſelf, to ſay, juſt what Acts are groſs ſins and what not; or elſe, as to the manner of committing them; as to ſay, Juſt how much of the Will muſt go to make a groſs ſinne; or Juſt how farre a man may proceed in the degree of evil intents; or how farre in the frequency of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, before it muſt be called a groſs ſinne.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third ſort of ſinnes which may be called <hi>Sins of Infirmity,</hi> are theſe laſt mentioned groſs ſinnes themſelves, ſo far as they are found in the Regenerate: Theſe are groſs ſinnes put in oppoſition to the former ſort of Infirmities; but our Divines uſe to call them all <hi>Sins of Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> in oppoſition to the ſinnes of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, who are utterly unholy. And they call them <hi>Sins of Infirmity</hi> 1. Becauſe the perſon that committeth them is not dead in ſinnes, as the Unregenerate are,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:57538:163"/>
but only diſeaſed, wounded and infirm. 2. Becauſe that they are not committed with ſo full conſent of Will, as thoſe of the Unregenerate are; but only after much ſtriving, or at leaſt contrary to Habitual Reſolutions, though not againſt Actual.</p>
               <p>Here we are in very great Difficulties, and full of Controverſies: Some ſay, that theſe groſs ſinnes do extinguiſh true Grace, and are inconſiſtent with it: and that <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> were out of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of Grace till they did again Repent: Others ſay, that they were in the ſtate of Grace and not at al ſo liable to condemnation, but that if they had died in the Act, they had been ſaved: becauſe <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the ſins of Believers are alike ſins of Infirmity, pardoned on the ſame terms: and therefore as a raſh word may be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without a particular repentance, ſo poſſibly may theſe groſs ſins. To others this ſeems dangerous and contrary to Scripture, and therefore they would fain finde out a way between both: But how to do it clearly and ſatisfactorily is not eaſie (at leaſt, to me, who have been long upon it, but am yet much in the dark in it.) I think it is plain that ſuch perſons are not totally unſanctified by
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:57538:164"/>
their ſin: I believe that Chriſts intereſt is Habitually more in their Wils, then is the intereſt of the fleſh or world, at that very time when they are ſinning, and ſo Chriſts intereſt is leaſt as to their Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Willing: And ſo ſinne prevaileth for that time againſt the Act of their Faith and Love, but not wholly againſt the prevalent part of the Habit. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the ſhaking winde of that ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my temptation is over, the ſoul will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Chriſt by Repentance, Love, and renewed Obedience. But then to know what ſtate he is Relatively in this while, as to his Juſtification and Reconciliation and right to Glory, is the point of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding difficulty. Whether as we diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of Habitual Faith and Love and Obedience, which he hath not loſt; and Actual, which he hath loſt; ſo we muſt make ſome anſwerable diſtinction of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification (Habitual and Actual it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be) into Virtual Juſtification, which he hath not loſt, and Actual Juſtification which he hath loſt? or into Plenary Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification (which he hath not) and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Juſtification, wanting a further Act to make it Plenary (which may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.) But ſtill, it will be more difficult to ſhew punctually what this Imperfect
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:57538:164"/>
or Virtual Juſtification is? and moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to ſhew, Whether with the loſs of Actual Plenary Juſtification, and the loſs of a Plenary Right to Heaven, a mans ſalvation may conſiſt; that is, Whether if he ſhould die in that condition, he ſhould be ſaved or condemned? Or if it be ſaid, that <hi>he ſhall certainly repent,</hi> 1. Yet ſuch a ſuppoſition may be put, while he yet repenteth not; for the enquiry into his ſtate; How farre there is any interci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Juſtification, Pardon, Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Right to ſalvation? 2. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it can fully be proved that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible (or that which never was or ſhall be) for a Regenerate man to die in the very act of a groſs ſinne (as ſelf-murder or the like?) For my part I think God hath purpoſely left us here in the dark, that we may not be too bold in ſinning, but may know that whether the groſs ſins of Believers be ſuch as deſtroy their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and right to Glory, preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, or not, yet certainly they leave them in the dark, as to any Certainty of their Juſtification or Salvation.</p>
               <p>And then more dark is it and impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſcover, How farre a man may go in theſe groſſer ſinnes; and yet have the prevalent habits of Grace? As to the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:57538:165"/>
former Queſtion about the interciſion of Juſtification, I am ſomewhat inclinable to think, that the habit of Faith hath more to do in our Juſtification then I have formerly thought, and may as properly be ſaid to be the condition as the act: and that as long as a man is (in a prevalent degree) habitually a Believer, he is not only imperfectly and virtually Juſtified, but ſo farre actually Juſtified, that he ſhould be ſaved, though he were cut off before he actually Repent: And that he being already habitually Penitent, having a hatred of all ſin as ſin, ſhould be ſaved, if meer want of opportunity do prevent the Act: And that only thoſe ſinnes do bring a man into a ſtate of condemnation, or prove him in ſuch, which conſiſt not with the <hi>Habitual Preheminence</hi> of Chriſts intereſt in our ſouls above the intereſt of the fleſh and world; And that <hi>David</hi>'s and <hi>Peter</hi>'s were ſuch as did conſiſt with the preheminence of Chriſts intereſt in the habit. But withall, that ſuch groſs ſinnes muſt needs be obſervable, and ſo the ſoul that is guilty doth ordinarily know its guilt, yea and think of it: And that it is inconſiſtent with this habitual Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, not to Repent actually as ſoon as Time is afforded, and the violence of
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:57538:165"/>
paſſion ſo farre allaied, as that the ſoul may recollect it ſelf, and Reaſon have its free uſe: And that he that hath this lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and opportunity for the free uſe of Reaſon, and yet doth not Repent, it is a ſign that the intereſt of the fleſh is habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually as well as actually ſtronger then Chriſts intereſt in him. I ſay, in this doubtfull caſe, I am moſt inclining to judge thus: But as I would have no man take this as my reſolved Judgement, much leſs as certain Truth, and leaſt of all, to venture on ſinne or impenitency ever the more for ſuch a doubtfull opinion, which doth not conclude him to be certainly unjuſtified; ſo I am utterly ignorant both how long ſenſual paſſions may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly rage and keep the ſoul from ſober Conſideration; or how farre they may interpoſe in the very time of Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and fruſtrate it, and prevail againſt it: and ſo keep the ſinner from actual Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or at leaſt, from a full ingenuous acknowledgement and bewailing of the ſin which is neceſſary to full Repentance: and how long Repentance may be ſo farre ſtifled, as to remain only in ſome inward grudgings of conſcience, and trouble of minde, hindered from breaking out into free Confeſſion (which ſeemeth to have
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:57538:166"/>
been <hi>David</hi>'s caſe long.) Nay it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to know juſt how long a man may live in the very practice of ſuch groſs ſin, before Chriſts habitual Intereſt above the fleſh be either overthrown, or proved not to be there? and how oft a man that hath true Grace may commit ſuch ſins: Theſe things are undiſcernable; beſides that none can punctually define a groſs ſin ſo as to exclude every degree of Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and include every degree of ſuch groſs ſin.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you will marvell why I run ſo farre in this Point; It is both to give you as much light as I can, what ſins they be which be to be called Infirmities, and ſo what ſins they be that do forbid that gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, comforting way of cure, when the ſoul is troubled for them, which muſt be uſed with thoſe that are troubled more then needs, or upon miſtakes: and alſo to convince you of this weighty Truth, That <hi>Our Comfort yea and Aſſurance hath a great dependance on our actual obedience: yea ſo great that the leaſt obedient ſort of ſincere Chriſtians cannot by ordinary means have any Aſſurance: and the moſt obedient (if other neceſſaries concurre) will have th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> moſt Aſſurance: and for the middle ſort; their Aſſurance will riſe and fall, ordinarily
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:57538:166"/>
with their obedience: ſo that there's no way to comfort ſuch offending Chriſtians but by reducing them to fuller obedience by Faith and Repentance, that ſo the evidences of their Juſtification may be clear, and the great impediments of their Aſſurance and Comfort be removed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I will yet make clearer to you by its Reaſons, and then tell you how to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it to your ſelf.</p>
               <p n="1">1. No man can be ſure of his ſalvation or Juſtification but he that is ſure of his true Faith and Love. And no man can be ſure of his true Faith and Love, but he that is ſure of the ſincerity of his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: For true Faith doth ever take God for our great Soveraign, and Chriſt for our Lord-Redeemer, and containeth a Covenant-delivery of a mans ſelf to God and the Redeemer to be Ruled by him, as a Subject, Childe, Servant and Spouſe. This is not done ſincerely and ſavingly unleſs there be an actual and habitual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to obey God and the Redeemer, before all creatures, and againſt all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations that would draw us from him To obey Chriſt a little, and the fleſh more, is no true obedience: If the fleſh can do more with us to draw us to ſin, then Faith and Obedience do, to keep us from ſin,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:57538:167"/>
ordinarily; this is no true Faith or Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. If Chriſt have not the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the ſoul, and his Intereſt be not the moſt predominant and potent, we are no true Believers. Now it is plain, that the Intereſt of the world and fleſh doth actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally prevail, when a man is actually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting a known ſinne, and omitting a known duty: and then it is certain that Habits are known but by the Acts. And therefore it muſt needs be that the ſoul that moſt ſinneth muſt needs be moſt in doubt whether the Intereſt of Chriſt or the fleſh be predominant? and ſo whether his obedience be true or no? and ſo whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he did ſincerely take Chriſt for his Soveraign? and that is, whether he be a true Believer? For when a man is enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into the ſtate of his ſoul, Whether he do ſubject himſelf to Chriſt as his only Soveraign? and whether the Authority and Love of Chriſt will do more with him, then the temptations of the world, fleſh and devil? he hath no way to be reſolved but by feeling the Pulſe of his own Will? And if he ſay, <hi>I am willing to obey Chriſt before the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ſh,</hi> and yet do actually live in an obedience to the fleſh before Chriſt, he is deceived in his own Will: for this is no ſaving Willingneſs. A wicked man
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:57538:167"/>
may have ſome will to obey Chriſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally: but having more will to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>viz.</hi> to pleaſe the fleſh before Chriſt, therefore he is wicked ſtill: ſo that you ſee in our ſelf-examination, the buſineſs is for the moſt part finally Reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into our ſincere actual obedience. For thus we proceed: We firſt finde, <hi>He that believeth and loveth Chriſt ſincerely, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Then we proceed, <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth ſincerely taketh Chriſt for his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.</hi> Then, <hi>He that truly taketh Chriſt for his Soveraign, doth truly reſolve to obey him and his Laws, before the world, fleſh or devil.</hi> Then, <hi>He that truly reſolveth thus to obey Chriſt before all, doth ſincerely perform his reſolution, and doth ſo obey him.</hi> For that is no true reſolution ordinarily, that never comes to performance. And here we are caſt unavoidably to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we do perform our reſolutions by actual obedience? before we can ſit down with ſetled Peace: much more before we get Aſſurance. Now thoſe that are dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and carefull in obeying, and have greateſt conqueſt over their corruptions, and do moſt ſeldom yield to temptations, but do moſt notably and frequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer them, theſe have the cleareſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the performance of their reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:57538:168"/>
by obedience; and conſequently the fulleſt Aſſurance: But they that are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt overcome by temptations, and yield moſt to ſin, and live moſt diſobediently, muſt needs be furtheſt from Aſſurance of the ſincerity of their obedience, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of their ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God himſelf hath plainly made our actual obedience, not only a ſign of true Faith, but a ſecondary part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our ſalvation as promiſed in the New Covenant. And therefore it is as impoſſible to be ſaved without it, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith: ſuppoſing that the perſon have opportunity to obey, in which caſe only it is made neceſſary as a condition. This I will but cite ſeveral Scriptures to prove, and leave you to peruſe them if you be unſatisfied. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1, to 14. They that are in Chriſt Jeſus, are they that walk, not after the fleſh but after the Spirit. <hi>If ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall die, but if ye by the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live.</hi> Rev. 22.14. <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of Life, and may enter in by the Gate into the City.</hi> Heb. 5.9. <hi>He is become the Author of eternal ſalvation to all them that obey him.</hi> Matth. 11.28, 29, 30. <hi>Take my yoak upon you, for it is
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:57538:168"/>
eaſie, and my burden for it is light. Learn of me</hi> to be <hi>meek and lowly,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ye ſhall finde Reſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 16.27. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.24. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7, 10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.12, 17. &amp; 14.21. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.27, 35. <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.17, 21. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.37. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.18, 19. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5, 12. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41, 42. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.21, 22, 23, 24, 26. &amp; 1.12. &amp; 2.5. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.23. &amp; 28.13. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.3, 5. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.37. &amp; 11.25, 26. &amp; 6.12, 14, 15. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.9. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.22. &amp; 3.19. &amp; 22.16. <hi>Luke</hi> 6.37. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.18. &amp; 1.2, 22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.16. with abundance more the like. Now when a poor ſinner that hath oft fallen into Drunkenneſs, Railing, Strife, Envying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall reade that theſe are the works of the fleſh, and that for theſe things ſake the wrath of God cometh on the children of diſobedience; and that every man ſhall be judged according to his works, and according to what he hath done in the fleſh; and that they that do ſuch things ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God; it cannot be but that his Aſſurance of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation muſt needs have ſo great a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on his obedience, as that theſe ſins will diminiſh it. When he reades <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.16. <hi>His ſervants ye are to whom ye obey, whether of ſinne unto death, or of obedience unto Righteouſneſs</hi>; he muſt needs think,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:57538:169"/>
how ſuch a time and ſuch a time he obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinne: and the oftner and the more wilfully he did it, the doubtfuller will his caſe be. Eſpecially if he be yet in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full courſe, which he might avoid, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of groſs ſinne, or any wilfull ſinne, it cannot be but this will obſcure the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his obedience. Men cannot judge beyond evidence: and he that hath not the evidence of his true obedience, hath not the evidence of the ſincerity of his Faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Moreover, Aſſurance and Comfort are Gods gifts; and without his gracious aid we cannot attain them. But God will not give ſuch gifts to his children while they ſtand out in diſobedience, but when they carefully pleaſe him. Paternal Juſtice requires this.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And it would do them abundance of hurt, and God much diſhonour if he ſhould either tell them juſt how oft or how farre they may ſin and yet be ſaved; or yet ſhould keep up their Peace and Comforts as well in their greateſt diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as in their tendereſt carefull walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him. But theſe things I ſpoke of before, and formerly elſewhere.</p>
               <p>You ſee then that though ſome obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent tender Chriſtians may yet on ſeveral
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:57538:169"/>
occaſions be deprived of Aſſurance; yet ordinarily no other but they have Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: And that Aſſurance and Comfort will riſe and fall with obedience.</p>
               <p>And for all the Antinomian objections againſt this, as if it were a leading men to their own righteouſneſs from Chriſt, I referre you to the twenty Arguments which I before laid you down to prove that we may and muſt fetch our Aſſurance and Comfort from our own works and Graces: and ſo from our own Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Righteouſneſs, which is ſubordinate to Chriſts Righteouſneſs (which he ſpeaks of, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. laſt; and in fourty places more;) though we muſt have no thoughts of a Legal Righteouſneſs (according to the Law of Works or Ceremonies) in our ſelves. They may as well ſay that a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man doth forſake her husband, becauſe ſhe comforteth her ſelf in this, that ſhe hath not forſaken him or been falſe and unchaſt, thence gathering that he will not give her a bill of Divorce: Or that a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant forſakes his Maſter; or a ſubject his Prince; or a Parent is forſaken by his childe; becauſe they comfort themſelves in their Obedience and Loyalty, gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thence that they are not flat Rebels, and ſhall not be uſed as Rebels! Or that
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:57538:170"/>
any that enter Covenant with Superiors do forſake them becauſe they comfort themſelves in their keeping Covenant, as a ſign that the Covenant ſhall be kept with them: All theſe are as wiſe collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as to gather that a man forſakes Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, and ſetteth up his own in ſtead of it, becauſe he looks at his not forſaking, refuſing and vilify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, his Love and faithfull obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Chriſt, as comfortable ſignes that Chriſt will not forſake and reject him. Do theſe men think that a Rebell may have the love of his Prince, and as much comfort from him as a Loyal ſubject? or a whoriſh woman have as much love and comfort from her husband, as a faithfull Wife? or a ſtubborn rebellious ſon or ſervant have as much love and comfort from their Father or Maſter as the duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full? If there be ſo near a Relation as hitherto we have ſuppoſed, between a Soveraign and ſubjection to him, and a Husband and Marriage-faithfulneſs to him, and a Maſter and ſervice to him, and a Father and loving obedience to him; it is ſtrange that men ſhould ſuppoſe ſuch a ſtrange oppoſition, as theſe men do?

honour? and if I be a Maſter where is my fear?</hi> And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.3, 4. <hi>Hear O heavens, and give ear O earth, for the Lord hath ſpoken: I have nouriſhed and brought up children and they have rebelled againſt me: The Ox knoweth his owner, and the Aſſe his Maſters crib: but Iſrael doth not know, my people doth not conſider: Ah ſinfull Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! a people laden with iniquity! a ſeed of evil doers! children that are corrupters! they have forſaken the Lord! they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the holy one of Iſrael to anger! they are gone away backward.</hi> And <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Thou ſhalt call me my Father, and ſhalt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part away from me.</hi> And 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. <hi>The Lord knoweth who are his:</hi> and <hi>let him that nameth the Name of Chriſt depart from iniquity.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.18. <hi>If I delight in iniquity or regard it, God will not hear my prayers,</hi> ſaith <hi>David</hi> himſelf. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Paul</hi> did not forſake Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs by confidence in his own, when he ſaith, <hi>This is our rejoycing, the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our Conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity we have had our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation among you,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.12. with many the like which I before mentioned. Nor doth the Lord Jeſus at the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment turn men off from his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when he ſaith, <hi>Well done good and
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:57538:171"/>
faithfull ſervant; becauſe thou haſt been faithfull in a very little, I will make thee ruler over much,</hi> Luke 19.17. Mat. 25.23. and cals them thereupon Righteous, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>And the righteous ſhall go into life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting,</hi> Mat. 25. laſt.</p>
               <p>It remains now that I further acquaint you what uſe you ſhould make of this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, concerning the dependance of Aſſurance upon actual obedience. And 1. I adviſe you, if your ſoul remain in doubts and troubles, and you cannot enjoy God in any way of peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, nor ſee any clear evidence of the ſincerity of your faith; take a ſerious view of your obedience: and faithfully ſurvey your heart and life, and your daily carriage to God in both. See whether there be nothing that provokes God to an unuſual Jealouſie. If there be, it is either the increaſe of ſome carnal intereſt in your heart, or elſe the wilfull or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent falling into ſome actual ſinne, of commiſſion or omiſſion. In the making of this ſearch you have need to be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cautelous; for if I have any acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the myſtery of this buſineſs, your peace or trouble, comfort or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort, will mainly depend on this. And your care muſt lie in this point; that
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:57538:171"/>
you diligently avoid theſe two extreams: Firſt, That you do not deal negligently and unfaithfully with your own ſoul, as either unwilling to know the truth, or unwilling to be at that labour which you muſt needs be at before you can know it. Secondly, That you do not either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn your ſelf when your conſcience doth acquit you, or vex your ſoul with needleſs ſcruples, or make unavoidable or ordinary infirmities to ſeem ſuch wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hainous ſinnes, as ſhould quite break your ſetled peace. O how narrow is the path between theſe two miſtaken roads? and how hard a thing, and how rare is it to finde it and to keep in it? For your ſelf and all tender conſcienc'd Chriſtians that are heartily willing to be Ruled by Chriſt, I would perſwade you equally to beware of both theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe ſome ſouls are as inclinable to the later extream as to the former (during their troubles.) But for the moſt Chriſtians in the world, I would have them firſt and principally avoid the former, and that with farre greater diligence then the later. For 1. Naturally all mens hearts are farre pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to deal too remiſly, yea unfaithfully with themſelves in ſearching after their ſins, then too ſcrupulouſly and tenderly.
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:57538:172"/>
The beſt men have ſo much pride and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſelf-love, that it will ſtrongly incline them to excuſe, or mince, or hide their ſinnes, and to think farre lightlier and more favourably of it then they ſhould do, becauſe it is theirs. How was the caſe altered with <hi>Judah</hi> towards <hi>Thamar,</hi> when he once ſaw it was his own act. How was <hi>Davids</hi> zeal for Juſtice allaied, as ſoon as he heard, <hi>Thou art the man?</hi> This is the moſt common cauſe why God is fain to hold our eyes on our tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by force, becauſe we are ſo loth to do it more voluntarily: and why he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our ſinne in ſuch crimſon and ſcarlet colours to us; becauſe we are ſo apt either to look on them as nothing, or to ſhut our eyes and over-look them: and why God doth hold us ſo long on the rack, becauſe we would ſtill eaſe our ſelves by uningenuous excuſes and extenuations: and why God doth break the skin ſo oft and keep open our wounds; becauſe we are ſtill healing them by ſuch carnal ſhifts. This proud ſin-excuſing diſtemper needs no other proof or diſcovery, then our great tenderneſs and backwardneſs in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to reproofs: How long do we excuſe ſinne, and defend our pretended innocency, as long we can finde a word
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:57538:172"/>
to ſay for it. Doth not daily experience of this ſad diſtemper even in moſt of the godly, diſcover fully to us, that moſt men (yea naturally all) are farre proner to over-look their ſinnes, and deal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfully and negligently in the triall; then to be too tender, and to charge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too deep.</p>
               <p>Beſides, If a Chriſtian be heartily wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to deal impartially and ſearch to the quick, yet the heart is lamentably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull, that he ſhall over-look much evil in it, when he hath done his beſt. And the devil will be farre more induſtrious to provoke and help you to hide, excuſe and extenuate ſinne, then to open it, and ſee it as it is. His endeavour to drive poor ſouls into terrours, is uſually but when he can no longer keep them in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption: When he can hide their ſin no longer, nor make it ſeem ſmall to keep them in impenitency, then he will make it ſeem unpardonable and remedileſs, if he can: but uſually not before. So that you ſee the frame of moſt mens ſpirits doth require them, to be rather over-jealous in ſearching after their ſinnes, then over-careleſs and confident of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Beſides this; I had rather of the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:57538:173"/>
two that Chriſtians would ſuſpect and ſearch too much then too little, becauſe there is a hundred times more danger in ſeeing ſinne leſs then it is, or overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, then in ſeeing it greater then it is, and being over-fearfull. The later miſtake may bring us into ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; and make our lives uncomfortable to us (and therefore ſhould be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:) but uſually it doth not endanger our happineſs; but is often made a great occaſion of our good. But the former miſtake may hazzard our everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting ſalvation, and ſo bring us to remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs trouble.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yea, leſt you ſhould ſay, <hi>This is ſad language to comfort a diſtreſſed wounded ſoul,</hi> let me adde this one Reaſon more. So farre as I can learn by reading the Scriptures, and by long experience of very many ſouls under troubles of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, <hi>It is moſt commonly ſome notable cheriſhed corruption that breedeth and feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſad uncomfortable ſtate of moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours, except thoſe who by melancholy or very great ignorance, are ſo weak in their Intellectuals, as that they are uncapable of making any true diſcovery of their condition, and of paſſing a right judgement upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thereupon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:57538:173"/>Leaſt I ſhould make ſad any ſoul that God would not have ſad, let me deſire you to obſerve, 1. That I ſay but <hi>of moſt Profeſſors,</hi> not all: For I doubt not but God may hide his face for ſome time from ſome of the holieſt and wiſeſt of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, for ſeveral and great reaſons. 2. Do but well obſerve moſt of the humble obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Chriſtians that you know to lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any long and ſad diſtreſs of minde, and you will finde that they are generally of one of the two forementioned ſorts: either ſo ignorant as not to know well what faith is, or what the conditions of the Covenant are, or what is the extent of the promiſe, or the full ſufficiency of Chriſts ſatisfaction for all ſinners, or what are the evidences by which they may try themſelves: Or elſe they are Melancholy perſons whoſe fancy is ſtill moleſted with theſe perturbing vapours and their underſtandings ſo clouded and diſtempered, that Reaſon is not free<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And ſo common is this later, that in my obſervation, of all the Chriſtians that have lived in any long and deep diſtreſs of minde, ſix if not ten for one have been deeply Melancholy; except thoſe that feed their troubles by diſobedience. So that beſides theſe ignorant and Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:57538:174"/>
perſons, and diſorderly declining Chriſtians, the number of wounded ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits I think is very ſmall, in compariſon of the reſt. Indeed it is uſual for many at or ſhortly after their firſt change to be under trouble and deep fears: But that is but while the ſenſe of former ſinne is freſh upon their hearts. The ſudden diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of ſo deep a guilt, and ſo great a danger, which a man did never know be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, muſt needs amaze and affright the ſoul: and if that fear remain long where right means are either not known or not uſed, for the cure, it is no wonder: and ſometimes it will be long if the righteſt means be uſed. But for thoſe that have been long in the Profeſſion of holineſs, and yet lye, or fall again, under troubles of ſoul (except thoſe before excepted) I would have them make a diligent ſearch, whether God do not obſerve either ſome fleſhly intereſt incroach upon his Right; or ſome actual ſin to be cheriſhed in their hearts or converſations?</p>
               <p>And here let me tell you, when you are making this ſearch, what particulars they be which I would have you to be moſt jealous of. 1. The former ſort which I call <hi>contrary carnal intereſt incroaching on Chriſts Right,</hi> are they that you muſt
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:57538:174"/>
look after with farre more diligence then your actual ſinnes. 1. Becauſe they are the farre greateſt and moſt dangerous of all ſinnes, and the root of all the reſt: for as God is the End and Chief Good of every Saint, ſo theſe ſinnes do ſtand up againſt him as our End and Chief good; and carry away the ſoul by that Act which we call <hi>ſimply willing, or compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,</hi> and ſo theſe intereſts are mens I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, and reſiſt Gods very Soveraignty and perfect Goodneſs, that is, They are againſt God himſelf as our God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thoſe which I now call Actual ſinnes as diſtinct from theſe, are but the violation of particular Precepts, and againſt Gods means and Laws directly, and but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely or indirectly againſt his Godhead; and they have but that act of our Will which we call <hi>Election, Conſent or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> which is proper to Means, and not to the End. 2. Becauſe as theſe ſinnes are the moſt damnable, ſo they lye deepeſt at the heart, and are not ſo eaſily diſcovered. It is ordinary with many to have a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, Worldly, Ambitious heart, even damnably ſuch, that yet have wit to carry it fairly without; yea and ſeem truly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious to themſelves and others. 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe ſinnes are the moſt common:
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:57538:175"/>
For though they reign only in hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites and other unſanctified ones, yet they dwell too much in all men on earth.</p>
               <p>If you now ask me what theſe ſinnes are: I anſwer, They are, as denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Point or Term from which men turn, all compriſed in this one <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs of God, or the turning of the heart from God; or not loving God</hi> But as we denominate them from the Term or Object to which they turn, they are all compriſed in this one, <hi>Carnal ſelf-love,</hi> or <hi>turning to and preferring our carnal ſelf before God,</hi> and as it inclineth to action, all or moſt of it is comprehended in this one word <hi>Fleſh-pleaſing.</hi> But becauſe there are a Trinity of ſinnes in this Unity, we muſt conſider them diſtinctly. Three great Objects there are about which this ſinne of <hi>Fleſh-pleaſing</hi> is exerciſed: 1. Credit or Honour. 2. Profit or Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. 3. Senſual Pleaſure, more ſtrictly ſo called, conſiſting in the more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Pleaſing of the ſenſes; Whereas the two firſt do more remotely pleaſe them, by laying in Proviſion to that end: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe all three are in the general but <hi>Fleſh-pleaſing.</hi> The three great ſinnes therefore that do moſt directly fight
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:57538:175"/>
againſt God himſelf in his Sovereignty, are 1. Pride or Ambition. 2. Worldlines or Love of Riches. 3. Senſuality, Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs, or inordinate Love of Pleaſures. There are in the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> indeed other ſinnes as directly againſt God as theſe, and more radicall (as 1. Atheiſm, denying a God. 2. Polutheiſm, denying our God to be the Alone God, and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others with him. 3. Idolatry, owning falſe Gods. 4. Infidelity, denying Jeſus Chriſt our Lord-Redeemer. 5. Owning falſe Saviours and Prophets, in his ſtead, or before him, as do the Mahometans. 6. Joyning other Redeemers and Saviours with him, as if he were not the alone Chriſt. 7. Denying the holy Ghoſt, and denying Credit to his Holy and Miraculous Teſtimony to the Chriſtian faith, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly aſcribing all to the devil: which is the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt. 8. Owning and believing in devils, or Lying ſpirits in ſtead of the Holy Ghoſt: as the Montaniſts, Mahometans, Ranters, Familiſts do. 9. Owning and adjoyning devils or Lying ſpirits in coordination or equality with the Holy Ghoſt, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving equally his doctrine and theirs, as if he were not ſole and ſufficient in his Work. All theſe are ſinnes directly againſt God
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:57538:176"/>
himſelf, and if prevalent, moſt certainly damning; three againſt the Father, three againſt the Sonne, and three againſt the Holy Ghoſt. But theſe be not they that I need now to warn you of. Theſe are prevalent only in Pagans, Infidels, and Blaſphemers. Your troubles and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints ſhew that theſe are not predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in you. It is therefore the three forementioned ſinnes of the Heart or Will that I would have you carefully to look after in your troubles, to ſee whether none of them get ground and ſtrength in you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Enquire carefully into your humility. It is not for nothing that Chriſt hath ſaid ſo much of the excellency and neceſſity of this Grace; When he bids us learn of him to be meek and lowly: when he bleſſeth the meek and poor in ſpirit: when he ſetteth a little child in the midſt of them, and telleth them, Except they become as that child they could not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven: when he ſtoopeth to waſh and wipe his Diſciples feet, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them to do ſo by one another. How oft doth the Holy Ghoſt preſs this upon us? Commanding us, to ſubmit our ſelves to one another: and not to minde high things; but to condeſcend to men of low
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:57538:176"/>
eſtate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.16. and not to be wiſe in our own eſteem, but in honour preferre others before our ſelves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.10. How oft hath God profeſſed to reſiſt and take down the Proud, and to give Grace to the humble and dwell with them? Search care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully therefore leſt this ſinne get ground upon you. For though it may not be ſo predominant and reigning as to damn you, yet may it cauſe God to afflict you and hide his face from you, and humble you by the ſenſe of his diſpleaſure, and the conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Love. And though one would think that doubting troubled ſouls ſhould be alwaies the moſt humble, and freeſt from pride, yet ſad experience hath certified me, that much pride may dwell with great doubtings and diſtreſs of minde. Even ſome of the ſame ſouls that cry out of their own unworthineſs, and fear leſt they ſhall be firebrands of Hell, yet cannot endure a cloſe reproof, eſpecially for any diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſin, nor cannot bear a diſparaging word, nor love thoſe, nor ſpeak well of them who do not value them, nor endure to be croſt or contradicted in word or deed, but muſt have all go their way, and follow their judgement, and ſay as they ſay, and dance after their pipe, and their hearts riſe aginſt thoſe that will not do it; much more againſt
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:57538:177"/>
thoſe that ſpeak or do any thing to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing of their Reputation: They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure to be low, and paſt by, and overlooked when others are preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, or to be ſlighted and diſreſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, or their words, or parts, or works, or judgements to be contemned or diſpara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: Nay ſome are ſcarce able to live in the ſame Houſe, or Church, or Town in love and peace with any but thoſe that will humour and pleaſe them, and ſpeak them fair, and give them ſmooth and ſtroaking language, and forbear croſſing, reproving and diſparaging them. Every one of theſe ſingly is an evident mark and fruit of pride; how much more all joyntly. I ſeriouſly profeſs it amazeth me to conſider how hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly moſt profeſſors are guilty of this ſin! even when they know it to be the devils own ſin, and the great abomination hated of God, and read and hear ſo much againſt it as they do, and confeſs it ſo oft in their praiers to God, and yet not only inwardly cheriſh it, but in words, actions, geſtures, apparel, expreſs it, and paſſionately defend theſe diſcoveries of it. The confuſions and diſtractions in Church and State are nothing elſe but the proper fruits of it: ſo are the contentions among Chriſtians, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceableneſs in families: For <hi>only from
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:57538:177"/>
pride cometh contention,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 13.10. For my part when I conſider the great meaſure of pride, ſelf-conceitedneſs, ſelf-eſteem that is in the greateſt part of Chriſtians that ever I was acquainted with, (we of the Miniſtry not excepted) I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that God doth not afflict us more, and bring us down by foul means that will not be brought down by fair. For my own part I have had as great means to help me againſt this ſin, as moſt men living have had, firſt in many years trouble of minde, and then in near twenty years languiſhing and bodily pains, having been almoſt twenty times at the graves mouth, and living near it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually; and laſtly, and above all, I have had as full a ſight of it in others, even in the generality of Profeſſors, and in the dolefull ſtate of the Church and State, and haynous deteſtable abominations of this age<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, which one would think ſhould have fully cured it. And yet if I hear but either an applauding word from any of fame, on one ſide, or a diſparaging word on the other ſide, I am fain to watch my heart as narrowly as I would do the thatch of my houſe when fire is put to it, and preſently to throw on it the water of Deteſtation, Reſolution, and Recourſe to God: And though the acts through Gods great mercy
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:57538:178"/>
be thus reſtrained, yet the conſtancy of theſe inclinations aſſures me, that there is ſtill a ſtrong and deep root. I beſeech you therefore, if you would ever have ſetled Peace and Comfort, be watchfull againſt this ſinne of Pride, and be ſure to keep it down, and get it mortified at the very heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next ſin that I would have you be ſpecially jealous of is coveteouſneſs, or love of the profits or riches of the world. This is not the ſin of the rich only, but alſo of the poor: and more hainous is it in them to love the world inordinatly that have ſo little of it, then in rich men that have more to tempt them: though dangerous in both. Nor doth it lye only in coveting that which is anothers, or in ſeeking to get by unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full means; but alſo in over-valuing and over-loving the wealth of the world though lawfully gotten. He that loveth the world (that is, above Chriſt and holineſs) the love of the Father is not in him (that is, ſavingly and ſincerely) 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15. He that loveth houſe or lands better then Chriſt cannot be his Diſciple. I beſeech you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when God hides his face, ſearch dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and ſearch again and again, leaſt the world ſhould encroach on Chriſts inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in your heart: If it ſhould be ſo, can
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:57538:178"/>
you wonder if Chriſt ſeem to withdraw, when you begin to ſet ſo light by him, as to value dung and earth in any compariſon with himſelf? May not he well ſay to you, <hi>If you ſet ſo much by the world, take it, and ſee what it will do for you? If you can ſpare me better then your wealth, you ſhall be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me.</hi> Muſt not the Lord Jeſus needs take it exceeding unkindly, that after all his love and bloodſhed and pains with your heart, and ſeals of his kindneſs, and diſcoveries of his Amiableneſs and the Treaſures of his Kingdom, you ſhould now ſo much forget and ſlight him, to ſet up the world in any compariſon with him? and to give ſuch loving entertainment to his enemy? and look ſo kindly on a competitor? Is his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry worth no more then ſo? and hath he deſerved no better at your hands? Again therefore do I beſeech you to be afraid, leſt you ſhould be guilty of this ſin. Examine, whether the thoughts of the world grow not ſweeter to you, and the thoughts of God and glory more unwelcome, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing? whether you have not an eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs after a fuller eſtate, and too keen an edge upon your deſires after riches? or at leaſt, after a fuller portion and proviſion for your children? or after better accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations and contentments in Houſe,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:57538:179"/>
Goods, or other worldly things? Do not worldly hopes delight you too much? and much more your worldly poſſeſſions? Are you not too buſily contriving how to be richer, forgetting Gods words, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.8, 9, 17. Doth not the world eat out the life of your duties, that when you ſhould be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious with God, you have left your heart behinde you, and drowned your affections in things below? Doth not your ſoul ſtick ſo faſt in this mud and clay, that you can ſcarce ſtirre it Godward in Prayer or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Meditation? Do not you cut ſhort duties in your family and in ſecret, if not frequently omit them, that ſo you may be again at your worldly buſineſs? Or do you not cuſtomarily hurry them over becauſe the world will not allow you leaſure to be ſerious? and ſo you have no time to deal in good earneſt with Chriſt or your ſoul? Do not your very ſpeeches of Chriſt and heaven grow few and ſtrange, becauſe the world muſt firſt be ſerved? When you ſee your brother have need, do you not ſhut up the bowels of your compaſſions from him? Doth not the love of the world make you hard to your ſervants? hard to thoſe you buy and ſell with? And doth it not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach much on the Lords own day? Look after this earthly vice in all theſe diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:57538:179"/>
ſearch for your enemy in each of theſe corners. And if you finde that this is indeed your caſe, you need not much wonder if Chriſt and you be ſtranger then heretofore. If this earth get between your heart and the Sun of Life, no wonder if all your Comforts are in an eclipſe; ſeeing your Light is but as the Moon's, a borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Light. And you muſt be the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in ſearching after this ſinne, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is certain that all men have too much of it, and becauſe it is of ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a nature, that ſhould it prevail, it would deſtroy: For coveteouſneſs is Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. And among all the hainous ſinnes that the godly have fallen into, look into the Scripture, and tell me how many of them you finde charged with coveteouſneſs? And alſo, becauſe it is a blinding befooling ſinne, not only drawing old men, and thoſe that have no children, and rich men, that have no need to purſue theſe things as madly as others; but alſo hiding it ſelf from their eyes, that moſt that are guilty of it will not know it: Though, alas, if they were but willing it were very eaſie to know it. But the power of the ſinne doth ſo ſet awork their wits to finde excuſes and fair names and titles for to cloak it, that many delude others by it, and more delude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,

but none can delude God. The caſe of ſome Profeſſors of Godlineſs that I have known is very lamentable in this point: who being generally noted for a dangerous meaſure of worldlineſs, by moſt that know them, could yet never be brought to acknowledge it in themſelves: Nay by the excellency of their outward duties and diſcourſe, and the ſtrength of their wits (alas, ill imployed) and by their great abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſpeech, to put a fair gloſs on the fouleſt of their actions, they have gone on ſo ſmoothly and plauſibly in their worldli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that though moſt accuſed them of it behinde their backs, yet no man knew how to faſten any thing on them. By which means they were hindered from repentance and recovery.</p>
               <p>In this ſad caſe, though it be Gods courſe very often to let hypocrites and other ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies go on and proſper, becauſe they have their portion in this life, and the reckoning is to come; yet I have oft obſerved that for Gods own people, or thoſe that he means to make his people by their recovery, God uſeth to croſs them in their worldly deſires and deſignes: Perhaps he may let them thrive a while, and congratulate the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of their fleſh, but at laſt he breaks in ſuddenly on their wealth, and ſcatters it
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:57538:180"/>
abroad, or addeth ſome croſs to it that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitters it all to them, and then asketh them, <hi>Where is now your Idol?</hi> and then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſee their folly. If you do dote on any thing below to the neglecting of God, he will make a rod for you of that very thing you dote upon; and by it will he ſcourge you home to himſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third great heart-ſinne which I would have you jealous of, is Senſuality or Voluptuouſneſs, or pleaſing the ſenſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately. The two former are in this the more mortall ſinnes, in that they carry more of the Underſtanding and Will with them, and make Reaſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it ſelf to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to them in their workings; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ſenſuality is more in the fleſh and paſſion, and hath oft times leſs aſſiſtance of Reaſon or Conſent of the Will. Yet is the Will tainted with ſenſual inclinations, and both Reaſon and Will are at the beſt guilty of connivence, and not exerciſing their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over the ſenſual part. But in this ſenſuality is the more dangerous vice, in that it hath ſo ſtrong and inſeparable a ſeat as our ſenſual appetite; and in that it act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſo violently and ragingly as it doth; ſo that it beareth down a weak oppoſition of Reaſon and Will, and carrieth us on blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, and transformeth us into bruits. I
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:57538:181"/>
will not here put the Queſtion concerning the groſs acting of this ſin (of that anon:) but I would have you very jealous of a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual diſpoſition. When a man cannot deny his appetite what it would have; or at leaſt, coveteouſneſs can do more in reſtraining it, then conſcience: When a man cannot make a Covenant with his eyes, but muſt gaze on every alluring object: When the fleſh draws to forbidden pleaſures, in meats, drinks, apparel, recreations, laſciviouſneſs, and all the conſiderations of Reaſon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſtrain it; this is a ſad caſe: and God may well give over ſuch to ſadneſs of heart. If we walk ſo pleaſingly to the fleſh, God will walk more diſpleaſingly to us.</p>
               <p>And as you ſhould be jealous of theſe great heart-tranſgreſſions, ſo ſhould you be of particular actual ſinnes. Examine whether the jealous eye of God ſee not ſomething that much offendeth him and cauſeth your heavineſs. I will not enlarge ſo farre as to minde you of the particular ſinnes that you ſhould look after, ſeeing it muſt be All, and your obedience muſt be univerſall. Only one I will give you a hint of. I have obſerved God ſometimes ſhew himſelf moſt diſpleaſed and angry to theſe Chriſtians, who have the leaſt tenderneſs and compaſſion towards the infirmities of
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:57538:181"/>
others. He that hath made the forgiving others a neceſſary condition of Gods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving us, will ſurely withdraw the ſenſe of our forgiveneſs, when we withdraw our forgiveneſs and compaſſion to men. He that caſts the unmercifull ſervant into hell, who takes his fellow-ſervant by the throat, will threaten us and frown upon us if we come but neer it. <hi>Bleſſed are the mercifull for they ſhall obtain mercy. He ſhall have judgement without mercy that ſheweth no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> Jam. 2.13. Study well <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. &amp; 15. Chap. &amp; <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. which the proud, cenſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſelf-eſteeming Profeſſors of this age have ſtudied ſo little, and will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. When we deal ſourly and churliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with our weak brethren, and in ſtead of winning an offendour by love, we will vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him, and diſdain him, and ſay, <hi>How can ſuch a man have any Grace?</hi> and will think and ſpeak hardly of thoſe that do but che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh any hopes that he may be gracious, or ſpeak of him with tenderneſs and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; no wonder if God force the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſuch perſons to deal as churliſhly and ſourly with them, and to clamour againſt them, and ſay, <hi>How canſt thou have any true grace, who haſt ſuch ſinnes as theſe?</hi> When our Lord himſelf dealt alway ſo tenderly with ſinners, that it gave occaſion to the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:57538:182"/>
ſlanderous Phariſees to ſay, He was <hi>a friend of Publicans and ſinners:</hi> (and ſo he was; even their greateſt friend.) And his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to us is, <hi>We then that are ſtrong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to pleaſe our ſelves: Let every one of us pleaſe his neighbour for his good to edification: For even Chriſt pleaſed not himſelf,</hi> Rom. 15.1.23. And <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1, 2. <hi>Brethren, if a man be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with a fault, ye which are ſpiritual reſtore ſuch a one in the ſpirit of meekneſs, conſidering thy ſelf, leſt thou alſo be tempted. Bear ye one anothers burden, and ſo fulfill the Law of Chriſt.</hi> When people can bear with almoſt no infirmity in a neighbour, in a ſervant, or in their neereſt friends, but will make the worſt of every fault, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if God make ſuch feel their dealings with others, by his dealings with them. Had ſuch that Love to their pooreſt bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, which thinketh no evil, and ſpeaketh not evil, which ſuffereth long and is kinde, <hi>envieth not, vaunteth not it ſelf, is not puffed up, behaveth not it ſelf unſeemly, ſeeketh not her own, is not eaſily provoked, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.4, 5, 7. Had we more of this love which covereth a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Infirmities; God would cover our Infirmities the more, and tell us of
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:57538:182"/>
them, and trouble us for them the leſs.</p>
               <p>To this ſinne I may adde another, which is ſcarce another, but partly the ſame with this, and partly its immediate effect: and that is, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>npeaceableneſs and unquietneſs with thoſe about us</hi>; this commonly occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth God to make us as unpeaceable and unquiet in our ſelves. When people are ſo froward, and peeviſh, and troubleſome, that few can live in peace with them, either in family or neighbourhood, except thoſe that have little to do with them, or thoſe that can humour them in all things, and have an extraordinary skill in ſmooth ſpeaking, flattering or man-pleaſing, ſo that neighbours, ſervants, children, and ſometimes their own yoak-fellows, muſt be gone from them, and may not abide near them, as a man gets out of the way from a wild beaſt or a mad dog, or avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the flames of a raging fire; is it any wonder if God give theſe people as little peace in their own ſpirits, as they give to others. When people are ſo hard to be pleaſed that no body about them or near them can tell how to fit their humours; neighbours cannot pleaſe them, ſervants cannot pleaſe them, Husband or Wife can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pleaſe each other; every word is ſpoke amiſs, and every thing done amiſs to them;
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:57538:183"/>
what wonder if God ſeem hard to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and as frequently offended with them? eſpecially if their unpeaceableneſs trouble the Church, and in their turbulency and ſelf-conceitedneſs, they break the peace thereof.</p>
               <p>Thus I have told you what ſinnes you muſt look after when you finde your peace broken, and your conſcience diſquieted; ſearch carefully leſt ſome iniquity lye at the root. Some I know will think that it is an unſeaſonable diſcourſe to a troubled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to minde them ſo much of their ſinnes, which they are apt to look at too much already. But to ſuch I anſwer, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe ſinnes are mortified and forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; or not: If they be; then theſe are not the perſons that I ſpeak of, whoſe trouble is fed by continued ſinne: but I ſhall ſpeak more to them anon. If not; then it ſeems for all their trouble of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſinne is not ſufficiently laid to heart yet.</p>
               <p>The chiefeſt thing therefore that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in all this diſcourſe, is this following advice to thoſe that upon ſearch do finde themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> guilty in any of theſe caſes. <hi>As ever you would have peace of conſcience, ſet your ſelves preſently againſt your ſinnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And do not either miſtakingly cry out of
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:57538:183"/>
one ſore, when it is another that is your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady; nor yet ſpend your daies in fears and diſquietneſs of minde, and fruitleſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainings, and in the mean time continue in wilfull ſinning: but reſiſt ſinne more, and torment your mindes leſs: and break off your ſin and your terrours together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe words I tell you what muſt be done for your cure; and I warn you of two ſore miſtakes of many ſad Chriſtians hereabouts. The cure lieth in breaking off ſinne, to the utmoſt of your power. This is the <hi>Achan</hi> that diſquieteth all. It is Gods great mercy that he diſquieteth you in ſinning, and gives you not over to ſo deep a ſlumber and peace in ſinne, as might hinder your repentance and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. The dangerous miſtakes here are theſe two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some do as the Lapwing, cry loudeſt when they are furtheſt from the neſt: and complain of an aking tooth, when the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe is in the head or heart. They cry out, <hi>O I have ſuch wandring thoughts in prayer, and ſuch a bad memory, and ſo hard a heart that I cannot weep for ſinne; or ſuch doubts and fears, and ſo little ſenſe of the Love of God, that I doubt I have no true Grace:</hi> When they ſhould rather ſay, <hi>I have ſo proud a heart, that God is fain by theſe
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:57538:184"/>
ſad means to humble me: I am ſo high in my own eyes, ſo wiſe in my own conceit, and ſo tender of my own eſteem and credit, that God is fain to make me baſe in my own eyes, and to abhorre my ſelf. I am ſo worldly and in love with earth, that it draws away my thoughts from God, duls my love, and ſpoils all my duties. I am ſo ſenſual that I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſooner to displeaſe my God then my fleſh: I have ſo little compaſſion on the infirmities of neighbours and ſervants and other bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and deal ſo cenſoriouſly, churliſhly and unmercifully with them, that God is fain to hide his mercy from me, and speak to me as in anger, and vex me as in ſore diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. I am ſo froward, peeviſh, quarrelſome, unpeaceable and hard to be pleaſed, that it is no wonder if I have no peace with God, or in my own conſcience; and if I have ſo little quietneſs who love and ſeek it no more.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have more reaſon, I ſay, to turn their complaints into this tune.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another moſt common unhappy miſcarriage of ſad Chriſtians lieth here, that <hi>They will rather continue complaining and ſelf-tormenting, then give over ſinning, ſo farre as they might give it over if they would.</hi> I beſeech you in the Name of God to know and conſider what it is that God requireth of you. He doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:57538:184"/>
your vexation but your reformation. No further doth he deſire the trouble of your minde, then as it tendeth to the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that ſinne which is the cauſe of it. God would have you leſs in your fears and troubles, and more in your obedience. Obey more, and diſquiet your minde leſs. Will you take this counſel preſently and ſee whether it will not do you more good, then all the complaints and doubtings of your whole life have done. Set your ſelf with all your might againſt your pride, worldlineſs and ſenſuality, your unpeace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs and want of love and tenderneſs to your brethren; and whatever other ſin your conſcience is acquainted with. I pray you tell me, If you had gravell in your ſhoe, in your travel, would it not be more wiſdom, to ſit down and take off your ſhoe, and caſt it out, then to ſtand ſtill or go complaining, and tell every one you meet of your ſoreneſs? If you have a thorn in your foot, will you go on halting and lamenting, or will you pull it out? Truly ſinne is the thorn in your conſcience: and thoſe that would not have ſuch troubled conſciences told of their ſinnes for fear of increaſing their diſtreſs, are unskilfull comforters; and will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the trouble while the thorn is in. As
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:57538:185"/>
ever you would have peace then, reſolve againſt ſinne to the utmoſt of your power: Never excuſe it, or cheriſh it, or favour it more. Confeſs it freely. Thank thoſe that reprove you for it. Deſire thoſe about you to watch over you, and to tell you of it: yea to tell you of all ſuſpitious ſignes that they ſee of it, though it be not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. And if you do not ſee ſo much Pride, Worldlineſs, Unpeaceableneſs or other ſinnes in your ſelf, as your friends think they ſee in you, yet let their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment make you jealous of your heart; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſelf-love doth oft ſo blinde us, that we cannot ſee that evil in our ſelves, which others ſee in us; nay which all the Town may take notice of. And be ſure to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage your friends that they ſhall not ſmooth over your faults, or mince them, and tell you of them in extenuating language, which may hinder Conviction and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; much leſs ſilence them, for fear of diſpleaſing you: but that they will deal freely and faithfully with you. And ſee that you diſtaſt them not, and diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance not their plain dealing, leſt you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them, and deprive your ſoul of ſo great a benefit. Think beſt of thoſe as your greateſt friends, who are leaſt friends to your ſinne, and do moſt for your reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:57538:185"/>
very from it. If you ſay, <hi>Alas, I am not able to mortifie my ſinnes: It is not in my power.</hi> I anſwer, 1. I ſpeak not of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect conqueſt: nor of a freedom from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry paſſion or infirmity. 2. Take heed of pretending diſability when it is unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. If you were heartily willing you would be able to do much, and God would ſtrengthen you. Cannot you reſiſt Pride, Worldlineſs and Senſuality if you be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? Cannot you forbear moſt of the actual ſinnes you commit, and perform the duties that you omit, if you be Willing? (though not ſo well as you would perform them?) Yea let me ſay this much, leſt I endanger you by ſparing you: Many a miſerable hypocrite doth live in trouble of minde and complaining, and after all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for their wilfull diſobedience. Did not the rich young man go farre before he would break off with Chriſt? and when he did leave him he went away ſorrowfull. And what was the cauſe of his ſorrow? Why the matter was, that he could not be ſaved without ſelling all and giving it to the poor, when he had great Poſſeſſions. It was not that he could not be rid of his ſinne: but that he could not have Chriſt and Heaven without forſaking the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is the caſe of unſanctified perſons that
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:57538:186"/>
are enlightened to ſee the need of Chriſt, but are not weaned from worldly profits, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and pleaſures; they are perhaps trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in minde, (and I cannot blame them) but it is not that they cannot leave ſinning, but that they cannot have Heaven without leaving their delights and contentments on earth. Sin as ſin they would willingly leave: For no man can love evil as evil. But their fleſhly profits, honours and pleaſures they will not leave; and there is the ſtop: and this is the cauſe of their ſorrows and fears. For their own judgement cries out againſt them, <hi>He that loveth the world, the love of the Father is not in him: If ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall die. God reſiſteth the proud.</hi> This is the voice of their informed underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: And conſcience ſeconds it and ſaith, <hi>Thou art the man.</hi> But the fleſh cries louder then both theſe, <hi>Wilt thou leave thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures? wilt thou undo thy ſelf? wilt thou be made a ſcorn or laughing ſtock to all?</hi> Or rather it ſtrongly draws and provoketh, when it hath nothing to ſay: No wonder if this poor ſinner be here in a ſtrait, and live in diſtreſs of minde. But as long as the fleſh holds ſo faſt, that all this conviction and trouble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will not cauſe it to loſe its hold, the poor ſoul is ſtill in the bonds of iniquity. The caſe of ſuch an hypocrite or half-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:57538:186"/>
is like the caſe of the poor Papiſt, that having glutted himſelf with fleſh in the Lent, was in this ſtrait that either he muſt vomit it up, and ſo diſcloſe his fault and undergo penance; or elſe he muſt be ſick of his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, and hazzard his life: But he reſolveth rather to venture on the danger, then to bear the penance. Or their caſe is like that of a proud woman, that hath got on a ſtrait garment, or a pinching ſhoe, and becauſe ſhe will not be out of the faſhion, ſhe will rather chooſe to bear the pain, though ſhe halt or ſuffer at every ſtep. Or like the more impudent ſort of them, who will endure the cold, and perhaps hazzard their lives, by the nakedneſs of their necks and breaſts and armes, rather then they will controul their ſhameleſs pride. What cure now ſhould a wiſe man wiſh to ſuch people as theſe? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the ſhoe might pinch yet a little harder, till the pain might force them to caſt it off. And that they might catch ſome cold that would pay them for their folly (ſo it would but ſpare their lives) till it ſhould force them to be aſhamed of their pride, and cover their nakedneſs: Even ſo when diſobedient hypocrites do complain that they are afraid they have no grace, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid God doth not pardon them, and will not ſave them, I ſhould tell them, if I knew
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:57538:187"/>
them, that I am afraid ſo to; and that it is not without cauſe; and deſire that their fears were ſuch, as might affright them from their diſobedience, and force them to caſt away their wilfull ſinning. I have ſaid the more on this point, becauſe I know if this advice do but help you to mortifie your ſin, the beſt and greateſt work is done, whether you get Aſſurance and comfort or no: and withall that it is the moſt probable means to this Aſſurance and Comfort.</p>
               <p>I ſhould next have warned you of the other extream, <hi>viz.</hi> needleſs ſcruples; but I mean to make that a peculiar Direction by it ſelf, when I have firſt added a little more of this great means of Peace, <hi>A ſound Obedience,</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p n="24">24. <hi>My next advice for the obtaining of a ſetled Peace and Comfort, is this</hi>: [Take heed that you content not your ſelf with a cheap courſe of Religion, and ſuch a ſerving of God as coſteth you little or nothing: But in your abſtaining from ſin, in your riſing out of ſin, and in your diſcharge of Duty, incline moſt to that way which is moſt ſelf-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and diſpleaſing to the fleſh (ſo you be ſure it be a lawful way.) And when you are called out to any work which will ſtand you in extraordinary labour and coſt, you muſt be ſo far from ſhrinking and drawing your neck out of the yoke, that you muſt look upon it as a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial prize that is put into your hand, &amp; a ſingular advantage &amp; opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for the <hi>increaſe</hi> of your <hi>comforts.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THIS Rule is like the reſt of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine, which is not throughly underſtood by any way but experience.

Libertines and ſenſual Profeſſors that never tryed it, did never well underſtand it. I could find in my heart to be large in explaining and applying it, but that I have been ſo large be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my firſt intentions in the former Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, that I will cut off the reſt as ſhort as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But I muſt tell you theſe two things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That a cheap Religion is a far more uncertain evidence of ſincerity, then a dear. it will not diſcover ſo well to a mans own ſoul, whether he prefer Chriſt before the world, and whether he take him and his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits for his Portion and Treaſure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That a cheap Religion is not uſually accompanied with any notable degree of Comforts, although the perſon be a ſincere-hearted Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Every Hypocrite can ſubmit to a Religion that will coſt him little: much more which will get Reputation with men of greateſt Wiſdom and Piety: Yea he may ſtick to it, ſo it will not undo him in the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If a man have knowledge, and gifts of utterance, and ſtrength of body, it is no coſtly matter
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:57538:188"/>
to ſpeak many good words, or to be earneſt in oppoſing the ſins of others, and to preach zealouſly and frequently (much more if he have double honour by it, Reverent Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Maintenance, as Miniſters of the Goſpel have, or ought to have.) It is hard to diſcern ſincerity in ſuch a courſe of Piety and Duty. Wo to thoſe Perſecutors that ſhall put us to the Trial, how far we can go in ſuffering for Chriſt: but it ſhould be a matter of Rejoycing to us, when we are put upon it. To be Patient in Tribulation is not enough: but to Rejoyce in it, is alſo the duty of a Saint. Let thoſe that think this draweth men to Rejoyce too much in themſelves, but hear what the Lord Jeſus himſelf ſaith, and his Spirit in his Apoſtles, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5 10, 11, 12. <hi>Bleſſed are they which are perſecuted for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſake, for theirs is the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.

Oh how gloriouſly doth a tried faith ſhine, to the comfort of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, and the admiration of the Beholders? How eaſily may a Chriſtian try himſelf at ſuch a time when God is trying him? One hours experience, when we have found that our faith can endure the furnace, and that we can hazard or let go all for Chriſt, will more effectually reſolve all our doubtings of our ſincerity, then many a months trial by meer queſtioning of our own deceitful hearts.</p>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> But (you may ſay) what if God call me not to ſuffering or hazards? muſt I caſt my ſelf upon it without a Call? or muſt I be therefore without Comfort?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No; you ſhall not need to caſt your ſelf upon ſuffering; nor yet to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Comfort for want of it. I know no man but may ſerve God at dearer rates to the fleſh then moſt of us do, without ſtepping out of the way of his duty: Nay he muſt do it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he will avoyd his duty. Never had the Church yet ſuch times of proſperity, but that faithful duty would hazard men, and cauſe their trouble in the fleſh. Can you not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nay
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:57538:189"/>
ought you not to put your ſelf to greater la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for mens ſouls? If you ſhould but go day after day among the poor ignorant people where you live, and inſtruct them in the knowledge of God, and bear with all their weakneſs and rudeneſs, and continue thus with Patience; this might coſt you ſome la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and perhaps contempt from many of the unthankful: and yet you ſhould not do more then your duty, if you have opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for it, as moſt have, or may have, if they will. If you ſhould further hire them to learn Catechiſms; if you ſhould extend your liberality to the utmoſt for relief of the poor, this would coſt you ſomewhat. If you carry on every Juſt Cauſe with Reſolution, though never ſo many great friends would draw you to betray it: this may coſt you the loſs of thoſe friends. If you will but deal plainly with the ungodly, and againſt all ſin, as far as you have opportunity, eſpecially if it be the ſins of Rulers and Gentlemen of name and power in the world; it may coſt you ſomewhat. Nay though you were Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of Chriſt, whoſe office is to deal plainly, and not to pleaſe men in evil upon pain of Chriſts diſpleaſure; you may perhaps turn your great friends to be your great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Go to ſuch a Lord, or ſuch a Knight, or ſuch a Gentleman, and tell him freely,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:57538:190"/>
that God looketh for another manner of ſpending his time then in hunting and hawk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſporting and feaſting, and that this precious time muſt be dearly reckoned for: Tell him, that God looks he ſhould be the moſt eminent in Holineſs, and in a Heavenly life, and give an example thereof to all that are below him, as God hath made him more eminent in worldly dignity and poſſeſſions. Tell him, that where much is given, much is required; and that a low profeſſion, and dull approbation of that which is good, will ſerve no man, much leſs ſuch a man. Tell him, that his Riches muſt be expended to feed and cloath the poor, and promote good uſes, and not meerly for himſelf and family, or elſe he will make but a ſad account: and that he muſt freely engage his reputation, eſtate and life, and all for Chriſt and his Goſpel, when he cals him to it; yea and forſake all for him, if Chriſt put him to it, or elſe he can be no Diſciple of Chriſts: and then what good will his Honours and Riches do him, when his Soul ſhall be called for? Try this courſe with Great men, yea with Great men that ſeem religious, and that no further then faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and compaſſion to mens ſouls doth bind you, and do it with all the wiſdom you can, that is not carnal; and then tell me what it doth coſt you. Let thoſe Miniſters
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:57538:190"/>
that are near them, plainly and roundly tell both the Parliament-men, and Commanders of the Army, of their unqueſtionable tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and that according to their nature, (and wo to them if they do not) and then let them tell me what it doth coſt them. Alas Sirs, how great a number of Profeſſors are baſe, daubing, ſelf-ſeeking Hypocrites, that cull out the ſafe, the cheap, the eaſy part of duty, and leave all the reſt! And ſo ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily is this done, that we have made us a new Chriſtianity by it; and the Religion of Chriſts own making, the ſelf-denying courſe preſcribed by our Maſter, is almoſt unknown; and he that ſhould practice it would be taken for a madman, or ſome ſelf-conceited Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick, or ſome ſaucy, if not ſeditious fellow. It is not therefore becauſe Chriſt hath not preſcribed us a more ſelf-denying, hazardous, laborious way, that men ſo commonly take up in the Cheapeſt Religion: but it is through our falſe-heartedneſs to Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the ſtrength of ſenſual carnal Intereſts in us, which make us put falſe Interpretations on the plaineſt precepts of Chriſt which charge any unpleaſing duty on us, and Familiſtically turn them into Allegories, or at leaſt we will not yield to obey him. And, truly, I think that our ſhifting off Chriſt in this unworthy manner, and even altering that very frame
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:57538:191"/>
and nature of Chriſtian Religion (by turning that into a fleſh-pleaſing Religion, which is more againſt the fleſh then all the Religions elſe in the world) and dealing ſo reſervedly, ſuperficially and unfaithfully in all his work, is a great cauſe why Chriſt doth now appear no more openly for men, and pour out no larger a meaſure of his Spirit in Gifts and Conſolations. When men appeared ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily in the moſt open manner for Chriſt, in greateſt dangers and ſufferings: then Chriſt appeared more openly and eminently for them (yet is none more for meekneſs, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and love, and againſt unmerciful or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding zeal, then Chriſt.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as you ſee that a cheap Religiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs doth not to diſcover ſincerity: ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it is not accompanied with that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial bleſſing of God. As God hath engaged himſelf in his Word, that they ſhall not loſe their Reward that give but a cup of water in his name: ſo he hath more fully engaged himſelf to thoſe that are moſt deeply engaged for him; even that they that forſake all for him, ſhall have manifold recompence in this life, and in the world to come eternal life. Let the experience of all the world of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians be produced, and all will atteſt the ſame truth, That it is Gods uſual courſe to give men larger Comforts in dearer duties,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:57538:191"/>
then in cheap: Nay ſeldom doth he give large Comforts in cheap duties: and ſeldom doth he deny them in dearer, ſobeit they are not made dear by our own ſin and fooliſh indiſcretion, but by his command, and our faithfulneſs in obeying him. Who knows not that the Conſolation of Martyrs is uſually above other mens, who hath read of their ſufferings and ſtrange ſuſtentations? Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, do but try this by thy own experiences, and tell me, when thou haſt moſt reſolutely followed Chriſt in a good Cauſe; when thou haſt ſtood againſt the faces of the greateſt for God; when thou haſt caſt thy life, thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and eſtate upon Chriſt, and run thy ſelf into the moſt apparent hazards for his ſake: haſt not thou come off with more inward peace and comfort, then the cheaper part of thy Religion hath afforded thee? When thou haſt ſtood to the Truth and Goſpel, and haſt done Good through the greateſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and loſt thy greateſt and deareſt friends becauſe thou wouldſt not forſake Chriſt and his ſervice, or deal falſly in ſome Cauſe that he hath truſted thee in: haſt not thou come off with the bleſſing of Peace of Conſcience? Nay, when thou haſt denied thy moſt importunate Appetite, and moſt croſſed thy luſts, and moſt humbled and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed thy ſelf for God, and denied thy
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:57538:192"/>
credit, and taken ſhame to thy ſelf in a free confeſſing of thy faults, or patiently put up the greateſt abuſes, or humbled and tamed thy fleſh by neceſſary abſtinence, or any way moſt diſpleaſed it, by croſſing its intereſt, by bountiful giving, laborious duty, dangers or ſufferings for the ſake of the Lord Jeſus, his Truth and People: hath it not been far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with thee in thy Peace and Comforts then before? I know ſome will be ready to ſay, That may be from Carnal Pride in our own doing or ſuffering. I anſwer; It may be ſo: And therefore let all watch againſt that. But I am certain that this is Gods ordinary deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his people, and therefore we may ordinarily expect it: It is for their encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in faithful duty; and I may truly ſay, for their Reward, when himſelf cals that a Reward which he gives for a cup of water. Lay well to heart that Example of <hi>Abraham</hi> for which he is ſo often extolled in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>viz.</hi> his readineſs to ſacrifice his only Son: This was a dear Obedience: <hi>And,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Becauſe</hi> (mark <hi>Becauſe</hi>) <hi>thou haſt done this thing, in bleſſing I will bleſs thee, &amp;c. David</hi> would not offer to God that which coſt him nothing , 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.24. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.24.

<pb n="323" facs="tcp:57538:192"/>
                  <hi>Abels</hi> ſacrifice was of the beſt, and it was accepted: And God ſaith to <hi>Cain, If thou do well, ſhalt not thou be accepted</hi>?</p>
               <p>Seeing this is ſo, let me adviſe you; Take it not for a calamity, but for a precious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, when God cals thee to a hazardous coſtly ſervice, which is like to coſt thee much of thy eſtate, to coſt thee the loſs of thy chiefeſt friends, the loſs of thy credit, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of Great ones, or the painfulleſt diligence and trouble of body: Shift it not off, but take this opportunity thankfully, leſt thou never have ſuch another for the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thy ſincerity, and the obtaining of more then ordinary Conſolations from God: Thou haſt now a Prize in thy hand for ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual riches, if thou have but a heart to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it. I know all this is a paradox to the unbelieving world: But here is the very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Chriſtian Religion, and the Glory of Faith. It looks for its greateſt ſpoyls, and richeſt prizes from its Conqueſts of fleſhly Intereſts: It is not only able to do it, but it expecteth its advancement and conſolations by this way. It is engaged in a war with the world and fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in this war it plays not the vapouring fencer, that ſeems to do much, but never ſtrikes home, as Hypocrites and carnal worldly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors do: but he lays it home and ſpares
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:57538:193"/>
not, as one that knows, That the fleſhes ruine muſt be his Riſing, and the fleſhes thriving would be his Ruine. In theſe things the true Chriſtian alone is in good ſadneſs, and all the reſt of the world but in jeſt. The Lord pity poor deluded ſouls! You may ſee by this one thing, how rare a thing true Chriſtianity is among the Multitude that take themſelves for Chriſtians! and how certain therefore it is that few ſhall be ſaved! Even this one point of true Mortification, and ſelf-denial, is a ſtranger among the moſt of Profeſſors. Oh how ſad a teſtimony of it are the actions of theſe late times, wherein ſo much hath been done for ſelf, and ſafety, and carnal intereſts, and ſo little for Chriſt! yea, and that after the deepeſt engagements of Mercies and Vows that ever lay on a people in the world: Inſomuch that through the juſt judgement of God, they are now given up to doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the duty of Rulers to do any thing as Rulers for Chriſt, or no? or whether they ſhould not let Chriſt alone to do it himſelf? Well, this which is ſuch a myſterie to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate world, is a thing that every ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Chriſtian is acquainted with: for they that are Chriſts have crucified the fleſh, with the affections and luſts thereof; and the world is dead to them, and they to the world, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.11.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:57538:193"/>Take this counſel therefore in all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral caſes mentioned in the Direction:</p>
               <p n="1">1. In your preventing ſin, and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Innocency, if you cannot do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out denying your credit, and expoſing your ſelf to diſgrace; or without the loſs of friends, or a breach in your eſtate, do it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs: Yea, if it would coſt you your utter ruine in the world, thank God that put ſuch an opportunity into your hand for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Conſolations: For ordinarily the Martyrs Comforts exceed other mens, as much as their burthen of duty and ſuffering doth. <hi>Cyprian</hi> is fain to write for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of ſome Chriſtians in his times, that at death were troubled that they miſt of their hopes of Martyrdom. So alſo if you cannot mortifie any luſt without much pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fleſh, do it chearfully; for the dearer the victory coſteth you, the ſweeter will be the iſſue and review.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſame counſel I give you alſo in your riſing from ſin. It is the ſad condition of thoſe that yield to a Temptation, and once put their foot within the dores of Satan, that they enſnare themſelves ſo, that they muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo thrice as great difficulties to draw back, as they needed to have done before-hand for prevention and forbearance. Sin unhappily engageth the ſinner to go on; and
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:57538:194"/>
one ſin doth make another ſeem neceſſary. O how hard a thing is it for him that wrong'd another by ſtealing, deceit, over-reaching in bargaining, or the like, to confeſs his fault, and ask him forgiveneſs, and to the utmoſt of his ability to make reſtitution! What abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of difficulties will be in the way? It will likely coſt him the loſs of his Credit, beſides the breach in his eſtate, and perhaps lay him open to the rage of him that he hath wronged. Rather he will be drawn to cover his ſin with a Lye, or at leaſt by Excuſes. And ſo it is in many other ſins. Now in any of theſe Caſes, when men indulge the fleſh, and cannot find in their hearts to take that loſs or ſhame to themſelves, which a through-Repentance doth require, they do but feed the troubles of their ſoul, and hide their wounds and ſores, and not eaſe them. Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuch perſons go on in a galled, unpeace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able condition, and reach not to ſolid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: (I ſpeak only of thoſe to whom ſuch Confeſſion or Reſtitution is a duty.) And I cannot wonder at it: For they have great cauſe to queſtion the truth of that Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and conſequently the ſoundneſs of that heart, which will not bring them to a ſelf-denying duty, nor to Gods way of riſing from their ſin. It ſeems at preſent the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the fleſh is actually predominant,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:57538:194"/>
when no Reaſon or Conviction will perſwade them to contradict it. As ever you would have ſound Comfort then in ſuch a Caſe as this, ſpare not the fleſh. When you have ſinned, you muſt riſe again or periſh. If you cannot riſe without faſting, without free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing, without the utter ſhaming of your ſelves, without reſtitution; never ſtick at it. This is your hour of Trial: O yield not in the Conflict. The dearer the Victory coſteth you, the greater will be your Peace. Try it; and if you find it not ſo, I am miſtaken. Yet if you have ſinned ſo that the opening of it may more diſcredit the Goſpel, then your Confeſſion will honour it, and yet your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is unquiet, and urgeth you to confeſs; in ſuch a caſe be firſt well informed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed warily and upon deliberation; and firſt open the caſe to ſome faithful Miniſter or able Chriſtian in ſecret, that you may have good advice.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſame counſel alſo would I give you in the performance of your duty. A Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate is convinced he muſt puniſh ſinners, and put down Ale-houſes, and be true to every Juſt Cauſe: but then he muſt ſteel his face againſt all mens reproaches, and the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations of all friends. A Miniſter is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that he muſt teach from houſe to houſe, as well as publickly, if he be able; and
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:57538:195"/>
that he muſt deal plainly with ſinners ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their conditions; yea and require the Church to avoyd Communion with them, if they be obſtinate in evill after other ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient means: But then he ſhall loſe the Love of his People, and be accounted Proud, Preciſe, Rigid, Lordly, and perhaps loſe his maintenance. Obey God now; and the dearer it coſteth you, the more Peace and Protection, and the larger bleſſing may you expect from God: For you do (as it were) oblige God the more to ſtick to you; as you will take your ſelf obliged to own, and bear out, and reward thoſe that hazard ſtate, and credit, and life for you. And if you cannot obey God in ſuch a Trial, it is a ſad ſign of a falſe-hearted Hypocrite: except your fall be only in a temptation, from which you riſe with renewed Repentance and Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which will conquer for the time to come. As <hi>Peter,</hi> who being left to himſelf for an example of humane frailty, and that Chriſt might have no friend to ſtick by him when he ſuffered for our ſin, yet preſently wept bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, and afterward ſpent his ſtrength and time in preaching Chriſt, and laid down his life in Martyrdom for him.</p>
               <p>So perhaps many a poor ſervant, or hard labourer, hath ſcarce any time except the Lords day to Pray or Read. Let ſuch pinch
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:57538:195"/>
the fleſh a little the more (ſo they do not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow their health) and either work the harder, or fare the harder, or be cloathed the more meanly, or eſpecially break a little of their ſleep, that they may find ſome time for theſe duties; and try whether the Peace and Comfort will not Recompence it. Never any man was a loſer for God! So private Chriſtians cannot conſcionably diſcharge the great plain duty of Reproof and Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; lovingly, yet plainly telling their friends and neighbours of their ſins, and danger, and duty, but they will turn friends into foes, and poſſibly ſet all the Town on their heads. But is it a Duty, or is it not? If it be, then truſt God with the Iſſue, and do your work, and ſee whether he will ſuffer you to be loſers.</p>
               <p>For my part I think, that if Chriſtians took Gods work before them, and ſpared the fleſh leſs, and truſted themſelves and all to Chriſt alone, and did not balk all the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom coſtly part of Religion, and that which moſt croſſeth the intereſt of the fleſh; it would be more ordinary with them to be filled with the joys of the Holy Ghoſt, and walk in that Peace of Conſcience which is a Continual Feaſt; and to have ſuch full and frequent views both of the ſincerity of their Evidencing Graces, and of Gods Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:57538:196"/>
Face, as would baniſh their doubts and fears, and be a greater help to their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of ſalvation, then much other labour doth prove. If you flinch not the fiery fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, you ſhall have the company of the Son of God in it. If you flinch not the Priſon and Stocks, you may be able to ſing as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> did. If you refuſe not to be ſtoned with <hi>Stephen,</hi> you may perhaps ſee Heaven open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as he did. If you think theſe Comforts ſo dear bought, that you will rather ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without them; let me tell you, you may take your courſe, but the end will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you to the very heart, of the folly of your choyce. Never then complain for want of Comfort; remember you might have had it, and would not. And let me give you this with you: You will ſhortly find, though worldly Pleaſures, Riches and Honours were ſome ſlight ſalves to your moleſted Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence here, yet there will no cure nor eaſe for it be found hereafter: Your merry hours will then all be gone, and your worldly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights forſake you in Diſtreſs: but theſe ſolid Comforts which you judged too dear, would have ended in the Everlaſting Joys of Glory. When men do flinch God and his Truth in ſtraits, and juggle with their Conſciences, and will take out all the honourable, eaſy, cheap part of the work of Chriſt, and make a
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:57538:196"/>
Religion of that by it ſelf, leaving out all the diſgraceful, difficult, chargeable, ſelf-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part; and hereupon call themſelves Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and make a great ſhew in the world with this kind of Religiouſneſs, and take themſelves injured if men queſtion their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and uprightneſs in the faith: theſe men are notorious ſelf-deceivers, meer Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites; and in plain truth, this is the very true deſcription by which damnable Hypocrites are known from ſound Chriſtians. The Lord open mens eyes to ſee it in time while it may be cured. Yea, and the nearer any true Chriſtian doth come to this ſin, the more doth he diſ-oblige God, and quench the Spirit of Comfort, and darken his own Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, and deſtroy his Peace of Conſcience, and create unavoydable Troubles to his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and eſtrangedneſs betwixt the Lord Jeſus and his own ſoul. Avoyd this therefore, if ever you will have Peace.</p>

Think which way you may do moſt, firſt, to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Goſpel, and the Publique Good of
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:57538:199"/>
the Church: and then, which way you may help towards the ſaving of particular mens ſouls; and then which way you may better the Commonwealth; and how you may do good to mens bodies; beginning with your own, and thoſe of your family, but extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your help as much further as you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Ask your ſelf every morning, Which way may I this day moſt further my Maſters buſineſs, and the Good of men? Ask your ſelf every night, What Good have I done to day? And labour as much as may be, to be Inſtruments of ſome great and ſtanding Good, and of ſome Publick and Univerſal Good; that you may look behind you at the years end, and at your lives end, and ſee the Good that you have done. A piece of bread is ſoon eaten, and a peny or a ſhilling is ſoon ſpent: But if you could win a Soul to God from ſin, that would be a viſible everlaſting Good: If you could be Inſtruments of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up a Godly Miniſter in a Congregation that want, the everlaſting Good of many Souls might in part be aſcribed to you: If you could help to heal and unite a Divided Church, you might more rejoyce to look back on the fruits of your labour, then any Phyſician may Rejoyce to ſee his poor Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient recovered to health. I have told Rich men in another Book, what opportunities
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:57538:200"/>
they have to do Good if they had hearts: How eaſy were it with them to refreſh mens bodies, and to do very much for the ſaving of ſouls! To relieve the poor; to ſet their Children to trades; to eaſe the oppreſſed. How eaſy to maintain two or three poor Scholars at the Univerſities for the ſervice of the Church? But I hear but of few that do ever the more in it, except three or four of my friends in theſe parts. Let me further tell you, God doth not leave it to them as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different thing. <hi>Math.</hi> 25. They muſt feed Chriſt in the poor, or elſe ſtarve in Hell themſelves: They muſt cloath naked Chriſt in the poor, or be laid naked to his fiery indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ever. How much more diligently then muſt they help mens ſouls, and the Church of Chriſt, as the need is greater, and the work better<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Oh the blinding power of Riches! O the eaſineſs of mans heart to be deluded! Do Rich men never think to lie rotting in the duſt? do they never think that they muſt be accountable for all their Riches? and for all their Time, and Power, and Intereſts? Do they not know that it will comfort them more at Death &amp; Judgement, to hear in their reckoning, <hi>Item</hi> ſo much given to ſuch &amp; ſuch Poor? ſo much to promote the Goſpel? ſo much to maintain poor Scholars while they ſtudy to prepare themſelves for the Miniſtry?
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:57538:200"/>
&amp;c. then to hear, ſo much in ſuch a Feaſt? to entertain ſuch Gallants? to pleaſe ſuch No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble friends? ſo much at dice, at cards, at horſe-races, at cock-fights? ſo much in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Apparel? and the reſt to leave my Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity in the like pomp? Do they not know that it will comfort them more to hear then of their time ſpent in Reading Scripture, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and open Prayer, Inſtructing and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining their Children and Servants; going to their poor Neighbours houſes to ſee what they want, and to perſwade them to godlineſs; and in being examples of eminent holineſs to all; and in ſuppreſſing Vice, and doing Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; then to hear of ſo much time ſpent in Vain Recreations, Viſits, Luxuries and Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? O deep Unbelief and hardneſs of heart, that makes Gentlemen that they tremble not to think of this Reckoning: Well, let me tell both them and all men, that if they knew but either that undiſpenſable duty of Doing Good, that lieth on them, or how neceſſary and ſure a way (in ſubordination to Chriſt) this act of Doing Good is for the ſouls Peace and conſolation, they would ſtudy it better, and practice it more faithfully then now they do: They would then be glad of an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to do Good, for their own Gain, as well as for Gods honour, and for the love of Good it ſelf. They would know that lending
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:57538:201"/>
to the Lord is the onely thriving Uſury; and that no part of all their Time, Riches, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in men, Power or Honours will be then comfortable to them, but that which was laid out for God; And they will one day find, that God will not take up with the ſcraps of their Time and Riches which their fleſh can ſpare; but he will be firſt ſerved, even before all comers, and that with the beſt, or he will take them for no ſervants of his. This is true, and you'l find it ſo, whether you will now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it or no.</p>
               <p>And becauſe it is poſſible theſe lines may fall into the hands of ſome of the Rulers of this Commonwealth, let me here mind them of two weighty things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What opportunities of Doing very great Good hath been long in their hands? and how great an account of it they have to make. It hath been long in their power to have done much to the Reconciling of our Differences, and healing our Diviſions, by ſetting Divines a work of different Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to find out a temperament for Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation. It hath long been in their power to have done much towards the ſupply of all the dark Congregations in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> with competently able, ſound and faithful Teachers! We have many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations that do contain three thouſand, five
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:57538:201"/>
thouſand, or ten thouſand ſouls, that have but one or two Miniſters, that cannot poſſibly do the tenth part of the Miniſterial work of Private overſight; and ſo poor ſouls muſt be neglected, let Miniſters be never ſo able or painful: We have divers Godly Private Chriſtians of ſo much underſtanding as to be capable of helping us as Officers in our Churches: but they are all ſo poor that they are not able to ſpare one hour in a day or two from their labour, much leſs to give up themſelves to the work: How many a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation is in the ſame Caſe? Nothing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt is wanting to us to have ſet our Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations in the order of Chriſt, and done this great work of Reformation which there is ſo much talking of, ſo much as want of Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for a Competent Number of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters or Elders to attend the work. I am ſure in great Congregations this is the Caſe, and a ſore that no other means will remedy. Was it never in the power of our Rulers to have helpt us here? Was nothing ſold for other uſes, that was once Devoted and Dedicated to God, and might have helpt us in this our miſerable diſtreſs? Were our Churches able to maintain their own Officers, our Caſe were more tolerable: but when a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation that wants ſix, or ſeven, or ten, is not able to maintain one, it is hard.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="342" facs="tcp:57538:202"/>2. The ſecond thing that I would mind our Rulers of, is, What mortal Enemies thoſe men are to their ſouls, that would perſwade them that they muſt not, as Rulers, Do Good to the ſouls of men, and to the Church as ſuch; nor further the Reformation, nor propagate the Goſpel, nor ſtabliſh Chriſts orders in the Churches of their Country, any otherwiſe then by a common maintaining the Peace and Liberties of all. What doctrine could more deſperately undo you if enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained? If you be once perſwaded that it belongs not to you to <hi>Do Good,</hi> and the Greateſt Good, to which all your ſucceſſes have but made way, then all the Comfort, the Bleſſing and Reward is loſt: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently all the Glorious preparative ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, as to you, are loſt: If once you take your ſelves to have nothing to do as Rulers for Chriſt, you cannot promiſe your ſelves that Chriſt will have any thing to do for you as Rulers in a way of Mercy: This Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> hath lately told you in his Sermon, <hi>Oct.</hi> 13. <hi>The God of Heaven forbid, that ever all the Devils in Hell, the Jeſuits at Rome, or the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſouls in England, ſhould be able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Rulers of this Land, who are ſo deeply bound to God by Vows, Mercies, Profeſſions, and high expences of treaſure and blood, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his Church, and propagate his Goſpel; that
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:57538:202"/>
now after all this it belongeth not to them, but they muſt as Rulers be no more for Chriſt the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> for Mahomet: But if ever it ſhould prove the ſad caſe of England to have ſuch Rulers (which I ſtrongly hope will never be) if my Prognoſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ks fail not, this will be their fate: The Lord Jeſus will forſake them, as they have forſaken him, &amp; the Prayers of his Saints will be fully turned againſt them; and his Elect ſhall cry to him night and day, till he avenge them ſpeedily, by making theſe his enemies to l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Perhaps you may think I Digreſs from the matter in hand: But as long as I ſpeak but for my Lord Chriſt, and for <hi>Doing Good,</hi> I cannot think that I am quite out of my way. But to return nearer to thoſe for whoſe ſakes I chiefly write: This is that ſum of my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: Study with all the underſtanding you have, how to do as much Good while you have time as poſſibly you can, and you ſhall find that (without any Popiſh or Phariſaical ſelf-confidence) to be the moſt excellent art for obtaining ſpiritual Peace, and a large meaſure of comfort from Chriſt.</p>
               <p>To that end uſe ſeriouſly and daily to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:57538:203"/>
your ſelf, What way of expending your Time and Wealth, and all your Talents, will be moſt comfortable for you to hear of, and review at Judgement? and take that as the way moſt comfortable now. Onely conſult not with fleſh and blood: make not your fleſh of your counſel in this work: but take it for your enemy: expect its violent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied oppoſition: But regard not any of its clamours or repinings: But know, as I ſaid before, that your trueſt ſpiritual comforts are a Prize that muſt be won upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the fleſh. I will only add to this the words of Bleſſed Dr. <hi>Sibs</hi> (a man that was no enemy to Free Grace, nor unjuſt Patron of mans Works) in his Preface to his <hi>Souls Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict; Chriſt is firſt a King of Righteouſneſs, and then of Peace: The Righteouſneſs that he works by his Spirit brings a Peace of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: whereby though we are not freed from ſin, yet we are enabled to combat with it, and to get the victory over it. Some Degree of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort follows every Good Action, as heat accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies fire, and as beams and influences iſſue from the Sun: Which is ſo true, that very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens upon the diſcharge of a good Conſcience, have found Comfort and Peace anſwerable: this is a Reward before our Reward</hi> Again, <hi>In watchfulneſs and diligence we ſooner meet with Comfort then in idle Complaining.</hi> Again,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:57538:203"/>
Pag. 44, 45. <hi>An unimployed life is a burthen to it ſelf. God is a pure act: always Working: always Doing: and the nearer our ſoul comes to God, the more it is in action, and the freer from diſquiet. Men experimentally feel that Comfort in Doing that which belongs unto them, which before they longed for and went with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</hi> And in his Preface to the <hi>Bruiſed Reed; There is no more Comfort to be expected from Chriſt then there is Care to Pleaſe him. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to make him an A better of a lawleſs and a looſe life, is to transform him into a phancy; nay into the likeneſs of him whoſe works he came to deſtroy, which is the moſt deteſtable Idolatry of all. One way whereby the Spirit of Chriſt prevaileth in his, is to preſerve them from ſuch thoughts: Yet we ſee, People will frame a Divinity to themſelves, pleaſing to the fleſh, ſutable to their own ends, which being vain in the ſubſtance, will prove likewiſe vain in the fruit, and a building upon the ſands.</hi> So far Dr. <hi>Sibs.</hi> It ſeems there were Libertines and Antinomians then: and will be as long as there are any carnal unſanctified Profeſſors.</p>

<pb n="347" facs="tcp:57538:204"/>
intending thereby to ſerve God; which though it be not true Righteouſneſs, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Intended for Righteouſneſs, and done as a ſervice of God, or Obedience to him, is here called Over-much-Righteouſneſs. I know it is ſtark madneſs in the prophane ſecure World to think that the doing of no more then God hath commanded us, is Doing too much, or More then needs; as if God had bid us do more then needs, or had made ſuch Laws as few of the fooliſh Rulers on earth would make: This is plainly to Blaſpheme the Moſt High<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by denying his Wiſdom and his Goodneſs, and his Juſt Government of the World: and to Blaſpheme his holy Laws, as if they were too ſtrict, preciſe, and made us more to do then needs: and to reproach his ſweet and holy ways, as if they were grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, intolerable and unneceſſary. Much more is their Madneſs, in charging the Godly with being too Pure, and too Preciſe, and making too great a ſtir for Heaven, and that meerly for their Godlineſs and Obedience, when, alas, the beſt do fall ſo far ſhort of what Gods Word and the neceſſity of their own ſouls do require, that their Conſciences do more grievouſly accuſe them of Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, then the barking World doth of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too preciſe and diligent: And yet more mad are the World, to lay out ſo much Time,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:57538:205"/>
and Care, and Labour for Earthly Vanities, and to provide for their contemptible bodies for a little while, and in the mean time to think that Heaven and their Everlaſting Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs there, and the eſcaping of everlaſting damnation in Hell, are Matters not worth ſo much ado, but may be had with a few cold wiſhes, and that its but folly to do ſo much for it as the Godly do: That no labour ſhould be thought too much for the World, the Fleſh and the Devil, and every little is enough for God. And that theſe wretched ſouls are ſo blinded by their own luſts, and ſo bewitched by the Devil into an utter Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of their own hearts, that they verily think, and will ſtand in it, that for all this They Love God above all, and love Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things better then Earthly, and therefore ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p>But yet Extremes there are in the ſervice of God, which all wiſe Chriſtians muſt labour to avoyd. It is a very great Queſtion among Divines, Whether the common rule in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thicks, <hi>That Virtue is ever in the middle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two extremes,</hi> be ſound, as to Chriſtian Virtues: <hi>Ameſius</hi> ſaith, No. The Caſe is not very hard, I think, to be reſolved, if you will but uſe theſe three Diſtinctions. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Acts of the meer Rational facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Underſtanding and Will, called, Elicite
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:57538:205"/>
Acts; and the Acts of the Inferiour faculties of ſoul and body, called, Imperate Acts. 2. Between the Acts that are About the End immediatly, and thoſe that are About the Means. 3. Between the Intenſion of an Act, and the Objective-Extenſion, and Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Object with Object. And ſo I ſay: 1. The End (that is, God and Salvation) cannot be too fully Known, or too much Loved, with a pure Rational Love of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency, nor too much ſought by the Acts of the ſoul as purely Rational: For the End being loved and ſought for it ſelf, and being of Infinite Goodneſs, muſt be loved and ſought without Meaſure or Limitation, it being Impoſſible here to exceed. <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. The Means, while they are not miſ-appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, but taken as Means, and Materially well underſtood, cannot be too clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, nor too Rightly choſen, nor too Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely proſecuted. <hi>Prop.</hi> 3. It is too poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to miſ-apprehend the Means, and to place them inſtead of the End, and ſo to Over-love them. <hi>Prop.</hi> 4. The Nature of all the Means conſiſteth in a Middle or Mean betwixt two Extreams, materially: both which Extreams are ſin: ſo that it is poſſible to over-do about all the Means, as to the Matter of them, and the Extent of our acts. Though we cannot Love God too
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:57538:206"/>
much, yet it is poſſible to Preach, Hear, Pray, Read, Meditate, Confer of Good too much: For one Duty may ſhut out another; and a greater may be neglected by our over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing in a leſſer: which was the Phariſees ſin in Sabbath-Reſting. 5. If we be never ſo right in the extenſion of our Acts, yet we may go too far in the Intenſion of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Acts or Paſſions of the ſoul, and that both on the Means and End: Though the pure Acts of Knowing or Willing cannot be too great towards God and Salvation, yet the Paſsions and Acts commonly called Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, may. A man may Think on God not onely too much (as to exclude other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary thoughts) but too Intenſly: and Love and Deſire too Paſsionately: For there is a Degree of Thinking or Meditating, and of Paſsionate Love and Deſire, which the brain cannot bear, but it will cauſe Madneſs, and quite overthrow the uſe of Reaſon, by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtretching the organs, or by the extreme tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulency of the agitated ſpirits. Yet I never knew the man, nor ever ſhall do I think, that was ever guilty of one of theſe exceſſes, that is, of Loving or Deſiring God ſo Paſsionately as to diſtract him: But I have often known weak-headed people (that be not able to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their thoughts) and many Melancholy People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Guilty of the other; that is, of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57538:206"/>
thinking too much and too ſeriouſly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſly on Good and Holy things, whereby they have overthrown their Reaſon and been diſtracted. And here I would give all ſuch weak-headed Melancholy perſons this warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That whereas in my Book of Reſt, I ſo much preſs a conſtant courſe of Heavenly Meditation, I do intend it onely for ſound heads, and not for the Melancholy that have weak heads, and are unable to bear it. That may be their ſin, which to others is a very great duty: While they think to do that which they cannot do, they will but diſable them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for that which they can do. I would therefore adviſe thoſe Melancholy perſons whoſe minds are ſo troubled, and heads weakned, that they are in danger of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing their Underſtandings (which uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally begins in multitudes of ſcruples, and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs of mind, and continual fears, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous temptations: where it begins with theſe, diſtraction is at hand, if not prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) that they forbear Meditation, as being no duty to them, though it be to others; and inſtead of it be the more in thoſe duties which they are fit for: eſpecially Conference with Judicious Chriſtians, and Chearful and Thankful acknowledgement of Gods Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.

He got a ſtanding Verdict againſt the perfection and ſufficiency of Scripture (and conſequently againſt Chriſt, his Spirit, his Apoſtles, and the Chriſtian Faith:) That it will not afford us ſo much as a Creed or Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteme of Fundamentals, or Points abſolutely Neceſſary to Salvation and Brotherly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, in fit or tolerable phraſes; but we muſt mend the language at leaſt. 4.

day. He hath made it the great Engine to get <hi>Rome</hi> on his ſide, and to make them the great Dividers of Chriſts Church: He made the Pope and the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> believe, that when they had owned the antient Creed of the Church, they muſt put in as many and more additional Articles of their own, and Anathematize all gainſayers: and theſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions muſt be the peculiar Mark of their Church, as Romiſh: and then all that are not of that Church, that is, that own not thoſe ſuper-added Points, are not of the true Church of Chriſt, if they muſt be Judges. Yea among our ſelves hath the Devil uſed ſucceſsfully this plot: What Confeſſion of the pureſt Church hath not ſome more then is in Scripture? The moſt modeſt muſt mend the phraſe, and ſpeak plainer, and ſomewhat of their own in it; not excepting our own moſt reformed Confeſſion.</p>
               <p>Yea and where Modeſty reſtrains men from putting all ſuch inventions and expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations in their Creed, the Devil perſwades men that they being the Judgements of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reverend Divines (no doubt to be Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced, valued and heard) it is almoſt as much as if it were in the Creed, and therefore who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diſſenteth muſt be noted with a black coal, and you muſt diſgrace him, and avoyd Communion with him as an Heretick. Hence

lately is your Union, Communion and the Churches Peace laid upon certain unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Myſteries about Predeſtination, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and objects of Gods Decrees, the manner of the Spirits ſecreteſt operations on the ſoul, the Nature of the Wils eſſential Liberty, and its power of ſelf-determining the Divine concourſe, determination or predeſtination of mans and all other Creatures actions, &amp;c. that he is ſcarcely to be accounted a fit mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for our fraternal Communion that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from us herein. Had it not been for this one Plot, the Chriſtian Faith had been kept pure; Religion had been one; the Church had been one; and the hearts of Chriſtians had been more one then they are. Had not the Devil turn'd Orthodox, he had not made ſo many true Chriſtians Hereticks, as <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phamus</hi> and <hi>Auſtin</hi> have enrolled in the black Liſt: Had not the Enemy of Truth and Peace got into the Chair, and made ſo pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique an Oration as to inflame the minds of the Lovers of Truth to be over-zealous for it, &amp; to do too much, we might have had Truth and Peace to this day. Yea ſtill, if he ſee any man of Experience and Moderation ſtand up to reduce men to the antient ſimplicity, he preſently ſeems the moſt zealous for Chriſt, and tels the unexperienced Leaders of the flocks, that it is in favour of ſome Hereſy
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:57538:210"/>
that ſuch a man ſpeaks; he is plotting a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Syncretiſm, and attempting the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement of Chriſt and <hi>Belial</hi>; he is tainted with Popery, or Socinianiſm, or Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm, or Calviniſm, or whatſoever may make him odious with thoſe he ſpeaks to. O what the Devil hath got by Over-doing?</p>
               <p>And as this is true in Doctrines, ſo is it in Worſhip, and Diſcipline, and Paſtoral Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Government. When the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent could not get the World to deſpiſe the poor Fiſhermen that publiſhed the Goſpel, (the Devil being Judged, and the World Convinced by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt, the Agent, Advocate and Vicar of Chriſt on earth) he will then be the forwardeſt to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and promote them: And if he cannot make <hi>Conſtantine</hi> a Perſecutor of them, he will perſwade him to raiſe them in worldly glory to the Stars, and make them Lords of <hi>Rome,</hi> and poſſeſs them with Princely Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Revenues. And he hath got as much by over-honouring them, as ever he did by perſecuting and deſpiſing them.

So that though he yet have not what he would have, the old Serpent hath done more as a Reformer by over-doing, then he did in many a year as a Deformer or hinderer of Reformation: Yet if he do but ſee that there is a Soveraign Power that can do him a Miſchief, he is ready to tell them.

Why he hath done as much by it in Worſhip and Diſcipline, as almoſt in any thing: When he cannot have Diſcipline neglected, he is an over-zealous ſpirit in the breaſts of the Clergy; and he perſwades them to appoint men Penance, and Pilgrimages, and to put the necks of Princes under their feet. But if this Tyrannie muſt be abated, he cryes down all Diſcipline, and tels them it is all but Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie and humane Inventions; And this confeſſing ſin to Miniſters for Relief of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; and this open Confeſſing in the Congregation for a due Manifeſtation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and ſatisfaction to the Church, that they may hold Communion with them, it is all but Popery and Prieſtly Domineer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>And in matter of Worſhip, worſt of all: When he could not perſwade the world to perſecute Chriſt, and to refuſe him and his Worſhip, the Serpent will be the moſt zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Worſhipper, and ſaith, as <hi>Herod,</hi> and with the ſame mind, <hi>Come and tell me, that I may worſhip him.</hi> He perſwades men to Do and Over-do: He ſets them on laying out their Revenues in ſumptuous Fabricks, in fighting to be Maſters of the Holy Land and Sepulcher of Chriſt, on going Pilgrimages.

The Devil could not hinder it by fire and ſword; when he ſees that, he will needs turn Reformer as I ſaid before, and he gets the Word, and cryes down Antichriſt, and cryes up Reformation, till he hath done what we ſee!

               <p>By this time I hope you ſee that this way of Over-doing hath another Author then many zealous people do imagine: and that it is the Devils common ſucceſsful trade: ſo that his Agents in State-Aſſemblies are taught his Policy, <hi>When you have no other way of un-doing, let it be by over-doing.</hi> And the ſame way he takes with the ſouls of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons: If he ſee them troubled for ſin, and he cannot keep them from the knowledge of Chriſt and free Grace, he puts the name of [<hi>free Grace and Goſpel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> preaching</hi>] upon An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomian and Libertine errours which ſubvert the very Goſpel and free Grace it ſelf.

And ſuch Writings as lately have been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by ſome Engliſh Popiſh Formaliſts, I have known draw men into this ſnare I would have all ſuch remember, 1. That God is a Spirit, and will be worſhipped in Spirit and in Truth: and ſuch Worſhippers doth he ſeek. 2. That God will have mercy and not ſacrifice; and that the Vitals of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are in a Conſumption when the heat of Zeal is drawn too much to the out-ſide. And that placing moſt in externals is the great character of Hypocriſie, and is that Phariſaical Religion to which the doctrine and practice of the Lord Jeſus was moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite, as any that will read the Goſpel may ſoon ſee. 3. That God hath made our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to be his Servants, and Inſtruments of Righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 13. and helpful and ſerviceable to our ſouls in Well-doing: And therefore it is Diſobedience, it is Injuſtice, it is Cruelty to diſable them, and cauſleſly to vex and torment them, much more to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them. You may ſee by ſick men, by Melancholy men, by Mad men and Children, how unfit that ſoul is to know, or Love, or ſerve God, that hath not a fit body to work in &amp; by.

If he can but get you by exceſſive faſtings, watchings, labours, ſtudies, or other auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, eſpecially ſadneſs and perplexities of mind, to have a ſick body, a crazed brain, or a ſhort life, you will be able to do him but little hurt, and God but little ſervice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the pleaſure that he takes in your own Vexation. Nay he will hope to make a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advantage of your weakneſs, and to keep many a ſoul in the ſnares of ſenſuality, by telling them of your miſeries: and ſaying to them, <hi>Doſt thou not ſee in ſuch a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, what it is to be ſo holy and preciſe? They will all run mad at laſt: If once thou grow ſo ſtrict, and deny thy ſelf thy Pleaſures, and take this preciſe courſe, thou wilt but make thy life a miſery, and never have a merry day again.</hi> Such examples as yours the Devil will make uſe of, that he may terrifie poor ſouls from Godlineſs, and repreſent the word and ways of Chriſt to them in an odious, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing, and diſcouraging ſhape. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs that God who himſelf is ſo Merciful to your Body as well as to your Soul, would have you to be ſo too: He that provideth ſo plentifully for its refreſhment, would not have you refuſe his proviſion. He that ſaith the Righteous man is merciful to his beaſt, no doubt would not have him to be unmerciful to his own body. You are commanded to

Love your Neighbour but as your ſelf: And therefore by cruelty and unmerciful dealing with your <hi>Own</hi> body, you will go about to Juſtifie the like dealing with others. You durſt not deny to feed, to cloath, to comfort and refreſh the poor, leſt Chriſt ſhould ſay, <hi>You did it not to me.</hi> And how ſhould you dare to deny the ſame to your ſelf? How will you anſwer God for the neglect of all that ſervice which you ſhould have done him, and might, if you had not diſabled your bodies and minds? He requireth that you Delight your ſelf in him: And how can you do that when you habituate both mind and body to a ſad, dejected, mournful garb? The ſervice that God requires, is, <hi>To ſerve him with chearfulneſs in the abundance that we poſſeſs,</hi> Deut. 28.47. If you think that I here contradict what I ſaid in the former Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for pinching the fleſh, and denying its deſires, you are miſtaken: I onely ſhew you the danger of the contrary extreme.

The truth is (if you would be reſolved how far you may pleaſe or diſpleaſe the fleſh), The fleſh being ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be our ſervant and Gods ſervant, muſt be uſed as a ſervant: You will give your ſervant food, and raiment, and wholſom lodging, and good uſage, or elſe you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, and he will be unfit to do your work:

Remember therefore, though you muſt ſo far tame your Body as to bring it into ſubjection, that you periſh not by pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering it; yet not ſo far as to bring it to weakneſs, and ſickneſs, and unfitneſs for its duty: Nor yet muſt you dare to conceit that you pleaſe God, or ſatisfie him for your ſin, by ſuch a wronging and hurting your own body. Such Popiſh Religiouſneſs ſhews that men have very low and carnal conceits of God. Was it not a baſe wickedneſs in them that offered their Children in ſacrifice, to think that God would be pleaſed with ſuch cruelty? Yea, were it not to have directed us to Chriſt, he would not have accepted of the blood of buls and goats: It is not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice that he deſires: He never was blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſty, nor took any pleaſure in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſuffering. How can you think then that he will take pleaſure in your conſuming and deſtroying your own bodies? It is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable as to imagine that he delights to have men cut their own throats, or hang themſelves; for pining and conſuming ones ſelf is ſelf-murther as well as that. Yet I know no man ſhould draw back from a

If your ſelves make the ſuffering, how can you with any encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment beg ſtrength of God to bear it? and if you have not ſtrength, what will you do? Nay how can you pray for deliverance from Gods Afflictings, when you make more of your own? And thus I have ſhewed you the danger of Over-doing, and what a hindrance it is to a ſetled Peace, both of Church (State) and Soul; though perhaps it may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn a particular Soul ſo certainly (in moſt parts of it) as doing too little will.</p>

And the Devil would make him believe that there are as many Religions as there be odde Opinions: when, alas, the Chriſtian Religion is one, and but one, conſiſting, for the doctrinals, in thoſe fundamentals contained in our Creed: and mens leſſer erroneous opinions are but the ſcabs that adhere to their Religion:

Onely the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a very Leper, whoſe infectious diſeaſe doth compel us to avoyd her company: (As for any ſort of men that deny the Fundamentals, I will not call them by the name of Chriſtians) So alſo in Duties of Worſhip Satan will be caſting in Scruples.

The like courſe Satan takes with Chriſtians in Reading, Praying in ſecret, or in their families, Teaching their families, Reproving Sinners, Teaching the Ignorant, Meditation, and all other duties, too long to mention the particular ſcruples which he thruſts into mens heads, much more to Reſolve them, which would require a large Volume alone.</p>

<pb n="377" facs="tcp:57538:219"/>
more to queſtion your Juſtification or Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. I have ſaid enough before to prove their doctrine deteſtable. Their reaſon is, Becauſe God changeth not as we change, and Juſtification is never loſt. To which I anſwer, 1. God hated us while we were workers of Iniquity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.5. and was angry with us when we were Children of wrath, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3. And afterward he laid by that Hatred and Wrath: and all this without change. If we cannot reach to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend how Gods unchangeableneſs can ſtand with the fulleſt and frequenteſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of him in Scripture, muſt we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deny what thoſe expreſſions do contain? As <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, Shall we deny that which is plain, becauſe we cannot reach that which is obſcure and difficult? 2. But if theſe men had well ſtudied the Scriptures, they might have known that the ſame man that was yeſterday Hated as an Enemy, may to Day be Reconciled and loved as a Son, and that without any change in God; even as it fals out within the reach of our Knowledge: For God Ruleth the world by his Laws: They are his Moral Inſtruments: By them he Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth: By them he Juſtifieth; ſo far as he is ſaid in this Life, before the Judgement day, to do it (unleſs there be any other ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret act of Juſtification with him, which man
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:57538:220"/>
is not able now to underſtand.) The change is therefore in our Relations, and in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Action of the Laws. When we are Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers and Impenitent, we are Related to God as Enemies, Rebels, Unjuſtified and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned: being ſuch as Gods Law Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth and pronounceth Enemies; and the Law of Grace doth not yet Juſtifie or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: and ſo God is, as it were, in ſome ſenſe obliged according to that Law which we are under, to deal with us as Enemies by deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us: And this is Gods Hating, Wrath, &amp;c. When we Repent, Return and Believe, our Relation is changed: The ſame Law that did Condemn us, is Relaxed and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled, and the Law of Grace doth now Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit us; it Pardoneth us, it Juſtfieth us; and God by it: And ſo God is Reconciled to us, when we are ſuch as according to his own Law of Grace, he is, as it were, Obliged to forgive and to do Good to and to uſe as ſons. Is not all this apparently without any change in God! Cannot he make a Law that ſhall change its Moral Action according to the change of the actions or inclinations of ſinners? and this without any change in God? And ſo, If it ſhould ſo be, that a Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied man ſhould fall from God, from Chriſt, from ſincere Faith or Obedience, the Law would Condemn him again, and the Law of
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:57538:220"/>
Grace would Juſtifie him no more (in that ſtate) and all this without any change in God. 3. If this Antinomian Argument would prove any thing, it would prove Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication before and ſo without Chriſts ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, becauſe there is no change in God. 4. The very point, <hi>That no juſtified man ſhall ever fall from Chriſt,</hi> is not ſo clear and fully revealed in Scripture, and paſt all doubt from the aſſault of Objections, as that a poor ſoul in ſuch a Relapſed eſtate ſhould venture his everlaſting ſalvation wholly on this, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that he were Certain that he was once ſincere. For my own part, I am perſwaded that no Rooted Believer, that is Habitually and Groundedly Reſolved for Chriſt, and hath crucified the fleſh and the world (as all have that are throughly Chriſts) do ever fall quite away from him afterwards. But I dare not lay my ſalvation on this. And, if I were no ſurer of my ſalvation, then I am of the truth of this my Judgement, to ſpeak freely, my ſoul would be in a very ſad Condition. 5. But ſuppoſe it as certain and plain as any word in the Goſpel, (that a Juſtified man is never quite Unjuſtified) Yet as every new ſin brings a new obligation to puniſhment (or elſe they could not be pardoned, as needing no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don) ſo muſt every ſin have its particular pardon, (and conſequently, the ſinner a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:57538:221"/>
Juſtification from the Guilt of that ſin) beſides his firſt general pardon (and Juſtification:) (For to pardon ſin before it is committed, is to pardon ſin that is no ſin, which is a Contradiction, and Impoſſibility.) Now, though for daily unavoydable Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, there be a pardon of Courſe, upon the Title of our Habitual Faith and Repentance; yet whether in caſe of Groſs ſin, or more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Defection, this will prove a ſufficient Title to particular pardon, without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of actual Repentance; and what Caſe the ſinner is in till that actual Repentance and Faith, as I told you before, are ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult queſtions (it being ordered by Gods great wiſdom that they ſhould be ſo) that it beſeems no wiſe man to venture his ſalvation on his own opinion in theſe. Nay it's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that if Groſs ſinners having opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and knowledge of their ſins, Repent not, they ſhall periſh. And therefore I think, a Juſtified man hath great Reaſon upon ſuch fals, to examine his particular Repentance, (as well as his former ſtate) and not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe himſelf, or preſume upon a pardon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. 6. And beſides all this, though both the Continuance of Faith, and non-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of Juſtification be never ſo certain, yet when a mans obedience is ſo far over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, his former Evidences and Perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:57538:221"/>
of his Juſtification will be uncertain to him. Though he have no Reaſon to think that God is changeable, or Juſtification will be loſt, yet he hath Reaſon enough to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whether ever he were a true Believer, and ſo were ever Juſtified. For Faith work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by Love: and they that Love Chriſt will keep his Commandments. Libertines and carnal men may talk their pleaſure: but when Satan maintains not their Peace, ſin will break it: and Dr. <hi>Sibs</hi> words will be found true, <hi>Souls Conflict,</hi> pag. 41, 42. <hi>Though the main pillar of our Comfort be the free for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of our ſins, yet if there be a neglect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But now let me deſire you to peruſe the Direction, and practice it. If when God hath given you Aſſurance, or ſtrong probabilities of your ſincerity, you will make uſe of it but onely for that preſent time, you will never then
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:57538:222"/>
have a ſetled Peace in your ſoul: Beſides, the great wrong you do to God, by neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating him to be ſo often renewing ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, and repeating the ſame words to you ſo often over. If your Child offend you, would you have him when he is pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no longer to believe it then you are tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it him? Should he be ſtill asking you over and over every day, <hi>Father, am I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, or no?</hi> Should not one anſwer ſerve his turn? Will you not believe that your money is in your purſe or cheſt any longer then you are looking on it? Or that your corn is growing on your land, or your cattel in your grounds any longer then you are looking on them? By this Courſe a Rich man ſhould<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have no more content then a beggar, longer then he is looking on his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or goods, or lands: and when he is look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on one, he ſhould again loſe the Comfort of all the reſt. What hath God given you a Memory for, but to lay up former appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, and diſcoveries, and experiences, and make uſe of them on all meet occaſions afterwards? Let me therefore perſwade you to this great and neceſſary work. When God hath once Reſolved your Doubts, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you the truth of your Faith, Love or Obedience, Write it down, if you can, in your book (as I have adviſed you in my
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:57538:222"/>
Treatiſe of <hi>Reſt</hi>) <hi>Such a day upon ſerious peruſal of my heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I found it thus and thus with my ſelf.</hi> Or at leaſt, Write it deep in your Memory; And do not ſuffer any fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or fears, or light ſurmiſes to cauſe you to queſtion this again, as long as you fall not from the Obedience or Faith which you then diſcovered. Alas, mans Apprehenſion is a moſt mutable thing: If you leave your ſoul open to every new apprehenſion, you will never be ſetled: You may think two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary things of your ſelf in an hour. You have not always the ſame opportunity for right diſcerning, nor the ſame clearneſs of Apprehenſion, nor the ſame outward means to help you, nor the ſame inward Aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt: When you have theſe therefore, make uſe of them, and fix your wavering ſoul, and take your Queſtion and Doubt as Reſolved, and do not tempt God, by calling him to new Anſwers again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as if he had given you no anſwer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. You will never want ſome occaſion of Jealouſie and fears as long as you have Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in your heart, and ſin in your life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a Tempter to be troubling you: But if you will ſuffer any ſuch wind to ſhake your Peace and Comforts, you will be always ſhaking, and fluctuating as a wave of the Sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And you muſt labour to apprehend not onely

the Uncomfortableneſs, but the Sinfulneſs alſo of this courſe. For though the queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your own ſincerity on every ſmall occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be not near ſo great a ſin, as the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning of Gods Merciful Nature, or the truth of his Promiſe, or his Readineſs to ſhew Mercy to the Penitent ſoul, or the Freeneſs and Fulneſs of the Covenant of Grace: yet even this is no contemptible ſin.

And in ſearching after ſin it ſelf in your Afflictions, be ſure that you make the Word, and not your ſufferings, the Rule to diſcover how far you have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and let Afflictions onely quicken you
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:57538:226"/>
to try by the Word. How many a Soul have I known that by miſ-interpreting Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, have in a blind Jealouſy been termed quite from Truth and Duty, ſuppoſing it had been errour and ſin? and all becauſe of their Afflictions? As a fooliſh man in his ſickneſs accuſeth the laſt meat that he ate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he fell ſick, though it might be the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt that ever he ate, and the diſeaſe may have many Cauſes which he is Ignorant of.

Another comes and tels the troubled ſoul, <hi>It is Legal Preaching, and looking at ſomething in your ſelf for Peace and Comfort, which hath brought you into this diſtreſs: As long as you follow theſe Legal Preachers, and read their books, and look at any thing in your ſelf, and ſeek Aſſurance from Marks within you, it will never be better with you. Theſe Preachers underſtand not the nature of free Grace, nor ever taſted it themſelves, and therefore they cannot preach it, but deſpiſe it. You muſt know that Grace is ſo free that the Covenant hath no Condition: You muſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and not look after the Marks: and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving is but to be perſwaded that God is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to you, and hath forgiven you: for you are Juſtified before you were born if you are one of the Elect, and can but Believe it; 't is not any thing of your own by which you can be Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified: Nor is it any ſin of yours that can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtifie. It is the witneſs of the Spirit onely perſwading you of your Juſtification and Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that can give you Aſſurance; and fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it from any thing in your ſelf, is but a reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on your own Righteouſneſs, and forſaking Chriſt.</hi> When the Antinomian hath but ſung this Ignorant Charm to a poor Soul as Ignorant as himſelf, and prepared by terrours
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:57538:227"/>
to entertain the Impreſſion, preſently it (oft) takes, and the ſinner without a wonder of Mercy is undone. This Doctrine which ſubverteth the very ſcope of the Goſpel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entertained, ſubverteth his Faith and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; and uſually the Libertiniſm of his opinion is ſeen in his Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Licentious practiſes: and his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of mind is cured, as a burning feaver, by <hi>opium,</hi> which gives him ſuch a ſleep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>that he never awaketh till he be in another world. Yet theſe errours are ſo groſs, and ſo fully againſt the expreſs Texts of Scripture, that if Miniſters would condeſcendingly, lovingly and familiarly deal with them, and do their duty, I ſhould hope many well-meaning Souls might be recovered. Thus you ſee the danger of raſh interpreting, and ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpreting Providences. As ſuch inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of proſperity and ſucceſs deludeth not onely the Mahometan world, and the Prophane world, but many that ſeemed Godly; ſo many ſuch Interpretations of Adverſity and Croſſes do; eſpecially if the Seducer be but kind and liberal to relieve them in their Adverſity he may do with many poor Souls almoſt what he pleaſe.</p>

                  <pb n="394" facs="tcp:57538:228"/>3. The third Enemy to your peace here mentioned, is, <hi>Miſinterpreting or miſapplying the Paſſages of Preachers, in their Sermons, Writings, or private Speeches.</hi> A Miniſter cannot deal throughly or ſeriouſly with any ſort of ſinners, but ſome fearful troubled ſouls apply all to themſelves. I muſt intreat you to avoid this fault, or elſe you will turn Gods Ordinances, and the daily food of your ſouls into bitterneſs and wormwood, and all through your miſtakes. I think there is few Miniſters ſo preach, but you might perceive whom they mean, and they ſo difference as to tell you who they ſpeak to. I confeſs it is a better ſign of an honeſt heart, and ſelf-judging conſcience, to ſay <hi>He ſpeaks now to me: this is my caſe</hi>: then to ſay, <hi>He ſpeaks now to ſuch or ſuch a one: this is their caſe.</hi> For it is the property of Hypocrites to have their eye moſt abroad; and in every duty to be minding moſt the faults of others: and you may much diſcern ſuch in their prayers, in that they will fill their confeſſions moſt with other mens ſins, and you may feel them all the while in the boſom of their neighbours, when you may even feel a ſincere man ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own heart, and moſt opening his own boſom to God. But though ſelf-applying, and ſelf-ſearching be far the better ſign, yet muſt not any wiſe Chriſtian do it miſtakingly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="395" facs="tcp:57538:228"/>
for that may breed abundance of very ſad effects. For beſides the aforeſaid embitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods Ordinances to you, and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging you from them, do but conſider what a grief and a ſnare you may prove to your Miniſter. A grief it muſt needs be to him who knows he ſhould not make ſad the ſoul of the innocent, to think that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avoid it, without avoiding his duty.

it is not onely the loſs of our preaching, but we oft do them much harm: for they are hardened that ſhould be humbled; and they are wounded more that ſhould be healed A Miniſter now muſt needs tell them, who he means by the Believer, and who by the Unbeliever, who by the Righteous, and who by the wicked: and yet when he hath done it as accurately, and as cautelouſly as he can, miſapplying ſouls will wrong themſelves by it: ſo that becauſe people cannot ſee the diſtinguiſhing line, it therefore comes to paſs that few are comforted, but when Miniſters preach nothing elſe but comfort: and few humbled, but where Miniſters bend almoſt all their endeavors that way, that people can feel almoſt nothing elſe from him: But for him that equally would divide to each their portion, each one ſnatcheth up the part of another, and he oft miſſeth of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting either: And yet this is the courſe that we muſt take.</p>

Do you uſe to deal with ſervants

and neighbors about you, and tell them of ſin and miſery, and the remedy, and ſeek to draw their hearts to Chriſt, and bring them to duty? I doubt you do little in this (and that is ſad unmercifulneſs:) for if you did, truly you could not chooſe but finde ſuch miſerable ignorance, ſuch ſenſeleſneſs and blockiſhneſs, ſuch hating reproof and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs to be reformed, ſuch love of this world, and ſlavery to the fleſh, and ſo little ſavour of Chriſt, Grace, Heaven and the things of the Spirit, and eſpecially ſuch an unteachableneſs, intractableneſs (as thorns and bryars) and ſo great a difficulty of moving them an inch from what they are, that you would have been willing ever after to have <hi>Miniſters</hi> preach more rouſingly then they do, and you would be glad for their ſakes when you heard that which might awake them and prick them to the heart. Yea, if you had tried how hard a work it is to bring worldly formal Hypocrites to ſee their Hypocriſie, or to come over to Chriſt from the creature, and to be in good earneſt in the buſineſs of their ſalvation, you would be glad to have Preachers ſearch them to the quick, and ranſack their hearts, and help them againſt their affected and obſtinate ſelf-deluſions.</p>

Do theſe men think that it is no preaching Chriſt (when we have firſt many years told men the fulneſs of his ſatisfaction, the freeneſs and general extent of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or Promiſe, and the riches of his Grace, and the incomprehenſibleneſs of his Glory, and the Truth of all) to tell them afterwards the danger of refuſing, neglecting, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying him? and of living after the fleſh, and preferring the world before him? and ſerving Mammon, and falling off in perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and avoiding the croſs, and yielding in Temptation, and quenching the Spirit, and declining from their firſt Love, and not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving their Talents, and not forgiving and loving their brethren, yea and enemies? &amp;c.

Blame me not, Reader, if I be zealous againſt theſe men, that not only know no better what preaching Chriſt is, but in their ignorance reproach their Brethren for not preaching Chriſt, and withal condemn Chriſt himſelf, and all his Apoſtles?

When we finde men ſettled under the preaching of free Grace, in a baſe contempt or ſleepy neglect of it, preferring the world and their carnal pleaſures and eaſe before all the Glory of heaven, and Riches of Chriſt and Grace, is it not time for us to ſay, <hi>How ſhall ye eſcape, if ye neglect ſo great ſalvation?</hi> Heb. 2.3. <hi>and of how much ſoarer puniſhment ſhall he be thought worthy that treads under foot the blood of the Covenant?</hi> Heb. 10.26 when men grow careleſs and unbelieving, muſt we not ſay, <hi>Take heed leſt a promiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſt of entring into his Reſt, any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it?</hi> Heb. 4.1. 3.

                     <head>ANSWER.</head>
                     <p>I will lay down the full anſwer to this in theſe Propoſitions. 1. It is true that Grace is not Natural to us, or conveyed by Generation. 2. Yet it is as true that Grace is given to our Children as well as to us. That it may be ſo, and is ſo with ſome, all will grant who believe that Infants may be, and are ſaved: And that it is ſo with the Infants of Believers, I have fully proved in my Book of Baptiſm: But mark what Grace I mean: The Grace of Remiſſion of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin the Children of all true Believers have at leaſt a high probability of, if not a full Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty; their parent Accepting it for himſelf and them, and Dedicating them to Chriſt, and engaging them in his Covenant, ſo that he takes them for his People, and they take him for their Lord and Saviour. And for the Grace of inward Renewing of their Natures or Diſpoſitions, it is a ſecret to us, utterly unknown whether God uſe to do it in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants or no. 3. Gods firſt-ordained way for the working of inward holineſs is by Parents Education of their Children, and not by the publick Miniſtry of the Word: of which more anon. 4. All godly Parents do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:57538:235"/>
their Children with the doctrine of Chriſt in their Infancy, as ſoon as they are capable of receiving it, and do afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate it on them more and more. 5. Theſe Inſtructions of Parents are uſually ſeconded by the workings of the Spirit according to the capacity of the Child, opening their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings to receive it, and making an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion thereby upon the heart. 6. When theſe Inſtructions and the inward workings of the Spirit are juſt paſt the preparatory part, and above the higheſt ſtep of Common Grace, and have attained to ſpecial ſaving Grace, is ordinarily undiſcernible: &amp; therefore as I have ſhewed already, in Gods uſual way of working Grace, men cannot know the juſt day or time when they began to be in the ſtate of Grace. And though men that have long lived in Prophaneſs, and are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſuddenly, may conjecture near at the time: yet thoſe that God hath been work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on early in their youth, yea or after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by ſlow degrees, cannot know the time of their firſt receiving the Spirit. 8. The Memories of all men are ſo ſlippery and one thought ſo ſuddenly thruſt out by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, that many a thouſand ſouls forget thoſe particular workings which they have truly felt. 9. The Memories of Children are far weaker then of others: and therefore
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:57538:235"/>
it is leſs probable that all the Spirits workings ſhould by them be remembred. 9. And the motions of Grace are ſo various, ſometimes ſtirring one Affection, and ſometimes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; ſometimes beginning with ſmaller motions, and then moving more ſtrongly and ſenſibly, that its uſual for later motions which are more deeply affecting, to make us over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look all the former, or take them for nothing. 10. God dealeth very variouſly with his Choſen in their Converſion, as to the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentals and circumſtances of the work. Some he calleth not home till they have run a long race in the way of Rebellion, in open drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, ſwearing, worldlineſs, and deriſion of holineſs: Theſe he uſually humbleth more deeply, and they can better obſerve the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſteps of the Spirit in the work; (and yet not always neither) Others he ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth in their youth, that though they have not ſaving Grace, yet they are not guilty of any Groſs ſins, but have a liking to the people and ways of God: and yet he doth not ſavingly convert them till long after. It is much harder for theſe to diſcern the time or manner of their Converſion: yet uſually ſome conjectures they may make: And uſually their humiliation is not ſo deep. Others, as is ſaid, have the ſaving workings of the Spirit in their very Childhood, and
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:57538:236"/>
theſe can leaſt of all diſcern the certain time or order. The ordinary way of Gods deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with thoſe that are Children of Godly Parents, and have good Education, is, by giving them ſome liking of Godly perſons and ways, ſome Conſcience of ſin, ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and recourſe by prayer to God in Chriſt for mercy; yet youthful luſts and folly, and ill company, do uſually much ſtifle it; till at laſt by ſome Affliction, or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or Book, or good Company, God ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth home the work, and maketh them more Reſolute and victorious Chriſtians. Theſe perſons now can remember that they had convictions and ſtirrings of Conſcience when they were young, and the other fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned works: perhaps they can remember ſome more notable rowſings and awakenings long after, and perhaps they have had many ſuch fits and ſteps, and the work hath ſtood at this paſs for a long time, even many years together. But at which of all theſe Changes it was that the Soul began to be ſavingly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, I think is next to an impoſſibility to diſcern. According to that experience which I have had of the ſtate of Chriſtians, I am forced to Judge that moſt of the Children of the Godly that ever are Renewed, are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in their Childhood, or much towards it then done, and that among forty Chriſtians
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:57538:236"/>
there is not one that can certainly name the month in which his ſoul firſt began to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere; and among a thouſand Chriſtians, I think not one can name the hour. The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon which awakened them they may name, but not the hour when they firſt arrived at a ſaving ſincerity.</p>
                     <p>My advice therefore to all Chriſtians is this; <hi>Find Chriſt by his Spirit dwelling in your hearts, and then never trouble your ſelves, though you know not the time or manner of his entrance.</hi> Do you value Chriſt above the world? and Reſolve to chooſe him before the world? and perform theſe Reſolutions? Then need you not doubt but the Spirit of Jeſus is victorious in you.</p>

If God prevented thoſe hainous ſins in the time of your unregeneracy, which thoſe uſually are guilty of who are called to ſo deep a degree of ſorrow, you ſhould rather be thankful that your wound was not deeper, then troubled that the Cure coſt you not dearer. Look well whether the Cure be wrought in the change of your heart and life from the world to God by Chriſt, and then you need not be troubled that it was wrought ſo eaſily. 4. Were you not acquainted with the evil of ſin, and danger and miſery of

There is a great deal of difference betwixt the Converſion of a Jew or any other Infidel, who is brought on the ſudden to know the doctrine of Sin, Miſery, and Salvation by Chriſt; and the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Profeſſour of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T it is common with all the world to conſent to the Religion that they are bred up in, and ſomewhat affected with it, and to make Conſcience of obeying the precepts of it: ſo do the Jews in theirs: the Mahometans in theirs: And I fear it is no other work on my ſoul but the meer force of Education, that maketh me Religious, and that I had never that great Renewing work of the Spirit upon my ſoul; and ſo that all my Religion is but meer Opinion, or Notions in my Brain.</p>
                  <div type="answer">
                     <head>ANSWER.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. ALL the Religions in the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Chriſtian Religion, have either much errour and wickedneſs mixt with ſome Truth of God, or they contain ſome leſſer parcel of that Truth alone (as the Jews) Onely the Chriſtian Religion hath that whole Truth which is ſaving. Now ſo much of Gods Truth as there is in any of theſe Religions, ſo much it may work Good effects upon their ſouls; as the knowledge of the Godhead, and that God is Holy, Good, Juſt, Merciful, and that he ſheweth them much undeſerved Mercy in his daily
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:57538:240"/>
providences, &amp;c. But mark theſe two things, 1. That all perſons of falſe Religions do more eaſily and greedily embrace the falſe part of their Religion then the true; and thoſe they are zealous for, and practice with all their might, becauſe their natural cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption doth befriend it, and is as combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fewel for the fire of Hell to catch in: but that Truth of God which is mixt with their Error, if it be practical, they fight againſt it, and abhor it while they hold it, becauſe it croſſeth their luſts: inſomuch that it is uſually but ſome few of the more convinced and civil that God in providence maketh the main Inſtruments of continuing thoſe Truths of his in that part of the wicked world: For we finde that even among Pagans the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaner and more ſenſual ſort did deride the better ſort, as our prophane Chriſtians do the godly whom they called Puritans. 2. Note, that the Truth of God which in theſe falſe Religions is ſtill acknowledged, is ſo ſmall a part and ſo oppreſſed by Errors, that it is not ſufficient to their ſalvation (that is, to give them any ſound Hope) nor is it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make ſuch clear and deep and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Impreſſions in their mindes as may make them Holy or truly Heavenly, or may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in them the Intereſt of the world and the fleſh.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="419" facs="tcp:57538:240"/>This being ſo, you may ſee great reaſon, why a Turk or a Heathen may be zealous for his Religion without Gods Spirit, or any true Sanctification, when yet you cannot be ſo truly zealous for yours without it. Indeed the ſpeculative part of our Religion, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Practical, or from the hard and ſelf denying part of the Practical, many a wicked man may be zealous for: as to maintain the Godhead, or that God is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, &amp;c. or to maintain againſt the Jews that Jeſus is the Chriſt, or againſt the Turks that he is the only Redeemer and Teacher of the Church, or againſt the Papiſts that all the Chriſtians in the world are Chriſts Church as well as the Romans; and againſt the Socinians and Arrians, that Chriſt is God, &amp;c. But this is but a ſmal part of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: nor doth this, or any heatheniſh Zeal, ſanctifie the heart, or truly mortifie the fleſh, or overcome the world. They may contemn Life and caſt it away for their Pride and Vain-glory: but not for the hopes of a holy and bleſſed Life with God. This is but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of one corruption againſt another, or rather of vice againſt nature. There is a common Grace of God that goeth along with common Truths, and according to the meaſure of their obedience to the Truth, ſuch was the change it wrought; which was
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:57538:241"/>
done by common Truths, and common Grace together, but not by their falſe mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures at all. But God hath annexed his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace only to the ſpecial Truths of the Goſpel or Chriſtian-Religion. If therefore God do by common Grace work a great change on a Heathen by the means of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Truths, and do by his ſpecial Grace work a greater and ſpecial change on you, by the means of the ſpecial truths of the Goſpel, have you any reaſon hereupon to ſuſpect your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? or ſhould you not rather both admire that providence and common Grace which is manifeſted without the Church, and humbly, rejoycingly and thankfully embrace that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſaving Grace which is manifeſted to your ſelf above them?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And for that which you ſpeak of <hi>Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> you have as much cauſe to doubt of your converſion, becauſe it was wrought by publike preaching, as becauſe it was wrought by Education. For 1. Both are by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: For it is the Goſpel that your Parents taught you, as well as which the Preacher teacheth you. 2 I have ſhewed you, that if Parents did not ſhamefully neglect their duties, the Word Publikely preached would not be the ordinary inſtrument of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Children of true Chriſtians, but would onely build them up, and direct them
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:57538:241"/>
in the faith, and in obedience. The proof is very plain: If we ſhould ſpeak nothing of the Intereſt of our Infants in the Covenant-Grace upon the Conditional force of their Parents faith, nor of their Baptiſm: yet <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. &amp; <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. and oft in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> you may finde that it is Gods ſtrict Command that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſhould teach Gods word to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and bring them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord; yea with a predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or half promiſe, that if we train up a childe in the way he ſhould go, when he is old he ſhall not depart from it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.6. Now its certain that God will uſually bleſs that which he appointeth to be the uſual means, if it be rightly uſed: For he hath appointed no means to be uſed in vain.</p>
                     <p>I hope therefore by this time you ſee, that inſtead of being troubled that the work was done on your ſoul by the means of Education, 1. You had more Reaſon to be troubled if it had been done firſt by the publike Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word: For it ſhould grieve you at the heart to think, 1. That you lived in an unregenerate ſtate ſo long, and ſpent your childehood in vanity and ſin, and thought not ſeriouſly on God and your ſalvation, for ſo many years together. 2. And that you or your Parents ſin ſhould provoke God ſo long to withdraw his Spirit &amp; deny you his Grace.
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:57538:242"/>
2. You may ſee alſo what unconceiveable thanks you owe to God, who made Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the means of your early change. 1. In that he prevented ſo many and grievous ſins which elſe you would have been guilty of (And you may read in <hi>Davids</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes</hi> caſe, that even pardoned ſins have oft-times very ſad effects left behinde them.) 2. That you have enjoyed Gods Spirit and Love ſo much longer then elſe you would have done. 3. That iniquity took not ſo deep rooting in you, as by cuſtom it would have done. 4. That the Devil cannot Glory of that ſervice which you did him, as elſe he might: and that the Church is not ſo much the worſe, as elſe it might have been by the miſchief you would have done; and that you need not all your days look back with ſo much trouble, as elſe you muſt, upon the effects of your ill doing; nor with <hi>Paul,</hi> to think of one <hi>Stephen,</hi> yea many Saints in whoſe blood you firſt embrued your hands, and to cry out, <hi>I was born out of due time: I am not worthy to be called a Chriſtian, becauſe I perſecuted the Church of God: I was mad againſt them, and perſecuted them into ſeveral Cities: I was ſometime fooliſh, diſobedient, ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures.</hi> Would you rather that God had permitted you to do this? 5. And me thinks it ſhould be a comfort to you, that your own
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:57538:242"/>
Father was the Inſtrument of your ſpiritual Good: that he that was the means of your Generation, was the means of your Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: both becauſe it will be a double comfort to your Parents, and becauſe it will endear and engage you to them in a double bond. For my part, I know not what God did ſecretly in my heart before I had the uſe of memory and reaſon, but the firſt good that ever I felt on my ſoul, was from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and teachings of my own father in my childehood; and I take it now for a double mercy, being gladder that he was the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to do me Good, then if it had been the beſt Preacher in the world: How foul an overſight is it then, that you ſhould be troubled at one of the choiceſt mercies of your life, yea that your life was capable of, and for which you owe to God ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant thanks!</p>

                     <p n="1">1. A Soft heart conſiſteth in two things, 1. That the Will be perſwadable, tractable and yielding to God, and plyable to his will: 2. That the Affections or Paſſions be ſomewhat moved herewithal about ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things. Some degree more or leſs of the latter, doth concur with the former; but I have told you that it is the former wherein the heart and life of Grace doth lie and that the latter is very various, and uncertain to try
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:57538:243"/>
by. Many do much overlook the Scripture-meaning of the word <hi>Hard-heartedneſs.</hi> Mark it up and down concerning the Iſraelites who are ſo oft charged by <hi>Moſes, David, Iſaiah, Jeremiah,</hi> and other Prophets, to be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, or to harden their hearts, or ſtiffen their necks; and you will finde that the moſt uſual meaning of the Holy Ghoſt is this; They were an intractable, diſobedient, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate people: or as the Greek word in the New Teſtament ſignifieth, which we often tranſlate <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelieving,</hi> they were an <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſwadable</hi> people: no ſaying would ſerve them. They ſet light by Gods Commands, Promiſes, and ſevereſt Threatnings, and Judgements themſelves: nothing would move them to forſake their ſins and obey the voyce of God. You ſhall finde that hardneſs of heart is ſeldom put for want of tears, or a melting weeping diſpoſition; and never at all for the want of ſuch tears, where the will is tractable and obedient. I pray you exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine your ſelf then according to this Rule. God offereth his Love in Chriſt, and Chriſt with all his benefits to you: Are you willing to Accept them? He commandeth you to worſhip him, and uſe his ordinances, and Love his people, and others, and to forſake your known Iniquities, ſo far that they may not have dominion over you: Are you Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:57538:244"/>
to this? He commandeth you to take him for your God, and Chriſt for your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and ſtick to him for better and worſe, and never forſake him. Are you willing to do this? If you have a ſtiff Rebellious heart, and will not Accept of Chriſt and Grace, and will rather let go Chriſt then the world, and will not be perſwaded from your known iniquities, but are loth to leave them, and love not to be reformed, and will not ſet upon thoſe duties, as you are able, which God requireth, and you are fully convinced of, then are you Hard-hearted in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſenſe. But if you are glad to have Chriſt with all your heart upon the terms that he is offered to you in the Goſpel, and you do walk-daily in the way of duty as you can, and are willing to Pray, and willing to hear and wait on God in his Ordinances, and willing to have all Gods Graces formed within you, and willing to let go your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitableſt and ſweeteſt ſins, and it is your daily deſires, O that I could ſeek God, and do his will more faithfully, zealouſly and pleaſingly then I do! O that I were rid of this body of ſin! theſe carnal, corrupt and worldly inclinations, and that I were as holy as the beſt of Gods Saints on earth! And if when it comes to practiſe, whether you ſhould obey or no, though ſome unwillingneſs to duty and
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:57538:244"/>
willingneſs to ſin be in you, you are offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at it, and the greater bent of your Will is for God, and it is but the leſſer which is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſin, and therefore the world and fleſh do not lead you captive, and you live not wilfully in avoidable ſins, nor at all in groſs ſin: I ſay, if it be thus with you, then you have the Bleſſing of a ſoft heart, a heart of fleſh, a new heart; for it is a Willing obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient tractable heart, oppoſed to obſtinacy in ſin, which Scripture calleth a ſoft heart. And then for the Paſſionate part, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in lively feelings of ſin, miſery, mercy, &amp;c. and in weeping for ſin, I ſhall ſay but this; 1. Many an unſanctified perſon hath very much of it, which yet are deſperately Hard-hearted ſinners. It dependeth far more on the temper of the body, then of the Grace in the ſoul: Women uſually can weep eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (and yet not all) and children, and old men. Some complexions encline to it, and others not: Many can weep at a Paſſion-Sermon, or any moving duty, and yet will not be perſwaded to obedience: theſe are hard-hearted ſinners for all their tears. 2. Many a tender godly perſon cannot weep for ſin; partly through the temper of their minds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which are more judicious and ſolid, and leſs paſſionate, but moſtly from the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of their bodies, which diſpoſe them not
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:57538:245"/>
that way. 3. Deepeſt ſorrows ſeldom cauſe tears, but deep thoughts of heart: as great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt joys ſeldom cauſe laughter, but inward pleaſure. I'le tell you how you ſhall know whoſe heart is truly ſorrowful for ſin and tender: He that would be at the greateſt coſt or pains to be rid of ſin, or that he had not ſinned. You cannot weep for ſin: but you would give all that you have to be rid of ſin; you could wiſh when you diſhonoured God by ſin, that you had ſpent that time in ſuffering rather; and if it were to do again on the ſame terms and inducements, you would not do it: Nay, you would live a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar condtendedly, ſo you might fully pleaſe God, and never ſin againſt him, and are content to pinch your fleſh and deny your worldly intereſt for the time to come, rather then wilfully diſobey. This is a truly tender heart. On the other ſide, another can weep to think of his ſin; and yet if you ſhould ask him, what wouldſt thou give, or what wouldſt thou ſuffer, ſo thou hadſt not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? or that thou mighteſt ſin no more? Alas, very little: For the next time that he is put to it, he will rather venture on the ſin, then venture on a little loſs, or danger, or diſgrace in the world, or deny his craving fleſh its pleaſures. This is a hard-hearted ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The more you would part with to be
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:57538:245"/>
rid of ſin, or the greater coſt you would be at for that end, the more Repentance have you, and true tenderneſs of heart. Alas, if men ſhould go to Heaven according to their weeping, what abundance of children and women would be there for one man! I'le ſpeak truly my own Caſe. This doubt lay heavy many a year on my own ſoul: when yet I would have given all that I had to be rid of ſin; but I could not weep a tear for it. Nor could I weep for the death of my deareſt friends, when yet I would have bought their lives, had it been Gods will, at a dearer rate then many that could weep for them ten times as much. And now ſince my nature is decayed, and my body languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in conſuming weakneſs, and my head more moiſtned, and my veins filled with flegmatick watry blood, now I can weep: and yet I find never the more tender-hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in my ſelf then before. And yet to this day ſo much remains of my old diſpoſition, that I could wring all the money out of my purſe eaſier then one tear out of my eyes, to ſave a friend, or reſcue them from evil: when I ſee divers that can weep for a dead friend, that would have been at no great coſt to ſave their lives. 5. Beſides, as Dr. <hi>Sibs</hi> ſaith, There is oft ſorrow for ſin in us, when
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:57538:246"/>
it doth not appear: It wanteth but ſome quickening word to ſet it afoot. It is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Grief to break out into tears moſt, when ſorrow hath ſome vent, either when we uſe ſome expoſtulating aggravating terms with our ſelves, or when we are opening our hearts and caſe to a friend: then ſorrow will often ſhew it ſelf, that did not before. 6. Yet do I not deny but that our want of Tears and tender Affections and heart-meltings, are our ſins: For my part, I ſee exceeding Cauſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail it greatly in my ſelf, that my ſoul is not raiſed to a higher pitch of tender ſenſibility of all ſpiritual things, then it is: and I doubt not but it ſhould be the matter of our daily confeſſion and complaint to God, that our hearts are ſo dull and little affected with his ſacred Truths, and our own ſins: But this is the ſcope of all my Speech, Why do not you diſtinguiſh between. Matter of Sorrow and Matter of Doubting? No queſtion but you ſhould lament your dulneſs and ſtupidity, and uſe all Gods means for the quickening of your Affections, and to get the moſt lively frame of ſoul: but muſt it cauſe you to doubt of your ſincerity when you cannot obtain this? Then will you never have a ſetled Peace or Aſſurance for many days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, for ought I know. I would ask you but this: Whether you are willing or unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:57538:246"/>
of all that hardneſs, inſenſibleneſs, and dulneſs which you complain of? If you are willing of it, what makes you complain of it? If you are unwilling, it ſeems your will is ſo far ſound; and it is the Will that is the ſeat of the Life of Grace which we muſt try by: And was not <hi>Pauls</hi> Caſe the ſame with yours? <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.19. when he ſaith, <hi>The Good which I Would do, I do not?</hi> and; <hi>When I Would do Good, Evil is preſent with me.</hi> I know <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks not of groſs ſins, but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Infirmities: and I have told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the Livelineſs and Senſibility of the Paſſions or Affections, is a thing that the Will, though ſanctified, cannot fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or excite at its pleaſure. A ſanctified man cannot Grieve or Weep for ſin when he will, or ſo much as he will: he cannot Love, Joy, be Zealous, &amp;c. when he will: He may be truly Willing, and not Able: And is not this your Caſe? And doth not <hi>Paul</hi> make it the Caſe of all Chriſtians? <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>The fleſh luſteth, againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fleſh, and theſe are contrary one to the other, ſo that we cannot do the things that we would.</hi> Take my Counſel therefore in this, if you love not ſelf-deceiving and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs. Search whether you can ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly, <hi>I would with all my heart have Chriſt and his quickening and ſantifying Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:57538:247"/>
and his ſoftning Grace, to bring my hard heart to Tenderneſs, and my dull and blockiſh ſoul to a lively frame! O that I could attain it</hi>! And if you can truly ſay thus, Bleſs God that hath given you ſaving ſincerity: And then let all the reſt of your Dulneſs, and Deadneſs, and Hard-heartedneſs be matter of daily ſorrow to you, and ſpare not, ſo it be in Moderation, but let it be no matter of Doubting. Confeſs it, complain of it, pray againſt it, and ſtrive againſt it: but do not deny Gods Graces in you for it.</p>
                     <p>And here let me mind you of one thing; That it is a very ill diſtemper of ſpirit when a man can mourn for nothing, but what Cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to Doubt of his ſalvation: It is a great Corruption, if when your Doubts are Reſolved, and you are perſwaded of your ſalvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if then you ceaſe all your humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſorrow for your ſin: For you muſt ſorrow that you have in you ſuch a body of Death, and that which is ſo diſpleaſing to God, and are able to pleaſe and enjoy him no more, though you were never ſo Certain of the pardon of ſin and of ſalvation.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Laſtly, let me ask you one Queſtion more: What is the reaſon that you are ſo troubled for want of Tears for your ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Take heed leſt there lie ſome Corruption in this trouble that you do not diſcern. If it
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:57538:247"/>
be onely becauſe your deadneſs and dulneſs is your ſin, and you would fain have your ſoul in that frame, in which it may be fitteſt to pleaſe God and enjoy him: then I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend and encourage you in your trouble. But take heed leſt you ſhould have any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of a Meritoriouſneſs in your Tears; for that would be a more dangerous ſin then your want of Tears. And if it be for want of a ſign of Grace, and becauſe a dry eye is a ſign of an unregenerate ſoul; I have told you, It is not ſo, except where it onely ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds an impenitent heart, and comes from, or accompanieth and unrenewed Will, and a prevailing unwillingneſs to turn to God by Chriſt. Shew me, if you can, where the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſaith, He that cannot Weep for ſin, ſhall not be Saved, or hath no true Grace? Is not your complaint in this the very ſame that the eminenteſt Chriſtians have uſed in all times?

                  <p>O But I am not willing to Good; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I fear that even my will it ſelf is yet unchanged: I have ſuch a backwardneſs and undiſpoſedneſs to Duty, eſpecially ſecret Prayer, Meditation, and ſelf-examination, and reproving and exhorting ſinners, that I am fain to force my ſelf to it againſt my will. It is no Delight the find in theſe Duties that brings me to them, but onely I uſe violence with my ſelf, and am fain to pull my ſelf down on my knees, becauſe I know it is a Duty, and I cannot be ſaved without it: but I am no ſooner on my knees, but I have a motion to riſe, or be ſhort, and am weary of it, and find no great miſs of duty when I do omit it.</p>
                  <div type="answer">
                     <head>ANSWER.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. THis ſhews that your ſoul is ſick when your meat goes ſo much againſt your ſtomack that you are fain to force it down: And ſickneſs may well cauſe you to complain to God and man. But what's this to Dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! The Dead cannot force down their meat, nor digeſt it at all. It ſeems by this
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:57538:248"/>
that you are ſanctified but in a low Degree, and your Corruption remains in ſome ſtrength; and let that be your ſorrow, and the overcoming of it be your greateſt care and buſineſs: But ſhould you therefore ſay that you are unſanctified? It ſeems that you have ſtill the fleſh luſting againſt the ſpirit, that you cannot do the Good you would: when you would pray with Delight and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weariedneſs, the fleſh draws back, and the Devil is hindering you. And is it not ſo in too great a meaſure with the beſt on earth? Remember what Chriſt ſaid to his own Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, when they ſhould have done him one of their laſt Services, as to the attendance of his body on earth, and ſhould have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted him in his Agony, they are all aſleep: Again and again he comes to them, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them aſleep: Chriſt is Praying and ſweating blood, and they are ſtill ſleeping, though he warned them to watch and Pray that they enter not into Temptation. But what doth God ſay to them for it? Why he uſeth this ſame Diſtinction between Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation for ſin, and Doubting of ſincerity and ſalvation, and he helps them to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and helps them againſt the latter; <hi>Could ye not watch with me one hour</hi>? ſaith he. There he convinceth them of the ſin, that they may be humbled for it. <hi>The ſpirit indeed is willing,
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:57538:249"/>
but the fleſh is weak,</hi> ſaith he. There he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly reſiſteth their Doubtings, or prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them; ſhewing them wherein ſincere Grace conſiſteth, even in the ſpirits willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and telling them that they had that Grace; and then telling them whence came their ſin, even from the weakneſs of the fleſh.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I have ſhewed you, that as every mans Will is but partly ſanctified (as to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of holineſs) and ſo far as it is imperfect, it will be unwilling; ſo that there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Duties of ſecret Prayer, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Reproof, which makes moſt men more backward to them then other duties. The laſt doth ſo croſs our fleſhly Intereſts; and the two former are ſo ſpiritual, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſo pure and ſpiritual a ſoul, and ſet a man ſo immediatly before the living God, as if we were ſpeaking to him face to face, and have nothing of external pomp to draw us, that it is no wonder, if while there is fleſh within us, we are backward to them! eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally while we are ſo unacquainted with God, and while ſtrangeneſs and conſciouſneſs of ſin doth make us draw back: Beſides that the Devil will more buſily hinder us here then anywhere.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Queſtion therefore is not whether you have an unwillingneſs &amp; backwardneſs to
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:57538:249"/>
Good? for ſo have all: Nor yet whether you have any cold uneffect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> whether your Willingneſs be not more then your unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs? And in that, 1. It muſt not be in every ſingle act of duty; for a godly man may be actually more unwilling to a duty at this particular time, then willing; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon may omit it: but it muſt be about your Habitual Willingneſs, manifeſted in ordinary actual Willingneſs. 2. You muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any of thoſe Motives which God hath given you to make you willing to Duty: He hath Commanded it; and his Authority ſhould move you: He hath Threatned you; and therefore Fear ſhould move you: Or elſe he would never have Threatned. He hath made Promiſes of Reward, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Hope of that ſhould move. And therefore you may perceive here what a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous miſtake it is to think that we have no Grace, except our Willingneſs to Duty be without Gods Motives, from a meer Love to the Duty it ſelf, or to its effect. Nay, it is a dangerous Antinomian miſtake to imagine that it is our duty to be Willing to Good without theſe Motives of God; I ſay, To take it ſo much as for our Duty to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Gods Motives, though we ſhould not judge of our Grace by it. For it is but an
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:57538:250"/>
Accuſation of Chriſt (and his Law) who hath ordained theſe Motives of Puniſhment and Reward, to be his Inſtruments to move the ſoul to duty. Let me therefore put the right Queſtion to you; <hi>Whether all Gods Motives laid together and conſidered, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary prevailing part of your Will be not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Duty then againſt it?</hi> This you will know by your practice. For if the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part be againſt Duty, you will not do it: If it be for Duty, you will ordinarily perform it, though you cannot do it ſo well as you would. And then you may ſee that your backwardneſs and remaining unwillingneſs muſt ſtill be matter of Humiliation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to you, but not matter of Doubting. Nay thank God that enableth you to pull down your ſelf on your knees when you are unwilling: For what is that but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing of your willingneſs againſt your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs? Should your unwillingneſs once prevail, you would turn your back upon the moſt acknowledged Duties.</p>

                  <div type="answer">
                     <head>ANSWER.</head>
                     <p>I Have anſwered this already. Love will not be perfect in this life. In the life to come it will caſt out all fear of damnation: and all fear that drives the ſoul from God, and all fear of men (which is meant in <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. where the fearful and unbelievers are condemned; that is, thoſe that fear men more then God) And that 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.17, 18. ſpeaketh of a Tormenting Fear, which is it that I am perſwading you from, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in Terrors of ſoul upon an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that God will condemn you; But it ſpeaketh not of a filial fear, nor of a fear leſt we ſhould by forſaking God, or by yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Temptation, loſe the Crown of Life, and ſo periſh: as long as this is not a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:57538:251"/>
fear, but a cautelous, preſerving, preventing fear. Beſides the Text plainly ſaith, <hi>It is that we may have boldneſs in the day of judgement, that Love caſteth out this fear</hi>: And at that day of Judgement, Love will have more fully overcome it. It is a great miſtake to think that Filial Fear is onely the fear of temporal chaſtiſement, and that all fear of Hell is ſlaviſh. Even Filial Fear is a Fear of Hell: But with this difference. A ſon (if he know himſelf to be a Son) hath ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of his Fathers Love to him, that he knows he will not caſt him off, except he ſhould be ſo vile as to renounce his Father; which he is moderately fearful or careful leſt by Temptation he ſhould be drawn to do, but not diſtruſtfully fearful, as knowing the helps and mercies of his Father. But a ſlaviſh Fear is, when a man having no apprehenſions of Gods love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or willingneſs to ſhew him mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, doth look that God ſhould deal with him as a ſlave, and deſtroy him when ever he doth amiſs. It is this ſlaviſh Tormenting fear which I ſpend all this writing againſt. But yet a great deal even of this ſlaviſh fear may be in thoſe ſons, that know not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſons.</p>
                     <p>But ſuppoſe you were out of all fear of Damnation! do not belye your own heart, and tell me, Had you not rather be Holy
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:57538:251"/>
then Unholy? pleaſing to God, then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing? and would not the Hope of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation draw you from ſin to duty, without the fear of Damnation in Hell? But you will ſay, That is ſtill Mercenary, and as bad as ſlaviſh fears. I anſwer, Not ſo, This Hope of Salvation, is the Hope of enjoying God, and living in perfect Pleaſingneſs to him, and pleaſure in him in Glory; And the Deſire of this is a Deſire of Love: It is Love to God that makes you Deſire him, and Hope to enjoy him.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly I ſay again, Take heed of ſeparating what God hath joyned. If God, by putting in your nature the ſeveral Paſſions of Hope, Fear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Love &amp;c. and by putting a Holineſs into theſe Paſſions, by ſanctifying Grace, and by putting both Promiſes and dreadful Threatnings into his word; I ſay, if God by all theſe means hath given you ſeveral motives to obedience, take heed of ſeparating them: Do not once ask your heart ſuch a queſtion, Whether it would obey if there were no Threatning, and ſ no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ear. Nor on the otherſide, do not let Fear do all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Love. Doubtleſs the more Love con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth to duty, the better it is: and you ſhould endeavour with all your might that you might feel more of the force of Love in your duties: But do you not mark how you
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:57538:252"/>
cheriſh that Corruption that you complain of? Your Doubts and Tormenting Fears are the things that Love ſhould caſt out. Why then do you entertain them? If you ſay, I cannot help it: why then do you che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh them? and own them? and plead and diſpute for them? and ſay you do well to Doubt, and you have Cauſe? Will this ever caſt out Tormenting Fears? Do you not know that the way to caſt them out, is not to maintain them by diſtruſtful thoughts or words, but to ſee their ſinfulneſs, and abhor them, and to get more high thoughts of the Lovingkindneſs of God, and the tender mercies of the Redeemer, and the unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Love that he hath manifeſted in his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for you, that ſo the Love of God may be more advanced and powerful in your ſoul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and may be able to caſt out your Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting Fears. Why do you not do this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Doubting? If Tormenting Fears and Doubtings be a ſin, why do you not make Conſcience of them? and bewail it that you have been ſo guilty of them? Will you therefore Doubt becauſe you have ſlaviſh fears? Why that is to Doubt becauſe you Doubt; and to Fear becauſe you Fear; and ſo to ſin ſtill becauſe you have ſinned. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider well of the folly of this courſe.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. I Have anſwered this Doubt fully before. It is grounded on a Miſtake of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of true Faith. You think that Faith is the Believing that you are in Gods favour, and that you are Juſtified: but properly this is no Faith at all, but onely Aſſurance, which is ſometimes a fruit of Faith, and ſometimes never in this life obtained by a Believer. Faith conſiſteth of two parts; 1. Aſſent to the Truth of the Word. 2. Acceptance of Chriſt as he is offered; Which immediatly produceth a Truſting on Chriſt for ſalvation, and a Conſent to be Governed by him, and Reſolution to obey him; which in the fulleſt ſenſe are alſo acts of Faith. Now do not you Believe the truth of the Goſpel? And do you not Accept of Chriſt as he is offered therein? If you are truly willing to have
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:57538:253"/>
Chriſt as he is offered, I dare ſay you are a true Believer. If you be not willing, for ſhame never complain. Men uſe rather to ſpeak againſt thoſe that they are unwilling of, then complain of their abſence, and that they cannot enjoy them.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. FEeding your Doubts and Perplexities, and arguing for them, is not a means to get the Teſtimony and Joy of the Spirit: but rather ſtudying with all Saints to know the Love of Chriſt which paſſeth knowledge, to comprehend the height, and bredth, and

length, and depth of his Love: and ſeeking to underſtand the things that are given you of God. Acknowledge Gods general Love to Mankind, both in his Gracious Nature, and Common Providences, and Redemption by Chriſt, and deny not his Special Mercies to your ſelf, but dwell in the ſtudy of the Riches of Grace, and that's the way to come to the Joy of the Holy Ghoſt. 2. I have told you before what the witneſs of the Spirit is, and what is the ordinary miſtake herein. If you have the Graces and holy operations of the Spirit, you have the witneſs of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, whether you know it or not. 3. If by your own doubtings you have deprived your ſelf of the Joy of the Holy Ghoſt, bewail it, and do ſo no more; but do not therefore ſay you have not the Holy Ghoſt. For the Holy Ghoſt often works Regeneration and Holineſs, before he works any ſenſible Joys. 4. You have ſome hope of ſalvation by Chriſt left in you: You be not yet in utter deſpair: And is it no Comfort to you to think that you have yet any Hope? and are not quite paſt all Remedy? It may be your ſorrows may ſo cloud it that you take no notice of it: but I know you cannot have the leaſt Hope without ſome anſwerable Comfort.

Have you received no holy deſires, or other Graces from him? Nay, are you ſure that you are not a member of Chriſt, who is one with him? How can you then ſay, that you have no Communion with him? Can there be Communication of Prayer, and Obedience from you? yea your own ſelf delivered up to Chriſt? and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of any life of Grace from God, by Chriſt and the Spirit? and all this without Communion?

Do you not Deſire Chriſt and Grace, Juſtification and Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation? Do you not look to God as him who alone is able to ſupply your wants, and bids you ask that you may receive? Do you utterly deſpair of help, and to ſeek to none? Or do you make your addreſſes by Prayer to any but God? But perhaps you look at words, and matter to dilate upon, that you may be able to hold out in a long ſpeech to God, and you think that is the effect of the ſpirit of Prayer. But where do you find that in Gods Word? I confeſs that in many, and moſt, the ſpirit which helpeth to Deſires, doth alſo help to ſome kind of expreſſions: Becauſe if a man be of able natural parts, and have a tongue to expreſs his own mind, the promoting of holy Deſires will help men to expreſſions. For a full ſoul is hardly hindred from venting it ſelf: And experience teacheth us, that the ſpirits enflaming the heart with holy Affections, doth very much furniſh both the Invention and Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But this is but accidental and uncertain: For thoſe that are either men of unready tongues, or that are ſo ill bred among the

Will the Lord ever ſave ſuch an unworthy wretch as I? Will he ever give his Mercy and the blood of his Son, to one that hath ſo abuſed it?</p>
                  <div type="answer">
                     <head>ANSWER.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. THe Queſtion is not, with God, what you have been, but what you are? God takes men as they then are, and not as they were. 2. It is a dangerous thing to object the greatneſs of your Guilt againſt Gods mercy and Chriſts Merits! Do you think Chriſts ſatisfaction is not ſufficient? or that he dyed for ſmall ſins and not for great? Do you not know that he hath made ſatisfaction for all, and will pardon all, and hath given out the pardon of all in his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and that to all men, on Condition they will Accept Chriſt to pardon and heal them in his own way? Hath God made it his great deſign in the work of mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:57538:257"/>
to make his Love and Mercy as Honorable and wonderful, as he did his Power in the work of Creation? and wil you after all this oppoſe the greatneſs of your ſins againſt the greatneſs of this Mercy and Satisfaction? why, you may as wel think your ſelf to be ſuch a one that God could not or did not Make you, as to think your ſins ſo great that Chriſt could not or did not ſatisfie for them, or will not pardon them, if you Repent and Believe in him. 3. And for Worthineſs, I pray you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve: There is a twofold Worthineſs &amp; Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. There is a Legal Worthineſs and Righteouſneſs, which conſiſteth in a perfect obedience, which is the performance of the Conditions of the Law of Pure Nature and Works. This no man hath but Chriſt: and if you look after this Righteouſneſs or Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs in your ſelf, then do you depart from Chriſt, and make him to have dyed and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in vain; you are a Jew and not a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and are one of thoſe that <hi>Paul</hi> ſo much diſputeth againſt, that would be Juſtified by the Law. Nay you muſt not to much as once imagine that all your own Works can be any part of this Legal Righteouſneſs or Worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to you. Only Chriſts Satisfaction and Merit is in ſtead of this our Legal Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Worthineſs. God never gave Chriſt and Mercy to any but the unworthy in this
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:57538:258"/>
ſenſe: If you know not your ſelf to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy and unrighteous in the ſenſe of the Law of Works, you cannot know what Chriſts Righteouſneſs is. Did Chriſt come to ſave any but ſinners, and ſuch as were loſt? what need you a Saviour, if you were not Condemned? and how come you to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned if you were not unrighteous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy. But then 2. there is an Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal perſonal Worthineſs and Righteouſneſs, which is the Condition on which God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows Chriſts Righteouſneſs upon us: and this all have that will be ſaved by Chriſt. But what is that? Why it hath two parts: 1. The Condition and Worthineſs required to your Union with Chriſt and pardon of all your ſins paſt, and your Adoption and Juſtification; it is no more but <hi>your hearty thankful Acceptance of the Gift that is freely Given you of God by his Covenant-grant, that is, Chriſt and Life in him,</hi> 1 John 5.10, 11, 12. There is no wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs required in you before Faith as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition on which God will give you Faith: but onely certain means you are appointed to uſe for the obtaining it: And Faith it ſelf is but the Acceptance of a free Gift. God requireth you not to bring any other Worthineſs or Price in your hands; but that you conſent unfeignedly to have Chriſt as he is offered, and to the ends and uſes that he
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:57538:258"/>
is offered: that is, as one that hath ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for you by his blood and merits, to put away your ſins, and as one that muſt illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and Teach you, Sanctifie and Guide and Govern you by his Word and Spirit; and as King and Judge will fully and finally Juſtifie you at the day of Judgement, and give you the Crown of Glory. Chriſt on his part 1. Hath merited your pardon by his ſatisfaction, and not properly by his ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying you: 2. And ſanctifieth you by his Spirit, and Ruleth you by his Laws, and not directly by his bloodſhed: 3. And he will juſtifie you at Judgement as King and Judge, and not as Satisfier or Sanctifier: But the Condition on your part of obtaining Intereſt in Chriſt and his benefits, is that our Faith which accepteth him in all theſe reſpects (both as King, Prieſt and Teacher) and to all theſe ends conjunctly. But then 2. The Condition and Worthyneſs required to the Continuation and Conſummat on of your Pardon, Juſtification, and right to Glory, is both the Continuance of your faith, and your ſincere obedience, even your keeping the Baptiſmal Covenant that you made with Chriſt by your Parents, and the Covenant which you in your own perſon made with him in your firſt true Believing. Theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are called <hi>Worthineſs and Righteouſneſs</hi>
                        <pb n="456" facs="tcp:57538:259"/>
frequently in the Goſpel: but it is no wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs conſiſting in any ſuch works which make the Reward to be of Debt, and not of Grace (of which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks) but onely in faith, and ſuch Goſpel works as <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of which make the Reward to be wholly of Grace and not of Debt.</p>
                     <p>Now if you ſay you are unworthy in this Evangelical ſenſe, then you muſt mean (if you know what you ſay) that you are an Infidel or Unbeliever, or an Impenitent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Rebel that would not have Chriſt to reign over him: For the Goſpel calleth none Unworthy (as non-performers of its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions) but only theſe.

                     <head>ANSWER.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. I Have fully anſwered this before. If you can overcome the temptations of Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, you have no cauſe to doubt diſtruſtfully whether you ſhall overcome the temptations of Adverſity: And if God give you Grace to avoid Temptations to ſin, and fly occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as much as you can, and to overcome them, where you cannot avoid them; you have little reaſon to diſtruſt his preſervation of you, and your ſtedfaſtneſs thereby, if you ſhould be caſt upon greater Temptations Indeed if you feel not ſuch a Belief of the evil and danger of ſinning, as to poſſeſs you with ſome ſenſible hatred of it, you have need to look to your heart for the ſtrengthening of that Belief and Hatred: and fear your heart with a godly preſerving Jealouſie; but not with tormenting, diſquieting doubts. Whatever your Paſſionate Hatred be, if you have a ſettled well-grounded Reſolution, to walk in obedience to the death, you may confidently &amp; comfortably truſt him for your preſervation, who gave you thoſe reſolutions.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And the laſt ſentence of this Doubt, had need of great Caution, before you conclude it a certain Truth. Its true, that the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which by an ordinary Temptation,
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:57538:260"/>
ſuch as men may expect, would be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, is not well grounded and rooted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is overthrown. But its a great Doubt whether there be not Degrees of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Poſsible, which would overcome the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and Grace of the moſt Holy, having ſuch aſſiſtance as the Spirit uſually giveth Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in Temptation? And whether ſome Temptations which overcome not a ſtrong Chriſtian, would not overcome a weak one, who yet hath true Grace? I conclude nothing of theſe Doubts. But I would not have you trouble your ſelf upon confident concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on ſo doubtful Grounds. This I am certain of, 1. That the ſtrongeſt Chriſtian ſhould take heed of Temptations, and not truſt to the ſtrength of his Graces, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume on Gods preſervation while he wilfully caſteth himſelf in the mouth of dangers; nor to be encouraged hereunto upon any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of an Impoſſibility of his falling away. O the falls, the fearful falls that I have known (alas, how often) the eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt men for Godlineſs that ever I knew, to be Guilty of, by caſting themſelves upon Temptations.

                     <p>IT ſeems you know not what the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt is; It is this, When a man is convinced that Chriſt and his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples did really work thoſe glorious Miracles which are recorded in the Goſpel, and yet will not Believe that Chriſt is the Son of God, and his Doctrine true, though ſealed with all thoſe Miracles and other holy and wonderful works of the Spirit, but do Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly maintain that they were done by the Power of the Devil. This is the ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Ghoſt: And dare you ſay that you are guilty of this? If you be, then you do not Believe that Chriſt is the Son of God, and the Meſſiah, and his Goſpel true.

                     <p>HEre is ſufficient matter for Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but the Doubting ariſeth meerly from Ignorance: The day of Grace may in two reſpects be ſaid to be over: The firſt (and moſt properly ſo called) is, <hi>When God will not Accept of a ſinner, though he ſhould Repent and Return.</hi> This is never in this life for certain. And he that imagineth any ſuch thing, as that it is too late while his ſoul is in his body, to Repent and Accept of Chriſt and Mercy, is meerly ignorant of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and ſenſe of the Goſpel: For the New Law of Grace doth limit no time on earth for Gods Accepting of a Returning ſinner. True Faith and Repentance do as ſurely ſave at the laſt hour of the day, as at the firſt. God hath ſaid, that whoſoever Believeth in Chriſt, ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life. He hath no where excepted late Believers or Repenters: Shew any ſuch Exception if you can.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond ſenſe in which it may be ſaid that the day of Grace is over, is this: <hi>When a man hath ſo long reſiſted the Spirit, that God hath given him over to wilful obſtinate Refuſals of Mercy, and of Chriſts Government,
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:57538:262"/>
reſolving that he will never give him the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Grace of his Spirit.</hi> Where note, 1. That this ſame man might ſtill have Grace as ſoon as any other, if he were but Willing to Accept Chriſt, and Grace in him. 2. That no man can know of himſelf or any other, that God hath thus finally forſaken him: For God hath given us no ſign to know it by; (at leaſt who ſin not againſt the Holy Ghoſt.) God hath not told us his ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents concerning ſuch. 4. Yet ſome men have far greater cauſe to fear it then others; eſpecially thoſe men, who under the moſt ſearching lively Sermons, do continue ſecure and wilful in known wickedneſs; either hating godlineſs and godly perſons, and all that do Reprove them, or at leaſt being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pified, that they feel no more then a Poſt the force of Gods terrours, or the ſweetneſs of his promiſes; but make a jeſt of ſinning, and think the life of godlineſs a needleſs thing. Eſpecially if they grow old in this courſe, I confeſs ſuch have great Cauſe to fear leſt they are quite forſaken of God: For very few ſuch are ever recovered. 5. And therefore it may well be ſaid to all men, <hi>To day if you will hear his voyce harden not your hearts, &amp;c.</hi> and, <hi>This is the Acceptable time: this is the day of ſalvation</hi>; both as this life is called, <hi>The day of ſalvation</hi>; and becauſe
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:57538:263"/>
no man is certain to live another day, that he may Repent; nor yet to have Grace to Repent, if he Live. 6. But what's all this to you that do Repent? Can you have Cauſe to fear that your day of Grace is over, that have Received Grace? Why, that is as fooliſh a thing, as if a man ſhould come to the Market, and buy Corn, and when he hath done, go home lamenting that the Market was paſt before he came? Or as a man ſhould come and hear the Sermon, and when he hath done, lament that the Sermon was done before he came. If your day of Grace be paſt, tell me, (and do not wrong God) Where had you the Grace of Repentance? How came you by that Grace of holy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>res? Who made you Willing to have Chriſt for your Lord and Saviour? So that you had rather have him, and Gods favour, and a Holy heart and life, then all the glory of the World? How came you to deſire that you were ſuch a one as God would have you to be? and to deſire that all your ſins were dead, and might never live in you more? and that you were able to Love God, and Delight in him, and pleaſe him even in perfection? and that you are ſo troubled that you cannot do it? Are theſe ſigns that your day of Grace is over? Doth Gods Spirit breath out Groans after Chriſt and Grace, within you?
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:57538:263"/>
and yet is the day of Grace over? Nay, what if you had no Grace? Do you not hear God daily offering you Chriſt and Grace? doth he not intreat and Beſeech you to be Reconciled unto him (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 20.) and would he not compel you to come in? (<hi>Mat.</hi> 22.) Do you not feel ſome unquietneſs in your ſinful Condition? and ſome motions and ſtrivings at your heart to get out of it? Certainly (though you ſhould be one that hath yet no Grace to ſalvation) yet theſe continued offers of Grace, and ſtrivings of the Spirit of Chriſt with your heart, do ſhew that God hath not quite forſaken you; and that your day of Grace and Viſitation is not paſt.</p>

This may befal a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man And moreover, God may withdraw his Grace, as he did from <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>David</hi> in their ſin: and then our Conſiderations will work but faintly, and ſenſuality and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Paſſion will work effectually.

Zeal and Paſſion. But let me tell you, that you may grow in theſe, and not grow in the body of your Graces. Doubtleſs Satan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf may do much to kindle your Zeal, if he do but ſee it voyd of ſound Knowledge, (as he did in <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> when they would have called for Fire from Heaven, but knew not what ſpirit they were of.) For the dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Caſe of Chriſts Churches in this age hath put quite beyond diſpute, that none do the Devils work more effectually, nor oppoſe the Kingdom of Chriſt more deſperately, then they that have the hotteſt Zeal with the weakeſt Judgements: And as Fire is moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and neceſſary in the Chimney, but in the thatch it is worſe then the vileſt dung; ſo is Zeal moſt excellent when guided by ſound Judgement; but more deſtructive then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane ſenſuality when it is let looſe and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide, you may decay much in feeling and fervour of Affections, and yet Grow in Grace, if you do but grow in the Underſtanding and the Will. And indeed this is the Common Growth which Chriſtians have in their Age: Examine therefore whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have this or no. Do you not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the things of the Spirit better then you formerly did? Do you not value God, Chriſt, Glory and Grace at higher rates then
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:57538:268"/>
formerly? Are you not more fully Reſolved to ſtick to Chriſt to the death then formerly you have been? I do not think but it would be a harder work for Satan to draw you from Chriſt to the fleſh then heretofore. When the tree hath done growing in viſible great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it groweth in rootedneſs. The fruit grows firſt in bulk and quantity, and then in mellow ſweetneſs. Are not you leſs Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious, and more Peaceable then heretofore? I tell you, that is a more noble growth then a great deal of auſtere and bitter, youthful, cenſorious, dividing Zeal of many will prove. Mark moſt aged experienced Chriſtians, that walk uprightly, and you will find that they quite outſtrip the younger, 1. In experience, knowledge, prudence and foundneſs of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 2. In well-ſetled Reſolutions for Chriſt, his Truth and Cauſe. 3. In a Love of Peace, eſpecially in the Church, and a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of diſſentions, perverſe contendings and diviſions. If you can ſhew this growth, ſay not that you do not grow.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But ſuppoſe you do not grow? ſhould you therefore deny the ſincerity of your Grace? I would not perſwade any ſoul that they grow, when they do not.

Moſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy people, eſpecially that have any knowledge in Religion, are frequently haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Blaſphemous Temptations. I have oft wondred that the Devil ſhould have ſuch a power and advantage in the predominancy
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:57538:269"/>
of that diſtemper. Scarce one perſon of ten, who ever was with me in deep Melancholy, either for the Cure of body or mind, but hath been haunted with theſe Blaſphemous thoughts; and that ſo impetuouſly and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſet on and followed, that it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be from the Devil; yea even many that never ſeemed Godly, or to mind any ſuch thing before. I confeſs it hath been a ſtrengthening to my own faith, to ſee the Devil ſuch an Enemy to the Chriſtian faith, yea to the Godhead it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps you will ſay, <hi>It is not meer Temptation from Satan that I complain of; but it takes too much with my ſinful heart: I am ready to doubt oft-times whether there be a God, or whether his Providence determine of the things here below? or whether Scripture be true, or the Soul immortal? &amp;c.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>But again, let me adviſe you to take heed of this hainous ſin, and bewail and deteſt the very leaſt degree of it. It is dangerous when the Devil ſtrikes at the very root and heart &amp; foundation of all your religion. There is more ſinfulneſs and danger in this then in many other ſins. And therefore let it never be motioned to your ſoul without abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Two ways the Devil hath to move it. The one is by his immediate inward ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: theſe are bad enough. The other is by
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:57538:270"/>
his Accurſed Inſtruments: and this is a far more dangerous way: whether it be by books, or by the words of men: And yet if it be by notorious wicked men or fools, the Temptation is the leſs: but when it is by men of cunning wit, and ſmooth tongues, and hypocritical lives (for far be that wickedneſs from me, as to call them Godly, or wiſe or honeſt) then it is the greateſt ſnare that the Devil hath to lay. O juſt and Dreadful God! did I think one day that thoſe that I was then praying with, and rejoycing with, and that went up with me to the houſe of God in familiarity, would this day be blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers of thy ſacred Name? and deny the Lord that bought them? and deride thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly word as a fable? and give up themſelves to the preſent pleaſures of ſin, becauſe they Believe not thy promiſed Glory!

I call their Doctrine and Practice Helliſh, from its Original, becauſe it comes from the Father of Lyes: but not that there is any ſuch opinion or practice in Hell. He
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:57538:271"/>
that tempts others to Deny the Godhead, the Chriſtian faith, the Scripture, the Life to come, doth no whit doubt of any one of them himſelf, but believes and Trembles. O fearful blindneſs of the profeſſors of Religion, that wil hear, if not receive theſe Blaſphemies from the mouth of an Apoſtate Profeſſor, which they would abhor if it came immediately from the Devil himſelf. With what ſad complaints and trembling do poor ſinners cry out (and not without Cauſe) <hi>O I am haunted with ſuch Blaſpemous temptations, that I am afraid leſt God ſhould ſuddenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy me, that ever ſuch thoughts ſhould come into my heart</hi>: But if an Inſtrument of the Devil come and plead againſt the Scripture or the Life to come, or Chriſt himſelf, they will hear him with leſs deteſtation. The Devil knows that familiarity will cauſe us to take that from a man, which we would ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor from the Devil himſelf immediately. I intend not to give you now a particular preſervative againſt each of theſe Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Only let me tell you, that this is the direct way to Infidelity, Apoſtacy, and the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt: and if by any Seducers the Devil do overcome you herein, you are loſt for ever, <hi>and there will be no more ſacrifice for your ſin, but a fearful expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of judgment, and that fire which ſhal devour the adverſaries of Chriſt.</hi>

Thank God, if the fear of death be ſomewhat abated in you, though it be not ſweetned.

                     <p>I Would not have mentioned this Doubt, but that I was ſo fooliſh as to be troubled with it my ſelf: and perhaps ſome others may be as fooliſh as I: though I think but few in theſe times; our great friends have <hi>Done</hi> ſo much to Reſolve them more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually then words could have done. 1. Some of thoſe Texts ſpeak onely of mans duty of bearing perſecution and tribulation, when God lays it on us, rather then of the Event, that it ſhall certainly come. 2. Yet I think it ordinarily certain and to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected as to the Event: Doubtleſs Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is Gods common road to Heaven: Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ignorant perſon is ſo well ware of this, that they delude themſelves in their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſaying, That God hath given them their puniſhment in this life, and therefore they hope he will not puniſh them in another. If any ſoul be ſo ſilly as to fear and doubt, for want of Affliction; if none elſe will do the Cure, let them but follow my Counſel, and I dare warrant them for this, and I will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe them to nothing but what is honeſt, yea and neceſſary, and what I have tried effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon my ſelf: and I can aſſure you, it

cured me, and I can give it a <hi>Probatum eſt.</hi> And firſt, ſee that you be faithful in your Duty to all ſinners within your reach; be they great or ſmall, Gentlemen or Beggars, do your duty in Reproving them meekly and lovingly, yet plainly and ſeriouſly, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them of the danger of Gods everlaſting wrath; and when you find them obſtinate, tell the Church-Officers of them, that they may do their duty; and if yet they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reformed, they may be excluded from the Churches Communion, and all Chriſtian fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity. Try this courſe a while, and if you meet with no Afflictions, and get no more fiſts about your ears then your own, nor more tongues againſt you then formerly, tell me I am miſtaken.

He hath not told you when your Afflictions ſhall come: If he deal eaſier with you then others, and give you a longer time to prepare for them, be not you offended at that, and do not quarrel with your mercies. It is about ſeventeen
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:57538:274"/>
years ſince I was troubled with this Doubt, thinking I was no ſon, becauſe I was not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted; and I think I have had few days without pain for this ſixteen years ſince to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, nor but few hours, if any one, for this ſix or ſeven years: And thus my ſcruple is removed.</p>
                     <p>And if yet any be troubled with this Doubt, if the Churches and Common trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble be any trouble to them, ſhall I be bold to tell them my thoughts? (onely underſtand, that I pretend not to Propheſy, but to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture at Effects by the poſition of their Moral Cauſes.) <hi>I think that the Righteous King of Saints is even now, for our over-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring raſh zeal, and high profeſſion, making for England ſo heavy an Affliction and ſharp a ſcourge, to be inflicted by ſeduced, proud, ſelf-conceited Profeſſours, as neither we nor our Fathers did ever yet bear: Except it ſhould prove the merciful intent of our Father, onely to ſuffer them to ripen for their own deſtruction, to be a ſtanding Monument for the effectual warning of all after-ages of the Church, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pride and heady Zeal may bring Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of holineſs; And when they are full ripe, to do by them as at Munſter and in New-England, that they may go no further, but their folly may be known to all: Amen.</hi> I have told you of my thoughts of this long ago in my Book of <hi>Baptiſm.</hi>

I know you may eaſily tell a long and a ſad ſtory of your ſins, how you are troubled with this and that, and many a diſtemper, and weak and wanting in every Grace and Duty, and have committed many ſins: But doth it follow that therefore you have no true Grace? Learn therefore to be Humbled for every ſin, but not to Doubt of your ſincerity and ſalvation for every ſin.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p n="30">30. Whatſoever New Doubtings do ariſe in your ſoul, ſee that you care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſcern whether they are ſuch as muſt be reſolved from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of General Grace, or of Special Grace: And eſpecially be ſure of this, that when you want or loſe your Certainty of ſincerity and ſalvation, you have preſently recourſe to the Probability of it, and loſe not the Comforts of that: Or if you ſhould loſe the ſight of a Probability of Special Grace, yet ſee that you have recourſe at the utmoſt to General Grace, and never let go the Comforts of that at the worſt.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis Rule is of unſpeakable Neceſſity and uſe for your Peace and Comfort. Here are three ſeveral Degrees of the Grounds of Comfort. It is exceeding weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:57538:276"/>
for a man that is beaten from one of theſe holds, therefore to let go the other too: and becauſe he cannot have the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Degree, therefore to conclude that he hath none at all.</p>
               <p>I beſeech you in all your Doubtings and Complainings ſtill Remember the two Rules here laid down. 1. All Doubts ariſe not from the ſame Cauſe, and therefore muſt not have the ſame Cure. Let the firſt thing which you do upon every doubt, be this: To conſider <hi>Whether it come from the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing or low Apprehenſions of the General Grounds of Comfort, or from the want of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſpecial Grace</hi>? For that which is a fit Remedy for one of theſe, will do little for the cure of the other. 2. If your Doubting be onely <hi>Whether you be ſincere in Beli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ving, Loving, Hoping, Repenting and Obeying</hi>? then it will not anſwer this Doubt, though you diſcern never ſo much of Gods Merciful Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or Chriſts Gracious Office, or the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſufficiency of his Death and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the freeneſs and extent of the Promiſe of Pardon. For I profeſs conſiderately, that I do not know in all the Body of Popery concerning Merits, Juſtification, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Satisfactions, Aſſurance or any other point about Grace, for which we unchurch them, that they erre half ſo dangerouſly, as
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:57538:276"/>
                  <hi>Saltmarſh</hi> and ſuch Antinomians do in this one point, when they ſay, That <hi>Chriſt hath Repented and Believed for us</hi>; meaning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it of that Faith and Repentance which he hath made the Conditions of our ſalvation: and that <hi>We muſt no more queſtion our own faith, then we muſt queſtion Chriſt the Object of it.</hi> It will be no ſaving Plea at the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſay, <hi>Though I Repented not, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not, yet Chriſt dyed for me, or God is merciful, or Chriſt Repented and Believed for me, or God made me a free Promiſe and Gift of ſalvation, if I would Repent and Believe.</hi> What Comfort would ſuch an Anſwer give them? And therefore doubtleſs it will not ſerve now to quiet any knowing Chriſtian againſt thoſe Doubts that ariſe from the want of particular evidence of ſpecial Grace: though in their own place, the General Grounds of Comfort are of Abſolute Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity thereto.</p>
               <p n="2">2. On the other ſide, if your Doubts ariſe from any Defect in your Apprehenſions of General Grace; it is not your looking after Marks in your ſelf that is the way to Reſolve them. I told you in the beginning, that the General Grounds of Comfort lie in four par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars (that ſquare Foundation which will bear up all the Faith of the Saints.) Firſt, Gods merciful and unconceivably Good and
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:57538:277"/>
Gracious Nature, and his Love to mankind. Secondly, the Gracious Nature of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour God and Man, with his moſt Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious undertaken Office of Saving and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling. Thirdly, the ſufficiency of Chriſts Death and ſatisfaction for all the world, to ſave them if they will Accept him and his Grace: I put it in terms beyond diſpute, becauſe I would not build up Believers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts on points which godly Divines do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict (as little as may be:) Yet I am paſt all Doubt my ſelf, that Chriſt did actually make ſatisfaction to Gods Juſtice for All; and that no man periſheth for want of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory ſacrifice, but for want of faith to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and apply it, or for want of Repentance, and yielding to Recovering Grace. The fourth is, The Univerſal Grant of pardon, and Right to ſalvation, on Condition of Faith and Repentance. If your Doubt ariſe from the Ignorance or overlooking of any of theſe, to theſe muſt you have recourſe for your Cure.</p>
               <p>Where Note, that all thoſe Doubts which come from the greatneſs of your ſin, as ſuch that you think will not therefore be forgiven, or that come from the ſenſe of Unworthineſs, (in a Legal ſenſe) or want of Merit in your ſelf, and all your Doubts whether God be willing to accept and forgive you, though
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:57538:277"/>
you ſhould Repent and believe; or whether any ſacrifice was offered by Chriſt for your ſins; I ſay, all theſe come from your Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or Unbelief of ſome or all of the four General Grounds here mentioned; and from them muſt be cured.</p>
               <p>Note alſo in a ſpecial manner, That there is a great difference between theſe four Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Grounds, and your particular Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences in point of Certainty: For theſe four Corner-ſtones are faſt founded beyond all poſſibility of Removal; ſo that they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways of as undoubted Certainty as that the Heaven is over your head; and they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable; ſtill the ſame. Theſe you are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſtrictly to Believe with a Divine Faith, as being the clearly revealed Truths of God; and if you ſhould not Believe them, yet they remain firm and true, and your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief ſhould not make voyd the Univerſal promiſe and Grace of God. But your own Evidences of ſpecial Grace, are not ſo Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſo Clear, or ſo Immutable; nor are you bound to Believe them, but to ſearch after them that you may know them: You are not bound by any Word of God ſtrictly to Believe that you do Believe, or Repent, but to try and diſcern it. This then is the firſt part of this Direction, That you always diſcover whether your troubles ariſe from
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:57538:278"/>
low unbelieving or ignorant thoughts of Gods Mercifulneſs, Chriſts Gracious nature and office, General Satisfaction, or the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Promiſe: or whether they ariſe from want of evidence of ſincerity in your ſelf? and accordingly in your thoughts apply the Remedy.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part of the Direction is, that you hold faſt <hi>Probabilities</hi> of Special Grace when you loſe your <hi>Certainty,</hi> and that you hold faſt your General Grounds when you loſe both the former. Never forget this in any of your Doubts.</p>
               <p>You ſay, your faith and obedience have ſuch breaches and ſad defects in them, that you cannot be <hi>Certain</hi> that they are ſincere. Suppoſe it be ſo: Do you ſee no great <hi>Likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> or hopes yet that they are ſincere? If you do (as I think many Chriſtians eaſily may, that yet receive not a proportionable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort) remember that this is no ſmall Mercy, but matter of great conſolation.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe the worſt, that you <hi>ſee</hi> no Grace in your ſelf: yet you cannot be ſure you have none: For it may be there, and you not ſee it. Yea ſuppoſe the worſt, that you were <hi>ſure</hi> that you had no true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Grace at all, yet remember that you have ſtill abundant cauſe of Comfort in Gods General Grace. Do you think you muſt needs Deſpair, or
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:57538:278"/>
give up all Hope and Comfort, or conclude your ſelf irrecoverably loſt, becauſe you are Graceleſs? why be it known to you there is that ground of Conſolation in general Grace that may make the hearts of the very wicked to leap for joy. Do I need to prove that to you? You know that the Goſpel is called <hi>Glad tidings of ſalvation,</hi> and the Preachers of it are to tell thoſe to whom they preach it. <hi>Behold we bring you tidings of great Joy, and glad tidings to all People.</hi> And you know before the Goſpel comes to men they are miſerable. If then it be glad tidings and tidings of great joy to all the unconverted where it comes, why ſhould it not be ſo to you? and where is your great joy? If you be Graceleſs, is it nothing to know that God is exceeding merciful, <hi>ſlow to anger, ready to forgive, pardoning iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin?</hi> loving mankinde? Is it nothing to know that the Lord hath brought Infinite Mercy and Goodneſs down into humane fleſh? and hath taken on him the moſt bleſſed office of Reconciling, and is become the Lamb of God? Is it nothing to you, that all your ſins have a ſufficient Sacrifice paid for them, ſo that you are certain not to periſh for want of a Ranſom? Is it nothing to you, that God hath made ſuch an univerſal Grant of Pardon and Salvation to all that will Believe: and
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:57538:279"/>
that you are not on the terms of the meer Law of Works, to be judged for not obeying in perfection? Suppoſe you are never ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Graceleſs, is it not a Ground of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Comfort, that you may be certain that <hi>nothing can condemn you, but a flat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal or unwillingneſs to have Chriſt and his Salvation.</hi> This is a certain truth, which may comfort a man as yet unſanctified, that ſin meerly as ſin ſhall not Condemn him; nor any thing in the World, but the final ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Refuſal of the Remedy, which thereby leaveth all other ſin unpardoned.</p>
               <p>Now I would ask you this Queſtion in your greateſt fears that you are out of Chriſt: Are you Willing to have Chriſt to pardon, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, guide and ſave you? or not? If you are; then you are a true Believer, and did not know it. If you are not; if you will but wait on Gods Word in Hearing and Reading, and Conſider frequently and ſeriouſly of the neceſſity and excellency of Chriſt and Glory, and the evil of ſin, &amp; the vanity of the world, and wil but beg earneſtly of God to make you Willing, you ſhall finde that God hath not appointed you this means in vain, &amp; that this way will be more profitable then all your complainings. See therefore when you are at the very loweſt, that you forſake not the Comforts of General Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="497" facs="tcp:57538:279"/>And indeed thoſe that deny any General Grace or Redemption, Do leave poor Chriſtians in a very lamentable Condition. For, alas, Aſſurance of Special Grace (yea or a high probability) is not ſo common a thing as meer Diſputers againſt Doubting have imagined. And when a poor Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is beaten from his Aſſurance (which few have) he hath nothing but Probabilities: and when he hath no confident probable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of ſpecial Grace, where is he then? and what hath he left to ſupport his ſoul? I will not ſo far now meddle with that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, as to open further how this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion tends to leave moſt Chriſtians in deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, for all the pretences it hath found? and I had done more, but that General Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption or Satisfaction is commonly taught in the maintaining of the General Sufficiency of it, though men underſtand not how they contradict themſelves.</p>
               <p>But perhaps you will ſay, This is cold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: for I may as well argue thus, <hi>Chriſt will damn ſinners: I am a ſinner, therefore he will damn me</hi>: as to argue thus, <hi>Chriſt will ſave ſinners: I am a Sinner: therefore he will ſave me.</hi> I anſwer: There is no ſhew of ſoundneſs in either of theſe Arguments. It is not a <hi>certainty</hi> that Chriſt will ſave you, that can be gathered from General Grace alone:
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:57538:280"/>
that muſt be had from aſſurance of of ſpecial Grace ſuperadded to the General. But a conditional certainty you may have from General Grace onely: and thus you may ſoundly and infallibly argue, <hi>God hath made a Grant to every ſinful man, of Pardon and ſalvation through Chriſts Sacrifice, if they will but Repent and Believe in Chriſt: but I am a ſinful man, therefore God hath made this Grant of Pardon and Salvation to me.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>If God do bleſs you with an able, faithful, prudent, judicious Paſtor, take him for your Guide under Chriſt in the way to Salvation; and open to him your Caſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire his advice in all your extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary preſſing neceſſities, where you have found the advice of other godly friends to be inſufficient: And this not once or twice only, but as often as ſuch preſſing neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities ſhall return. Or if your own Paſtor be more defective for ſuch a work, make uſe of ſome other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Chriſt, who is more meet.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HEre I have theſe ſeveral things to open to you. 1. That it is your Duty to ſeek this Direction from the Guides of the Church. 2. When and in what caſes you
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:57538:281"/>
ſhould do this. 3. To what end, and how far. 4. What Miniſters they be that you ſhould chooſe thereto. 5. In what manner you muſt open your Caſe, that you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt hath two parts. 1. That you muſt open your Caſe. 2. And that to your Paſtor. 1. The Devil hath great advantage while you keep his Counſel: Two are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then one; for if one of them fall he hath another to help him. It is dangerous Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch an enemy alone. An uniting of forces oft procureth victory. God giveth others knowledge, prudence, and other gifts for our good: that ſo every member of the body may have need of another, and each be uſeful to the other. An Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of Chriſtian upon Chriſtian, is moſt unchriſtian: much more of people on their Guides. It ceaſeth to be a Member, which is ſeparated from the body: and to make no uſe of the body or fellow members, is next to ſeparation from them. Sometime baſhfulneſs is the cauſe, ſometimes ſelf-confidence (a far worſe cauſe;) but whatever is the cauſe of Chriſtians ſmothering their Doubts, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects are oft ſad. The diſeaſe is oft gone ſo far, that the Cure is very difficult, before ſome baſhful or proud or tender Patients will open their diſeaſe. The very opening
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:57538:281"/>
of a mans grief to a faithful friend, doth oft eaſe the heart of it ſelf. 2. And that this ſhould be done to your Paſtor, I will ſhew you further anon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But you muſt underſtand well <hi>when</hi> this is your Duty. 1. Not in every ſmall infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which accompanies Chriſtians in their daily moſt watchful Converſation: Nor yet in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very leſſer Doubt, which may be otherways reſolved. It is a folly and a wrong to Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians to run to them for every cut finger or prick with a pin. Every neighbour can help you in this. 2. Nor except it be a weighty caſe indeed, go not firſt to a Miniſter. But firſt ſtudy the caſe your ſelf, and ſeek Gods direction: If that will not ſerve, open your caſe to your neareſt boſom friend that is godly and judicious. And in theſe two caſes always go to your Paſtor: 1. In caſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vater means can do you no Good: then God calls you to ſeek further. If a cut finger ſo feſter that ordinary means will not cure it, you muſt go to the Phyſician. 2. If the caſe be weighty and dangerous: For then none but the more prudent advice is to be truſted. If you be ſtruck with a dangerous diſeaſe, I would not have you delay ſo long, nor wrong your ſelf ſo much as to ſtay while you tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with every womans medicine, but go pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to the Phyſician. So if you either fall
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:57538:282"/>
into any grievous ſin, or any terrible pangs of Conſcience, or any great ſtreights and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties about matters of Doctrine or Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, go preſently to your Paſtour for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. The Devil, and Pride, and Baſhfulneſs will do their utmoſt to hinder you; but ſee that they prevail not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Next conſider to what End you muſt do this. Not 1. either to expect that a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter can of himſelf create Peace in you: or that all your Doubts ſhould vaniſh as ſoon as ever you have opened your mind. Onely the great Peacemaker, the Prince of Peace, can create Peace in you: Aſcribe not to any the office of the Holy Ghoſt, to be your ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Comforter. To expect more from man then belongs to man, is the way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nothing from him, but to cauſe God to blaſt to you the beſt endeavours. 2. Nor muſt you reſolve to take all meerly from the word of your Paſtour, as if he were Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Nor abſolutely to Judge of your ſelf as he Judgeth. For he may be too rigorous, or more commonly too charitable in his opinion of you: There may be much of your diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and converſation unknown to him, which may hinder his right Judging. But 1. You muſt uſe your Paſtour as the ordained Inſtrument &amp; Meſſenger of the Lord Jeſus &amp; his Spirit, appointed to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:57538:282"/>
to the weary, and to ſhew to man his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and to ſtrengthen the weak hands and feeble knees, yea and more, to bind and looſe on Earth, as Chriſt doth bind and looſe in Heaven. As Chriſt and his Spirit do onely ſave in the principal place, and yet Miniſters ſave ſouls in ſubordination to them as his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments. <hi>Act.</hi> 26.17, 18. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.15, 16. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.20. So Chriſt and the Spirit are as Principal Cauſes the onely Comforters: but his Miniſters are Comforters under him. 2. And that which you muſt expect from them is theſe two things. 1. You muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect thoſe fuller diſcoveries of Gods Will, then you are able to make your ſelf, by which you may have aſſurance of your duty to God, and of the ſenſe of Scripture, which expreſſeth how God will deal with you: That ſo a clearer diſcovery of Gods mind may Reſolve your Doubts. 2. In the mean time till you can come to a full Reſolution, you may and muſt ſomewhat ſtay your ſelf on the very Judgement of your Paſtour: Not as Infallible; but as a diſcovery of the Probability of your Good or bad eſtate: and ſo of your duty alſo. Though you will not renounce your own underſtanding, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any man when you know he is deceived, or would deceive you, yet you will ſo far ſuſpect your own reaſon, and value an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others,
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:57538:283"/>
as to have a ſpecial regard to every mans Judgement in his own Profeſſion. If the Phyſician tell you that your diſeaſe is not dangerous, or the Lawyer that your Cauſe is good, it will more Comfort you then if another man ſhould ſay as much. It may much ſtay your heart till you can reach to clear Evidences and Aſſurance, to have a Paſtor that is well acquainted with you, and is faithful and Judicious to tell you that he verily thinks that you are in a ſafe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. 3. But the chief uſe of his Advice is, not ſo much to tell you what he thinks of you, as to give you Directions how you may Judge of your ſelf, and come out of your trouble: Beſides the benefit of his Prayers to God for you.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Next let me tell you what men you muſt chooſe to open your mind to: And they muſt be, 1. Men of Judgement and Knowledge, and not the Ignorant, be they never ſo honeſt: Elſe they may deceive you, not knowing what they do: either for want of underſtanding the Scripture, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Grace and Sin; or for want of skill to deal with both weak Conſciences, and deep deceitful hearts. 2. They muſt be truly fearing God, and of experience in this great work. For a Troubled ſoul is ſeldom well reſolved and comforted meerly out of a
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:57538:283"/>
Book; but from the Book and Experience both together. Carnal or formal men will but make a Jeſt at the Doubts of a Troubled Chriſtian; or at leaſt will give you ſuch for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Remedies as will prove no Cure: Either they will perſwade you, as the Antinomians do, that you ſhould truſt God with your ſoul, and never Queſtion your Faith: Or that you do ill to trouble your ſelf about ſuch things: Or they will direct you onely to the Comforts of General Grace, and tell you onely that God is Merciful, and Chriſt dyed for ſinners: which are the neceſſary Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of our Peace; but will not anſwer particular Doubts of our own ſincerity and of our Intereſt in Chriſt: Or elſe they will make you believe that Holineſs of heart and life (which is the thing you look after) is it that troubleth you and breeds all your ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: Or elſe with the Papiſts, they will ſend you to your Merits for Comfort; or to ſome Vindictive Penance in Faſtings, Pilgrimages, or the like; or to ſome Saint departed, or Angel, or to the Pardons or Indulgencies of the Pope: or to a certain, formal, carnal Devotion, to make God amends. 3. They muſt be men of downright Faithfulneſs, that will deal plainly and freely, though not cruelly: and not like thoſe tender Surgeons that will leave the Cure undone for fear of

hurting: Meddle not with men-pleaſers and daubers, that will preſently ſpeak Comfort to you as Confidently as if they had known you twenty years, when perhaps they know little of your heart or Caſe. Deal not with ſuch as reſolve to humour you. 4. They muſt be men of fidelity, and well tryed to be ſuch, that you may truſt them with thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets which you are called to Reveal. 5. They muſt be men of great ſtayedneſs and wiſdom, that they may neither raſhly paſs their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor ſet you upon unſound, unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table or dangerous Courſes. 6. It is ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious if they be men that are ſo Impudent as to draw out your ſecrets, and ſcrue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves deeper into your privateſt thoughts and ways then is meet: Yet a compaſſionate Miniſter, when he ſeeth that poor Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans do endanger themſelves by keeping ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret their Troubles, or elſe that they hazard themſelves by hiding the greateſt of their ſins, like <hi>Achan, Saul,</hi> or <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> and ſo play the Hypocrites; in theſe Caſes he may and muſt urge them to deal openly. 7. Above all be ſure that thoſe that you ſeek advice of be ſound in the Faith, and free from the two deſperate plagues of notorious falſe doctrine, and ſeparating dividing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, that do but hunt about to make Diſciples to themſelves. There are two of
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:57538:284"/>
the former ſort, and three of the latter, that I would charge you to take heed of (and yet all is but four) 1. Among thoſe that erre from the Faith (next to Pagans, Jews and Infidels, whether Ranters, Seekers or Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which I think few ſober godly men are ſo much in danger of, becauſe of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme vileneſs) I would eſpecially have you avoyd the Antinomians, being the greateſt pretenders to the right comforting afflicted Conſciences in the world: but upon my cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge I dare ſay they are notorious ſubverters of the very nature of the Goſpel, and that free Grace which they ſo much talk of, and the great diſhonorers of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, whom they ſeem ſo highly to extoll. They are thoſe Mountebanks and Quack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalvers that delude the world by vain oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and kill more then they well Cure. 2. Next to them, take heed of the Papiſts, who will go to <hi>Rome,</hi> to Saints, to Angels, to Merits, to the moſt carnal deluſory means for Comfort, when they ſhould go to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and to Heaven for it.</p>
               <p>And then take heed that you fall not into the hands of ſeparating dividers of Chriſts Church. The moſt notorious and dangerous of them are of theſe three ſorts: 1. The laſt mentioned, the Papiſts: They are the moſt notorious Schiſmaticks and Separatiſts that
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:57538:285"/>
ever Gods Church did know on Earth: For my part, I think their Schiſm is more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and wicked then the reſt of their falſe Doctrine. The unmerciful, proud, ſelf-ſeeking wretches would like the Donatiſts, make us believe that God hath no true Church on Earth but they: and that all the Chriſtians in <hi>Ethiopia, Aſia, Germany, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary, France, England, Scotland, Ireland, Belgia,</hi> and the reſt of the World that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge not their Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> to be Head of all the Churches in the World, are none of Chriſts Churches, nor ever were. Thus do they ſeparate from all the Churches on Earth, and confine all Religion and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to themſelves, who ſo notoriouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from Chriſts way of ſalvation. Indeed the extreme diligence that they uſe in viſiting the ſick, and ſoliciting all men to their Church and way, is plainly to get themſelves follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and they are everywhere more induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to enlarge the Popes Kingdom, then Chriſts. So far are they from ſtudying the Unity of the Catholick Church which they ſo much talk of, that they will admit none to be of that Church, nor to be ſaved, but their own party, as if indeed the Pope had the Keys of Heaven. Indeed they are the moſt impudent Sectaries and Schiſmaticks on Earth. 2. The next to them are the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:57538:285"/>
whoſe Doctrine is not in it ſelf ſo dangerous as their Schiſm and gathering Diſciples ſo zealouſly to themſelves: And ſo ſtrange a curſe of God hath followed them hitherto, as may deter any ſober Chriſtian from raſh adventuring on their way. Even now when they are higher in the world then ever they were on earth, yet do the judicious ſee Gods heavy judgement upon them, in their Congregations and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. 3. Laſtly, meddle not with thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Separatiſts; for they will make a prey of you for the increaſe of their party. I do not mean that you ſhould ſeparate from theſe two laſt, as they do from us, and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with them, nor acknowledge them Chriſtians. But ſeek not their advice and make them not of your counſel. You will do as one that goes to a Phyſician that hath the plague, to be cured of a cut finger, if you go for your comfort to any of theſe Seducers. But if you have a Paſtor that is ſound in the main Doctrines of Religion, and is ſtudious of the Unity and Peace of the Church, ſuch a man you may uſe, though in many things miſtaken; for he will not ſeek to make a Prey of you by drawing you to his party. Let him be Lutheran, Calviniſt, Arminian, Epiſcopal, Independant, or Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian, ſo he be ſound in the main, and free
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:57538:286"/>
from Diviſion. Thus I have ſhewed you the Qualifications of theſe men that you muſt ſeek advice of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let me next adde this: Let them be rather Paſtors then private men, if it may be: And rather your own Paſtor then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, if they are fit. For the firſt conſider, 1. It is their office to be Guides of Chriſts Diſciples under him, and to be ſpiritual Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians for the curing of ſouls. And expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience telleth us (and ſadly of late) what a curſe followeth thoſe that ſtep beyond the bounds of their calling by invading this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and that God bleſſeth means to them that keep within his order, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5 12, 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7.17. Not but that private men may help you in this, as a private neighbour may give you a Medicine to cure your diſeaſe; but you will not ſo ſoon truſt them in any weighty caſe as you will the Phyſician. 2. Beſides Miniſters have made it the ſtudy of their lives, and therefore are liker to underſtand it then others. As for thoſe that think long ſtudy no more conducible to the knowledge of Scriptures, then if men ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not at all, they may as well Renounce Reaſon, and diſpute for preheminency of beaſts above men, as renounce ſtudy which is but the uſe of Reaſon. But it appears how conſiderately theſe men ſpeak themſelves, and
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:57538:286"/>
whence it comes, and how much credit a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-Chriſtian ſhould give them! Let them read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2, 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.11, 12, 13, 14. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13, 14, 15, 16. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. and let them return to their wits. <hi>Paul</hi> commands <hi>Timothy,</hi> though he was from his youth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Scriptures, <hi>Meditate upon theſe things: Give thy ſelf Wholly to them, that thy profiting may appear to all</hi>: How much need have we to do ſo now? 3. Alſo Miniſters are uſually moſt <hi>experienced</hi> in this work: And wiſdom requires you no more to truſt your ſoul then you would do your body with an unexperienced man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And if it may be (he being fit) let it be rather your own Paſtor then another: 1 Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it belongeth to his peculiar place and charge, to Direct the ſouls of his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. 2. Becauſe he is likelier to know you, and to fit his advice to your eſtate, as having better opportunity then others to be acquainted with your converſation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Next conſider, in what manner you muſt open your Grief, if you would have Cure. 1. Do it as truly as you can. Make the matter neither better nor worſe then it is. Specially take heed of dealing like <hi>Ananias</hi>; pretending to open all (as he did to Give all) when you do but open ſome common infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and hide all the moſt diſgraceful di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:57538:287"/>
of your heart and ſins of your life. The Vomit of Confeſſion muſt work to the bottom and fetch up that hidden ſin, which is it that continueth your Calamity. Read Mr. <hi>T. Hooker</hi> in his <hi>Souls Preparation,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Confeſſion; who ſhews you the danger of not going to the bottom.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You muſt not go to a Miniſter to be cured meerly by Good words, as Wizards do by charms; and ſo think that all is well when he hath ſpoken comfortably to you: But you muſt go for Directions for your own Practice, that ſo the cure may be done by lieſure when you come home. Truly moſt even of the godly that I have known, do go to a Miniſter for comfort, as
ſilly people go a Phyſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cian for Phyſick. If the Phyſician could ſtroak them whole, or give them a penny worth of ſome pleaſant ſtuff, that would cure all in an hour, then they would praiſe him. But alas, the cure will not be done 1. Without coſt. 2. Nor without time and patience. 3. Nor without taking down unpleaſing medicines; and ſo they let all alone. So you come to a Miniſter for advice and comfort; and you look that his words ſhould comfort you before he leaves you, or at leaſt, ſome ſhort ſmall direction to take home with you: But he tells you, if you will be cured you muſt more Reſolve againſt that
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:57538:287"/>
diſquieting Corruption and Paſſion; you muſt more meekly ſubmit to Reproof: you muſt walk more watchfully and conſcionably with God and men; and then you muſt not give ear to the Tempter, with many the like; he gives you, as I have done here, a bill of thirty ſeveral Directions, and tells you, you muſt practiſe all theſe. O this ſeems a tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous courſe; You are never the nearer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for Hearing theſe: it muſt be by long and diligent practiſing them. Is it not a fooliſh Patient that will come home from the Phyſitian, and ſay, <hi>I have heard all that he ſaid: but I am never the better?</hi> So you ſay, <hi>I have heard all that the Miniſter ſaid, and I have never the more comfort.</hi> But have you <hi>Done</hi> all that he bid you? and <hi>Taken</hi> all the Medicines that he gave you? Alas, the cure is moſt to be done by your ſelf (under Chriſt) when you come home: The Miniſter is but the Phyſician to direct you what courſe to take for the cure. And then, as ſilly People run from one Phyſician to another, hearing what all can ſay, and deſirous to know what every man thinks of them, but throughly follow the advice of none, but perhaps take one medicine from one man, and one from another, and let moſt even of thoſe lie by them in the box, and ſo periſh more certainly then if they never med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:57538:288"/>
with any at all: ſo do moſt troubled ſouls, hear what one man ſaith, and what another ſaith, and ſeldom throughly follow the advice of any: but when one mans words do not cure them, they ſay, This is not the man that God hath appointed to cure me: And ſo another, and that is not the man: When they ſhould rather ſay, <hi>This is not the way,</hi> then <hi>This is not the man</hi>: This lazy complaining is not it that will do the work; but faithful practiſing the Directions given you.</p>
               <p>But I know ſome will ſay, <hi>That it is near to Popiſh Auricular Confeſſion which I here perſwade Chriſtians to, and it is to bring Chriſtians under the Tyranny of the Prieſts again, and make Them acquainted with all mens ſecrets, and Maſters of their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. To the laſt, I ſay, to the railing Devil of this age, no more but, <hi>The Lord Rebuke thee.</hi> If any Miniſter have wicked ends, let the God of heaven convert<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> him, or root him out of his Church, and caſt him among the weeds and bryers. But is it not the known voyce of Senſuality and Hell, to caſt reproaches upon the way and ordinances of God? who knoweth not that it is the very Office of the Miniſtery, to be Teachers and Guides to men in matters of ſalvation? and
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:57538:288"/>
Overſeers of them? and <hi>that they watch for their ſouls, as thoſe that muſt give an account?</hi> and the people therefore bound to obey them? <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7, 17. ſhould not the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd know his ſheep, and their ſtrayings and diſeaſes? How elſe ſhall he cure them? ſhould not the Phyſician hear the Patient o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen all his diſeaſe, yea ſtudy to diſcover to the utmoſt every thing he knows; and all little enough to the cure? A diſeaſe unknown is unlike to be cured: and a diſeaſe well known is half cured. Mr. <hi>Tho. Hooker</hi> ſaith truly, It is with many people as with ſome over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt Patients, who having a diſeaſe in ſome ſecret place, they will not for ſhame reveal it to the Phyſician, till it be paſt cure, and then they muſt loſe their lives by their modeſty: So do many by their ſecret and more diſgraceful ſins. Not that every man is bound to open all his ſins to his Paſtor: but thoſe that cannot well be otherwiſe cured, he muſt: either if the ſenſe of the guilt cannot be removed, and true Aſſurance of pardon obtained: or elſe, if power againſt the ſin be not otherwiſe obtained, but that it ſtill prevaileth: In both theſe caſes we muſt go to thoſe that God hath made our Directors and Guids: I am confident many a thouſand ſouls do long ſtrive againſt Anger, Luſt, Fleſh-pleaſing. Worldlineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Trouble
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:57538:289"/>
of Conſcience to little purpoſe, who if they would but have taken Gods way, and ſought out for help, and opened all their caſe to their Miniſter, they might have been delivered in a good meaſure long ago. 2. And for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh confeſſion, I deteſt it: We would not perſwade men that there is a neceſſity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing every ſin to a Miniſter before it can be pardoned. Nor do we do it in a perplexed formality only at one time of the year: nor in order to Popiſh pardons, or Satisfactions: But we would have men go for Phyſick to their ſouls, as they do for their bodies; when they feel they have need; And let me adviſe all Chriſtian Congregations to practiſe this excellent duty more. See that you knock oftner at your Paſtors door, and ask his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in all your preſſing neceſſities: Do not let him ſit quiet in his ſtudy for you: Make him know by experience that the tenth part of a Miniſters labor is not in the Pulpit. If your ſins are ſtrong, and you have wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Conſcience deep, go for his advice for a ſafe cure: Many a mans ſore feſters to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for want of this: And poor igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and ſcandalous ſinners have far more need to do this then troubled Conſciences. I am confident, if the people of my Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation did but do their duty for the good of their own ſouls in private ſeeking advice of
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:57538:289"/>
their Miniſters and opening their caſes to them, they would finde work for ten Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters at leaſt: And yet thoſe two that they have, have more work then they are able to do already. Eſpecially Miniſters in ſmall Countrey Congregations, might do abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Good this way: And their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are much too blame that they come not oftner to them for advice: This were the way to make Chriſtians indeed. The Devil knows this, and therefore ſo envies it, that he never did more againſt a deſign in the world: he hath got the Maintenance alienated that ſhould have maintained them, that ſo they may have but one Miniſter in a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and then among the greater Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations this work is impoſſible for want of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments: yea he is about getting down the very Churches and ſettled Miniſtery, if God will ſuffer him. He ſetteth his Inſtruments to rail at Prieſts and Diſcipline, and to call Chriſts yoke Tyranny; becauſe while the Garden is hedged in, he is fain with envy to look over the hedge. What if a man (like thoſe of our times) ſhould come to a Town that have an Epidemical Pleurifie or Feaver, and ſay, <hi>Do not run l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ke fools to theſe Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; they do but cheat you, and rob your purſes, and ſeek themſelves, and ſeek to be Lords of your lives.</hi> Its poſſible ſome do ſo: But if by
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:57538:290"/>
theſe perſwaſions the ſilly people ſhould loſe their lives, how well had their new preacher befriended them? ſuch friends will thoſe prove at laſt to your ſouls, that diſſwade you from obeying the Guidance and Diſcipline of your Overſeers, and dare call the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Lord of Glory Tyrannical, and reproach thoſe that Chriſt hath ſet over them. <hi>England</hi> will not have Chriſt by his officers Rule over them; nor the ſeveral Congregations will not obey him. But he will make them know before many years are paſt, that they refuſed their own mercy; and knew not the things that belong to their Peace; and that he will be maſter at laſt in ſpight of Malice, and the proudeſt of his foes. If they get by this bargain of Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Chriſts Government, and Deſpiſing his Miniſters, and making the Peace, Unity and Proſperity of his Church, and the ſouls of men, a Prey to their Proud miſguided Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and Paſſions, then let them boaſt of the bargain, when they have tryed it. Only I would intreat one thing of them: Not to judge too confidently till they have ſeen the end.</p>
               <p>And for all you tender Conſcienc'd Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, whom by the Miniſtry the Lord hath begotten or confirmed to himſelf, as ever you will ſhew your ſelves thankful, for ſo great
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:57538:290"/>
a mercy, as ever you will hold that you have got, or grow to more perfection, and attain that bleſſed Life to which Chriſt hath given you his Miniſters to conduct you, ſee that you ſtick cloſe to a judicious, godly, faithful Miniſtry; And make uſe of them while you have them. Have you ſtrong luſts? or deep wounds in conſcience, or a heavy burthen of doubtings or diſtreſs? ſeek their advice. God will have his own ordinance and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers have the chief inſtrumental hand in your cure. The ſame means oft times in another hand ſhall not do it. Yet I would have you make uſe of all able private Chriſtians help alſo.</p>
               <p>I will tell you the reaſon why our Miniſters have not urged this ſo much upon you, nor ſo plainly acquainted their Congregations with the neceſſity of opening your caſe to your Miniſter, and ſeeking his advice.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some in oppoſition to Popery have gone too far on the other extream; perhaps ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as deeply in neglect, as the Papiſts do in formal exceſs. It is a good ſign that an opinion is true, when it is near to errour. For truth is the very next ſtep to error. The ſmall thred of Truth, runs between the cloſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning extreams of errour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some Miniſters knowing the exceeding greatnes of the burthen, are loth to put
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:57538:291"/>
themſelves upon it. This one Work of giving advice to all that ought to come and open their caſe to us, if our people did but what they ought do for their own ſafety, would it ſelf in great Congregations, be more then preaching every day in the week. What then is all the reſt of the work? And how can one man, yea or five, do this to five thouſand ſouls? And then when it lieth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, the malicious Reproachers rail at the Miniſters, and accuſe the people of unfitneſs to be Church-members; which howſoever there may be ſome cauſe of, yet not ſo much as they ſuggeſt; and that unfitneſs would beſt be cured by the diligence of more La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, which they think to cure by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the few that do remain.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Alſo ſome Miniſters ſeeing that they have more work then they can do already, think themſelves uncapable of more, and therefore that its vain to put their people on it, to ſeek more.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some Miniſters are over-modeſt, and and think it to be unfit to deſire people to open their ſecrets to them; in confeſſing their ſins and corrupt inclinations, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their wants: And indeed any ingenuous man will be backward to pry into the ſecrets of others. But when God hath made it our office under Chriſt to be Phyſicians to the
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:57538:291"/>
ſouls of our People, it is but bloody cruelty to connive at their Pride and Carnal Baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, or Hypocritical Covering of their ſins, and to let them dye of their diſeaſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then we will urge them to diſcloſe it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Some Miniſters are loth to tell People of their duty in this, leſt it ſhould confirm the world in their malicious conceit, that we would be Maſters of Mens Conſciences, and would lord it over them. This is as much folly and cruelty, as if the Maſter and Pilot of the Ship ſhould let the Mariners govern the Ship by the Major Vote, and run all on ſhelves, and drown themſelves and him, and all for fear of being thought Lordly and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical in taking the Government of the Ship upon himſelf, and telling the Mariners that it is their duty to obey him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Moſt godly Miniſters do tell People in General of the Neceſſity of ſuch a Depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on their Teachers, as Learners in the School of Chriſt ſhould have on them that are Uſhers under him the chief Maſter; and they do gladly give advice to thoſe that do ſeek to them: But they do not ſo particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plainly acquaint People with their duty in opening to them the particular ſores of their ſouls.</p>
               <p>It is alſo the Policy of the Devil to make People Believe that their Miniſters are too
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:57538:292"/>
ſtout, and will not ſtoop to a compaſſionate hearing of their caſe: eſpecially if Miniſters carry themſelves ſtrangely at too great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from their People. I would earneſtly intreat all Miniſters therefore to be as fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and as much with their People as they can. Papiſts and other Seducers will inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate themſelves into their familiarity, if we be ſtrange: If you teach them not in their Houſes, theſe will Creep into their Houſes, and lead them Captive. I perſwade others of my Brethren to that which my ſelf am diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled from performing; being by conſtant weakneſs (beſides unavoydable buſineſs) confined to my Chamber. But thoſe that can perform it, will find this a moſt neceſſary and profitable work. And let not poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple believe the Devil, who tels them that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are ſo proud, onely to diſcourage them from ſeeking their advice. Go try them once before you believe it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Remember this, that it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that you once opened your caſe to your Paſtour; but do it as often as Neceſſity urgeth you to call for his advice: though not on every light occaſion. Live in ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on the advice and guidance of your Paſtour (under Chriſt) for your ſoul, as you do on the advice of the Phyſician for your body. Read <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. and let Miniſters read 6, 8, 9.</p>

Many Chriſtians look upon Broken-heartedneſs, and much grieving and weeping for ſin, as if it were the great thing that God Delighteth in and requireth of them: and therefore they bend all their endeavours this way; and are ſtill ſtriving with their hearts to break them more, and wringing their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences to ſqueez out ſome tears; and they think no Sermon, no Prayer, no Meditation ſpeeds ſo well with them, as that which can help them to grieve or weep. I am far from perſwading men againſt Humiliation &amp; Godly ſorrow and tenderneſs of heart: But yet I muſt tell you, that this is a ſore errour that you lay ſo much upon it, and ſo much over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look that great and noble work and ſtate to which it tendeth. Do you think that God hath any Pleaſure in your ſorrows as ſuch? Doth it do him Good to ſee you dejected, afflicted and tormented? Alas, it is onely as
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:57538:293"/>
your ſorrows do kill your ſins, and mortifie your fleſhly luſts, and prepare for your Peace and Joys, that God regards them: Becauſe God doth ſpeak comfortably to troubled drooping ſpirits, and tels them, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in the contrite, and loveth the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and bindeth up the broken-hearted; therefore men miſ-underſtanding him, do think they ſhould do nothing but be ſtill breaking their own hearts: Whereas God ſpeaks it but partly to ſhew his hatred to the proud, and partly to ſhew his tender com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions to the humbled, that they might not be overwhelmed or deſpair. But, O Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, underſtand and conſider, that all your ſorrows are but preparatives to your joys: and that it is a higher and ſweeter work that God cals you to, and would have you ſpend your time and ſtrength in. 1. The firſt part of it is <hi>Love.</hi> A work that is wages to it ſelf. He that knows what it is to live in the Love of God, doth know that Chriſtianity is no tormenting and diſcontented life. 2. The next part is, <hi>Delight in God, and in the Hopes and fore-thoughts of everlaſting Glory.</hi> Pſal. 37.4. <hi>Delight thy ſelf in the Lord, and he ſhall give thee the Deſires of thy heart</hi>: This is it that you ſhould be bending your ſtudies and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours for, that your ſoul might be able to Delight it ſelf in God. 3. The third part
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:57538:294"/>
is Thankfulneſs and Praiſe? Though I ſay not as ſome, that we ſhould be moved by no fears or deſires of the Reward (that is, of God) but act only from Thankfulneſs (as though we had all that we expect alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) yet let me deſire you to take ſpeciall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this Truth; that <hi>Thankfulneſs muſt be the main principle of all Goſpel-Obedience</hi>: And this is not onely true of the Regenerate after faith; but even the wicked themſelves who are called to Repent and Believe, are called to do it <hi>in a glad and Thankful ſenſe of the mercy offered them in Chriſt.</hi> All the world being fallen under Gods wrath and deſerved condemnation, and the Lord Jeſus having become a Sacrifice and Ranſom for all, and ſo brought all from that Legal Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of periſhing which they were under, the Goſpel which brings them the News of this, is glad tidings of great Joy to them; and the very juſtifying Act which they are called to, is, <hi>Thankfully to Accept Chriſt as one that hath already ſatisfied for their ſins, and will ſave them, if they Accept him, and will follow his ſaving Counſel, and uſe his ſaving means</hi>: and the ſaving work which they muſt proceed in, is <hi>Thankfulneſs to obey that Redeemer whom they Believe in.</hi> So that as General Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the very Foundation of the new world and its Government, ſo Thankfulneſs for this
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:57538:294"/>
Redemption is the very life of Juſtifying faith, and Goſpel obedience. And therefore the denyal of this univerſal Redemption (as to the Price and Satisfaction) doth both diſable wicked men (if they receive it) from coming to Chriſt by true Juſtifying Faith (which is, The Thankful Acceptance of Chriſt as he is offered with his benefits;) and this Thankfulneſs muſt be for what he <hi>hath done</hi> in Dying for us, as well as for what he <hi>will do</hi> in pardoning and ſaving us; and it doth diſable all true Believers from Goſpel Grateful Obedience, when ever they loſe the ſight of their Evidences of ſpecial Grace (which, alas, how ordinary is it with them!) For when they cannot have ſpecial Grace in their eye to be Thankful for, according to this doctrine they muſt have none; becauſe they can be no ſurer that Chriſt dyed for them, then they are that themſelves are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Believers and truly ſanctified. And when Thankfulneſs for Chriſts Death and Redemption ceaſeth, Goſpel obedience ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and Legal &amp; ſlaviſh terrors do take place: Though the ſame cannot be ſaid of Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs for ſpecial renewing, pardoning Grace.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth part of the Chriſtian Life, is <hi>Chearful Obedience.</hi> God loveth a chearful Giver, and ſo he doth in every part of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.47. <hi>Becauſe thou ſervedſt not

               <p>Will you now lay all this together, and make it for the time to come your buſineſs? and try whether whether it will not be the trueſt way to comfort? and make your life a bleſſed life? will you make it your end in hearing, reading, praying and meditation to raiſe your ſoul to Delight in God? Will you ſtrive as much to work it to this Delight as ever you did to work it to ſorrow? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly you have more reaſon? and certainly there is more matter of Delight in the face and Love of God, then in all the things in the world beſides.

Have you made conſcience of this great duty according to its excellency and theſe preſſing Commands of God? Have you made Conſcience of the Duties of Praiſe, Thankſgiving and Cheerful Obedience, as much as of Grieving for ſin? Perhaps you will ſay, <hi>I cannot do it for want of Aſſurance: If I knew that I were one of the Righteous, and upright in Heart, then I could be Glad and ſhout for Joy. Anſ.</hi> 1. I have before ſhewed you how you may know that; when you diſcover it in your ſelf, ſee that you make more Conſcience of this duty. 2.

If you would but labour to get this Delight in God, it would help you to Aſſurance: for it would be one of your cleareſt evidences.</p>
               <p>O how the ſubtil enemy diſadvantageth the Goſpel, by the miſapprehenſions and dejected ſpirits of Believers! It is the very Deſign of the ever-bleſſed God, to Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Love and Mercy as highly in the Work of Redemption, as ever he Glorified Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency in the Work of Creation: And he hath purpoſely unhindged the Sabboth which was appointed to Commemorate that work
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:57538:296"/>
of Power in Creation, to the firſt day of the week, <hi>That it might be ſpent as a weekly day of Thanksgiving and Praiſe for the now more Glorious work of Redemption, that Love might not only be equally admired with power, but even go before it.</hi> So that he hath laid the foundation of the Kingdom of Grace in Love and Mercy: and in Love and Mercy hath he framed the whole Structure of the Edifice: and Love and Mercy are written in legible indelible Characters upon every piece: And the whole frame of his Work and Temple-ſervice, hath he ſo compoſed, that all might be the reſounding Eccho's of Love; and the Praiſe and glorious Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Love and Mercy might be the great buſineſs of our ſolemn Aſſemblies: And the new Creation within us, and without us, is ſo ordered, that Love, Thankfulneſs and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, might be both the way and the end. And the Serpent who moſt oppoſeth God where he ſeeketh moſt Glory, eſpecially the Glory of his Grace, doth labour ſo ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to obſcure this Glory, that he hath brought multitudes of poor Chriſtians to have poor low thoughts of the Riches of this Grace: and to ſet every ſin of theirs againſt it, which ſhould but advance it: and even to queſtion the very foundation of the whole building, whether Chriſt hath Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:57538:296"/>
the World by his Sacrifice? yea he puts ſuch a vail over the Glory of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, that men can hardly be brought to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it as Glad tidings, till they firſt have Aſſurance of their own Sanctification! And the very nature of Gods Kingdom is ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, that ſome men think it to be Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Libertiniſm, and others to be Penſive Dejections, and Tormenting Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and fears; and but few know it to be Righteouſneſs and Peace and Joy in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>y Ghoſt: And the very buſineſs of a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians life and Gods ſervice is
rather taken to be Scrupling, Quarrelling and Ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

What can be more contrary to its nature, and to Gods deſign in forming it, then for the Profeſſors to live ſuch dejected and dolorous lives? God calls men from Vexation and Vanity, to high Delights and Peace! And men come to
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:57538:297"/>
God as from Peace and Pleaſure, to Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. All our preaching will do little to win ſouls from Senſuality to Holineſs, while they look upon the ſad lives of the Profeſſors of Holineſs; As it will more deter a ſick man from medling with a Phyſician, to ſee all that he hath had in hand to lie languiſhing in continual pains to their death, then all his words and promiſes will encourage them. O what bleſſed lives might Gods people live, if they underſtood the love of God in the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of mans Redemption; and did addict themſelves to the conſideration and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, and did believingly eye the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Glory, and hereupon did make it the buſineſs of their lives, to Delight their ſouls in him that hath Loved them! And what a wonderful ſucceſs might we expect to our Preaching, if the Holy Delights and Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Obedience of the Saints did preach as clearly to the eyes of the world, as we preach loudly to their ears?</p>
               <p>But fleſh will be fleſh yet a while! and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief will be unbelief! we are all too blame! The Lord forgive our overlooking his Loving kindeneſs, and our diſhonouring the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Goſpel of his Son; and our ſeconding Satan in his contradicting of that Deſign which hath contrived Gods Glory in ſo ſweet a way.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="533" facs="tcp:57538:297"/>And now Chriſtian Reader, let me intreat thee in the name and fear of God, hereafter better to underſtand and practiſe thy Duty. Thy heart is better a thouſand times, in God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow then in Carnal mirth (and by ſuch ſorrows it is often made better, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7.2, 3, 4.) But never take it to be Right till it be Delighting it ſelf in God. When you kneel down in prayer, labour ſo to conceive of God, and beſpeak him that he may be your Delight: ſo do in Hearing and Reading: ſo do in all your Meditations of God: So do in your feaſting on the fleſh and blood of Chriſt at his Supper. Eſpecially improve the happy opportunity of the Lords Day, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you may wholly devote your ſelves to this work. And I adviſe Miniſters and all Chriſts Redeemed ones, that they ſpend more of thoſe days in Praiſe and Thankſgiving, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Commemoration of the whole work of Redemption (and not of Chriſts Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection alone) or elſe they will not anſwer the Inſtitution of the Lord: And that they keep it as the moſt ſolemn day of Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, and be briefer on that day in their Confeſſions and Lamentations, and larger at other times! O that the Congregations of Chriſt through the world were ſo well informed and animated, that the main bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of their ſolemn Aſſemblies on that
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:57538:298"/>
day might be to ſound forth the high Praiſes of their Redeemer; and to begin here the Praiſes of God and the Lamb which they muſt perfect in Heaven, for ever! How ſweet a foretaſte of Heaven would be then in theſe ſolemnities! And truly, let me tell you, my Brethren of the Miniſtry, you ſhould by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Teaching and week-day Sermons ſo further the knowledge of your People, that you might not need to ſpend ſo much of the Lords Day in Sermons as the moſt godly uſe to do: but might beſtow a greater part of it in Pſalms and ſolemn Praiſes to our Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And I could wiſh that the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> to that end would unanimouſly agree on ſome one Tranſlation of the Engliſh Pſalms in meeter, better then that in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe, and if it may be, better then any yet extant (not neglecting the poëtical ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs under pretence of exact tranſlating) or at leaſt to agree on the beſt now extant: (the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters may do well to lead the way) leſt that bleſſed part of Gods ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn worſhip, ſhould be blemiſhed for want either of Reformation or Uniformity. And in my weak judgement, if Hymns and Pſalms of Praiſe were new invented, as fit for the ſtate of the Goſpel-Church and Worſhip (to Laud the Redeemer come in the fleſh, as expreſly as the work of Grace is now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs)
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:57538:298"/>
as <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms were fitted to the former ſtate and infancy of the Church, and more obſcure revelations of the Mediator and his Grace, it would be no ſinful humane Invention or addition; nor any more want warrant, then our Inventing the form and words of every Sermon that we preach, and every prayer that we make, or any Catechiſm or Confeſſion of faith: Nay it may ſeem of ſo great uſefulneſs, as to be next to a Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. (Still provided that we force not any to the uſe of them that through ignorance may ſcruple it.) And if there be any Convenient parcels of the Ancient Church that are fitted to this uſe, they ſhould deſervedly be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred. I do not think I digreſs all this while from the ſcope of my Diſcourſe. For doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs if Gods uſual ſolemn worſhip on the Lords Days were more fitted and directed to a Pleaſant, Delightful, Praiſing way, it would do very much to frame the ſpirits of Chriſtians to Joyfulneſs and Thankfulneſs and Delight in God: then which there is no greater cure for their Doubtful, Penſive, ſelf-tormenting frame. O try this, Chriſtians, at the requeſt of one that is moved by God to importune you to it! God doth pitty you in your ſorrows! but he Delighteth in you when you Delight in him. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.14. compared with <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.17. And if ſin inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:57538:299"/>
and hinder your Delights, believe it, a Chearful Amendment and Obedience is that which will pleaſe God better then your ſelf-tormenting fears: Do not you like that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant better that will go chearfully about your work, and do it as well as he can, accounting it a Recreation, and will endeavour to mend where he hath done amiſs, then him that will at every ſtep fall a crying, <hi>O I am ſo weak I can do nothing as I ſhould.</hi> An hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſenſe of failings you will like; but not that your ſervant ſhould ſit ſtill and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain when he ſhould be working; nor that all your ſervice ſhould be performed with weeping, diſquietneſs and lamentations; You had rather have your ſervant humbly and modeſtly chearfull, and not alway de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, for fear of diſpleaſing you. O how many poor ſouls are overſeen in this! You might eaſily perceive it even by the Devils oppoſition and temptations! He will further you in your ſelf-vexations (when he cannot keep you in ſecurity and preſumption) but in amending he will hinder you with all his might. How oft have I known poor paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Creatures, that would vex and rage in anger, and break out in unſeemly language, to the diſquieting of all about them; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that would drop into other the like ſins, and when they have done, lament it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:57538:299"/>
themſelves; and yet would not ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a reſolute and chearful Reformation! Nay, if you do but reprove them for any ſin, they will ſooner ſay, <hi>If I be ſo bad, God will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn me for an Hypocrite</hi>; and ſo lye down in diſquietneſs and diſtreſs; then they will ſay, <hi>I ſee my ſin, and
I reſolve to reſiſt it, and I pray you warn me of it, and help me to watch againſt it.</hi> So that they would bring us to this paſs, that either we muſt let them alone with their ſins for fear of Tormenting them, or elſe we muſt cauſe them to lye down in terrours. Alas, poor miſtaken ſouls! It is neither of theſe that God cals for! Will you do any thing ſave what you ſhould do? Muſt you needs be eſteemed either Innocent, or Hypocrites, or ſuch as ſhall be damned? The thing that God would have, is this; That you would be glad that you ſee your fault, and thank him that ſheweth it you, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvedly do your beſt to amend it, and this in faith and chearful confidence in Chriſt, flying to his Spirit for help and victory. Will you pleaſe the Devil ſo far, and ſo far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the gracious way of Chriſt, as that you will needs either ſin ſtill, or Deſpair? Is there not a middle between theſe two? to wit, Chearful Amendment? Remember that it is not your Vexation or Deſpair, but your Obedience and Peace that God deſireth
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:57538:300"/>
That life is moſt Pleaſing to him, which is moſt ſafe and ſweet to you.</p>
               <p>If you ſay ſtill, You cannot Delight in God: I ſay again; <hi>Do but acknowledge it the great work that God requireth of you, and make it your daily aim, and care, and buſineſs, and then you will more eaſily and certainly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it.</hi> But while you know not your work, or ſo far miſtake it, as to think it conſiſteth more in ſorrows and fears; and never endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in your Duties or Meditations to raiſe your ſoul to a Delight in God, but rather to caſt down your ſelf with ſtill poaring on your miſeries, no wonder then if you be a ſtranger to this life of holy Delight!</p>
