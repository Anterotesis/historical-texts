            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the Parlament of the COMMON-WEALTH of ENGLAND, SCOTLAND and IRELAND.</head>
            <head type="sub">
               <hi>The humble Petition of</hi> Edward Dendy.</head>
            <opener>SHEWETH,</opener>
            <p>THat upon <hi>Saturday</hi> the 30. of <hi>July</hi> 1653. the Parlament then ſitting they were pleaſed to Order, That your Honours Petitioner ſhould immediately take care of the Priſon and Priſoners of the Upper Bench, and have the like charge of, and power over the Priſoners and Officers there, as the Marſhal of the ſaid Upper Bench at any time had or ought to have had.</p>
            <p>That in obedience to the ſaid Order of Parlament, your Honours Petitioner accordingly repaired thither, and the day following, being <hi>Munday,</hi> gave the Parlament an Account of the Condition of the ſaid Priſon, and particularly of the place called the Rules of the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Bench Priſon, where (for want of Room in the Priſon houſes) Priſoners are lodged, and where your Petitioner found that nothing was of force to keep the Priſoners there lodged within their bounds, but the ſecurities which they uſually gave to the Marſhall of the ſaid Priſon; which ſecurities being refuſed ro be delivered to your Petitioner, your Honours Petitioner thereupon declared to the Parlament, That he had no more power over the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners lying in the Rules, than he had of the Birds in the air; and therefore beſought the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament, that he might not ſtand charged with that Truſt, which your Petitioner never ſought, and being impoſed upon him, was not able to give an Accompt of.</p>
            <p>That the Parlament thereupon (being Munday the firſt of <hi>Auguſt)</hi> Ordered, That the Priſoners of the Upper Bench ſhould continue in the ſame places as formerly till further or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; by which Order your Petitioner ſuppoſed himſelf indempnifyed. Nevertheleſs, ſince the diſſolution of the late Parlament, your Petitioner hath been ſued from all points of the Compaſs for the eſcape of Priſoners lying in the Rules, though your Honours Petitioner was not able to ſecure them for the reaſon aforeſaid; neither could your Petitioner receive ſo much as a Liſt of the ſaid Priſoners names, till about a moneth after your Petitioner had been there.</p>
            <p>That your Petitioner for the better looking to the Priſoners in the Priſon houſes did (as impowred by the Parlament) make choice of ſeveral ſervants to the number of twenty (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fewer than the Marſhall uſually imployed) who continually attended, often watching whole nights; and with much faithfulneſs and diligence diſcharged the ſaid truſt for about the ſpace of eight moneths, during which time theſe poor men received not one penny of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary, becauſe your Petitioner received not the benefit of Chamber Rents (the chief profits of the place) which the Priſoners refuſed to pay till further order of the Houſe, nor any other way ſo much as your Petitioner expended in that ſervice; although according to the known Maxim, <hi>Qui ſentit onus, ſentire debet commodum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore your Honours Petitioner with all humble earneſtneſs prays, That your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors will be pleaſed to put on bowels of ſpeedy Compaſſion for the relief of your Petitioners poor Servants, who, maintaining themſelves at their own charge for ſo long time together, in the ſervice of the Parlament, have thereby reduced themſelves and families to ſo great need and miſery, as your Petitioner wants words to expreſs the ſadneſs of their condition.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, in as much as your Honours Petitioner never ſought the ſaid place; and yet hath undergon great charge and trouble in obeying the Parlament:</p>
            <p>Your Petitioner moſt humbly prayes, that according to your Honours juſtice he may be relieved from all further troubles, arreſts, and ſuits at Law, for the eſcape of Priſoners, which, as your Petitioner hath humbly declared, was impoſſible for him to ſecure; and to this end your Petitioner humbly prays that your Honours will be pleaſed to grant your Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner an Act of Indempnity, and that your Honours will permit your Petitioner, with the advice of his Council to draw the ſaid Act; which your Petitioner humbly ſubmits to your Honours conſideration.</p>
            <closer>
               <signed>And your Petitioner (as in duty bound) ſhall pray.
Edward Dendy.</signed>
