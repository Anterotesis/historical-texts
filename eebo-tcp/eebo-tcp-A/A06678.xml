            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Aint <hi>Iohn Chryſoſtom</hi> (most renowmed Queene) ſaith in one of his Homilies of the praiſe of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that ſuch is the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of falſehood, that of it ſelfe it commeth to naught; and on the contrarie, that truth is knit togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſuch ſtrength, that wel it may be aſſaulted, but never co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered: and that deceit yeeldeth unto hir, as having no power to reſiſt hirs. I remember to haue read in the 3. booke of <hi>Eſdras;</hi> being questioned before <hi>Darius</hi> king <note place="margin">Eſdras 4.</note> of Perſia, what might be the thing of greateſt ſtrength, it was agreed and concluded, that it was truth; which not onely overcommeth thoſe things that time goeth on conſuming, but triumpheth alſo over time it ſelfe: falſe opinion, for a while, may beare authoritie, but at length truth prevaileth: whoſe nature is woonderfull, for where moſt force is oppoſed againſt hir, there becommeth ſhe moſt ſtrongeſt, and the more they ſtrive to throwe hir downe to the bottome, and to bury hir in the bottomleſſe pit of oblivion, the more ſhe aſcendeth aloft, and ſhewes hirſelfe in the higheſt: even as the oyle, though it be put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the water, yet ſtraight commeth above it, ſo is truth, for in caſe men would put it under falſhood, yet it ſhal ariſe to the higheſt place, for it abideth not to lie long in covert. For even as a comet appeer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for a ſeaſon, in which it ſheweth ſome brightnes, but yet endureth not long, bicauſe though it ſeeme a ſtar, yet is none: even ſo is deceit, though it may be beleeved for a time, by a falſe apparance of light, yet
<pb facs="tcp:9505:4"/>
at length it ſhall vaniſh and conſume away, when as truth ſhal endure to the end. Truth is a thing ſo pretious and belooved of God, that al they who ſeeke to excell in vertue, do preferre hir before treaſure, chooſing to be behinde in wealth, to go forward with truth: And fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallie they eſteeme the hazarding of their life (which ſoone paſſeth awaie) for wel imploied, for the love of truth which abideth for ever. <hi>David,</hi> preferring truth before al worldly matters, ſaith: <hi>Take not ô Lord thy truth out of my mouth.</hi> In ancient hiſtories we read <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> that <hi>Simandrus</hi> prince of Egypt, commanded his picture to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graved on his tombe, and a jewell on his breast, with his eies fixed thereon, which jewell was the image of truth, as recordeth <hi>Diodor. Sicul. Elianus</hi> ſaith, that Pithagoras called truth a thing divine. And of the ſame <hi>Pitha.</hi> it is written, that he ſaid, that for a man to make himſelfe a God, he ought to ſpeake the truth. Truth is a centre where vertues repoſe, the north ſtar of the vertuous, the balme of the wounded, and finally it is the butte whereat many ſhoote, and the white that fewe do hitte. All theſe I bring (renowmed Queene) that they who ſhall reade my anſwere may knowe (that in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe I make of the truth, which hapned in both Navies) that my intent is to deale in truth and not to flatter your Majeſty, you being an enimy to adulation: and I knowing it to be as far from the princely nature of your Majeſtie to heare it, as from mine, to write it. And that you have in memorie the ſaieng of S. <hi>Hierome;</hi> that he that would be accounted woorthy of true praiſe, ſhould not ſeek it of men.

Theſe and many ſuch perfect vertues of your Majestie, have wrought in me ſuch love, that I have bin verie deſirous to do you ſome ſervice, &amp; determining to effectuat theſe my deſires, which long I have bread in my breast, I purpoſed to offer to your Majeſty this my anſwer, but I chanced to meet with a new fear, which made me doubt. For perceiving it not, to deſerve to appeer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo excellent a Queene: I ſtood in ſuſpence what to do, being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into many and ſundrie thoughts, as having experience that bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes without deliberation, most commonly cauſeth repentance; At length the one and the other conſiderations felt &amp; waied togither, I found love, to overcharge and waie downe reſpect. Thorow which I determined to dedicate it to your Majeſtie, thereby as well to ſhewe the deſire I have to ſerve you, as alſo that this ſhort anſwer and poore woorke, belonging to your Majeſtie, may receive that auctoritie, which it cannot have in being mine, and the darke miſt which it hath on my part, may be baniſhed by the reſplendent ſhining, that it ſhall receive from your Majestie, whoſe Royall perſon the Lord Almightie preſerve and proſper in his bleſſed ſervice,</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Marvell good Sir, to ſee a man of ſo noble a linage, and no leſſe indued with the gifts of nature than others, ſhould have your eares ſo opened to heare the rumors and lies, which the ſcoffing &amp; gibing flatterers do write you: and I woonder not ſo much in that you credit them, as at the ſpeede wherewith your Honor doth write them. Truly I am ſorie for it. Looke into your ſelfe, and you ſhall ſee, that they who write you ſuch novelties, do but fill your ſides with ſharp darts. Your Honor writeth to Spaine, that it is a matter moſt true, that the Lord high Admirall of England, was come, running away with 25. or 26. ſhips unto London, and that he had loſt his ſhip that was Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and that this was written for a matter moſt certaine, by perſons of credit from London. I knowe not what men of credit they ſhould be, that wrote a matter of ſo great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit. But at leaſtwiſe this I know, that if your Honor were in London, we might ſing unto you the ſong of Don <hi>Pedro: More enimies than friends have compaſſed his perſon.</hi> For in truth I know not ſo much as one in that citie, that is your friend. You ſaie farther in your letter, that the Admirall was loſt; hardly may a ſhip be loſt that had for hir governor ſo noble a captain, as is, that noble gentleman my L. <hi>Charles Howard;</hi> who, when fortune ſhould haue bin ſo wholy his enimie would rather have choſen to dy than flie. But both the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral and his ſhip that was Admirall, entred both togither (as togither they erſt went forth) into the river of London, triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phing in the victorie, that the Lord vouchſafed to give them, unto whom they yeeld all praiſe and thanks. Your Honor ſaith farther, that <hi>Drake</hi> is priſoner: I demand by whom? Know you not that from the <note n="*" place="margin">The word, <hi>Drago</hi> which ſignifieth a Drago<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, made the Author thus to run upon <hi>Draque,</hi> whom the Spaniards doo not let to call alſo <hi>Drago.</hi>

and the reſt of the beaſts tremble? If then this be ſo, who ſhould he be, that ſhould take <hi>Drake,</hi> that the venome and poiſon of his ſword, bereft him not of his life? It was then an unbridled boldnes in him that wrote your Honor this matter. Concerning which, read a ſhort letter, which I make in anſwer of that of <hi>Diego Perez</hi> poſtmaſter of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gronio,</hi> and therin (although I deale ſoftly with him) you may ſee, who <hi>Drake</hi> is, and what he hath done in the Indies and in Spaine, and chawing it in the cud, you ſhall know ſome part of his valor. Your honor ſaith, that if he be not priſoner he is ſlaine, in theſe words. <hi>Drake is either taken or dead.</hi> The Ginets in Spaine deliver themſelves flieng and hurt the more, ſo that they do more harme flieng then aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulting, but on the ſea it is contrary. For if his enimie fled from him, who tooke him or ſlue him? If your Honor in ſaieng <hi>Drake is priſoner or dead,</hi> had added, he is priſoner to hir Majeſtie; then would I be ſilent, for that he is ſo loyall a ſubiect unto hir, that, though free, yet alwaies in hir pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſacrificed day and night to do hir ſervice, and for and in all to accompliſh hir will. And in ſaieng dead, had your Honor named the diſeaſe whereof he died, we would ſaie that the howre were come, wherein the Lord almighty had called him unto himſelfe: but finally he is both free and alive, and as loyall a vaſſall to hir Majeſtie as ever. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your Honor ſaith, that, <hi>the Queene commanded that there ſhould be no talke of hir Navie:</hi> giving thereby to underſtand, that it was in regard of the great dammage hir ſaid Navie had received. She commanded no ſuch matter; but had ſhe ſo commanded, it had bin a thing both holie and iuſt, for as ſhe is an enimie to all vaine-glorie, even ſo the ſpoiles of hir victorie and triumph, ſhe offered it all to God, from whom it came. And if, for not receiving theſe letters ſo plentie as at other times, you gathered, that it was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by hir Majeſtie, that they ſhould not write, you gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red amiſſe, for the cauſe was no other, but that for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall repairing of all people to give thanks to God (at the Churches) from whom all their good proceeded, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came unmindful of all worldly affaires.

this celebration of victorie and that which was uſed in Spaine, where in ſteed of ſinging Pſalmes and praiſes unto God, they made fire and ſports, and blinde men in open places, pirkt up, upon fiſhmongers ſtals, ſoong ſongs, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the people beleeve that they were victors: <hi>the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie where of is true.</hi> Your letter relates farther, <hi>that hir Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie had 30000. men betweene Dover and Margate, rawe ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,</hi> heer to I anſwere; that this ballance runneth too faſt: for that hir Majeſties campe was hard by Tylberrie, in the province of Eſſex, a far different place from Dover &amp; Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate. And that hir Majeſtie was with them, it was ſo; and marke your Honor what I ſaie, that the ſight of <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> in his hoaſt, wrought not ſo great effect, as did the ſight of hir Majeſtie amongſt hirs; for ſhe being a valiant <hi>Mars,</hi> and ſhewing hir ſelfe a moſt expert warrior, clad hir ſoldiers with the webs and fels of <hi>Hercules,</hi> where there was not any that eſteemed himſelfe in leſſe than a <hi>Hanniball</hi> or a <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vola:</hi> whereunto they were invited, by the ſight of a tender woman, being the firſt that put hirſelfe to ſuch a travell, for Chriſtendome, the peace of hir countrie, and for the qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnes of hir ſubiects. And who ſo had ſeene hir Majeſtie, I ſay not, that he ſhould have ſeene an angrie <hi>Mars,</hi> a <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> or <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> for all this is winde in compariſon of hir: But he ſhould have ſeene a <hi>Debora,</hi> a <hi>Heſter,</hi> a <hi>Ruth,</hi> and a <hi>Iudith,</hi> and finally he ſhould have ſeene a Valour ſecond to none. You ſaid farther in your letter, <hi>that hir Majestie went to and from the Campe, bicauſe the Catholikes had made a mutinie.</hi> Your Honor knowes that it is an old Proverbe, <hi>that when you ſee your neighbours beard a ſhaving, prepare yours to the waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baſen.</hi> And in this countrie they remember what the Goſpell ſaith, <hi>Everie kingdome divided against it ſelfe, ſhall be</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luke 11.</note> 
               <hi>deſolate.</hi> And the experience heereof, they finde in their neighbors the french men, that for not having peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, their poore kingdome is deſtroyed. Concerning this matter I have heard it queſtioned in this countrie, by ſome perſons of no baſe calling, who ſay plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that while your Honor was heer, they never had any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect quietnes amongſt them, and ſince your departure they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:9505:7"/>
have had no broyles nor <note n="*" place="margin">Save ſuch as he left kindled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> ſtrife: and it may be, that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of matters in ſuch ſort in the kingdome of Fraunce, ſo troubled and kindled as they are, that it is by reaſon your Honor is there, and that your abſence might quench ſo great a fire. You ſaie farther in your letter, <hi>that there was none other ſhip brought hither but that of Don Pedro de Valdes.</hi> Heerin is the publiſhing of victorie gainſaid, and loſſe, evident; the which ſhip, had your Armada bin victors, they had not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be brought hither, neither was <hi>Don Pedro de Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> ſo ill a ſoldier, nor for ſo little, as to ſuffer himſelfe to be taken by a people alreadie overcome, and running awaie; neither the ſoldiers which he had with him (which were fower hundreth at leaſt) of leſſe valor then the reſt of thoſe of the Armada, they were rather everie man to conquere a kingdome, and to give a thouſand victories. But the thriſe noble Lord, high Admirall, not flieng, but aſſaulting, and he the captive or ſlaine <hi>Drake,</hi> his fetters broken, and riſen from death; fettered the conquerers, and bereaved their life, who lived a little before. In concluſion there were no more ſhips brought into England but that of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> as for the reſt (for a better demonſtration of the truth) they were contented that their friends and neighbors ſhould participate with them; and ſo they left a Galleaſſe at Callis, wherein amongſt others, was ſlaine <hi>Don Hugo de Moncada,</hi> and <hi>Don Georje Manrique,</hi> (being <hi>Veedor Generall)</hi> eſcaped to carrie the true relation thereof unto Spaine. And the Saint Matthew, and S. Philip, being two moſt ſtrong Gallions, were carried to Fluſhing, out of one of the which eſcaped <hi>Don Franciſco de Toledo,</hi> with ſixe and thirtie ſoldiers, which were the remainder of fower or five hundreth, which he had with him: and in the other was taken <hi>Don Diego Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentel,</hi> with all his men ſave thoſe that were ſlaine, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſhips (by divine providence) by force of wind and ſea, were deſtroied upon the coaſt of Ireland. If I have bin large in anſwering your Honor, the occaſion excuſeth me; and the matter which is wider then the ſea, makes me thinke to be woorthy reprehenſion for being ſo ſhort. Yet notwithſtanding, time, which gave an end to theſe my wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſome
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:9505:8"/>
reaſonings, ſeemed to call upon me to paſſe on far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And having caſt about, I fell into conſideration with my ſelfe, what occaſion I might have to enlarge farther, ſith (though briefely) I had anſwered to the letter: and I perceived that the lawe of love, and Chriſtianitie in the Lord, did binde me to admoniſh you like a true neighbor. The lawe of love in Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Love your enimies.</hi> And this <note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> ſaid Chriſt after that he had ſaid, <hi>Yee have heard, that it hath bin ſaid, thou ſhalt love thy friend and hate thy enimie;</hi> and he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth on ſaieng, <hi>and do good to them that hate you.</hi> There is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lawe which ſaith: <hi>Yee ſhall not render ill for ill, but good for evill.</hi> Theſe and ſuch other, ſacred words do binde me to love your Honor: but not your condition &amp; proceedings, for if I ſhould have reſpect thereunto, I ſhould followe the lawe of old, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy friend, and hate thy enimie;</hi> and I ſhould be more bound to hate then love you. But for that the Goſpel commandeth me, <hi>To do good to thoſe that hurt me, and to render good for evill, and to love my enimies:</hi> I will do both the one and the other, ſo that I will both love, and do you good. I meane not to do you good, by beſtowing trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures upon you, bicauſe I have them not, but I wil give you of that, which bookes have given me, which are certaine counſailes, by meane whereof, it may be, you ſhall live leſſe troubleſome, and not ſo much abhord: wherſoever I come I heare, that your Honor is an enimie to peace, &amp; unquiet. To the firſt I anſwere, that <hi>Et ex conſequenti,</hi> you are an eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to God. When Chriſt our Redeemer departed from his diſciples, amongſt other gifts which he gave them, and free mercies beſtowed upon them, he gave them his peace, and it was neither the peace of the world, nor that of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, for theſe are peaces of death and damnation, unwoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily called peace, but ſuch a peace as was a pledge of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſednes. <hi>Bleſſed are the peace-makers,</hi> ſaith the Goſpell. I might alleage manie places to ſhew, how gratefull that peace is <note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> unto God, and they that love it, and how he abhorreth the contemners thereof, and ſo I admoniſh your Honor to cloath your ſelfe with peace, and let it be that of Chriſt which ſaveth, and not that of Iudas which betraieth, nor
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:9505:8"/>
that of the world which killeth. To the ſecond, that I am informed you are troubleſome, I anſwere, that if for the firſt you are an enimie to God, that by this you are the like unto Heaven; and for confirmation of this truth, you muſt underſtand, that of divers ſences, divers are the objects. So that (according to <hi>Ariſtotle)</hi> one ſence cannot judge direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Aristotle.</note> of the object of an other ſence, for the taſte judgeth not of the colour, nor the ſight of the taſte, rather beholding Sugar, we judge it to be white, and taſting it, we judge it to be ſweete. So they that have the earth for object cannot judge well of Heaven, and they who live according to the fleſh, comprehend not the ſweetnes of the ſpirit, &amp; they that go intangled in the affaires of the world and ſeated in their wiles, attaine not the delectation of ſpirituall repoſe. Such is your Honor, who being entred into the laberinth of the reſtleſſe labors of life, you cannot make an end to knowe the ſweetnes of the tranquillitie of life it ſelfe. Open your eies, and behold that much ſelfe truſt groweth not but of ſmall knowledge, and you ſhall ſee, that the firſt degree for a man to know little, is, to ſuppoſe that he knoweth much. I hold that for a moſt certaintie, which Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith, <note place="margin">Hierom.</note> that the acknowledging of imperfection, is, a certaine kind of perfection in a man: regard that it is not a ſmall matter for a man to know, that he knoweth nothing. And if your Honor knew this of your ſelfe, you would become peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and live a quiet life, and ſo be accounted quiet. Where the river goeth ſtilleſt, there hath it moſt water, and is dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt; and where it maketh moſt noiſe, there hath it leaſt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: ſo the quiet and ſtill man is of great depth, and is to be holden and accounted of greatly; and he that prates much is he that doth leaſt, for the ignorant have great ſound, and ſmall depth. The wiſe are free from paſſions, far from mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtations, and full of tranquillitie. So then, to have a ſhare in heaven, a good life on earth, and to be accounted wiſe, it is to be quiet, and a peace-maker. And now let the former turmoiles ſuffice, and the hurt that you have already done unto Spaine by your unquietnes, giving hir ſo ill counſell, making hir to leeſe Armada, treaſure, munition, credit and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:9505:9"/>
reputation; and that which is more to be lamented, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands of ſoules: for verily Spaine ſhould have been full both of men and monie, were it not for ſo long and coſtly wars, and altogither unprofitable. Whereby it had been better for thee, ô Spaine, to have contented thee with thy towe, than to have deſired the hollands of Flanders, where there is ſcant a ſpan of earth, that hath not been wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with the blood of thy Spaniards. And to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented thee with thy pots of clay, rather than to have luſted for the ſilver diſhes of Engliſh men, which are ſo hardly gotten. I thought alſo heere to advertiſe you more at large, than I did in my anſwer to your letter, concerning the few friends which heer you have, rather I put you out of doubt, that you are to make no account of them, no, not to thinke that you have a friend in London: to proove this to be true, I wil availe my ſelfe with that ſaieng of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaith, that <hi>Charitie wel ordred, muſt begin in himſelfe.</hi> If then this be ſo, who would you have to be ſuch a friend to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, that he ſhould ceaſe to bee a friend to himſelfe, his wife, children, and ſubſtance. May you bee perſuaded that your friendes heere, ſhoulde open their doores to their enimies, to the end to rob them of their goodes? for in very truth, not one in this kingdome (though he had a ſafe conduct from your Honor) ſhould have eſcaped from being robbed, ſlaine, or diſhonored. If this then be true, how can you hope for any friends heer? Rather, in truth, if you would conſider and open your eies, you ſhall ſee that all are your mortall enimies. If it be the dutie of a friend to deale trulie, and he that writes you moſt newes, doth notſo, then have you heere no friend. As alſo, he is no friend, that requireth of his friend, what is unjuſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, and this the verie Gentiles underſtood, for ſo <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Tullius</hi> teacheth, even as I ſpeake it, in his booke of <note place="margin">Mar. Tu. Pericles.</note> Friendſhip, and before him <hi>Pericles</hi> taught the ſame, when a certaine friend requeſted him to affirme a lie for him and that with an oth, he anſwered him ſaieng: It is lawful to be a friend, yet no farther than the altar. And ſo recordeth <note place="margin">Plutarch. Aul. Gel. Bruſon.</note> 
               <hi>Plutarch, Aulus Gellius,</hi> and <hi>Bruſon: Pericles</hi> ment, that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:9505:9"/>
friendſhip was good, and woorthie to be conſerved, with gifts given and received, but that it ſhould be in ſuch ſort that it ſhould not be againſt the good liking of God. For friends ought not to impugne religion, nor paſſe the limits of conſcience: friends are bound to do one for another, ſo that their good works paſſe not the bounds of reaſon, nor the limits of vertue. <hi>Publius Rutilius</hi> denied a certaine friend a matter, bicauſe it was unjuſt, which made his friend to <note place="margin">Publius Rutilius.</note> ſay; Why ſhould I account of thy friendſhip, if thou wilt not do as I requeſt thee? And <hi>Rutilius</hi> replied: But why ſhould I make account of thine, ſith thou requeſteſt me that which I ought not to do? Authors heerof are <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> in his ſixt booke, and <hi>Bruſonius</hi> in his firſt. Sith therefore your Honor demandeth unjuſt things of Engliſh men, as are, to admit entrance to their enimies, and to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves to be robbed, diſhonored, maſſacred, and to be traitors to their Soveraigne: how can you challenge them for your friends? True friends ought to be juſt, and to love the ſoules of their friends better than their bodies; to be more affectionate to their ſoules than to their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and more to their conſciences than to their lives. To do any good deede to a friend, is alſo the office of a friend; even as at the play of tenniſe, it is not ynough to reach the ball in the aire, but alſo to ſtrike him, and ſend it from whence it came: in like ſort in friendſhip, it is not for one friend alwaies to expect good turns of the other, but alſo to indevor to requite it: there ſhould never be a <hi>(take)</hi> without a <hi>(regive:)</hi> and good deeds muſt reſult from both parts full of love. And ſith your Honor will take and not give (except it be death and diſhonor) we will not accept you for a friend. You have men that are altogither ſand without lime, all words and no deeds; and in England they account your Honor for one of the number: from which England and your pretended friends therin, remoove your bloodie hand, ſo ſhall you live more in quiet and reſt, and then ſhall you have friends indeede: and one that ſo mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to be your friend, ſince the victorie that this kingdom atchived againſt the Spaniſh Armada (or better to ſay, that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:9505:10"/>
God gave them) made this Sonet in praiſe of the noblenes of this kingdome, wherein are many <hi>Caeſars</hi> and <hi>Pompeies,</hi> unto which valor and magnanimitie, they are ſtirred up by the love of hir Majeſtie their Queene: a matter well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to your Honor, inſomuch that by none of your practiſes you have prevailed to pervert them.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hree or fower times I laid aſide my pen, at ſuch time <hi>(Sen<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>or Gamarra)</hi> as I purpoſed to anſwer your blurs: for I thought it a matter very improper to anſwer to a thing ſo devoid of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and truth, and that, that was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, which time it ſelfe hath long ſince anſwered. But ſeeing your eſtate deſerves no leſſe, I could not excuſe my ſelfe: but firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from me this counſell for another time; and is, that you ſhew not your ſelfe ſo very a marchant; for if it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for a marchant to lie in his priſes, yet is it not, to lie in his writings; and you would be ſo wholy a marchant, that you have plaied bankrout with truth. It ſeemeth unto me, that you being a marchant of cloth, will become a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant of wines; and proclaiming wine, you ſell vineger, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving very cheape, that which hath coſt you ſo deere: and you ſell victorie, being no victor; and you promiſé palme, yours being the nettle. You ſay in your letter, that the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Armada woon 46. ſhips, 20. ſoonke, and 26. taken, and that this was in <hi>Luxaten</hi> a port in Scotland. You take an ill courſe for a Chronicler; for the Engliſh Navie was not at al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo far as Scotland, neither did my Lord high Admiral break the order which he had of hir Majeſtie, which was, not to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:9505:11"/>
leave hir owne ports ungarded: and in this you may know the humilitie of the Queenes Majeſtie, in that ſhe would not put hir ſelfe ſo much to offend, as to defend hir owne; and therefore that befel hir, which Saint <hi>Iames</hi> mentioneth in his fourth chapter; <hi>God reſisteth the proud, and giveth his</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iam. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>grace to the humble:</hi> and ſo as God ſaw the humilitie of his ſervant <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> he raiſed hir up, and gave hir the victorie over hir enimies. The pride of a <hi>Pharao</hi> in Egypt, God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded <note place="margin">Exod. 14.</note> by the waters of the red ſea, as in <hi>Exodus.</hi> And the pride of your hautie Armada hath he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>founded in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean ſea. God is he that taketh in hand the cauſe of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. This then being true, you have ſmall reaſon to ſay, that you ſoonke and tooke ſo many ſhips. Though when the Egyptians were drowned, there eſcaped none to carrie newes therof unto Egypt; there are ſome gone from hence, which have carried the newes of the reſt unto Spaine, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by yours will be thought of ſmall moment. I purpoſe not heere to give you a particular account of the ſhips, which the Engliſh Armada tooke and ſoonke, nor of thoſe which have periſhed in Ireland, neither the number of priſoners and ſlaine; bicauſe it is the doings of the Lord &amp; his works, and from him commeth all goodnes, on whoſe divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie this whole kingdome hath put and laid his truſt, and to him alone do they give the glorie of this victorie, ſinging to him Pſalmes and Hymnes, as they did in the citie of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thulia, after the beheading of <hi>Holofernes.</hi> So, to conclude, <note place="margin">Judith 16.</note> neither went the Engliſh Armada into Scotland, neither brake they the order of their roial Soveraigne the Queenes Majeſtie, rather they viſited their owne ports, gathering (as it were) under their wings their ſcattering chickens. This (friend <hi>Iohn Gamarra)</hi> is true, and ſith you knew it not at the beginning, when firſt you became an Hiſtoriographer, meddle not hence forward any more in that office (for it is for you a matter too high) that it befall you not, as unto <hi>Icarus,</hi> and <hi>Phaeton,</hi> and occupie your ſelfe in waight and meaſures, Burſe affaires, and Caſh bookes; and if you be wearie of this, then were it beſt for you to become a crier of figs about the ſtreets; or a cobler, or matmaker, for this

                  <hi>him that loveth thee, then the falſe kiſſes of him that abhorreth thee:</hi> You would not take in ill part my maner of ſpeech. But for that I know you to be ſound and a friend of truth, I will briefely informe you of the certaintie, and ſuch as is devoid of doubt. For though time hath ſufficiently ſhewed thee the contrarie, of that whereunto thou firmedſt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as you are maſſie, ſound, and waightie, it ſhall be well to recount it you, yea and with hammer and naile to beate it into your head. The truth then is, that aſſoone as it was knowne in this kingdome of the comming of the Spaniſh Armada, the noble Lord <hi>Charles Howard,</hi> (Lord high Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,) went foorth with his navie, who reparted the ſaide into ſundry ſquadrons (according as time and place affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) at times making two ſquadrons, and then three, and more or leſſe, as was fitteſt for the purpoſe, to fight and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves, without cumbring one another: In this order they went defending their ports, wherein they not onely obſerved hir Majeſties order, but there was alſo ſeen the valor in fight, of the L. high Admirall, who is a man not onely ſufficient to rule and governe ſuch a Navie as this of England is, but if all the Chriſtian princes of the worlde ſhould joine, &amp; make by a loving union, an Armada againſt the Infidels, they might well truſt and commit the ſame to his Honors government, and I doubt that there ſhall be any found more woorthy. For though it be true that there are ſome to be found in Chriſtendome moſt fit for ſuch a charge, yet none ſo much nor repleat with ſo many ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; for what is reparted amongſt others, is wholie in him. You have in the world ſoldiers ripe in giving counſell, others to fight and others to governe, &amp;c. But manie of theſe are gameſtars, backbiters, blaſphemers, &amp; ill Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. But in the Lord Admirall, is the feare of God, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie, ſcience, government, knowledge, practiſe, policie, juſtice, forecaſt, agilitie, aſſaulting, perſeverance, courage, chollor, patience and ſuffering, with many other graces. Theſe are things not found in all men. So that then, the

Engliſh Armada to be governed as is ſaid, was by the order of hir Majeſtie, and the performance and induſtrie of this Lord. Obſerving this order, the Duke of Medina durſt not aſſault the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, dreading the hurt which might enſue: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding his Armada was more puiſſant, greater ſhips, ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and more in number &amp; men, though (I beleeve) not in Artillery.

To this I anſwer, that a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall doth more in governing and conſerving then in fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and I do not onely thus anſwer you, but I tell thee, that <hi>Drake</hi> both governeth, conſerveth and fighteth, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:9505:15"/>
knoweth how to prevent. You ſay farther in your letter, <hi>that the Spaniſh Armada gave chaſe to the Engliſh, unto Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpurge.</hi> To this I anſwer you nothing, bicauſe the ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor in France doth, and ſets downe the contrarie, calling the place <hi>Trapena Euxaten:</hi> and <hi>Iuan de Gamarra,</hi> gaine-ſaith the ambaſſador, calling it <hi>Luxaten:</hi> and <hi>Pedro de Alva,</hi> gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaith him, being his neighbor of Roane, no great diſtance from Andwarp, and ſaith that the port is called Triffla: at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone me theſe meaſures. It is a great deſperatenes of Spaine, to conſent a matter to be imprinted ſo apparant fabulous. But Spaine will anſwer me and ſaie, that none of theſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors diſagree in calling the port by ſuch ſundrie names (as are Abſpurge, Trapena, Euxaten, Luxaten, Triffla) and that though there be a difference in the names, yet that there is none in the place, and ſignification, and that the writers are of ſundrie nations and ſo ſpeake with ſundrie toongs, &amp; everie one rather uſeth his mother toong, then a ſtrange language, for ſome are Arabians, others Hebrewes, others Galileans, others Parthians, and Caldees, and everie one named the port in his owne language. You (Sen<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>or poſtma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter) whoſe ſpeech is Arabian, call it Abſpurge; the ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador, who is a Galilean, Parthian, and Meede, ſaith <hi>Trape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Euxaten: Gamarra,</hi> is a Caldean (though he be indeed a Burgales) and ſaith <hi>Luxaten; Pedro de Alva</hi> who is a Iewe, ſaith <hi>Triffla.</hi> To this looſe anſwere of Spaine, I will anſwer, and rid them of doubt, giving them to underſtand, that as well in the place, as the ſignification and name, there is in all, difference and error. For why Abſpurge, which <hi>Diego Perez</hi> writeth ſhould be called Ausburgo, which is in Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie, and not in Scotland; Luxaten, which <hi>Gamarra</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, is called Newcaſtell, and is no port of Scotland, but of England: Triffla, which <hi>Pedro de Alva</hi> nameth, is called Tasfill, and is hard by the Brill: Trapena, or Euxaten, which the ambaſſador rehearſeth, Trapena is called Traport, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle port of France hard by Deepe, (if he will not have it to be Trapena in Levante) And Euxaten is the ſaid Newcaſtel a port in England. Let us ſee then whether the ſhips were Angelicall ſpirits, to be at one inſtant in ſundrie and divers
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:9505:16"/>
places, there being diſtance off many leagues one from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; ſo heereby I proove it manifeſt, that the errour is both in the name and place: If it ſo be not, then the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the Chroniclers, is, under thoſe unknowne and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſorted names, to give to underſtand the ſucceſſe of their Armada, interpreting them thus, Abſpurge, an Armada, diſperſt; Luxaten, an Armada of weeping: Triffla, an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mada that trembles; Trapena, an Armada which bringeth ſorrow: and Euxaten, an Armada of ſighes: and ſo the conſort is good, for God ſhewing his arme of power and wrath againſt them, he ſcattered them, he gave them weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, tremblings, ſorow and ſighes, ſuch as Spaine never had. You ſaie farther (Sen<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>or poſtmaſter) <hi>that there was found a peece of 25. ſpans in the ſhip of Drake, of a kintall of muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> In the ſhip of Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> there were no other peeces but thoſe, which ſhe had in time before, and this peece that you ſpeake of, ſhould be of your Armada, which peradventure you threwe overboord, to make you more light to flie away, as ſome did. And concerning that you ſaie, <hi>that your Admirall was ſhot with this peece, but that God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved hir:</hi> In good ſooth ſhe preſerved hir ſelfe by flight, not daring abide the musket and caliver ſhot, and indeed they wiſhed for the wings of a bird to flie the faſter, and I thinke all the whole companie fell a blowing in the ſailes to give the ſhip more waie. But now, ſeeing you have prooved ſo ill, leave the office of a Chronicler, and be that of <hi>Marfodius</hi> or <hi>Paſquin,</hi> if you be weary of being a poſt, but if you be not, follow your function, and another time laie not the fault on him that hath it not, neither write that which is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſeeing you ſhal get nothing elſe therby, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hethat ſpits againſt Heaven, which ſpittle fals againe back on his eies.</p>

                  <hi>just</hi> (ſaith David) <hi>are great,</hi> and addeth foorthwith, <hi>but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.</hi> Even ſo thee (O England) hath the Lord delivered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all thy troubles: from ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie an Armada, from ſo much death, from ſo many and ſundrie kinds of torments, as having bin overcome, thou muſt of neceſſitie have taſted: from theſe tribulations hath he delivered thee by his ſtrong hand, giving thee ſuch vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant captaines: If he gave to the people of Iſraell, for they bringing out of Egypt, a <hi>Moyſes,</hi> an <hi>Aaron,</hi> and a <hi>Marie;</hi> To thee he hath given, a moſt Chriſtian and puiſſant Queene, adorned with ſundrie vertues, a <hi>Charles Howard,</hi> a <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> and manie others, whom the Lord had ordained &amp; kept long before, for the defence of his univerſal church &amp; this particular kingdome, which all he yet ſtil preſerveth for greater matters: and what theſe thy woorthies (ô Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land) made not an end of, in performing thy totall delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, the reſt did the wind, the ſea, the rocks, the ſand, the heavens, the fowle, and the fiſh: and now laſtly he delivereth thee, of the untruthes wherein thine enimies boaſted and ſlandered thee; putting time for the unfolding of deceit, fame for the proclaimer, and truth, for the certaine proofe; and ſo their ſlanders and falſe publications remaine al un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twiſted. But returning to my purpoſe, Saint <hi>Anastaſius</hi> ſaith, that even as he who taketh up a viper in his hands to throw to another (to bite him) is firſt bitten of the viper himſelfe; ſo the malicious and murmurer that would perſecute and infame the juſt, doth firſt perſecute himſelfe, and remaines infamed, and deſirous to bite the fame of another, ſlaieth his owne ſoule: for there is no byting of Viper or Aſpe ſo poiſonſome, as the malice of the perverſe; But this cannot ſinke into their underſtanding, which murmur at vertue, &amp; charge hir with vice, and with falſhood, make that which is good ſeeme ill, and of ſtocks make ſtones, like to the fountaine in Almaine whereof <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> maketh
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:9505:17"/>
mention. Of the number of theſe, me ſeemeth, that the Poſtmaſter is, ſeeing, of the peace and affinitie, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Engliſh and the Scots, he wil make wars, ſaieng, that <hi>the Scottiſhmen had taken weapon against the Engliſh:</hi> a moſt inconvenient thing, and utterly unwoorthie to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; for it were the very inſtrument for the Scots to ſtrike off their owne heads withall, to favor their enimies in arms and religion, whereby to make them Lords of their houſes and poſſeſſions. And without all doubt, had the Spaniards taken ſure footing in this land, they would never have ſtaid till they had beene Lords alſo of Scotland; and who can doubt it, for the onely blazon, now adaies amongſt Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, is nothing els but NON SVFFICIT ORBIS, as if they ſhould ſay, <hi>All the world is too little,</hi> and they cannot ſee, that their grave ſufficeth them. But ſuch was the malice of him that wrote this letter, that therwith he meant to ſtir up the minds of Engliſh men, that there might be wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene two kingdoms, borne of one bellie, brethren in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, confederate in perfect peace, and of one language (in a maner:) and the health of the one, depending in not damaging the other. And this the Scottiſhmen knowing well, when the Spaniſh ſhips paſſed by their coaſts, the King commanded to take weapon againſt them, forbidding to permit any Spaniard to land: this is the truth; go not then about to make of ſtocks, ſtones; neither to give us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand things ſo contrarie to reaſon. In this prevention, the King of Scots ſhewed plainly, that he knew the kindled and loftie minds of the Spaniards, who, if they had landed, (imitating the Goads, of whom they deſcend) though it had been under the title of peace, they would ſoone have reacht the crowne, not ſo much to depoſe the King, as to become Lords of the whole world, and to ſhew their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and courage. Now in fine, he that will ſee cleerly, who theſe gloſers are, let him behold what they ſay, and be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to their ſpeeches, and he ſhall ſee their putrified harts laid open. Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, that moſt commonly the looking-glaſſe of the ſoule ſhineth in the words. Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith, that the words which iſſue foorth, are the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:9505:18"/>
ſignes of that which remaineth within: this is alſo aſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Aristotle.</hi> Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, that the mouth is a gate and ſervant of the hart. Socrates ſaith, that ſuch as the man is, ſuch is his talke. <hi>Themistocles</hi> compareth men that be ſilent, unto pictures rold up and incloſed; and thoſe who talke and uſe ſpeech, to pictures ſpred abroad and laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. If thou wilt know what pictures there are in a linnen cloth painted in Flaunders, ſpread it abroad: would you know whereof the hart of a man is painted, be converſant with him. What need we more? Chriſt our Saviour ſaith, that <hi>Of the abundance of the hart the mouth ſpeaketh, and that by our words we ſhall be justified or condemned.</hi> Well knowen and <note place="margin">Matth. 12.</note> manifeſtly do the writers of theſe letters ſhew heere, their want of charitie, and as to the ſonnes of leazings it may be ſaid unto them; <hi>You have the Divell for your father.</hi> This ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth unto me, like that which we reading the ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where the incontinent miſtreſſe of chaſte <hi>Ioſeph</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him of incontinencie: and the proud Hebrewes <note place="margin">Gen. 39.</note> condemned divine <hi>Moſes</hi> of pride: and the unruly <hi>Abſolon</hi>

                  <note place="margin">4. King. 18.</note> of deceit: Even ſo the writers of theſe fabulous let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they being the vanquiſhed, publiſh themſelves victors, and the Engliſhmen by the divine favor being conquerors, they accuſe them for vanquiſhed; and they being thoſe that diſquiet this kingdome, and make war againſt it, lay the fault upon the Scottiſh men, publiſhing them for our eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and that they tooke armes againſt Engliſh men, and they being the ſwift inventors of theſe novelties ſo falſe, they accuſe the Governor of Roan of an inventor and lightnes, and the like they lay upon <hi>George Seguin</hi> of Callis. To all this I ſay, that it is better to be ſlandered by the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, for being vertuous, than by being evill, to be hated of the good. I will put an end to the anſwering of theſe five Letters; for that I have ſufficiently done it (and for that I may have ſome time to anſwer the blinde man, the toong and publiſher of them) onely putting Spaine in mind of a marvellous policie obſerved by the Lacedemonians, who,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:9505:18"/>
the better to conſerve themſelves, eſtabliſhed a lawe, that none ſhould be ſo bold to invent any noveltie in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale. And as this law was upon a time broken, by a famous muſicion (called <hi>Tependarus)</hi> whoſe tranſgreſſion was, that his inſtrument whereon he uſed to play, being of five orders, he added a ſtring, and made it of ſixe: a novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie offending none, neither did it good or harme to the Commonweale, neither altered it the minds of the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, for all this, him they baniſhed the Common-weale, and brake the inſtrument in pieces. With how much more reaſon then (deere Spaine) maiſt thou bereave the lives of theſe inventors of falſe novelties, written ſo much in thy prejudice, and the pen, inkhorne and paper, which ſerved to that uſe, to burne them in the market place. Receive this, ô Spaine, from him that bewailes thy weepings, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, moorning attire, and thy ſcattered ſmall orphans remaining without their fathers aide; and conſider how far better it had been for thee, to have imploied ſuch a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſant Armada againſt infidels, than againſt Chriſtians, baptized in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghoſt, &amp; redeemed by the blood of Chriſt, from whom commeth all our weale, and to whom we yeeld infinite thanks and praiſe for ever and ever,</p>

                     <l>And on the ſixt daie, of month I named last</l>
                     <l>our Armada going on, thorow narrow chanell paſt:</l>
                     <l>And ſo did the contrarie, proceed the ſelfe ſame way:</l>
                     <l>as neere unto England, as either of them may,</l>
                     <l>And the Engliſh thought, the wind of us to get,</l>
                     <l>but God would it not ſo, their purpoſe he did let:</l>
                     <l>And when the darkeſome night, was come upon the skie,</l>
                     <l>the adverſe part prepard, at anker where they lie,</l>
                     <l>Eight ſhips all burning bright, which ſeemed to the view,</l>

                     <l>Of powder full and ſtones, with timber huge and great,</l>
                     <l>with engens many more, which I can not repeat,</l>
                     <l>That they on our Armada, at unawares might drive</l>
                     <l>to burne our ſhips and men, not leaving one alive:</l>
                     <l>But he the king of Heaven, which rules the world wide,</l>
                     <l>permitted not theffect, their treazons put a ſide.</l>
                     <l>For he inſpirde our Duke, of that his foe had wrought,</l>
                     <l>and then the prudent Duke, to prevent the treaſon ſought,</l>
                     <l>Or elſe they burnt must be, wherefore the Duke doth ſend,</l>
                     <l>and wils each man his cable cut, and all away to wend</l>
                     <l>Vnto the ſea, where larger ſcoape they had.</l>
                     <l>his grace did ſo command, which made them alſo glad,</l>
                     <l>Every one did goe, the way that he thought best,</l>
                     <l>and then the flaming ſhips came burning from the rest,</l>
                     <l>They came with loftie pride, with fire which they brought,</l>

but our Armada gone, behind they leaving nought.</l>
                     <l>And their pretended ill, on us tooke no effect,</l>
                     <l>for all their hidden harme, in vaine flew up direct.</l>

I have alſo taken this labor to ſhewe unto Spaine, that il counſellers &amp; flatterers, deſtroy hir: and ſo that it is convenient to avoide them, or better, to puniſh them, that the puniſhing of theſe may be a ſcaring to thoſe

that ſhall come heerafter. I have alſo charged my ſelfe with this burthen, to ſhew in ſhort reaſons, how contrarie things have hapned, to that as was there publiſhed and given to underſtand. It was divulgated in Spaine, that they were vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, they being then vanquiſhed, as well is ſeene. They alſo thought in Spaine not to have left an Engliſh man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live. O blinde imagination, and, ô, ſorrowfull Spaine, howe farre better were it for thee to emploie this ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination (that it might take effect) againſt Infidels, (ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all thy reſt, and calling all Chriſtian kings to thy aide, and it ſhould not be a ſmall ſuccor which thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt have out of this kingdome of England) rather then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſtians, which do nothing daie nor night, but ſerve God and give him thanks. There, there, ô Spaine, ſhouldſt thou ſhew thy power to the enlarging of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and not heere in diminiſhing thereof. Thou perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Engliſh men, as thine enimies, to maintaine the opinion of men, &amp; thou perſecuteſt not the Turke, to maintaine and defend that of God. Thou perſecuteſt Engliſhmen, poore in goods &amp; rich in faith, &amp; thou perſecuteſt not the Turke rich in ſubſtance, and altogither without faith. Thou troubleſt the minds both of us and thy owne common weale, and thou cauſeſt tranquilitie amongſt the Turks, enimies to us all: thou makeſt wars againſt Chriſtianiſme, and giveſt peace unto Paganiſme. Finally that which reſults heerof is, that Chriſtianitie weepeth, and Gentilitie laugheth; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie troubled, and Gentilitie at quiet; Chriſtianitie in wars and the Gentils in peace: Chriſtians in torments, Gentils in contentments: Chriſtians in mourning weeds, Gentils in feaſts; and Chriſtians in burials, and the Gentils in ſports. Behold heer, Spaine, whereto thou haſt made this great and coſtly Armada, to diſcontent thy friends, and pleaſure thy enimies: and the better to pleaſure them, thou wouldeſt not content thee with leſſe than the bereaving of the life of thoſe of this kingdome. And put caſe it had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len out according to thy thoughts, doſt thou not conſider how deere it would haue coſt thee, and that thou ſhouldeſt have remained onely with the lordſhip of earth and ſtones,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:9505:25"/>
mountaines and brambles, and not of men? And if it ſeem unto thee an eaſie matter, to people it a newe: thou haſt not people to do it, unleſſe thou wilt leave thy ſelfe deſert. For if thou looke well into it, thou ſhalt ſee how loſt, thou art alreadie, which loſſe conſiſteth not in ſacks of wool and other merchandiſe, and money, but of thy men: Now for Naples, nowe Cicilia, for Lumbardie, Flanders <hi>(which is thy Sepulchre)</hi> for the Indies, Portingall, and the Terceras, for thy owne coaſts, for Barbarie, for the Ilandes of Mayork and Menorcke, for Sardenia, &amp; the gallies, &amp; finally for the frontiers of thy owne kingdome. And if thou couldeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the people that everie hower goeth out of thee, thou ſhouldeſt ſee how-ſoon thou art like to lie waſte, for though thou haſt much ground, yet is it not all peopled, and that which is inhabited, hath want both of men and women, but ſpecially of men, and ſo if thou ſhouldeſt compaſſe to conquer this kingdome, thou muſt leave thy owne to the Moores; who if the knew the few men that thou haſt, they would not ſleepe ſo long, neither leave thee at ſuch reſt; though peradventure their reſt, is for our unreſt; as one ſhould ſaie, let now Chriſtians breake one anothers heads, let one kill another, and after we will enter to keepe the peace, and ſo remaine lords of all. Who doubteth but that the Turke rejoiceth at the troubles in Fraunce. And no leſſe would he rejoice, that thou, ô, Spaine ſtoodeſt in the like eſtate; yea, that there were no Chriſtianitie in the world. You ſee then heereby, that the deſire which you had, to bereave Engliſhmen of their life, was to conſent with that of the Turks. Againſt this thy wicked deſire, did the mighty arme of God oppoſe it ſelfe, that thou mighteſt not paſſe on therewith, hindring thy ſo ill a thought, and puniſhing thy (ſo great a) follie: puniſhing thee, as thou wouldeſt have puniſhed us. Content thy ſelfe Spaine with that thou haſt, &amp; deſire not to embrace more within thy armes, then thou art well able to compaſſe, for he that ſo doth cannot hold it faſt: and he that murmures at many is hated of many, and he that diſquieteth many, is perſecuted of many. O deere Spaine, and if thou didſt but knowe and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:9505:25"/>
conſider, how dangerous a thing it is, to procure king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and <hi>Signiories,</hi> by unlawfull meanes, and by preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicing thy neighbors and brethren; how ſhouldeſt thou then withdraw thy hands from ſo many wars, excuſe thee of ſo many hard labors, and perſecutions, and loſſe of men and money: how much more, I know thou art not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of that old proverbe which ſaith; <hi>That which is well got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten is loſt: but that which is ill, both it, and the getter.</hi> It is a rule of right, <hi>That of goods ill gotten, the third heire ſhall never enjoie.</hi> Open thy eies, ô, Spaine, and ſee what beſt complieth thee. Example heerof we have in the ſacred Scripture. That <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode Aſcolonita,</hi> which tyrannically and againſt reaſon and <note place="margin">Luc. 3.</note> juſtice, had uſurped the kingdome of Iudea, had his eies ſcant cloſed up, when his kingdom was divided into fower parts, and in the principall parte thereof, which was Iudea, ſucceeded a Gentile for preſident, called <hi>Pilate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The tribes which <hi>Ieroboam</hi> tyrannically uſurped is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">3.

And king <hi>Achab</hi> (which unlawfully poſſeſſed anothers heritage) his houſe was deſtroied by <hi>Iehu.</hi> Neither ſhould it better <note place="margin">4.

But me thinks I heare thee, ô, Spaine to ſaie, that if the heires of theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joied not the goods and poſſeſſions which they got, it was bicauſe they got it againſt reaſon, juſtice, and the will of God. But that thou cameſt with thy mightie Armada, by the ordinance of God and government of the holie Ghoſt, and therefore thou cameſt to deſtroy and kill, and that thou ſhouldſt have enjoied that which thou hadſt got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. If, of ſo vaine a preſumption, thou couldſt alleage anie place of the ſacred Scripture in thy defence; then neither would I call thy preſumption vaine, nor gainſaie thee. But I gainſay thee, bicauſe thou haſt no reaſon, &amp; I cal it vain, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſmokes of thy vainglories, like thoſe of them (of whom <hi>Moyſes</hi> ſpeaketh) that woulde builde a tower, <note place="margin">Gen. 11.</note> whoſe top ſhould reach unto heaven, who, (in rewarde of their pride) were puniſhed and deſtroied. When the Lords
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:9505:26"/>
people went foorth of Egypt, remaining in the wildernes, amongſt other things that the Lord ſpak unto <hi>Moyſes</hi> their guide and captaine generall, this was one (as appeereth:) <note place="margin">Exod. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>That they ſhould not encline to the Gods of the Gentils, but that they ſhould deſtroy and breake their altars.</hi> And afterwards the Lord ſaith unto <hi>Moyſes: Take heede to thy ſelfe that thou make no</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>compact with the inhabitants of the land, whether thou goest, least they be the cauſe of ruine amongst you. But you ſhall overthrowe their altars, and breake their images in peeces, and cut downe their groaves.</hi> God commanded <hi>Ioſhua</hi> to deſtroy the citie of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo, <note place="margin">Ioſhua 6.</note> even to the overthrowing of the wals. All the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Ai</hi> were deſtroied and the citie laid waſte. God <note place="margin">Ioſhua 8.</note> commanded <hi>Gideon</hi> to deſtroy the altar of <hi>Baal,</hi> and he did it. So then theſe, (and others which I might alleage:) If they conquered kingdomes, ſlew the people, and raced ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties unto the grounde, it was by the commandement of God. For ſuch kingdomes, people, and provinces lived, prejudiciall to the honor of God. But who commanded thee, ô, Spaine, to come to make war upon Engliſhmen? If it were by the commandement of God, and for their idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie; give us teſtimonie and ſhew us the place where God ſpake, and ſhew us thy <hi>Moyſes,</hi> thy <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> or thy <hi>Gideon:</hi> and if it were by ill counſellers, puniſh them, and repent thee of that which is done, and amend from hence foorth. I would gladly know which of theſe two cauſes ſtirred up this war, whether the commandement of God, or ill counſell. To the firſt I ſaie (if thou ſaieſt it was by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of God) that thou erreſt in ſo ſaieng, ſith heaven &amp; earth ſhall faile, but the word of God ſhall never faile: and ſo, had his divine Majeſtie commanded thee to come, he had given thee victorie: he gave it thee not; then he was not pleaſed with thy comming. He promiſed the land of promiſe to the children of Iſrael, and though the countrie was ſtrong, and the defenders ſtrong and many, and they weake and weary; yet he gave it them: and to thee would he have given this Iland, had he promiſed it thee. Beſides this, thy comming could not be acceptable to God, neither was it with his conſent: For God now, is not a blouddy God, but a God of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:9505:26"/>
love; he puniſheth not nowe in a ſtrong arme, (as he was woont under that hard lawe) but with a hand of compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and thy comming was, throwing lightnings, thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and thunder bolts, and ſaieng; let them die, let them die, let not a man remaine alive; a matter moſt abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, <hi>ergo,</hi> without his conſent. That God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the captaines of his people, to deſtroy the gods, altars, wals, and groves of their enimies, and to put them to the ſword, the cauſe was (as I ſaide a little before) bicauſe God was offended and diſhonored by them. But we according to the povertie of our ſtrength, bleſſe, &amp; give God thanks, and the honor that is his, we give it not to creatures: Then it is likely he would not command us to be deſtroied by thy wrathfull hand. When his people of Iſraell committed idolatrie, he put them into his enimies hands, and when they acknowledged their ſin, he delivered them: But God delivered not his people of England into the hands of the Spanyards: then God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded them not to com againſt England, neither is this kingdome an enimie to God. The Gentiles had many gods, but Engliſhmen, onely one God, Father, Sonne, and holie Ghoſe, three perſons, and one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie true God, omnipotent, and creator of the univerſall. And in ſuch ſort we beleeve in this God, that we confound not the perſons: for one perſon is of the Father, another of the Sonne; another of the holie Ghoſt; and ſo we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve three perſons, that yet we make not three Gods, but one God, as the ſcripture doth teach us, where he ſaith; <hi>Heare, ô, Iſrael, the Lord our God, is Lord onely.</hi> He nameth God <note place="margin">Deut. 6.</note> three times, bicauſe he conſiſteth of three perſons: and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe three perſons are one God, and not three gods; he ſaith, <hi>is Lord onely:</hi> and for that of this bleſſed Trinitie, the ſecond perſon was incarnate, and clothed himſelfe with our humanitie (for our ſalvation) therefore he ſaith in the ſecond place, <hi>our God.</hi> If then we have one God, whoſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons we confound not, and whoſe ſubſtance we ſeparate not; and ſay that this God, cloathed himſelfe with our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries for our ſalvation, and reconciled us with the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting father, whom (according to our ſmall power) we
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:9505:27"/>
worſhip, and ſerve and obeie him according to his lawes, and not after the lawes of men: Then we have not manie gods, with the Gentiles, neither are we idolators, why God ſhould ſend you to make war upon us: and hence I conclude, that ſeeing God ſent you not, that it is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſe that mooved you: Which is ill counſellers; who mooved by ſome ſecret hatred, deceiving their king, and deſtroie his kingdome: The deſtroiers of kings and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes are ill counſellers. Three hundred yeeres the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes made wars upon thee, yet never werſt thou over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of them, but alwaies victor, till ſuch time as ill coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers deceived thee, ſowing in thee hatred and diviſion. The ill counſels of the falſe prophets, deſtroied <hi>Iezabel, Achab,</hi> and others. And ſo thee, ô, Spaine, have thy il coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers, and falſe prophets, waſhed and deſtroied. One of the chiefeſt cauſes why, thou haſt obtained ſo many victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries againſt Turkes, Moores, the French, and other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, hath bin bicauſe of thy good counſellers: the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the prince and people depends upon good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. And ſo, many honorable perſonages, have exalted manie for their good counſell, and utterly rejected il coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers and flatterers. <hi>Octavius Augustus</hi> gave the dignity of Conſulſhip, to the philoſopher <hi>Frontonius,</hi> with ſundry other dignities, for giving good counſel. <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> cauſed a <hi>Statua</hi> to be erected, which might remaine for a memorie for the celebration of his name, for the excellencie of his learning, and good counſels, as recordeth <hi>Iulius Capitolinus.</hi> The Emperor <hi>Domitian</hi> made <hi>Scillus</hi> oftentimes Conſul for his good counſell, as may be gathered, by certaine verſes of <hi>Martial. Trajan</hi> caried with him in his chariot triumphall <hi>Dion Pruſio,</hi> as affirmeth <hi>Suidas,</hi> for his good counſels, which he obeied. The Emperor <hi>Constantine</hi> made <hi>Ablabius</hi> of his Royall counſell, for his good counſel; ſo ſaith <hi>Eutropius,</hi> and <hi>Volatteran. Petrus Crinit.</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Emperor gave the prefectſhip &amp; charge of war, to the excellent Poet <hi>Aurelius Prudentius,</hi> for the good counſels which he gave him. And <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> king of Perſia, bought good counſell with the waight of money, (for in good counſell conſiſteth
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:9505:27"/>
the peace and conſervation, of the king &amp; kingdome) &amp; ſo did manie other moſt honorable men: the which for not to be tedious, I repeate not, contenting my ſelf with thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed. If then Spain and his king have good counſellers, let them take viewe of the ſucceſſe of their counſels recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Good counſels pacifie and increaſe, and ill counſels trouble and diminiſh. And ſo it appeereth plaine that poor Spaine and his king for having ill counſell, is ſo troubled, and diminiſhed of people and honor. Being nowe poore of people, and rich in enemies: poore of money and rich in expence: emptie of peace and full of warre, and heavilie laden with offendors, and well lighted of defenders. O poore Spain, and what a perfect picture is everie one of thy counſellers, of a king <hi>Herode,</hi> who, to kill Chriſt and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over him, ſlew both his owne and the children of his ſubjects, diminiſhing the fruite of his kingdome: even ſo hath it befallen thee, who to deſtroie the Engliſh and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over them, haſt loſt both thy ſubſtance and ſubjects: And as Chriſt remained free from the bloudie handes of <hi>Herode,</hi> ſo have the Engliſh eſcaped (by the divine favour) from thine. Baniſh <hi>(ſacred king)</hi> thy ill counſellers, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how they are deceivers and flatterers which deſtroie thee and with their fained words deceive thee. <hi>Ioab</hi> came <note place="margin">2. Kings 20.</note> ſmoothly to his friend <hi>Amaſa,</hi> and ſtabbed him thorowe. Thy ill counſellers come ſmoothly to thee (ſacred king) flattering thee with their adulations, and deſtroy thee. <hi>Sawſin</hi> by truſting to the ſweete words of <hi>Dalila,</hi> was put into his enemies hands. Thou haſt truſted (ſacred king) in <note place="margin">Iud. 16.</note> the flatteries of thoſe who are about thee, whereby thou haſt delivered thy treaſures to the cuſtodie of thy enimies: O, lamentable caſe, that ſo milde a king ſhould be in viro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſo many flatterers. Note (king) that our anceſtors were voont to call the toongs of flatterers, a ſworde an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed with honie, which proverbe, S. <hi>Hierome</hi> vſeth in an Epiſtle. God commanded the children of Iſraell, that they ſhould not touch the tabernacles of the ungodly, nor anie thing of theirs, that they might not be defiled. And alſo, that at their entring the land of Canaan, that they ſhould <note place="margin">Num. 33.</note>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:9505:28"/>
deſtroy and baniſh all the inhabitants of that province, to the end that they might not be infected with their ill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and cuſtomes. For even as the hands (though never ſo white) by handling of coales, become blacke and pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; even ſo, be a man never ſo good, if he be converſant with ill counſellers, ſhall alſo become ill. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, that he that toucheth pitch, ſhall be defiled therewith. Depart then, ô, king, and moſt woorthy prince, from ſuch ill coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers which waſte and conſume thee, and trouble and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroie thy kingdome. They fell themſelves unto thee for true friends, being deceitfull enimies. Take heede (mightie king) for if theſe flatterers follow thee; it is not for thy roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all perſons ſake, nor for thy vertues, but onely for thy great riches. For in like ſort as the woode breedeth the woorme which eateth &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumeth it; even ſo rich men bring up flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers which by litle &amp; litle deſtroie them. This underſtood <note place="margin">Pſal. 141.</note> wel the Pſalmiſt when he ſaid. <hi>Let the righteous rather ſmite me friendly, &amp; reproove me. But let not their precious balms break mine head.</hi> There he calleth the flatterie of the wicked, <hi>precious balmes: My people,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iſaiah) they that call thee bleſſed, even they deceave thee.</hi> More hurt (ſaith S. <hi>Hierome)</hi> doth the toong of the flatterer, then the ſword of the enimie. By ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting (moſt woorthie king) the balme of thy ill coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers, thou haſt deceived thy ſelfe: They call thee moſt mightie, and the onely deſerver of all the kingdomes of the world. They warrant thee, that thou maiſt raiſe a thouſand tributes in thy countrie, wherewith to conquere others kingdomes: and they have done thee more harme then the ſwords of thine enimies. Flatterers are ſo prejudiciall, that <hi>Antiſtenes</hi> ſaith, it is better to fal into the power of Ravens, then of flatterers, for the Ravens eate the eies of the dead, but the flatterers corrupt the minds of the living: ſo record <hi>Laertius</hi> and <hi>Bruſonius,</hi> though others attribute this ſaieng to <hi>Diogenes.</hi> And the ſame <hi>Laertius</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Bias,</hi> the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher being asked, what beaſt was moſt poiſonſome, he anſwered, of wilde beaſts the tyrant, and of tame beaſts the flatterer. <hi>AEneus Silvius</hi> reporteth, that the Emperor <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund,</hi> was ſuch an enimie to flatterers, that on a time not
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:9505:28"/>
being able to ſuffer the flatterings of one that praiſed him overmuch, he gave him a blowe, who ſaieng, why doſt thou ſtrike me Emperor? He anſwered; flatterer, why doeſt thou bite me? And with this (moſt valorous king) I conclude and make an ende of this particular matter: That men of high ſpirits, give not their eares to flatterers, neither accept ill counſellers. Behold it heer prooved, that the arming of Spaine, was not by the commandement of God, but through ill counſell, and therefore it periſhed. Beſides this, the Spanyards gave out (the more to pricke their people forward in fury) that if the Engliſh ſhould take any of them, that they would kill him, and not leave anie alive that ſhould fall into their hands. Truely, though the Engliſh had bin of that mind, yet had they offred no injurie to the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards: for if they came proclaiming death; had it bin much that Engliſh men ſhould proclaime death? The <hi>Eccho</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth ſtill unto the voice without changing the words. If you ſaie evill; it anſwers evill; if good, good; if pain, paine; if glorie, glorie; the Spanyards come then, ſaieng, fire, the <hi>Eccho</hi> anſwers in Engliſhmen, fire; Spanyards ſay bloud, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhmen ſaie bloud; Spanyards ſaie death, Engliſhmen ſaie death; Spanyards ſaie war, Engliſhmen ſaie war; and when they ſhall ſaie peace, then Engliſhmen will anſwer peace: But now if Engliſhmen ſhould kill all their priſoners, they ſhould do them no injurie, nor breake <hi>jus Gentium,</hi> neither that which is <hi>de jure belli,</hi> for this war deſerves not the name of a good war, bicauſe it was mooved by covetouſnes and tyrannie, and not for valour and increaſe of honor. There were wars betweene the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the fift &amp; <hi>Francis</hi> king of Fraunce; but the originall was neither of tyrannie, nor covetouſnes: and this was ſeene apparantly; for <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> being priſoner by the Emperor, neer unto <hi>Pavia,</hi> in the yeere 1525. and from thence carried into Spaine: the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror never willed him to reſigne his crowne, neither was his thought ſuch, or ever went he about it; but rather ſet both him and his free, for in fine, they were rather wars of braverie then tyrannie. But in this war of Spaine againſt England, Spaine comming with armed hand, to deprive hir
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:9505:29"/>
Majeſtie of Sceprer and crowne, what injuſtice ſhould ſhe do, in cauſing all to be ſlaine, that ſhall come to hand? for tyrants deſerve no leſſe then death: And ſith Spanyards in this war ſhew themſelves tyrants, (<note n="*" place="margin">My author is a Spanyard and therfore whatſoever you thinke or know to the contrary, yet you muſt beare with his parenthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis in this point.</note> though naturally they be not ſo) they ſhould have no wrong done them, had they all bin ſlaine. But in fine, ſuch as the fountaine is, ſuch are the ſtreames, if the fountaine be ſweete, the ſtreames are ſweete, and if the fountaine be brackiſh, the rivers are brac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh. The fountaine of England, which is the ſacred Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (whom the Lord long preſerve) is a ſweete fountaine, full of love, compaſſion, clemencie, and benignitie, and ſo are hir ſubjects; for ſuch as the Lord is, ſuch is the vaſſall. This is verefied in the ſacred Scripture. <hi>Herademas troubled and all Ieruſalem with him.</hi> And <hi>Achab</hi> and <note place="margin">Mat. 2. 4. King.</note> 
                  <hi>Ieſabell</hi> being wicked, ſo were the people: ſo that a good king hath good ſubjects; and ſo as hir Majeſtie is merciful, ſo are hir ſubjects; and hence it groweth, that the Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men not reſpecting the tyrannie of this war, nor the bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die hands of the ſoldiers; but uſing clemencie with the priſoners, they have not taken their lives, but rather as though the wars had bin ſuch, as was betweene <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Francis,</hi> ſo have they bin well intreated and ſuccoured with meate, with apparell, hoſe and ſhooes, ſhirts, firing and other neceſſaries, Engliſhmen ſeeming to be ſorie, and to bewaile the poore Spanyards, which periſhed in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, by the hands of the ſavage Iriſhmen; and to ſerve for meate, ſome in the ſea for the fiſh, and others on the land, for the carrion Crowes; ſo that they ſorrowe the loſſe of the dead, and ſuccour the neceſſitie of the priſoners. And all this, for being hir Majeſtie full of love and not of rigor, and ſo aboundant in clemencie, and not in revenge, a greater friend to pardon, then to puniſh: and uſing more of mercie then juſtice, ſhe ſhewes hir ſelfe moſt Chriſtian, and fearing God: Vnto whom, his divine Majeſtie graunt, long yeeres of life, augment and proſper hir eſtate, as is needfull for the holie church ſake, (ſhe being a true defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereof) and as hir humble and loiall ſubjects deſire, Amen.</p>
