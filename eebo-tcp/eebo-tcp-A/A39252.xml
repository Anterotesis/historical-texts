            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

  neither <hi>sow,</hi> nor <hi>reap,</hi> nor carry into Barn; they neither
  <hi>labour,</hi> nor <hi>Spin,</hi> nor do any thing else for the good of
  humane society: Let them know, there is not <hi>the poorest Contemptible</hi>
  Creature, that crieth <hi>Oysters</hi> and <hi>Kitchinstuffe</hi> in the
  streets, but deserveth his bread better, than they; and his course of life is
  of better esteem with God, and every sober wise man, than their's. A

               <p>Consider this, you that are of <hi>Noble</hi> and

  <hi>Gentry</hi> and <hi>Nobility.</hi> Scarce shall you find a man of them,
  that gave any accession, or brought any noted eminency to his house; but either
  serving in <hi>the Camp,</hi> or sweating at <hi>the Barre,</hi> or waiting at
  <hi>the Court,</hi> or adventuring on <hi>the Seas,</hi> or trucking in his

 great a <hi>Boldnesse</hi> in these following lines.</p>
            <p>With <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I very much love to be talking of
 <hi>Gentlemen;</hi> with him that is a <hi>Gentleman indeed,</hi> that in
 <hi>his</hi> language (for in <hi>better,</hi> I am sure, I cannot) I may
 learne how to shame his <hi>Counterfiet;</hi> and with <hi>him</hi> too, who
 has no more then the <pb n="2" facs="tcp:42817:10"/> bare <hi>Name,</hi> that I may thereby
 gaine an opportunity of proposing to him some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better then
 <hi>himselfe,</hi> as a fit object of his <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Imitation.</hi>
 I confesse I am often apt, more then well becomes me in the presence of

 <hi>Satyrically</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such as this <hi>wanton Age</hi> of the World

 more <hi>Bold</hi> then <hi>Wise.</hi> What your <hi>resentments</hi> were of

 both as to what he <hi>is,</hi> and what he <hi>should be.</hi> I must not taxe
 you of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretion,</hi> by telling you how <hi>ill</hi> you have placed
 your <hi>Commands;</hi> and therefore I shall rather choose to show you your

 <pb n="3" facs="tcp:42817:10"/> by an <hi>unseasonable Modesty, seem</hi> to questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your
 <hi>judgment:</hi> The <hi>taske</hi> injoyn'd me is in it selfe so
 <hi>odious,</hi> that nothing <hi>lesse</hi> then that <hi>highest</hi> respect
 I have for the worthy <hi>Imposer,</hi> could make it <hi>welcome;</hi> and it
 carries so great a <hi>disproportion</hi> to my <hi>weaker</hi> Faculties, that
 nothing, but <hi>too</hi> great an <hi>affection</hi> in you (Sir) could make
 it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare <hi>possible.</hi> To tell you, what the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman is,</hi>
 requires an <hi>experience;</hi> and to say what he <hi>should be,</hi> must
 suppose a <hi>Breeding</hi> farre above mine.</p>
            <p>If by the <hi>Gentleman,</hi> you meane <hi>him</hi> whose <hi>reall
 virtues</hi> are such as have indeed <hi>merited</hi> him the name; I could goe
 a very compendious way to worke, and show you him in as faire a peece as
 <hi>Virtue</hi> can <hi>draw,</hi> or the <hi>World imitate,</hi> by directing
 your eye to <hi>that</hi> object which <hi>best</hi> deserves it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You must

 meane. But for the <hi>other,</hi> whom wee then tooke the <hi>boldnesse</hi>
 to talke of, you cannot, I hope, imagine, that one so little acquainted with
 the present <hi>Garbes</hi> and <hi>Modes</hi> of the world, as without
 <hi>blushing</hi> I dare confesse my selfe to be, should be able to present you
 <pb n="4" facs="tcp:42817:11"/> with his perfect <hi>portraiture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To be short, Sir, <hi>You</hi> are too <hi>well</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
 with the <hi>true Gentleman,</hi> to think you shall ever read him any where
 better described then you find him <hi>at home;</hi> and I am too
 <hi>little</hi> acquainted with his <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit,</hi> to presume I may be
 able to give you an exact <hi>Character</hi> of him, 'till I use to goe more,
 then I hope in hast I shall doe, <hi>abroad.</hi> However, I had rather betray
 my. <hi>Ignorance</hi> of what I could never yet esteem well <hi>worth</hi> my
 <hi>knowledg;</hi> then the least <hi>disrespect</hi> to a <hi>Person,</hi>
 whose long-experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced <hi>Goodnesse</hi> hath abundantly meritted the best of

 him, whilest <hi>immured</hi> up within the <hi>narrow</hi> compasse of a

 <hi>Man</hi> and his <hi>shadow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I begin to discribe him, I find it necessary for me to
 premise unto you this <hi>cautious request</hi>—That you would be pleas'd
 to believe I doe not <hi>make</hi> nor take <hi>pleasure</hi> to <hi>see</hi>
 those <hi>wounds,</hi> which <hi>you</hi> have perswaded me to
 <hi>uncover;</hi> for <pb n="5" facs="tcp:42817:11"/> I cannot but foresee too many of
 them, through <hi>Imprudence</hi> and <hi>Negligence,</hi> so altogether
 <hi>fester'd</hi> and <hi>Nauseous,</hi> that as they will <hi>try</hi> your
 <hi>patience</hi> to <hi>behold</hi> them, so will they even <hi>dare</hi> your
 <hi>faith</hi> to <hi>believe</hi> them: And this I shall further beg of you,
 that seeing to serve you I am <hi>forced</hi> to take the <hi>Liberty</hi> of a
 more <hi>open,</hi> and sometimes <hi>biting</hi> expression; you would not
 debarre me of the <hi>Priviledg</hi> of an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall,</hi> yet

 and is excusable, though sometimes he seeme so hard-hearted as to

            </p>
            <p>I must in Good Earnest tell the <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> how much my
 <hi>Pitty</hi> and <hi>Commisera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> outgoe my <hi>Reprehensions</hi> and

 and ever <hi>shall be</hi> much more <hi>for</hi> him, then my <hi>unpleasing

 ascend as high as Heaven to Implore God's <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> and <hi>Pitty</hi>
 towards him. For I know it (let him entertaine as <hi>flattering</hi> thoughts
 as he will of himselfe) the <hi>world</hi> has not had since the fall of

<hi>Gentleman</hi> must be thought only such a man, as may without

One that esteems it <hi>base</hi> and <hi>ungentile,</hi> to <hi>Feare</hi> a
God, to <hi>own</hi> a Law, or <hi>Practice</hi> a Religion; One who has
studied to bring <hi>Sin</hi> so much into <hi>Fashion,</hi> and with so much

suite with the <hi>Gentleman's</hi> Actions. But the <hi>proudest</hi> vice is
ashamed to weare it's <hi>own</hi> face long; Nor dare I believe the
<hi>Devill</hi> to be much in love with his <hi>own</hi> Name; I am sure
<hi>neither</hi> is willing to be thought such as in truth they are; but
<hi>wickednesse</hi> has worne <hi>vertue's mask</hi> quite thread-bare; and
<hi>Sathan</hi> hath so often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared like an <hi>Angell</hi> of
<hi>Light,</hi> that 'tis now evident, he is not enamour'd of his <hi>own

then <hi>weare</hi> the Devill's <hi>Livery;</hi> though he be willing enough
to be the <hi>man,</hi> yet he abhorres the <hi>Name.</hi> Thus he thinks

<hi>Reputation,</hi> no more, but the <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> of <hi>Popular
breath;</hi> and that his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Happinesse</hi> (as his Temporall
<hi>estate)</hi> is entailed upon the <hi>bare Name</hi> alone; and by a little
alteration of <hi>that,</hi> he may (when he pleases) translate his
<hi>Title</hi> from <hi>Hell</hi> to <hi>Heaven:</hi> So fondly Sollicitous he
is (that I may use his own Language) to <hi>Trapan</hi> his own <hi>Soule,</hi>
and by the Lamentable <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture</hi> of a <hi>Borrow'd</hi> Name
<hi>cheat</hi> her out of a most Glorious Inheritance.</p>
               <p>Hence he endeavours a little more to <pb n="13" facs="tcp:42817:15"/>
                  <hi>Civilize</hi> the Title, and calls himselfe in a more <hi>pleasing</hi>

to bring even <hi>Heaven</hi> it selfe <hi>in love</hi> with him; and make it
as the <hi>trees</hi> did <hi>Orpheus,</hi> to <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> him
whithersoever he goeth; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly so it must, and with some speed too, or
he shall never see it, seeing he is alway <hi>running,</hi> as fast as he can,
the quite <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> way. But, alas, this is all he is like to
<hi>gain</hi> by the pittifull <hi>exchange;</hi> that whereas the ungratefull
<hi>sound</hi> of the <hi>former</hi> names, did so <hi>startle</hi> the

of all the <hi>vices</hi> in the World must be summon'd in to make up a

dare hardly think him Capable, lest thereby granting him a <hi>Compleat
Essence,</hi> I should be forced, at lest in a <hi>Metaphysicall</hi> Notion,
to call him <hi>Good. Good-man</hi> is a title he hath ever much scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and
it is that which (If yet his <hi>pride</hi> will afford him <hi>any)</hi> he

<hi>Constitution,</hi> that ere we shall be able to fit him with a
<hi>name,</hi> wee must borrow it from <hi>Sathan</hi> himselfe and call him
<hi>Legion.</hi> As <hi>sinne</hi> and <hi>vanity</hi> make up his very

<hi>Iudgment:</hi> A retreat into <hi>Sobriety</hi> would betray such an
<hi>Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacy</hi> of spirit, as might argue him in love with a
<hi>Religion;</hi> and make the world <pb n="19" facs="tcp:42817:18"/> believe he were such
a <hi>Coward</hi> as might be <hi>Frighted</hi> into <hi>Piety.</hi> Every
<hi>petty</hi> sinner can <hi>outface</hi> an <hi>Earthly,</hi> hee'l doe his
best to <hi>out-vapour</hi> an <hi>Heavenly</hi> Tribunall; and make it appeare
unto all, that a <hi>Gentleman</hi> has a <hi>Spirit,</hi> dares <hi>goe</hi>
to Hell, before he will be said to <hi>feare</hi> it. Indeed <hi>he</hi> alone
seems to have the art of turning <hi>Nature</hi> upside-down, and will onely be
a perfect <hi>man</hi> at the <hi>Pap,</hi> when he is <hi>wean'd</hi> he gives
both his <hi>humanity</hi> and <hi>Innocence</hi> to his <hi>Nurse</hi> for her
<hi>wages,</hi> I am sure he is <hi>rarely,</hi> if <hi>ever,</hi> after that
time, seen to have <hi>either</hi> about him. In short, The <hi>Gentleman</hi>
is nothing that he <hi>should</hi> be: His whole <hi>life</hi> is a flat
<hi>Contradiction</hi> to his <hi>duety;</hi> His constant <hi>study</hi> is to
teach his <hi>Body</hi> how to put <hi>affronts</hi> upon his <hi>soul,</hi>
and to give <hi>him</hi> the <hi>lie</hi> who dares tell him there are any
<hi>hopes</hi> it may be <hi>saved;</hi> He laughs at him that tells him there
is any other <hi>Heaven</hi> then that of his own <hi>creating,</hi> any other
<hi>happinesse</hi> besides his <hi>pleasures,</hi> or an <hi>Hell</hi> diverse
from that which <hi>Christianity</hi> has objected to the <hi>Coward's
Phancy.</hi> He has the <hi>Courage</hi> to be <hi>any</hi> thing but <hi>what
he should</hi> be, an <hi>Honest man</hi> or a <hi>Good Christian.</hi>

rack his <hi>brains,</hi> and rob his <hi>soule</hi> as much of her
<hi>Naturall</hi> as her <hi>Spirituall</hi> rest, to supply the
<hi>wanton</hi> world with <hi>variety</hi> of Inventions. He takes an
especiall care that nothing may ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare <hi>old</hi> about him, but the
<hi>Old Man of Sin,</hi> and him he every day exposes to Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick view in a
<hi>severall Dresse,</hi> that (if it be possible) he may perswade the world to
believe that all <hi>there</hi> is <hi>New</hi> too. Indeed so
<hi>miserably</hi> happy is he in <hi>Inventions</hi> of this sinfull Nature,
that any man, who had not a <hi>Spirituall</hi> eye, to discerne the same
<hi>Proud</hi> and <hi>Luxurious Divell</hi> in all his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, would almost
think he had a <hi>new Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> as well as a <hi>New Suit</hi> for every

               <p>He is all but a <hi>Proud</hi> and <hi>Glistering Masse</hi> of

<hi>Idle</hi> but <hi>Dead</hi> that does just <hi>Nothing.</hi> It is his task
ever to be doing, <hi>Nothing</hi> to a <hi>Good</hi> but <hi>much</hi> to a

not to <hi>move</hi> so much as a little finger, yet even <hi>then</hi> is his

               <p>So soone as his <hi>age</hi> is capable of <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
and <hi>Discipline</hi> he is sent to <hi>School,</hi> or rather by reason of
too great an Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in his fond Parents, the <hi>School</hi> is brought

<hi>himselfe:</hi> But it shall not be long, ere he find roome enough
<hi>abroad</hi> in the world, wherein he may <hi>lose</hi> himselfe again. Yet 
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42817:21"/> truely it is a great rarity in this age, to see the

and vapours of <hi>lust.</hi> It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too usuall a thing with the

early his <hi>Father's own Sonne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Most <hi>Gentlemen</hi> seem to make it a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall piece of their
<hi>fatherly</hi> care to stave off their <hi>Children</hi> as long as they can

<hi>Spurious.</hi> To infuse so early into the <hi>Young Child</hi> the
<hi>graver</hi> Notions of God and Goodnesse, were to make him <hi>Old</hi>
before his time, and these would look no better then so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>wrinkles</hi>
and <hi>furrowes</hi> in the <hi>fresh</hi> cheeks of an <hi>infant:</hi> alas,
what were this but an <hi>unspiriting</hi> of the <hi>Child</hi> and laying an

<hi>youth?</hi> 'Tis fit he should be <hi>mann'd</hi> up by <hi>bold</hi> and

<hi>emasculate</hi> the brave soule of a <hi>Young Gentleman,</hi> and make it

                  <hi>Generous</hi> actions. To instruct him how

<hi>first</hi> be taught to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Goodnesse.</hi>
It is indeed most lamentable to consider how very few of those we call
<hi>Gentlemen</hi> endeavour to make their <hi>Children</hi> either <hi>Honest
men</hi> or <hi>Good Christians:</hi> as if it were their onely
<hi>busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> to <hi>beget</hi> them, and when they are come into the
world, to <hi>teach</hi> them by their own <hi>example,</hi> how they may most
<hi>unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably</hi> spend the short <hi>leavings</hi> of their own
<hi>Luxury.</hi> Thus at their <hi>death</hi> leave they them <hi>doubly</hi>
Miserable in bequeathing them, <hi>first,</hi> little to live upon, and
<hi>secondly,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waies to spend it. Indeed the greatest
<hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>providence</hi> in such <hi>Prodigall Parents,</hi>
were either <hi>not</hi> to beget Children <hi>at all,</hi> or to beget them
<hi>meer beggars,</hi> that so they might not <hi>give</hi> them, with their

as <hi>poore Boyes</hi> doe in some <hi>Princes</hi> Courts, to
<hi>sustain</hi> the blame of the <hi>Young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's</hi> Miscarriages, and
whom the <hi>father</hi> may <hi>chide</hi> and <hi>beat</hi> when the

(call it which you will) of <hi>making</hi> the <hi>Schollar,</hi> or
<hi>spoiling</hi> the <hi>Gentleman;</hi> seeing his <hi>parents</hi> had taken

he is permitted to continue a <hi>yeare</hi> or <hi>two,</hi> if he have no
<hi>mother</hi> upon whom he must bestow at least <hi>three</hi> parts of that
time in <hi>visits,</hi> else his <hi>Father</hi> knows not well where he may
with more <hi>Credit</hi> loose so much good <hi>time,</hi> or is it may be

                  <hi>learn'd</hi> how to make choise of his <hi>boon Companions,</hi> how to

as he did the <hi>Liberall Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences</hi> in the
<hi>Colledg.</hi> Here his <hi>pretence</hi> is to <hi>study</hi> and
<hi>follow</hi> the Law, but it's his <hi>Resolution</hi> never to

it, it is to this one <hi>end,</hi> that he may know how to <hi>plead</hi> for

<hi>Law</hi> then <hi>Honesty,</hi> as to <hi>Cozen</hi> him that has more

then before, having now the <hi>Mock-happinesse</hi> of a <hi>Licentious</hi>
life, and a <hi>Manumission</hi> from the <hi>Tyranny</hi> (as he termes it) of
a <hi>School-master</hi> and <hi>Tutor.</hi> This he reckons the happy

whereof his whole life-time is to be one continued <hi>day</hi> of

               <p>As his <hi>Condition of life</hi> seems now to be <hi>New,</hi> so

<hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Wantonnesse</hi> have a very <hi>rare</hi> and

                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:42817:24"/> he might be thought <hi>happy.</hi>
When you look upon his <hi>Apparell,</hi> you will be apt to say, he wears his

there you see as much of it, as he ever shall. He is so trick'd up in

fear'd were the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of that <hi>Forme</hi> which <hi>God</hi> and

               <p>His <hi>Language and Discourse</hi> are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suitable to
his <hi>Habit</hi> and <hi>Garbe;</hi> All <hi>affected</hi> and

make it his whole businesse whensoever he <hi>dares</hi> be <hi>Bookish</hi>
(which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he dreads as much as any thing but to be Good) to furnish
himselfe with an <hi>Elegant</hi> and <hi>Courtlike expression;</hi> yet will
all but amount to this at most, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he may be <hi>able</hi> to
talke <hi>well,</hi> and show us how much he is a better <hi>Speaker</hi> then
a <hi>man:</hi> That he shall be able to <hi>carve</hi> out his

and <hi>Dissembling Complements,</hi> and to <hi>Interlard</hi> an affected
discourse, with many an <hi>Impertinent Parenthesis.</hi> And then amidst all
this his <hi>Time-observing</hi> hand and foot do so <hi>point, accent</hi> and
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne</hi> all with Curious and Phantastick <hi>flourishes,</hi> that his

               <p>A piece of <hi>noisy Bombast</hi> denominates him one of the great

is dress'd up in so <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>Antique</hi> a forme; that

Such are the <hi>Spungy Eares</hi> 
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:42817:27"/> of most Companions,
that they will <hi>suck</hi> in nothing but <hi>froth:</hi> And the

which were sent into the world to <hi>guide</hi> him timely and truly out of it

               </p>
               <p>Neither are his <hi>Discourses</hi> less <hi>Beastly</hi> then
<hi>Devillish,</hi> less <hi>Filthy</hi> then <hi>Malicious.</hi> So foul,
<hi>obseane,</hi> and nauseous for the most part are his <hi>words,</hi> that
some one or other as little <hi>acquainted</hi> with a God as <hi>himsefe,</hi>
will be apt to conclude, that <hi>nature spoyl'd</hi> him in the making, and
set his <hi>Mouth</hi> at the <hi>wrong end</hi> of his <hi>Body.</hi>
Certainly there must be a <hi>Corrupted</hi> and <hi>putrified Soul</hi>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42817:28"/> turne our <hi>Booksellers shops</hi> into so many
<hi>Iakes:</hi> But he takes a great deal of pleasure to <hi>lick</hi> with his
<hi>tongue,</hi> the Nauseous <hi>Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> and Putrified <hi>sores,</hi>
and the Infectious <hi>Leprosies</hi> of <hi>wit.</hi> O how does he delight to

<hi>Lip-Adultery.</hi> As there is not any more filthy vice of the tongue then
this; so neither do I ever find the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man more in Love with any other;
Except it be that one which I am now to name.</p>
               <p>And that is it, which indeed I <hi>tremble</hi> to
<hi>mention,</hi> though he esteems it the greatest <hi>Grace</hi> and
<hi>Ornament</hi> of his Discourse. I mean, <hi>Swearing.</hi> For as the
<hi>Gentleman</hi> seems Continually to <hi>measure</hi> out his <hi>time</hi>
by <hi>sins</hi> insteed of <hi>Minutes;</hi> so his <hi>louder Oaths,</hi>
were they not so very frequent, might well be Compared to the <hi>Great
Clocke,</hi> which gives us notice how his <hi>houres</hi> passe. This is that
pleasing part of his language, wherein he so ordinarily bids <hi>defiance</hi>
to his <hi>God,</hi> and so powerfully <hi>Courts</hi> the <hi>Devill;</hi>
with whom <pb n="38" facs="tcp:42817:29"/> by this means he has as <hi>frequent
Converse</hi> as if he were his <hi>Familiar.</hi> And he has so great a

that <hi>Language Sathan</hi> himselfe, may in a little time stand in need of
an <hi>Interpreter</hi> to understand him.</p>
               <p>This is a <hi>sin</hi> to which there are so few co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable

proves how <hi>straight</hi> he can goe to <hi>Hell</hi> and how <hi>fast,</hi>
without a <hi>guide</hi> or <hi>baite.</hi> Here indeed he seems to cry out
up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Eve</hi> for a <hi>Lazy</hi> and <hi>dull</hi> sinner, whilst in
Every <hi>Oath</hi> he loudly <hi>swears,</hi> that <hi>soul</hi> not to be
worth a damning, which cannot <hi>sin</hi> without a <hi>temptation.</hi> Tis
here he expresses his great <hi>Charity</hi> to the <hi>Devill,</hi> for as if
he were afraid the <hi>tempter</hi> should have to great a <hi>load</hi> of
<hi>other</hi> men's <hi>sins</hi> at the <hi>last</hi> and <hi>great</hi> day
of acounts, he freely <hi>exempts</hi> him from putting his <hi>helping
hand</hi> to <hi>some</hi> of his sins, and openly professes he is able to goe
farre enough <hi>out</hi> of the way to <hi>Heaven</hi> without a
<hi>seducer.</hi>

               <p>How many <hi>Horrible</hi> and <hi>hideous Oathes</hi> 
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:42817:29"/> does he daily <hi>invent,</hi> onely to <hi>swell</hi> up
his <hi>cheekes,</hi> and make his <hi>words</hi> sound <hi>high</hi> and
<hi>bigge</hi> in the Eares of those that <hi>tremble</hi> not to
<hi>heare</hi> him? with what <hi>boldnesse</hi> and <hi>pride</hi> does he
abuse God's most <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous Name,</hi> by making it a
<hi>cloake</hi> and <hi>varnish</hi> to set off his most <hi>false, loose,</hi>
and <hi>prophane</hi> speeches. As if indeed he had this desperate
<hi>designe</hi> upon Almighty God, to render his sacred <hi>Name Odious</hi>
to the world, by taking it so often into his <hi>prophane lips.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unto <hi>this</hi> we may here adde that <hi>other</hi> as Common
extravagancy of his <hi>tongue,</hi> which is the <hi>abusing</hi> and making a
<hi>Mock</hi> of God's <hi>Word,</hi> as well as his <hi>Name.</hi> His
<hi>Rhetoricke</hi> seemes all <hi>Low</hi> and <hi>Flat</hi> so long as his
<hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors</hi> lye on <hi>this</hi> side <hi>Prophanenesse;</hi> but when

<hi>set his face against the Heavens,</hi> and to <hi>embosse</hi> his

               <p>I am afraid it is now too late to tell you what is the

<hi>ashamed</hi> of nothing so much as that any man should have the
<hi>charity</hi> to <hi>think</hi> him so, Against this <hi>Ignominious
brand</hi> of a <hi>Godly man,</hi> he takes the readiest Course he can to

Nothing but <hi>Necessity</hi> can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade him to do <hi>either.

And yet he is so Confident to <hi>Enjoy</hi> them <hi>all</hi> at last, as if
he thought God would be <hi>beholding</hi> to him for <hi>accepting</hi> his
blessings, or as some foolish <hi>lovers</hi> take occasion to <hi>double</hi>
their <hi>addresses</hi> from the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindness</hi> of a <hi>Coy

               </p>
               <p>If ever the <hi>Gentleman</hi> appeares at <hi>Church,</hi> it is
but to give you a testimony of his <hi>cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,</hi> whereby he shows how he
<hi>dare</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>venture</hi> upon what he most <hi>feares.</hi>
But then he behaves himselfe so <hi>proudly</hi> there, as if he would
<hi>Command</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> God of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi>
to <hi>keep his distance,</hi> and he may be sure, <hi>so</hi> he will, for he
will <hi>draw nigh</hi> unto <hi>none</hi> but such as will first <hi>draw
nigh</hi> unto <hi>him.</hi> But some times his appearance in the <hi>Holy
Assembly</hi> argues more <hi>Cowardice</hi> then <hi>Courage,</hi> and shews
that he <hi>fears</hi> the <hi>Constable</hi> more then <hi>God;</hi> and to be
<hi>religious</hi> more then to appear so. Here if he stay long, he is no lesse

then if both his <hi>Eares</hi> were fast <hi>nailed</hi> to the

<hi>soft-hearted,</hi> as to profess a <hi>Religion,</hi> so well has their

               <p>If the <hi>Gallant</hi> have no <hi>estate</hi> (as many who think

<hi>Ingenious frolick.</hi> Here he lyes <hi>drinking</hi> out the
<hi>Day,</hi> except he be forced to <hi>sleep</hi> out <pb n="43" facs="tcp:42817:31"/>
the last <hi>night's</hi> Intemperance. This is the stage of his <hi>Wit</hi>
and <hi>wantonnesse:</hi> where he thinkes himselfe a <hi>Champion,</hi> when
he can kick <hi>two</hi> down staires at <hi>once,</hi> the <hi>Drawer</hi>
&amp; his <hi>Bottle,</hi> and sound the <hi>Alarme</hi> to the
<hi>Skirmish</hi> in a Loud <hi>peal</hi> of New-fashion'd <hi>Curses.</hi>
Afterall's done there, he walkes the <hi>streets</hi> as <hi>light</hi> in his
<hi>head</hi> as his <hi>Purse,</hi> and much oftner sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutes the

               </p>
               <p>He Drinks as <hi>stoutly,</hi> as if he meant to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>liquor</hi> enough with him in his Belly to quench the <hi>flames</hi> of
Hell; or rather as if he meant to <hi>drink</hi> himselfe so farre into a
<hi>Beast,</hi> as he might thereby become <hi>uncapable</hi> of
<hi>Damnation.</hi> When he has <hi>Drunk</hi> his fill, he studies how to make
the next young <hi>heir</hi> he meets with, <hi>pay</hi> the reckoning. If he
chance to meet with some poore Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent <hi>Lady,</hi> whom a <hi>sweet
word</hi> or <hi>two</hi> may make his miserable <hi>prey,</hi> he makes a

this will both pay the <hi>shot,</hi> and his <hi>Common she</hi> for his next

               </p>
               <p>In a word, this <hi>Ranting Gentleman</hi> is a <hi>Golden</hi> or
at least a <hi>Gilded sinner,</hi> a <hi>Royall stave,</hi> a <hi>Prodigall

something more of <hi>Modesty</hi> and the <hi>man,</hi> 
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:42817:34"/>
then in the <hi>former,</hi> yet shall we not find <hi>much more</hi> then what

and his <hi>Gold</hi> like <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his <hi>Twinnes, live</hi> and
<hi>thrive,</hi> and are <hi>sick</hi> and <hi>dye</hi> together: and yet it
were much to be wish'd he were but <hi>halfe</hi> so industrious to preserve
the <hi>one,</hi> as he is to keep the <hi>other.</hi> Insteed of <hi>laying up
his treasure in Heaven,</hi> he lays up his <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> in his
<hi>Treasury;</hi> and, if God will be content with it soe, he shall be sure to
have his <hi>heart there too. Covetousness,</hi> I dare say, in <hi>such</hi>
as <hi>hee,</hi> is the greatest <hi>Idolatry;</hi> I am confident he would
<hi>fall downe</hi> and <hi>worship</hi> the <hi>Image</hi> of a <hi>Nero,</hi>
nay of a <hi>Devil,</hi> rather then <hi>want</hi> the <hi>single penny</hi>
that beares it. You will have much adoe to convince him of the truth of the
<hi>Apostle's</hi> Proposition, <hi>That God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse is great gaine,</hi>
except you will grant him that this is a Logical Conversion, and not to be
question'd <hi>that Great gain is God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyness.</hi> If with the
<hi>Silver-smith</hi> he can by his <hi>craft</hi> get his <hi>wealth,</hi>
then shall <hi>Religion</hi> become his <hi>trade,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi>
his <hi>forge:</hi> But till then you must give him leave to be a
<hi>worshipper</hi> of his great Goddesse <hi>Diana.</hi> So farre is he from
putting in practice that good <pb n="55" facs="tcp:42817:37"/> and wholesome advice, to
<hi>be Carefull in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but in every thing to give thanks;</hi> that he
dares never read the text but backwards, <hi>Give thanks for nothing but in
every thing be carefull,</hi> He cannot esteem it a true piece of providence to
make the <hi>daie Content with it's own labour,</hi> but on the Contrary he
gives <hi>every day</hi> the <hi>trouble</hi> of <hi>careing</hi> for <hi>many
yeares;</hi> and <hi>therefore</hi> is ready to Phancy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe farr from the
<hi>Rich Fool's</hi> Condition in the <hi>Gospell,</hi> because he never yet
could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his <hi>Soul</hi> her <hi>Requiem,</hi> or think that he had
<hi>enough</hi> for <hi>many yeares.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He takes much more <hi>paines</hi> to leave his <hi>Children
Rich</hi> then <hi>Good,</hi> and had rather give them a <hi>Portion</hi> then
a <hi>blessing.</hi> The main <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> he gives them is to be
<hi>thrifty</hi> and Good-<hi>husbands,</hi> let them make themselves
<hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>Good-Christians.</hi> All the <hi>learning</hi> he
intends to bestow upon them, is so much <hi>Latine</hi> as will fit them for
understanding a <hi>Bond</hi> and so much <hi>Arithmetick</hi> as may
<hi>secure</hi> them from the <hi>Dishonesty</hi> of an <hi>unjust
Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;</hi> If he suppose the <hi>Book</hi> may be made a <hi>thrifty
diversion</hi> to keep them from the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>expense</hi> of the
<hi>Taverne</hi> or their <hi>Game,</hi> he may perhaps allow
<hi>something</hi> towards a <hi>study.</hi> 
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:42817:38"/> And (be sure)
he will be carefull enough, to give them so much <hi>Law</hi> as may be
suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to <hi>maintaine</hi> their owne <hi>rights,</hi> and <hi>rack</hi>
their <hi>Tenants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If he go Constantly to <hi>Church,</hi> tis more to <hi>serve
himselfe</hi> then his <hi>God.</hi> Often because he hopes by being
<hi>his</hi> frequent <hi>Auditor,</hi> he may <hi>oblige</hi> the
<hi>Parson</hi> to let him his <hi>tithes</hi> at a <hi>low rate,</hi> or to
<hi>believe</hi> him a man of <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> that so he may
<hi>defraud</hi> him of his <hi>dues</hi> without <hi>suspicion.</hi> For the
most part this <hi>Gentleman</hi> is the <hi>Patron</hi> or has the
<hi>Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation,</hi> and yet, whilest he and his family grow <hi>fat</hi>
by feasting upon the <hi>bread</hi> of the <hi>Altar,</hi> he grudges
<hi>him</hi> who dispenses <hi>freely</hi> of the <hi>bread of life</hi> the
very <hi>Crums</hi> that <hi>fall</hi> from his <hi>table.</hi> The
<hi>Church</hi> of God thus often <hi>starves</hi> for want of <hi>food,</hi>
whilest such <hi>Dogs</hi> Eat up the <hi>Children's bread:</hi> Such men's
whole <hi>Lives</hi> are but so many <hi>Continued Sacriledges,</hi> and all
they can alledge for themselves comes but to this, that they <hi>hold</hi>
their <hi>sin</hi> as their <hi>land</hi> by right of <hi>Inheritance,</hi>
from their <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors:</hi> Their <hi>Coffers</hi> grow full by robbing the
Sanctuary, and at every meal with their <hi>sacrilegious</hi> teeth, like so
many ravenous <hi>wolves</hi> or <hi>vultures,</hi> they <hi>teare</hi> in
pieces the <pb n="57" facs="tcp:42817:38"/> 
                  <hi>Body</hi> of Christ's languishing
<hi>Spouse:</hi> But let her <hi>dye,</hi> the <hi>Provident Gentleman</hi> had
rather see her <hi>Carkasse</hi> then his <hi>Chests</hi> grow <hi>Empty;</hi>
and if by her <hi>death</hi> he may peaceably enjoy her <hi>revenues,</hi> he
will hardly <hi>mourn,</hi> but as such enriched <hi>heires</hi> use to doe, at
her <hi>fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is long since this Good man turn'd <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> out of
dores, as an <hi>unthrifty Hous-wife,</hi> and one that made it her busyness to
<hi>throw</hi> all away. The <hi>Poor</hi> come and goe about his
<hi>gates,</hi> as hungry <hi>birds</hi> about a <hi>painted Vine,</hi> at best
they meet with an <hi>hard Crust</hi> and <hi>harder language.</hi> He loves
not thus to <hi>lend</hi> his <hi>money,</hi> though it be to the
<hi>Lord,</hi> except he would give him <hi>bond</hi> to returne him
<hi>Eight</hi> in the <hi>Hundred</hi> here in <hi>this</hi> world. When our
<hi>Saviour</hi> tells him of an <hi>Hundred</hi> for <hi>one</hi> here below,
and <hi>eternall life</hi> hereafter in Heaven, he hath as little
<hi>faith</hi> to believe, as <hi>patience</hi> to waite for such a reward: Yet
he could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most wish upon Condition the <hi>former</hi> part of the promise
might be made good to him, <hi>without Persecution;</hi> that the
<hi>later</hi> might be reserved for such who can Phancy a <hi>God</hi> in
<hi>Heaven</hi> better then a <hi>thousand pound</hi> in <hi>hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:42817:39"/> If this Gentleman can but so farre <hi>deny
himselfe</hi> as to do no open <hi>violence</hi> or <hi>Injury</hi> to any man;
if he can arrive at that degree of <hi>Christianity;</hi> which will enable him
to reach the <hi>Negative</hi> part of <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
he is apt to think he has made a faire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse in the way to Heaven. And yet
(God knows) he ordinarily mistakes this part too. For to win <hi>another's</hi>
estate by some <hi>quillet</hi> in the Law, or by <hi>bribing</hi> a Judge; to
<hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-reach</hi> his poor neighbour in an hard <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;</hi> to take
<hi>advantage</hi> of a needy person's present <hi>necessity,</hi> and
accordingly raise the <hi>price</hi> of his Commodity; to <hi>exact</hi> first
<hi>more</hi> then he is <hi>able</hi> to pay, and then make him pay
<hi>use</hi> for his <hi>disability;</hi> to send a poore na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked soul to
<hi>bridewell</hi> insteed of an <hi>Hospitall,</hi> to the <hi>stocks</hi>
insteed of a <hi>Bed,</hi> to call him <hi>knave</hi> and <hi>Vagabond,</hi>
that he may have a <hi>pretence</hi> not to <hi>relieve</hi> him: to suffer a
languishing Creature to <hi>dye</hi> in the street, whilst he had enough to
<hi>spare</hi> wherewith to <hi>feed</hi> and cloath him; Or to permit a
<hi>breach</hi> in the walls of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> when a small <hi>summe</hi>
out of his <hi>purse</hi> would <hi>repare</hi> it; <hi>These</hi> he can by no
means reckon amongst the <hi>species</hi> of <hi>Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi> or as
<hi>defects</hi> in <hi>Charity;</hi> but therefore <pb n="59" facs="tcp:42817:39"/> counts
all good duties as things <hi>unnecessary</hi> and no way obliging, indeed
because <hi>charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> and seemingly <hi>Burthensome;</hi> and such as
contradict that thrifty <hi>forecast,</hi> and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary <hi>providence</hi>
he holds himselfe tyed to maintain. He thinks it a greater degree of
<hi>wisedom</hi> to trust God's <hi>providence</hi> now for some
<hi>miraculouse</hi> reliefe of the <hi>present</hi> poore, then to rely upon
it for the <hi>after-enrichment</hi> of his posterity.</p>
               <p>Certainly this is the <hi>thing</hi> that passes so Currently for
<hi>Providence,</hi> even amongst those who are counted the <hi>wiser</hi> and
more <hi>religious</hi> sort of our <hi>English Gentlemen:</hi> But if
<hi>this</hi> can belong to <hi>Christianity,</hi> then must
<hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse</hi> and a <hi>Worldly</hi> minde, be reckoned amongst our
<hi>Christian vertues.</hi> It is (alas) too evident what good friends such
<hi>vertues</hi> and such <hi>Gentlemen</hi> have been of late to our
<hi>Ierusalem;</hi> whilest our <hi>richest Gallantry</hi> have all along, in
these calamitous times, chosen rather, by a kind of <hi>Constrained bounty</hi>
to <hi>reward</hi> the <hi>Demolishers;</hi> then <hi>voluntarily</hi> to part
with a <hi>farthing</hi> to pay the <hi>builders</hi> of our ruinated
<hi>Sion.</hi> Besides this, it is not a little to be fear'd that those many
Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Oathes</hi> and <hi>Engagements, Vowes</hi> and
<hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations,</hi> 
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:42817:40"/> which with the help of this
<hi>sauce</hi> of <hi>providence</hi> have been so readily <hi>swallowed</hi>
(I fear I may say) by the greatest part of our Gentry, will at last expose
their <hi>soules</hi> within no lesse to <hi>Corruption,</hi> then the
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <hi>Qualities</hi> do their <hi>Bodies</hi> without. O how happy
might this poore <hi>Nation</hi> have been even to this day, had not the
<hi>Rich Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman</hi> under a pretence of a <hi>Naturall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> and
a <hi>Necessary Providence,</hi> set an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er aestimate upon his own
<hi>Chest,</hi> then the <hi>Arke</hi> of God; upon his owne <hi>Barne,</hi>
then the Lord's <hi>Temple;</hi> Had he not loved his <hi>Interest</hi> more
then his <hi>Religion,</hi> the <hi>safety</hi> of his <hi>Body</hi> more then
the <hi>Salvation</hi> of his <hi>Soul,</hi> his <hi>Naturall children</hi>

               <head>§. 4. The Prudent Gentleman.</head>
               <p>By this short view I have given you of the <hi>Provident
Gentleman,</hi> I suppose you will grant him to be none of those we may call
the <hi>best,</hi> or such as it might be wished, wee had <hi>many</hi> of in
our <hi>Nation;</hi> And truly the <hi>Prudent Gentleman,</hi> I mean him who
is <hi>now</hi> adayes knowne by that name, is not of a much <hi>Nobler
dye:</hi> very often you shall find <pb n="61" facs="tcp:42817:40"/> him to be the very
<hi>same,</hi> alwayes very <hi>neer</hi> of <hi>kind</hi> to the former.
<hi>Cowardice</hi> is as much afraid to be <hi>known,</hi> and therefore as
loath to walk without her maske as <hi>Covetousness;</hi> and would as gladly
arrogate to her selfe the <hi>never</hi> more abused <hi>names</hi> then
<hi>now</hi> of a <hi>wise caution,</hi> and a <hi>Christian Prudence;</hi> as
that <hi>other</hi> of a <hi>vertuous thrift</hi> and <hi>necessary
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Insteed of being (as <hi>wisedome</hi> commanded his
<hi>Disciples) wise as serpents,</hi> Gentlemen are become meer <hi>Serpents in
wisedom;</hi> and have render'd themselves very capable of that Commendable
<hi>Character,</hi> which was long agoe given to the <hi>Serpent, They are more
subtile then all the beasts of the field;</hi> and the <hi>Prudence</hi> they
boast of, and under which they vaile a <hi>Carnall mind,</hi> and a <hi>Carking
Cowardly soul,</hi> is nothing else but a <hi>worldly Policy,</hi> or rather a
<hi>Devillish Subtilty.</hi> They have made one halfe of the text quarrel with,
and justle the other quite out of their Bibles, advancing the <hi>wisedome</hi>
of the <hi>serpent</hi> to so high and <hi>Intense</hi> a degree, that it
cannot <hi>admit</hi> the <hi>least</hi> proportion of the <hi>Holy Doves</hi>
more necessary <hi>Innocence.</hi> Such a foraminous piece of
<hi>Net-worke</hi> has <hi>Christian Prudence</hi> 
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:42817:41"/> been
made of late, that these <hi>Glib serpentine Politicians</hi> can soe
<hi>wind</hi> themselves <hi>in</hi> and <hi>out</hi> at pleasure, as if they
meant neither <hi>God</hi> nor <hi>Man</hi> should ever know certainly where to
have them.</p>
               <p>It is a very famous piece of the <hi>Gentleman's prudence</hi> to
Endeavour to <hi>Out-wit</hi> an <hi>All-wise</hi> God, and to go about to put
<hi>Fallacies</hi> upon him out of his owne <hi>word,</hi> often make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even
God's most <hi>righteous precepts</hi> the <hi>Topicks</hi> of his
<hi>disobedience.</hi> How frequently endeavours he to cloak the violation of
<hi>one</hi> law, by a <hi>pretended obedience</hi> to <hi>another,</hi> and by
setting God's <hi>Commands</hi> at variance <hi>one</hi> with <hi>another,</hi>
thinks to <hi>steal</hi> away his beloved <hi>sin,</hi> and not be taken
<hi>notice</hi> of? He dares not <hi>take up his Crosse and follow Christ,</hi>
lest he should become <hi>Felo de se,</hi> accessary to his owne death; Nor
knows he how to <hi>forsake Father and Mother for Christ's sake,</hi> without a
breach of the <hi>Fifth Commandment,</hi> which binding him to <hi>Honour
both,</hi> he cannot see how he may in any sence <hi>forsake either.</hi> He
dares not <hi>part</hi> with <hi>houses</hi> and <hi>lands,</hi> for fear he
might seem to <hi>Dispise</hi> God's good <hi>Blessings;</hi> nor
<hi>hazard</hi> his <hi>estate</hi> in the <hi>vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of his
<hi>Religion</hi> and his <hi>Loyalty,</hi> lest he <pb n="63" facs="tcp:42817:41"/> should
be said to have thereby <hi>thrown away</hi> the <hi>opportunities</hi> of
expressing his <hi>bounty</hi> and his <hi>Charity;</hi> He knows how much he
is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged not to <hi>deny Christ before men,</hi> and to <hi>give an
account</hi> of his <hi>faith</hi> to such as <hi>demand</hi> it of him; but
then he produces a <hi>text</hi> which tells him of <hi>daies wherein the
Prudent shall keep silence,</hi> and these <hi>daies</hi> he supposes still
<hi>present,</hi> whensoever his <hi>person</hi> or <hi>estate</hi> may be
<hi>endanger'd</hi> by an <hi>open heart</hi> or an <hi>Ingenuous tongue.</hi>
He will be ready to suffer <hi>Persecution</hi> for the <hi>Gospell</hi> of
Christ, and, with <hi>St Paul,</hi> to be <hi>bound</hi> and to <hi>dye;</hi>
but this must onely bee when his <hi>Prudence</hi> is at a <hi>losse</hi> and
he can find out no way <hi>just</hi> or <hi>unjust</hi> to avoyd all this. As
long as there are <hi>shifts</hi> enow left him, such as <hi>dissembling</hi>
language, <hi>Covert</hi> Engagements, <hi>Cunning</hi> flatteries,
<hi>treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> Compositions, <hi>petty</hi> Contributions,
<hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand</hi> Compliances, in things both <hi>Civill</hi> and
<hi>Religious,</hi> he thinks he wants no <hi>honest Evasions,</hi> to secure
both <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>livelyhood,</hi> Thus he is Content to set him down
in <hi>qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnesse,</hi> whilest the <hi>Enemies</hi> of God's <hi>Church</hi>
advance in <hi>troops</hi> and <hi>Armies</hi> against her; and thinks it
enough, when he can say he <hi>wishes</hi> all well, and <hi>praies for the
Peace of Ierusalem.</hi> 
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:42817:42"/> It were no <hi>Prudence
openly</hi> to declare his <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> or to <hi>act</hi> on any side;
alas, he is but <hi>one single</hi> man, and <hi>one's</hi> as good as
<hi>none</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the stream of the <hi>multitude,</hi> not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that where <hi>one</hi> does not <hi>joyne</hi> with <hi>one,</hi> there can be
no <hi>multitude.</hi> There are <hi>other</hi> Champions enow in the world to
vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate her quarrell, such as have no <hi>estates</hi> to look after, No
<hi>families</hi> to provide for, when if all were of <hi>his mind</hi> there
would not be so much as <hi>one;</hi> and besides who has grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reason to
<hi>labour</hi> then he that has already received so great a share of his
<hi>wages.</hi> What though he freely <hi>gives</hi> away a large portion of
his goods to the <hi>Enemies</hi> of God? It is but the way to <hi>secure</hi>
the <hi>rest</hi> for <hi>better</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses. What though he be constrain'd
with faire <hi>speeches</hi> to <hi>flatter</hi> up the <hi>transgressors</hi>
in their Iniquities? His <hi>heart</hi> for all this shall be for <hi>God,</hi>
his <hi>prayers</hi> for the <hi>Church,</hi> and he is as <hi>Good</hi> a
<hi>Christian</hi> and as <hi>Loyall</hi> a <hi>Subject within</hi> as the
best. Alas, 'tis no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Comply</hi> a little in outward

<hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Loyalty;</hi> God knows, he <hi>intends</hi> no such

<hi>smile</hi> upon the preacher, and <hi>inviteing</hi> him home with him
witness his <hi>thankes</hi> and <hi>approbation</hi> in a <hi>Good

worship</hi> and <hi>service</hi> of God, which the <hi>excellency</hi> thereof
and the <hi>Command</hi> of his superiours commends to his <hi>Conscience,</hi>
lest he should be thereby thought <hi>ill-affected</hi> to that
<hi>Religion,</hi> which he would have <hi>Good men</hi> believe his soul
<hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horres.</hi> He dares Countenance <hi>Rebellion</hi> and
<hi>Sacriledge</hi> both with his <hi>tongue</hi> and <hi>Purse;</hi> but
aesteems it <hi>dangerous,</hi> and therefore (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt)
<hi>Imprudence,</hi> to Contribute so much as a <hi>Good look</hi> to the

               <p>The <hi>Peaceable</hi> and <hi>Honest-natur'd Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> (as

<hi>England</hi> is not much more indebted for his kindnesse then to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of
the former: this is <hi>he</hi> that is so farre from being <hi>Cordially</hi>
sensible of the <hi>Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Ioseph,</hi> or the <hi>dessolations of
Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> that he seems to have hardly so much of an <hi>humane
spirit</hi> in him as to understand the <hi>meaning</hi> of those two
<hi>words, Happiness</hi> and <hi>Misery. Three parts</hi> of his time at
least, he spends in <hi>sleep,</hi> as if he were resolved to <hi>die</hi> all
his <hi>life</hi> long; or by this course to keep himselfe <hi>Ignorant</hi> of
the <hi>Concerning</hi> affaires of the world, being loath to come
<hi>acquainted</hi> with the truth of those evills which he is resolved not to
take any pains to <hi>remove.</hi> The other <hi>quarter</hi> of his time he
carefully <hi>divides</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his <hi>meales</hi> &amp; his

               <p>Sometimes he seems even to <hi>Envy</hi> the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>stones</hi>
that Constant rest which <hi>Nature</hi> has indulged them, whereby they are
made <pb n="70" facs="tcp:42817:45"/> incapable of any <hi>motion</hi> but what is
occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, and that but rarely, by some <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> from without them.
If he had so much of that <hi>Philosophy,</hi> which tells us the
<hi>caelesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bodyes</hi> are in a <hi>perpetuall motion,</hi> as to
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it for a truth, he would for that very cause be unwilling to go to
<hi>Heaven.</hi> When he hears of an <hi>aeternall Saboth of rest</hi> for all
those that goe thither, he is <hi>almost perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to become a Christian,</hi>
yet is he in a great <hi>straight betwixt two,</hi> for though he <hi>love</hi>
his <hi>rest</hi> too <hi>well,</hi> yet he <hi>hates</hi> the very
<hi>name</hi> of <hi>Saboth</hi> much <hi>more,</hi> especially when he hears
<hi>St<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Iohn</hi> telling him, that, the <hi>Angells</hi> and
<hi>Glorified Saints never cease Day nor Night from praising God</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes again he seems to grudg the poore <hi>bruit Animals</hi>
their <hi>Irrationalitie,</hi> and to <hi>share</hi> with them, endeavours by a
<hi>Sordid sensuality</hi> to degrade himselfe into a <hi>Beast<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> or
at least, to become as <hi>like</hi> one as <hi>humanity</hi> will permit him.
That he may be better <hi>acquainted</hi> with their <hi>Natures</hi> and
<hi>dispositions,</hi> his <hi>Dog</hi> and his <hi>Horse,</hi> or his
<hi>Hawke,</hi> henceforward become his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall <hi>Companions;</hi> with
these he <hi>plaies,</hi> and with these he <hi>discourses,</hi> and towards
these <pb n="71" facs="tcp:42817:45"/> (if you seriously consider all his <hi>termes of
Art,</hi> you will be ready to say) he has his <hi>set formes</hi> of
<hi>Complement:</hi> and indeed his whole <hi>study</hi> is to learne readily
to speak that <hi>lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage</hi> wherein he may be <hi>understood</hi> by the

<hi>die,</hi> or the <hi>playing</hi> of his <hi>Cards;</hi> or perhaps gets so
much liberty abroad, as to measure out his <hi>houres</hi> by the motions of
his <hi>bowle.</hi> Such a mercilesse <hi>Tyrant</hi> is he to <hi>that</hi>
(which he feares he shall never loose or destroy fast enough) his <hi>precious
time;</hi> that he allwaies studies to invent variety of <hi>Executions</hi>
for it. Now he delights to <hi>drown</hi> it in his <hi>Cups,</hi> anon he

again he <hi>knocks</hi> it in the head with his <hi>Bowl, teares</hi> and

nothing he will leave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experimented, 'till he have certainly found out a way

departure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These Courses he willingly allowes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in, and desires to

<hi>study</hi> of <hi>retirednesse</hi> from those <hi>Distracting
Cumbrances</hi> thereof, which are unworthy of a <hi>Christian,</hi> or a
<hi>Gentleman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes he delights to consume a great part of his time in
unnecessary <hi>visits,</hi> but studies withall to make them so
<hi>unprofitable,</hi> as if he were desirous to have it thought men were
<hi>made</hi> onely now and then to <hi>look</hi> upon one another: his
<hi>discourse</hi> (what there is of it) being so <hi>idle</hi> and
<hi>impertinent,</hi> that it serves to no other end, then to
<hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise</hi> his <hi>tongue</hi> and keep it by much <hi>motion
voluble;</hi> lest for want of <hi>use</hi> he should in a short time (as he
does by most good things) forget to <hi>speak.</hi> Sometimes you shall have a
<hi>Complement</hi> from him, but puff'd up with so many <hi>hyperbolicall</hi>
expressions of <hi>your worth,</hi> and of the <hi>incredible</hi> respects he
has for <hi>your person,</hi> that you cannot chuse but suspect he only
<hi>labours</hi> how to be <hi>disbelieved;</hi> or has learn'd of his
<hi>Dogges</hi> how to <hi>fawn</hi> and <hi>flatter.</hi> And thus when he has
made a shift to <hi>lose</hi> an <hi>houre</hi> or two, and to <hi>trouble</hi>
his <hi>friends</hi> with much <hi>Impertinent</hi> talke, he returnes home
again to <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>play,</hi> and <hi>sleep,</hi> and spend the
remainder of his time as <hi>Idly</hi> as he can.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:42817:46"/> In a word this sort of <hi>Gentlemen</hi>
borders so closely upon him we first described, the <hi>Gallant,</hi> that I
shall not need to say more of him, then only this, that he has some
<hi>degrees</hi> lesse of <hi>Madnesse</hi> then the other; he seems as yet but
to <hi>hang</hi> about the <hi>dores,</hi> and has not gain'd an
<hi>admission</hi> into the <hi>Society</hi> of <hi>Raunters:</hi> Nor is this
because he wants a <hi>Genius</hi> or <hi>Inclination</hi> to evill in the
Generall, but rather he is beholding to <hi>one vice</hi> to keep him from
<hi>another,</hi> and being wedded so much to <hi>this,</hi> is forced to
abstain from it's <hi>Contrary.</hi> Either he is <hi>tyed</hi> to his
<hi>Chest</hi> with a <hi>Golden chaine,</hi> which will not allow him the
liberty of <hi>ranging into</hi> so many <hi>cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> riots; or else a

                     </gap>aden dulnesse</hi> so much
oppresses his soule, that she cannot <hi>Soare</hi> so <hi>high</hi> in the
vast <hi>Region</hi> of <hi>Debauchery:</hi> So that if you find him free from
any <hi>one</hi> vice, he is to thank the <hi>Contrary vice</hi> and not the
<hi>vertue</hi> for it; or at best, he owes it to an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie</hi> of
<hi>Nature</hi> that he is free from <hi>both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed for the most part this <hi>Gentleman</hi> is (as the
<hi>Philosophers</hi> use to say of their <hi>first matter)</hi> though not
perfectly <hi>formed</hi> into all those <hi>Noble</hi> qualifications (as they
are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually <pb n="74" facs="tcp:42817:47"/> miscall'd) of the <hi>Compleat Gallant,</hi>
yet is he, at lest, in a <hi>remote Disposition</hi> to all or any of them: As
the <hi>Polypus</hi> is said to be alwaies of the same colour with the
neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring <hi>object;</hi> or as the <hi>Looking-glasse</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects as
many different <hi>faces</hi> as are obvia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to its own <hi>superficies:</hi>
So is this <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> not properly <hi>one,</hi> but <hi>any</hi>
Body; of the <hi>Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Humour,</hi> and the
<hi>fashion</hi> of his <hi>Companions,</hi> as neer as his own
<hi>weaknesse</hi> will permit him to <hi>Imitate</hi> them. And this is it
which Commonly purchases him the repute of a <hi>Civill,</hi> a
<hi>Courteous,</hi> an <hi>Affable,</hi> a <hi>Good-natured</hi> and
<hi>sweet-disposition'd</hi> person: Only because he know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in his <hi>own</hi> face, and <hi>speak</hi> with every one in his <hi>own</hi>
language; He <hi>Complements,</hi> and <hi>Praises,</hi> and <hi>Flatters,</hi>
and performes <hi>all</hi> the offices of a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> as his
<hi>shadow</hi> in the <hi>Glasse,</hi> only by <hi>reflection. For a fair
word</hi> he will part with his own <hi>soul,</hi> and <hi>with</hi> a <hi>fair
word</hi> he does often occasion the <hi>ruine</hi> of many more: whilest he
loves as much to flatter <hi>others</hi> up <pb n="75" facs="tcp:42817:47"/> in
<hi>their</hi> wickednesse, as to be flattered up <hi>by others</hi> in his
<hi>own. Say</hi> and <hi>doe</hi> what you will (so you injure not his
<hi>person</hi> or <hi>estate,</hi> nor rob him of his beloved <hi>ease)</hi>
you are sure to have his <hi>approbation,</hi> and if for this <hi>he</hi> may

great enough. But I leave him.</p>

all this, but because <hi>Robbery</hi> and <hi>Sacriledge</hi> are much more

               <p>But the Gentleman on the <hi>losing side</hi> will, I know, think
it too much (and well he may) that another should grow so <hi>honourable</hi>
at his <hi>cost</hi> and <hi>charges,</hi> and give him so few <hi>thanks</hi>

truly just the <hi>same,</hi> which at first <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd</hi> the

<hi>before:</hi> He so behaves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe under the <hi>correcting</hi> hand of
God, as if he thought, the mercifull God did onely <hi>chastise</hi> his
<hi>children</hi> to make them <hi>cry</hi> and <hi>complaine</hi> of his
unkindnesse, not at all to make them <hi>sensible</hi> of their

such a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment</hi> of God's dealings with us is a

the way to <hi>provoke</hi> him unto <hi>more</hi> and <hi>greater,</hi> not to

<hi>priviledg</hi> of <hi>Loosers</hi> to <hi>talk</hi> what they
<hi>list,</hi> though never so <hi>prophanely:</hi> and looks upon this

<hi>drink</hi> and <hi>play</hi> away his <hi>Cares</hi> and the scant

would be halfe so bad as he is, were it not more in <hi>opposition</hi> to his
<hi>Enemy,</hi> then out of <hi>love</hi> to his own <hi>vices.</hi> He often
abhorres and abstains from the vices of <hi>other men,</hi> not (as good
<hi>Christians</hi> doe) for the <hi>sin's</hi> sake but for the
<hi>sinner's;</hi> from <hi>whom</hi> he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to set himselfe at such a
<hi>distance,</hi> that he never rests 'till he be gotten into the
<hi>Contrary</hi> extreme, and often into the more <hi>Scandalous</hi> though
not alwaies the more <hi>dangerous</hi> of the two. As if <hi>vice</hi> could
have no <hi>opposite</hi> but of it's <hi>own name,</hi> nor any means were
left him to become <hi>one</hi> way <hi>better</hi> then his adversaries, but

very well complain of some who would be thought her own <hi>Sons,</hi> as
<hi>God</hi> of his ungratefull people of old, <hi>She has brought up Children
and they have rebelled against her, and among all the sons she has nursed up,
there is none to pitty her or lead her by the hand.</hi> When they were

               <p>He looks upon himselfe whilest in <hi>this</hi> world as no more

               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Blessings</hi> of <hi>this</hi> world, he looks

that he is no <hi>lesse</hi> in all things then <hi>himselfe.</hi> One whose

such, that (could we <hi>want</hi> him) it were <hi>pitty</hi> but that he were

that he can <hi>Imitate</hi> their <hi>Vertues,</hi> and it will be the
<hi>Crown</hi> of his <hi>Old-Age</hi> to be as good a <hi>father</hi> as his
<hi>own. Blood</hi> and <hi>Birth</hi> then stood him instead, when his

<hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> upon his <hi>Honour,</hi> not as upon his <hi>estate,</hi> by

<hi>claime</hi> of his <hi>merits;</hi> looking upon it not as his <hi>lot</hi>

<hi>Quality,</hi> to <hi>owe</hi> all that <hi>Respect</hi> which is
<hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> him when he is a man, to his full Coffers; or all the

               <p>His highest <hi>Ambition</hi> is to be a <hi>Favourite</hi> in the

to <hi>dresse</hi> up himselfe in all those <hi>Spirituall Ornaments,</hi>
which may make his Soule truly <hi>amiable</hi> in the eyes of the <hi>Great

<hi>before-hand,</hi> knowing that the <hi>longer</hi> it is <hi>worne,</hi>
the more <hi>Splendid</hi> it <hi>Growes,</hi> and the <hi>more</hi> it is

the more <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>vigorous</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of his

so <hi>cloathing</hi> it, that the <hi>other</hi> part may be kept from

               <p>If his <hi>Place</hi> or <hi>Office</hi> challenge an

               <head>§. 5. His Discourse and Language.</head>
               <p>When you heare him <hi>speak,</hi> you will think that he intends
no lesse, then to give you a <hi>tast</hi> of his <hi>Soul</hi> at every
<hi>word:</hi> Nor indeed is it possible you should in any thing plainlier
Discover the <hi>Noblenesse</hi> of his <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> then in his <hi>sweet
breath,</hi> so <hi>Divinely</hi> moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into most excellent
<hi>discourse.</hi> Every <pb n="114" facs="tcp:42817:67"/> word <hi>he</hi> speaks, speaks
<hi>him;</hi> and gives you a saire <hi>Character</hi> at once both of his
<hi>Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and his <hi>Breeding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you respect the <hi>Quality</hi> of his <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,</hi> it
is <hi>Grave</hi> and <hi>Noble, Serious</hi> and <hi>Weighty;</hi> and yet
alwaies rather what is <hi>fit</hi> to be spoken, then what he is <hi>able</hi>
to speak. His <hi>Words</hi> are most <hi>Proper</hi> and <hi>Genuine,</hi> but
not affected; His <hi>Phrase high</hi> and <hi>lofty,</hi> but not
<hi>Bombastick;</hi> His <hi>Sentenses close</hi> and <hi>full,</hi> but not
<hi>obscure</hi> or <hi>Confused.</hi> His Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is neither
<hi>Flashy</hi> nor <hi>Flat,</hi> neither <hi>Boyish</hi> nor
<hi>Effaeminate,</hi> neither <hi>rude</hi> nor <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantick:</hi> It is
alwaies <hi>Sober,</hi> yet <hi>Ingenious; Virile, strong</hi> and
<hi>Masculine, yet sweet</hi> and <hi>Winning:</hi> He loves a <hi>Smooth</hi>
expression, but not a <hi>Soft</hi> one: a <hi>Smart</hi> or <hi>Witty</hi>
say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but without a <hi>Clinch</hi> or <hi>Iingle.</hi> His words are those
which his <hi>Matter</hi> will best <hi>beare,</hi> not such as his
<hi>Phaney</hi> would readily est <hi>suggest.</hi> No poor halfe starved
<hi>Iests,</hi> no drie <hi>Insipid Quibbles</hi> can get any room in his
<hi>Rhetorick:</hi> hardly a <hi>word</hi> in all, but what hath it's
<hi>Emphasis,</hi> nor any <hi>sentence</hi> without it's <hi>full
weight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you would eye the <hi>Quantity</hi> of his Speech, it is not
<hi>Long</hi> but <hi>Full;</hi> not <hi>Much</hi> 
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:42817:67"/> but
<hi>Great:</hi> He speaks not <hi>alwaies,</hi> but when he speaks he saies
<hi>All.</hi> He as often showes how <hi>well</hi> he can be <hi>silent,</hi>
as how <hi>well</hi> he can <hi>speak;</hi> and <hi>others</hi> alwaies love
more to hear him talke, then <hi>he himselfe.</hi> He makes no lesse use of his
<hi>Eare</hi> in all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, then of his <hi>Tongue;</hi> and by his
seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>harkening</hi> to the more <hi>impertinent</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses of his
Companions, plainly proves he has no lesse <hi>Patience</hi> then
<hi>Rhetorick.</hi> He makes it evident, that he has his <hi>tongue</hi> (that
<hi>unruly Beast</hi> in most men's Mouthes) as much at his <hi>Command,</hi>
as his <hi>Wit,</hi> and that he is able to make both <hi>rest,</hi> as well as
both <hi>move</hi> at his pleasure.</p>
               <p>His sayings are never <hi>long</hi> or <hi>taedious,</hi> but they
alwaies reach <hi>Home;</hi> and he will very seldome take any thing lesse then
a <hi>Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,</hi> for an <hi>Opportunity</hi> of speaking. But then
usually he delivers all with that <hi>faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> and <hi>perspicuity,</hi>
as if his <hi>words</hi> were not the <hi>elect</hi> and <hi>voluntary,</hi>
but the <hi>ready</hi> and <hi>Naturall</hi> emanations of his Soul. No
<hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> shall at any time more Disturbe the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of his
<hi>words,</hi> then it can <hi>Cloud</hi> the <hi>Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of his
<hi>forehead.</hi> He cannot make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe <hi>merry,</hi> much lesse
<hi>proud,</hi> with his own <pb n="116" facs="tcp:42817:68"/> 
                  <hi>Inventions;</hi> nor
does he ever <hi>catch</hi> at the <hi>applause,</hi> but <hi>aimes</hi> at the
<hi>Edification</hi> of his <hi>Auditers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you will look upon the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Substance</hi>
of his Discourse; you shall see, 'tis alwaies what he <hi>finds,</hi> not what
he <hi>makes:</hi> Not what he supposes may afford the <hi>fairest field</hi>
for his <hi>Phancy</hi> and <hi>Invention</hi> to roave in; but the
<hi>Best-Garden</hi> of such choise <hi>fruits</hi> as the <hi>Stomacks</hi>
(Not the <hi>Palates</hi> onely) of his <hi>Company</hi> shall be best able to
<hi>beare:</hi> Or such as may prove most <hi>Medicinall,</hi> when seasonably
applied to the severall <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases</hi> of those that <hi>heare</hi> him:
These he alwaies studies rather to <hi>heal</hi> then <hi>Discover,</hi> and
yet rather to <hi>Discover</hi> then <hi>Flatter.</hi> Hence he often
distributes amongst them the <hi>Bitter</hi> as well as the <hi>Sweet:</hi> and
rather that which may <hi>nourish,</hi> then what may <hi>please.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet here it is, if ever, that he acts the part of the
<hi>Tempter:</hi> for he makes even the <hi>Sourest</hi> Apple (which he knowes
to be <hi>wholsome)</hi> so <hi>pleasant</hi> to the <hi>Eye,</hi> that he
<hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> such as need it, by a <hi>Pious Fraud,</hi> into a reall
<hi>love</hi> of what <hi>naturally</hi> they most <hi>hate.</hi> Indeed the
onely way which for the most <pb n="117" facs="tcp:42817:68"/> part in <hi>such</hi>
Company is left him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the <hi>losse</hi> of his <hi>own</hi> time, is
to make <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> with whom he Converses <hi>gainers</hi> by his
<hi>Society:</hi> and he does his utmost endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that <hi>every</hi> one
that heares him, may by what they heare, either <hi>gaine</hi> a
<hi>vertue,</hi> or <hi>lose</hi> a <hi>Vice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is it, which makes him very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to avoid, whatsoever
might rationally be supposed <hi>able</hi> to <hi>vitiate</hi> either his
<hi>own Discourse</hi> or the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nds</hi> of his <hi>Auditors.</hi> And very good reason <hi>he</hi>
has to be more <hi>cautious</hi> in this respect then <hi>other</hi> men,
see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the most <hi>Odious</hi> vice from <hi>his Language</hi> would gaine so
great a <hi>Lovelinesse</hi> as would probably make it one of the strongest
<hi>temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi> But his <hi>Rhetorick</hi> has too <hi>sweet</hi> a
<hi>face</hi> to be made the <hi>Mother</hi> or <hi>Midwife</hi> to any thing
that has the <hi>Monstrous</hi> shape of <hi>Sinne:</hi> he should fouly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <hi>Adulterate</hi> so great a <hi>Purity,</hi> who should goe about to
<hi>match</hi> it with any thing lesse then <hi>Piety</hi> and
<hi>Virtue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obloquy</hi> and <hi>Scurrility</hi> are too <hi>deformed</hi>
and <hi>wryfaced</hi> to gain any place in his <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;</hi> He that is
<hi>able,</hi> when he will, to <hi>create</hi> to himselfe a
<hi>Reputation</hi> not inferiour <pb n="118" facs="tcp:42817:69"/> to the <hi>highest,
scornes</hi> as much, as he <hi>needs</hi> little to <hi>Rob</hi> any
<hi>other</hi> man of <hi>his.</hi> His fingers are too <hi>clean</hi> to be
<hi>fouled</hi> by throwing <hi>dirt</hi> in other mens faces. He is as much
afraid to <hi>discover</hi> a <hi>Blemish</hi> in <hi>another</hi> man's
<hi>eye,</hi> as he is to <hi>suffer</hi> a greater in his <hi>own;</hi> and
will rather <hi>charitably</hi> condescend to <hi>lick</hi> out the
<hi>Mote</hi> with his <hi>tongue,</hi> then <hi>deridingly</hi> to
<hi>talke</hi> of it. He holds it too much below a man to imploy his
<hi>Nayles</hi> in vexing an <hi>Old Sore,</hi> and <hi>scratching</hi> 'till
he make a <hi>New one.</hi> He leaves it to <hi>Dogs</hi> and <hi>Ravens</hi>
to prey upon <hi>Carrion.</hi> Alas, it is a very <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry wit,</hi> which
is fain to <hi>feed</hi> upon such <hi>Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seous Diet.</hi> Other Men's
<hi>Infirmities,</hi> especially if <hi>Naturall</hi> or <hi>accidentall,</hi>
are much more the objects of his <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Pitty,</hi> then of
his <hi>Merriment</hi> and <hi>Derision.</hi> He judges it a <hi>Cruelty</hi>
proper to <hi>weaknesse</hi> alone to <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> the <hi>Sick;</hi> no
true <hi>Ingenuity</hi> can be so <hi>Barbarous</hi> as to <hi>sport</hi> it
selfe in the <hi>Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes</hi> of the <hi>Miserable.</hi> He esteems that
(as well he may) a meer <hi>Dwarfish wit</hi> which cannot tell how to
<hi>show</hi> it selfe to the world but by <hi>trampling</hi> (and so
<hi>advancing</hi> it selfe) upon the <hi>Reputation</hi> of others. It is a
<hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Phancy,</hi> or at least has alwaies a very <pb n="119" facs="tcp:42817:69"/>
                  <hi>Hard Labour,</hi> which can be <hi>mother</hi> to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to what
<hi>Misfortune</hi> must be the <hi>Midwife.</hi> The <hi>True Gentleman</hi>
has both more <hi>wit,</hi> more <hi>Honesty,</hi> and more <hi>Charity,</hi>
then to permit his <hi>tongue</hi> to be so <hi>foolishly,</hi> so
<hi>unworthily,</hi> so <hi>Tyrannically</hi> busied.</p>
               <p>Nor doth he lesse <hi>abhorre</hi> to come neere that filthy
<hi>Puddle</hi> of <hi>obscaenity;</hi> 'tis a <hi>Sow</hi> and no
<hi>Minerva</hi> that can be for such nasty food. He never carried the
<hi>Goat's tongue</hi> in the <hi>Gentleman's head,</hi> but wishes that all
who do so would for ever use it as <hi>Goates</hi> doe, that is, continue
allwaies <hi>Mute.</hi> All his discourses are as <hi>Chast</hi> as
<hi>faire,</hi> and the sweet <hi>Loves</hi> in recitall whereof he so much
pleaseth <hi>himselfe</hi> and all those <hi>Good</hi> men which heare him, are
no other then those betwixt <hi>God</hi> and his own <hi>Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He is too <hi>just</hi> to himselfe and his own <hi>unusurped
Majesty,</hi> to suffer his talke to <hi>flag</hi> into an <hi>idle</hi> much
lesse a <hi>wanton</hi> strain of <hi>Drollery: that's</hi> too
<hi>Plebeian</hi> and <hi>Vulgar</hi> for a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> and
<hi>this</hi> no lesse too <hi>foul</hi> and <hi>Beastly</hi> even for a
<hi>Man:</hi> and he must be more then <hi>both</hi> these in every expression,
a <hi>Christian.</hi> He cannot but with as much <hi>wonder</hi> and
<hi>astonishment</hi> as <hi>pitty</hi> and <hi>Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> 
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:42817:70"/> hear those <hi>puny</hi> Souls, which can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent no
other Method of <hi>Gracing</hi> their Discourse, and make it <hi>takeing,</hi>
but by a <hi>Complacent</hi> rehearsall of their own and other men's
<hi>uncleannesses;</hi> nor can find <hi>matter</hi> for an <hi>Houre's</hi>
talke, without being behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for it to a <hi>Mistresse</hi> or an

<hi>Folly</hi> in <hi>fine words.</hi> Thus can they never be <hi>merry,</hi>
but as <hi>Children</hi> use to be, with a <hi>Baby</hi> or a
<hi>Rattle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Soul presently <hi>boyles</hi> up in a pious <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony</hi>
within him, whensoever he heares a <hi>vaine Oath</hi> or any thing that sounds
like <hi>prophanenesse:</hi> He never mentions the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>name</hi> of
<hi>Almighty God,</hi> but with that due <hi>Reverence</hi> both of
<hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> which suits with it's <hi>greatnesse.</hi> He
is too much the <hi>friend</hi> of God, and is every way too neerly
<hi>related</hi> unto him, to heare him <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured</hi> with
<hi>patience;</hi> or to suffer his <hi>Name</hi> to be made so <hi>vile</hi>
and <hi>cheap,</hi> as to be used (as too Commonly it is) onely as an
<hi>Expletive particle</hi> to prevent a <hi>Chasme,</hi> or make up a
<hi>Gap</hi> in the <hi>sentence,</hi> or to make all run more
<hi>smoothly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He has the like Holy respect for God's <hi>Word</hi> 
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:42817:70"/> as his <hi>Name.</hi> He is too much in <hi>love</hi>
with <hi>Scripture</hi> to see her <hi>prostituted</hi> to every
<hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious Phancy,</hi> and by an impudent <hi>wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting</hi> made the
subject of every <hi>Atheisticall</hi> wit. The <hi>Gentleman</hi> looks with a
more <hi>reverent</hi> eye upon this <hi>sacred</hi> Fountaine: not as set open
to be <hi>troubled</hi> and made <hi>Muddy</hi> by the <hi>Wanton Goates,</hi>
but to <hi>water</hi> and <hi>wash</hi> the tender <hi>Lambes.</hi> He useth it
further as a wholesome <hi>Bath</hi> for his <hi>White</hi> Soule, which will
preserve her both <hi>clean</hi> and <hi>whole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I should Injure the <hi>Gentleman,</hi> to dwell any longer upon
his <hi>Negative</hi> vertues. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this is an <hi>Indulgence</hi> given to
our <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> that we are allow'd to speak in the <hi>Negative</hi>
of all <hi>Great</hi> perfections, and say what they are <hi>not,</hi> when we
cannot, as we should, expresse what indeed they <hi>are.</hi> If you will heare
what I have to say more of his Discourse in short, then know, that all his
<hi>words</hi> are not onely the <hi>pretty pleasing,</hi> yet <hi>Empty
bublings</hi> of a <hi>restlesse Phancy,</hi> a <hi>rageing lust,</hi> or a
<hi>wanton</hi> and <hi>Frollick Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;</hi> But all of them the <hi>Grave,
weighty,</hi> and <hi>well proportion'd Breathings</hi> of his <hi>great</hi>

               <p>His whole <hi>Behaviour</hi> and <hi>Carriage</hi> is
<hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine</hi> and <hi>Noble;</hi> such as becomes his <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick</hi>
spirit; and yet alwaies accompany'd with a wonderfull <hi>Humility</hi> and
<hi>Courtesy.</hi> His <hi>Body</hi> is only made <hi>straight,</hi> and the
more <hi>it selfe,</hi> not (as most men's are) <hi>New-moulded</hi> by
<hi>Art:</hi> He has just so <hi>much</hi> of the <hi>Dancing-School</hi> as
will teach him how to <hi>laugh</hi> at those that have <hi>too</hi> much. He
has made more use of the <hi>Vaulter</hi> and <hi>Fencer,</hi> then the
<hi>Dancer;</hi> for his desire was more to be a <hi>Man,</hi> then a
<hi>Puppit,</hi> and to be a <hi>servant</hi> to his <hi>Country</hi> rather
then his <hi>Lady.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If in things of <hi>this</hi> Nature he sometimes studies
<hi>another's</hi> satisfaction more then his <hi>own,</hi> he will show how
much he can be <hi>more</hi> then a man, not how much <hi>lesse,</hi> and how
<hi>Active</hi> he can be, not how <hi>Apish.</hi> He so behaves himselfe, that
by what he <hi>does,</hi> you may rather Conclude he <hi>can</hi> do
<hi>more</hi> if he <hi>will,</hi> then that he <hi>hath</hi> done <hi>all</hi>
he <hi>can</hi> do. In these, as in all things else of the like
<hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency,</hi> he manifests his <hi>greatest</hi> power <hi>there
where</hi> most men have the <hi>least,</hi> in <hi>refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> 
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:42817:71"/> to doe, what he is sure would gain him the empty
<hi>Applause</hi> of the <hi>Multitude:</hi> Though, so farre as he can judge
the <hi>sport</hi> or <hi>Recreation Innocent</hi> and <hi>lawfull,</hi> he had
rather manifest a <hi>slighting</hi> and a <hi>disreguard,</hi> then an
<hi>hatred</hi> towards them.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Complements</hi> are not (as in others) the wild
<hi>extravagances</hi> of a <hi>Luxuriant Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi> but the
<hi>naturall</hi> breathings of a sincere <hi>kindnesse</hi> and
<hi>Respect;</hi> His <hi>Civility</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies one, with his
<hi>Duety,</hi> his <hi>Frindship,</hi> or his <hi>Charity.</hi> A
<hi>Court-dresse</hi> cannot bring him in love with a <hi>Lie;</hi> nor can he
look upon a <hi>Fashionable Hypocrisy</hi> with a more favourable eye, then
upon a <hi>Glorious cheat;</hi> He judges of all <hi>Dissimulation,</hi> as in
it selfe it is, for though in <hi>Complement</hi> the <hi>Practice</hi> of it
may seem <hi>Princely,</hi> yet in its own <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> he knowes 'tis
<hi>Devillish,</hi> and in the <hi>Issue</hi> will prove <hi>Damnable.</hi> He
Scornes to be Sathan's <hi>Schollar,</hi> though for so <hi>profitable</hi> a
lesson: for it was <hi>He</hi> indeed was the first <hi>Master</hi> of this
<hi>Ceremony;</hi> when he <hi>Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented</hi> our first <hi>Parents</hi>
out of their <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence</hi> and <hi>Paradice</hi> at once; tickling their

               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:42817:72"/> It is his care, that all the

<hi>Courtesy</hi> and <hi>Civility</hi> of his <hi>equals</hi> may be thought
nothing else but the <hi>reflection</hi> of <hi>his</hi> towards them. But if
ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers kindnesse chance to get the <hi>start</hi> in showing it selfe, he

               </p>
               <p>His <hi>Inferiors</hi> may behold in him how well

an <hi>Affability, Authority</hi> will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of: By his <hi>Practice</hi> our

<hi>inspire</hi> his Company with something <hi>like</hi> himselfe; and all his
<hi>Actions</hi> so many ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest <hi>Essayes</hi> towards the
<hi>assimilating</hi> of <hi>their</hi> Natures unto his <hi>own.</hi> He is
Master of so <hi>inexhaustible</hi> and <hi>Miraculous</hi> a treasury of
<hi>Goodnesse,</hi> that he may very well afford <hi>every</hi> man a
<hi>little</hi> and yet keep <hi>all</hi> unto <hi>himselfe.</hi> 
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:42817:78"/> He knowes not how to <hi>be</hi> good; and not to
<hi>doe</hi> good, and therefore one halfe of his study is to <hi>give
himselfe</hi> away. Neither his <hi>brest</hi> nor his <hi>purse</hi> are ever
<hi>shut</hi> to such as <hi>need</hi> him, and (God knowes) more <hi>need</hi>
him, then will make <hi>use</hi> of him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Gentleman</hi> may well be Compared unto a Great
<hi>Book,</hi> which alwaies lies wide <hi>open</hi> to the world; that
whosoever wants <hi>advice</hi> or <hi>Counsell,</hi> may freely
<hi>Consult</hi> him at pleasure: there they may <hi>read,</hi> what him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
as opportunity served him, has taken great pains to <hi>Coppy</hi> out
<hi>faire</hi> in all his <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> whatever is both <hi>safe,
great,</hi> and <hi>Good;</hi> thus in <hi>one</hi> and at <hi>once</hi> they
may behold both the <hi>rules</hi> of a <hi>Good life, Praecept</hi> and
<hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor doth this <hi>virtue</hi> more manifest it selfe in a liberall
<hi>distribution</hi> and <hi>Instruction,</hi> then in as <hi>free</hi> and
<hi>Impartiall</hi> a <hi>Correction</hi> and <hi>reproofe,</hi> whensoever it
is requisite, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing much rather to <hi>crosse</hi> the <hi>humour</hi> of
his <hi>friend,</hi> then flatter his <hi>vice;</hi> and to lose his
<hi>friendship</hi> here, then his <hi>Company</hi> (if it may be possible for
him to have it) in Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother day. He is not <hi>afraid</hi> to call every
Man by his <hi>own</hi> name, or adde the <hi>Epithete</hi> 
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:42817:79"/> which is due unto it; that so every one that comes into
his presence, may be <hi>afraid</hi> to bring a <hi>bad name</hi> along with
him. He can <hi>envy</hi> no man because he cannot see any one <hi>better</hi>
then himselfe; neither yet can he <hi>despise</hi> any man, because he really
<hi>desires</hi> every one might be as <hi>good</hi> as himselfe.</p>
               <p>So that, what's most of all Commendable, this most excellent
<hi>vertue</hi> is accompanied with a most exemplary <hi>humility;</hi> and
there is nothing can more deservedly <hi>exalt</hi> him in the thoughts of
<hi>all</hi> men, then this, that he is such a <hi>Diminutive</hi> in his
<hi>own.</hi> Nor does this proceed from an <hi>Ignorance</hi> of his own
<hi>excellencies,</hi> but rather hence, that he <hi>knowes</hi> whence he
<hi>had</hi> them: Neither does he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>praeferre</hi> every man in
<hi>Honour</hi> before himselfe, because he knowes not what <hi>other</hi> men
<hi>are,</hi> but because he knowes not what they <hi>may</hi> be. He is really
so <hi>high</hi> that he may with ease <hi>reach</hi> Heaven, but he
<hi>makes</hi> himselfe so <hi>low</hi> that he may go in at the <hi>strait
gate.</hi> When he looks upon his own <hi>vertues</hi> (which he had rather
<hi>show</hi> then <hi>see,</hi> and <hi>have</hi> then <hi>show)</hi> he will
not think them <hi>great,</hi> because he intends to make them yet much
<hi>Greater;</hi> neither can he tell how to <pb n="139" facs="tcp:42817:79"/>
                  <hi>applaud</hi> himselfe when he <hi>sees</hi> them <hi>great,</hi> because he
knowes well how little <hi>he</hi> either <hi>made</hi> or <hi>deserved</hi>
them. It is this <hi>vertue</hi> that makes him much more desire the
<hi>friendship</hi> of a <hi>vertuous Beggar,</hi> then the <hi>favour</hi> of
a <hi>vicious</hi> and <hi>licentious Prince;</hi> because <hi>this</hi> he
must assuredly <hi>lose,</hi> seeing he knowes not how in a <hi>Compliance</hi>
to his humour to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>wicked;</hi> but <hi>that</hi> shall never
<hi>end,</hi> but <hi>last</hi> as long as his <hi>Heaven.</hi> He chuses his
<hi>Companions</hi> not by the <hi>outward</hi> habit of their Body, but that
<hi>internall</hi> of the Soul; and sets an higher <hi>value</hi> on them for
their <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> then their <hi>Births.</hi> He is so little
<hi>proud</hi> of what he <hi>is,</hi> that he is indeed very <hi>humble</hi>
for what he is <hi>not.</hi> He will never be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded (as most of those we

that true <hi>Briaraeus,</hi> which has as many <hi>hands,</hi> as he meets
with <hi>receivers:</hi> and for this cause he is look'd upon as a
<hi>Monster</hi> in these later dayes, and very <hi>rarely</hi> to be met
with.</p>
               <p>The course he takes to <hi>ayre</hi> his <hi>Bags,</hi> and keep
them from <hi>moulding,</hi> is to <hi>distribute</hi> freely to <hi>all</hi>
that are in <hi>need.</hi> If he take some pains to become <hi>richer</hi> then
others, it is onely to put a <hi>cheat</hi> upon that which men miscall
<hi>Fortune,</hi> and to manifest he hath a <hi>power</hi> as great as her's;
that is, to make himselfe <hi>poor</hi> again at his pleasure; and to show that
<hi>Charity</hi> can entertain as <hi>rich</hi> servants as <hi>she.</hi>
Though God hath indulged him the <hi>priviledge</hi> and <hi>inheritance</hi>
of an <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der brother</hi> in the world, yet he wisely Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders that the
<hi>youngest</hi> of all may in equity challenge a <hi>Child's portion.</hi> He
esteemes it a very high <hi>Honour,</hi> that God has vouchsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed to make him
<hi>one</hi> of the <hi>Stewards</hi> in <hi>His</hi> great <hi>Family:</hi>
and he is nothing <hi>ambitious</hi> of <hi>his Epithete</hi> to his

<hi>Gospell</hi> for his <hi>Injustice.</hi>
               </p>

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:42817:80"/> the <hi>Lord,</hi> the <hi>Honour</hi> of being the

doubtlesse this <hi>Happinesse</hi> is not <hi>every</hi> man's, to have
<hi>God</hi> his <hi>Debtor.</hi> He accounts it much the <hi>safer</hi> way,
to trust his <hi>Charity</hi> then his <hi>Luxury</hi> with the <hi>Bag;</hi>
the former will bring in an <hi>even reckoning</hi> in <hi>Heaven;</hi> the

his <hi>Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and his <hi>Charitie,</hi> to permit his <hi>lusts</hi> to
use him yet <hi>worse,</hi> and leave him <hi>nothing</hi> at all. He scornes
<hi>first</hi> to <hi>swaggar</hi> and <hi>swill</hi> away his estate, and
<hi>then Curse</hi> his <hi>fortune</hi> for useing him so roughly; first to
<hi>make</hi> himselfe a <hi>Beggar,</hi> and then <hi>cry out</hi> upon his

<hi>he</hi> has, and <hi>pitties</hi> all he <hi>sees</hi> in <hi>want.</hi> He
looks upon his <hi>estate</hi> as that which was given him for <hi>use</hi> and

that whereby he has <hi>rob'd himselfe</hi> of a <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> and

               <p>Having spoken allready of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's <hi>Magnanimity,</hi> I
shall need to adde very little of his <hi>Valour;</hi> which he exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses more
in <hi>Obeying</hi> his <hi>God,</hi> then <hi>Opposing</hi> his
<hi>Brethren.</hi> His highest piece of <hi>Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> is that whereby he
<hi>Conquers himselfe</hi> and his <hi>sin;</hi> and in this he is alway
<hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</hi> He knowes that by thus becoming his <hi>own Captive,</hi>
he shall not want the <hi>usage</hi> of a <hi>Gentleman;</hi> and thus being
made his own <hi>Lord</hi> too, he is sure to be <hi>free</hi> from all the
<hi>world</hi> besides. He looks upon it as the basest degree of
<hi>Cowardice,</hi> to yield unto those <hi>feeble Passions,</hi> which, did
not both <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> step into their
<hi>Succour,</hi> would certainly become the <hi>prey</hi> of every
<hi>light</hi> and <hi>Empty</hi> toy. His Christian <hi>Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> is
such, that he fears not to <hi>Encounter</hi> the Great <hi>Goliah</hi> of
<hi>Hell,</hi> or an whole <hi>Army</hi> of such <hi>Philistins</hi> as have
set themselves in array against his <hi>Happinesse,</hi> all at once: not
though they be such, as by their <hi>Cunning</hi> have allready got
<hi>within</hi> him: He never gives over <hi>Resisting the Divell</hi> till he
have <pb n="145" facs="tcp:42817:82"/> put him to <hi>flight.</hi> He hath that
<hi>greatest Courage</hi> which is so rarely found in others, who would be
call'd <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> he <hi>dares</hi> be <hi>Religious</hi> in spite of
the <hi>World.</hi> He sets himselfe, without betraying the least
<hi>timi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,</hi> against that great <hi>Bugbeare,</hi> which so
<hi>scares</hi> most men not onely out of their <hi>wits</hi> but out of all
<hi>good actions, Shame,</hi> or <hi>Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi> These are they which, as
the <hi>Elephants</hi> in King <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> his Army terrified the
<hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> with their prodigious <hi>Bulk,</hi> do so <hi>affright</hi>
the greatest part of our <hi>Gentry,</hi> that they never leave <hi>flying</hi>
till they <hi>tumble</hi> into the <hi>Bottomlesse Pit</hi> together. The
<hi>True</hi> Gentleman, like the stout <hi>Minucius,</hi> has by experience
proved these <hi>Monsters</hi> to be of more <hi>Bulke</hi> then
<hi>Mettall,</hi> and to want <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> but an <hi>Adversary,</hi> to
bring them into <hi>Subjection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>true</hi> Gentleman has so much <hi>true va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,</hi> as
not to <hi>fear</hi> the <hi>brand</hi> of a <hi>Coward,</hi> where his
<hi>Courage</hi> would be his <hi>sin,</hi> and his <hi>Conquest</hi> his
<hi>ruine.</hi> He is ever the <hi>fugitive</hi> in such a <hi>chase,</hi> and
dare <hi>boast</hi> of nothing but being <hi>routed.</hi> 'Tis then alone he
<hi>feares</hi> not <hi>Death,</hi> when he is sure there is no <hi>Hell</hi>
will <hi>follow</hi> it. His <hi>life</hi> is more <hi>dear</hi> to him, then 
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:42817:83"/> that he should be Content to part with it for any thing
<hi>lesse</hi> then <hi>Heaven.</hi> He has an <hi>Honour,</hi> and that's his
<hi>Religion,</hi> a <hi>Mistresse</hi> too to vindicate and defend from all
inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and affronts, and that's his own <hi>Soul:</hi> For the sakes of
<hi>these two</hi> he is engaged in many a <hi>Duell,</hi> with those
<hi>Heresies</hi> and those <hi>Sins,</hi> which would <hi>stain</hi> and

the <hi>other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He thinks that <hi>Honour</hi> too <hi>dear</hi> which must be
<hi>bought</hi> with a <hi>Murther;</hi> and a <hi>Name</hi> which is never to
be <hi>worne,</hi> but by his <hi>Monument,</hi> none of the <hi>cheapest,</hi>
when <hi>purchased</hi> with his <hi>life.</hi> He has much <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nester</hi>
thoughts of his <hi>Mistresse,</hi> then to think her such a

               <p>There is indeed a <hi>Beauty,</hi> for which the

as is often <hi>black,</hi> though alwaies <hi>lovely:</hi> I mean, his own
<hi>Mother</hi> and his Saviour's <hi>spouse;</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of God:
and there is an <hi>Honour</hi> which he holds <hi>cheap</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough when
bought with the high <hi>price</hi> both of <hi>Life</hi> and
<hi>Livelihood,</hi> though (if he might have his choise) he had rather
<hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve <pb n="147" facs="tcp:42817:83"/> both</hi> to <hi>maintain</hi> it, then
<hi>lose either</hi> to <hi>purchase</hi> it, <hi>Loyalty</hi> to his
<hi>Prince,</hi> and <hi>Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> to his <hi>Country:</hi> For these he
does not fear to <hi>Embrace</hi> a <hi>Stake,</hi> to make the
<hi>Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold</hi> his <hi>Bed,</hi> and a <hi>Block</hi> his <hi>Pillow;</hi>
seeing he is assured, that whosoever thus <hi>lies down</hi> to <hi>rest</hi>
at <hi>night,</hi> shall without faile <hi>rise</hi> again to <hi>Glory</hi> in
the <hi>Morning.</hi> He holds it much more desireable to <hi>live</hi> a
<hi>Beggar,</hi> then to <hi>die</hi> a <hi>Traytor:</hi> And that his
<hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> and <hi>Conscience</hi> should expose him to <hi>Tyranny</hi>
and <hi>Violence,</hi> then his <hi>Treachery</hi> or <hi>Hipocrisy</hi> buy
out his <hi>temporall security.</hi> He thinks it no great matter to
<hi>trust</hi> that <hi>God</hi> with his <hi>Person</hi> and his

that Glories <hi>lest</hi> in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of it. He looks upon his present

dismounts him, and his unexpected fall <hi>awakes</hi> him from his pleasant

               <p>To speak the whole, the <hi>true Gentleman</hi> hath so slight an

               <p>

think fit to receive into his <hi>Garner.</hi> He is ashamed to think that God
should lose his paines, and the more he <hi>thrashes,</hi> find onely more

not to refuse the exercise of that <hi>Office</hi> which belongs unto him.
Hence he thinks it an <hi>unworthinesse</hi> in him, not only, to do
<hi>ill,</hi> but to doe <hi>no Good;</hi> and these <hi>two</hi> he can very
hardly <hi>distinguish,</hi> as some would fain doe, seeing undoubtedly that
which doth <hi>no good,</hi> is <hi>good for nothing,</hi> and this is to be
<hi>starke naught.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>—He holds it to be (as indeed it is) a crying shame, whilest
the <hi>Taylor,</hi> and the <hi>Cobler</hi> are justly reckon'd among the
<hi>Necessary</hi> members of a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> that the
<hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,</hi> who takes it as an affront not to be thought much
<hi>better</hi> then such <hi>Mechanicks,</hi> should not be so much as
<hi>usefull</hi> to the place where he lives: or at most, but as the
<hi>trimming</hi> is to a good <hi>suit,</hi> or the <hi>haire</hi> to the
<hi>head,</hi> which may be <hi>Cut off</hi> and thrown away, and no great hurt
done to either. This indeed is the <hi>Gentleman's</hi> priviledg, 
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:42817:90"/> not to be a servant to any <hi>one</hi> particular
Member, but to the <hi>whole</hi> body; and that whilest others in their
Inferiour Condition, are onely made capable of serving a <hi>few,</hi> his
fortune is such as will allow him to be truly serviceable unto <hi>all.</hi>
Herein consists his <hi>Honour,</hi> that he is not put to work as a
<hi>drudg</hi> or <hi>journy-man;</hi> but is a <hi>Freeman</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and
<hi>Master</hi> of his trade; and whilest others <hi>toyle</hi> hard, and
receive a <hi>scant</hi> pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance when their worke's done; He is able to worke
<hi>gratis,</hi> and so <hi>oblige</hi> a great part of the world by his
<hi>service.</hi> Indeed this must needs be the greatest obligation can be laid
upon the <hi>Gentleman,</hi> to labour <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and doe <hi>better</hi>
then other men, because he is beforehand not onely furnished with good
<hi>tooles,</hi> by an <hi>Ingennous education,</hi> to worke withall; but hath
(as was said) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived so great a part of his <hi>reward</hi> already, and yet
is assured of an infinitely greater yet behind. How is he ashamed to
<hi>deceive</hi> him by his <hi>Idlenesse,</hi> who of his great
<hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> hath so farre already <hi>trusted</hi> to his
<hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As he <hi>refuseth</hi> no Employment, which may render him
according to the measure <pb n="162" facs="tcp:42817:91"/> of his Abilities
<hi>serviceable</hi> to his <hi>Countrey;</hi> so is he no way
<hi>ambitious</hi> of that which he knowes to be <hi>above</hi> his
<hi>strength</hi> and <hi>reach.</hi> As his great <hi>love</hi> to his
<hi>Country</hi> perswades him not to <hi>refuse</hi> the <hi>higher,</hi> so
doth his <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi> Command him to <hi>accept</hi> the <hi>lower:</hi>
he accounts no burthen <hi>heavy</hi> which he is <hi>able</hi> to beare; nor
any <hi>light</hi> which is either <hi>beyond,</hi> or not <hi>worth</hi> his
bearing. He makes not his <hi>Ease</hi> an <hi>excuse,</hi> nor the
<hi>Difficulty</hi> an <hi>apology</hi> for his refusall. He dischargeth his
trust with that <hi>fidelity,</hi> which will be sure to gain him, though
perhaps the <hi>hatred</hi> of the <hi>Bad,</hi> yet the <hi>applause</hi> and
<hi>love</hi> of the <hi>Good,</hi> and the unanimous <hi>thanks</hi> of his

               <p>That he may in good time be fitted for the <hi>Calling</hi> he
intends, he begins to think upon it early in the <hi>Morning</hi> of his age;
and accustomes himselfe to the <hi>yoak</hi> whilest he is <hi>young,</hi> that
so he may bear it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>galling</hi> his neck when he growes
<hi>old.</hi> He makes it <hi>now</hi> his businesse to gather the
<hi>thyme,</hi> which he intends shall prove <hi>Hony <pb n="163" facs="tcp:42817:91"/>
hereafter;</hi> and to lay up in the <hi>Spring</hi> what may stand him in
stead when his <hi>winter</hi> is come. That he may indeed be <hi>young</hi> in
<hi>Old-age,</hi> he learnes to be <hi>Old</hi> in his <hi>youth;</hi> and he
sucks so much out of every <hi>science</hi> now, as <hi>Experience</hi> and
<hi>years</hi> may by degrees hereafter improve into that <hi>Prudence</hi>
which becomes a <hi>Gentleman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having in his greener yeares onely so much <hi>discretion,</hi> as
to <hi>find</hi> the <hi>want</hi> of what he should <hi>have,</hi> he is
willingly directed by the <hi>prudence</hi> of another, 'till he can get
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for himselfe. He is not <hi>Impatient</hi> of <hi>Subjection</hi> now
to that wise and grave <hi>Instructor,</hi> from whose both <hi>dictates</hi>
and <hi>example</hi> he hopes to gain so much as may make him the
<hi>Instructor</hi> of others hereafter: And he learnes so betimes to
<hi>obey,</hi> that the world may never have reason to say he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to
<hi>Command</hi> too <hi>soon.</hi> It is his choice to live under a
<hi>severe</hi> discipline, rather then to be left to himselfe as his
<hi>own</hi> Master; lest perhaps failing in his <hi>first</hi> Command,
whereby he should have Govern'd <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,</hi> he might despaire of better
successe in his <hi>second</hi> of Commanding <hi>others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His first care therefore now is to be wholy <pb n="164" facs="tcp:42817:92"/>
guided by him to whose <hi>prudence</hi> he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted; lest by rejecting
<hi>him,</hi> he might seem to disparage the <hi>judgment</hi> of his
<hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi> who made that <hi>choise</hi> for him. Where the
<hi>Commands</hi> laid upon him <hi>seem</hi> to him <hi>irrationall,</hi> so
long as he knowes them not <hi>sinfull,</hi> he had rather <hi>distrust</hi>
his own <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> then neglect his director's <hi>counsell:</hi> and
he never thinks himselfe (as very many doe) a <hi>better man</hi> then his
<hi>guide,</hi> 'till he be sure he <hi>knowes the way</hi> to that he aimes
at, <hi>better</hi> then he. He never showes himselfe more to be his
<hi>own</hi> man, and at his own disposall, then by this <hi>unconstrained</hi>
act of <hi>resigning</hi> himselfe up unto <hi>another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When he is come to that maturity of <hi>Age</hi> and
<hi>Discretion,</hi> as to be able to benefit himselfe by his <hi>Company,</hi>
he will be sure to make choise of such <hi>Companions</hi> as may serve him
instead of <hi>Books;</hi> and of such <hi>Books</hi> as he intends shall often
serve him for <hi>Companions:</hi> He is not ashamed to be now the
<hi>worst</hi> man in that <hi>Company,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he may <hi>learne</hi>
from his betters, how to be the <hi>best</hi> in <hi>another:</hi> this is much
more <hi>honourable,</hi> then to be the <hi>best</hi> man <hi>there,
where</hi> he can never learne to be <hi>better,</hi> but <pb n="165" facs="tcp:42817:92"/>
often <hi>worse</hi> then he was before.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Studies</hi> whereunto he cheerfully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies himselfe,
are such as will more <hi>make</hi> the <hi>man,</hi> then <hi>please</hi> the
<hi>Boy.</hi> He takes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in nothing which will send him <hi>back</hi>
again towards his <hi>Infancy,</hi> but <hi>Innocence.</hi> As for
<hi>Poëtry</hi> and such like <hi>pleasing</hi> studies, he does not wholy
<hi>neglect</hi> them, but uses them as good <hi>sauces</hi> to make others
more <hi>substantiall</hi> and <hi>nourishing rellish</hi> the <hi>better.</hi>
He loves not to spend his time in cracking <hi>Empty</hi> Nuts without a
<hi>Kernell;</hi> nor to break his <hi>tender</hi> teeth by <hi>gnawing</hi>
upon <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> bones. Neither Nice <hi>Criticismes</hi> nor tough
<hi>Notions,</hi> can recompense him for the vast expence of that precious
time, he should be at in making himselfe the Master of <hi>either.</hi> When he
is entred into the faire <hi>garden</hi> of the <hi>Muses</hi> it is not his

it with <hi>Blossomes</hi> and <hi>flourishes</hi> out of some <hi>Poetick</hi>
figment, or <hi>Romantick</hi> story; but he <hi>gathers, eats</hi> and
<hi>digests,</hi> that which is <hi>fruit</hi> indeed, and such as is truly
<hi>wholsome</hi> and <hi>nourishing:</hi> Nor doth he, as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's
Army, lie loytering, and picking <pb n="166" facs="tcp:42817:93"/> up <hi>Cockle-shels</hi>
upon the <hi>shores</hi> of good lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature, but he boldly launches out into
the main <hi>Ocean,</hi> and there Contemplates the wonders of the
<hi>deep.</hi> It is not his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe to be call'd a <hi>Witty Gentleman,</hi>
and such an one as can talk <hi>high,</hi> and breath <hi>flashes,</hi> and
<hi>thunder</hi> out <hi>big</hi> words, and store himselfe with so many
<hi>jests,</hi> and so much <hi>Bombast,</hi> as may <hi>tickle</hi> some, and
<hi>stupifie</hi> others; he studies more to make himselfe a <hi>man</hi> then
a <hi>Companion;</hi> and more how to <hi>live</hi> and <hi>do well,</hi> then
talke <hi>finely. True Histories,</hi> and <hi>Sound Politicks,</hi> and
<hi>grave Morall</hi> discourses, are the <hi>fruitfull</hi> Gardens where his
<hi>Muses</hi> doe ordinarily <hi>recreate</hi> themselves: that so by his
<hi>Pleasures</hi> as well as <hi>Pains,</hi> both the <hi>Commonwealth</hi>
may in due time be happy in <hi>him,</hi> and <hi>he</hi> in <hi>himselfe.</hi>
As for those <hi>lighter</hi> and more <hi>ayery</hi> studies, such as too
frequently by their lovely <hi>paint</hi> and <hi>dissembled</hi> beauty,
<hi>steal</hi> away the <hi>amorous</hi> and <hi>unfixed</hi> youth of most

take a <hi>turne</hi> or two for <hi>Recreation's</hi> sake, and as he passes

<hi>greatly desire</hi> it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Divinity</hi> can never lie out of the <hi>true</hi>
Gentleman's <hi>way,</hi> because he is alwaies go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards <hi>Heaven:</hi>
For notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding she seems so <hi>pale-faced,</hi> and of so <hi>soure</hi>
a Countenance to those that <hi>love</hi> her <hi>not,</hi> because they do not
<hi>know</hi> her; yet is there so much <hi>heavenly beauty,</hi> and so many
<hi>noble features</hi> discernable in her face, by the Gentleman's
<hi>undistemper'd</hi> eye, that he soon begins in earnest to <hi>love</hi>
her, and he can never go on farre in any other path what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, but he must
often cast a <hi>longing eye</hi> back upon her. Still bearing in mind the 
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42817:94"/> 
                  <hi>happy place</hi> whither he is travaling with so good
a will, he <hi>calls in</hi> at other <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences</hi> as at
so many <hi>Innes,</hi> to take a short <hi>repast</hi> by the way: or he
stands <hi>looking</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them a while as upon so many <hi>way markes</hi>
set up at the severall <hi>turnings</hi> and <hi>Crosse paths,</hi> that from
them he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>directions</hi> which way to turne: But the
<hi>knowledg</hi> of his <hi>God,</hi> that's the way he constantly
<hi>walkes</hi> in, and that which will certainly bring him at last to that
<hi>home,</hi> where he shall meet with a <hi>Welcome,</hi> which will
abundantly recompence the <hi>tediousnesse</hi> of his <hi>journy;</hi> and an
<hi>entertainment</hi> suitable to the <hi>Quality</hi> of a
<hi>Gentleman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His way being <hi>long,</hi> it is not amisse that he allowes
himselfe sometimes a <hi>recreation</hi> and <hi>diversion.</hi> But then his
<hi>recreation</hi> shall be alwaies such as he <hi>dares not</hi> make his
<hi>businesse,</hi> and yet such as he <hi>dares</hi> safely make his
<hi>play:</hi> It hath alwaies so much of <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence</hi> as to be
<hi>blamelesse,</hi> and so much <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi> as to be no

<hi>lovelinesse,</hi> as may spoile the <hi>temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> He may step
<hi>over</hi> the hedg into the pleasant <hi>Meadow,</hi> and pluck a sweet
<hi>flower</hi> or <hi>two</hi> to <hi>smell</hi> to as he goes along, but he
dares not <hi>lie</hi> him <hi>down,</hi> or <hi>rowle</hi> himselfe upon the
tender <hi>grasse,</hi> lest he should be tempted to too <hi>long</hi> a
<hi>stay,</hi> and thereby be <hi>benighted</hi> in his journey.</p>
               <p>He thinks it no <hi>prudence</hi> to fall in <hi>love</hi> with
any <hi>sport,</hi> which like a Cunning thiefe, <hi>smiles</hi> him in the
<hi>face,</hi> whilest it <hi>cuts</hi> his <hi>purse, steals</hi> away his

<hi>Agar</hi> once begin thus to insinuate her selfe into <hi>those</hi>
affections, <hi>which</hi> are <hi>only</hi> due to her <hi>Mistresse;</hi> out
of dores she shall goe: He intends not to <hi>sell</hi> his <hi>Charity</hi> at
so <hi>cheap</hi> a rate, as the <hi>false pleasure</hi> of his <hi>game;</hi>
Nor has he so little either <hi>thrift</hi> or <hi>Religion,</hi> as to make so
<hi>foolish</hi> an <hi>Exchange,</hi> and part either with his <hi>Soul</hi>
or his <hi>Time</hi> for the <hi>transitory</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of a
<hi>dangerous</hi> temptation. His usuall <hi>Recreation</hi> therefore is, to
make a <hi>play</hi> of his <hi>Study.</hi> He makes <hi>one</hi> study, like a
<hi>shooing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horne,</hi> to <hi>draw on</hi> another, and makes the
<hi>variety</hi> the <hi>recreation.</hi> Thus he takes the surest course that
may be, for making his <pb n="170" facs="tcp:42817:95"/> 
                  <hi>Study</hi> so much his

<hi>his</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to <hi>them.</hi> He looks upon no man as a
<hi>Gentleman,</hi> but <hi>him</hi> alone, who derives his <hi>pedigree</hi>
higher then from <hi>Adam,</hi> even from <hi>Heaven:</hi> and he accounts all
those who can brook any <hi>Dishonour</hi> or <hi>Contempt</hi> of their
<hi>God</hi> that one <hi>Common father</hi> of us all, as a <hi>Bastard</hi>
and no <hi>Son.</hi> It would be no <hi>Honour</hi> for him to seeke an
acquaintance here upon <hi>Earth,</hi> and therefore by his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<hi>Devotions</hi> he often goes to seek out a better in <hi>Heaven;</hi> where
he may be sure <pb n="173" facs="tcp:42817:96"/> to meet with such, as shall be worth his
<hi>kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.</hi> He dares call every man a <hi>Fool</hi> to his face who with
<hi>David's Fool,</hi> suffers ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his <hi>tongue</hi> or his
<hi>heart</hi> to say <hi>There is no God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you aske him, what <hi>Religion</hi> he is of, his answer is
ready, of his <hi>mother's;</hi> that is, he is a <hi>true Son</hi> of the
<hi>Church:</hi> And yet is he onely so farre <hi>her Son,</hi> as he sees her
wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to continue his <hi>Saviour's Spouse.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is he content to
be still an <hi>Infant</hi> in Religion, and to be taught onely (as
<hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> use to teach their <hi>young</hi> children) to say his
<hi>prayers</hi> and his <hi>Creed</hi> by <hi>rote,</hi> but he
<hi>prayes</hi> and <hi>believes</hi> and <hi>practises</hi> all truely <hi>by
heart:</hi> Notwithstanding, he never <hi>forgets</hi> his <hi>Mother,</hi> nor
neglects to <hi>Honour</hi> her with his <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Substance.</hi>
He is alwaies more ready to take her <hi>Directions</hi> for the <hi>Forme</hi>
and <hi>Method</hi> of all his <hi>duties,</hi> then to be
<hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplined</hi> by all those <hi>Chatting Dry-nurses</hi> which are so
busy about him, such as indeed have <hi>talk</hi> enough, but (alas) no
<hi>Milke;</hi> whose whole businesse is indeed to make him <hi>undutifull</hi>
to his <hi>own mother,</hi> and to set light by all her <hi>Councells</hi> and
<hi>Commands:</hi> perswading him to believe that a <hi>true Child 
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:42817:97"/> of God,</hi> not <hi>subject</hi> to a <hi>Mother</hi> in
any thing; And they never show their <hi>venemous</hi> teeth more plainly, then
when they goe about to make him forget what this <hi>Mother</hi> of all
<hi>Christians</hi> by a strict <hi>Command</hi> from her <hi>Dearest Lord</hi>
has ever been most <hi>carefull</hi> to <hi>teach</hi> all her children, to
say—OUR FATHER.</p>
               <p>He goes not to <hi>Church</hi> to <hi>save</hi> his
<hi>Credit</hi> or his <hi>Purse,</hi> to <hi>see</hi> his <hi>friend</hi> or
<hi>speak</hi> with his <hi>Tenent,</hi> but to <hi>meet</hi> his <hi>Heavenly
Father,</hi> and <hi>Commune</hi> with his <hi>God,</hi> and to take
<hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections</hi> from <hi>him</hi> how to <hi>behave</hi> himselfe the
following <hi>week</hi> or <hi>Day.</hi> When he is there, he makes his
<hi>heart</hi> accompany his <hi>tongue,</hi> and his <hi>Eare</hi> keep time
with the <hi>Preacher.</hi> Every <hi>Morning</hi> and <hi>Evening,</hi> like a
<hi>Dutifull</hi> sonne, he in private <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth</hi> his
<hi>faults,</hi> and <hi>begs</hi> his Father's <hi>pardon</hi> and
<hi>blessing;</hi> and for the better ordering of his <hi>following</hi>
duties, reads over with <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Humility</hi> some part of those
<hi>Directions,</hi> which he had long since Commanded his servants to set down
in <hi>writing</hi> for his use.</p>
               <p>He chuseth his <hi>Religion,</hi> not by it's
<hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monnesse</hi> but it's <hi>truth:</hi> and often <hi>weighs</hi> each 
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:42817:97"/> branch of it in the <hi>Balance</hi> of the
<hi>Sanctuary,</hi> that he may be sure it is <hi>full weight.</hi> He takes it
not up by <hi>votes,</hi> nor (as it is most evident too many do) thrusts his
hand at all <hi>peradventure</hi> into an Hat-full of <hi>Lots,</hi> being
content with whatever he <hi>hits</hi> on <hi>first;</hi> for should he goe the
<hi>first</hi> way to work, he knowes, he should be sure to have, not whats
<hi>Best</hi> and <hi>Soundest,</hi> but the <hi>Easiest,</hi> and most
<hi>Gainfull;</hi> if the <hi>later,</hi> it is an hundred to one that he shall
draw a <hi>blank,</hi> and be made an <hi>Atheist</hi> for his labour. Here he
dares not by any means follow or embrace what's most in <hi>Fashion,</hi> for
that ('tis clear) is <hi>Hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cricy</hi> the cunning <hi>Sister</hi> of
<hi>Atheisme,</hi> or <hi>Atheisme shamed</hi> or <hi>frighted</hi> into
<hi>conformity;</hi> but he professes that which is most <hi>Ancient,</hi> for
that (he may be sure) will at last be found most true.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Religion</hi> is not such a <hi>Young, Light</hi> and
<hi>Wanton</hi> Girle, as pleases the vain <hi>Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> of every giddy
<hi>Interested professor;</hi> but such a <hi>Grave Matron</hi> whose naturall
<hi>Beauty,</hi> and <hi>Constancy,</hi> the Gray-hairs of <hi>Prudence</hi>
and <hi>Sobriety,</hi> have ever judged to be truly <hi>Venerable,</hi> and
most deserving of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian's</hi> embraces. This is that worthy
<hi>Lady,</hi> 
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:42817:98"/> which he dayly <hi>Courts,</hi> to make
her the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse</hi> and <hi>Protectresse</hi> of his <hi>Soul,</hi> and
she it is alone that can give him a <hi>breeding</hi> fit for
<hi>Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He showes how <hi>freely</hi> he can goe on in the, wayes of
<hi>Godlinesse</hi> without a <hi>Spurre;</hi> and how <hi>base</hi> a thing it
is and unbecoming his <hi>Quality</hi> to be <hi>driven</hi> into Heaven by
<hi>force.</hi> By his <hi>hast</hi> and <hi>cheerfulnesse</hi> in his race, he
evidences his <hi>sense</hi> of the <hi>Worth</hi> of what he aimes at; And by
his <hi>egernesse</hi> in the pursuit of <hi>another</hi> world, endeavours to
confute the <hi>folly</hi> of those, who would lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger out an <hi>eternity</hi>
(were it possible) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Onyons</hi> and <hi>Fleshpots</hi> of
<hi>this Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi> As he was <hi>borne</hi> a <hi>man,</hi> so he had his
<hi>Inheritance</hi> upon <hi>Earth;</hi> but as he is <hi>New-borne</hi> a
<hi>Christian,</hi> he leaves this <hi>trash</hi> to the <hi>Prodigall younger
Brother,</hi> expecting a <hi>Possession durable in the Heavens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He feares as little the names of <hi>Precise</hi> and
<hi>zealous,</hi> wherewith the <hi>Divell</hi> in the Mouths of his
<hi>Disciples,</hi> thinks to <hi>fright</hi> him out of all
<hi>Holinesse;</hi> as <hi>they</hi> understand them, who thus too frequently
<hi>abuse</hi> them. That <hi>Boysterous</hi> breath which the
<hi>prophane</hi> world sends forth to <hi>deride</hi> and <hi>Crosse</hi> him
in his <pb n="177" facs="tcp:42817:98"/> intended voyage, he, like a <hi>skilfull</hi>
Pilote so orders by the right <hi>Composing</hi> of his <hi>Sayles,</hi> that
he makes <hi>that</hi> his greatest <hi>advantage</hi> and furtherance, which
was intended for his <hi>ruine.</hi> He can go to Heaven with any <hi>wind</hi>
and with any <hi>Name,</hi> where he is so sure to meet with a <hi>title</hi>
of <hi>Honour, a name written in the book of life,</hi> even the <hi>Honour of
all his Saints.</hi> He cannot Phancy that to be any <hi>debasement</hi> of his
spirit, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries him out upon so <hi>High</hi> and <hi>Noble</hi>
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements; but thinks it an Happinesse to goe into <hi>Canaan,</hi> though
it be through a <hi>Red sea,</hi> and a rude <hi>Wildernesse;</hi> whilest
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (alas) feed so greedily upon the <hi>Quailes,</hi> that they never
<hi>say grace,</hi> but in a <hi>murmuring,</hi> that they have not
<hi>more</hi> and <hi>better</hi> cheer; He feeds more upon his <hi>hopes,</hi>
then his <hi>enjoyments,</hi> and blesses his God for <hi>both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now this <hi>Religion,</hi> which he has thus wisely
<hi>espoused,</hi> and entirely <hi>loves,</hi> he dares not prostitute to
<hi>Interest</hi> or <hi>Humour:</hi> But as any man accounts the enjoyment of
<hi>one</hi> thing which he principally <hi>loves,</hi> enough to recompence
him for all that he has been constrain'd to part with in his pursuit after 
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42817:99"/> it: so the <hi>Religious Gentleman</hi> can freely part
with both <hi>Humour</hi> and <hi>Interest,</hi> with all he <hi>enjoyes,</hi>
and all he <hi>hopes</hi> for here, for his <hi>Religion's</hi> sake, being
sure to find them all again hereafter, in the fruition of <hi>Her,</hi> whom he
so sincerely loves. Like a <hi>Prudent</hi> lover, he removes all occasions of
<hi>Iealousy</hi> from his beloved; His <hi>Religion</hi> shall never have
cause to fear, that either his <hi>Pleasure</hi> or his <hi>Honour,</hi> or his
<hi>Profit,</hi> shall gaine so much upon his affections, as to become her
<hi>Rivall.</hi>

               <p>Thus (Sir) Whilest I goe about to give you the Character of a true
<hi>Gentleman,</hi> I am falne into that of a <hi>Christian;</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
no wonder, for there is such a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Connexion</hi> betwixt these two,
that they seeme to be no more then the <hi>Different Names</hi> of the <hi>same
man.</hi> If you desire to have his picture in a lesse Compasse here it is.</p>
               <p>The <hi>true Gentleman,</hi> is one that is <hi>God's servant, the
World's Master,</hi> and his <hi>own Man.</hi> 
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:42817:99"/> His
<hi>Vertue</hi> is his <hi>Businesse,</hi> his <hi>Study</hi> his
<hi>recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, Contentednesse</hi> his <hi>rest,</hi> and <hi>Happinesse</hi>
his <hi>reward. God</hi> is his <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> is his
<hi>Mother,</hi> the <hi>Saints</hi> his <hi>Brethren,</hi> all that
<hi>need</hi> him his <hi>Friends,</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi> his
<hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. Religion</hi> is his <hi>Mistresse, Loyalty</hi> and
<hi>Iustice</hi> her <hi>Ladies</hi> of <hi>Honour; Devotion</hi> is his
<hi>Chaplain, Chastity</hi> his <hi>Chamberlain, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety</hi> his
<hi>Buttler, Temperance</hi> his <hi>Cook, Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitallity</hi> his
<hi>Houskeeper, Providence</hi> his <hi>Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, Charity</hi> his
<hi>Treasurer: Piety</hi> is <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse</hi> of the <hi>House,</hi> and
<hi>Discretion</hi> the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> to let <hi>in</hi> and <hi>out</hi>
as is most fit. Thus is his whole <hi>Family</hi> made up of <hi>Vertues,</hi>
and he the true <hi>Master</hi> of his <hi>Family.</hi> He is necessitated to
take the world in his <hi>way</hi> to Heaven, but he walkes <hi>through</hi> it
as fast as he can; and all his businesse by the <hi>way,</hi> is to make
himselfe and others <hi>happy.</hi> Take him all in two words, he is a
<hi>Man</hi> and a <hi>Christian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here (Sir) 'tis time that I beg both the Gentleman's pardon
and Your's, for thus abusing his name; and presuming to give you his Character,
whose excellencies are not to be <hi>Comprehended,</hi> much lesse
<hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,</hi> by any one <hi>lesse</hi> then himselfe. I 
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:42817:100"/> have an <hi>Apology</hi> at hand, for giving you this
<hi>rude</hi> and <hi>Imperfect</hi> draught of his <hi>Picture:</hi> that I
give it you <hi>at all,</hi> it is my <hi>obedience</hi> to your Command; that
you receive it so <hi>Mishapen</hi> and <hi>ill proportion'd,</hi> besides the
little <hi>experience</hi> and lesse <hi>skill</hi> of the Painter, he has this
to say for himselfe; he could hardly tell where, being absent from such as
<hi>you</hi> Sir, to find a <hi>true</hi> Gentleman to draw it by: But either
he was Constrained to take it from the <hi>Dead,</hi> and then no wonder if his
work fall short both of <hi>Complexion</hi> and <hi>life;</hi> or by that faint
<hi>Idea</hi> he had in his own mind, and therefore he hopes he is excusable
though he sometimes mistake in the <hi>Feature.</hi> If you meet in any place
with too <hi>deep</hi> a <hi>shadow,</hi> where there should be more
<hi>light,</hi> he desires, that beside the <hi>weaknesse</hi> of his
<hi>eye,</hi> you would consider the <hi>Darknesse</hi> of the <hi>Time,</hi>
and the <hi>uncertain light</hi> he saw by. For we live so much in the
<hi>Evening</hi> of the world, when the thick and foggy <hi>mists</hi> of
<hi>Ignorance</hi> darken the ayre; and that fading light we have is so
<hi>variously</hi> refracted by our <hi>Glittering</hi> Vices; and so
<hi>often</hi> reflected by the <hi>Disfigured</hi> glasses of <hi>Phancy</hi>
and <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;</hi> that there is nothing troubles him so 
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:42817:100"/> much, as that he is unhappily furnished with so <hi>many
excuses</hi> to plead for his <hi>Errour.</hi> But if any will not be satisfied
with this, he yet layes claime to a further <hi>Priviledg</hi> of a
<hi>Painter,</hi> that is, to be a little more <hi>talkative,</hi> and to say
something more in vindication of what he has done; and thereby demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
that the excellent <hi>Originall</hi> he would have <hi>Coppy'd,</hi> is either
not at all, or very rarely to be met with, at <hi>this</hi> day, in

               <p>I Need not tell <hi>you</hi> (Sir) who have paid so dear for the
sad <hi>changes;</hi> that it is our hard hap to live in a <hi>reforming</hi>
Age, wherein most things grow every day <hi>new,</hi> but very few things
<hi>better.</hi> And I do hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wish it were as seriously

<hi>most, rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi> at by <hi>some,</hi> and sadly <hi>lamented</hi> by
<hi>others,</hi> what a <hi>decrease</hi> and <hi>waning</hi> there has been in
the <hi>Gentry</hi> of <hi>England</hi> within a few of the last yeares; and
that not only in the <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> of their <hi>Persons,</hi> and
<hi>largenesse</hi> of their <hi>Estates;</hi> but even in the
<hi>Excellencies</hi> of their <hi>Soules,</hi> and the <hi>greatnesse</hi> of
their <hi>Vertues.</hi> As if it had been a <hi>small</hi> thing for them to
live so long the <hi>Despised vassels</hi> of their <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall
Adversaries,</hi> the good <hi>Masters</hi> that have so long <hi>ruled</hi>
us; except they <pb n="183" facs="tcp:42817:101"/> had been permitted, by the severest kind
of <hi>Cruelty</hi> to take <hi>vengeance</hi> of their own <hi>vertues,</hi>
and render themselves ten times more the wretched <hi>Captives,</hi> and
despica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>slaves,</hi> of their own Tyrannicall <hi>Lusts,</hi> and
Atheisticall <hi>Humours</hi> then before. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed an <hi>Atheist</hi> and a
<hi>Gentleman</hi> in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of many, have for a long time been ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Synonymous</hi> or at<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> least <hi>Convertible</hi> termes: I dare not,
I confesse, have such hard thoughts of <hi>all,</hi> though I could heartily
wish, they would rather take some pains by their <hi>lives</hi> and
<hi>Conversations</hi> to prove this to be an <hi>absurd,</hi> then
<hi>stretch</hi> their <hi>lungs</hi> to cry out upon it, and <hi>swear</hi> it
to be a <hi>rash</hi> and <hi>uncharitable</hi> Censure.</p>
               <p>Indeed, if on the <hi>oneside,</hi> in a feigned <hi>show</hi> of
Religion to exclaim against <hi>Drunkennesse</hi> and <hi>Swearing,</hi> and
other such like <hi>lowd</hi> and <hi>Open</hi> Prophanenesses, will suffice to
Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the <hi>Saint:</hi> Or if on the <hi>other side</hi> to Cry out
upon <hi>Hipocricy</hi> and <hi>Injustice, Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Sacriledg,
Lying</hi> and <hi>Perjury,</hi> may be thought sufficient to constitute a true
<hi>Son</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> then have we
<hi>all</hi> enough to say for our selves, and to prove that most of our
<hi>Gentlemen</hi> 
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:42817:102"/> are indeed <hi>Christians.</hi> But,
alas, it is too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that on the <hi>one</hi> hand, all this
<hi>Canting</hi> and <hi>superficiall sanctity;</hi> all these <hi>strained
sighs</hi> and <hi>Greanes,</hi> and <hi>turn'd-up Eyes,</hi> are no better
then Sathan's <hi>Sunday's Garbe,</hi> or the painted <hi>Maskes</hi> and
<hi>vizards,</hi> which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice, Ambition</hi> and <hi>Interest</hi> love
to be <hi>seen</hi> in abroad. These are the <hi>Enriching Crafts,</hi> whereby
our <hi>Demetriuses get their wealth.</hi> Many who have passed for
<hi>Saints</hi> along time <hi>(experience</hi> has shown it us) have been just
such as <hi>he,</hi> who had rather make <hi>Silver shrines</hi> for
<hi>Diana,</hi> so they may be sure to be well <hi>paid</hi> for their work,
then build <hi>Temples</hi> for the <hi>Worship</hi> of a <hi>Crucified
Iesus</hi> in hopes of an Heaven, and meet with his <hi>Crosse</hi> for their
pains. And on the <hi>other</hi> hand all those <hi>raveings</hi> which we
dayly hear against <hi>Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, Hipocricy</hi> and <hi>Tyranny,</hi> I am
afraid, they are not so often the <hi>seasonable</hi> overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a
<hi>Devout</hi> Spirit, a <hi>sincere</hi> soul, and a <hi>Loyall</hi> heart;
as the wild <hi>outrages</hi> of a <hi>boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> Passion, of a
<hi>Confined,</hi> vice, and a <hi>restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> lust, which makes the
sufferer like a <hi>Mad man</hi> to <hi>gnaw</hi> upon his <hi>chains</hi> and
<hi>fetters:</hi> or else they are the <hi>violent</hi> motions of a
<hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengfull</hi> Soul, which <hi>frets</hi> it selfe at the
<hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity</hi> 
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:42817:102"/> of the <hi>wicked,</hi> and had
rather see it's <hi>enemies miserable,</hi> then <hi>it selfe sober</hi> and
<hi>good.</hi> This is in truth that which many have thought enough to give
<hi>either</hi> party the title of <hi>religious:</hi> but how they make good
their claim to this title in their <hi>Actions,</hi> it is but too visible.</p>
               <p>Certainly if the <hi>Gentleman's life</hi> and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<hi>Conversation</hi> may be thought (as it ought to be) the best
<hi>index</hi> to point us out to his <hi>opinion;</hi> we shall have much a
doe to meet in most of those that own that name, with a <hi>Good Opinion</hi>
either of <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Most of them (I am sure the
<hi>younger</hi> sort) do grudg either of these the least place in their
<hi>discourse,</hi> and therefore, it is to be fear'd as little in their
<hi>thoughts.</hi> They would as soon, nay much sooner make choise of a
<hi>Tinker</hi> or a <hi>Fidler,</hi> then of a <hi>Religious</hi> man for
their <hi>Companion.</hi> Alas, such an one would spoyl all their
<hi>Mirth,</hi> and make their very <hi>lives,</hi> by plunging them into a
<hi>Malancholy Mood,</hi> meer <hi>torments</hi> to them. Any thing that's
<hi>grave</hi> and <hi>serious</hi> they perfectly <hi>loath</hi> and utterly
<hi>reject,</hi> as that which cannot at present suit with their more
<hi>sprightly</hi> and <hi>flourishing</hi> yeares: <hi>Age</hi>

               <p>If we should but a while take notice how many <hi>Riots,</hi> the

should be readier to <hi>lose</hi> our <hi>selves</hi> in Admiration of their

the <hi>measure</hi> of their <hi>Gallantry</hi> by the <hi>strength</hi> of
their <hi>Brains,</hi> or <hi>Capacity</hi> of their <hi>Bellies:</hi> to hear
them there drawing up with so much complacency an <hi>Inventory</hi> and
<hi>Catalogue</hi> of all their <hi>sinfull</hi> extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances, and in a

hear them <hi>roaring</hi> themselves <hi>out</hi> of <hi>breath,</hi> never
taking leave of their <hi>wine,</hi> but of their <hi>senses</hi> too: nor
forbearing their <hi>Oaths</hi> 'till they be able to <hi>speak</hi> no more;
would you believe these men could ever be so <hi>sober,</hi> as to
<hi>mention</hi> the names of <hi>Christian</hi> or <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet 'tis most <hi>certain</hi> as well as <hi>sad,</hi> that
you can never be more sure to meet with our <hi>Gentry</hi> in any place, then
at these <hi>Academies</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> and <hi>Nurseries</hi> of
<hi>unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> there <hi>exercising</hi> their <hi>abilities,</hi> and

challenge</hi> the <hi>Almighly</hi> into the <hi>field,</hi> and <hi>dare</hi>
him to doe the <hi>worst</hi> he <hi>can.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But (alas) we need not seek so great an advantage over them, as to
<hi>take</hi> them there, where they have so often <hi>lost</hi> themselves,
and it heartily grieves me, as certainly it must do every <hi>Charitable
Christian,</hi> to see them so desperately <hi>madded</hi> with the
<hi>fear</hi> of being accounted <hi>Holy;</hi> and so ravenously
<hi>greedy</hi> of eternall <hi>destruction,</hi> as thus to <hi>swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi>
it down by whole <hi>Bowles,</hi> and make their Companions <hi>Merry</hi> at
the working out of <pb n="188" facs="tcp:42817:104"/> their own <hi>Damnation.</hi>
Doubtlesse <hi>Sathan</hi> hath but two much Power over these men when they are
most <hi>Sober,</hi> they need not give him the <hi>advantage</hi> of finding
them so often <hi>drunk.</hi> Except in a <hi>Gallantry</hi> they desire to
show the world how <hi>boldly</hi> they dare <hi>desie Heaven,</hi> and how
much they <hi>Scorne</hi> to <hi>owe</hi> their <hi>ruine</hi> to <hi>any</hi>
but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>At such <hi>good</hi> places as these, is it, that our
<hi>Gentlemen</hi> make all their <hi>Bargains, entertain</hi> all their
<hi>friends, treat</hi> all their <hi>Ladies:</hi> here they <hi>Consult</hi>
about the weightiest affaires of the <hi>Commonwealth; Seal</hi> and
<hi>Confirme</hi> all their agreements in the very hight of their
<hi>Intemperance;</hi> as if they were afraid they should <hi>know</hi> or
<hi>remember</hi> hereafter what then they did; or as if they were Confident
<hi>then</hi> to be in a Capacity of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things <hi>best,</hi> when they
were <hi>lest</hi> of all themselves: There can be no <hi>meeting,</hi> at

surer pledg of <hi>friendship,</hi> or tie of a <hi>Civill Correspondence</hi>
and <hi>Familiarity,</hi> then by being thus <hi>Drunk</hi> together, or at

               <p>And now all this <hi>Madnesse,</hi> must be <pb n="189" facs="tcp:42817:104"/>
thought no worse then the <hi>Demonstration</hi> of that <hi>Civillity</hi> and
<hi>Courtesy</hi> which they owe one another; a <hi>necessary kindnesse</hi> or
an <hi>handsome treatment:</hi> And who so refuses either to goe along with
them, or to doe as they do when he is there, he is no better then an
<hi>uncivill fellow,</hi> and no <hi>Companion</hi> for <hi>Gentlemen:</hi>
what a <hi>disgrace</hi> is it held for a man to leave a <hi>drop</hi> in the

not to pledge every man his <hi>wholeone?</hi> And not to admit every
<hi>Health,</hi> it is no lesse then the greatest disrespect and
<hi>Injury</hi> can be offer'd to the <hi>person</hi> in remembrance; whosoever
refuseth it, especially if it be a <hi>Lady</hi> or a <hi>Minion</hi> is
remembred, shall be sure to hear of it with an <hi>Oath</hi> now, and perhaps a
<hi>Challenge anon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>More <hi>Ceremony</hi> is used, and more <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> by
halfe, to <hi>set off</hi> their drunken <hi>Revels,</hi> then to
<hi>grace</hi> the <hi>Worship</hi> and service of their <hi>God:</hi> All must
be <hi>bare,</hi> and all upon their <hi>knees,</hi> and a <hi>Catch</hi>
instead of an <hi>Hymne:</hi> this is their <hi>morning</hi> and their
<hi>Evening De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion;</hi> but whether this be the true <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> of
their <hi>God,</hi> or the <hi>businesse</hi> of <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> I dare
appeal to those <hi>Consciences</hi> of <pb n="190" facs="tcp:42817:105"/> their's, which
they now endeavour so to <hi>si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> and <hi>Drown</hi> both by their
<hi>Drinking</hi> and their <hi>Roaring.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, it seems very evident, that even these <hi>Gentlemen</hi>
themselves make this <hi>Sottish passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time</hi> the most infallible
<hi>marke</hi> of true <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry:</hi> and account him a person of
<hi>worth,</hi> and without all exceptions <hi>fit</hi> for <hi>their</hi>
Company, whosoever can but <hi>take off</hi> his <hi>Cups</hi> handsomely, and
is versed in all the <hi>Methods</hi> and <hi>Maximes</hi> of this <hi>Hellish
Art.</hi> Indeed they have made it a kind of <hi>Science,</hi> and have given
it so many <hi>rules</hi> and <hi>lawes</hi> of late, that he that will now be
<hi>expert</hi> in it, had need to serve out an <hi>Apprenticeship</hi> to
learne all the <hi>Circumstances</hi> and <hi>termes,</hi> though he be never
so perfect in the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> before. <hi>Any</hi> person how
<hi>Contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible</hi> soever shall not be thought unworthy of their Company,
if he be but the <hi>Master</hi> of this <hi>Art.</hi> Even he whom they would
almost scorne to own for a <hi>man</hi> when <hi>Sober</hi> and in his
<hi>right wits,</hi> when he is <hi>Drunk</hi> or <hi>Mad,</hi> though but a
<hi>Tinker</hi> or a <hi>Cobler,</hi> he is a Companion for <hi>Gentlemen.</hi>
I do not grudg the poor fellowes the <hi>Honour</hi> of such <hi>Society,</hi>
nor indeed can I think it any: But <pb n="191" facs="tcp:42817:105"/> I am more the

               <p>To perswade the <hi>Gentleman</hi> to be <hi>good,</hi> a man
would think were no <hi>hard</hi> taske, seeing he takes it so ill out, that
any man should <hi>suspect</hi> him to be <hi>otherwise:</hi> and yet
not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, it may well be thought a very <hi>difficult</hi> and

<hi>blind</hi> whensoever it should look upon it's own <hi>faults;</hi> so is
it altogether as <hi>deaf</hi> when it should hearken to <hi>instruction.</hi>
Yet because the <hi>Difficulty</hi> lies not so much in making him

how <hi>rationall</hi> a thing it is for him to be, what he himselfe so well
<hi>knowes,</hi> he should bee.</p>
               <p>I intend not here to trouble you or him with any large Encomium of
<hi>Vertue</hi> or <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> which would swell up this Discourse much

<hi>would</hi> infallnbly be prevalent and Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall.</p>
               <p>The <hi>first</hi> and <hi>slightest</hi> which I shall here most
humbly offer to his serious Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is an argument which he too often
makes use of to a <hi>worse</hi> purpose, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by suffers his
<hi>sensuall</hi> to gain the <hi>victory</hi> over his <hi>Spirituall</hi>
selfe. And this is taken from that <hi>Topick</hi> of <hi>Common Civility,</hi>
which naturally obliges him to make <hi>suitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes</hi> to those many
<hi>reall kindnesses</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects which the <hi>best</hi> of his
<hi>friends</hi> have ever had for him. I shall beseech him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, how
whensoever he is by the swing of his own <hi>dominering lusts,</hi> no lesse
then by the <hi>attractive vices</hi> of his acquaintance drawn to a
<hi>Taverne,</hi> or carried on to any other <hi>excesse</hi> or <hi>riot,</hi>
it is to this <hi>one pretence</hi> be confidently betakes himselfe for
Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; that he was meerly <hi>drawn in</hi> by the <hi>Civility</hi> of
others, and that he was not able to resist the <hi>Importunity</hi> of his
<hi>friends;</hi> that <hi>Common Courtesy</hi> did strongly oblige him, not to
show himselfe <hi>reguardlesse</hi> of his <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,</hi> 
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:42817:113"/> by forsaking <hi>their Company</hi> who had expressed
themselves so <hi>desirous,</hi> and had taken so much pains to enjoy
<hi>his.</hi> I wish he would but call to mind what weight this argument hath
when pressed upon him by his <hi>lewdest</hi> companions, and assisted by his
own forward <hi>Inclinations</hi> to that which is <hi>evill;</hi> and how
infinitely <hi>more</hi> force then it ought to have, when made use of by such
as <hi>really</hi> desire his <hi>happinesse,</hi> and applied to that which in

               </p>
               <p>Would the Gentleman but open his ears, how many <hi>reall

he cannot either with <hi>Civility</hi> or <hi>Gratitude</hi> refuse, every

to <hi>walk</hi> along with <hi>them</hi> in those <hi>paths</hi> which will
lead him thereunto. I might here tell him how heartily <hi>God himselfe</hi>
calls and <hi>Invites</hi> him, and daily sends abroad his <hi>Messengers</hi>
early and late to <hi>beg</hi> and <hi>intreat</hi> him to <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi> of
his <hi>Invitation;</hi> how he has prepared his <hi>Oxen</hi> and his

to a <hi>Feast of Fat things,</hi> and to <hi>drink wine and milk without

a <hi>Ring,</hi> nay with a <hi>Crown</hi> and a <hi>Kingdome</hi> to welcome
them. Can it now be judged <hi>Civility</hi> to refuse and <hi>slight</hi> the
<hi>Invitation</hi> of so <hi>Bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> and <hi>Indulgent</hi> a
<hi>father?</hi> I might tell him how the <hi>Angels</hi> in Heaven even
<hi>long</hi> for his Company, and will be <hi>overjoy'd</hi> to see him, and
to hear him exercising that <hi>voice</hi> so long abused in <hi>warbling</hi>

Is it not a <hi>disgrace</hi> for a man <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi> to be <hi>cheated
wherein</hi> he hath ever thought himselfe to be the <hi>wisest</hi> of all
men; and to have such <hi>tricks</hi> put upon him, by what he most
<hi>Confides in,</hi> as will cast a <hi>damp</hi> upon all his

best <hi>Affections</hi> upon a <hi>meer cheat:</hi> and yet that <hi>Gentile
Sinner</hi> we speak of (if ever any) is highly guilty of this <hi>Folly.</hi>
He may as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure himselfe, if he repent not in due time, <hi>Sathan</hi> will put
the same <hi>cheat</hi> upon him, whereby he so sadly beguiled his <hi>wise
Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> in the <hi>Gospel;</hi> whom in <hi>that very night,</hi> when he
<hi>Lullaby'd</hi> his soul into a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse <hi>security,</hi> by
presenting to her eye the <hi>abundance</hi> of his <hi>riches;</hi> he
suddenly snat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches away into the place of Torments, and makes this
<hi>addition</hi> to the <hi>rest</hi> of his <hi>Sorrowes,</hi> that he
<hi>derides</hi> his former <hi>security,</hi> and <hi>laughs</hi> at his
present <hi>misery.</hi> But this is too <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> and <hi>Copious</hi>
a <hi>Theme</hi> to dwell any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger upon; I durst not altogether omit to

more frequently prevalent with the <hi>Gentleman,</hi> to <hi>perswade</hi> him
to <hi>sin,</hi> then this <hi>fear</hi> of <hi>shame</hi> and
<hi>Disgrace;</hi> and if it have been so powerfull to hurry him on to his

               <p>I shall but propose two <hi>Considerations</hi> more, and these

               </p>
               <p>And <hi>first,</hi> in all <hi>aequity</hi> and <hi>justice</hi>
the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman</hi> ought to proportion his <hi>Gratitude,</hi> to the
<hi>Bounty</hi> which enrich'd him; and to live a <hi>Gentleman</hi> is as
little as can, with any reason, be thought a just <hi>requitall</hi> of his
<hi>Goodnesse</hi> who made <hi>him</hi> more <hi>Honourable</hi> then
<hi>others.</hi> For it was not <hi>he himselfe</hi> by whom he was made
<hi>better then another man,</hi> neither hath <hi>he any thing which he hath
not received.</hi> It cannot therefore be <hi>Gratitude</hi> in him like a
<hi>Spongy</hi> substance, to <hi>suck</hi> in <hi>all</hi> 
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:42817:119"/> which is proffer'd it, but to <hi>return nothing</hi>
again without a <hi>Squeezing:</hi> Or like a black and heavy <hi>clod</hi> of
earth, to receive the most <hi>Courteous</hi> and <hi>enlivening rayes</hi> of
Heaven, and yet requite the <hi>Bounty</hi> neither by a <hi>present cheerfull
reflection,</hi> nor a <hi>future seasonable fructification:</hi> neither yet
to lie like a rotten <hi>Dunghill,</hi> which repaies all the sweet
<hi>Influence</hi> it participates of, in a <hi>stenchy</hi> fume, or a
<hi>generation of Vermine.</hi> He should rather labour to resemble the true
<hi>Christall,</hi> whose property it is either to <hi>transmit</hi> or
<hi>reflect</hi> those rayes it receives, with great <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage</hi> of
<hi>light</hi> to the <hi>darker objects</hi> about it; and of a more
<hi>visible splendor</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> to the <hi>light</hi> it selfe. A

that his <hi>light so shine before men, that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his works</hi>
rather then his <hi>person</hi> (as the <hi>Sun</hi> gives us a

               <p>The <hi>Gentleman</hi> is apt to boast himselfe much of his

<hi>Good-husbandry,</hi> which is bestow'd upon him? Shall he like a

and the <hi>Musick</hi> ceases, and in a short time, the <hi>strings
crack,</hi> and the <hi>Pegs fall,</hi> and the <hi>Noble</hi> Instrument
growes <hi>mouldy</hi> and <hi>worm-eaten?</hi> Is it not most
<hi>unnaturall,</hi> that he who has all these great <hi>advantages</hi> in his
youth, which others do often in <hi>vain,</hi> and he himselfe too often 
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:42817:122"/> when it is <hi>too late, wish</hi> to enjoy, should not
doe something whereby he might shew all that <hi>care</hi> and <hi>cost,</hi>
not quite <hi>thrown away</hi> and <hi>mispent?</hi> And yet much more, that he
should only so behave himselfe, as one that knowes how readily to
<hi>forget,</hi> whatever had cost him so much <hi>time,</hi> and
<hi>pains,</hi> and <hi>Money</hi> in acquiring; and one that can now make
<hi>that</hi> a part of his <hi>glory, which</hi> indeed is no small argument
of <hi>shame,</hi> that he <hi>once had</hi> a little learning, and <hi>Might
have been</hi> a <hi>Christian,</hi> had he not had <hi>wit</hi> enough to
<hi>befool</hi> himselfe, and so become a <hi>Gentleman.</hi> It troubles me to
<hi>say</hi> that very many of our <hi>English Gentlemen</hi> do thus
<hi>Commence</hi> (as it were) and take <hi>Degrees</hi> in <hi>Ignorance</hi>
and <hi>Vanity,</hi> I wish it troubled him as much to <hi>doe so.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, it were but <hi>just,</hi> our <hi>Gentlemen</hi> should
think upon their <hi>large portions</hi> and <hi>fair Inheritances,</hi> and so
take the <hi>Measure</hi> of their <hi>Duties,</hi> by their <hi>liberall
allowances.</hi> To <hi>have</hi> an estate makes not man <hi>Happy,</hi> but
to <hi>use</hi> an estate <hi>wisely</hi> may bring a man very <hi>farre</hi>
on his way towards it. O let it never be said of the <hi>Gentleman,</hi> what
is recorded to the perpetuall dishonour of the <hi>Young <pb n="226" facs="tcp:42817:123"/>
Man</hi> (he knowes [I hope] where) that he <hi>departed</hi> from
<hi>Christ</hi> because he was <hi>very rich.</hi> It is certainly a mistake in
any man, to think, a man's <hi>soul</hi> may no way <hi>feed</hi> and grow
<hi>fat,</hi> upon his <hi>wealth:</hi> or to say a man may not become a
<hi>Better man,</hi> by having <hi>greater possessions. Wisedome's seven
Pillars</hi> are most readily <hi>erected,</hi> and firmly <hi>grounded</hi>
upon a <hi>Basis</hi> of <hi>Gold:</hi> And <hi>Vertue</hi> cannot there have
the <hi>best fair,</hi> and <hi>thrive</hi> most, though she may have a
<hi>kind welcome,</hi> where <hi>Poverty</hi> keeps the house. Though the
<hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi> of <hi>Wisdome</hi> and <hi>knowledg</hi> lie not in the
<hi>Chist,</hi> yet are they for the most part so <hi>lock'd</hi> up, that he
who would at any time come readily at them, must not sail to carry the
<hi>Key</hi> in his <hi>Pocket.</hi> Though <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety</hi>
may live <hi>Quietly</hi> and <hi>Contentedly</hi> under a <hi>thatch'd</hi>
roof, and may meet with such entertainment as may preserve <hi>life;</hi> yet,
alas, they are but <hi>there</hi> as in <hi>Prison,</hi> and shall hardly
obtain the <hi>Liberty</hi> to walk much <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad</hi> except there be
something in the <hi>purse</hi> to purchase their <hi>freedome:</hi> Without
this they may have what fetter'd <hi>Captives</hi> may enjoy, their
<hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>tongues,</hi> but very sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome their <hi>hands</hi> or
<hi>feet</hi> at liberty. What <pb n="227" facs="tcp:42817:123"/> rare perfections might be
attain'd to, and what wonders wrought, had but either the <hi>Rich
Gentleman</hi> the <hi>poor man's soul,</hi> or the <hi>Poor man</hi> the
<hi>Rich Gentleman's purse?</hi> What a shame is it, that he whom God hath
bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with enough to buy the <hi>Precious Pearl,</hi> should rather chuse to
lay it out upon an <hi>Hobby-Horse;</hi> that he should suffer either
<hi>Himselfe</hi> to be a <hi>Fool,</hi> or <hi>Vertue</hi> a <hi>Beggar,</hi>
when it is in his power to prevent both? If his <hi>wealth</hi> know not what
to doe with his <hi>Vertue,</hi> let him give <hi>Vertue</hi> the <hi>key,</hi>
and she knowes how to make use of his <hi>wealth.</hi> What an
<hi>ungratefull</hi> fool is he, who with what is given him will neither
fulfill the <hi>Donor's</hi> will, nor make use of the gift to his <hi>own</hi>
advantage? How might the <hi>Church</hi> become truly <hi>Glorious,</hi> and
her <hi>rayment</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally of <hi>wrought Gold,</hi> how might the
<hi>Poore</hi> man grow <hi>Rich,</hi> and the <hi>Rich</hi> man <hi>Good</hi>
and <hi>Happy,</hi> did the <hi>Gentleman</hi> study to make that improvement,
which he ought to make of this one <hi>talent,</hi> and not either with the
Raunting <hi>Prodigall</hi> waste his inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance by <hi>riotous living;</hi>
or with the other <hi>Ill-husband</hi> and <hi>foolish servant,</hi> wrap it up

                  <hi>Earth</hi> of a <hi>Worldly</hi> mind?</p>
               <p>There is a <hi>third</hi> obligation whereby the
<hi>Gentleman</hi> in <hi>equity</hi> is bound to outgoe his Inferiours, no
lesse in <hi>Goodnesse</hi> then in <hi>Wealth</hi> and <hi>Pomp.</hi> I mean
an <hi>Immunity</hi> from the <hi>Drudgeries</hi> of the World: <hi>Nature</hi>
and <hi>Fortune</hi> both seem to consent in gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him a

<hi>Pharaoh-like</hi> Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a <hi>Necessitous</hi> Condition, many a

his body in his own <hi>sweat;</hi> nor <hi>lives,</hi> as other men are often
constrain'd to doe, almost by a <hi>wearisomenesse</hi> of <hi>living:</hi> But
seems to plead an <hi>Exemption</hi> from that part of <hi>Adam's</hi> Curse,
whereby he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>in the sweat, of his Browes to eat his
bread.</hi> Whilest many others by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall <hi>labour,</hi> seem from

men's too; and, like the poor <hi>Israelites,</hi> when driven out of
<hi>Aegypt,</hi> to run up and down with their <hi>kneeding-troughs</hi> upon
their Shoulders. They carry both their <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>livelihoods</hi>
to and fro in their <hi>hands;</hi> and by a <hi>toilesome</hi> improvement of
the <hi>Gentleman's</hi> vast estate, <pb n="229" facs="tcp:42817:124"/> pick up for
themselves a very scant subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. He eats the <hi>fat,</hi> and drinks the
<hi>sweet,</hi> and has <hi>one</hi> part of him alwaies provided for to his
hand; and ought not this to lay a strong obligation upon him, to take more
pains about the <hi>other?</hi> Ought not this to bind him to the ready service
of his <hi>God,</hi> who has made the whole <hi>world</hi> in a manner to serve
<hi>him?</hi> Certainly he never had a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Dispensation</hi> granted
him from all <hi>labour,</hi> but onely from the more <hi>slavish</hi> and
<hi>drudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> part of it; that the lesse he has to care for besides, the
more time he should have to care for his <hi>soul</hi> and <hi>Heaven.</hi> It
was <hi>Adam's</hi> growing <hi>wanton</hi> in <hi>Eden,</hi> where the
<hi>Earth</hi> freely brought forth all things of it selfe, and where his
<hi>taske</hi> of labouring was but his <hi>Recreation</hi> not his
<hi>toyl,</hi> which sent him first abroad to <hi>sweat</hi> in the
<hi>World,</hi> and to wage a Constant <hi>warre</hi> with <hi>Bryars</hi> and
<hi>Thistles.</hi> And if the <hi>Gentleman</hi> will not take some pains to
dresse the <hi>Garden</hi> of his Soul, when all the world seems to be so much
his own round about him, that <hi>one</hi> part of it is his <hi>Steward,</hi>

obscured and hid, but his rayes are withheld from the <hi>world</hi> below, and
a <hi>Malignant Influence</hi> scatter'd abroad upon <hi>Inferior</hi> Bodies.
It is a very hard matter for a <hi>Gentleman</hi> to be bad <hi>alone;</hi> I
dare say, his heart will bear witnesse, that he owes not a few of his own sins
to the powerfull <hi>Example</hi> of his <hi>superiours;</hi> and that he has
very often resisted the more <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> and <hi>vertuous</hi> inclinations
of his <hi>own</hi> soul, and the more <hi>rationall</hi> dictates of his
<hi>own</hi> judgment, onely out of an <hi>Ambitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi> to make
himselfe Company for <hi>great ones;</hi> and because he was <hi>ashamed</hi>
to be found <hi>lesse</hi> then a <hi>Gentleman</hi> in <hi>any</hi> thing,
though in <hi>Sin</hi> it selfe. Let him therefore consider how much it will
Concerne him, who is the true <hi>Loadstone</hi> of the <hi>Nation,</hi> whose
<hi>Motion</hi> the poor <hi>Iron soules</hi> of the multitude with trembling
<hi>expect;</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving <hi>follow,</hi> to turne himselfe alwaies to
the <hi>right Pole.</hi> I wish the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of our Island would
remember this, that by their vices they prove not onely <hi>Bad</hi> in
<hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> but <hi>unjust</hi> to their <hi>Neighbours:</hi> that 
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:42817:127"/> so they may see how much in <hi>equity</hi> they are

               <head>§. 7. A fourth Motive from Honour and Reputation.</head>
               <p>The other <hi>mark</hi> to which I would gladly perswade the
<hi>Gentleman</hi> to turne his <hi>eye,</hi> is that which he pretends to
<hi>aime</hi> at most; his <hi>Honour</hi> or <hi>Reputation;</hi> things (If
you'l believe him) whereof he is more <hi>tender</hi> then his <hi>life;</hi>
but let us see how he will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make this good, for I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he values much, what he takes to pains to <hi>preserve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The main <hi>Character</hi> of an <hi>Honourable</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, is
a great care in him, never to doe any thing below his <hi>Name,</hi> or which
may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon his <hi>Progenitors</hi> or his <hi>Family</hi> with
<hi>shame</hi> and <hi>disparagement.</hi> He therefore can admit no emploiment
which is <hi>base</hi> or <hi>low,</hi> but as his <hi>Honour</hi> was at first
<hi>raised,</hi> so he studies to maintain it at that <hi>height,</hi> by some
<hi>noble</hi> and <hi>Gallant</hi> atchievement. But how truly <hi>tender</hi>
is he of his <hi>Honour,</hi> who thus (as we have said before) is willing to
<hi>degrade</hi> himselfe into a <hi>Beast,</hi> and to <hi>trample</hi> 
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:42817:127"/> upon his <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>humanity</hi> at once?
He that can <hi>bend</hi> his proud neck to the most <hi>galling Yoak</hi>
which <hi>Sathan</hi> can put upon him; and patiently <hi>kneeles</hi> him down
to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive so many loads of <hi>Dirt</hi> upon his back? who scornes not to
<hi>drudg</hi> for the <hi>Worst</hi> and <hi>Basest</hi> of <hi>Masters,</hi>
and that in his <hi>meanest</hi> and most <hi>Beggarly</hi> service, when he
sends him out (with the <hi>Young Prodigall)</hi> into the <hi>field</hi> of
Carnall pleasures, there to <hi>feed</hi> a few <hi>swi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> lusts: and
all this too, upon hopes of the <hi>slenderest</hi> reward here, a few
deceitfull <hi>Husks,</hi> and in dayly fear and expectation of the most
dreadfull <hi>punishment</hi> hereafter, that of <hi>Endlesse
torments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Gentleman</hi> that values his <hi>honour,</hi> will be
sure not to mix with any <hi>Company,</hi> but such, from whom he may reap both
<hi>Credit</hi> and <hi>profit;</hi> such as will be no <hi>lets</hi> to him in
his vertuous <hi>progresse,</hi> nor <hi>blemish</hi> to his desired
<hi>Reputation.</hi> But alas how little do those <hi>Gentlemen</hi> reguard
either of these, who indeed care for no <hi>Companions</hi> but such as have
made themselves altogether the <hi>Creatures</hi> of their <hi>vices,</hi> and
the neerest <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors</hi> of their <hi>Lusts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truly <hi>Honourable Gentleman,</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies 
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:42817:128"/> most <hi>faithfull</hi> and <hi>punctuall</hi> in the
performance of his <hi>promises,</hi> and showeth himselfe to be as
<hi>Good</hi> as his <hi>word,</hi> esteeming no <hi>disgrace</hi> like that of
<hi>deserving</hi> the <hi>Lie.</hi> Every <hi>promise</hi> he makes, he pawns
his <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> and <hi>Reputation,</hi> to secure the
<hi>perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance;</hi> and looks upon no <hi>disrespect</hi> as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
with that, of not being thought a person fit to be <hi>trusted.</hi> But how
little care do our <hi>Gentlemen</hi> take to maintain <hi>this</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of their <hi>Credit;</hi> who <hi>swear</hi> so frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to, they
<hi>know</hi> not, or <hi>heed</hi> not what, that they cannot possibly so much
as <hi>remember,</hi> much lesse <hi>discharge</hi> one third part of their
<hi>Oaths.</hi> These upon every <hi>slight</hi> or <hi>no</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion they
send out in such <hi>Volleyes,</hi> and with so much <hi>Inconsideration</hi>
and <hi>temerity,</hi> that they cannot have time to Consider whether one halfe
of what they swear be <hi>true</hi> or <hi>false.</hi> Nay there is one solemne
<hi>Vow,</hi> and that the most <hi>sacred</hi> one that ever they made, and to
a <hi>person</hi> with whom it most Concernes them to be punctuall and deal
faithfully, I mean that at their <hi>Baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me;</hi> which, alas, they so well
<hi>performe,</hi> as that they hardly ever <hi>call to mind,</hi> or can
<hi>believe</hi> there was any <hi>such thing</hi> done by 
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:42817:128"/> them: Was it not <hi>this</hi> that then they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
to <hi>Forsake the Divell and all his works, the vain pomp and glory of the
World, with all the Covetous desires of the same, and all the Carnall desires
of the flesh, so that they would neither follow nor be lead by them?</hi> In
which, the engagement of their <hi>Honour</hi> would not serve the turne, but
they brought their <hi>sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and <hi>Bondmen,</hi> who promised (as
much as in them lay) to see all made good; I trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to think how this vow has
been fulfil'd by all those persons who would be thought <hi>so</hi> sensible of
<hi>Honour,</hi> that their bare <hi>word</hi> might at any time serve for
their <hi>Bond.</hi> What they vow'd to <hi>forsake,</hi> they with all
earnestnesse <hi>follow;</hi> and that whereby they would not be <hi>led,</hi>
they sweat to <hi>Outgoe.</hi> Hugging and embracing those <hi>temptations</hi>
they promised to abandon, and making the <hi>Vaine Pomp and Glory of the
World</hi> the onely <hi>Gods</hi> they dare <hi>love</hi> and <hi>adore.</hi>
If the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman</hi> be thus carelesse in maintaining his
<hi>Credit,</hi> thus false in his <hi>promises</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and his
<hi>Soul,</hi> I hope he will not think it strange, if others be so scrupulous
and weak-faith'd, as not to believe him to be a <hi>Gentleman</hi> upon his own
bare <hi>word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:42817:129"/> Further yet, he that desires to be truly
<hi>Honourable,</hi> and esteem'd soe; Will so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for his
<hi>Honour,</hi> that the world may have no just cause to throw the
miscarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and sins of his <hi>Country</hi> upon <hi>his</hi> shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or
that all the <hi>Miseries</hi> thereof should be found the <hi>Daughters</hi>
of <hi>his Vices.</hi> But whether or no we have any reason to blame the
<hi>English Gentleman</hi> for the Calamities of his <hi>Nation,</hi> I appeal
to himselfe, let his <hi>Conscience</hi> determine it. To whom shall we impute
the <hi>Blindnesse,</hi> the <hi>Ignorance,</hi> the <hi>Giddinesse</hi> of the
<hi>People,</hi> but to him that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be the <hi>eye</hi> and the
<hi>head?</hi> We know it is the <hi>Lightnesse</hi> of the <hi>head,</hi>
which often makes the <hi>heels</hi> stand <hi>uppermost;</hi> And when we see
a Drunkard <hi>reel</hi> and <hi>staggar,</hi> we all know it is the
<hi>Giddinesse</hi> of his <hi>head</hi> which causes his <hi>uneven</hi>
motion. It were happy for us, if all those who would be thought the
<hi>Heads</hi> of this <hi>Headlesse Nation,</hi> would daily consider their
office; and how much of the <hi>Crazinesse</hi> and <hi>Distemper</hi> of this
<hi>Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated</hi> people, is to be imputed to the unset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lednesse of their
own <hi>Brains,</hi> and want of a due <hi>Government</hi> of themselves. O
that the World might no longer have just cause to <pb n="239" facs="tcp:42817:129"/> say
(as now many are apt to doe) that the sad <hi>disease</hi> of this poor
Kingdome, wherein it has well nigh <hi>Cough'd</hi> out it's very heart,
proceed from a <hi>cold</hi> it has taken in the <hi>Noblest</hi> members of
its <hi>Body:</hi> and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is <hi>Atheisme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If therefore our Gentlemen ever intend to <hi>deserve</hi> that
<hi>honour,</hi> they so egerly <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,</hi> let them learn to <hi>be</hi>
and <hi>Act</hi> like <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> so shall they assure themselves of
true <hi>Honour</hi> both before <hi>God</hi> and amongst <hi>men.</hi> Let
them pluck up their <hi>Courage,</hi> and make it appeare to the World, that
they have yet something of a <hi>Noble</hi> and <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Spirit</hi>
within their breasts; that they dare yet own a <hi>God,</hi> in despight of
<hi>Atheisme</hi> and <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> and stand up for his <hi>Church</hi>
in opposition to <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Sacriledg:</hi> that they have
<hi>Spirits</hi> above the reach of <hi>Swords,</hi> and <hi>Souls</hi> not to
be out-braved by the terrours of the <hi>Grave;</hi> nor <hi>blown</hi> out of
their bodies with the proud and threatning <hi>breath</hi> of those that can
but <hi>seem</hi> mighty. Let it once be seen that they have espoused a
<hi>Religion</hi> which has a <hi>Majesty</hi> enough to Daunt a
<hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> with the hottest <hi>furnace</hi> in his <hi>Mouth:</hi>
and an <hi>Holy zeal,</hi> 
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:42817:130"/> which (as the Brighter
<hi>Sun beams</hi> doe upon the fainter light of a <hi>Candle</hi>) can prey
upon, and <hi>Consume</hi> to nothing, the most scorching <hi>flames</hi> of
<hi>Persecution.</hi> When they have learn'd to take the <hi>roaring Lion</hi>
by the <hi>Iawes,</hi> and pull out his teeth; when they can (with the stout
Champion of <hi>Israel)</hi> defend the endanger'd <hi>Church</hi> against that
great <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi> of <hi>Atheisme,</hi> which now or never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares with

prosecute the <hi>Metaphor</hi> a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and I would fain say, that
those <hi>Glitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, spangled soules,</hi> are most <hi>Noble</hi> and
<hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,</hi> which <hi>Wise Nature</hi> treats with the greatest
<hi>respect</hi> and <hi>Ceremonie;</hi> those, for whom, as her <hi>Chiefe
Guests</hi> she hath reserved her most <hi>stately,</hi> and <hi>fairest</hi>
roomes: that <hi>these,</hi> if any, are to be thought the <hi>Gentlemen</hi>
of the world, to whom <hi>Nature</hi> as well as <hi>Fortune</hi> seems to pay
a <hi>reverence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are the <hi>Men</hi> who enter into the world with that
<hi>Ceremonious state</hi> and <hi>Pomp,</hi> that would almost perswade us
they were sent hither on an <hi>Ambassy</hi> from Heaven. They are indulged an
<hi>Honour</hi> seemingly too great for <hi>Mortallity.</hi> They are
<hi>admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> 
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:42817:132"/> into the world by the most
<hi>beautifull gate</hi> of a <hi>Renowned Parentage,</hi> they are
<hi>ush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er'd</hi> along with all that <hi>Pompe</hi> and
<hi>Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence,</hi> which use to attend our <hi>highest hopes</hi> and most
<hi>teeming Expectations;</hi> and are most significant of our <hi>greatest
joyes:</hi> Their <hi>births</hi> are congratulated, and <hi>they</hi>
welco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med hither, with a <hi>long</hi> and <hi>Methodically order'd</hi> train
of <hi>solemne</hi> and <hi>Honourable</hi> both <hi>Civill</hi> and

<hi>Comely</hi> and <hi>wel-featured</hi> Bodies; in ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whereof the
<hi>Divine Art</hi> of <hi>Better Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> hath best shown it selfe; these
are Gloriously set forth by all those most lively <hi>Images</hi> of
<hi>Majesty</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> which <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Nature</hi> can be
thought capable of receiving: All these are more sweetned, by a lovely
<hi>prospect</hi> into the world abroad, where an <hi>Indulgent fortune,</hi>
to give the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>rellish</hi> to the gifts of <hi>Nature,</hi> presents
her selfe in all variety of <hi>Dresses,</hi> of <hi>Riches, Pleasures,

               <p>And now, <hi>Sir,</hi> would any man seeing <pb n="246" facs="tcp:42817:133"/>
all this, think it possible, that after <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Fortune,</hi>
and the <hi>Great God</hi> of <hi>Both,</hi> by so long a <hi>Succession</hi>
of no lesse truly <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable</hi> then indeed <hi>inestimable</hi>
blessings, have been so <hi>industriously Solicitous</hi> for the

have Constantly <hi>Courted</hi> his soul, to be in <hi>love</hi> with that
<hi>fair hand</hi> which made it; to invite it to an early <hi>sense</hi> of
it's own <hi>worth</hi> and <hi>excellency,</hi> and to set a due
<hi>estimate</hi> upon <hi>it selfe;</hi> to possesse it with the true
<hi>Apprehensions</hi> of that, which is certainly the highest <hi>Honour</hi>
that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall a <hi>mortall here</hi> or Crown him <hi>hereafter,</hi> I
mean his neer <hi>Relation</hi> to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>God</hi> of
<hi>Heaven</hi> his <hi>Maker:</hi> Would any man believe it possible after all
this, that the <hi>Gentleman</hi> should be either so <hi>uncharitable</hi> to
<hi>himselfe,</hi> or so <hi>ungratefull</hi> to his <hi>Creator:</hi> either
so much a <hi>Churle</hi> or a <hi>Fool,</hi> or <hi>Both:</hi> as neither to
yield to those <hi>Importunities</hi> of a <hi>Wooing Heaven:</hi> nor
<hi>Embrace</hi> the Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Invitations</hi> of an <hi>endlesse
Felicitie?</hi> Would you believe, that when he is <hi>intrusted</hi> by the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>Glories,</hi> upon so honourable an <hi>Expedition</hi> as
that of <hi>winning</hi> a <hi>Crown;</hi> he should be <hi>tyred</hi> and
<hi>foot-sore</hi> at the very <pb n="247" facs="tcp:42817:133"/> 
                  <hi>first</hi> step; and
sit down to <hi>rest</hi> him upon the first <hi>cold stone</hi> in his way,
there flattering his <hi>Childish Humour,</hi> in the <hi>Empty</hi> fruition
of some <hi>Garish</hi> but <hi>fading vanity?</hi> Could any man with a

<hi>toyes</hi> adequate to the <hi>Immense</hi> desires of an
<hi>Heaven-borne</hi> substance? Alas, who is ignorant, that these <hi>pretty
Glories,</hi> and <hi>little felicities,</hi> which so please us <hi>here,</hi>
cannot in any reason be thought <hi>more</hi> (seldome so <hi>much)</hi> then
the <hi>smaller tokens</hi> of a <hi>Father's Love,</hi> or an <hi>Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
penny</hi> to a future <hi>Inheritance;</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the <hi>Child</hi>
to <hi>keep</hi> his <hi>purse</hi> with whilest he is here at school: Nay,
they are so often <hi>lesse</hi> then this, that they amount not to so much, as
those <hi>lesse</hi> tokens, which we use to call the <hi>Mother's
Blessing;</hi> but are rather like the <hi>deceitfull</hi> Gifts of a
<hi>Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame,</hi> such as a <hi>brasse shilling,</hi> or a <hi>Gilded
Nutmeg,</hi> the <hi>slight kindnesse</hi> not of a <hi>Fond</hi> but a

               </p>
               <p>Doubtlesse, if the <hi>Gentleman</hi> find himselfe to be so much
<hi>Fortune's Darling,</hi> or (as he <pb n="248" facs="tcp:42817:134"/> would rather have
us think) the <hi>Favourite</hi> of <hi>Heaven:</hi> as to be afforded a more

dare hardly believe all this an <hi>Indulgence</hi> to <hi>sin,</hi> but an
<hi>encouragement</hi> unto <hi>Holinesse,</hi> and to go on with
<hi>Cheerfulnesse</hi> to see what that <hi>Good Father</hi> has in store for
him in <hi>Heaven,</hi> who is so <hi>liberall</hi> to him <hi>here</hi> upon
<hi>Earth.</hi> The Comfortable <hi>warmth</hi> of his <hi>Prosperous</hi>

or <hi>dry</hi> it up into a <hi>rebellious obstinacy:</hi> neither to give him

<hi>Dissolve</hi> his happinesse into the <hi>Aëry</hi> and

his soule into a <hi>Capacity</hi> of receiving <hi>more</hi> and

               </p>
               <p>If the <hi>Gentleman</hi> may boast of his honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable descent,

Imagine it halfe so <hi>Creditable,</hi> to swaggar it out with the <hi>Old

their yet <hi>surviving Virtues</hi> in himselfe their <hi>Genuine

               </p>
               <p>I am Confident the <hi>Gentleman</hi> needs not a remembrancer to

to show us, how well he can put on his <hi>Fathers old Cloaths,</hi> or play
his <hi>Ape</hi> in his <hi>Silver Ierkin?</hi> Is this the main <hi>Badg</hi>
of his <hi>Gentilitie,</hi> that he has never a <hi>Coat</hi> but what was

<hi>Master,</hi> a third a <hi>Good-your-Worship;</hi> and with these few
<hi>scraps</hi> he makes a shift to preserve <hi>alive</hi> his <hi>meagre</hi>
and <hi>raw-boned Reputation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>name</hi> that thus feeds onely upon the <hi>fragments</hi>
of <hi>charity,</hi> is not like to <hi>grow</hi> truly <hi>great</hi> in hast:
And a <hi>Reputation</hi> so long <hi>worn</hi> allready without
<hi>mending,</hi> is too <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>cheap</hi> for a true
<hi>Gentleman</hi> to appear abroad withall. The <hi>Cloak</hi> must needs be
very <hi>thread-bare,</hi> that is so <hi>old,</hi> and has bin so <hi>ill
used;</hi> It were more <hi>Noble</hi> to weare a <hi>New one</hi> of his own
<hi>buying,</hi> then that of his <hi>Great-grandfather</hi> which at best he
can by his <hi>scantling virtues</hi> onely fill full of <hi>patches.</hi> His
<hi>Father's Honour</hi> can be his but at <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond-hand:</hi> and to be
proud of an <hi>Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary title</hi> onely, is but to raunt it in a
<hi>Dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's suit,</hi> and like him, whom he too often Imitates, after his
<hi>father's death,</hi> to <hi>fright</hi> the world by <hi>appearing</hi> in
<hi>his likenesse;</hi> for when we come more narrowly to examine the
<hi>Reallity</hi> of what we <hi>think</hi> we <hi>see</hi> in him, we find
<hi>nothing</hi> but a <hi>cheat</hi> and <hi>Delusion</hi> of 
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:42817:136"/> the <hi>sense;</hi> we <hi>catch</hi> at a bare
<hi>Apparition</hi> for a <hi>substance;</hi> or at best <hi>grasp</hi> a
senselesse <hi>clod</hi> of cold <hi>clay</hi> insteed of a <hi>Man.</hi> What
is it to be thus Sollicitous after an <hi>Old Coat of Armes,</hi> but to wish
the <hi>Herald</hi> were a <hi>Broaker,</hi> And that he might buy <hi>old
scutche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> as he may <hi>old Cloaks,</hi> because his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi>
will not amount to the <hi>price</hi> of <hi>New ones.</hi> Whilest he thus
opens his <hi>Presse,</hi> and showes it to be well-lined with the rich
<hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell</hi> of those who lived <hi>before</hi> him, he does no more then
what often his father's <hi>Page</hi> or <hi>Lacquey</hi> is able to doe: Nay I
shall be bold to say it, whatever the <hi>Gentleman</hi> may therefore think of
<hi>himselfe</hi> or <hi>me,</hi> that he who showes his <hi>Father's
Bearing,</hi> without some <hi>Honourable Addition, due</hi> at lest, if not
<hi>given,</hi> to his <hi>own</hi> vertues, has but little more reason to
boast of his <hi>Gentility,</hi> then his <hi>Father's Fool</hi> or
<hi>Fidler,</hi> whom I have often observed to bear his <hi>Master's Coat</hi>
upon his <hi>Livory.</hi> O that the <hi>Gentleman</hi> would in good earnest
Consider, how much all <hi>Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men laugh at him,</hi> even in his
<hi>Finest</hi> Cloaths; and how much more all <hi>Good men</hi> doe
<hi>pitty</hi> him, when they see him with all his <hi>Borrow'd Bravery</hi>

                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:42817:137"/> He that will be a <hi>Gentleman</hi>
indeed, must look no lesse carefully <hi>before</hi> him, on what yet

<hi>Honour,</hi> then <hi>behind</hi> him, on what has been allready done by

Neither will a <hi>Prudent</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <hi>cover</hi> a dangerous breach in

thereby to Cozen the World into a false Opinion of his Counterfet

<hi>Nature,</hi> to <hi>Dig</hi> and <hi>plow</hi> the ground, these are the
<hi>Out-labourers</hi> of God's great <hi>Houshold,</hi> who by the greatnesse
of their <hi>Necessary</hi> Drudgery, take off much of the <hi>Burden</hi> from
the more <hi>refined</hi> sort of Mankind: The <hi>Gentleman</hi> God has
chosen to be as it were the <hi>steward</hi> of his <hi>Family,</hi> and
<hi>Guardian</hi> to his <hi>Church;</hi> and therefore in all
<hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Gratitude</hi> he ought to <pb n="257" facs="tcp:42817:138"/>
endeavour a due discharge of so great a <hi>trust.</hi> No <hi>Loyterer,</hi>
much lesse, a <hi>Spend-thrift,</hi> can be a member of <hi>his</hi> Family, we
know the certain wages of such <hi>unfaithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</hi> He then that
thinks himselfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from all that hardship which many others by a
<hi>leaden soul</hi> and an <hi>Iron Body,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the course usage of an
<hi>unkind Fortune,</hi> are <hi>Naturally</hi> or <hi>Casually</hi> sentenced
to, takes a very <hi>preposterous</hi> course, when he arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates to himselfe a
<hi>licence</hi> to do <hi>ill</hi> or to doe <hi>nothing:</hi> If the
<hi>Gentleman</hi> would be <hi>valued</hi> above others, it is but reason if
we require him to make it appear, that he is of better <hi>Mettall</hi> then
others which is to be judged of, not by the <hi>Colour,</hi> but
<hi>service.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would not see the <hi>Gentleman's Soul</hi> sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in his
<hi>beautifull Body,</hi> like a <hi>Breathless Idoll</hi> of <hi>Gold</hi> in
a <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Silver,</hi> there to be <hi>worship'd</hi> by
<hi>all,</hi> but doe <hi>good</hi> to <hi>none:</hi> It is not fit it should
be thought onely such a <hi>fine gay</hi> thing, as is sometimes by the
choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest of <hi>Naturall endowments</hi> and <hi>Artificiall accomplishments,
embellish'd</hi> into something more then ordinary, or <hi>burnish'd</hi> over
into such a slight superficiall <hi>gloss,</hi> as may make <hi>it,</hi> as
well as his <hi>Body, admired</hi> and <hi>gazed</hi> upon 
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:42817:139"/> by a few <hi>Ignorant</hi> worldlings; Neither should it
be his businesse to get his <hi>Body</hi> alwaies <hi>New-molded</hi> to the
varying hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the <hi>Court,</hi> and <hi>trick'd up</hi> in all the late
invented <hi>Gauderies, Gorgeous Accoutre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and <hi>Gingling
trappings,</hi> wherewith the <hi>Levity</hi> of <hi>Art</hi> has made bold to
<hi>overload</hi> and <hi>abuse</hi> the <hi>Modesty</hi> of Honest
<hi>Nature:</hi> He that has no <hi>Nobler</hi> a <hi>Soul</hi> or
<hi>Body</hi> then these, may still be no more then a meer <hi>Carcasse,</hi>
such as, if it expresse any <hi>motion,</hi> seems rather to be
<hi>actuated</hi> by the multitude of crawling <hi>vermine</hi> within it,
sprung from it's own <hi>Corruption,</hi> then by a true <hi>Rationall
soul</hi> inspired by <hi>God Allmighty.</hi> All the <hi>Salt</hi> of
<hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Ingenuity</hi> which such a person usually so much brags
of, will not be enough to preserve so <hi>putrid</hi> a Lump from
<hi>stinking</hi> above ground.</p>
               <p>In a word, <hi>Sir,</hi> the true <hi>Gentleman</hi> will labour
so to qualify his <hi>soul,</hi> that he may be disposed to doe a
<hi>service</hi> to his <hi>God,</hi> in some proportion answerable to those
se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall <hi>tokens</hi> of <hi>favour</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> whereby he
has so <hi>blest</hi> and grace'd him in the eye of the world: Seeing
<hi>God</hi> has been pleas'd to advance him some degrees above the 
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:42817:139"/> 
                  <hi>Multitude,</hi> he takes care to raise his
<hi>soul</hi> too to that spirituall <hi>hight</hi> and <hi>pitch</hi> of true
<hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Holinesse,</hi> that when thus advanced in
<hi>outward</hi> Dignity, he may not seem a <hi>Dwarfe on Horse-back.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And because the <hi>Common Gifts</hi> of the most <hi>Bountifull
Nature</hi> will not put a man into a Capacity of performing his part to the
full in such an employment, much lesse will <hi>Idlenesse</hi> and
<hi>Negligence:</hi> It should be every <hi>Gentlemans</hi> care in his
<hi>Youth</hi> to give and resigne himselfe wholy up with all his
<hi>pleasures</hi> and <hi>Interests,</hi> to the <hi>Care</hi> of his
<hi>Soul;</hi> that so by the <hi>Prudent Industry</hi> of a <hi>Learned</hi>
and <hi>Godly Instructor,</hi> seconded with his own <hi>Indefatigable
pains</hi> and <hi>patience,</hi> he may have his <hi>Golden parts</hi> made
truly <hi>bright,</hi> and be, as it were, midwised afresh unto such a
<hi>perfection,</hi> that he may not, by the <hi>low</hi> and <hi>beggarly</hi>
condition of a <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>Ignorant Soul,</hi> be a
<hi>Discredit</hi> to his <hi>Lord,</hi> or a <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall</hi> to that

               </p>
               <p>And (blessed be God!) the <hi>Care</hi> of our <hi>Ancestors</hi>
has been such, that we want not <hi>Nurseries</hi> both of <hi>Learning</hi>

they arrive at that <hi>Maturity</hi> both of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>good
