            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>THE</hi> Question <hi>in debate, as it is sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the</hi> Authour <hi>of the</hi> Letter,
<hi>is,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Letter <hi>p.</hi> 1.</note> Whether the Bishops may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and Vote Iudicially in Capital Cases,
which come to be judged in Parlament, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in giving the Iudgment it self, or in
resolving and determining any circumstance
preparatory and leading to that Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
            <p>For our better proceeding towards
a <hi>Resolution</hi> of this <hi>Question,</hi> it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to take notice of some things
granted on both sides, which may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
needless disputes, and be of great
use in the following Debate.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>It is granted,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lett. <hi>p.</hi> 93.</note> That the Bishops do sit in
Parlament by virtue of their Baronies, and
are bound to serve the King there. <hi>And
one part of the</hi> Service <hi>due to the King
there, is</hi> to sit in Iudgment: <hi>for the</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
<hi>of the</hi> Book <hi>entitled,</hi> The Iurisdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the House of Peers asserted, <hi>proves
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62146:4"/>
at large,</hi> that the Right of Iudicature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the Barons in Parlament; <hi>and
that the</hi> Lords Spiritual <hi>have a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
share therein, appears by this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
in the</hi> Title-page <hi>of that</hi> Book, <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
into</hi> English.</p>
            <p>The Iudgment of the Lords Spiritual and
Temporal is according to the Vse and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of Parlament.</p>
            <p>The Vse and Custom of Parlament is
the Law of Parlament.</p>
            <p>The Law of Parlament is the Law of
England.</p>
            <p>The Law of England is the Law of the
Land.</p>
            <p>The Law of the Land is according to
<hi>Magna Charta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore the Iudgment of the Lords
Spiritual and Temporal is according to
<hi>Magna Charta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some <hi>Right</hi> then of <hi>Iudicature</hi> in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament</hi>
the <hi>Bishops</hi> have by <hi>Magna Charta:</hi>
which, whatever it be, is as much theirs
by that <hi>Charter</hi> as any Right of Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Persons; and cannot be invaded or
taken from them without breach of that
<hi>Charter,</hi> any more then the Rights of the
Lords Temporal, or of any other Persons
whatsoever. But how far that Right doth
extend, is now the thing in Question.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:62146:4"/>
2. It is not denied, <hi>that the Bishops
do sit in Parlament by the same kind of
Writs that other Barons do.</hi> They are sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd
to advise and debate about the
great and difficult Affairs of the Kingdom;
<hi>cum Praelatis, Magnatibus &amp; Proceribus
dicti Regni nostri Angliae colloquium ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere
&amp; tractatum;</hi> i. e. to joyn therein
with the Bishops and other Lords of the
Kingdom. So that by the King's <hi>Writ</hi>
of <hi>Summons</hi> they are impower'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
to confer and treat of all the
weighty Affairs that shall be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them. And no Instance is so much
as offer'd to be produced of any <hi>Writ</hi>
wherein the King doth limit and restrain
the Bishops, any more then any other
Lords of Parlament, as to any matter of
Consultation, or Point of Judicature,
belonging to that House. They have
then by their <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Summons</hi> as good
right to sit in all Cases, as in any: and
since the other Lords by <hi>their Writs</hi> are
summoned to advise with the Prelates in
<hi>all</hi> matters that shall come before them,
without limitation, it is not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
how this can be done, if the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
in some of the most important De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
be excluded.</p>
            <p>3. It is yielded,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lett.</hi> p. 3. 118.</note> That if the House pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62146:5"/>
in a <hi>Legislative way</hi> by passing <hi>Bills
of Attainder,</hi> the Bishops have a Right to
sit and Vote therein as well as other Lords:
at these it is said, <hi>that the Bishops are or
should be all present at the passing of them,
for then they act as Members of the House
of Lords in their Legislative capacity.</hi> But
men do as certainly die that are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the <hi>Legislative,</hi> as in the <hi>Iudicial</hi>
Way. Is not this then really as much a
<hi>Case of Bloud</hi> as the other? If the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
should give their Votes in the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative</hi>
way to condemn a Person for
Treason, and yet think they had not Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in a <hi>Case of Bloud;</hi> they would then
indeed be like <hi>Chaucer</hi>'s Frier, mention'd
by the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter,</hi> that would
have <hi>of a Capon the Liver,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lett. <hi>p.</hi> 66.</note> 
               <hi>and of a Pig
the Head, yet would that nothing for him
should be dead.</hi> Doth a <hi>Bill</hi> of <hi>Attainder</hi>
cut of a man's Head without making it a
<hi>Case</hi> of <hi>Bloud?</hi> There can be then no
objection now made against the <hi>Bishops
Right</hi> from any <hi>Canons</hi> of the Church;
for those allow no such distinction of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
in the <hi>Legislative,</hi> or <hi>Iudicial</hi>
Way.<note place="margin">P. 21.</note> And the late <hi>Authour</hi> of <hi>the Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Iurisdiction of the Lords Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi>
doth grant, <hi>that the Canons do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
the Bishops voting in Bills of Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62146:5"/>
as much as in any Case whatsoever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we are not to suppose a Person of
such abilities as the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter,</hi>
would go about to exclude the <hi>Bishops</hi>
from their <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Voting</hi> in a <hi>Iudicial
way in Cases Capital,</hi> unless there were
some great appearance of <hi>Law</hi> on his side;
because he professes so <hi>great a Desire that
Right may prevail;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lett.</hi> p. 2, 3.</note> and <hi>that his design in
writing was, to satisfy himself and others
where that Right is.</hi> The discovery where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is our present business. Yet before
the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi> comes to a close
debate of the matter of <hi>Right,</hi> he lets fall
some general <hi>Insinuations</hi> to create a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice</hi>
in the Reader's mind, as to the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
meddling at all in Secular Affairs,</hi> as
though it were inconsistent with their
<hi>Function,</hi> and with some passages in the
<hi>Imperial</hi> Law. And because men may
sometimes doe more harm by what they
tell us <hi>they will not say,</hi> then by what they
<hi>do say;</hi> it will be fit to prevent the danger
of such <hi>Insinuations,</hi> before we come to
consider his <hi>Arguments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The <hi>first</hi> is,<note place="margin">Lett. <hi>p.</hi> 5.</note> 
               <hi>that meddling at all in
Secular Affairs seems to be the doing that
which the Apostles declared they would not
doe,</hi> viz. <hi>leave the Word of God, and serve
Tables.</hi> But are all Persons of Estates now
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62146:6"/>
bound to part with them, as the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
then did? <hi>The serving of Tables</hi> was
a full employment; and they who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
that Office were the Treasurers of
the Church, to distribute to every one
as they judged fit, out of the common
Stock. Is it <hi>no Service to God,</hi> to doe Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and to shew Mercy? to attend upon
the publick Affairs of the Kingdom, when
they are called to it by their Sovereign?
Or are all <hi>Bishops</hi> now in the same cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
the <hi>Apostles</hi> were when the
Christian Church was to be planted in
the World, and so few persons as the
12 Apostles made choice of for that
Work? Is there no difference to be made
between a Church constituted and settled
and incorporated into the Commonwealth,
and one not yet formed, but labouring
under great difficulties, and making its
way through constant persecutions?
May it not be as well argued, that <hi>Bishops</hi>
are not to stay in one Countrey, nor to
have any fixed habitation, because the
<hi>Apostles</hi> passed from place to place prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the Word of God? Doth not the
<hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi> himself confesse,
<hi>that the Clergy are one of the Three Estates
of the Kingdom?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lett. <hi>p.</hi> 86.</note> and by the <hi>Act 8 Eliz.</hi> 1.
the <hi>Clergy</hi> are called <hi>one of the greatest
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62146:6"/>
States of this Realm.</hi> And is there not
then great Reason, that those who are <hi>the
chief part of it,</hi> as he confesseth the <hi>Bishops</hi>
to be, should have a share in affairs that
concern the whole Nation? And would
it not seem strange to the Christian
World, that <hi>we</hi> alone of all the <hi>Kingdoms</hi>
of <hi>Europe</hi> should exclude the <hi>Bishops</hi> from
having an equal Interest with the other
Estates in Parlament? For it were easy
to prove from unquestionable Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
that as soon as the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
was well settled in any of these <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Kingdoms,</hi> the Bishops were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into all the publick Councils:
and have so continued to this day, where
the Convention of the Estates hath been
kept up; <hi>Bohemia</hi> onely excepted since
the days of <hi>Sigismond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I begin with <hi>France,</hi> where <hi>Hincmarus</hi>

               <hi>there were two great Councils every
year: one of the States of the Kingdom, for
ordering the Affairs of the ensuing year, and
redressing of Grievances; and in these the
Bishops were always present: and the other
of the King's Council, which managed the
intervening Affairs; and into this the
chief of the Bishops were chosen.</hi> It were
endless to repeat the several Parlaments
in <hi>France</hi> in the time of the <hi>Merovin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:62146:7"/>
and <hi>Caroline</hi> Race, wherein Laws
were passed, and the great Affairs of the
Kingdom managed by the <hi>Bishops, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen,</hi>
and others. Those who have
looked into the ancient <hi>Annals</hi> and <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulars</hi>
of <hi>France,</hi> cannot be ignorant of
this. There is one thing remarkable to
our purpose in the famous Council of
<hi>Frankford,</hi> which opposed the Worship of
Images so stoutly, <hi>viz.</hi> that after the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion were agreed, then, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Custom of that Age, the
other Estates being present, they procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to other matters: and then <hi>Tassilo</hi>
Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> was brought upon his
Knees for Treason; and the Cause of
<hi>Peter</hi> Bishop of <hi>Verdun</hi> was heard, who
was likewise accused of Treason, and
there purged himself. Concerning both
which Cases there are 2 <hi>Canons</hi> still ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
among the <hi>Canons</hi> of that Council:<note place="margin">Concil. Franc. <hi>c. 3. &amp;</hi> 9.</note>
and in <hi>another,</hi> the Bishops are appointed,
by consent of the King, to doe Justice in
their several Dioceses. And that they
had not onely a share in the <hi>Legislative,</hi>
but in the <hi>Iudiciary part,</hi> appears by one
of the ancient <hi>Formulae</hi> in <hi>Marculphus,</hi>

The like might be proved <hi>here</hi> in the
<hi>Saxon</hi> times, from the Conversion of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelbert</hi>
downward. This is so very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that he must blind his eyes that
doth not see it, if he doth but cast them
on the History of those times.</p>
            <p>These things I have laid together with
all possible brevity and clearness, that in
one view we may see a consent of all these
parts of the Christian World, in calling
<hi>Bishops</hi> to their <hi>publick Councils,</hi> and most
solemn Debates; and how far they were
from thinking such Imployments incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with their Sacred Function, and
charging them, that thereby <hi>they left the
Word of God to serve Tables.</hi> Neither can
this be looked on as any part of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy
of the Church, or the <hi>Policy</hi>
of the <hi>Papacy;</hi> since, as the fore-cited
<hi>Arumaeus</hi> saith, <hi>they were admitted to this
honour before the Papal Power was advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced;
and were so far from carrying on the
Pope's designs, that they were, in most
Countries, the greatest Opposers of them.</hi>
And when the <hi>Popes</hi> began to set up
their Monarchy, their business was, to draw
them off from meeting in these Councils,
under several pretences of <hi>Cases of Bloud,</hi>
and other things; the better to keep
them in a sole Dependency on themselves.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62146:9"/>
As will appear by the following Discourse.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The next thing suggested is, that</hi>
the Imperial Law doth forbid Clergy-men
having any thing to doe with Secular mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.<note place="margin">Lett. <hi>p.</hi> 3, 4.</note>
               <hi>And for this a</hi> Rescript <hi>of</hi> Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
<hi>and</hi> Theodosius <hi>is mentioned, and a</hi>
Decree <hi>of</hi> Iustinian. <hi>To which I answer,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Imperial Edicts</hi> are not the Law
of <hi>England.</hi> Our dispute is about a Right
by our own Laws; which a <hi>Rescript</hi> of
<hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>Theodosius</hi> can neither give
nor take away. What would become of
the whole frame of our Government,
and of our just Rights and Properties, if
the producing of Imperial Edicts would
be sufficient to overthrow them? When
the Bishops once pleaded hard in Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in behalf of an <hi>Imperial</hi> Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
lately adopted into the <hi>Canon-Law,</hi>
the Answer given by all the Temporal
Lords was,<note place="margin">Stat. Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton <hi>c. 9. 20 H.</hi> 3.</note> 
               <hi>Nolumus leges Angliae mutare,
quae huc usque usitatae sunt &amp; approbatae.</hi>
They did not mean, they would make
no alterations in Parlament, for that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Parlament did so in several things:
but their meaning was,<note place="margin">Dissert. ad Flet. c. 9. § 2.</note> as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,
that they owned neither <hi>Canon</hi>
nor <hi>Imperial</hi> Laws here, any farther then
they were agreeable to the Laws of the
Land.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:62146:10"/>
2. The <hi>Imperial</hi> Constitutions do give
liberty to Church-men to have to doe in
Secular Affairs. The Emperour <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi>
whose Constitutions deserve as
great regard as those of <hi>Honorius</hi> and
<hi>Theodosius,</hi> to shew his respect to the
Christian Religion, permitted all men to
bring their Causes before the Bishops,
without ever going to the other Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Soz.</hi> hist. l. 1. c. 9.</note>
as <hi>Sozomen,</hi> a Lawyer of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
relates. And this is the true foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the Constitution <hi>De Episcopali
Iudicio;</hi> as <hi>Gothofred</hi> confesseth. Which
is at large inserted into the <hi>Capitulars,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Capitul. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol.</hi> &amp; <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dov.</hi> l. 6. c. 281. ed. Lindenb. c. 366. ed. Baluz.</note>
with a more then usual introduction;
and made a Law to all the Subjects of the
Empire, <hi>Franks, Saxons, Lombards, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,
&amp;c.</hi> and therefore is more conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to these parts then a bare Rescript
of <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>Theodosius.</hi> And yet,
these very Emperours,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cod. Just.</hi> de Epise. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient. l. 1. tit. 4. c. 8.</note> in a <hi>Constitution</hi> of
theirs, do so far ratifie the Judgment of
Bishops upon Trial by consent before
them, that no Appeal doth lie from their
Decree. What Rescript then is this of
theirs which so utterly forbids Clegy-men
having any thing to doe with publick
Functions, or things appertaining to the
Court? I suppose that Constitution of
<hi>Honorius</hi> is meant, which confines the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62146:10"/>
Bishops Power to what concerns Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
and leaves other Causes to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Judges and the Course of Law.
But two things are well observed by <hi>Iac.
Gothofred</hi> concerning this <hi>Rescript</hi> of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cod. Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos.</hi> l. 16. tit. 11. c. 1.</note>
1. that it is meant of absolute
and peremptory Judgment without Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal;
2. that whatever is meant by it,
not many years after, this <hi>Constitution</hi>
was repealed by <hi>Honorius</hi> himself, and
the Bishops sentence made as absolute as
before. So that <hi>Honorius</hi> is clearly against
him, if a man's second judgment and
thoughts be better.</p>
            <p>3. The practice of the best men in those
Ages shews, that they thought no Law
in force to forbid Church-men to meddle
in Secular Affairs: as might be at large
proved from the practice of <hi>Gregory Thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maturgus</hi>
and S. <hi>Basil</hi> in the <hi>East;</hi>

if there had been a Law in force to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
Bishops meddling in Secular Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
            <p>4. The Emperours still reserved to
themselves the power of dispensing with
their own <hi>Rescripts,</hi> and the <hi>Canons</hi> of the
Church.<note place="margin">Concil. Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> Therefore the Council of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dica,</hi>

yet if the Emperour commands, the Bishops
are bound to obey, and to doe what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands

places he asserts the Emperour's power
of dispensing with the strictest <hi>Canons</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

the Bishops are summon'd by the <hi>King</hi>'s
<hi>Writ</hi> to serve him in the publick Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil

            <p>I find one thing more suggested by way

the <hi>Common Law</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lett. <hi>p.</hi> 4.</note> which

I now come to debate more
closely the main Point. For the <hi>Authour</hi>

two ways: 1. by Statute-Law; 2. by Use

            <p>I. For Statute-Law; two Ratificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he saith, there have been of it in

            <p>1. The <hi>Constitutions of Clarendon;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lett. <hi>p.</hi> 69.</note>
which he looks on as the more considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
because <hi>they were not the enacting of

new Laws, but a declaration of what was
before.</hi> And for the same Reason I value
them too, and shall be content this Cause
stand or fall by them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Constitution <hi>in debate is the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>,
which is thus repeated and translated in
the</hi> Letter. Archiepiscopi, Episcopi, &amp;

            </p>
            <p>The Archbishops, Bishops, and all the
dignified Clergy of the Land that hold of
the King <hi>in Capite,</hi> shall hold their possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

till it come to require either losse of Member
or Life.</p>
            <p>The Argument from hence he enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
from the solemn <hi>Recognition</hi> and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
confirmation of these <hi>Constitutions,</hi>

and the <hi>Oath</hi> taken to observe them;
from whence he concludes this to be <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonium
irrefragabile, An irrefragable
and invincible Testimony.</hi> And so I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see
it will prove, but to a quite contrary
purpose from what he intended it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The whole</hi> Question <hi>depends upon the
meaning of the latter</hi> Clause <hi>of this</hi> Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.
<hi>The meaning he gives of it is
this,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lett. <hi>p.</hi> 61.</note> 
               <hi>that</hi> the Prelats of the Church should
not be present at the Iudgments given in
the King's Courts when losse of Member or
Life was in question.</p>
            <p>The meaning of it I conceive to be
this, that the Bishops are required to be
present in the King's Courts as other Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons
are, till they come to give Sentence
as to Dismembring, or loss of Life.</p>
            <p>Whether of these is the true meaning
is now to be considered: and that will
best be discovered these three ways. 1. By
the Occasion. 2. By the plain Sense of
the words according to their true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
3. By the subsequent Practice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this <hi>Constitution</hi> in the Parlament at
<hi>Northampton</hi> soon after.</p>
            <p>1. By the <hi>Occasion.</hi> The <hi>Authour</hi> of
the <hi>Letter</hi> assigns that Occasion for this
Constitution, for which there is not the
least colour; <hi>viz. That the Prelats of that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62146:13"/>
time</hi> were ambitious <hi>of a kind of</hi> Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,<note place="margin">Lett. <hi>p.</hi> 73.</note>
               <hi>(in</hi> Judicature <hi>I suppose he means,)
and that to restrain their power of</hi> Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
Capital Cases <hi>this</hi> Constitution <hi>was
made: and because this seemed to be</hi> a
diminution <hi>of their Power, therefore</hi>
Matt. Paris <hi>ranks it among the</hi> Consuetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines
iniquas, the wicked Customs <hi>of the
former times.</hi> For all which there is not
the least shadow of Proof; besides that
it is so repugnant to the History of those
Times, that I can hardly believe a Person
of so much Learning and Judgment, as is
commonly said to be the <hi>Authour</hi> of the
<hi>Letter,</hi> could betray so much unskilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the Affairs of those Times. For
this is so far from being true, that the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
did then affect such a <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
in all Secular Causes,</hi> that they looked
on their attendance in the <hi>King's Court</hi> in
the <hi>Trial</hi> of <hi>Causes,</hi> as a burthen which
they would fain have been rid of; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they accounted it a <hi>Mark of Subjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to the Civil Power, and contrary to
that <hi>Ecclesiastical Liberty,</hi> or Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
on Princes, which from the days
of <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. they had been endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to set up. Which <hi>H.</hi> II. being very
sensible of, resolved to tie them to the
<hi>Service</hi> of their <hi>Baronies,</hi> and to an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62146:14"/>
on the <hi>King's Courts</hi> together with
<hi>other Barons.</hi> But lest they should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
any force on their Consciences, as
to the <hi>Canons</hi> of the Church, this <hi>Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi>
doth not require, but suffers them
to withdraw, <hi>when they came to Sentence
in matters of Bloud.</hi> And that this was
the true Occasion, I prove by these two
invincible Arguments.</p>
            <p>1. By the complaint which they made
of the <hi>Baronies,</hi> as too great <hi>a mark of
Subjection</hi> to the Civil Power. This is
plain from <hi>Matt.Paris</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. Paris <hi>ad A. D.</hi> 1070.</note> himself, to whom
the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi> refers: for when
he speaks of <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conquerour's</hi> brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the <hi>Temporalties</hi> of the <hi>Bishops</hi> into
the condition of <hi>Baronies, i. e.</hi> forcing
them to hold them of him <hi>in Chief</hi> upon
certain <hi>Duties</hi> and <hi>Services,</hi> he calls it
<hi>Constitutionem pessimam, a most wicked
Constitution;</hi> just as he calls the <hi>Customs</hi>
of <hi>Clarendon Consuetudines iniquas, wicked
Customs.</hi> And he adds, that many were
banished rather then they would submit
to that <hi>Constitution.</hi> For their Privileges
were so great with the <hi>Frank-almoign</hi> they
enjoy'd in the <hi>Saxon</hi> times, and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
so hearty (especially among the
<hi>Monks,</hi> who from <hi>Edgar</hi>'s time had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
into most <hi>Cathedral</hi> Churches) to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62146:14"/>
the <hi>Papal Monarchy,</hi> that they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
chose to quit all, then to give up
the <hi>Cause</hi> of the <hi>Churche's Liberty</hi> by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
of <hi>Baronies.</hi> Therefore <hi>Matt.
Paris</hi> calls the <hi>Rolls</hi> that were made of
the <hi>Services</hi> belonging to these <hi>Baronies,
Rotulas Ecclesiasticae Servitutis,</hi> the <hi>Rolls
of Ecclesiastical Slavery;</hi> then which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could be more contrary to that <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Liberty</hi> which was then setting
up by Pope <hi>Hildebrand.</hi> And to put
this out of all dispute, <hi>Petrus Blesensis,</hi> a
<hi>Name</hi> well known in this dispute, in that
very <hi>Book</hi> where he complains of the
<hi>Bishops Hypocrisy</hi> about <hi>Cases of Bloud,</hi> in
being present at hearing and trying Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
but going out at Sentence, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
likewise of their <hi>Baronies,</hi> as those
which gave occasion to that Hypocrisy,
and as <hi>the marks of the vilest Slavery.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pet. Bles.</hi> de Institut. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisc. p. 451.</note>

Now <hi>Pet. Blesensis</hi> lived in the time of
<hi>H.</hi> II. and knew the whole proceedings
of the <hi>Constitutions of Clarendon,</hi> and was
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62146:15"/>
a zealous maintainer of <hi>Becket</hi>'s Cause, or,
which was all one, of <hi>the Liberties of the
Church,</hi> as they call'd them, against the
<hi>Civil Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. By the fierce Contest between the
<hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Power, about the
<hi>Liberties</hi> of <hi>Church-men.</hi> This was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on from the time that <hi>William</hi> I.
brought them into Subjection by their
<hi>Baronies:</hi> his <hi>Sons</hi> stood upon the <hi>Rights</hi>
of the <hi>Crown;</hi> whilst <hi>Anselm</hi> and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
struggled all they could, but to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
purpose, till after the death of <hi>H.</hi> I.
Then <hi>Stephen,</hi> to gratifie the great <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,</hi>
by whose favour he came to the
Crown, yielded all they desired: but he
soon repented, and they were even with
him for it. <hi>Malmsbury</hi> takes particular
notice, that he yielded they should have
their Possessions <hi>free</hi> and <hi>absolute;</hi>

they promised onely a <hi>conditional Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance</hi>
to him, as long as he maintained
the <hi>Liberties of the Church.</hi> When K. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi>
broke the <hi>Canons,</hi> as they said, by
imprisoning 2 Bishops, the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi>
and his <hi>Brethren</hi> summon'd him to
answer it before them in <hi>Council;</hi> and
there declared, that the King had nothing
to doe with Church-men, till the <hi>Cause</hi>
was first heard and determined by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62146:15"/>
All his time, they had no regard
to his Authority, when it contradicted
their Wills: and when the Peace was
made between <hi>Him</hi> and <hi>H.</hi> II. <hi>Radul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus

of the Clergy increased by it.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rad. de Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceto</hi> Imag. histor. p. 509. 528.</note> In this

saith, <hi>the great business of the
Church-men was to preserve their Liberties.</hi>
Upon this the great Quarrel between <hi>Him</hi>
and <hi>Becket</hi> began: this made the <hi>King</hi>
search what the <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>Crown</hi> were
which his <hi>Ancestours</hi> challenged; to these
he was resolved to make <hi>Becket</hi> and his
<hi>Brethren</hi> submit. For this purpose the
<hi>Parlament</hi> was called at <hi>Clarendon,</hi> and
after great debates the 16 <hi>Constitutions</hi>
were produced; which were those the King
was resolved to maintain, and he made
the <hi>Bishops</hi> as well as others swear to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
them. Now when the rest of them
relate to some <hi>Exemptions</hi> and <hi>Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>

saith, All the <hi>Constitutions</hi> of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendon</hi>
were for <hi>suppressing the Liberty of

say, considering this,) is there not then
great Reason to understand this 11<hi rend="sup">th.</hi>
               <hi>Constitution</hi> after the same manner: <hi>viz.</hi>
that notwithstanding K. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Grant,
<hi>H. II.</hi> would make them hold by <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi>
and doe all the <hi>Service</hi> of <hi>Barons</hi> in
the <hi>King's Courts,</hi> as other <hi>Barons</hi> did;
and he would allow them no other <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege,</hi>
but that of <hi>withdrawing when they
came to Sentence in a Case of Bloud?</hi> What
is there in this sense, but what is easy and
natural, and fully agreeable to the state
of those Times? whereas there is not the
least foundation for the pretence of the
<hi>Bishops</hi> affecting to be present in all Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
which the <hi>King</hi> must restrain by this
<hi>Constitution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This sense of it is not onely without
ground, but is absolutely repugnant to
all the <hi>History</hi> of that <hi>Age.</hi> For if this
<hi>Constitution</hi> was intended to <hi>restrain</hi> the
<hi>Bishops</hi> from trying <hi>Causes of Bloud,</hi> then
the <hi>Bishops</hi> did desire to be present in those
<hi>Causes,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> would not suffer
them. Whereas it is evident that the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
pretended scruple of Conscience from
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62146:16"/>
the <hi>Canons,</hi> that they could not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
but in truth stood upon their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption
from the <hi>Service</hi> of <hi>Barons,</hi>
which they call'd <hi>Ecclesiastical Slavery.</hi>
And therefore that could not be the sense
of the <hi>Constitution,</hi> to restrain them in that
which they desired to be freed from, and
which by this <hi>Constitution</hi> of <hi>Clarendon</hi>
was plainly forced upon them against
their wills. For <hi>Lanfranc</hi> had brought
the <hi>Canon</hi> of the 11<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 
               <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Toledo</hi>
into <hi>England,</hi>

                  <hi>Spelm.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. To. 2. p. 8, 9, 11.</note> 
               <hi>That no Bishop or Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
should condemn a man to death, or
give vote in the Sentence of Condemnation:</hi>
at which <hi>Council</hi> were present 2 <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops,</hi>
12 <hi>Bishops,</hi> and 21 <hi>Abbots.</hi> And
before <hi>H.</hi> II'<hi rend="sup">s</hi> time this <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Toledo</hi>
was received into the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Canon-Law,</hi>
made by <hi>Ivo, Burchardus, Regino,</hi> and
<hi>Gratian</hi> who lived in the time of K. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen:</hi>
and when they saw such a <hi>Canon</hi>
so generally received, is there not far
greater Reason to think they desired to
withdraw, then that they should press
to be present, and the King restrain them?
But the <hi>Constitution</hi> is so framed on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
to let them understand, that the
<hi>King</hi> expected in all <hi>Iudgments</hi> they
should doe their <hi>Duty,</hi> as other <hi>Barons:</hi>
but lest they should think he purposely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62146:17"/>
to make them break the <hi>Canons,</hi>
he leaves them at <hi>liberty to withdraw</hi> when
<hi>Sentence</hi> was to be given. So that I can
hardly doubt but the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
if he please calmly to reflect upon
the whole matter, will see reason to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
his mistake; and that this
<hi>Constitution</hi> was so far from intending to
restrain the <hi>Bishops</hi> from all <hi>Iudicature</hi> in
<hi>Cases of Bloud,</hi> that, on the contrary, it
was purposely framed to oblige them to
be present, and to act in such Causes as
the <hi>other Barons</hi> did, at least till the Cause
was ripe for Sentence: which last Point
the King was content to yield to them,
out of regard and reverence to the <hi>Canons</hi>
of the <hi>Church.</hi> For the words of the
<hi>Law</hi> are not words of <hi>Prohibition</hi> and
<hi>restraint</hi> from any thing, but of <hi>Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to a <hi>Duty;</hi> which was, <hi>to be present</hi>
and <hi>serve</hi> in the <hi>King's Courts of Iudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
in like manner as the other Barons
did.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From all which it is evident, I think,
beyond contradiction, that the <hi>Occasion</hi>
of this <hi>Law</hi> was not <hi>the</hi> Ambition <hi>of the
Prelates,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 73.</note> (as the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi>
suggests) <hi>to thrust themselves into this
kind of Iudicature;</hi> but an <hi>Ambition</hi> of
a worse kind, (though quite contrary)
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62146:17"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> under a pretence of <hi>Ecclesiastical Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi>
and <hi>Privilege,</hi> to exempt themselves
from the <hi>Service</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
to which by virtue of their <hi>Baronies</hi>
they were bound, <hi>sicut caeteri Barones, as
well as the other Barons.</hi> And therefore
it is so far from being true, that the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
exercise of this <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> together
with the <hi>Temporal</hi> Lords is a <hi>Relique</hi> of
<hi>Popery,</hi> and one of the <hi>Encroachments</hi> of
the <hi>Clergy</hi> in those <hi>Times</hi> of <hi>Ignorance</hi> and
<hi>Usurpation,</hi> as some well-meaning <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
are now made to believe; that, on
the contrary, the <hi>Exemption</hi> of the <hi>Clergy</hi>
from this kind of <hi>Secular Iudicature</hi> was
one of the <hi>highest Points</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> and
that which the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Adherents</hi>
contested for with more zeal then for any
<hi>Article</hi> of the <hi>Creed.</hi> This was one of
those <hi>Privileges</hi> which <hi>Thomas Becket</hi>
said <hi>Christ purchased for his Church with his
bloud,</hi> and in the obstinate defence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
against the King he himself at last lost
his life. And now to put the matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all doubt, I appeal to any man
skill'd in the <hi>History</hi> of those <hi>Times,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Thomas Becket</hi> opposed the <hi>Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions</hi>
of <hi>Clarendon</hi> to the death, and
broke the <hi>Oath</hi> he had taken to observe
them, because by them (among other
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62146:18"/>
things) the <hi>Bishops</hi> were <hi>excluded</hi> from
<hi>Iudicature</hi> in <hi>Cases of Bloud;</hi> or for the
quite contrary reason, (among others)
because this <hi>Service</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> in <hi>his
Courts,</hi> impos'd on them by virtue of
their <hi>Baronies,</hi> was look'd upon by him
as a violation of the <hi>Privileges</hi> of the
<hi>Church,</hi> and a <hi>badge</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiastical Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
which by all means he desir'd to cast
off. And if the latter be the true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
I leave it to the impartial <hi>Reader,</hi>
and even to the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi>
himself upon second thoughts, whether
he have not widely mistaken both the
<hi>Occasion</hi> and <hi>Meaning</hi> of this Law.</p>
            <p>2. Let us consider the plain <hi>Sense</hi> of
the <hi>words</hi> according to the <hi>true reading</hi>
of them. The <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi> hath
made use of the most imperfect <hi>Copy, viz.</hi>
that in <hi>Matt. Paris;</hi> I cannot tell for
what reason, unless it be that in the <hi>last
Clause [in Iudicio]</hi> is there left out,
which is put in in the <hi>Copy</hi> extant in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vase,</hi>
and in the <hi>Vatican</hi> Copy, and in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>MSS.</hi> in all which it runs thus, <hi>Et
sicut Barones caeteri debent interesse judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is
Curiae Regis cum Baronibus, usque <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniatur
in judicio</hi> ad diminutionem mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brorum,
vel ad mortem.</hi> Now here are
two things to be distinguished.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:62146:18"/>
1. Something expresly required of the
<hi>Bishops</hi> as to their <hi>presence in the King's
Courts, viz.</hi> that <hi>they must attend as other Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,</hi>
and sit together with them: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is expressed twice; <hi>Et sicut caeteri Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rones,</hi>
in the beginning of that Clause, and
<hi>cum Baronibus,</hi> again after, and <hi>debent inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esse,</hi>
in the middle. And can any one soberly
think, that the meaning of all this is, they
must not be present in cases of Bloud?
No: the <hi>Constitution</hi> saith, <hi>they ought to
be present as other Barons,</hi> and sit <hi>with</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Barons</hi> in the <hi>Trials of the King's
Courts.</hi> And yet the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
doth (to speak mildly) very unfairly
represent this <hi>Constitution,</hi> as if it did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
the <hi>Prelats</hi> to be at all <hi>present in the
Iudgments of the King's Courts in Cases of
Bloud;</hi> and that in express words. For,
speaking of the <hi>Constitutions</hi> of <hi>Clarendon,</hi>
he hath this passage,<note place="margin">pag. 61.</note> 
               <hi>And one of these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
was, that the Prelats of the
Church <hi>should not interesse Iudiciis Curie
Regis, be present at the Iudgments gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in the Kings Courts.</hi>
               </hi> Whereas
this <hi>Constitution</hi> (as he himself cites it
afterwards) runs thus, <hi>debent interesse</hi>
Iudiciis Curie Regis, quousque, &amp;c.
<hi>they ought to be present in the Iudgments
of the King's Courts, till it come to loss of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62146:19"/>
Members or Life.</hi> So that this <hi>Law</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
says, that <hi>they ought to be present in
the Iudgments of the King's Courts, <hi>till it
come, &amp;c.</hi>
               </hi> And when <hi>it comes to loss
of Members or Life,</hi> it doth not say (as
the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi> affirms) that
<hi>they should not be present</hi> then, nor do the
words of the <hi>Constitution</hi> imply any such
thing; but only require (as I shall evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
make appear) their presence so
far; and when it should come to <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,</hi>
leaves them at liberty to withdraw
in obedience to the <hi>Canons</hi> of the Church,
which they pretended themselves bound
in Conscience to observe. And this is
the true Reason why, among the 16 <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions</hi>
of <hi>Clarendon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Baronius</hi> ad Ann. 1164.</note> (whereof 10 were
<hi>condemned, 6 tolerated,</hi> but <hi>none approv'd,</hi>
by <hi>Pope Alex. III.)</hi> this 11. was one of
the 6 which escaped with an <hi>Hoc tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit,
this</hi> the Pope <hi>was content to tolerate;</hi>
because in the last <hi>Clause</hi> of it there was
regard had to the <hi>Canons</hi> of the Church.
Of this misrepresentation of the <hi>Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
under debate, though it might have
deserved a more severe animadversion, I
shall say no more, because I have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to provoke the <hi>Authour</hi> or any body
else, but onely to convince them.</p>
            <p>2. Something allowed to the <hi>Bishops</hi> as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62146:19"/>
peculiar to themselves, <hi>viz.</hi> That when
the <hi>Court</hi> hath proceeded so far <hi>in judicio,</hi>
in a particular Trial, (for before it is <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciis</hi>
in general) that Sentence was to
be given either as to dismembring, or
loss of life, then they are at liberty; but
till then they are required. As, suppose
<hi>Charles</hi> V. had required the <hi>Protestant
Princes</hi> to attend him to <hi>Masse,</hi> as
<hi>other Princes</hi> did; onely when the <hi>Mass-Bell</hi>
tinckled they might withdraw;
would not any reasonable man understand
by this, that they were obliged to their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
till then? So it is here: the <hi>King</hi>
commands their Attendance till it comes
to such a point; therefore before it comes
thither, their presence is plainly required
by this <hi>Constitution.</hi> And so in stead of
there being a <hi>Statute-Law</hi> to exclude the
<hi>Bishops</hi> at such <hi>Trials,</hi> there is one to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
their presence <hi>in judicio,</hi> in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of such a <hi>Trial,</hi> till it comes to
Sentence. All that can be said in this
case is, <hi>that the last Clause is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of the Sentence, but of the Kind
or quality of the Cause; i. e. they are to be
present in the King's Courts, till they come
to a Cause wherein a man's Life or Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
are concerned.</hi> But that this cannot
be the meaning will appear.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:62146:20"/>
1. There is a great deal of difference
between <hi>quousque perveniatur ad judicium
mutilationis membrorum, vel mortis,</hi> that
might have been understood of a <hi>Cause of
Bloud;</hi> and <hi>quousque perveniatur in judicio
ad mutilationem membrorum, vel ad mortem,</hi>
for this supposeth a Trial already begun,
and the Bishops present so far in it; but
when it comes to the point of <hi>mutilation</hi>
or <hi>death,</hi> then they have leave to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw.
So that this last <hi>Clause</hi> must either
be understood of <hi>Execution,</hi> which no one
can think proper for the <hi>King's Courts;</hi>
or for the <hi>Sentence</hi> given by the <hi>Court,</hi>
which is most agreeable.</p>
            <p>2. The Sense is best understood by the
Practice of that <hi>Age.</hi> For, if the meaning
of the <hi>Constitution</hi> had been, they must
not be present in any <hi>Cause of Bloud,</hi> and
the <hi>Bishops</hi> had all sworn to observe it;
can we imagine we should find them prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tising
the contrary so soon after? And
for this I appeal to <hi>Petrus Blesensis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pet. Bles.</hi> de Instit. Episc. p. 454.</note> whose
words are so material to this purpose, that
I shall set them down. <hi>Principes Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotum
&amp; Seniores Populi, licèt non dictent
judicia sanguinis, eadem tamen tractant
disputando &amp; disceptando de illis; séque
ideo immunes à culpa reputant, quòd mortis
aut truncationis membrorum judícium decer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentes,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62146:20"/>
à pronuntiatione duntaxat &amp; exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutione
poenalis sententiae se absentent.</hi>
Whereby it is evident that the <hi>Bishops</hi>
were present at all Debates, and gave
<hi>Votes in Causes of Bloud;</hi> but they absen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
themselves from the <hi>Sentence,</hi> and the
<hi>Execution</hi> of it. It is true, <hi>Pet. Blesensis</hi>
finds fault with them for this. But what
is that to the <hi>Law,</hi> or to the practice of
that Age? I do not question, but <hi>Pet.
Blesensis</hi> condemned the observation of
the other <hi>Constitutions</hi> of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> as well
as this; and in all probability this passage
of his was levelled at those <hi>Bishops</hi> who
did observe this 11. <hi>Constitution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. We have a plain way to understand
the <hi>meaning</hi> of this <hi>Constitution,</hi> by what
happen'd soon after in the <hi>Parlament</hi> at
<hi>Northampton,</hi> which was summon'd upon
<hi>Becket</hi>'s Obstinacy and Contempt of the
<hi>King</hi>'s Authority: where <hi>Fitz-stephen</hi>
saith, <hi>he was accused of Treason; and the
Bishops sate together with other Barons;</hi>
and because it did not come to a sentence
of Death, after great debate between
the other <hi>Lords</hi> and the <hi>Bishops</hi> about pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
the Sentence, the <hi>Bishop</hi> of
<hi>Winchester</hi> did it. Wherein we have as
plain evidence as can be desired, that the
<hi>Bishops</hi> did sit with the <hi>other Barons,</hi> and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62146:21"/>
               <hi>vote</hi> with them in a <hi>case of Treason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this <hi>Precedent</hi> the <hi>Authour</hi> of the
<hi>Letter</hi> answers several things.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>That</hi> none of the ancient Historians
of those Times say any thing of his being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
of Treason:<note place="margin">Lett. <hi>p.</hi> 60.</note> 
               <hi>and therefore he</hi> thinks
one may modestly affirm,<note place="margin">pag. 62.</note> that it was a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<hi>in</hi> Fitz-stephen <hi>to say so. But what
if H.</hi> II. <hi>and</hi> Becket <hi>himself both confess
that he was charged with</hi> Treason?<note place="margin">Vol. Epistol. <hi>Becket</hi> in Bibl. Cotton. MS. l. 1. ep. 65.</note> 
               <hi>H.</hi> II.
<hi>in his</hi> Letter <hi>to</hi> Reginaldus <hi>saith, that</hi> by
consent of his Barons and Clergy he had
sent Ambassadours to Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi>
with this Charge, that if he did not free
him from that Traitour <hi>Becket,</hi> he and his
Kingdom would renounce all Obedience to
him. <hi>And</hi> Becket <hi>did not think this a
bare term of reproach; for in one of his</hi>
Letters <hi>he saith, that defending the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of the Church</hi> laesae Majestatis rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
sub persecutore nostro est,<note place="margin">Ep. 52.</note> 
               <hi>was</hi> looked on
as Treason <hi>by the King.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gervas.</hi> Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic. p. 1391.</note> 
               <hi>And even</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vase
<hi>himself, to whom the</hi> Authour <hi>of the</hi>
Letter <hi>appeals, saith,</hi> some of his friends
came to him at <hi>Northampton,</hi> and told
him, if he did not submit to the King, he
would be proceeded against as a Traitour,
for breaking the Allegeance he had promised
to the King, when he did swear to observe
the ancient Customs at <hi>Clarendon. And</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:62146:21"/>
Fitz-stephen <hi>saith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fitz-stephen</hi> Vit. Th. Bec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket. de Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilio apud Clarendon.</note> the King's Council at
<hi>Clarendon</hi> said it was Treason, or taking
the King's Crown from his head, to deny
him the Rights of his Ancestours.</p>
            <p>2. That it was <hi>a strange kind of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
Becket</hi> was charged with at <hi>Northam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lett. <hi>p.</hi> 63.</note>
               <hi>viz. for not coming when the King
sent for him;</hi> which <hi>at</hi> the <hi>most</hi> was onely
<hi>a high Contempt; and</hi> Fitz-stephen, <hi>who
was a Creature of the Archbishop's, might
represent it so, to draw an odium on the
King.</hi> And therefore he <hi>looks on this as
a weak precedent for the Bishops to lay any
weight upon, being at best out of a <hi>blind
MS.</hi> of an Authour justly suspected of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality,
against the tenour of all the ancient
Writers that give an account of the same bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness.</hi>
What truth there is in this last
suggestion appears in part already, and
will do more by what follows. Must all
the <hi>unprinted Records</hi> be answered with
saying they are <hi>blind MSS?</hi> I cannot
but take notice how unreasonable a way
of answering this is. It is like turning of
that pressing <hi>Instance,</hi> of the Bishops ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a <hi>Proctor</hi> in <hi>Capital Cases,</hi> by saying
it was <hi>Error temporis;</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 79.</note> which because it
will answer all <hi>Instances</hi> whatsoever as well
as that, is therefore an answer to none.
Just so it is equally an answer to all <hi>MSS,</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:62146:22"/>
to say they are <hi>blind;</hi> and to all <hi>printed
Books</hi> too, because they were once <hi>MSS,</hi>
and, for any thing that appears to the
contrary, as <hi>blind</hi> as <hi>Fitz-stephen</hi>'s. For
surely no authority is added to a Book by
its being printed; unless in the opinion
of the common people, who are said <hi>to
take all for true that is in Print.</hi> I do
not go about to parallel <hi>Fitz-stephen</hi> with
<hi>Parlament-Rolls;</hi> but I say, his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is very good, being present upon the
place, and the best we have, of all the
proceedings in the <hi>Parlament</hi> at <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton.</hi>
And if the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
had taken the pains to peruse him, he
would not have contemned the <hi>Precedent</hi>
drawn from thence; which being so near
the <hi>Parlament</hi> at <hi>Clarendon,</hi> (that, as
himself confesseth,<note place="margin">pag. 61.</note> the <hi>one</hi> was in <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi>
the <hi>other</hi> in <hi>October following,)</hi>
it gives the best Light into this matter of
any thing in that Age; and being not
yet fully printed, it will be worth our
while to set it down. Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> hath
indeed printed very exactly the Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of the <hi>first Iudgment</hi> upon <hi>Becket,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Titles of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, p. 2. c. 5. n. 20.</note>
about the Cause of Contempt, for not
coming upon the <hi>King's Summons,</hi> at the
complaint of <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Marshall;</hi> wherein
the <hi>Bishops</hi> did certainly <hi>sit in Iudgment</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:62146:22"/>
upon him with the other <hi>Barons:</hi> but
there is a farther strength in this <hi>Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi>
not yet taken notice of. Which
is, that after this <hi>Iudgment</hi> passed, <hi>Becket</hi>
behaved himself with so great insolency
towards the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Bishops,</hi> upon
the <hi>King</hi>'s calling him to farther ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
for many other things laid to his
Charge, as <hi>diverting the King's Treasure,</hi>
and applying it to his own use, and <hi>great
Accounts to the King while he was Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,</hi>
&amp;c. that the <hi>King</hi> required him to
stand to the <hi>Iudgment</hi> of his <hi>Court. Becket</hi>
gave a dilatory Answer: the <hi>King</hi> sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Earls</hi> and <hi>Barons,</hi>
to <hi>give Iudgment</hi> against him: the <hi>Bishops</hi>
tell the <hi>King, Becket</hi> had appealed to
the <hi>Pope,</hi> and prohibited them to give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
farther Judgment upon any Secular
Complaint against him. Whereupon the
<hi>King</hi> sent some <hi>Earls</hi> and <hi>Barons</hi> to him,
to expostulate the matter, since he was
the <hi>King's Subject,</hi> and had <hi>so lately sworn</hi>
to the <hi>Constitutions</hi> at <hi>Clarendon;</hi> and to
know whether he would give Security to
the <hi>King</hi> about making up his Accounts,
and stand to the Judgment of his Court.
<hi>Becket</hi> refuseth to give answer to any
thing, but the <hi>Cause</hi> of <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Marshall,</hi>
for which he was summoned to appear;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62146:23"/>
slights his <hi>Oath,</hi> as contrary to the <hi>Rights
of the Church,</hi> and confirms his <hi>Appeal</hi> to
the <hi>Pope.</hi> And <hi>such an owning of the
Pope's Power, in derogation to the Rights
of the Crown,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> saith <hi>was
Treason by the ancient Common Law, before
any Statutes were made.</hi> However, the
<hi>King</hi> charges the <hi>Bishops</hi> by virtue of
their <hi>Allegeance,</hi> that, <hi>together with the
Barons,</hi> they would give <hi>Iudgment</hi> upon
the <hi>Archbishop.</hi> They excused them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<hi>on the account of the Archbishop's
Prohibition.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> replied, <hi>That
had no force against the Constitution of</hi>
Clarendon, <hi>so lately made and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by them.</hi> The words of <hi>Fitz-stephen</hi>
are these: <hi>Rex, responso Archie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopi
accepto, instat Episcopis, praecipiens
&amp; obtestans per homagium &amp; fidelitatem
sibi debitam &amp; juratam, ut simul cum Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronibus
de Archiepiscopo sibi dictent senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam.
Illi se excusare coeperunt per inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positam
Archiepiscopi Prohibitionem. Rex
non acquievit, asserens, quòd non teneat
haec ejus simplex Prohibitio contra hoc quod
Clarendonae factum &amp; initum fuerat.</hi> So
that <hi>H.</hi> II. in the <hi>Parlament</hi> at <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
declared, that <hi>Bishops were bound,
by virtue of the Constitution of</hi> Clarendon,
<hi>to be present,</hi> and <hi>to give their Votes in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62146:23"/>
cases of Treason.</hi> And the <hi>Bishops</hi>' did not
deny this, but used prudential arguments
to disswade the <hi>King</hi> from proceeding
any farther, the <hi>Appeal</hi> being made; and
that <hi>it was for the good of King and
Kingdom,</hi> for them <hi>to submit to the
Prohibition.</hi> And the Bishop of <hi>Chiche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
told <hi>Becket,</hi> he <hi>made them go against
the Constitutions of Clarendon,</hi> which they
had so lately sworn to observe; in these
remarkable words; <hi>Quo contra nos venire
compellitis, interdicendo, nè ei quod de
nobis exigit adesse possumus Iudicio.</hi> By
which we see this <hi>Constitution</hi> is indeed
<hi>an irrefragable Testimony;</hi> but it is to
prove that <hi>Bishops are bound to be present</hi>
even in <hi>Cases of Treason,</hi> when the <hi>King</hi>
summons them. And as to the case of
<hi>Becket</hi>'s <hi>Treason,</hi> the same <hi>Bishop</hi> told him,
it lay in <hi>breaking his Oath</hi> about those
<hi>Constitutions,</hi> wherein <hi>the Rights of
the Crown were declared.</hi> And if this be
not <hi>Treason</hi> by the <hi>Common Law,</hi> Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Cook</hi>'s <hi>Preface</hi> to his fifth <hi>Book of
Reports</hi> signifies nothing.</p>
            <p>The late <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Peerage and
Iurisdiction of the Lords Spirituall</hi>
takes it for granted,<note place="margin">pag. 14.</note> that by the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi>
of <hi>Clarendon</hi> the <hi>Iurisdiction</hi>
of Bishops was limited, that it should
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62146:24"/>
not extend <hi>ad diminutionem membrorum,
vel ad mortem.</hi> But the foregoing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
hath, I suppose, made it evident,
that those words contain no <hi>Limitation,</hi>
but a <hi>Privilege</hi> or <hi>Indulgence</hi> to them
with respect to the <hi>Canon-Law.</hi> And he
takes very needless pains to prove this to
be <hi>declarative of the Common Law;</hi> and
that the Meeting at <hi>Clarendon</hi> was a full
Parlament: which are very much besides
the business.</p>
            <p>All that looks towards this matter, is,
that he saith, this <hi>Statute was confirmed
by a Council at Westminster;</hi> for which
he cites <hi>Rog. Hoveden</hi>'s Authority. But I
wish he had produced the <hi>Canon</hi> entire as
he there found it; for then the sense of it
would have been better understood. In
this <hi>Synod</hi> at <hi>Westminster, Richard Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop</hi>
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> produceth several
<hi>ancient Canons,</hi> which he thought fit to
be observed here. Among the rest, he
mentions <hi>that</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Toledo.</hi>
The words are these: <hi>His qui in Sacris

agitare non licet;</hi> here he makes his
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and leaves out the <hi>Prohibition</hi> which
declares the meaning and extent of
this <hi>Canon: Vnde prohibemus, nè aut per

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62146:24"/>
inferendas judicent; Wherefore we forbid
them, either to dismember any persons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or to give Iudgment for the doing of
it.</hi> Both which were practised in <hi>Spain</hi>
in the time of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Toledo,</hi> which
was the occasion of this <hi>Canon.</hi> And
then follows the <hi>Sanction</hi> of <hi>Deprivation</hi>
if men did otherwise. And what now
doth this signifie more to the <hi>Constitution</hi>
of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> then that the same <hi>Canons</hi>
were now revived, which gave the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to that <hi>permission</hi> of <hi>withdrawing,</hi>
when the <hi>Sentence</hi> came to be pronounced
as to <hi>dismembring,</hi> or <hi>loss of Life?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he urges farther about this <hi>Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 18.</note>
that it must be so understood, as
to exclude the Bishops from all antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and <hi>praeliminary</hi> things which do <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>
or <hi>tend ad diminutionem,</hi> &amp;c. or else,
saith he, <hi>it must be onely the exemption of
the Prelats from doing the Office of Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners,
which is Non-sense.</hi> Why so?
though it be not the whole sense of the
<hi>Canon,</hi> yet surely it is sense. But he
might have thought of <hi>giving Sentence,</hi>
which the <hi>Canons</hi> forbid, and is different
from <hi>Execution,</hi> and doth not exclude
the Bishops presence at <hi>Praeliminaries.</hi>
The <hi>Constitution</hi> of <hi>Westminster,</hi> he saith,
is plainer, <hi>Non debent agitare judicium san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinis;</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:62146:25"/>
which, he saith, excludes the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of any Judicial Power in Cases of
<hi>Bloud.</hi> Whereas it appears by the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition</hi>
there extant, nothing is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
but <hi>giving Sentence;</hi> at which the
<hi>Constitution</hi> of <hi>Clarendon</hi> allows them to
withdraw.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The</hi> second time <hi>we are told that the</hi>
Exclusion <hi>of the</hi> Bishops <hi>in</hi> Cases Capital re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reived
a Confirmation in Parlament,<note place="margin">Lett. <hi>p.</hi> 73.</note> was
the 11. of <hi>R.</hi> II. <hi>When</hi> the Archbishop and
the other Bishops, upon their withdrawing
then from the Parlament, in regard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Bloud were there to be agitated and
determined, in quibus non licet alicui eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum

in which it was not lawfull for any of
them to be present in person, did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
enter a Protestation, with a Salvo to
their Right of Sitting and Voting in that
and all other Parlaments, when such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were not in Question: which Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of theirs was at their desire enrolled in
full Parlament <hi>by the King's Command,
with the Assent of the Lords Temporal
and Commons. So that it is here said
to be</hi> a perfect and compleat Act of Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and if it had not been a Law before,
would then have been made one. <hi>This is

            <p>This <hi>Protestation,</hi> setting aside the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Formalities of it, consists of 3 parts.
1. A Declaration of their undoubted
<hi>Right as Peers of the Realm,</hi> by virtue of
their <hi>Baronies,</hi> to <hi>Sit</hi> and <hi>Vote</hi> in <hi>all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates</hi>
of Parlament. 2. Of their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to <hi>withdraw this Parlament,</hi> because
several matters were to be handled, at
which <hi>it was not lawfull for them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Canons, to be present.</hi> 3. That
by <hi>this absenting</hi> themselves they did not
intend, as far as concerned them, to <hi>null
the proceedings</hi> of that <hi>Parlament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here now arise three main <hi>Points</hi> to be
discussed.</p>
            <p>1. Upon what Grounds the <hi>Prelats</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
it was not lawfull for them to
be present in <hi>Parlament,</hi> at such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:62146:27"/>
2. How far the <hi>Parlament</hi>'s receiving
that <hi>Protestation</hi> makes it a <hi>Law?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Whether on supposition it were a
part of <hi>Canon-Law</hi> then in force, it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
so still since the <hi>Reformation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Upon what Grounds they declared it
unlawfull for them to be present in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament,
at such matters? One would
think the very reading the <hi>Protestation</hi>
were sufficient to convince any man; for
the <hi>Bishops</hi> declare as plainly as men could
do, that it was out of regard to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of the Church,</hi> and not from any <hi>Law
of the Land.</hi> For how was it possible
that the same men should declare, that
by reason of their <hi>Baronies</hi> they had full
<hi>Right</hi> to be personally present in all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
of <hi>Parlament,</hi> if there were some
Law in force which made it unlawfull for
them to be personally present? The
greater force there is in the <hi>Protestation</hi>'s
being receiv'd in Parlament, the greater
strength there is in this Argument. For
if the <hi>Protestation</hi>'s being allowed by
<hi>King, Lords and Commons,</hi> make it (as
the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi> affirms) a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and compleat <hi>Law,</hi> then their <hi>Right</hi>
to be present in all Debates of Parlament
is a <hi>Law;</hi> and so much the more consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
because it is no enacting Law,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62146:27"/>
making that to be so, which was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
but declarative of what was confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to be their <hi>undoubted Right</hi> by <hi>King,
Lords and Commons.</hi> And therefore I do
not wonder, that the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
so conveniently to his purpose, left
out all the beginning of the <hi>Protestation,</hi>
which so fully clears the sense of the rest.
For the very same thing which afterwards
the <hi>Bishops</hi> say they are forbid to doe by
the <hi>Canons,</hi> that is, <hi>personaliter interesse,
to give their personal attendance,</hi> they say
at first, by <hi>Right</hi> of their <hi>Peerage,</hi> as <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons
by tenure,</hi> did belong to them; for
there the words are <hi>personaliter interesse</hi>
too. Therefore <hi>that</hi> personal attendance
in such matters which they said was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
to them by the <hi>Canons,</hi> they chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
to themselves as their just <hi>Right</hi> by
virtue of their <hi>Baronies.</hi> But is it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to imagine, if they had been preclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from sitting by any antecedent Law,
that ever such a publick avowing their
Right would have passed the <hi>King</hi> and
both <hi>Houses?</hi> So unsuccessfull hath the
<hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi> been in his <hi>Statute-Laws,</hi>
that there can be no stronger evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the <hi>Bishops Right</hi> to sit in such
<hi>Cases,</hi> then those which he produceth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:62146:28"/>
But he goes about to prove this <hi>Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition</hi>
cannot be understood <hi>onely of the
Canon-Law:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lett. <hi>p.</hi> 21, 22.</note> 
               <hi>for the Canon-Law,</hi> saith he,
<hi>was to them above all Laws; and what was
forbidden by that Law, they could not have
a thought, that it could in any sort be lawfull
for them to challenge as their Right, upon
any account.</hi> I confess I can see no force
in this Reasoning: For when a thing is
forbidden to men meerly by a <hi>positive Law</hi>
of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>penalty</hi> of it is bare
<hi>Irregularity</hi> by the <hi>Canons;</hi> why may not
such men challenge their own <hi>Right</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
those <hi>Canons,</hi> because the
<hi>Irregularity</hi> might be dispensed with,
when the Pope saw convenient? And by
the <hi>Constitutions</hi> of <hi>O<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

if an Inferiour Clergy-man transgressed
this <hi>Canon,</hi> it was in the power of the
<hi>Diocesan</hi> to absolve him from his Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity.
And this Canon was receiv'd
and inforc'd most here in <hi>England</hi> on the

to the same purpose. Where the <hi>Glosse,</hi>

I will not deny, but they were to be <hi>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular</hi>
by the <hi>Canon-Law,</hi> as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
But then, we are to consider,
how far the <hi>Legatine</hi> Power vested in the
<hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> might extend
in such a <hi>Case;</hi> and that there was the
same severity in the <hi>Canons</hi> against <hi>Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>'s
taking upon them any <hi>Secular</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:
and yet in this very <hi>Parlament,
Thomas Arundell Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ely</hi> was <hi>Lord
Chancellour,</hi> and after him <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
Bishop</hi> of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and before
them <hi>R. Baybroke Bishop</hi> of <hi>London;</hi> and
the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> and <hi>Exceter</hi> were
<hi>Lords Treasurers</hi> under <hi>R.</hi> II. and in <hi>H.</hi> III's
time we find 3 <hi>Clergy-men Lords Chief
Iustices, Pateshull, Lovell</hi> and <hi>Mansell,</hi>
notwithstanding these <hi>Canons;</hi> and in
<hi>Edward</hi> III's time almost all the great <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
of the <hi>Court</hi> were executed by <hi>Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
By which we see they did not
think themselves so strictly bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
those <hi>Canons;</hi> or it was so easy to be
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62146:29"/>
dispensed with, that they had great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to insist upon the challenge of their
own <hi>Right,</hi> notwithstanding the <hi>Canon-Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The truth is, the <hi>Canon-Law,</hi> as it was
managed in those days, was one of the
most mysterious pieces of <hi>Ecclesiasticall
Policy:</hi> it was an <hi>Engine,</hi> which the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
<hi>Church-men</hi> could screw up or let
down as they pleased. If it were in a
matter likely to be prejudicial to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
(as it was most apparently the case
in 11 <hi>R.</hi> II. when matters grew so high
between <hi>R.</hi> II. and the <hi>powerfull Lords,</hi>
and so many <hi>Favourites</hi> were to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached,
and among them <hi>Alexander
Archbishop</hi> of <hi>York,)</hi> then it was a time
to quote the <hi>Canons,</hi> and to enter a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation,</hi>
and to withdraw: If the Times
were calmer and more settled, or some
great Reason moved them, then they
could stick to their <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Peerage,</hi>
and make use of it, either in <hi>Person,</hi> or by
<hi>Proxy,</hi> as they thought convenient. Nor
was it so easy a matter to resolve what
was <hi>Canon-Law</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> but they
might with some colour make use of either
of these <hi>Pleas.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rot. Parlam.</hi> 11 R. 2. p. 1. n. 26.</note> For in this very <hi>Parlament</hi>
11 <hi>R. II.</hi> the <hi>Commons</hi> desire that those
may be reputed <hi>Traitours</hi> who brought
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62146:29"/>
in the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Bulls</hi> of <hi>Volumus &amp; Imponi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus:</hi>
which shews that they did not
think all <hi>Canon-Law</hi> that passed for such
at <hi>Rome.</hi> And 15 <hi>R. II.</hi> Sir <hi>Will. Brian</hi>
was sent to the Tower, for bringing a
<hi>Bull</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> which was judged preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
to the <hi>King,</hi> and derogatory to
his <hi>Laws.</hi> And in 16 <hi>R. II. Will. Courtney,
Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> (the same who
enter'd the <hi>Protestation</hi> before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,)
makes another of a different kind,
owning the <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>Crown</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Encroachments.</hi>
Now, by the same Reason, no <hi>Canon</hi>
made at <hi>Rome,</hi> no <hi>Legatine</hi> or <hi>Synodal
Constitutions,</hi> could have any force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Authority.</hi> But the
<hi>King</hi> himself being under a force at that
time, as he alwaies declared afterwards,
and that being,<note place="margin">Knighton <hi>p.</hi> 2701.</note> as <hi>Knighton</hi> saith it
was called, <hi>Parlamentum sine Misericor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi>
the King having tied himself up, not
to pardon any without consent of the
Lords; he might be willing to let the
<hi>Bishops</hi> excuse themselves; because that
might give some colour to call in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Proceedings then, as it did 21 <hi>R. II.</hi>
when all the Acts of this <hi>Parlament</hi> were
nulled: and the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi>
might be very willing to let the <hi>Bishops</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:62146:30"/>
withdraw, that their business might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
with less difficulty against all the
<hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Ministers.</hi> So that here was a
concurrence of many circumstances, which
made the <hi>Bishops</hi> think fit not to appear
in the <hi>House, this Parlament;</hi> and the
<hi>King, Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> to be willing
to receive their <hi>Protestation.</hi> But in the
<hi>Anti-Parlament</hi> to this, that I mean
21 <hi>R. II.</hi> the <hi>Commons</hi> pray the <hi>King,
that since divers Iudgments were undone
heretofore, for that the Clergy were not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi>
they might appoint <hi>some Common
Proctor</hi> with sufficient Authority to that
purpose. This is a <hi>Passage</hi> which deserves
consideration, and tends very much to
clear the whole matter.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>House of Commons</hi> declare, <hi>that
divers Iudgments had been undone for
want of the Presence of the Clergy.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Concurrence, in the judgment
of the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> was thought
necessary to make a <hi>Iudgment</hi> valid. A
very late <hi>Authour</hi> finds himself so perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with this, that he knows not how to
get off from it.<note place="margin">A Discourse of the Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of the Lords Spiritual, <hi>p.</hi> 26.</note> He cannot deny this to

that <hi>the two Iudgments against
the two</hi> Spencers <hi>were reversed for this
Cause;</hi> but he saith, <hi>there are no more to
be found.</hi> Where doth he mean? in his
<hi>Study?</hi> or not now extant in the <hi>Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Rolls?</hi>
But have we all the <hi>Rolls</hi>
of <hi>Parlament</hi> that were then in being? or
must men so boldly charge the <hi>House of
Commons</hi> with <hi>Ignorance, Errour, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Laws,</hi> because they speak against
their fancies? But this <hi>Gentleman</hi> very
peremptorily concludes <hi>the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
then guilty of a very strange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable
Oversight.</hi> It is great pity,
a certain <hi>Gentleman</hi> had not been there
to have searched <hi>Records</hi> for them, and
to have informed them better. But we
think a <hi>Iudgment</hi> of the <hi>whole House of
Commons</hi> in such a <hi>Case,</hi> declared in so
solemn a manner, without the least con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
from the <hi>King</hi> or the <hi>Lords,</hi>
might deserve a little more respect; and
it had certainly had it, if it had made for
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62146:31"/>
the other side. But we see the <hi>House of
Commons</hi> it self is reverenced, or not, as
the Judgment of it serves mens purposes.
And yet this was more then the bare <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of the <hi>House of Commons:</hi> for a
<hi>Petition</hi> was made upon it, and that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition</hi>
granted; and consequently a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Proctor</hi> appointed, and that <hi>Proctor</hi>
allowed by <hi>King, Lords and Commons.</hi>
So that this was a Judgment ratified by
consent of the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>whole Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament.</hi>
For, if a <hi>Petition</hi> were made
on a false ground, what had been more
proper, then for the <hi>Lords</hi> to have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
this to the <hi>Commons,</hi> and to have
told them how unadvised and false their
<hi>Iudgment</hi> was? whereas the <hi>Lords</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,
and the <hi>Proctor</hi> was admitted,
and gave his <hi>Vote</hi> in the <hi>name</hi> of the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</hi>
But there is something more to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
this <hi>Iudgment</hi> of the <hi>Commons,</hi> and
that is, the <hi>Parlament 11 R. II.</hi> making
<hi>Petition</hi> to the <hi>King, that all Iudgments
then given might be approved, affirmed
and stablished, as a thing duely made for
the Weal and Profit of the King our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Lord, notwithstanding that the Lords
Spiritual and their Procurators were absent
at the time of the said Iudgments given.</hi>
What means this <hi>Petition,</hi> if there had
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62146:31"/>
been no doubt at that time, that these
Judgments might be reversed, as not
duely made, by reason of the absence of
the <hi>Prelats?</hi> The onely answer in my
mind is, that it was <hi>Error Temporis,</hi> they
were of that mind then, but some are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to be of another now.</p>
            <p>But from hence we plainly see, that
even in <hi>R.</hi> II'<hi rend="sup">s</hi> time the Concurrence of
the <hi>Bishops</hi> was thought so necessary, that
one <hi>Parlament</hi> declared <hi>Iudgments had
been reversed for want of it;</hi> and that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Parlament</hi> wherein they absented
themselves, got a <hi>Clause</hi> inserted on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to prevent <hi>the nulling of those Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi>
which signified nothing to the
<hi>Parlament 21 R.</hi> II. which reversed them
all.</p>
            <p>There is something more considerable
to our purpose in this <hi>Parlament; viz.</hi>
that the same <hi>Authour</hi> produceth the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of a <hi>MS. Chronicle,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Discourse of the Peerage, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 20.</note> which large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
handles the Affairs of that <hi>Parlament,</hi>
wherein it is confessed, that the <hi>Bishops,</hi>
by <hi>concurring with the Lords</hi> in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
of the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Arundel</hi>'s Pardon,
did <hi>give Vote</hi> in a <hi>Case Capital:</hi> for so the
words are there cited, <hi>Dederunt ergo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum
Praelati judicio Sanguinis in hoc
facto.</hi> Which shews that the <hi>Bishops</hi> did
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62146:32"/>
then give their <hi>Votes</hi> about the <hi>validity
of the Pardon:</hi> which the <hi>Authour</hi> of that
<hi>Chronicle</hi> indeed condemns them for, and
tells us some thought they incurred <hi>Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity</hi>
by it. From whence it follows,
that all the <hi>Penalty</hi> supposed to be incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
was onely <hi>Canonical;</hi> but he never
charges them with going against the <hi>Law</hi>
or <hi>Custom of Parlament</hi> therein.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Lett. <hi>p.</hi> 30.</note>
               <hi>Whatever was done this Parlament signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
nothing, because the whole Parlament
stands repealed by</hi> 1 H. <hi>IV. and all done in
it delcared null and void.</hi> Yet, to our
comfort,<note place="margin">p. 79.</note> the same <hi>Authour</hi> tells us, <hi>the
three</hi> Henry's <hi>were Usurpers;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I desire to be satisfied, whether an
<hi>Vsurper,</hi> by a <hi>Parlament</hi> of his calling,
can null and repeal what was done by a
<hi>King and his Parlament.</hi> If he may,
then the <hi>King</hi> lost his <hi>Title</hi> to the <hi>Crown</hi>
by the late <hi>Vsurpers;</hi> if not, then the
<hi>Parlament 21 R.</hi> II. could not be repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by that 1 <hi>H.</hi> IV. If the <hi>Authour</hi> of the
<hi>Letter</hi> had considered this, he is a <hi>Person</hi>
of too great Judgment and Loyalty, to
have mention'd, more then once, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
of that <hi>Parlament,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lett.</hi> p. 8<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. pag. 115.</note> by the subsequent
<hi>Parlament 1 H.</hi> IV.</p>
            <p>From all this we see, that by the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62146:32"/>
of the <hi>whole Parlament,</hi> both 11 <hi>R.</hi> II.
and 21 <hi>R</hi> II. the <hi>Bishops</hi> had a right to
sit, so far that <hi>Iudgments</hi> were reversed
where they were not present; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all the pretence they could have for
withdrawing must be from the <hi>Canon-Law:</hi>
which although not sufficient to
bind them, if the matter had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested,
yet it served them for a very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable
pretence of absenting themselves
in such dangerous times, as those of
11 <hi>R.</hi> II.</p>
            <p>Here the <hi>Authour of the Peerage and
Iurisdiction of the Lords Spiritual</hi> thinks
he brings seasonable relief to the <hi>Cause,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 19.</note>
when he undertakes to prove, that the
<hi>Bishops</hi> withdrawing was not meerly on
the account of the <hi>Canon-Law.</hi> This, I
confess, is home to the business, If he
can make it out. (1.) He saith, <hi>there
was an Act of Parlament</hi> before, <hi>that did
expresly prohibit them to excercise Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
in those Cases.</hi> This we utterly
deny. And the <hi>Constitution</hi> of <hi>Clarendon,</hi>
to which he refers, proves the contrary.
(2.) <hi>The Bishops made bold with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi>
when they thought fit,<note place="margin">p 20.</note> as 21 <hi>R.</hi> II.
But how could they doe that, unless they
had a <hi>Parlamentary Right</hi> to be present?
He saith, <hi>the Constituting a Proxy was as
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62146:33"/>
great a violation of the Canons, as being
personally present:</hi> and what then? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Parlament</hi> would not have suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them to doe that, if there had been a
<hi>Law</hi> to exclude them. How doth this
prove that the <hi>Bishops</hi> did not withdraw
on the account of the <hi>Canons</hi> II <hi>R.</hi> II.
because they made a <hi>Proxie 21 R.</hi> II?
But why did they not appear personally,
if they had no regard to the <hi>Canons;</hi>
when the receiving their <hi>Proxie</hi> shewed
they had a <hi>legal Right</hi> to appear? But
he grievously mistakes the meaning of the
<hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Stephen Langton</hi> in <hi>Lyndwood,</hi>
when he interprets <hi>Literas pro poena san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinis
instigenda scribere vel dictare,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
making of <hi>Proxies;</hi> which is onely
meant of giving or <hi>writing the Sentence
for Execution.</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 21.</note> (3.) He saith, they were
excluded <hi>by ancient Custom;</hi> which, by
a very subtle way of reasoning, he proves
to have been <hi>part of the Fundamental
Contract of the Nation,</hi> as he speaks. <hi>Seeing
then,</hi> saith he, <hi>it is without doubt that
there was such a Custom, that the Prelats
should not exercise Iurisdiction in Capital
Cases;</hi> (not so altogether <hi>without doubt,</hi>
unless it were better proved then we
have yet seen it;) <hi>and there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
that doth mention when it did begin,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62146:33"/>
nor any time when it could be said there
never was such an Vsage;</hi> (yes, before the
<hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Toledo</hi> being published in <hi>Spain,</hi>
and receiv'd here;) <hi>it must of necessity
be supposed, that it is as ancient as the
Government it self, and part of the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Contract of the Nation.</hi> Which
looks so like a <hi>Iesuitical</hi> Argument, that
one would have thought he had been
proving <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> by it. For
just thus the Argument runs at this day
among that <hi>Party;</hi> There was a time when
it was reciev'd, and no time can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced
in wherein it was not, therefore
it was a part of the Fundamental Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> the plain Answer in
both cases is the same: If we can produce
unquestionable Authority to which a
Doctrine or Practice is repugnant, we
are not obliged to assign any punctual
time in which it must first come in. But
in this case, we do assign the very time
and occasion of the <hi>Bishops</hi> absenting
themselves in <hi>Capital Iudgments,</hi> and
that was from the receiving the <hi>Canon</hi> of
the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Toledo</hi> here: For no such
practice can ever be proved before. And
therefore this can never be proved to be
any <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>ancient Common Law of
England.</hi> And that this came in by way
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62146:34"/>
of imitation of other <hi>Countries,</hi> appears
by the citing the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Toledo</hi> both
by <hi>Lanfranc</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> in the <hi>Council</hi> of
<hi>Winchester.</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 23.</note> (4.) He saith, the Practice is
<hi>ancienter then any of the Canons of the
Church.</hi> But how doth that appear?
The eldest <hi>Canon</hi> he can find is that of
<hi>Stephen Langton</hi> in <hi>Lyndwood,</hi> which was
made above 50 years after the <hi>Parlament</hi>
at <hi>Clarendon.</hi> But we have made it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
there was a <hi>Canon</hi> receiv'd here in
<hi>Lanfranc</hi>'s time, long before the <hi>Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi>
of <hi>Clarendon.</hi> And so a full An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
is given to these Objections.</p>
            <p>But we are told, by the <hi>Authour</hi> of the
<hi>Letter,</hi> that the <hi>Bishops Protestation</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>receiv'd</hi> and <hi>enter'd</hi> in the <hi>Roll,</hi> or
<hi>Iournal-Book,</hi> makes it to pass for <hi>a Law,</hi>
it being agreed to by the <hi>King</hi> and two
<hi>Houses;</hi> so as whatever was the <hi>Law</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if it were onely the <hi>Canon-Law,</hi> it
is now come to be the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi> of
<hi>Parlament,</hi> and the <hi>Law of the Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. This is therefore the second <hi>Point</hi>
to be examined, Whether the receiving
this <hi>Protestation</hi> amounts to a <hi>Law</hi> of
<hi>Exclusion?</hi> which it can by no means do
for these <hi>two</hi> Reasons: 1. from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>Protestations</hi> in general, 2. from
the particular nature of <hi>this Protestation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:62146:34"/>
1. From the nature of <hi>Protestations</hi> in
general. For a <hi>Protestation</hi> is onely a
Declaration of their minds that make it,
and not of theirs who receive it, or
suffer it to be enter'd in the <hi>Acts</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords</hi>
of the <hi>Court;</hi> unless it be receiv'd in
such a manner, as implies their consent.
For, the very next <hi>Parlament</hi> after this,
13 <hi>R.</hi> II. the two <hi>Archbishops,</hi> in the name
of <hi>the whole Clergy,</hi> enter a <hi>Protestation,
That they gave no assent to any Law or Statute
made in restraint of the Pope's Authority;</hi>
and it is said in the <hi>Rolls</hi> of <hi>Parlament,
that at their requests these Protestations were
enrolled.</hi> Will any man hence inferre,
that these <hi>Protestations</hi> were made <hi>Acts
of Parlament?</hi> If the <hi>Cause</hi> would have
born any better, a Person of so much
skill in <hi>proceedings</hi> of <hi>Parlament</hi> would
never have used such an Argument as
this. Besides, it is a Rule in <hi>Protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sum. l. 1. de Constit. <hi>n</hi> 18. pag. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Si Protestatio in Iudicio fiat, semper per
contrarium actum tollitur,</hi> saith <hi>Hostiensis;
A Protestation, although allowed in Court,
is taken off by a subsequent Act contrary to it.</hi>
Which shews, that a <hi>Protestation</hi> can never
have the force of a <hi>Law;</hi> because it may
be destroy'd by the <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>Parties</hi>
themselves. If therefore the <hi>Bishops</hi> did
afterwards act contrary to this <hi>Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:62146:35"/>
they took away all the force of it.</p>
            <p>2. The particular nature of this <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station</hi>
is such, as doth most evidently
preserve their <hi>Right</hi> to be personally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
on the account of their <hi>Peerage</hi> and
<hi>Baronies;</hi> and the great design of a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation</hi>
is, <hi>to preserve a Right notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
some Act which seems to destroy
it;</hi> as thier <hi>absenting themselves</hi> on the
account of the <hi>Canons</hi> might seem to doe.
But of this already.</p>
            <p>3. We are now to consider the third
<hi>Point,</hi> Whether, on supposition that on
the account of the <hi>Canon-Law,</hi> the <hi>Bishops</hi>
had always withdrawn in the time of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi>
that had continued in force still
since the <hi>Reformation?</hi> I think not,
upon these Reasons.</p>
            <p>1. Because the <hi>Canon-Law</hi> was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon a Superstitious fancy, <hi>viz.</hi> that
if <hi>Clergy-men</hi> be present in <hi>Causes of Bloud,</hi>
they contract Irregularity <hi>ex defectu per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectae
Lenitatis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Man<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>al. c. 27.</note> as the excellent <hi>Canonist,
Navarr,</hi> saith, because it argues <hi>a want
of perfect Lenity.</hi> But if we consider the
<hi>cases</hi> they allow, which do <hi>not incurre
Irregularity,</hi> and those they do not allow,
which <hi>do</hi> incurre it, we shall find all this
stir in the <hi>Canon-Law</hi> about this matter to
be onely a Superstitious kind of Hypocrisy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:62146:35"/>
1. If a man in <hi>Orders</hi> gives another
man Weapons, without which he could
not defend himself, and by those wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
he maims him that assaulted him;
this doth not make him <hi>irregular:</hi> but if
he kills him, it doth: and yet the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi>
make the case of Dismembring and
Death the same.</p>
            <p>2. It makes a man act against the <hi>Law
or Nature</hi> to prevent <hi>Irregularity.</hi> For
they say, if it be for the defence of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or Mother, or preventing the ruin of
his Country, although the Cause be never
so just, a <hi>Clergy-man</hi> that dismembers, or
takes away another's life, is <hi>irregular.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. If a <hi>Clergy-man</hi> discovers Treason,
or accuses another for Treason, without
a Protestation, that he doth not doe it
with a design to have him punished; he
is <hi>irregular:</hi> but if he makes that Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station,
although death follows, he is
not.</p>
            <p>4. If a <hi>Clergy-man</hi> be in an Army, and
perswades the Souldiers to fight manfully,
and kill as many as they can; this doth
not make him <hi>irregular;</hi> ny, although
he beats them, if they will not fight:
but if he happens to kill an enemy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
then he is.</p>
            <p>5. If he gives a Souldier a Sword or a
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62146:36"/>
Gun, by which he dispatches his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
if he did it with a particular inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that he should slay or maim them,
he is <hi>irregular;</hi> if onely with a general
intention, that he should overcome, he
is not. This being somewhat a nice
Case, the <hi>Canonists</hi> take more then usual
pains to prove it. And from hence they
defend their <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Iesuits</hi> in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
who carry the <hi>Cross</hi> before their
Armies into the Field, and encourage
them to kill all they can: and yet <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varr</hi>
saith, they are so far from being
<hi>irregular,</hi> that they are <hi>regularissimi,</hi> as
his word is.</p>
            <p>6. If a man, to gain an Indulgence,
carries a faggot to burn an Heretick, if it
be with a design to take away his life, he
is <hi>irregular:</hi> but if he be hanged first, or
dead before it be thrown into the fire,
then he is not.</p>
            <p>7. If a man in <hi>Orders</hi> helps a Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
in cutting off a man's Leg, he is not
<hi>irregular:</hi> but if a man be justly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to have his Leg cut off, if he
then gives any assistence, he is <hi>irregular:</hi>
because the one is moved out of Mercy,
and the other out of Justice.</p>
            <p>8. If the <hi>Bishops</hi> sit and condemn a
man for Heresy, and deliver him over to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62146:36"/>
the <hi>Secular Power</hi> for Execution; yet
they free this from <hi>Irregularity,</hi> or else
the practice of the <hi>Inquisition</hi> were lost.
This seems a very difficult Case: but the
<hi>Canonists</hi> salve this,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Covarruv.</hi> ad Clem. fi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rios. p. 2. § 5. n. 6.</note> by saying that the
<hi>Inquisitours,</hi> when they deliver them
over to the <hi>Secular Power,</hi> do pray <hi>that
they may not be hurt either Wind or Lim;</hi>
as it appears by the <hi>Forms</hi> used in the
<hi>Directorium Inquisitorum.</hi> And if this be
not the height of Hypocrisie, let the
World judge. And therefore this part
of the <hi>Canon-Law</hi> is not consistent with
the Sincerity of the <hi>Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. This part of <hi>Canon-Law</hi> is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with the <hi>King's Power</hi> over <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Persons.</hi> For it supposeth them
liable to the penalty of a <hi>Law,</hi> which he
hath no cognisance of, and derives no
force or authority from him: which tends
to the diminution of the <hi>King's Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Royal,</hi> and therefore it is nulled by
the <hi>Stat. 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> H.</hi> VIII. <hi>c.</hi> 19. I do very
much question whether this ever were
any part of the <hi>Canon-Law</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>
notwithstanding the <hi>Pope's Decretals;
i. e.</hi> whether these <hi>Canons</hi> ever received
confirmation by the <hi>Royal Authority,</hi>
either in <hi>Synodal Constitutions,</hi> or else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.
And it would be a very hard
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62146:37"/>
case, if <hi>our Kings</hi> had not the same Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
which are allow'd in <hi>Popish Countries;
viz.</hi> that nothing passes for <hi>Canon-Law</hi>
within their <hi>Territories,</hi> till it pass the
examination of the <hi>King's Council,</hi> and
approbation by his <hi>Authority.</hi> Thence
in <hi>France</hi> nothing passes without the
<hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Pareatis;</hi> nor in <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
without the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi>'s <hi>Placet;</hi>
no nor in the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the <hi>Royal Exequatur.</hi> It is well
known, that the 6. <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Decretals</hi> was
not allowed in <hi>France,</hi> because of the
quarrel between the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi>
VIII. and that even the <hi>Council</hi> of
<hi>Trent</hi> it self was not allowed by <hi>Philip</hi> II.
till it had been strictly examined by the
<hi>King's Council,</hi> that nothing might be
allowed which tended to the diminution
of his <hi>Prerogative.</hi> How then will men
justifie the making that a part of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-Law</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> which was repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>Crown,</hi> and
deprives the <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Power</hi> of taking
advice of those of his Subjects, whom he
hath summon'd for that end?</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Sanction</hi> of this <hi>Law</hi> is ceased,
which was <hi>Irregularity:</hi> And some of our
most Learned <hi>Iudges</hi> have declared, that
is taken away by the <hi>Reformation.</hi> But
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62146:37"/>
in case any be of another opinion, I shall
urge them with this inconveniency; <hi>viz.</hi>
that the great <hi>Instrument</hi> of discovering
the <hi>Plot</hi> falls under <hi>Irregularity</hi> by it.
For it is most certain, by the <hi>Canon-Law,</hi>
that a man in <hi>Orders</hi> accusing others of
<hi>Treason,</hi> without making his due <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation</hi>
in <hi>Court,</hi> is <hi>Irregular.</hi> But if
this be now thought unreasonable, as it
is, in the person of an <hi>Accuser,</hi> why should
it not be so in the case of <hi>Iudges?</hi> And
if the <hi>Irregularity</hi> be taken away, then
the <hi>Sanction</hi> is gone: and if the <hi>Sanction</hi>
be taken off in a meer <hi>positive Law,</hi> the
<hi>force</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> is gone too. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this <hi>Canon-Law,</hi> which forbids <hi>Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
being present in Capital Cases, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Votes therein,</hi> is wholly taken away
by the <hi>Reformation.</hi> And we do not find
any mention of it for 80 years and more
after the <hi>Reformation;</hi> till about the time
of the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s Trial, a <hi>Book</hi>
being printed about the <hi>Privilege</hi> of <hi>Peers,</hi>
wherein this <hi>Protestation</hi> was mention'd,
hold was presently taken of it, by Men
who thought they could not compass
their ends without removing the <hi>Bishops</hi>
out of the <hi>House:</hi> and when the <hi>Bishops</hi>
insisted on their <hi>Right,</hi> and could not be
heard, but at last were willing to <hi>salve</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:62146:38"/>
their <hi>Right</hi> by <hi>Proxies;</hi> the <hi>Lords</hi> of the
<hi>Cabal</hi> prevailed with their friends, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
they would use no <hi>Proxies</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and so by that artifice shut the
<hi>Bishops</hi> out of Doors.</p>
            <p>4. The practice hath been so contrary,
since the Reformation, that I find no
manner of regard hath been shewed to it.
For the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was the
first nominated in the <hi>Commission</hi> for the
Trial of the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scots;</hi> as appears
by the <hi>Commission</hi> it self in <hi>Camden;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Camden.</hi> Annal. A. D. 1586.</note>
which is directly contrary to the <hi>Canon-Law.</hi>
Some distinguish the <hi>Bishops</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
by <hi>Commission,</hi> from their being
<hi>Iudges in Parlament.</hi> For which there is
no manner of Reason with respect to the
<hi>Canon-Law,</hi> which is rather more express
against any kind of <hi>Commissions</hi> in Cases
of Bloud; as appears by the <hi>Council</hi> of
<hi>Toledo,</hi> the <hi>Synodal Constitution,</hi> and the
<hi>Pope's Decretals.</hi> And there hath never
been any scruple about <hi>Divines</hi> sitting on
the <hi>Crown-side</hi> as <hi>Iustices of the Peace,</hi>

when <hi>Sentence of death is pronounced;</hi> nor
in the <hi>Ordinary</hi>'s declaring <hi>Legit,</hi> or <hi>Non

But, which is yet more to our present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
in the <hi>Parlament 22. May</hi> 1626. up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Impeachment of the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol</hi>

of <hi>high Treason, 10 Bishops, 10 Earls,
10 Barons,</hi> were appointed to examine
the Evidence; and upon their Report he
was sent to the <hi>Tower</hi> by the <hi>whole House.</hi>
All which shews, that there hath been
no regard had to the force of the <hi>Canon-Law</hi>
in this matter since the <hi>Reformation:</hi>
That being a Spirit lay'd long since by

               <note place="margin">pag. 59.</note> 
               <hi>Here we see,</hi> saith the <hi>Authour</hi> of
the <hi>Letter, it was onely</hi> ad Comites &amp; Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rones
<hi>that he appealed, and they were one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62146:39"/>
to judge of it, and not Bishops or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have 2 things to answer to this <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent.</hi>
1. That we have great reason to
suspect the truth of it. 2. That if it were
true, we have no reason to suspect the
Bishops to be excluded.</p>
            <p>1. For the truth of the Story. That
there is great reason to suspect it, appears,
in that it is the single relation of <hi>Bromp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
against the consent of the other <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians,</hi>
(and some of them much ancien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and nearer to that time,) who men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
K. <hi>Edward</hi>'s charging <hi>Earl Godwin</hi>
with the Death of his Brother, not in
<hi>Parlament,</hi> but as they were at Table to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
at <hi>Winchester,</hi> upon the occasion
of a saying of <hi>Earl Godwin</hi>'s, upon the
King's Cup-bearer's stumbling with one
foot, and recovering with another; <hi>See,</hi>
saith he, <hi>how one Brother helps another.</hi>
Upon which <hi>Matt. Westminster, Knighton,</hi>
and others say, that the King charged him
about the Death of his Brother <hi>Alfred.</hi>
Whatever the occasion was, our best <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians</hi>
of that time, <hi>Malmsbury</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulphus,</hi>
say, it was at an Entertainment
at <hi>Winchester,</hi> and that <hi>Earl Godwin</hi> died
upon the place; being choaked, as they
say, with a Morsel of Bread he took with
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62146:39"/>
a great Execration upon himself if he were
not innocent. <hi>Knighton</hi> saith, he was
question'd for the Death of his Brother
by <hi>Hardecnute,</hi> and that he cleared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
by saying he did nothing but by the
King's command. But suppose <hi>Edward</hi>
to be never so weak a Prince, is it
likely this should be done by an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
in Parlament by the King himself;
and that afterwards, by the Judgment of
his Earls and Barons, he and his Sons and
12 Kinsmen should make the King amends,
by as much Gold and Silver as they could
carry between their Arms? Besides,
<hi>Brompton</hi> saith, this was done by <hi>Godwin</hi>
when he returned to <hi>England,</hi> after King
<hi>Edward</hi>'s coming to the Throne; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<hi>Malmsbury</hi> shews, that it was through
<hi>Earl Godwin</hi>'s interest, that ever he came
to it; and so the marrying his Daughter
would make any one believe.</p>
            <p>2. But suppose it true. What reason
is there to conclude the Bishops not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
who were never absent through all
the <hi>Saxon</hi> times, after <hi>Ethelbert</hi>'s Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
in any publick <hi>Councils</hi> of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
They had no <hi>Canon</hi> then to be
afraid of; for that of the Council of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo</hi>
was brought in by <hi>Lanfranc.</hi> And
it was not against the practice of those
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62146:40"/>
Times. For if we believe as true a <hi>Story</hi>
as this of <hi>Brompton,</hi> the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> himself condemned King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>'s
Mother <hi>Emma</hi> to a Trial by hot
Irons, which was present death without
a Miracle: and this it is said was done by
the consent <hi>of the King and the Bishops;</hi>
which is as good a <hi>Precedent</hi> against <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Lords,</hi> as the other is against the
<hi>Bishops.</hi> However, this is certain, that
the Bishops then sate in the <hi>County-Court</hi>
at all <hi>Iudgments.</hi> And whereas the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour</hi>
of the <hi>Letter</hi> would avoid this, by
saying that no <hi>Capital Crimes</hi> were tried
there;<note place="margin">Lett. <hi>p.</hi> 110.</note> the contrary is most certainly
true. For the <hi>Laws</hi> of King <hi>Edward,</hi> as
they were set forth by <hi>H.</hi> I. <hi>c.</hi> 31. men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the <hi>Capitalia Placita</hi> that were there
held. And the Authour of the <hi>MS.</hi> Life
of S. <hi>Cuthbert</hi> saith, that when one of
<hi>Earl Godwin</hi>'s Sons was <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi>
and one <hi>Hamel,</hi> a very bad man,
was imprison'd by him, his Friends inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded
earnestly with him, <hi>nè capite plec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teretur,
that he should not lose his head.</hi>
By which it appears, that <hi>Cases Capital</hi>
were heard and determin'd in those <hi>Courts,</hi>
the <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Earl</hi> sitting together in
<hi>Iudgment.</hi> And here the Point is plainly
gain'd, because the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:62146:40"/>
grants that the <hi>Bishops</hi> sate in all <hi>Iudgments</hi>
in the <hi>County-Courts,</hi> and then puts the
matter upon this Issue, whether <hi>Capital
Crimes</hi> were there tried or not; which I
have clearly proved that they were. But
I shall make another advantage of this
against the <hi>Authour</hi> of <hi>the Peerage, &amp;c.</hi> for
it plainly overthrows that confident As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
of his,<note place="margin">Lett. <hi>p.</hi> 21.</note> That <hi>without doubt</hi> there
was a Negative <hi>Custom, that the Prelates
should not exercise Iurisdiction in Capital
Cases,</hi> so <hi>ancient</hi> as to be <hi>part of the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Contract of the Nation.</hi> It were
a thousand pities that such well-sounding
words, so handsomely put together, should
signifie nothing. I dare not be so posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
as he is, but am of opinion, that if
he could be perswaded to produce this
<hi>Fundamental Contract of the Nation,</hi> which
I perceive he hath lying by him, it would
not amount to so much as a <hi>blind Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript.</hi>
If it be said, that <hi>Brompton</hi> onely
mentions <hi>Earls</hi> and <hi>Barons,</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi>
were not then made <hi>Barons;</hi> I answer,
that <hi>Baronies</hi> were brought into <hi>England</hi>
by the <hi>Conquerour,</hi> and therefore <hi>Bromp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
must speak improperly, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
taking it onely for a Title of
Honour, he means no more then those
who were the Great men of that time,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62146:41"/>
and so may take in the Bishops too: of
which more afterwards. But there is one
thing more in the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>H. I.</hi> (which
were onely a restoring K. <hi>Edward's Laws)</hi>
that implies that <hi>Bishops</hi> had then a Power
of Judging in <hi>Cases Capital;</hi> which is
<hi>c. 58. Qui occiderit Episcopum sit in arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trio
Principis &amp; Episcoporum, He that kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a Bishop was to be left to the Will of the
King and the Bishops.</hi> Which shews that
they were to hear and examine the whole
Evidence, and to give Judgment accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to it.</p>
            <p>After the <hi>Saxon</hi> times,<note place="margin">Lett. <hi>p.</hi> 55.</note> the <hi>first Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
produced is of the 33 <hi>Edw. I.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Nicolas Segrave,</hi> who was sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd
to appear in <hi>Parlament,</hi> and after
his Offences were open'd, the King ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises
<hi>onely with the Temporal Lords,</hi> who
declared, such a man deserved to lose his
Life. But is he sure the <hi>Bishops</hi> were
not present? No: he saith, <hi>that doth not
appear by the Record; but it appears clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they were not to meddle with it.</hi> How
so? <hi>The King declares, that he would have
the Advice Comitum, Baronum, Magnatum,
&amp; aliorum de Consilio suo.</hi> But is he sure they
are not comprehended under <hi>Magnates,</hi>
and that there were no <hi>Clergy-men</hi> at that
time of the King's Counsel? What thinks
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62146:41"/>
he is <hi>William de Hamilton, Dean</hi> of <hi>York<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
who was made <hi>Lord Chancellour Ian. 16.
33 Edw. I.</hi> and this <hi>Parlament</hi> was held
the next Sunday after S. <hi>Matthias,</hi> which
was the latter end of <hi>February?</hi> And in
the 35. year, <hi>Ralph de Baldock, Bishop</hi>
of <hi>London,</hi> was made <hi>Lord Chancellour:</hi>
and scarce any other but <hi>Church-men</hi> had
that <hi>Office</hi> all his days. The <hi>Bishop</hi> of
<hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi> was <hi>Chancellour</hi> near twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years of his Reign; after him the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
of <hi>Ely;</hi> after him the <hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>Chiche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;</hi>
and then comes the <hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>York.</hi>
And among the <hi>Lords Treasurers</hi> of his
time; were the <hi>Archdeacon</hi> of <hi>Dorset,</hi>
the <hi>Abbot</hi> of <hi>Westminster,</hi> two <hi>Bishops</hi> of
<hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> whereof one was <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer</hi>
at this time. These <hi>two,</hi> I hope,
we may suppose to be of the <hi>King's
Counsel</hi> in this business; who we are
certain were both <hi>Church-men.</hi> And if
they adjudged <hi>Nic. de Segrave</hi> worthy of
death, who so likely to deliver that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as the <hi>Chancellour?</hi> But suppose
these were not there, whom doth he
mean by the <hi>Magnates</hi> then distinct from
<hi>Earls</hi> and <hi>Barons,</hi> who were of the <hi>House
of Peers?</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> will inform him,
if he needs it, that there were no <hi>Dukes</hi>
till the II. of <hi>Edw. III.</hi> nor the Title of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62146:42"/>
               <hi>Marquess</hi> till <hi>R. II.</hi> nor of <hi>Vicount</hi> till
<hi>H. VI.</hi> And yet here were <hi>Magnates</hi> in
Parlament, who were neither Earls nor
Barons: and therefore we must in all
reason understand the great <hi>Church-men,</hi>
who were not so nice of meddling with
<hi>Criminal Causes</hi> in Parlament of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
nature in the time of <hi>Edw. I.</hi> As ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the great <hi>Cause</hi> so much agitated
in Parlament 20 <hi>Edw. I.</hi> concerning the
<hi>Earls</hi> of <hi>Hereford</hi> and <hi>Gloucester;</hi> where
this latter is charged with raising Arms
without Commission, and committing
Murthers and horrible Devastations in
the Lands belonging to the other; and
the King in Parlament appoints the <hi>Bishop</hi>
of <hi>Ely</hi> with others to be a <hi>Committee</hi> for
examination of this matter. And when
they had both submitted to the King's
Pleasure, we have these remarkable words
in the <hi>Placita Parlamentaria. <hi>Per Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silium

               </hi> and then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
the <hi>Sentence;</hi> which I confess did
not extend to Life, but to a Forfeiture
of his Estate to the King. However, we
see hereby that the <hi>Bishops</hi> were present
at all the <hi>praeliminary Debates,</hi> and the
King asked their <hi>Advice;</hi> so that they
had their <hi>Votes</hi> in the <hi>Sentence,</hi> whether
it should extend to Life or not.</p>
            <p>In the Reign of <hi>Edw. II.</hi> we meet with
a remarkable <hi>Precedent</hi> in behalf of the
<hi>Bishops Right,</hi> which is of a <hi>Iudgment</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
made by the <hi>Lords <hi>without the
Prelats,</hi> viz.</hi> the <hi>Iudgment</hi> against the
two <hi>Spencers 15 E. II.</hi> which <hi>Iudgment</hi> is
said to be passed at <hi>Oxford</hi> that year, but
in the <hi>Parlament</hi> at <hi>York,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Claus. 15 Ed. 2. n. 23, 24. &amp; dors. 13. 32.</note> the same year,
it was nulled and made void before the
King, Lords and Commons; and one of
the Reasons given for it is, <hi>because the
Lords Spiritual, who were Peers, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
not to it.</hi> This <hi>Precedent</hi> had
been cited and allowed by Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> in
his <hi>Plea for the Lords;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plea for the Lords, <hi>p.</hi> 193.</note> and therefore it is
to be wonder'd the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi>
takes no notice of it. But the later <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour</hi>
of <hi>the Discourse about the Bishops
Peerage and Iurisdiction,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Discourse of the Bishops Peerage, <hi>pag.</hi> 20.</note> owns the truth
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62146:43"/>
of the thing, saying, <hi>that the two Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
aganst the two</hi> Spencers <hi>were rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi>
15 Edw. II. <hi>for this Cause, through
the great favour and interest they then had
at Court.</hi> But then he thinks he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off the force of this <hi>Precedent,</hi> by
saying <hi>that</hi> 1 Edw. <hi>III.</hi> c. 1. <hi>this Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is declared good, and therefore the
said Reversal null and void; and the two</hi>
Spencers <hi>upon this affirmance of the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were executed.</hi> This last Assertion
every one knows to be a grievous mistake,
that hath but looked into our <hi>History:</hi>
for the <hi>Spencers</hi> were executed before
<hi>Edw.</hi> III. came to the Crown; the elder
in <hi>October 19 Edw.</hi> II. the other the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
end of <hi>November 20 Edw.</hi> II. And
whereas he insists upon the <hi>Affirmance of
the Iudgment 1 Edw.</hi> III. he had done well
to have look'd a little farther, and then
he would have found that Act also repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
21 <hi>R.</hi> II. So that if the <hi>Act</hi> of
1 <hi>Ed.</hi> III. which affirms the first Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
may seem to take off the force of
this <hi>Precedent,</hi> the repealing of that <hi>Act</hi>
in the 21 <hi>R. II.</hi> restores it again, and
leaves it in its full force. Especially if it
be considered, that the <hi>Act</hi> of 1 <hi>Ed. III.</hi>
was not barely repealed, but declar'd in
Parlament to be unlawfull, because <hi>Ed. II.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62146:43"/>
was living,</hi>

of 1 Ed. III.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far this <hi>Precedent</hi> is good. But
I will conceal nothing that may with any
colour be objected against it. And I
cannot deny but what the <hi>Authour</hi> of the
<hi>Letter</hi> objects, against the Bishops consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting
a <hi>Proctor</hi> to represent them in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
Causes, seems to be of equal force
against this <hi>Precedent, viz. That this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament
of the 21 R. II. and all that was
done in it, was repeal'd in the 1 H. IV.</hi>
And if that be so, (and those Acts of
State which then passed had not again
been repealed 1 <hi>Ed. IV.)</hi> then the Repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of that of 1. <hi>Ed. III.</hi> signifies nothing,
and consequently the <hi>Affirmance</hi> of the
<hi>first Iudgment</hi> against the two <hi>Spencers</hi> is
good notwithstanding that Repeal. And
therefore that we may examine this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the bottom, I shall set down the
very words of the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi>
concerning it. Speaking of the <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
made by the Lawyers in the 10 <hi>Ed. IV.</hi>
concerning the Bishops making a <hi>Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator</hi>
in Capital Causes, he hath these
words:<note place="margin">pag. 79.</note> 
               <hi>It is true, here is mention made
of their making a Proctor, which was</hi> Error
temporis, <hi>the Errour of those times, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62146:44"/>
upon what was so lately done, (as they
looked upon it) though irregularly done, in
the last Parlament of R. II. whom they
consider'd as their lawfull King; and in
truth he was so, the three</hi> Henry's <hi>that
came between being but Vsurpers.</hi> And
again, speaking of the same business of a
<hi>Proctor</hi> in the 21 <hi>R. II.</hi> he hath this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
passage:<note place="margin">pag. 115.</note> 
               <hi>I have already shewed,
that this whole Parlament was repeal'd for
the extravagant things that were done in it,
of which this was one. And therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that was then done can signifie any
thing to a leading case any ways to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed;
and this as little as any: except
it could be made appear, which I am
confident it cannot, that some Iudgment
had been reversed upon that account, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Prelats were not present, and
had not given their assent to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if I can make out these <hi>two</hi>
things, 1. That the Parlament of <hi>R. II.</hi>
was not legally repeal'd; 2. That the
<hi>Iudgment</hi> against the two <hi>Spencers</hi> was
revers'd, and that the Repeal of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
in 1 <hi>Ed. III.</hi> was revok'd in 21 <hi>R. II.</hi>
upon this very account, <hi>because the
Prelats were not present, and had not
given their assent to it;</hi> I hope the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour</hi>
of the <hi>Letter</hi> will be satisfy'd, that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62146:44"/>
both this <hi>Precedent,</hi> and the Case of a
<hi>Proctor,</hi> are very significant in this Cause;
and that there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
being <hi>confident,</hi> and <hi>certain</hi> of any
thing.</p>
            <p>1. That the Parlament of 21 <hi>R. II.</hi>
was not legally repeal'd. And for this I
take the <hi>Authour</hi>'s own acknowledgment,
that <hi>R. II. was in truth lawfull King,</hi> and
that <hi>H. IV.</hi> was but an <hi>Vsurper:</hi> Nay, I
add farther, that <hi>R. II.</hi> was alive and in
prison when <hi>H. IV.</hi> repeal'd the Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of 21 <hi>R. II.</hi> For so it is said in the
very <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Repeal,</hi> that <hi>R. II. late King
of</hi> England <hi>was pursued, taken, put in
ward, and <hi>yet remaineth in ward.</hi>
               </hi> And
now I leave it to the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
whether a Parlament call'd by a
lawfull King, and the Acts of it, ought
to be deem'd legally repeal'd by a Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that was call'd by an Usurper, and
held whilst the lawfull King was alive,
and detain'd in prison.</p>
            <p>2. That the <hi>Iudgment</hi> against the two
<hi>Spencers</hi> was revers'd, and the Repeal of
the Reversal of it in 1 <hi>Ed. III.</hi> revok'd
in 21 <hi>R. II.</hi> and that upon this very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<hi>because the Prelats were not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and had not given their assent to
it;</hi> which the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi> is
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62146:45"/>
               <hi>confident cannot be made appear.</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 115.</note> That
this <hi>Iudgment</hi> was reversed for this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
I have already shewn, <hi>viz.</hi> in the
Parlament at <hi>York 15 Ed. II.</hi> And I shall
now shew, that the Repeal of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
in 1 <hi>Edw. III.</hi> was revok'd in
21 <hi>R. II.</hi> and that upon the account men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
For in this Parlament <hi>Tho. le
Despenser,</hi> Earl of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> exhibited
<hi>two Bills,</hi> in which he prayeth that the
Revocation of the Exile of the two <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi>
in 15 <hi>Ed. II.</hi> might be brought before
the King and confirmed, and that the
<hi>Repeal</hi> of the same made in the 1 <hi>Ed. III.</hi>
might be revoked. Of which <hi>Act</hi> of
<hi>Repeal</hi> these <hi>Errours</hi> are assigned, among
others:<note place="margin">Kot. 55, 56. 21 R. 2.</note> 
               <hi>because the Prelats, <hi>who are
Peers of the Realm,</hi> did not assent to the
Iudgment;</hi> and <hi>because it was made onely
by the Earls and Barons, Peers of the
Realm,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>because it was made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the form of the Great Charter of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>in which it is contain'd, that no man
shall be exil'd, or otherwise destroyed, but
by the lawfull Iudgment of his Peers, or by
the Law of the Land.</hi> So that it seems it
was look'd upon as a breach of the <hi>Great
Charter,</hi> for the Temporal Lords to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
a Peer without the Assent of the
Bishops, and that such a <hi>Iudgment</hi> was
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62146:45"/>
not esteem'd <hi>a lawfull Iudgment by his
Peers.</hi> And those <hi>Errours</hi> of the <hi>first
Iudgment</hi> assign'd in the <hi>Revocation</hi> of it
in 15 <hi>Ed. II.</hi> are allowed in this Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of 21 <hi>R. II.</hi> and that <hi>Revocation</hi>
confirm'd, and the <hi>Repeal</hi> of it in 1 <hi>Ed. III.</hi>
revok'd upon the same account. I shall
onely observe,<note place="margin">R. 2. 21.</note> that in this Parlament (as
before in 15 <hi>Ed. II.)</hi> the <hi>Bishops</hi> are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to be <hi>Peers; <hi>Peers of the Realm,</hi>
Rot. 55. <hi>Peers in Parlament,</hi> Rot.</hi> 56.
&amp; 61; but most fully and distinctly in
the <hi>Roll</hi> last cited, <hi>Peers of the Realm
in Parlament.</hi> Of which farther use
may be made in the <hi>last Chapter</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the <hi>Peerage of the Bishops.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now to sum up the force of this
<hi>Precedent</hi> for the <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
in <hi>Cases of Treason.</hi> Here is a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal</hi>
of a <hi>Iudgment,</hi> because <hi>made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Assent of the Prelats,</hi> by the Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at <hi>York</hi> in 15 <hi>Ed. II.</hi> And whereas
it is said this <hi>Reversal</hi> was <hi>repeal'd,</hi> and
the <hi>first Iudgment affirm'd</hi> in 1 <hi>Ed. III.</hi> I
have shew'd, that this was no <hi>legal Repeal,</hi>
because <hi>Ed. II.</hi> was <hi>alive,</hi> and <hi>lawfull
King,</hi> (or else <hi>Ed. III.</hi> could never have
been so) in the time of that first Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Ed. III.</hi> and consequently <hi>Ed. III.</hi>
at that time was an Usurper, and the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62146:46"/>
Proceedings of that Parlament null and
void. So that the <hi>Reversal</hi> in 15 <hi>Ed. II.</hi>
stands good, notwithstanding the <hi>Repeal</hi>
in 1 <hi>Ed. III.</hi> Besides that this <hi>Repeal</hi>
(whatever it was) is solemnly <hi>revok'd</hi> in
21 <hi>R. II.</hi> And <hi>H. IV.</hi> who <hi>revers'd</hi> all
the Proceedings of the Parlament of
21 <hi>R. II.</hi> during the life of <hi>R. II.</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
by the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi>
to have been an <hi>Vsurper,</hi> and <hi>R. II.</hi> to
have been a <hi>lawfull King.</hi> And now I
think that this <hi>Precedent</hi> hath all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
that can be, and that the <hi>Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the Bishops</hi> in <hi>Cases of Treason</hi>
could not have been asserted in a higher
manner, then to have a <hi>Iudgment</hi> in <hi>Case
of Treason</hi> solemnly revers'd in two Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laments
for this very cause, <hi>because the
Bishops, who are Peers, assented not to it:</hi>
And this <hi>Precedent</hi> own'd by the <hi>House of
Commons,</hi> in their <hi>Petition</hi> to have a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Proctor</hi> appointed by the <hi>Clergy,</hi> in
this very Parlament of 21 <hi>R. II.</hi> as is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
by the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 115.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude this matter; whether the
Acts of Parlament which contain this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of the <hi>Peerage</hi> of Bishops, and
their <hi>Iurisdiction in Cases of Treason,</hi> were
sufficiently repeal'd or not; this solemn
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62146:46"/>
Assertion of it in two several Parlaments,
together with the <hi>Petition</hi> of the <hi>Commons</hi>
mentioned before, are a most clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that in the general Opinion of
the <hi>King, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> this
<hi>Iurisdiction</hi> did of right belong to the
Bishops. And I am sure they are a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
against the <hi>Authour of the
Peerage</hi> his Assertion, of a Negative <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,
ancient as the Constitution of the
Nation,</hi> that <hi>Prelats should not exercise
Iurisdiction in Capital Cases.</hi> For had
this been a clear and undoubted Custom
from the first original of this Nation, it is
morally impossible it could have entred
into the minds of two Parlaments, solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to have raised this doubt, whether a
Judgment given in a case of Treason by
the Temporal Lords without the Assent
of the Bishops were valid, and to have
determin'd that it was not; when yet
there was no manner of reason to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that the Bishops ever had any Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
in such Cases, nay, when there
was an immemorial Custome and Usage
to the contrary, namely, that the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Lords had in all times exercised
this Jurisdiction alone, and the Bishops
had been excluded from any share in
it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:62146:47"/>
And in the <hi>Apology</hi> of <hi>Adam D'Orleton,
Bishop</hi> of <hi>Hereford,</hi> and after of <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
for his imprisoning <hi>R. de Baldock,</hi>
a great Confident of <hi>Hugh Despencer</hi>'s, he
declares, that the reason why he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to <hi>Newgate</hi> was through the violence
of the People; although, saith he, the
<hi>Parlament</hi> then sitting, there was no
cause of fear but Justice would be done.
His words are, <hi>Domino Rege, Praelatis,
Comitibus, ac aliis terrae Optimatibus Lun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doniae
tunc congregatis &amp; praesentibus, pro
Iustitia ibidem in Parlamento convocatis
omnibus exhibenda.</hi> Which shews that
the <hi>Prelats</hi> then did sit in matters of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
in the House of Lords, and in <hi>Cases
Capital;</hi> for this <hi>R. de Baldock</hi> was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned
at <hi>Hereford</hi> for the same Crimes
that <hi>Hugh Despencer</hi> was.</p>
            <p>But the main strength of the Cause is
supposed to lie in the <hi>Precedents</hi> produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
out of the <hi>Rolls of Parlament</hi> from the
4 <hi>Edw. III.</hi> to the 38 <hi>H. VI.</hi> The force of
these <hi>Precedents</hi> will be better understood,
if we consider these things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I. That many of them are meer Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Testimonies. So</hi> 4 Edw. III. <hi>at the
Trial of</hi> Roger Mortimer,<note place="margin">Lett. <hi>p.</hi> 6.</note> 
               <hi>it is said, the</hi>
Earls, Barons and Peers of the Realm
were present, therefore the Bishops were not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

5 Edw. III. onely the Great ones returned,<note place="margin">pag. 8, 9.</note>
therefore the Bishops did not. <hi>So in the
Case of Sir</hi> Iohn Grey. <hi>From whence he
inferrs,</hi> that the Bishops were not to Iudge
so much as of a Battery.<note place="margin">pag. 10.</note> 25 Edw. III. <hi>in
Sir</hi> William Thorp's <hi>Case,</hi> the Grantz de

not the Bishops.<note place="margin">pag. 13.</note> 1 R. II. <hi>in the Case
of</hi> Weston <hi>and</hi> Gomenitz, the Bishops not

               <hi>Sir</hi> Ralph de Ferrer's <hi>Case
4</hi> R. II. the Bishops not present, because not
comprised under les Seigneurs de Parlament.
<hi>The like in Sir</hi> Iohn Oldcastle'<hi>s Case
5</hi> H. V.<note place="margin">pag. 37.</note> 
               <hi>The</hi> Question, <hi>he saith, is,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Bishops be comprehended under les
Seigneurs de cest present Parlament. <hi>In
the</hi> Earl <hi>of</hi> Devonshire'<hi>s Case</hi> 31 H. VI. <hi>the
strength lies in this,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 51.</note> that the Peers are
onely mention'd; and he supposes no man
will say, the Bishops were his Peers or
Lords of the Realm. <hi>So that here are
Eight</hi> Precedents, <hi>that are no more then</hi>
Negative Testimonies: <hi>concerning which
in general,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jurisdiction of the House of Peers as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted, <hi>p.</hi> 91.</note> 
               <hi>the</hi> Authour <hi>of</hi> the Iurisdiction
of the House of Peers asserted <hi>hath a good
observation; viz.</hi> That one, or two, or
twenty Precedents in the Negative, nay,
I say more, were the number equal as many
in the Negative as in the Affirmative, yet
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62146:48"/>
it could not disprove their Iurisdiction: it
would onely shew, their Lordships were free
Agents, to doe it, or not to doe it, as they
saw Cause; but their Iurisdiction remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
entire still, to doe it whensoever they
would. <hi>So I say here; supposing that the</hi>
Spiritual Lords <hi>were not present in these
Cases, it onely shews, that they were</hi>
free Agents, <hi>and might withdraw at some
times, and be present at others: which
cannot overthrow their</hi> Right, <hi>for these
Reasons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(1.) Several of his <hi>Negative Precedents,</hi>
if they prove any thing, prove the <hi>Bishops</hi>
were not there, when he confesses they
might have been there. As,</p>
            <p>1. In <hi>Cases</hi> of <hi>Misdemeanours.</hi> At the

               <note place="margin">Lett. <hi>pag.</hi> 11.</note> 42 <hi>Ed. III.</hi> being

before the <hi>King, Prelats,</hi> and the <hi>Lords.</hi>
Here he yields the <hi>Prelats</hi> were <hi>Iudges</hi> of
<hi>Misdemeanours</hi> together with other
Lords. And yet if several of his <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Precedents</hi> do prove any thing, they
prove too much, <hi>viz. that the <hi>Bishops</hi>
ought not to be present at the <hi>Trial</hi> of Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours:
For,</hi> he saith, <hi>the Bishops
were not present at the Trial of Weston and
Gomenitz, 1 R. II. nor at the Trial of the
Bishop of Norwich 7 R. II.</hi> nor at such
<hi>Iudgments</hi> as that of Sir <hi>William de Thorp
25 Edw. III.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lett. <hi>p.</hi> 10.</note> 
               <hi>who was condemned for Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery:</hi>
and yet he yields they were at the
Trial of <hi>Mich. de la Pool 10 R. II.</hi> But
if they ought not to be present at those
of 25 <hi>Ed. III.</hi> and 1 <hi>R. II.</hi> and 7 <hi>R. II.</hi>
neither ought they to have been present
at the Trial of <hi>Mich. de la Pool.</hi> Either
therefore his argument doth not prove
they were not present at the former, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
onely from <hi>general words;</hi> or they
ought not to have been present at the
latter, which he confesses they were.
This will best appear by comparing the
Cases together. 1 <hi>R. II.</hi> the <hi>Commons</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:62146:49"/>
deliver in a <hi>Schedule</hi> to the <hi>Lords</hi> of their
Demands, before they would proceed to
a <hi>Subsidy;</hi> among which one was, <hi>That
all such who without cause had lost or given
up any Castle, or Town, or Fortress, to the
dishonour of the King, or dammage of the
People, may be put to their Answer before
the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> that Parlament.</hi>
Here was no particular Impeachment of
these Persons; but upon this the Lords
sent for these two Persons who were Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners
in the Tower upon this account;
and the Charge against them was, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
two Towns in <hi>Flanders</hi> without
Commission. <hi>Weston</hi> made a long and
plausible Defence, to which no Answer
was given; yet both were condemned to
die.<note place="margin">pag. 17.</note> The <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Norwich was charged
with several Miscarriages</hi> and <hi>Misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,</hi>
saith he: why might not the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
be present at this <hi>Trial?</hi> To that
he saith, <hi>he was charged with one Capital
Crime,</hi> viz. <hi>betraying</hi> Graveling <hi>to the
French:</hi> but he confesseth, <hi>he cleared
himself of this, before they came to Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
and yet he would have the <hi>Bishops</hi>
excluded at this <hi>Iudgment;</hi> and that of
Sir <hi>William Elmham,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Trivet,</hi>
and others; but confesses they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at the <hi>Trial</hi> and <hi>Iudgment of Mich.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62146:49"/>
de la Pool.</hi> Let us then see, what kind
of Trial this was. He was impeached in
the name of the <hi>Commons of England,</hi> and
6 <hi>Articles</hi> were exhibited against him.
The main were, <hi>concerning defrauding the
King, and misimploying the Aids granted
to the King last Parlament, whereby much
mischief happen'd to the Kingdom:</hi> as may
appear by the <hi>Rolls,</hi> and the <hi>Articles</hi>
printed in <hi>Knighton.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Knighton</hi> de Event. p. 2684.</note> Upon these Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
the Record saith that the <hi>Commons</hi>
prayed <hi>that Iudgment of Death might pass
upon him, as it did upon Sir</hi> William de
Thorp <hi>for receiving 20 li. by way of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery.</hi>
And yet this <hi>Iudgment</hi> of Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
de Thorp</hi> is one of the <hi>Precedents</hi>
against the Bishops being present; when
he allows that they were present at the
whole Trial of this <hi>Mich. de la Pool,</hi>
when a great <hi>Minister of State</hi> was so hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
charged by the <hi>Commons,</hi> for offences
of so great a nature, and which in their
Judgment <hi>deserved no less then Death.</hi>
From whence it follows, by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
that the <hi>Bishops</hi> may be present,

2. In <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Attainder,</hi> when the
Houses proceed in a <hi>Legislative way,</hi> he
grants <hi>the Bishops may be present;</hi> and
yet if some of his <hi>Precedents</hi> signifie any
thing, they prove they ought not to be
present at the passing of them. As,</p>
            <p>1. In the Case of <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> and
others accused and tried in Parlament
4 <hi>Ed. III.</hi> He confesseth the <hi>Roll</hi> cannot
be read,<note place="margin">Lett. <hi>pag.</hi> 6.</note> and therefore referrs to 28 <hi>Ed. III.</hi>
where <hi>Roger of Wigmore</hi> desires <hi>that the
Attainder may be examin'd:</hi> which was
reversed by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parlament,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we may justly suppose the <hi>Iudgment</hi>
given against him was ratified in <hi>Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cestrens.</hi> l. 7. c. 44. <hi>Knighton,</hi> p. 2558.</note>
And some of our <hi>Historians</hi> say,
he was condemned <hi>judicio Parlamenti.</hi>
And in the <hi>Petition</hi> of <hi>Roger Wigmore,</hi>
he prays <hi>that the said Statute and Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may be reversed and annulled.</hi> If
therefore the <hi>Prelats</hi> could not be present
here, then they are not to be present in
the <hi>Legislative way:</hi> If they were present
in Acts of <hi>Attainder,</hi> then this general
<hi>Negative</hi> way of arguing proves nothing;
for then the <hi>Bishops</hi> were comprehended
under the name of <hi>Peers:</hi> which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Reason, he saith, <hi>the Bishops can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pretend to be;</hi> when it is notorious
that they challenged it in <hi>Parlament
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62146:50"/>
11 R. II.</hi> and it was then allowed, as well
as their <hi>Protestation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>In the case of the Murther of</hi> Iohn
Imperial,<note place="margin">pag. 15.</note> 3 R. II. an Act of Parlament
passed to make it Treason: <hi>and he proves</hi>
the Bishops had no Vote in it, nor were
present at the preparing it. <hi>And yet he
confesses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 3. 118.</note> that the Bishops have a right to
sit in all Acts of Attainder, because they
sit then in their Legislative capacity.
<hi>Therefore these</hi> Negative Precedents <hi>prove
nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2.) The insufficiency of these <hi>Negative
Precedents</hi> appears by this, that we can
make it appear by good Testimonies,
that the Bishops have been often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
under the general Titles of
<hi>Grantz, Peers,</hi> and <hi>Lords of Parlament,</hi>
without any express mention made of
them.</p>
            <p>And because the great force of many
of his Testimonies lies wholly in this,
that the Bishops are not comprehended
under the names of <hi>Grantz, Seigneurs,</hi>
and <hi>Peers,</hi> I shall endeavour to make it
clear beyond exception, that if the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
must be determined by the general
words, all the advantage lies on the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
side.</p>
            <p>It is certain that in elder times the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62146:51"/>
               <hi>Baronagium Anglie</hi> did take in all the
<hi>Lords</hi> of <hi>Parlament,</hi> both <hi>Spiritual</hi> and
<hi>Temporal.</hi> But I betake my self to the
expressions used in the <hi>Records;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the matter of the debate is confined
within the times of <hi>Ed. II.</hi> and IV. I shall
take notice of the language of Parlament
within that time; reserving that of their
<hi>Peerage</hi> to the proper place for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I begin, as the</hi> Authour <hi>of the</hi> Letter
<hi>doth, with</hi> 4 Edw. III. <hi>and in that year</hi>
n. 6. <hi>the Record runs thus; <hi>Et est assen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu
&amp; accorde per nostre Seigneur le Roi,
&amp; tout le Grantz en plcyn Parlement:
where a Law was passed concerning Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
by</hi> Peers; <hi>and in the passing of a Law
our Authour allows</hi> the Bishops to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
<hi>But it is more plain</hi> n. 12. <hi>Accorde
per nostre Seigneur le Roi, &amp; les Grantz
de mesinme le Parlement;</hi> It is agreed by
the King, and the Great ones in Parlament.
<hi>But that the</hi> Bishops <hi>are comprehended
under theseGrantzis evident; for it is
there said,</hi> that the Petitions of Edmund
Earl of Kent and Margaret Countess of
Kent, <hi>to which that Agreement referrs,</hi>
were read before the King, the Prelats,
the Counts, the Barons, and other <hi>Grantz</hi>
of the Parlament. <hi>In the same year,</hi> n. 14.
<hi>we meet with <hi>les Preres des Prielatz &amp;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62146:51"/>
autres Grantz,</hi>
                  </hi> the Petition of the Bishops
and other Great men: <hi>and then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<hi>Nostre Seigneur le Roi en pleyn
Parlement, per assent, accord, prieres &amp;
conseal des ditz Prelatz &amp; autres Grantz;</hi>
                  </hi>
Our Lord the King in full Parlament, by
the assent, accord, petition and advice of
the said Prelats and other <hi>Grantz. Which
shews that they are some of the <hi>Grantz</hi>
of Parlament.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>5 <hi>Ed. III. n. 3. Touz les Prelatz &amp;
autres Grantz: n. 13. Grantz</hi> in general
is used in the Debate between the <hi>Abbot</hi>
of <hi>Crowland</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Wake:</hi> and
<hi>n. 15. le Roi &amp; as autres Grantz en pleyn
Parlement: n. 16. Item fu accorde per
le Roi &amp; touz le Grantz en mesme le Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement,
auxibien per Prelatz come per
autres;It was agreed by the King and
the Great men of the Parlament, as well by
the Prelats as others.</hi> Nothing can be
plainer then that here the Bishops are
called <hi>Grantz,</hi> as well as the other Lords
of Parlament.</p>
            <p>6 <hi>Ed. III. n. 1. Devant nostre Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neur
le Roi, &amp; touz le Prelatz, &amp; autres
Grantz: The Articles were read before the
King, the Prelats, and other Great men.</hi>
If the Bishops had not been comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
under <hi>Grantz,</hi> the Record would
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62146:52"/>
have onely used <hi>Grantz,</hi> and not <hi>autres
Grantz.</hi> But the same expression is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
used <hi>n.</hi> 5. In the second part of the
<hi>Rolls</hi> of that year, <hi>n.</hi> 1. we find three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ways of expressing the Persons then
present: the first, <hi>les Prelatz, Countes,
Baronns, &amp; autres Grantz du Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
the next is, <hi>queux Prelatz, &amp;
autres Grantz;</hi> the third is, <hi>touz le
Grantz en mesme le Parlement:</hi> and
all these are used to express the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
And again <hi>n. 3. touz les Grantz
du dit Parlement;</hi> which are there op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to <hi>Chivalers des Countez;</hi> and
are more distinctly mention'd before in
these words, <hi>les ditz Prelatz, Countes,
Barouns, &amp; autres Grantz, &amp; les Chiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
des Countes, &amp; tote la Conumune.</hi>
Sometimes the <hi>Grantz</hi> are taken in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
for all of the House of Peers; and
the <hi>Commons</hi> for the Lower House. So
21 <hi>Ed.</hi> III. <hi>n. 63. il assentuz per lui, les
Grantz, &amp; la dit Comunalte a son Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement:</hi>
and again, <hi>ditz Grantz &amp; de
tote la Com<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e susditz:</hi> and, <hi>le Roi per
assent des Grantz commanda a la ditz
Com<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e.</hi> From these examples, and many
more which might, if it were needfull,
be produced, it evidently appears that
the Bishops were <hi>Grantz</hi> in Parlament,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62146:52"/>
according to the language of that Time:
and therefore the <hi>Precedents</hi> produced
wherein onely the <hi>Grantz</hi> are mention'd,
are of no force at all against the Presence
of the Bishops. And that Assertion of
the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Peerage,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> appears
to be without any ground, <hi>viz. that the
Bishops are never spoken of in any Record
but by the name of Bishops or Prelats, or
some such name, to distinguish them from
the Laiety.</hi> These general Negatives are
very bold and dangerous things; and one
Affirmative overthrows them. But I
have produced many Instances to the
contrary, and might do many more. Such
men who dare venture upon such bold
Sayings, must be presumed to have read
over all the Records themselves; and
must presume that none else ever so much
as looked into them. But that <hi>Authour</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
too much his <hi>Second-hand</hi> Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in these matters; and we might have
wanted several of his <hi>Precedents,</hi> had it
not been for Mr. <hi>Selden's Baronage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Title of <hi>Seigneurs du Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rights of the Bishops, <hi>p. 56, 57, &amp;c.</hi>
               </note>
being common to the <hi>Bishops,</hi> I
am prevented by another hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I shall onely adde two Precedents
more, not taken notice of by others. The
one</hi> 7 R. II. <hi>The Answer of</hi> Mich. de la
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62146:53"/>
Pole <hi>is said to becoram Magnatibus &amp;
Communitate in Parlamento;where
the</hi> Authour <hi>of the</hi> Letter <hi>confesseth</hi> the
Bishops were present, <hi>and therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
under theMagnates. The
other</hi> 15 H. VI. One <hi>Philipps</hi> complained
against the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> to the House
of Commons: they sent the Complaint up to
the Lords: the Bishop asks the Advice of
the House; who gave this Answer, <hi>Non
consentancum fuit aliquem Procerum
alicui in eo loco responsurum. Which
had signified nothing, if the Bishops
had not been allowed to be</hi> Proceres Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni.
<hi>So much for his</hi> Negative Precedents.</p>
            <p>II. Some of his <hi>Precedents</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
in Parlament to be irregular and
erroneous in other respects; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is no wonder if they should be so
in this.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Iudgment</hi> upon <hi>Roger Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
Earl of <hi>March, 4 Ed.</hi> III. was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
in Parlament 28 <hi>Ed. III</hi> as <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
and erroneous</hi> in all points; being
without any <hi>Proof or Witnesses,</hi> or bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Person to answer for himself.</hi> And
therefore it was an Honour for the <hi>Bishops</hi>
not to be present.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The</hi> Iudgment <hi>upon</hi> Haxey,<note place="margin">Lett. p. 24.</note>
20 R. II. <hi>is confessed by the</hi> Authour <hi>to be</hi>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:62146:53"/>
most unjust, and would not onely have
shaken, but wholly destroyed the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Parlament; and reversed 1 <hi>H.</hi> IV.
as against Right and Course of Parlaments.
<hi>And he confesseth</hi> the Bishops were present
at condemning it, but not at passing it.
<hi>Which also makes much for their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. Some of his <hi>Precedents</hi> prove
that when the <hi>Bishops</hi> did withdraw, they
did it <hi>voluntarily,</hi> and took care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
their <hi>Right,</hi> either by <hi>Protestation,</hi>
or appointing a <hi>Proxy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[1.] <hi>That they withdrew</hi> voluntarily.
<hi>So</hi> 5 Ed. III. <hi>it is said,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lett. <hi>p.</hi> 8.</note> that the Bishops did
withdraw at that time, being of opinion
that it did not properly belong to them to
give Counsel about keeping the Peace, and
punishing of Malefactours: <hi>and so, saith
he,</hi> they went away by themselves, and
returned no more. <hi>But although this
proves nothing but a</hi> voluntary Act <hi>of the</hi>
Bishops <hi>in</hi> withdrawing; <hi>yet the represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
made of this matter is so partial,
and different from the</hi> Record, <hi>that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but take a little more notice of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. He saith, <hi>that the Prelats being of
opinion that it belonged not properly to them
to give Counsel about keeping the Peace, or
punishing such evils, they went away by
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62146:54"/>
themselves, and returned no more.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
insinuating, that they looked on this
matter as wholly unfit for them to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
in, and thereupon left the House.
Whereas the words of the Record are,
<hi>Si alerent mesmes les Prelatz &amp; les
Procurators de la Clergie per eux
mesmes a conseiler de choses susdites, &amp;
les ditz Countes, Barons &amp; autres
Grantz per eux mesmes: So the Prelats
and Proctors of the Clergy went by
themselves toconsult about the aforesaid
matters, and the Earls, Barons and
other Great men by themselves.</hi> So that
this withdrawing was but into several
<hi>Committees,</hi> as was usual at that time, by
which the sense of the 3 <hi>Estates</hi> was best
understood; and then they met together,
and agreed upon what was fit to be made
a Law. This appears by 6 <hi>Edw. III
A quen jour de Ioedi eu ont trete &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation,
cest assavoir les ditz Prelats
per eux mesmes, &amp; les ditz Countes,
Barons, &amp; autres Grantz, per eux
mesmes; &amp; auxint les Chivalers des
Countes per eux mesmes: Upon which
Thursday they enter'd upon debate,</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the News from <hi>Scotland) the
Prelats by themselves, the Lords and other
Great men by themselves; and so the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62146:54"/>
Knights of Counties by themselves.</hi> The
Houses being then not wholly separate,
nor always together; but dividing into
<hi>Committees,</hi> and not into <hi>Houses,</hi> as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
required; and then joyning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to express their common Sense. So
40 <hi>Ed. III.</hi> when the occasion of their
meeting was deliver'd, which was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
message from <hi>Rome,</hi> the
Pope sending for <hi>Tribute</hi> and <hi>Homage,</hi> it
is said, <hi>the Bishops went by themselves, and
the other Lords by themselves, and the
Commons by themselves;</hi> and then met
together, and declared their unanimous
resolution to oppose to the uttermost any
such Demand. Such a withdrawing of
the <hi>Bishops</hi> it was in this case. For they
and the <hi>Proctors of the Clergy</hi> (whether
by them we understand the <hi>Procuratores
Cleri,</hi> who, according to the <hi>Modus te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nendi
Parlamentum,</hi> made a <hi>part of the
Parlament;</hi> or the <hi>Proxies</hi> of the <hi>absent
Bishops,</hi> who were allowed to supply
their places, as appears by 35 <hi>Ed. I.</hi> and
the Case of the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> and
<hi>Carlile</hi> in the <hi>Parlament</hi> at <hi>Westminster
Ed.</hi> II. and 17 <hi>R.</hi> II. and many other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
afterwards) thought fit to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in this matter what was <hi>most proper</hi>
for them. And accordingly we find
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62146:55"/>
               <hi>Ecclesiastical Censures</hi> added to the <hi>Civil
Sanctions,</hi> and brought in by the <hi>Prelats</hi>
at that time, which are still extant in the
<hi>Record.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Whereas he saith,</hi> the Bishops retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
no more, <hi>the</hi> Record <hi>saith the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
For it expresly saith,</hi> that the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
for keeping of the Peace agreed on by
the Committee of Lords were read before the
King, the Bishops, the Knights of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and the Commons, and did please
them all; <hi>&amp; per nostre Seigneur le Roi,
Prelatz, Countes, Baronns, &amp; autres
Grantz, &amp; auxint per les Chivalers de
Countez &amp; gentz de Commun, furent
pleynment assentuz &amp; accordez. And the
same is immediately said of the</hi> Censures
<hi>brought in by the</hi> Bishops. <hi>Which made
me extremely wonder at his saying</hi> that
the Bishops returned no more; <hi>whereas it
is very plain, they did not onely</hi> return,
<hi>but the</hi> Orders <hi>were read before them,
and they did give their</hi> assent <hi>to the</hi> Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<hi>of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Parlament 11 R.</hi> II. that it was
onely a <hi>voluntary withdrawing,</hi> I prove
from the concessions of the <hi>Authour</hi> of
the <hi>Letter; viz. that they might be present
in all Acts of Attainder.</hi> For it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from the <hi>printed Statutes,</hi> that they
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62146:55"/>
proceeded by way of <hi>Attainder</hi> against
the <hi>Ministers of State;</hi> and therefore they
might have been present, if they pleased,
upon the <hi>Authour's</hi> own grounds. How
is it then possible for him to understand
<hi>de Iure non possumus, in their Protestation</hi>
11 <hi>R.</hi> II. of the <hi>Law of the Land,</hi> when
he grants that in all <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Attainder,</hi>
they may <hi>de jure</hi> be present and give
their Votes?</p>
            <p>[2.] When they did solemnly withdraw,
they took care to preserve their Right
two ways; (1.) by <hi>Protestation,</hi> (2.) by
<hi>Proxie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. By <hi>Protestation,</hi> saving their <hi>Right;</hi>
which was receiv'd by the <hi>House,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd:<note place="margin">pag. 24.</note>
of which before. The late <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour</hi>
of the <hi>Peerage and Iurisdiction of
the Lords Spiritual</hi> will not allow the
<hi>Protestation</hi> to be an argument of any
<hi>Right; neither,</hi> saith he, <hi>doth the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
or allowance of any Protestation
yield the Right which the Protester is desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to save, but onely saves the Right
which he had before, if he had any.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi> makes it as
good as a <hi>Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lett. <hi>p.</hi> 23.</note> being entred in the <hi>Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal-Book,</hi>
that such a thing was agreed
<hi>by the King and the two Houses.</hi> I will
not deny that the former <hi>Authour</hi> speaks
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62146:56"/>
more reasonably in this matter, when he
saith, <hi>that the utmost a Protestation can
doe is, to anticipate a Conclusion,</hi> or <hi>Estop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell;</hi>
i.e. <hi>to provide that the doing of any
such Act as is contained in the Protestation,
shall not be construed to the prejudice of the
Party, so as to bar or conclude him from
claiming afterwards that which in truth is
his Right.</hi> It is true, this <hi>Protestation</hi> pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with greater solemnity then usually;
for it was <hi>with the consent of the King
and both Houses:</hi> but however it retained
the nature of a <hi>Protestation.</hi> And there
was no distinction at that time between a
<hi>Iournal-Book</hi> and the <hi>Rolls of Parlament.</hi>
For a good Authour assures us,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Selden</hi>'s Bar. pag. 6.</note> 
               <hi>the Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
of the Vpper House began 1 H.</hi> VIII.
and therefore the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rights of the Bishops, <hi>pag.</hi> 76.</note>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> deserved no such severe reproof
on that account. But this is all I plead
for, <hi>viz.</hi> that this <hi>Protestation</hi> was a <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo</hi>
to their Right; which meeting with
no contest or opposition in the <hi>Houses,</hi>
but passing with unanimous consent, is a
certain argument the <hi>Houses</hi> did not think
there was any Law to exclude them.
And therefore the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Iudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
very well saith, <hi>That had it not been
for the Canon-Law,</hi> (for which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs
to the <hi>Synodal Constitutions</hi> at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:62146:56"/>
21 <hi>H.</hi> II. which is onely reviving
the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Toledo's Canon,) they might
have been present both by Common Law,
and by the Law of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. By <hi>Proxie,</hi> or one <hi>common Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator</hi>
to appear in Parlament for them,
and to vote in the name of the whole
Body. This was receiv'd and allow'd
21 <hi>R. II.</hi> upon the <hi>Petition</hi> of the <hi>House
of Commons, because Iudgments had been
reversed without their concurrence.</hi> Against
this the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi> objects ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things which are easily answer'd.</p>
            <p>1. That <hi>hence it appears they could not
be personally present.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lett. <hi>p.</hi> 28.</note> On the contrary,
from hence it follows they had a <hi>Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
Right</hi> to be present; although
they said by <hi>Canon-Law they could not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>That it was never practised but in
this one Parlament.</hi> That is strange, when
himself confesseth, that it passed for good
Law 10 <hi>Ed.</hi> IV. <hi>Term. Pasch. n.</hi> 35. and
the same is cited by <hi>Stamford Placit. Cor.</hi>
l. 3. f. 153.<note place="margin">pag. 78.</note> To which judgment of the
<hi>Lawyers,</hi> and the greatest of their time,
(for <hi>Littleton</hi> was then Judge 10 <hi>Ed. IV.)</hi>
we have a very extraordinary Answer
called <hi>Error Temporis;</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 79.</note> which will equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make void the <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Iudgment</hi> of any
<hi>Age.</hi> But is it possible, that should pass
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62146:57"/>
for <hi>Law 10 Ed.</hi> IV. which was never prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
but once 21 <hi>R. II.</hi> and the contrary
practice had been onely allowed all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate
times? Thus a short answer
may be given to the <hi>Constitution</hi> of <hi>Claren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
it was <hi>Error Temporis;</hi> to the <hi>allowing
the Protestation 11 R.</hi> II. it was <hi>Error Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris;</hi>
and so on to the end of the <hi>Chapter.</hi>
If there were any <hi>Error Temporis</hi> in this
matter, it lay in this, that they took this
<hi>Precedent 21 R. II.</hi> for a sufficient Ground,
<hi>that the Bishops should onely appear by Proxy
in such Cases;</hi> whereas the <hi>Canon-Law</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken away since the Reformation as
to these matters, their <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Personal</hi>
appearing doth return to them of course.</p>
            <p>3. That <hi>this Parlament was repealed</hi>
1 <hi>H.</hi> IV.<note place="margin">Lett. <hi>p.</hi> 79.</note> But this I have answer'd already
from his own words, wherein he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
him to be an <hi>Vsurper,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the Repeal not made by a legal
Parlament. And this Repeal was again
taken off 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> IV.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>That it is not at all Parlamentary,
for one or two men to represent a whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi>
The consequence then is, that they
ought to enjoy their own <hi>Personal Right.</hi>
All that we urge from hence is, that the
<hi>Bishops</hi> kept up their <hi>Right</hi> still by their
<hi>Proxies,</hi> when they thought the <hi>Canons</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:62146:57"/>
would not allow voting in their <hi>own
Persons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IV. Some of his <hi>Precedents</hi> do prove,
that after the <hi>Protestations</hi> and <hi>Proxies,</hi>
they did assert their <hi>own Personal Right,</hi>
and were present both at <hi>Examinations,</hi>
and at the <hi>whole Proceedings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>At</hi> Examinations. <hi>As in the Case
of Sir</hi> William Rickill 1 H. IV. <hi>who was
brought to Parlament</hi> before the King and
the two Houses,<note place="margin">Lett. <hi>p.</hi> 31.</note> the Lords Spiritual and
Temporal and the Commons then assembled
together. <hi>And he grants the</hi> Bishops
<hi>were present at his Examination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. At the <hi>whole Proceedings,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 41. to pag. 48.</note> 28 <hi>H. VI.</hi>
where he confesseth <hi>the Bishops were not
onely personally present, but did act and bear
a principal part in aIudicialproceeding in
Parlament, in a Case that was in it self Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital,
viz. of</hi> William de la Pole, <hi>Duke of</hi>
Suffolk. Which is very fully related by
the <hi>Authour,</hi> and needs no repetition.
All that he hath to say to this, is, <hi>that
the whole Proceedings were irregular, and
not to be drawn into Precedent.</hi> Whereas
a great <hi>Lawyer</hi> in his time, Sir <hi>E. C.</hi> made
use of this as a sufficient <hi>Precedent</hi> in a
Case of great moment, <hi>about Commitment
upon a general Accusation.</hi> But there is
not any Irregularity expressed or intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62146:58"/>
in the <hi>Bishops</hi> appearing, and judging
as other Lords did; and the Judgment
was not reversed because of their being
there, as we have shewed others have
been for their being absent.</p>
            <p>V. None of all his <hi>Precedents</hi> do prove
that the <hi>Bishops</hi> were ever excluded from
sitting, by any <hi>Vote</hi> of the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Lords</hi>
or <hi>Commons.</hi> That they might <hi>volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
withdraw,</hi> we deny not; or not <hi>be
present at giving of Iudgment out of regard
to the Canons:</hi> which is all that is proved
by the <hi>Precedent</hi> of <hi>Iohn Hall 1 H. IV.</hi> of
the <hi>Earls</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 32.</note> 
               <hi>Huntington,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 34.</note> &amp;c.
2 <hi>H. IV.</hi> of Sir <hi>Iohn Oldcastle 5 H. V.</hi> and
of Sir <hi>Iohn Mortimer 2 H. VI.</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 37.</note> And this
we have made appear was done by them
out of regard to the <hi>Canon-Law;</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 39.</note> the
force of which being taken away by the
<hi>Reformation,</hi> the <hi>Bishops</hi> are thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to their just <hi>Parlamentary Right.</hi>
Neither can any Disusage be a bar to that
Right, since the ground of that Disusage
was something then supposed to be in
force, which is now removed by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.
And I fear, if this kind of
arguing be sufficient to overthrow the
<hi>Bishops Right,</hi> much stronger of the
same kind may be used to overthrow the
<hi>King's Supremacy</hi> in mattters of Religion.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62146:58"/>
So great care ought men to have, lest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the colour of a mighty zeal against
<hi>Popery,</hi> they do overthrow the very <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
of our <hi>Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VI. There are <hi>Precedents</hi> upon <hi>Record</hi>
in the <hi>Rolls</hi> of <hi>Parlament,</hi> which are not
mention'd by the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter,</hi>
which do prove that the <hi>Bishops</hi> were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at the Examination of <hi>Treason</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
Offences</hi> in <hi>Parlament.</hi> And that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the time,<note place="margin">pag. 5. 51.</note> wherein he pretends to give
an account of <hi>all the Trials recorded in the
Rolls.</hi> Which shews how easily men pass
by those things they have no mind to see.</p>
            <p>I begin with 4 <hi>Ed. III.</hi> and I must doe
him that right, as to say, that he doth
not onely mention the Trial of <hi>Roger
Mortimer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 6.</note> but of Sir <hi>Simon Bereford and
others who were accused and tried in Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
But pretending, <hi>that the Roll of
that Parlament is so defaced that it cannot
be read,</hi> he runs to that of 28 <hi>Ed. III.</hi> and
so gently passes over all <hi>the other Trials</hi>
which are in the <hi>Record,</hi> and are more
plain and express as to this matter. Among
the <hi>Articles</hi> against <hi>Roger Mortimer, Ed. l</hi>
of <hi>March,</hi> one is, <hi>that after he knew cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the death of Edw.</hi> II. <hi>he made use of
Instruments to perswade</hi> Edward <hi>Earl of</hi>
Kent, <hi>that King's Brother, that he was
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62146:59"/>
still living, and so drew him into a design
for his Rescue; for which he was attainted
at</hi> Winchester, <hi>and there suffer'd death for
it.</hi> Among these Instruments the chief
was one <hi>Mautravers,</hi> who for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
was attainted this <hi>Parlament:</hi> and
the words of the Record are,<note place="margin">Rot. Parl. 4 <hi>Ed. 3. n.</hi> 3.</note> 
               <hi>Trestouz

assembled in this present Parlament,
upon strict examination do assent and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
that</hi> John Mautravers <hi>is guilty of
the death of</hi> Edmund <hi>Earl of</hi> Kent. Here
we have the strict Examination of a <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Case</hi> in Parlament, and <hi>all the Peers</hi>
are said to be present at it. It is used as
an argument by the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter,
that in the case of</hi> Roger Mortimer,<note place="margin">pag. 7.</note> 
               <hi>the
Bishops could not be comprized under the
general name of Peers, since the Barons are
first in rank.</hi> But here the <hi>Peers</hi> are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
before <hi>Counts</hi> and <hi>Barons;</hi> and it
will be impossible for him to assign any
other <hi>Peers</hi> at that time, that were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
before them, but the <hi>Prelats;</hi> who
frequently are so put in the Records of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62146:59"/>
that time: as in the same Parlament <hi>n.</hi> 12.
<hi>Prelatz, Countes, Barons;n. 13. Et
per assent des ditz Prelatz, Countes,
Barons;</hi> so again <hi>n.</hi> 14. 15. 17. 24. 25.
But the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi> saith,<note place="margin">pag. 7.</note> 
               <hi>they
cannot pretend to be Peers of the Realm.</hi>
Let him name then other Peers of the
Realm at that time, who were neither
<hi>Counts</hi> nor <hi>Barons,</hi> and were before them.
But if we are to judge who are <hi>Peers</hi> of
the <hi>Realm</hi> by the <hi>Records</hi> of <hi>Parlament,</hi>
I do not question but I shall make it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that the Bishops were so esteemed;
and that some persons, who pretend to
great skill in <hi>Records,</hi> either have not
searched so diligently, or have not obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
so carefully about this matter as they
might have done. But of this afterwards.</p>
            <p>In the same <hi>Parlament</hi> Judgment was
passed upon <hi>Boges de Boyons, Iohn Deveril,
Thomas Gurnay, William Ocle;</hi> but being
by way of <hi>Attainder,</hi> and not upon <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
examination,</hi> which is mentioned in the
case of <hi>Mautravers,</hi> I pass them over.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the Pleas of the Crown held before
the King in this</hi> Parlament, <hi>we find ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Case which relates to our present de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate;</hi>
viz. <hi>of</hi> Thomas Lord Berkely <hi>and</hi>
Knight, <hi>who was arraigned for the</hi> death
of King Ed. II. who came before the King
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62146:60"/>
               <hi>in pleno Parlamento,</hi> in full Parlament,
<hi>and there pleaded</hi> Not guilty; and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
he was ready to clear himself as the
King's Court should advise. Then they
proceeded to particular examination of him,
how he could acquitt himself, being Lord of
the Castle where the King was murthered,
he being committed to his Custody and
<hi>John Matravers.</hi> He pleaded for himself,
that he was then sick at <hi>Bradley,</hi> and knew
nothing of it. They charged him, that the
Keepers of the Castle were of his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing;
and therefore he was bound to
answer for them. He answer'd, that they
with <hi>Matravers</hi> having receiv'd the King
into their custody, he was not to be blamed
for what they did: and for this he put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon his Country. At the day appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for his Trial, he appears <hi>again coram
Domino Rege in pleno Parlamento;</hi>
and the Iury returned him Not guilty. But
because he appointed <hi>Gurney</hi> and <hi>Ocle</hi> to
keep his Castle of <hi>Berkely,</hi> by whom the
King was murthered, the King appoints
him a day the next Parlament to hear his
Sentence; and in the mean time he was
committed to the custody of <hi>Ralph Nevil</hi>
Steward of the King's House. <hi>In the
next Parlament</hi> 5 Edw. III. n. 18. The
Prelats, Earls and Barons petition the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62146:60"/>
King, that he might be discharged of his
mainprisors: the which was granted, and
a farther day given him to appear next
Parlament. <hi>But we reade no more of
him, till the Summons he had</hi> 14 Ed. III.
<hi>as one of the</hi> Lords in Parlament. <hi>The
great force of this</hi> Precedent <hi>lies in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
what is meant by appearing
before the King</hi> in full Parlament. <hi>If
under this the</hi> Bishops <hi>be comprehended,
then this will be an uncontroulable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
of the presence of the</hi> Bishops <hi>in
the Examination of a</hi> Case Capital.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What the importance of this phrase of</hi>
full Parlament <hi>is, will best appear by the
use of it in the</hi> Records <hi>of that time.</hi>

per nostre Seigneur le Roi, &amp; touz les
Grantz en pleyn Parlement. Where it
was agreed,</hi> that the procedings at that
time by the Lords against those who were
not Peers should not be drawn into conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence;
and that the Peers should be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
onely to try Peers. <hi>Which hath all
the formality of an</hi> Act <hi>of</hi> Parlament:
<hi>and therefore</hi> all the Estates were present,

made his Oration <hi>en pleyn Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
which is explained by <hi>en la pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence

in the same number, <hi>viz. les Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latz,
Countes, Baronns, &amp; touz les au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres
somons a mesme le Parlement.</hi>
Which is the clearest explication of <hi>full
Parlament, in the presence of all those who
were summon'd to Parlament.</hi> From
whence it follows, that where a <hi>full
Parlament</hi> was mention'd at that time,
the <hi>Bishops</hi> were certainly present; and
consequently did assist at the Trial of
<hi>Thomas Lord Berkely,</hi> who appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>King in full Parlament:</hi> as
<hi>Nich. de Segrave</hi> did 33 <hi>Ed. I.</hi> and there
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62146:61"/>
the <hi>Bishops</hi> are expresly mention'd as <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;</hi>
as appears by what hath been said
before concerning his Case.</p>
            <p>5 <hi>H. IV. Henry Hotspur,</hi> Son to the
<hi>Earl of Northumberland,</hi> was declared a
<hi>Traitour</hi> by the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Lords in full
Parlament;</hi> and the same day, the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
was, upon examination, <hi>acquitted of
Treason by the Peers.</hi> It is not said that
this was done <hi>in full Parlament,</hi> as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was: but there are several circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
which make it very probable the
<hi>Bishops</hi> were then present. (1.) When
the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Northumberland</hi> took his
<hi>Oath of Fidelity to the King, he did it,</hi>
saith the Record, <hi>upon the Cross of the
Archbishop;</hi> which was to be carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, if he went out of the House.
(2.) The <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury pray'd
the King, that forasmuch as himself and
other Bishops were suspected to be in</hi> Pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie's
<hi>Conspiracy, that the Earl might upon
his Oath declare the truth:</hi> who thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
did clear them all. Which shews that
the <hi>Archbishop</hi> was then present in the
House. And for the same reason that he
was present, we may justly suppose the
other <hi>Bishops</hi> to have been so too.
(3.) The <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Northumberland besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
the Lords and Earls and Commoners,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62146:62"/>
that if he brake this Oath, they would inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
no more with the King for him.</hi>
Now the better to understand this, we
are to consider, that <hi>H.</hi> IV. takes notice
in his declaration upon the <hi>Rebellion</hi> of
Sir <hi>Henry Piercy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Walsingh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> hist. Angl. pag. 366.</note> that <hi>the Earl of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland
and his Son gave out, that
they could have no access to the King, but
by the Mediation of the Bishops and Earls,
and therefore did beseech them to intercede
with the King for them.</hi> It is not then
probable, that those should be now left
out, when the words are <hi>large enough</hi> to
comprehend them, and no one circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
is brought to exclude them. For
that general one, of <hi>their not being Peers,</hi>
will be fully refuted afterwards.</p>
            <p>But that which puts this out of dispute
is, (4.) that the Record saith, <hi>n.</hi> 17. the
Commons not onely gave the King thanks
for the pardon of the Earl of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
but the Lords Spiritual and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
in these remarkable words; <hi>Et au<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:62146:62"/>
in this case <hi>as Peers of Parlament.</hi>
Which is a clear Precedent of the Bishops
judging in a Capital Case, and that as <hi>Peers.</hi>

            <head type="sub">The Peerage of the Bishops cleared; how
far they make a third Estate in Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Objections against it answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</head>
            <p>THERE remain <hi>Two</hi> things to be
considered, which are put in by
way of <hi>Postscript</hi> by the <hi>Authour</hi> of the
<hi>Letter:</hi> the one concerns the <hi>Peerage</hi>
of the <hi>Bishops,</hi> the other their Being a
<hi>Third Estate</hi> in Parlament.</p>
            <p>1. Concerning their <hi>Peerage.</hi> To
prove this <hi>two Statutes</hi> had been alledged,
25 <hi>Ed. III. c.</hi> 6. and 4 <hi>H. V. c.</hi> 6. and the
opinion of <hi>Iudges</hi> and <hi>Lawyers</hi> out of the
<hi>Year-Books.</hi> But although these had
been very significant, if they had been
against them; they have the hard fortune
to signify nothing, when they are for
them. A meer <hi>Protestation</hi> becomes <hi>good
Law, very substantial Law,</hi> if it be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to make against the <hi>Bishops;</hi> and
yet in <hi>that very Protestation</hi> the <hi>Right of
Peerage</hi> is expresly challenged, (as well
as it is asserted and taken for granted in
the <hi>Statutes</hi> mention'd.) Is that part of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62146:64"/>
the <hi>Protestation invalid?</hi> and must no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
pass for <hi>Law</hi> but what is against
them? Is it credible that a <hi>Right of Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage</hi>
should be owned and received in
<hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parlament,</hi> in <hi>Protestations,</hi> in
<hi>Year-Books,</hi> time after time; and no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
made against it by the <hi>Temporal
Lords</hi> all that time, in case they believed
the <hi>Bishops</hi> had challenged that which by
no means did belong to them? Did not
the <hi>Temporal Lords</hi> understand their own
<hi>Privileges?</hi> or were they willing to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the <hi>Bishops</hi> to assume their <hi>Titles</hi> to
themselves without the least check or
contradiction, and let their <hi>Protestations</hi>
be enter'd in the <hi>Rolls</hi> of <hi>Parlament</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any contrary <hi>Protestation?</hi> I do
not question but the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
did reade the <hi>Bishops Protestation</hi> at
large in the <hi>Parlament-Rolls 11 R. II.</hi>
And can any thing be plainer, then that
therein they challenge a <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Peerage</hi>
to themselves, <hi>ut Pares Regni—cum
caeteris Regni Paribus, &amp;c.?</hi> And this
<hi>Protestation,</hi> he saith, <hi>was enter'd by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the King, Lords Temporal,</hi> and
<hi>Commons;</hi> as is expressed in the <hi>Rolls.</hi>
Were the <hi>Temporal Lords</hi> awake? or
were they mean and low-spirited men?
No; they were never higher then at this
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62146:64"/>
time, when the <hi>King</hi> himself durst not
withstand them. What could it be then,
but meer conviction of their just <hi>Right</hi> of
<hi>Peerage,</hi> which made them suffer such a
<hi>Protestation</hi> as that to pass, after so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
and unusual a manner, and to be
enrolled <hi>par Commandment du Roy,
&amp; assent des Seigneurs Temporels &amp;
Communs;</hi> as it is in the <hi>Rolls?</hi> Was
all this onely <hi>a Complement to the Potent
Clergy at that time?</hi> But who can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that <hi>King, Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi>
should complement at that rate, as to
suffer the <hi>Bishops</hi> to challenge a <hi>Peerage</hi>
to themselves in <hi>Parlament,</hi> if they had
not an undoubted Right to it? This
<hi>one argument</hi> is sufficient to convince any
reasonable man. Especially when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that in the same <hi>Parlament,</hi> before
the <hi>Protestation</hi> was brought in, a moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was made <hi>n.</hi> 7. by all the <hi>Lords Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and Temporal, which they claimed
come leur libertez &amp; franchise, as their
Liberty and Privilege, that all weighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
moved in this Parlament, or to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in any to come, touchant Pieres de
la Terre, concerning the Peers of the
Realm, should be determin'd, adjudged
and discussed by the course of Parlament;
and not by the Civil, nor by the Common
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62146:65"/>
Law of the Land, used in inferiour Courts
of the Realm. The which Claim, Liberty and
Franchise, the King most willingly allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and granted in full Parlament.</hi> From
whence it is evident, that the King and
Parlament did allow the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Peerage</hi>
in the <hi>Lords Spiritual;</hi> for it is said ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
in the Record, <hi>that all the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
as well as Temporal Lords joyned in this
Claim:</hi> which being allowed them in <hi>full
Parlament,</hi> is an evidence beyond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
of their <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Peerage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But against this no less is pretended
then</hi> Magna Charta, viz. <hi>that every man
who is tried at the</hi> King's Suit <hi>must</hi> be
tried by his Peers.<note place="margin">Lett. <hi>pag.</hi> 85.</note> Now if a Bishop be
tried for any Capital offence, he is tried by
the Commoners, and that is the Common Law
of England; it hath ever been so, never
otherwise: then must Commoners be his
<hi>Peers,</hi> and he and Commoners must be
<hi>Pares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this <hi>Argument,</hi> how strong soever
it appears, these <hi>two</hi> things may be justly
answer'd.</p>
            <p>1. That the matter of Fact cannot be
made out, that a <hi>Bishop</hi> hath always been
tried by <hi>Commoners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That if it could, it doth not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
their <hi>Peerage in Parlament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:62146:65"/>
(1.) That the matter of Fact cannot
be made out, <hi>viz. that if a Bishop be tried
for a Capital Offence, he is tried by the
Commoners; that it hath ever been so, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
otherwise.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Antiq. Brit. <hi>pag.</hi> 223.</note> For in 15 <hi>Ed. III. Iohn Strat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,
Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> was at the
<hi>King's Suit</hi> accused of <hi>Capital Crimes,
viz.</hi> of no less then <hi>Treason,</hi> and <hi>Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
with the <hi>French King.</hi> He put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon his <hi>Trial in Parlament.</hi> A <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament</hi>
was called; and he at first refused
admission into the <hi>House;</hi> which he
challenged <hi>tanquam major Par Regni
post Regem, &amp; Uocem primam in Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento
habere debens, as the First Peer
of the Realm after the King, and having
the first Uote in Parlament.</hi> Upon
which, and the intercession of his Friends,
he is admitted into the <hi>House;</hi> and there
he put himself upon the <hi>Triall of his
Peers.</hi> At which time a great Debate
arose in the <hi>House,</hi> which continued a
whole Week; and it was resolved, <hi>that
the Peers should be tried onely by Peers
in Parlament.</hi> Whereupon the <hi>Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
had 12 Peers appointed to examine
the <hi>Articles</hi> against him: 4 Bishops,
<hi>viz. London, Hereford, Bath,</hi> and <hi>Exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi>
4 Earls, <hi>Arundel, Salisbury, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingdon,</hi>
and <hi>Suffolk;</hi> and 4 Barons,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62146:66"/>
               <hi>Percy, Wake, Basset,</hi> and <hi>Nevil.</hi> Here
we have all that can be desired in the
case. Here is a <hi>Bishop</hi> tried at the <hi>King's
Suit,</hi> and for a <hi>Capital Crime;</hi> and yet not
tried by <hi>Commoners,</hi> but by his <hi>Peers,</hi>
and that after long debate in the <hi>House</hi>
concerning it. If it be said, <hi>that he was
tried by the Lords as Iudges in Parlament,
and not as his Peers;</hi> it is answer'd,
1. Then Bishops are <hi>Iudges in Parlament</hi>
in <hi>Cases Capital:</hi> for so this was, and
4 <hi>Bishops</hi> appointed to examine it. 2. The
Debate in the <hi>House</hi> was about <hi>Trial of
Peers by their Peers;</hi> and upon that it
was resolved, that the <hi>Archbishop</hi> should
be tried by the <hi>House.</hi> For the <hi>King</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to have him tried in the <hi>Exchequer</hi>
for the matters objected against him, and
the <hi>Steward</hi> of the <hi>King's House</hi> and <hi>Lord
Chamberlain</hi> would not suffer him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the <hi>House of Lords,</hi> till he had
put in his <hi>Answer</hi> in the <hi>Exchequer.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which the great <hi>Debate</hi> arose; and
therefore the <hi>Resolution</hi> of the <hi>House</hi> is as
full a <hi>Precedent</hi> in this <hi>Case</hi> as can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired.</p>
            <p>I do not deny, that the <hi>Rolls</hi> of <hi>Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of that year seem to represent the
12 Peers, as <hi>Birchington</hi> calls them, not
as appointed to examine the particular
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62146:66"/>
Case of <hi>Stratford;</hi> but to draw up in
form the desire of the Peers as to a Trial
by their Peers, in Parlament: the which
is extant in the <hi>Record 15 Ed. III. n.</hi> 7.
However, this Argument doth not lose
its force as to the Peerage of the Bishops;
but it is rather confirmed by it. For there
they pray the King, by the Assent of the
Prelats, Counts and Barons, that the
Peers of the Realm may not be judged
but in Parlament, <hi>&amp; per lour Piers, and
by their Peers:</hi> and after it follows, <hi>that
they may not lose their Temporalties, Lands,
Goods and Chattels,</hi> &amp;c. Who were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of <hi>losing their Temporalties,</hi> but the
<hi>Prelats?</hi> Therefore this Law must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
them as well as others. As farther
appears not onely by the Occasion, but
by the Consequent of it. For it follows,
<hi>n.</hi> 8. that the <hi>Archbishop of Canterbury was
admitted into the King's Presence, and to
answer for himself in Parlamentdevant les
Piers, before his Peers:</hi> which the King
granted. So that the <hi>Rolls</hi> of <hi>Parlament</hi>
put this matter beyond contradiction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In</hi> 21 R. II. Thomas Arundel, Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<hi>of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>was impeached of</hi>
High Treason <hi>before the</hi> King <hi>and</hi>
Lords in Parlament. <hi>The</hi> King'<hi>s answer
was,</hi> That forasmuch as this Impeachment
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62146:67"/>
did concern so high a Person, <hi>&amp; Pier de
son Roialm,</hi> (<hi>it is in the</hi> Record, <hi>but
left out in the</hi> Abridgment) <hi>and a Peer
of the Realm,</hi> the King would be advised.
<hi>But soon after he was condemned for</hi>
Treason <hi>by the</hi> House, <hi>theProxie of the
Bishops, Sir</hi> Tho. Percy, <hi>giving his</hi> Vote.
<hi>The force of this doth not lie barely in
his being impeached before</hi> the House of
Peers <hi>in time of</hi> Parlament; <hi>but that the</hi>
King <hi>called him in his</hi> Answer <hi>a Peer of
the Realm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And because two Laws were already
passed, the one, <hi>that Peers were to try
none but Peers, 4 Ed. III. n.</hi> 6. the other,
<hi>that Peers were to be tried onely by their
Peers, 15 Ed. III. n.</hi> 7. the former of
these,<note place="margin">pag. 192.</note> the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Iurisdiction of
the House of Peers asserted</hi> (one well
known to the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter)
would have onely looked on as a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
Order of the House.</hi>

                  <hi>Coke</hi> 2. Inst. c. 29. p. 50. Sir <hi>J. M.</hi> Arg. concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Iurisdiction of the Peers, in <hi>Skinners</hi> Case.</note> But our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Lawyers are of another opinion. And
an eminent Lawyer still living urged this
as an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parlament, because it is said,
that the King in full Parlament assented to
it:</hi> and he added, <hi>that the words are both
Affirmative and Negative; they shall not
be bound, or charged to try any other then
Peers, but be thereof discharged; and that
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62146:67"/>
therein they declare it to be against Law
for them to exercise Iurisdiction on those
who were not their Peers.</hi> From whence
it follows, that since <hi>Stratford</hi> and <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,</hi>
Archbishops of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to be tried by the House of <hi>Peers,</hi>
(without Impeachment from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons)
they were looked on as <hi>Peers</hi> by
the whole House.</p>
            <p>The latter Act, the same <hi>Authour</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deny <hi>to be a binding Law;</hi> but he
hath a strange fetch to avoid the force of
it;<note place="margin">pag. 193.</note> 
               <hi>viz. that this Law was made with respect
to the Case of</hi> Roger Mortimer 4 <hi>Ed. III.
and not to the Case of</hi> Stratford <hi>then in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation:</hi>
which is without all colour of
Reason. For the Case then was of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
nature, <hi>viz.</hi> about the <hi>Peers</hi> trying
those who were not <hi>Peers,</hi> as Sir <hi>Simon
Bereford, &amp;c:</hi> but here the case was,
<hi>whether Peers should be tried by any others
then their Peers; and the King granted
they should not.</hi> Now upon this <hi>Stratford</hi>
was allowed to be tried by his <hi>Peers</hi> in
Parlament; and therefore this Trial upon
these Acts is an invincible Argument of
the <hi>Peerage</hi> of the <hi>Bishops.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 28 <hi>H. VI.</hi> when <hi>William de la Pole,
Duke</hi> of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> waved being tried by
his <hi>Peers,</hi> and submitted to the <hi>King's
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62146:68"/>
Mercy;</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 47.</note> the <hi>Record</hi> saith, (as the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour</hi>
of the <hi>Letter</hi> himself confesseth)
that <hi>Viscount</hi> Beaumont, <hi>on the behalf of
the LordsSpiritualand Temporal, and by
their advice, assent and desire,</hi> moved the
<hi>King,</hi> that a <hi>Protestation might be enter'd
in the Parlament-Roll,</hi> that <hi>this should
not be, nor turn in prejudice nor derogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them, their Heirs, ne of their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours
in time coming; but that they may
have and enjoy their Liberties and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
as largely as ever their Ancestours and
Predecessours had or enjoy'd them before this
time.</hi> Which Sir <hi>R. Cotton</hi> more briefly
expresseth, <hi>n. 52. that neither they nor
their Heirs should by this example be barred
of their Peerage.</hi> The <hi>Authour</hi> of the
<hi>Letter</hi> more fully puts in <hi>Successours,</hi>
as well as <hi>Heirs;</hi> for this <hi>Protestation</hi>
was made in behalf of the <hi>Lords Spiritual</hi>
as well as <hi>Temporal.</hi> But very unfairly
leaves out the most material words in the
Record, <hi>viz.</hi> [after <hi>Freedoms,] in case of
their Peerage.</hi> And I appeal to the <hi>Authour</hi>
himself, whether these words be not in
the <hi>Record;</hi> and with what ingenuity
they are left out, I cannot understand.
I do not charge the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi>
himself with this; but whosoever sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
the <hi>Records</hi> for him, hath dealt very
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62146:68"/>
unfaithfully with him. And I suppose,
if he had seen this passage himself, he
would never have so peremptorily deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Peerage</hi> of the Bishops; nor as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
with so much assurance, that they
<hi>are onely to be tried by Commoners, and
that it was always so, and never other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2.) Suppose the <hi>Bishops</hi> have been
tried by <hi>Commoners out of Parlament,</hi> this
doth not take away their <hi>Right of Peerage
in Parlament.</hi> For all our dispute is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Right</hi> of their <hi>Peerage in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament;</hi>
and if that be allowed, we are
not to dispute concerning the difference
that in some respects may arise by Custom,
or practice of Common Law, between
<hi>Peers</hi> by <hi>Descent,</hi> and <hi>Peers</hi> by <hi>Tenure</hi> in
Right of their <hi>Baronies.</hi> And therefore
the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Peerage of the Lords
Spiritual</hi> might have spared all the need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
pains he takes about this:<note place="margin">pag. 3, 4, &amp;c.</note> for we do
not contend that they have an <hi>Inheritable
Peerage,</hi> but that they are <hi>Peers in Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
having a <hi>Right</hi> to sit and judge
there by virtue of their <hi>Baronies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But from hence he undertakes to prove,
<hi>that by Magna Charta they cannot be
Iudges of such who are ennobled in
Bloud.</hi> This comes home to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62146:69"/>
business, and therefore must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.</p>
            <p>1. He saith,<note place="margin">pag. 4.</note> that he who hath onely
a <hi>Praedial</hi> or <hi>Feudal,</hi> and not <hi>Personal,
Peerage, can have no Iurisdiction but such
as is suitable to the nature of his</hi> Peerage;
and therefore can onely <hi>extend to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of property and possession, and not to
matters of Bloud.</hi> But that this is a very
trifling and ill-consider'd argument ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by this, that he grants a <hi>Lord Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
Lord Privy Seal, Lord Treasurer,</hi> to
be <hi>Peers</hi> by their <hi>Offices;</hi> for, as he
speaks, <hi>after Regradation their Peerage is
ended:</hi> and he will not deny that these
may sit as <hi>Iudges</hi> in <hi>Capital Cases,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they be <hi>Peers</hi> onely by their
<hi>Offices.</hi> Those that are <hi>Peers in Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
have <hi>Right</hi> to judge in <hi>all Cases</hi>
that belong to the <hi>Iudicature</hi> of <hi>Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. He saith, that the <hi>Reason</hi> of <hi>Magna
Charta</hi> is,<note place="margin">pag. 5.</note> that the <hi>Iudges</hi> and <hi>Prisoner
may be under the same Circumstances.</hi> But
this kind of arguing as well excludes a
<hi>Lord Keeper,</hi> who is <hi>no Baron,</hi> as a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop;</hi>
and supposes that mens capacity for
Judgment depends upon perfect equality
of Circumstances: whereas <hi>Knowledge</hi>
and <hi>Integrity</hi> go farther towards consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62146:69"/>
one that is a <hi>Peer</hi> but in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
a just Judge, then <hi>bare Inheritance</hi>
of <hi>Honour</hi> can do. But to give a full
Answer to this <hi>Argument,</hi> on which that
<hi>Authour</hi> lays so much weight, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges
any Person, <hi>to give a rational ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
wherein the advantage of a man's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tried by his Peers doth consist;</hi> I shall
(1) shew that this was not the <hi>Reason</hi> of
<hi>Trial by Peers;</hi> (2) give a brief account
of the true and original <hi>Reason</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>[1.] That this was not the <hi>Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Not in the Judgment of the <hi>Peers
themselves,</hi> as that Authour hath himself
sufficiently proved, when he takes so much
pains to prove <hi>p. 3. that a Writ of Summons
to Parlament doth not ennoble the Bloud;</hi>
and consequently, doth not put persons
into equality of Circumstances with those
<hi>whose Bloud is ennobled:</hi> and yet he
grants, <hi>that those who sate in the House of
Peers by virtue of their Summons did judge
as Peers;</hi> as is manifest from his own <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents
p.</hi> 15. from the 4 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. From
whence it follows, that this was not
thought to be the <hi>Reason</hi> by the <hi>Peers</hi>
themselves in Parlament.</p>
            <p>2. That this was not the <hi>Reason</hi> in the
Judgment of our greatest <hi>Lawyers;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they tell us, that where this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62146:70"/>
holds, yet it doth not make men
Judges. As for instance, <hi>those who are
ennobled by Bloud, if they</hi> be not <hi>Lords</hi>
of <hi>Parlament,</hi> are not to be Judges in
the case of one ennobled by Bloud. <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Lord of the Parlament of England,</hi>
saith <hi>Coke,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Instit. p. 48.</note> 
               <hi>shall be tried by his Peers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Lords of Parlament; and neither No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen
of any other Country, nor others that
are called Lords, and are no Lords of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament,
are accounted</hi> Pares <hi>Peers within
this Statute.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Parity</hi> is
not of <hi>Bloud,</hi> but of Privilege in Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>3. The Practice it self shews that this
was not the <hi>Reason.</hi> For this Reason
would equally hold whether the Trial be
at the <hi>King's Suit,</hi> or the <hi>Suit of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi>
but in the latter case, as in <hi>an appeal
for Murther,</hi> a man whose bloud is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobled
must be tried by those whose
bloud is not ennobled;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Coke</hi> 2 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stit. p. 49. <hi>Selden</hi>'s Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, 4to. pag. 347.</note> even <hi>by an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Iury of 12 men.</hi> And I desire our
<hi>Authour</hi> to consider what becomes of <hi>the
inheritable quality of Bloud</hi> in this case,
when Life and Fortune lies at the mercy
of 12 substantial Free-holders? who, it
is likely, do not set such a value upon
Nobility as Noble-men themselves do:
and yet our Law, which surely is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62146:70"/>
               <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> allows an <hi>Ordinary
Iury at the Suit of the party</hi> to sit in
Judgment upon the greatest Noble-men.
Therefore this <hi>Reason</hi> can signifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
against the <hi>Bishops,</hi> who are <hi>Lords</hi>
in <hi>Parlament,</hi> as I have already proved.</p>
            <p>[2.] <hi>I shall give a brief account of the
true and original</hi> Reason <hi>of this</hi> Trial by
Peers; <hi>without which, that</hi> Authour <hi>it
seems is resolved to conclude,</hi> that the
Iurisdiction of the Bishops in Capital Cases
is an abuse of Magna Charta, and a Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
offer'd to the Liberties of English Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
            <p>As to the general Reason of the <hi>Trial
by Peers,</hi> it is easie to conceive it to have
risen from the care that was taken, to
prevent any unfair proceedings in what
did concern the Lives and Fortunes of
men. From hence <hi>Tacitus</hi> observes of
the old <hi>Germans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Morib. Germ. c. 12.</note> that <hi>their Princes, who
were chosen in their great Councils to doe
justice in the several Provinces, had some
of the People joyned with them, both for
Advice and Authority.</hi> These were <hi>Asses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours</hi>
to the Judges; that mens lives and
fortunes might not depend on the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of one man: and they were chosen
out of the chief of the People, none but
those who were <hi>born free</hi> being capable
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62146:71"/>
of this honour. In the latter times of the
<hi>German State,</hi> before the subduing it by
<hi>Charlemagn,</hi>

their being conquer'd by him, there were
2 Courts of Judicature established among
them, as in other parts of the <hi>German
Empire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. One <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>Popular, viz.</hi> by
the <hi>Comites,</hi> or great Officers sent by the
Emperour into the several <hi>Districts;</hi> and
the <hi>Scabini,</hi> who were Assistants to the
other, and were generally chosen by the
People. The number of these at first was
uncertain; but in the <hi>Capitulars</hi> they are
required to be <hi>seven,</hi> who were always
to assist the <hi>Comes</hi> in passing Judgments.
But <hi>Ludovicus Pius,</hi> in his second <hi>Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
A. D.</hi> 819. c. 2. enlarged their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to 12. And if they did not come
along with him, they were to be chosen
out of the most substantial <hi>Free-holders</hi>
of the <hi>County:</hi> for the words are, <hi>De
melioribus illius Comitatûs suppleat nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum

true Original of our Juries. For our

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62146:71"/>
prove, if it were not impertinent to our
business; and thence discover a great
mistake of our Lawyers, who make our
ancient <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Customs</hi> peculiar to our
selves. As in this very case of <hi>Trial by
Peers,</hi> which was the common practice of
these parts of the World. Therefore <hi>Otto

many other examples might be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced:
but these are sufficient to make us
understand the <hi>true Original</hi> of this <hi>Right</hi>
of <hi>Peerage;</hi> which was from the <hi>Feodal
Laws;</hi> and all those who held of the
<hi>same Lord,</hi> and by the <hi>same Tenure,</hi> were
said to be <hi>Pares</hi> Peers. And therefore
since the <hi>Bishops</hi> in <hi>England</hi> were <hi>Barons</hi>
by <hi>Tenure</hi> ever since <hi>William</hi> I. by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
they were <hi>Peers</hi> to other <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons;</hi>
and had the same original <hi>Right</hi> of
<hi>Trial</hi> by other <hi>Barons</hi> as their <hi>Peers,</hi> hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
by the <hi>same Tenure,</hi> and sitting in
the <hi>same Court.</hi> And thus I hope I
have given (what that <hi>Authour</hi> so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62146:73"/>
desired, <hi>viz.)</hi> a <hi>rational account</hi>
of the <hi>Trial by Peers;</hi> and have thereby
shewed, that this is so far from being any
disadvantage to the <hi>Bishops</hi> Cause, that
it adds very much to the <hi>Iustice</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>And that this is so far from being <hi>a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Magna Charta,</hi> that it is within
the intention and meaning of it, I thus
prove. In the 14. ch. of <hi>Magna Charta</hi>
we read, <hi>Comites &amp; Barones non amercien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
nisi per Pares suos:</hi> but by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law the Amerciament of a <hi>Bishop</hi> is
the same with that of a <hi>Lay-Baron;</hi> and
therefore in the sense of the Law, they
are looked on as <hi>Peers.</hi> And all the
<hi>Parlamentary Barons,</hi> whether <hi>Bishops</hi> or
<hi>Abbots,</hi> were amerced as <hi>Barons.</hi> Thence

should not amerce the <hi>Abbot</hi> of <hi>Crowland
tanquam Baro,</hi> because he did not hold
<hi>per Baroniam aut partem Baroniae.</hi> And it
is confessed by the most learned Lawyers,
that the <hi>Lords Spiritual do enjoy</hi> the same
<hi>legal Privileges,</hi>

               <hi>as to a day of Grace; hunting in

               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:62146:73"/>
allows onely a <hi>double Parity, viz.</hi> as
<hi>to Lords of Parlament,</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Knights, Esquires, Gentlemen, or
Yeomen, without any consideration of
the great inequality of circumstances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them; <hi>(Yeomen</hi> having as little
sense of <hi>Gentility,</hi> as <hi>Commons</hi> can have
of the privileges of <hi>Nobles;)</hi> it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
that this <hi>Trial by Peers</hi> was not foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon <hi>equality of circumstances;</hi> and
that in all reason, those who do enjoy
the <hi>legal Privileges</hi> of <hi>Peers,</hi> are to be
looked on as such by <hi>Magna Charta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the great Objection is,</hi> that the
Lawyers are of another opinion, as to this
Trial by Peers; and not onely the common
sort, <hi>who take all upon Trust which
they find in the modern Law-Books, but</hi>
those who have searched most into Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
such as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> and Sir <hi>Edw.
Coke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this therefore I answer.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The</hi> Authour of the Peerage,<note place="margin">pag. 6.</note> &amp;c. <hi>proves</hi>
the Bishops are not Peers, because not to be
tried by Peers.<note place="margin">Privil. of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronage, <hi>pag.</hi> 143.</note> 
               <hi>This consequence Mr.</hi> Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<hi>utterly denies; for he saith,</hi> it is true
and plain that the Bishops have been Peers.
<hi>For which he quotes</hi> the Bishop of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester's
Case, who was question'd in the
King's Bench for leaving the Parlament at
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62146:74"/>
Salisbury in the beginning of Ed. <hi>III.</hi> and he
pleaded to the declaration, <hi>quod ipse est
unus e Paribus Regni,</hi> that he was one of
the Peers of the Realm: <hi>which, he saith,</hi>
was allowed in Court. <hi>And from other</hi>
Book-cases <hi>and</hi> Parlament-Rolls <hi>he there
evidently proves, that the</hi> Bishops <hi>were</hi>
Peers: <hi>which he not onely asserts in that
confused</hi> Rhapsodie, <hi>which went abroad
under his name; but in his elaborate
Work of the last Edition of his</hi> Titles of
Honour,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Titles of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> Sec. Part. ch. 5. § 32. in Marg.</note> 
               <hi>in which he corrected and left
out the false or doubtfull passages of his
first Edition. And among the rest, that
passage wherein this</hi> Authour <hi>triumphs,</hi>
A Bishop shall not be tried by Peers in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
Crimes. <hi>The same thing I confess is
said in the</hi> Privileges of the Baronage; <hi>which
he there calls</hi> a point of Common Law as
it is distinguished from Acts of Parlament;
<hi>i. e.</hi> the custom and practice hath been so.
<hi>And the onely evasion he hath for</hi> Magna
Charta <hi>is this;</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 153.</note> that it is now to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
according to the current practice, and
not by the literal interpretation of the
Words. <hi>Which is an admirable answer,
if one well considers it, and justifies all
violations of</hi> Magna Charta, <hi>if once they
obtain and grow into</hi> Custom. <hi>For then,
no matter for the express words of</hi> Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62146:74"/>
Charta, <hi>if the contrary practice hath
been received and allowed in legal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.
This is to doe by</hi> Magna
Charta, <hi>as the Papists doe by the</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
viz. <hi>make it a</hi> meer Nose of Wax,
<hi>and say</hi> it is to be interpreted according
to the Practice of the Church.</p>
            <p>2. Some things are affirmed about this
matter with as great assurance as this is,
which have not been the constant prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.<note place="margin">3. Instit. pag. 30.</note>
               <hi>Coke</hi> is positive, <hi>that Bishops are not
to be tried by their Peers;</hi> but so he is in
the same page, <hi>that a Nobleman cannot
wave his Trial by his Peers, and put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon the Trial of the Countrey:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it is said in the <hi>Record 4 Ed.</hi> III. that
<hi>Thomas Lord Berkely, ponit se super Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triam,
put himself upon his Countrey,</hi> and
was tried by a Jury of 12 Knights. And
28 <hi>H.</hi> VI. the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Suffolk</hi> declined
the Trial of his Peers, and submitted to
the King's mercy. By which it appears,
that this was a <hi>Privilege</hi> which was not to
be denied them, if they challenged it;
but, at least before 15 <hi>Ed.</hi> III. they might
wave it if they pleased; and after that
too, if they were tried out of <hi>Parlament.</hi>
For this <hi>Trial by Peers</hi> was intended for a
security against arbitrary Power in taking
away mens Lives; and therefore it was
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62146:75"/>
allowed <hi>at the King's Suit,</hi> but not <hi>at
the Suit of the Party.</hi> But if Bishops were
tried out of Parlament, and did volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
decline the challenge of this <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,</hi>
this is no argument at all against
their <hi>Right of Peerage:</hi> and so I find some
say it was in the Case <hi>of</hi> Fisher,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Godwin.</hi> vit. Rich. Scroop Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiep. Eborac.</note> 
               <hi>Bishop of
Rochester,</hi> in <hi>H.</hi> VIII'<hi rend="sup">s</hi> time; which is
the great <hi>Precedent</hi> in the Law-Books.</p>
            <p>3. The method of Proceeding as to the
<hi>Trial of Bishops</hi> by <hi>Common Iuries,</hi> while
the <hi>Pope's Power</hi> continued in <hi>England,</hi> is
not so clear, that any forcible Argument
can be drawn from thence. Because the
<hi>Bishops</hi> then looked on themselves as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>no Peers,</hi> out of Parlament, in point
of Judgment, but <hi>Bishops.</hi> As in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Case of <hi>Adam</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hereford,</hi>
under <hi>Edw.</hi> II. who was rescued from
the King's Bench by his <hi>Brethren</hi> the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi>
because they looked on his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
there as a <hi>Violation</hi> of the <hi>Liberties</hi>
of the <hi>Church.</hi> I do not go about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
these Proceedings; but I am sure
the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Peerage, &amp;c.</hi> very
much misrepresents this business: for he
makes it as if the Bishop were <hi>legally
convicted in Court by a common Iury,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 7.</note> and
that <hi>after conviction he was deliver'd to the
Archbishop, to the intent,</hi> as he supposes,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62146:75"/>
               <hi>that he should be degraded.</hi> Whereas, in
truth, the <hi>Bishops</hi> carried him out of the
Court, without his giving any Answer
to the Endictment; and when he was
absent, the <hi>King</hi> commanded the <hi>Iury</hi> to
bring in their Verdict; and without ever
being heard to make any Defence for
himself,<note place="margin">Walsingh. <hi>pag.</hi> 119.</note> they found him <hi>guilty</hi> in all the
Articles laid to his Charge. That <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour</hi>
very freely bestows the terms of
<hi>Impudence</hi> on the Bishops of that time,
and <hi>Ignorance</hi> on those who go about to
defend them:<note place="margin">pag. 7. 14.</note> but I desire to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of these two makes a man thus mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>represent
a matter of fact? For it was
so far from being true, <hi>that upon Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he was deliver'd to the Archbishop to be
degraded;</hi> that he never appeared in
Court after, but continued under the
Archbishop's care, till, after a while, he
fully reconciled him to the King; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the Jury found him guilty
of Treason. I desire to be informed,
whether we are to understand <hi>Magna
Charta</hi> by such a Trial as this? Whether
he were <hi>judged by his Peers,</hi> I know not;
but I am sure he was not <hi>by the Law of the
Land;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Antiq. Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuar.</hi> in Walt. Raynolds pag. 215. ed. Han.</note> which I think is as good a part
of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> as the other. And <hi>this,</hi>
our Historians tell us, <hi>is the First Instance
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62146:76"/>
of any Trial of this kind, of any Bishop in
England:</hi> which hath too much of force
and violence in it, to be a good Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Magna Charta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Precedent</hi> is <hi>verbatim</hi> out
of Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> concerning <hi>Iohn de Isle,</hi>
and <hi>the Bishop of Ely his Brother;</hi> which
concerns such matters, wherein himself
confesses the <hi>Privilegium Clericale</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed;
and the Record saith, <hi>the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
entering his plea, that he was to be
deliver'd to him as a member of his Church,
he was accordingly deliver'd,</hi> after the Jury
had given in their Verdict. Which shews,
indeed, the good will that was then used,
to take away even the <hi>allowed Privileges</hi>
of the <hi>Clergy</hi> by common Juries. And
this is another stout Interpreter of <hi>Magna
Charta;</hi> when <hi>Bracton, Briton, Fleta,
Stat. West. 1. Articuli Cleri c.</hi> 15. are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,<note place="margin">2. Instit. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

even by Sir <hi>Edw. Coke,</hi> to be so
clear in the <hi>Clergie</hi>'s behalf in these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third Precedent,</hi> which is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
out of the same Authour, is of
<hi>Thomas Merks, Bishop of Carlisle;</hi> who,
for his fidelity to <hi>R.</hi> II. and the true
Heirs of the Crown, against the Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>H.</hi> IV. was found guilty of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
by a <hi>common Iury.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:62146:76"/>
is so ingenuous as to take notice, that
the Writ directed to the Justices had in it
a <hi>Non obstante</hi> to a Statute lately made
at <hi>Westminster; Licèt in Stat. apud Westm.
nuper edito inter caetera continetur, quòd
nullus Archiep. nec Episcopus coram Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciariis
nostris occasione alicujus criminis
impetatur, absque speciali praecepto nostro,
quousque,</hi> &amp;c. Which was read in Court:
but the Judges urging, <hi>that the Liberties
of the Church did not extend to high Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
then it is said, he did <hi>ponere se super
Patriam;</hi> just as <hi>Thomas Lord Berkely</hi>
did 4 <hi>Ed.</hi> III. This is the onely <hi>Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
that proves that a Bishop, before
the time of <hi>H.</hi> VIII. did <hi>put himself upon
a common Iury:</hi> and yet we find as good
a <hi>Precedent</hi> of this sort, concerning an
allowed Peer of the Realm. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this single <hi>Precedent</hi> be sufficient to
interpret <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> against the plain
sense of the words, and to make a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
practice,</hi> I leave any rational man to
judge.</p>
            <p>But if this were yielded in Cases
of high Treason, wherein the Privilege
of Clergy holds not; (especially since
the <hi>Statutes 25 Ed.</hi> III. <hi>c.</hi> 4. and 4 <hi>H.</hi> IV.
<hi>c. 2, 3.)</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> tells them, that
there is no consequence from hence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:62146:77"/>
               <hi>they are not to be tried by Peers,
therefore they are not Peers:</hi> since the
Common Law may limit this <hi>Privilege</hi> of
<hi>Peers</hi> in one particular case, which may
hold in all others. As it is no diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the <hi>Peerage</hi> of the <hi>Temporal Lords,</hi>
to be tried by a <hi>common Iury at the Suit
of the Party.</hi> I conclude the Answer to
this Argument,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Camden.</hi> Brit. pag. 123.</note> as Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> doth his
Discourse about this subject; who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
proved that the Bishops do enjoy
all other Privileges of Peers, except this of
being tried by them, (which he seems to
attribute to a kind of Revenge upon them,
for pleading such exemptions by the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-Law)</hi>
after all, he <hi>leaves it to the
Lawyers to determine, whether this be
juris explorati.</hi> The meaning of which I
am sure is not, as the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
expresseth it, <hi>that it was always so,
and never otherwise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the great difficulty to some is, <hi>that
a Praedial or Feudal Barony doth not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble
the Bloud; and therefore can give
no Right of Peerage.</hi> Whereas it is well
known, that all the Baronies of <hi>England</hi>
were such from the <hi>Conquerour</hi>'s time, till
after the <hi>Barons Wars,</hi> when, for Reason
of State, it was thought necessary to
make the Nobility more dependant on
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62146:77"/>
the Crown. And all that were <hi>Barons</hi>
were <hi>Pares, i. e. Peers.</hi> So <hi>du Fresn</hi>
quotes an old Poem of the <hi>Common Laws
of England,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Barons nous appellons les Piers
del Realm.<note place="margin">Glossar. v. Pares.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>France,</hi> from whence our Baronies
first came, <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Persons with <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial
Baronies</hi> are thought as capable of
<hi>Peerage</hi> as any. For, there at first all the
<hi>Barones Regni</hi> (who both in <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>England</hi> were the same with the <hi>Barones
Regis,</hi> however some of late have distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
them) sate in the great Council,
and all publick Affairs passed through
them; and they were judged by their
own Order: and these were called <hi>Pares
Regni,</hi> among whom the <hi>Bishops</hi> were
comprehended. At last <hi>Lewis</hi> VII. <hi>A. D.
1179.</hi> (as most Authours agree) chose
Twelve out of the great number of the
<hi>Peers</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> of which half the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
were <hi>Bishops</hi> who held <hi>feudal Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>
of the <hi>King;</hi> and the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of
<hi>Rheims</hi> is the First of the whole Number.
And because these enjoy'd greater Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
then other <hi>Peers,</hi> their number was
increased by particular <hi>Favour;</hi> but the
ancient <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Peerage</hi> remained to all
the <hi>Barons</hi> of the <hi>Realm.</hi> In <hi>Scotland,</hi>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:62146:78"/>
when they appointed <hi>Twelve Peers</hi> for
the <hi>King's Council,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Walsingh. <hi>ad A. D.</hi> 1296. Mat. Westm. <hi>A.</hi> 1295.</note> they were 4 <hi>Bishops,
4 Earls, 4 Barons.</hi> So that in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Nations <hi>Feodal Baronies</hi> were never
thought inconsistent with <hi>Peerage:</hi> and
we have as little Reason to think them so
with us; since to this day, the <hi>Bishops</hi>
do enjoy not onely the great Right of
<hi>Peerage,</hi> of sitting and voting in the
<hi>House</hi> of <hi>Peers,</hi> but have some personal
Privileges of <hi>Peers</hi> allowed them by the
<hi>Common Law,</hi> as is already shewed.</p>
            <p>II. The <hi>last</hi> thing to be considered is,
the <hi>Capacity</hi> in which they sit in the
<hi>House,</hi> whether as a <hi>Third Estate</hi> or not?
The <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi> not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
it, but opposes it with great vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency,
and offers many <hi>Authorities</hi>
and <hi>Reasons</hi> against it. All which must
be weighed with the same calmness and
impartiality, which hath been hitherto
used in this Discourse. And there are
Three things to be distinctly handled for
the clearing of this Matter: 1. His <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation;</hi>
2. His <hi>Authorities;</hi> 3. His <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(1.) His <hi>Foundation</hi> whereupon he
builds;<note place="margin">pag. 93.</note> which is, <hi>that the Bishops sit in
the House onely in the capacity of Temporal
Barons; William the Conquerour having
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62146:78"/>
brought the Temporalties of Bishops under
the condition of Baronies.</hi> That they do
sit there in the <hi>Right</hi> of their <hi>Baronies,</hi>
was yielded at first; but whether they sit
there onely in that capacity, is the thing
in Question.</p>
            <p>And here I crave leave to make use of
this <hi>Authour</hi>'s distinction, and to apply
it to this purpose; <hi>viz. of the Bishops sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in the House in a Iudicial way, and
in the Legislative way.</hi> When they sit <hi>in
the Iudicial way,</hi> as <hi>Members of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Court of Iudicature,</hi> I grant that
they sit onely in the <hi>capacity</hi> of <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Barons;</hi> as appears by the <hi>Constitution</hi>
of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> where the King requires
their attendance in <hi>Iudicature</hi> as his <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons:</hi>
But that in the <hi>Legislative way</hi> they
have a farther Capacity, as representing
a <hi>Third Estate</hi> in <hi>Parlament,</hi> I prove by
these Arguments.</p>
            <p>[1.] During the Vacancy of <hi>Bishopricks,
Writs</hi> were sent to the <hi>Guardians</hi> of the
<hi>Spiritualties,</hi> to attend the <hi>Parlament.</hi>
Which Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Titles of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, p. 2. ch. 5. n. 17. 23.</note> who cannot be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
for partiality in this matter, saith,
<hi>is obvious in the Rolls of Parlament;</hi> and
which he cannot deny to be an evidence
<hi>of the Bishops sitting in Parlament as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
and as Spiritual onely, as they did in
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62146:79"/>
the Saxon times,</hi> in the <hi>Wittena gemot.</hi>
So likewise, <hi>the Vicars-general</hi> had <hi>Writs</hi>
when the <hi>Bishops</hi> were beyond Sea. But
neither of these could sit in Parlament as
<hi>Temporal Barons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But because so much depends on the
proof of this, and no man hath yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
it, I shall bring clear Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the constant practice of it, from
the <hi>Records</hi> of the Tower.</p>

prove this to have been the constant prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of <hi>Parlaments</hi> in those times.</p>
            <p>[2.] Some <hi>Church-men</hi> were summon'd to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62146:80"/>
               <hi>Parlament</hi> who could have no pretence
to sit there as <hi>Temporal Barons.</hi> For
49 <hi>H.</hi> III. the <hi>Deans</hi> of <hi>York, Exceter,
Wells, Salisbury</hi> and <hi>Lincoln</hi> were sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd
with the like Writ as the rest.
And Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> observes,<note place="margin">Ib. n. 22.</note> that in the times
of <hi>Edw.</hi> I. <hi>Edw.</hi> II. <hi>Edw.</hi> III. where the
Clause <hi>Praemunientes</hi> is omitted in the
Writ to the Bishops, there particular and

and <hi>Priors</hi> of <hi>Cathedral Churches,</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in <hi>Parlament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to prove more fully the interest
the <hi>Clergy</hi> had then in <hi>Parlaments,</hi> it is
worth our observing, that in the ancient
<hi>Records</hi> there are 4 several sorts of <hi>Writs</hi>
wherein the <hi>Clergy</hi> were concerned.</p>
            <p>1. In the common <hi>Writs</hi> of <hi>Summons</hi>
to <hi>Parlament</hi> sent to the <hi>Archbishops</hi> and
<hi>Bishops,</hi> with the <hi>Clause</hi> of <hi>Praemunientes,</hi>
which runs thus; <hi>Premunientes Prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem

               <note place="margin">Titles of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, p. 595.</note> So Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> represents it
from the 50 <hi>Ed.</hi> III. <hi>membr.</hi> 6. And with
him Sir <hi>Edw.</hi>
               <note place="margin">4 Instit. p. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Coke</hi> agrees; who saith, <hi>by
this Clause in the Writ of Summons to the
Bishops, they are required to summon these
persons to appear personally at the Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament:</hi>
but he proves <hi>they had no Voices
there, because they are required onely</hi> ad
consentiendum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which is a very weak
argument. For, (1.) His own great <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
Modus tenendi Parlamentum,</hi>
saith expresly, <hi>they were called</hi> ad trac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tand.
&amp; deliberand. <hi>and that their names
were called over in the beginning of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament;
and that they had a Voice there,
and did make up part of the Commons of
England.</hi> Not that the <hi>Procuratores Cleri</hi>
did sit together with them, after they had
a Speaker of their own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of which I find
no Precedent: but they sate by themselves,
having a <hi>Prolocutor</hi> of their own: which
is the very same name used in the <hi>Rolls</hi>
for the <hi>Speaker</hi> of the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons.</hi>
(2.) These words do not exclude them
from being part of the <hi>commune Conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium
Regni,</hi> but onely shew, that their
Consent was required, according to the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:62146:81"/>
Custom of that time. And 23 <hi>Ed.</hi> I.
the <hi>Clause</hi> is more full, <hi>ad tract and. ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand.
&amp; faciend.</hi> the like 24 <hi>Ed.</hi> I. But
in 27 <hi>Ed.</hi> I. the words are, <hi>ad faciend. &amp;
consentiend.</hi> (3.) The same argument
would exclude the <hi>Commons</hi> from any
<hi>Voices:</hi> for in 23 <hi>Ed.</hi> I. the <hi>Writ</hi> for
chusing Knights and Burgesses ran after
the same manner; <hi>ita quod dicti milites
plenam &amp; sufficientem potestatem pro se

Burgenses pro se &amp; Communit Civit' &amp;

in premissis.</hi> Would any man be so
unreasonable to infer from hence, that
the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> have no Votes?
The same form is used 26 <hi>Ed.</hi> I.—30 of
the same. In 5 <hi>Ed.</hi> II. it is, <hi>ad consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiendum,</hi>

hath been the general form, ever since
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62146:81"/>
observed, and would exclude the <hi>House</hi>
of <hi>Commons</hi> from any <hi>Votes</hi> in <hi>Parlament,</hi>
as well as the <hi>Clergy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. There were other <hi>Writs</hi> of <hi>Summons</hi>
to <hi>Parlament</hi> wherein the <hi>Clause Praemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nientes</hi>
was left out; and then particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Writs were sent to such <hi>Deans</hi> and
<hi>dignified Clergy-men</hi> as the <hi>King</hi> thought
fit. So it was not onely 49 <hi>H.</hi> III. but
there were two Summons 23 <hi>Ed.</hi> I. and
in one of them the Clause <hi>Praemunientes</hi>
was inserted, in the other not. It was
left out 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> I. and in one 27 <hi>Ed.</hi> I.
and put in another, and left out again
28. and 30. of <hi>Ed.</hi> I. Inserted 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> II.
in one <hi>Writ,</hi> and omitted in others; and
so in the 3 following years: but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
generally inserted, except 6 <hi>Ed.</hi> II.
13. 16. 18. In 5 <hi>Ed.</hi> III. it was omitted,
and so in 6. and some few years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards:
but then it generally obtained,
that the Clause <hi>Praemunientes</hi> was put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Writs</hi> of the Bishops Summons to
the Parlament.</p>
            <p>3. There were <hi>Writs</hi> of <hi>Summons</hi> to
<hi>great Councils,</hi> which were no <hi>Assemblies</hi>
of the <hi>Estates;</hi> and then onely some great
<hi>Bishops</hi> and Lords, or other Great men were
summon'd, without any Writs to others,
or any notice taken of them. In such a
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:62146:82"/>
Summons 2 <hi>Ed.</hi> II. onely 4 <hi>Bishops</hi> are
named; 18 <hi>Ed.</hi> II. onely 6; 19 onely 5;
2 <hi>Ed.</hi> III. onely 2. and the <hi>Guardian</hi> of the
<hi>Spiritualties</hi> of the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> and
so 4 <hi>Ed.</hi> III. and in another the same
year, 3 besides the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.
5 Ed.</hi> III. Summons were sent to
the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> and 19 <hi>Bishops</hi>
more. 11 <hi>Ed.</hi> III. the Writ was directed
to the <hi>Archbishop of York, and such Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
Earls, and Great men as were of the
King's Council:</hi> and two more were sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd
the same year. The form of the
Writ differs little from that to the Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
onely the Clause <hi>Praemunientes</hi> is
always left out, and onely some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Bishops and Nobles are called, and no
Writs for elections of Knights or Burges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
In the 16 <hi>Ed.</hi> III. the Writ is sent
to the <hi>Archbishop</hi> and 7 <hi>Bishops</hi> more; but
none to <hi>Abbots, Priors, Sheriffs, &amp;c.</hi>
Which shews that this was <hi>Magnum Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilium,</hi>
as it is sometimes called, but no
<hi>Parlament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. There were <hi>Writs</hi> to summon a
<hi>Convocation</hi> distinct from the <hi>Writ</hi> of
<hi>Summons</hi> to the <hi>Parlament</hi> with the
Clause <hi>Praemunientes.</hi> This will appear
by the first <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Summons</hi> to a <hi>Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
which I have seen; which bears
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:62146:82"/>
date at <hi>Lincoln 17. Feb. 9 Ed. II.</hi> but the
<hi>Parlament</hi> was summon'd 16. of <hi>October</hi>
before, to meet at <hi>Lincoln in quindenâ
S. Hilarii;</hi> with the Clause <hi>Praemunientes</hi>
in the Writ to the <hi>Bishops.</hi> In which
Summons to <hi>Convocation</hi> it is expressed,
that <hi>those Bishops and others of the Clergy,
who were summon'd to Parlament, did, as
far as they were concerned, unanimously
yield to a Subsidy; but so, that others of the
Clergy who were not summon'd to Parlament
should meet in Convocation, and consent
thereto. Therefore the King sends his
Writ to the Archbishop to summon all the
Prelats, whether Religious or others, and
others of the Clergy of his Province, to meet
at</hi> London <hi>post 15. Pasch. ad tractand. &amp;
consentiend.</hi> &amp;c. Here we have the plain
difference between the <hi>Writs</hi> to <hi>Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and to <hi>Convocation.</hi> The <hi>Writs</hi> to
the <hi>Parlament</hi> were sent to the <hi>Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
and all the <hi>Bishops,</hi> with the clause
<hi>Praemunientes,</hi> &amp;c. summoning those of
the Clergy who were then thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to the <hi>Assembly of the Three Estates
in Parlament:</hi> but when a <hi>Convocation</hi>
was called, then the <hi>Writs</hi> were onely
directed to the <hi>Two Archbishops,</hi> who
were to summon the rest of the Clergy, and
not onely those who held by <hi>Baronies,</hi>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:62146:83"/>
but others of the dignified Clergy, <hi>tam
exemptos quàm non exemptos,</hi> with the
<hi>Proctors of the Chapters and Clergy of the
Diocese, ad tractand' &amp; consulend' super
premissis una vobiscum &amp; aliis per Nos
tunc mittendis.</hi> So it is expressed in the
<hi>Writ</hi> for <hi>Convocation 11 Ed.</hi> III. 29 <hi>Ed.</hi> III.
31 <hi>Ed.</hi> III. 7 <hi>R.</hi> II. 28 <hi>H.</hi> VI. 23 <hi>Ed.</hi> IV.
onely these two last have this difference,
<hi>ad tractand', consentiend', conclud' super
premissis, &amp; aliis que sibi clarius expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentur
tunc ibidem ex parte nostra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These things I have laid together, not
barely to clear this intricate matter, (as
it hath been made) of the interest the
<hi>Clergy</hi> then had in <hi>Parlaments</hi> as well as
<hi>Convocations;</hi> but chiefly to prove from
hence, that all the interest they had in
<hi>Parlaments</hi> was not meerly on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the <hi>Temporal Baronies</hi> which the
<hi>Bishops</hi> and many of the <hi>Abbots</hi> then had.
Which is the great, but common mistake
of the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[3.] After the <hi>Bishopricks</hi> were made
<hi>Baronies,</hi> the distinction even in <hi>Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
is kept up between the several <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states</hi>
of the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Laiety.</hi> For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<hi>Baronagium</hi> doth often take in
all; yet sometimes they are so remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
distinguished, that we may see they
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:62146:83"/>
were looked on as two distinct Estates in
<hi>Parlament.</hi> So <hi>Eadmerus,</hi> (speaking of
what passed in the <hi>Parlament 3 H. I)</hi>
saith, it was done <hi>utriusque Ordinis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordi
curâ &amp; solicitudine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eadmer.</hi> l. pag. 67.</note> 
               <hi>by the consent of
both Estates.</hi> So <hi>Matt. Paris,</hi> speaking
of the Summons to appear in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of <hi>H.</hi> I. comprehends all under those
2 Estates,<note place="margin">Matt. Paris <hi>pag.</hi> 55.</note> 
               <hi>Clerus Angliae, &amp; Pop. univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus:</hi>
and again, <hi>Respondente Clero, &amp;
Magnatibus cunctis.</hi> Speaking of a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament</hi>
under <hi>H.</hi> II. he saith,<note place="margin">pag. 143.</note> 
               <hi>Convocato
Clero Regni, ac Populo.</hi> In 39 <hi>H.</hi> III. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
a <hi>Parlament,</hi> he calls those as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
<hi>Nobiles Angliae, tam viri Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astici
quàm Seculares.</hi> And in the Writs
of <hi>Summons</hi> the distinction hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
preserved between the <hi>Praelati</hi> and
the <hi>Magnates:</hi> for in those to the <hi>Bishops</hi>
it is, <hi>cum caeteris Praelatis, Magnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi>
&amp;c. in those to the <hi>Temporal Lords,
cum Praelatis, Magnatibus,</hi> &amp;c. In those
to the <hi>Bishops</hi> they were commanded, <hi>in
Fide &amp; Dilectione quibus nobis tenemini:</hi>
in those to the <hi>Temporal Lords, in Fide
&amp; Homagio;</hi> or, since <hi>Ed.</hi> III. <hi>in Fide
&amp; Ligeancia.</hi> Which shews that they
were not summon'd meerly as <hi>Temporal
Barons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[4.] The <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi> confesseth
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:62146:84"/>
               <hi>the Clergy to be one of the three Estates of
the Kingdom;</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 86.</note> but denies them to be <hi>one
of the three Estates in Parlament.</hi> From
whence I argue thus. Either the Clergy
must be represented in Parlament, or
one of the <hi>Estates of the Kingdom</hi> is not
at all represented there. And if one of
the <hi>Estates of the Kingdom</hi> be not there
represented, how can it be a <hi>perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative?</hi>
So that this distinction of
the <hi>Three Estates of the Kingdom,</hi> and
the <hi>Three Estates in Parlament,</hi> una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably
overthrows the <hi>Parlament</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a compleat <hi>Representative.</hi> But in
23 <hi>H.</hi> VIII. <hi>n.</hi> 33. as Mr. <hi>Petyt</hi> observes,
there is this passage in the <hi>Parlament-Rolls.
It is considered and declared by the
whole Body of this Realm,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The ancient Right of the Commons, <hi>pag.</hi> 61.</note> 
               <hi>now repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by all the Estates of the same as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
in this present Parlament.</hi>
Therefore <hi>all the Estates of the Kingdom</hi>
must be represented in <hi>Parlament.</hi> And
1 <hi>Eliz. c. 3. The Lords Spiritual and
Temporal and the Commons</hi> are said to
<hi>represent in Parlament the Three E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
of the Realm.</hi> From whence it
follows, that, according to the sense of
the Parlament, if the Clergy be an Estate
of the Kingdom, as he saith they are,
they must be represented in Parlament,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:62146:84"/>
or the whole Body of the Realm cannot
be there represented.</p>
            <p>(2.) We now come to consider the
weight of <hi>Authority</hi> in this matter. For
which I shall premise two things.</p>
            <p>1. That the whole <hi>Parlament</hi> assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
are the best Judges, which are the
<hi>Three Estates in Parlament;</hi> and their <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
is more to be valued, then that of
any particular Persons, whether <hi>Lawyers,</hi>
or others.</p>
            <p>2. That no <hi>Parlaments</hi> can give bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Testimony in this matter, then those
which have assumed most to themselves.
For if there be <hi>Three Estates in Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and the <hi>Bishops</hi> be none, then the
<hi>King</hi> must be <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>Three;</hi> as the
<hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi> insinuates, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this discourse: and the natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
from hence seems to be a <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination;</hi>
or that two joyning together
may over-rule the third. Therefore in all
Reason, if any <hi>Parlaments</hi> would have
made the <hi>King</hi> one of the <hi>Three Estates,</hi>
it would have been either the <hi>Parlament
1 H.</hi> IV. which deposed one <hi>King,</hi> and set
up another; or that 1 <hi>R.</hi> III. which disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited
the Children of <hi>Ed.</hi> IV. and set
up their Uncle.</p>
            <p>I shall therefore first from the <hi>Rolls</hi> of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:62146:85"/>
these two <hi>Parlaments</hi> shew, which are
the <hi>Three Estates in Parlament;</hi> and
from them, evidently prove that the
<hi>King</hi> is none, but the <hi>Bishops</hi> are the
<hi>Third Estate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I begin with the Parlament 1 <hi>H.</hi> IV.
By the <hi>Rolls</hi> it appears, (1.) That <hi>R.</hi> II.
appointed two Procurators to declare his
Resignation of the Crown, <hi>coram omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
Statibus Regni, <hi>before all the States
of the Kingdom.</hi>
               </hi> From whence it una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably
follows, 1. that the King was
none of them; 2. that the Estates of the
Kingdom and the Estates in Parlament
are the same thing. (2.) Among the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
against <hi>R.</hi> II. one is concerning the
Impeachment of <hi>Tho. Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury
<hi>coram Rege &amp; omnibus Statibus
Regni,</hi> before the King and all the Estates
of the Realm.</hi> The King then was none
of the Estates. (3.) The Commissioners for
the sentence of Deposition are said to
be appointed <hi>per Pares &amp; Proceres
Regni Anglie Spirituales &amp; Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rales,
&amp; ejusdem Regni Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates,

representantes; <hi>by the Peers and
Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the
Commons of the Kingdom, representing all
the States of the Kingdom.</hi>
               </hi> Where ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:62146:85"/>
1. The <hi>Bishops</hi> are called <hi>Peers,</hi> as

            <p>
               <hi>In the</hi> Rolls <hi>of</hi> Parlament 1 R. III. <hi>it is
recorded,</hi> that before his Coronation, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Articles were deliver'd unto him in the
name of the Three Estates of the Realm of
England, that is to say, of the Lords Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
and Temporal and of the Commons by
name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now forasmuch as neither the
said Three Estates, neither the said Persons
which in their name presented and deliver'd
(as it is afore said) the said Roll unto our
said Sovereign Lord the King, were as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
in form of Parlament, divers
Doubts have been moved, <hi>&amp;c. Now by
the said</hi> Three Estates assembled in this
present Parlament, and by Authority of the
same, be ratified, and enrolled, <hi>&amp;c. Upon
which Mr.</hi> Pryn <hi>himself makes this Margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Note,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Abridgment of Records, pa. 710. 714.</note> The Three Estates must concurr

            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:62146:86"/>
But lest I should seem to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
onely of these <hi>two Parlaments,</hi> I
shall now shew this to have been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
sense of the <hi>Parlaments;</hi> as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear

               <hi>Walsingham</hi> saith, that <hi>H.</hi> V.
called <hi>aParlament, which was sitting at
that time:</hi> for the <hi>King</hi> kept S. <hi>George's
Feast</hi> at <hi>Windsor</hi> that year, from thence
he went to the <hi>Parlament</hi> at <hi>London,</hi>
which ended within a <hi>Month;</hi> and the
Ratification of the Peace bears date
<hi>May</hi> 2. Judge then, whether these were
not the <hi>Three Estates in Parlament?</hi> But
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:62146:87"/>
to prove this more fully. It seems by
23 <hi>H.</hi> VI. <hi>n. 24. that a Statute was made
in the time of H. V. that no Peace should
be made with France without the consent
of the Three Estates of both Realms;</hi> which
was then repealed. But whom they
meant by the <hi>Thrée Estates</hi> here in the
time of <hi>H.</hi> VI. appears by 28 <hi>H.</hi> VI.
<hi>n.</hi> 9. when the <hi>Chancellour, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the King, gave thanks to the Three
Estates, and prorogued the Parlament:</hi>
where it is plain, the <hi>Three Estates in
Parlament</hi> were meant, and that the <hi>King</hi>
could be none of them. In 38 <hi>H.</hi> VI.
<hi>n. 38.. the Chancellour</hi> again, <hi>in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the King and of the Three Estates,
having given thanks to all the Estates, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
the Parlament.</hi> But that which puts
this matter out of doubt is, that in the
<hi>Parlament 1 H.</hi> VI. the <hi>Queen Dowager</hi>
in her Petition mentions the <hi>Ratification</hi>
made in <hi>Parlament 9 H.</hi> V. and saith, <hi>it
was not onely sworn by the King, but
by the Thrée Estates of the Kingdom of
England: Cest assavoir, les Prelatz,
Nobles, &amp; Grands, &amp; per les Comuns
de mesm le Roialm Dengleterre;that
is to say, by the Prelats, Nobles, and other
Grandees, and by the Commons of the
Realm of England:</hi> as appears more fully,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:62146:88"/>
saith that Petition, by the <hi>Records</hi> and
<hi>Acts</hi> of the said <hi>Parlament.</hi> And the King
there declares in four several Instruments,
that the said Articles of Peace were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
and ratified by <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament,</hi>
in these words; <hi>Qui quidem

Nothing can be plainer from hence, then
that the <hi>Three Estates of the Kingdom</hi>
were no other then <hi>the Three Estates in
Parlament.</hi> And the same appears by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Petition of the same <hi>Queen, 2 H.</hi> VI.
<hi>n.</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>For latter Times I shall instance onely
in the <hi>Parlament 1 Eliz. c.</hi> 3. wherein the
<hi>Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons
declare, that they do represent in Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the Thrée Estates of the Realm.</hi>
From whence it follows, 1. That the
<hi>Three Estates of the Kingdom</hi> must be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented</hi>
in <hi>Parlament.</hi> 2. That the
<hi>Lords Spiritual and Temporal and the
Commons</hi> do represent <hi>those Three Estates
of the Kingdom,</hi> and therefore are the
<hi>Three Estates</hi> in <hi>Parlament.</hi> 3. That the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:62146:88"/>
               <hi>King</hi> can be none of the <hi>Estates in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament,</hi>
because he doth not <hi>represent</hi> any
of <hi>the Estates</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is a wonder to me, that any
man, who considers the <hi>Constitution</hi> of
the <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> and how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
it was in all the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of
it, as to the <hi>Assemblies</hi> of the <hi>Three Estates,</hi>
could ever take the <hi>King</hi> to be one of
<hi>the Three Estates in Parlament.</hi> For the
Question would seem ridiculous to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of any other Nation, if we should
ask them whether the <hi>King</hi> was reckon'd
among the <hi>tres Ordines Regni?</hi> For by
the <hi>Three Estates</hi> they all mean the <hi>Three
Ranks</hi> of men, the <hi>Clergy, Nobility,</hi> and
<hi>Commonalty.</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 88.</note> But the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
could not deny that <hi>these were the
Three Estates of the Kingdom;</hi> but he
saith, <hi>the Three Estates of Parlament are
clean another thing:</hi> which I may reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
suppose, is sufficiently disproved
by the foregoing Discourse.</p>
            <p>But he quotes several <hi>Authorities</hi> for
what he saith, which must now be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
and will appear to be of no
weight, if compared with the evidence
already given on the other side.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The first</hi> Authority <hi>is of</hi> King Iames,<note place="margin">pag. 98.</note> in
his Speech at the Prorogation of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:62146:89"/>
1605. <hi>wherein he saith,</hi> the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament
consists of a Head, and a Body; the
King is the Head, the Body are the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Parlament. This Body is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided
into two parts, the Vpper, and the
Lower House. The Vpper consists of the
Nobility and the Bishops; the Lower of
Knights and Burgesses. <hi>The force of the
Argument lies in</hi> King Iames <hi>his making
the</hi> Bishops <hi>but a</hi> Part of the Vpper House:
<hi>but that this doth not exclude their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a</hi> Third Fstate, <hi>I prove by a Parallel
Instance. In</hi> 5 H. <hi>IV. the</hi> Bishop of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
<hi>being</hi> Chancellour, <hi>compared</hi> the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament
to a Body, <hi>as</hi> King Iames <hi>did; but
he made the</hi> Chùrch <hi>the</hi> Right Hand, <hi>the</hi>
Temporal Lords <hi>the</hi> Left Hand, <hi>and the</hi>
Commonaltie the other Members; <hi>yet
presently after, he calls these,</hi> the several
Estates which the King had called to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament.
<hi>But that the</hi> Bishops <hi>sitting in
the</hi> same House with the Temporal Lords
<hi>doth not hinder their being a</hi> distinct
Estate, <hi>will appear, when we come to
answer his</hi> Reasons. <hi>And for</hi> King Iames
<hi>his sense as to this matter, we may fully
understand it by this passage in his</hi> Advice
to his Son.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Basilic. Dor.</hi> l. 2. p. 159. of his Works.</note> As the whole Subjects of our

Policy of our Kingdom) are divided into

Three Estates, &amp;c. <hi>These words are spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of the</hi> Kingdom <hi>of</hi> Scotland; <hi>but the</hi>
ancient and fundamental Policy <hi>of that is
the same with</hi> England; <hi>and he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved</hi>
the Subjects made the Three Estates

be one of them here.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next <hi>Authority</hi> is of <hi>King Charles I.</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 100.</note>
               <hi>in his Answer to the 19 Propositions Iune 2.
1642. wherein he tells the two Houses, that
neither one Estate should transact what is
proper for two, nor two what is proper for
three.</hi> To which I answer, that the <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
of that <hi>Answer</hi> was so intent upon the
main business, <hi>viz. that the two Houses
could doe nothing without the King,</hi> that
he did not go about to dispute this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with them, <hi>whether the King were one
of the Three Estates or not;</hi> but taking
their supposition for granted, he shews
that they could have no <hi>Authority</hi> to act
without the <hi>King's concurrence.</hi> But the
unwary Concessions in that <hi>Answer</hi> were
found of dangerous consequence after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
when the <hi>King</hi>'s enemies framed
the <hi>Political Catechism</hi> out of them; which
is lately reprinted, no doubt, for the good
of the People.</p>
            <p>In 2 <hi>H.</hi> IV. <hi>n.</hi> 32.<note place="margin">pag. 101.</note> he makes <hi>the House
of Commons to declare to the King and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:62146:90"/>
Lords, that the Three Estates of the Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are the King, the Lords Spiritual,
and Temporal.</hi> Whereas the truth of that
matter is this: A difference had happen'd
in the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> between the <hi>Earl</hi>
of <hi>Rutland</hi> and <hi>Lord Fitz-Walter;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the <hi>House of Commons</hi> go up to the
<hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Lords,</hi> and having, it seems,
an <hi>Eloquent Speaker,</hi> who ventured upon
dangerous <hi>Metaphors,</hi> he makes bold with
the <hi>Similitude</hi> of the <hi>Trinity;</hi> because that
would help him to perswade them to <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:</hi>
but if he had left the <hi>King</hi> out, he
might have been suspected to have set up
an <hi>Independent Power</hi> in the <hi>Three Estates:</hi>
therefore lest he should lose his <hi>Similitude,</hi>
(which goes a great way with an elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
man) he strains another point,
and draws the <hi>King</hi> into his <hi>Trinity.</hi> And
is such an expression to be mention'd in
comparison with the express Declaration
but the year before, 1 <hi>H.</hi> IV. of both
<hi>Houses</hi> concerning the <hi>Three Estates in
Parlament?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next to this <hi>Similitude,</hi> that of <hi>Stephen
Gardiner</hi> ought to be mention'd; <hi>who
compared Faith, Hope, and Charity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
to Iustification, to the concurrence
of the Three Estates in Parlament,</hi> i.e. <hi>the
King and two Houses, to the making of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:62146:90"/>
Laws.</hi> But I wonder the <hi>Authour</hi> of the
<hi>Letter,</hi> who expresseth so much dislike
of his <hi>Divinity,</hi> would take his <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
in <hi>Politicks.</hi> But this notion of
making the <hi>King one of the Three Estates,</hi>
how valuable soever it be to some men, is,
it seems, onely to be met with in some grave
ancient <hi>Similitudes.</hi> But of what <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
these are, against the constant sense
of <hi>Parlaments</hi> so fully declared, I leave
any man of understanding to judge.</p>
            <p>For the judgment of <hi>eminent Lawyers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 103.</note>
he quotes but one in <hi>King Iames</hi> his
time, <hi>viz. Finch in his Book of Law, l. 2.
ch. 1. who doth indeed,</hi> in the words quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by him, <hi>make the King, Lords and
Commons to be the Three Estates.</hi> But I
can hardly imagine how a <hi>learned Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer</hi>
could fall into such a gross mistake,
unless the <hi>Modus tenendi Parlamentum</hi>
should give the occasion to it; which was
accounted <hi>no blind MS.</hi> in those days,
but a very great Treasure, as appears by
Sir <hi>E. Coke,</hi> who cites it on all occasions.
And very few Lawyers had the judgment
in <hi>Antiquity</hi> which Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> had, who
first discovered the just Age and Value of
that <hi>MS.</hi> This <hi>Authour</hi> indeed, towards
the conclusion of his <hi>Treatise,</hi> makes the
<hi>King the first of the Estates:</hi> but then he
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:62146:91"/>
makes <hi>Six Estates in Parlament,</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,</hi>
as he calls them; and delivers this
for good doctrine at the very end of his
Treatise, <hi>that if any one of all these be sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd,
and do not appear, yet,</hi> with him,
<hi>it is notwithstanding a full Parlament:</hi> nay,
he expresly saith, <hi>the King may hold a
Parlament without a House of Lords.</hi> But
there are so many other such Positions dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
by others in that <hi>Treatise,</hi> that I
need to say no more of it. And as to this
point of the <hi>King's being one of the Estates
in Parlament,</hi> Sir <hi>Ed. Coke,</hi> who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
too much admired that Treatise,
declares against it, in the very beginning
of his <hi>Treatise of the Parlament. This
Court,</hi> saith he, <hi>consisteth of the King's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
sitting there as in his Royal Politick
capacity; and of the Three Estates of the
Realm; viz. of the Lords Spiritual, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops
and Bishops, the Lords Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and the Commons of the Realm.</hi> And
however the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi> may
slight Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s Judgment in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;<note place="margin">pag. 86.</note>
yet these two may be sufficient to
weigh down the <hi>Scales</hi> against any <hi>one
Lawyer's Authority</hi> to the contrary; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
since they were never suspected, I
dare say, for any <hi>partiality</hi> towards the
<hi>Clergy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:62146:91"/>
(3.) But the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi>
thinks to carry this point by meer strength
of <hi>Reason.</hi> We must therefore diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consider the force of his Arguments.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>If Bishops were one of the Estates in
Parlament,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 89.</note> 
               <hi>Reason would they should vote
by themselves separately from other Lords,
which would make another Estate: But
they do not onely not vote apart by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
the whole Body of them together;
but that Body is divided and separated
within it self, one part from another.</hi> If
both Houses ever sate together, as some
imagine, (and as they do in a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Kingdom,) this way of Reasoning
will make but <hi>one Estate</hi> in <hi>Parlament</hi> all
that time. But to give a clear answer to
this objection; I distinguish two things
in the <hi>Bishops,</hi> their <hi>Spiritual Capacity,</hi> by
which they <hi>represent;</hi> and their <hi>Civil Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity</hi>
as <hi>Barons,</hi> in which they <hi>vote,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Rules</hi> of the <hi>House.</hi> For,
the manner of giving their <hi>Votes</hi> is a thing
under the <hi>Regulation</hi> of the <hi>House,</hi> and
depends upon <hi>Custom;</hi> but their <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Capacity</hi> as <hi>Bishops,</hi> in which they <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present,</hi>
doth not. And the Reason of
their sitting together with other Lords, is
upon the account of their <hi>Writs</hi> of <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;</hi>
which, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> confesseth,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:62146:92"/>
ever since the latter end of <hi>Edw.</hi> III. hath
been, for the <hi>Bishops cum ceteris Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,
Magnatibus &amp; Proceribus, collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quium
habere &amp; tractatum:</hi> and therefore
they are bound <hi>to sit together</hi> in the same
place with the <hi>Temporal Lords,</hi> or else
they cannot <hi>advise and confer together.</hi>
And I leave the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi> to
consider, whether his <hi>Reason,</hi> or the <hi>King's
Writ,</hi> ought to take place.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>If the Bishops were a Third Estate,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 89.</note>
               <hi>they must have a Negative voice to all that
passeth there: But the Bishops are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled
with the Temporal Lords in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
up the Majority, as a part of it.</hi> Since
I have evidently proved the <hi>Clergy</hi> to be
one of the <hi>Three Estates in Parlament,</hi>
if he be sure that every <hi>Estate</hi> ought to
have a <hi>Negative voice,</hi> then I am sure that
this Objection lies more upon him to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
then upon the <hi>Bishops.</hi> But to
prevent any new disputes, I shall return
this Answer to it. Since it is agreed on
both sides, that the <hi>Bishops</hi> do sit in the
<hi>House</hi> as <hi>Temporal Barons,</hi> and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
do make up the <hi>Majority of Votes</hi> in
the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Lords;</hi> it could not but
seem unreasonable, that they who voted
<hi>as Barons</hi> in the <hi>House</hi> should have a <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
voice</hi> in <hi>another capacity:</hi> and by
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62146:92"/>
this means they lost their distinct <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
voice,</hi> because by the <hi>King's Writs</hi>
they were to sit and vote with the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Lords.</hi> Just as it is in the <hi>Diets</hi> of
<hi>Germany:</hi> Since the distribution of that
<hi>Assembly of the Estates of the Empire</hi> into
the several <hi>Chambers,</hi> the <hi>Prelates</hi> vote
according to their <hi>Ranks:</hi> the <hi>Three Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>
in the <hi>Electoral College;</hi> the other <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi>
that are <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Empire,</hi> in
the <hi>Chamber</hi> of <hi>Princes;</hi> and those who
are not <hi>Princes,</hi> with the <hi>Counts</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons.</hi>
So that here the <hi>Votes</hi> of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
are mingled with the rest, without
a <hi>distinct Negative voice;</hi> and yet no one
questions but the <hi>Bishops</hi> do represent a
<hi>distinct Estate</hi> of the <hi>Empire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>This is a disparagement to the House
of Lords,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 90.</note> 
               <hi>that another Estate must be
joyned with them to make up their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative.</hi>
No more, then to the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
of the <hi>Empire,</hi> to have the <hi>Bishops</hi>
joyned with them, when the <hi>Imperial Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
vote by themselves. But what dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement
is this, for those to make up
the <hi>Majority of the Votes</hi> of the <hi>Baronage,</hi>
who sit there as <hi>Barons</hi> by <hi>Tenure,</hi> by a
<hi>Right</hi> as ancient as <hi>Will.</hi> the <hi>Conquerour,</hi>
by the <hi>Authour</hi>'s own confession?</p>
            <p>4. If the Bishops make a Third Estate,<note place="margin">pag. 91.</note>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:62146:93"/>
then a Parlament could not be held without
them: But a Parlament hath sate <hi>excluso
Clero,</hi> as that of Ed. <hi>I;</hi> and that it may do
so in point of Law, appears by the Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Iudges in Keilway's Reports,
because the Bishops sit in Parlament by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of their Baronies. <hi>This is the great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
to which I shall give a full Answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[1.] It is dangerous arguing from <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Cases</hi> to the excluding any
one of the <hi>Estates</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> from
being represented in Parlament: because
no one can tell where this way of arguing
will stop. If a <hi>Parlament</hi> may be good
without <hi>one Estate,</hi> why not without an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other?
And we have seen an <hi>House</hi> of
<hi>Lords</hi> excluded as unnecessary, upon such
kind of arguments; <hi>because they sit in
their own Persons, and represent none but
themselves.</hi> If we once depart from the
ancient and legal Constitution of <hi>Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
there will be no end of Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Every new Modeller of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath something to offer that looks
like Reason, at least to those whose inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
it is to carry it on. And if no <hi>Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi>
can be found, then they appeal to
a certain invisible thing called <hi>the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Contract of the Nation:</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a thing no where to be found, may
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:62146:93"/>
signify what any one pleaseth. Suppose
one extraordinary case happens through
the disorder of Times, <hi>that the Clergy have
been left out in a Parlament;</hi> what doth
this signify towards altering the <hi>legal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi>
and constant <hi>Course</hi> of <hi>Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
which from the beginning of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laments</hi>
in this Nation, have had the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state</hi>
of the <hi>Clergy</hi> represented in them?
as sufficiently appears by Mr. <hi>Petyt</hi>'s lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Preface to his late Discourse of <hi>the
ancient Right of the Commons.</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 7, &amp;c.</note> The first

A. D.</hi> 694.<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. <hi>p.</hi> 182. 189. 318. 327. 336. 340. 344. 428. 534.</note>

under <hi>Kenulphus</hi> of <hi>Mercia;</hi> at <hi>Calecyth,</hi>
at <hi>London,</hi> at <hi>Kingston.</hi> Nay, not one
can be found by me in the <hi>Saxon</hi> times,
wherein the <hi>Bishops</hi> are not expresly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd.
So that if there be such a thing
to be found as <hi>the Fundamental Contract
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:62146:94"/>
of the Nation</hi> about the <hi>Constitution</hi> of
<hi>Parlaments,</hi> I do not question but they
have their share in it. Insomuch that
Sir <hi>H. Spelman</hi> makes it his description of
the <hi>Wittena-Gemot,</hi> that in it, as Mr. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyt</hi>
observes, <hi>Convenêre Regni Principes,
tam Episcopi quàm Magistratus, liberique
homines;</hi> i.e. <hi>it was an Assembly of the
Three Estates.</hi> So that before there were
any such things as <hi>Baronies,</hi> they were
an <hi>essential part of the English Parlament.</hi>
And must all this clear and undoubted
evidence from the first mention of <hi>Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
be rejected, because once upon a
time, a certain <hi>King</hi> called a certain <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament,</hi>
wherein, upon some Distast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Clergy,</hi> the other
<hi>Estates</hi> continued sitting without them?</p>
            <p>[2.] This single Instance about the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament</hi>
under <hi>Ed.</hi> I. is much misunderstood,
as will appear by these considerations.</p>
            <p>1. That the <hi>Clergy excluded themselves,</hi>
and were not shut out by the <hi>Act</hi> of the
<hi>King</hi> and the <hi>other Estates.</hi> For upon
the <hi>Bull</hi> of Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> VIII. forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Clergy giving any more Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
(which was procured by <hi>Archbishop
Winchelsee,</hi> as our Historians relate) a
<hi>Parlament</hi> being called by <hi>Ed.</hi> I. at <hi>Saint
Edmondsbury</hi> on purpose for <hi>Subsidies, the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62146:94"/>
Clergy refuse, upon the Pope's prohibition,
till they had consulted the Court of Rome;
and go away every one to their own homes:</hi>
notwithstanding which, the King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
with the other <hi>two Estates,</hi> and
gets <hi>Subsidies from the Laiety.</hi> So that
the <hi>exclusion of the Clergy</hi> came from their
own <hi>voluntary Act;</hi> when the King desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
no such thing, nor the other <hi>two E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,</hi>
but were all extremely provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
at this withdrawing of the Clergy.
That this <hi>Parlament</hi> was called purposely
for the <hi>Subsidy,</hi> appears by the <hi>Writ</hi> still
upon <hi>Record;</hi> wherein the Archbishop
is summon'd to appear,<note place="margin">Claus. 24 Ed. 1. M. 7. dorso.</note> 
               <hi>ad ordinandum
de quantitate &amp; modo subsidii memorati.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Whereas it is insinuated, <hi>that great
matters were done, and good Laws passed,
when the Clergy were excluded;</hi> I find no
such thing. It is true, the confirmation
of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> by <hi>Ed.</hi> I. (which was a
great thing indeed) is said, in the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute-Books,</hi>
to be done <hi>the same year, viz.
25 Ed.</hi> I. But that it could not be done
in that <hi>Parlament,</hi> I thus prove. That
<hi>Parlament</hi> was called <hi>crast.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Walsingh. <hi>pag.</hi> 18. Thorn. <hi>ad A.</hi> 1296. Knighton, <hi>p.</hi> 2491. Matt. West. <hi>pag.</hi> 428.</note> Animarum;
the King appoints another at <hi>London crast.
Hilarii:</hi> where the difference still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing,
he appoints a new <hi>Parlament</hi> on
the day of <hi>S. Peter ad Vincula,</hi> or <hi>Lammas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:62146:95"/>
wherein <hi>he was reconciled to the
Archbishop and Clergy.</hi> Then <hi>Fealty</hi> is
sworn to his <hi>Son,</hi> before his going into
<hi>Flanders;</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> excused himself
as to the great <hi>Taxes</hi> and <hi>Subsidies,</hi> on the
account of his <hi>Wars.</hi> While he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Winchelsea,</hi> a <hi>Remonstrance</hi> is sent to
him of the <hi>Grievances of the Nation,</hi> in
the name of the <hi>Archbishops, Bishops, Earls,
Barons, and the whole Commons of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
wherein they complain of <hi>illegal
Taxes,</hi> and <hi>the breach of Magna Charta.</hi>
The <hi>King</hi> gives a dilatory answer, and
passes over into <hi>Flanders.</hi> In his absence
the People refuse to pay the <hi>Taxes,</hi> and
the <hi>Lords</hi> combine together, and all
things tend to an open <hi>Rebellion.</hi> His
<hi>Son Ed.</hi> II. calls a <hi>Parlament</hi> at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and promises a <hi>Confirmation</hi> of the
<hi>Charter, and that no Taxes should hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be raised, either on Clergy or Laiety,
without their consent.</hi> Which being sent
over, <hi>Edw.</hi> I. confirmed it with his <hi>own
Seal:</hi> which was all done within the
compass of this year. But he again rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
it in the <hi>Parlament 27 Ed.</hi> I. So
that nothing was done in that <hi>Parlament</hi>
at <hi>S. Edmondsbury,</hi> but <hi>granting a</hi> 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               <hi>of the Laiety to the King.</hi> And when the
great Laws were passed, the <hi>King and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:62146:95"/>
Clergy</hi> were <hi>reconciled, and they sate in
Parlament.</hi> And the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi>
fell into the King's displeasure af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
for being so active a promoter
of them. The summe then of this mighty
argument is, <hi>that the Lords and Commons
once granted their own Subsidies, without
the concurrence of the Clergy;</hi> therefore
the <hi>Clergy</hi> are no <hi>essential part</hi> of the <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The Reason assigned in <hi>Keilway</hi>'s
<hi>Reports,</hi> why the <hi>King</hi> may hold a <hi>Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
without the <hi>Bishops,</hi> is very insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient:<note place="margin">pag. 92.</note>
               <hi>viz. because they have no place in
Parlament by reason of their Spiritualty, but
by reason of their Temporal possessions.</hi> The
insufficiency of which Reason will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by two things.</p>
            <p>1. That it is not true: as appears by
this, that the Clergy are <hi>one of the Estates
of the Kingdom;</hi> and all the <hi>Estates</hi> of the
<hi>Kingdom</hi> must be represented in Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>2. Were it true, it is no good Reason.
For why may they be excluded <hi>because
they sit on the account of their Baronies?</hi>
Where lies the force of this Reason? Is
it because there will be Number enough
without them? That was the <hi>Rump</hi>'s
Argument against the <hi>Secluded Members.</hi>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:62146:96"/>
And I hope the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi> will
not justify their Cause. Or is it because
they hold their <hi>Baronies</hi> by <hi>Tenure?</hi> So
did all the ancient <hi>Barons</hi> of <hi>England:</hi>
and why may the King hold his <hi>Parlament</hi>
with the other <hi>Barons,</hi> without the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops;</hi>
and not as well with the <hi>Bishops,</hi>
without the other <hi>Barons?</hi> Which I do
not see how it can be answer'd upon
those grounds. Suppose the Question
had been thus put, Since all the ancient
<hi>Lords of Parlament</hi> were <hi>Barons</hi> by <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure,</hi>
and <hi>Parlaments</hi> were held for many
Ages without any <hi>Barons</hi> by <hi>Patent</hi> or by
<hi>Writ,</hi> why may not the <hi>King</hi> hold his
<hi>Parlament</hi> after the ancient way, onely
with <hi>Barons</hi> by <hi>Tenure?</hi> I do not see,
but as good a Reason may be given for
this, as that in <hi>Keilway</hi>'s <hi>Reports.</hi> All that
I plead for is, that our good ancient and
legal Constitution of <hi>Parlament</hi> may not
be changed for the sake of any single
<hi>Precedents,</hi> and rare <hi>Cases,</hi> and obscure
<hi>Reports</hi> built upon weak and insufficient
Reasons.<note place="margin">pag. 68.</note> For, as the <hi>Authour</hi> of the
<hi>Letter</hi> very well saith, <hi>Consuetudo Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamenti
est Lex Parlamenti, The constant
Practice of Parlaments</hi> (and not one sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Instance) <hi>is the Law of Parlaments.</hi>
And suppose that <hi>Precedent</hi> of 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> I.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:62146:96"/>
as full as could be wished in this case; yet
I return the answer of the <hi>Authour</hi> of the
<hi>Letter</hi> in a like case,<note place="margin">pag. 49.</note> 
               <hi>This is but one single
Precedent,</hi> (of a Parlament without Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,)
<hi>against multitudes wherein they
were present: it was once so, and never but
once. And can that be thought sufficient
to alter and change the constant course and
practice of Parlaments, which hath been
otherwise?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing now remains, but a severe
reflexion on the <hi>Popish Bishops for opposing
the Statute of Provisors,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 96.</note> 
               <hi>and the several
good Acts for the Reformation.</hi> But what
this makes against the <hi>Votes of Protestant
Bishops</hi> is hard to understand. If he
thinks those could not make <hi>a good Third
Estate in Parlament,</hi> who took Oaths to
the <hi>Pope</hi> contrary to their <hi>Allegeance,</hi> and
the interest of the Nation, so do we. If
he have a great zeal for the <hi>Reformation,</hi>
so have all true Members of the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>England,</hi> who, we doubt not, will hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
maintain the <hi>Cause</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Vsurpations</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> though
the heat of others should abate. For did
not our <hi>Protestant Bishops</hi> seal the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi>
with their <hi>Bloud,</hi> and defend it
by their admirable <hi>Writings?</hi> What
<hi>Champions</hi> hath the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:62146:97"/>
ever had to be compared in all respects
with our <hi>Cranmer, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>idley, Iewel, Bilson,
Morton, Hall, Davenant,</hi> and many other
<hi>Bishops</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England?</hi> And
notwithstanding the hard fortune <hi>Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
Laud</hi> had in other respects, not to be
well understood in the Age he lived in;
yet his enemies cannot deny his <hi>Book</hi> to be
written with as much strength and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
whatsoever. I shall conclude with
saying, that the <hi>Clergy</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>England</hi> have done incomparably more
Service against <hi>Popery,</hi> from the <hi>Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to this day, then all the other <hi>Parties</hi>
among us put together: And that the
<hi>Papists</hi> at this time wish for nothing more,
then to see men, under a pretence of <hi>Zeal</hi>
against <hi>Popery,</hi> to destroy our <hi>Church;</hi> and
while they cry up <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
the legal Rights thereof, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
break the first Chapter of it; and from
disputing the <hi>Bishops presence in Cases Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi>
to proceed to others; and so by degrees
to alter the <hi>ancient Constitution</hi> of our <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laments,</hi>
which will unavoidably bring <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi>
and <hi>Confusion</hi> upon us: from which,
as well as <hi>Popery, Good Lord, deliver us.</hi>
