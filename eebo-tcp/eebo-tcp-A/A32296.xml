            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

22. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 25.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57005:14"/>
of this politique body, cannot but make all the other members to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of theill diſpoſition of it. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this reaſon it is, that before ſuch time as the Stat. of <hi>R.</hi> 2. was thought of, it was holden that the Stat. <hi>De Religioſis,</hi> otherwiſe called the Statute of <hi>Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi> made in the ſeventh of the Reign of <hi>E.</hi> 1. which did make a general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint from diſpoſing of lands in <hi>Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi> did never extend unto the repeal of the cuſtome of <hi>London,</hi> which did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thoſe that were Citizens and Freemen of <hi>London</hi> to deviſe their lands in <hi>Mortmain,</hi> as before.</p>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57005:14"/>
and be bound as an Apprentice, after the cuſtome and order of the City of <hi>London</hi> for ſeven years at the leaſt. It ſeemeth that the intent of the makers of that Statute, was rather to confirm; than repeal the cuſtomes of <hi>London,</hi> for it would never make the cuſtome of <hi>London</hi> to be the example which ought to be perſued, if it had had an intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to repeal it. And by the ſame reaſon, that the cuſtome of <hi>London</hi> ſhall not be comprehended within the general words of one branch of the Statute, the general words of another branch ſhall not be extended unto them.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, it is to be obſerved, that the <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Rat.</hi> 3.</note> Statute of 5. <hi>Eliz.</hi> hath a <hi>proviſo,</hi> That this Act, nor any thing therein contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or mentioned ſhall not be prejudicial or hurtful unto the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Norwich</hi> or to the lawful Liberties, uſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, cuſtomes, or priviledges of the ſame Cities.

unto the Commitees for the expreſſing of all manner of Trades, and thought that the Trade of an <hi>Vpholster</hi> had been ſuch a Trade that required Art and Skill for the exerciſing of it, they would not have failed to make mention of it.

Thirdly, the Trade of an <hi>Vpholſter</hi> doth not require any Art or <note place="margin">3.</note> Skill for the exerciſing of it, inaſmuch as he hath all things made to his hand, and it is only to diſpoſe them in order after ſuch time as they are brought to him, as the Ticks of his Beds he borroweth from a Weaver, the Frames of his Beds and Stooles from the Joyners and Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, his Iron-Rods and Nailes from the Smith, his guilding, and ſetting forth and adorning of his Beds and Stools from the Guilder and Painter; and ſo he is like to <hi>Aeſops</hi> Bird, which borroweth
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57005:16"/>
of every Bird a feather, his art reſting meerly in the overſeeing and diſpoſition of ſuch things which other men work, and in the putting of feathers into a tick, and ſowing them up when he hath done, the which one that hath been an Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice unto it but ſeven days is able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. And the intent of this Statute was not to extend unto any other trades, but ſuch as required Art and Skill for the managing of them: and therefore it was adjudged in the Exchequer upon an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation againſt one in the 42, year of the Reign of the late Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> that a Coſter-monger was not a Trade intended by the Statute of 5. <hi>Eliz.</hi> becauſe his art was in the ſelling of Apples, the which required no skill or experience for the exerciſe of it. So an Husbandman, Tankard-bearer, Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, Porter, Miller, and ſuch like Trades, are not within the Statute of 5. <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 4. ſo as none may exerciſe them, but ſuch a one that hath been an Apprentice by the ſpace of ſeven years; for they are arts which require rather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>billity of body than skill: But a Brewer and Baker are within the Statute, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it concerneth the health of mens

                        <p n="1">1. Whether this Debt of the Inteſtate being only a Debt due upon a ſimple Contract, be ſuch a Debt of which a Forreign Attachment may be made according to the cuſtome of <hi>London?</hi>

the action faileth upon the promiſe for not paying the money.</p>
                        <p>As to the firſt Queſtion, which is, <note place="margin">

                        <p>It was agreed and reſolved, that a forreign Attachment might well be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it: For by the cuſtome of <hi>London,</hi> the Executor or Adminiſtrator being chargeable for a debt due by the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or Inteſtate upon a ſimple contract, as well as upon a ſpecialty, a Forreign Attachment may be ſued as well for that debt, as for a debt due upon Specialty.

according to that cuſtome in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmance of the judgment given in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> But it was agreed, that if there had <note place="margin">

                           </note> not been any debt due by the Inteſtate unto <hi>Haydon;</hi> Now howſoever there had been an Attachment made in <hi>London</hi> of the debt due by <hi>Spink</hi> unto the Inteſtate, and a judgement given upon it, yet might the Adminiſtrator have relieved himſelf by way of Denial, and Traverſe that there had been any debt due by the Inteſtate unto <hi>Haydon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As to the ſecond Queſtion, which is, <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2.</note> Whether the cuſtome of Forreign At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments in <hi>London</hi> may hold as this Caſe is?</p>
                        <p>It was agreed and reſolved, That it may and doth well enough hold. For howſoever that none was charge able at the Common Law by the name of an Adminiſtrator, inaſmuch as by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 31. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> No accuſation lay againſt an Adminiſtrator by that name; And that <hi>A custome may not commence ſince the making of that Statute;</hi> yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as he was chargable at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law as an Executor for his Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57005:20"/>
ſo that the name of the charge is only changed, and yet in ſubſtance is all one (For every Executor is an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator and the pleading is upon an action brought againſt an Executor, that he never was Executor, nor ever admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred as an Executor. And an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator hath the quality and office of an Executor.) Therefore the cuſtom of Forreign Attachments will hold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an Adminiſtrator, as well as againſt an Executor.</p>
                        <p>As to the third Queſtion which is, Whether the Forreign Attachment for <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> the debt due unto the Inteſtate after the promiſe broken be ſuch a diſpenſation with the promiſe, that no Action now lieth for the Adminiſtrator upon the breach of the promiſe?</p>
                        <p>It was agreed and reſolved, that the promiſe was diſpenſed with, and no action lay upon the breach of it; for the debt due by <hi>Tenant</hi> unto the Inteſtate; which was the ground, and cauſe of the promiſe made unto <hi>Spink:</hi> the Plaintiff is taken away by the judgement had in <hi>London</hi> upon the cuſtome of Forreign
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57005:21"/>
Attachments, <hi>Et ſublato fundamento fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit opus.</hi> And therefore if after the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe broken there had been a Recovery had of the principal debt by the Plaintiff as Adminiſtrator, or otherwiſe, there had been a Releaſe made unto the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant. Now the Action upon the Caſe upon the promiſe would have failed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the debt, which was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and ground of the promiſe is gone, and ſo the dampnification which he ſhould have had by not performance of the promiſe faileth.</p>
                        <p>And agreeing to this reſolution was the Caſe of one <hi>Bardeſton,</hi> and <hi>Humfry</hi>

Thirdly, this Charter bereaving the King of the payment of priſage which is a Flower of his Crown, ought to have a ſtrict conſtruction, ſo as none may take benefit of it, but only ſuch as are within the preciſe words of the Charter; wherefore <hi>George Hanger</hi> being dead, and ſo no more a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> howſoever the Wines in the Ship may be ſaid to be the Wines of <hi>George Hanger</hi> to a ſpecial intent, that is to ſay, for the payment of his Debts, and the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Legacies according to his true intendment expreſſed in his Will, yet may they not be ſaid to be the Goods of <hi>George Hanger</hi> to every intent, in ſo much that <hi>Frances Hanger</hi> the Executrix hath the diſpoſition of them according to her will, and pleaſure, and the Poet ſaith, <hi>Da tua dum tua ſunt, nam poſt mortem tua non ſunt;</hi> and they not being the Wines of a Citizen to every intent, but only to a ſpecial intent, may not be ſaid to be capable of the diſcharge of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of priſage according to the Caſe that hath been adjudged, that where the King by his Letters Patents doth grant <note place="margin">8. <hi>H.</hi> 42.</note> the Goods, and Chattels of all Felons and Fugitives unto a common perſon, now
<pb facs="tcp:57005:30"/>
the Patentee, by vertue of this grant, may not claim the Goods, and Chattels of one that is a Felon of himſelf, in ſo much that he is a Felon only to a ſpecial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; and this being a Flower of the Kings Crown, ſhall not paſs by general words,</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, Priſage being a thing <note place="margin">4.</note> which is not due until ſuch time as the bulk be broken; now forasmuch as <hi>George Hanger</hi> was dead, and ſo was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchiſed before ſuch time as the duty accrued, the Charter ſhall not extend to diſcharge the Wines in the hands of the Executrix of the payment of Priſage.</p>
                        <p>And ſo having given you a taſte of the <note place="margin">Sir <hi>H.

                        <p>Secondly, what is the cauſe, and ground why the King hath Priſage.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly at what time priſage ſhall be ſaid to be due.</p>

                        <p>Fifthly, whether the Charter of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge unto the Mayor and Commonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the payment of Priſage be good, when the grant is made to the Mayor and Commonalty, and the benefit di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed unto the natural perſons and the ground of the making of this Charter.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, what perſons ſhall be diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the payment of Priſage within the words of the Charter which ſaith, <hi>Quod de vinis Civium nulla priſa fiat.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Seventhly, what Wines ſhall be ſaid to be diſcharged of the payment of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage within the words of the Charter.</p>
                        <p>As to the firſt, Priſage is a certain duty which the King and his Predeceſſours by <note place="margin">1. What pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage is.</note> themſelves, or their Officers by a cuſtom (time out of mind of man) hath uſed to take for the proviſion of his houſhold of all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants of all Wines whatſoever, which the ſaid <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants bring from beyond the Seas into the Coaſts of <hi>England.</hi> In which ſaid deſcription it is firſt obſerved, that it is a duty due from the ſubject unto his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and not a voluntary gift of the ſubject unto the King. Hereupon it is that in
<pb facs="tcp:57005:31"/>
                           <hi>H.</hi> 4. 3. in the Patent-Roll in the Tower you ſhall find priſage termed by the name of <hi>Regia, &amp; Recta priſa;</hi> for that it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reineth and is due unto the King of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Right; and being a Flower of his Crown, may not belong unto any man elſe but by eſpecial Grant. Secondly, it appeareth that it is called a certain duty, becauſe it is manifeſtly certain, what the King ſhall have out of every Ship, both in reſpect of the time when he ſhall take it, in reſpect of the place where he ſhall have it, and in reſpect of the quantity which he ſhall have. For as to the time when he ſhall take it, it is upon the breaking of the Bulk of the Ship, and not before; for if a Ship come into the Port laden with Wines, and the Bulk of her is not broken, now may not <note place="margin">6. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 5.</note> Priſage be demanded of her. And as to the place where the King ſhall take this priſage, it is aſcertained by a Book-Caſe, where it is ſaid, That the King <note place="margin">20. <hi>Ric.</hi> 2. Rot. Pat.</note> ſhall take one Tun behind the Maſt, and the other before. And as to the certain quantity which the King is to take, it is manifeſt by divers ancient Records; for if a Ship have ten Tun in her, and under the number of twenty
<pb facs="tcp:57005:31"/>
Tuns, then the King is to have one Tun only; but if the Ship containeth twenty Tuns and more, then the King is to have two Tuns, the one to be taken behind the Mad, and the other before the Maſt, the King paying for the portage twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>Certa priſa.</hi> Thirdly, it is to be obſerved that is not a duty newly encroached, for it hath by cuſtom (time out of mind of man) been taken; for the ancienteſt Records now remaining with us do make mention of the payment of it; for in the Pat. Rol. aforementioned being in the 40<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third it is ſpoken of; and <hi>Fleta</hi> who wrote in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">

according as they are aſſigned for the gathering of cuſtomes within I certain bounds, that they twice yearly ſhall certifie the Treaſurer and Barons how many Ships have arrived within their bounds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And how many Ships arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of whom the King did take priſage of Wine, and how many Tunnes, and in what Ships the King did take twoſh. for the Tun. And for the other price. And in the Pat. Rol. extant in 20. <hi>R.</hi> 2. you <note place="margin">20. <hi>R.</hi> 2. Rot.

which Immunity granted unto them, the Merchant-ſtrangers by way of thankful reſtitution granted unto the King and his Succeſſours, that he ſhould have two ſh. of every Tun of Wine brought in by them within fourty dayes after it is brought into the Port, the which two ſh. is called by the name of Butlerage, becauſe the Kings Chief Butler by reaſon of his Office is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. And thoſe ſubject of the Kings who do buy Wines beyond the Seas for their own ſpending, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny intention to Merchandize, ought not to pay priſage for thoſe Wines. Sixthly, it is expreſſed of all Wines brought from beyond the Seas; for that if Wines ſhould be made in <hi>England.</hi> as in times paſt they have been (as it appeareth by an ancient Record in <hi>Windſor-Caſtle,</hi> where it is ſaid that the Parſon had ten pound for the Tythe of Claret-Wine mad there) and they ſhould be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from one Port to another to be ſold, no priſage ſhall be paid for them. Laſtly, it is deſcribed which hath uſed to be taken, and not which hath uſed to be paid by the owners, and Merchants of the Wines, and the <hi>Etymology</hi> of the
<pb facs="tcp:57005:33"/>
word importeth as much. For <hi>Priſae</hi> being the Latine word for priſage, hath it's name of <hi>prendere,</hi> and is no more than <hi>Prizel,</hi> which is taking, and is a Participle of the word <hi>Prendere,</hi> which may be applied to all manner of takings; howſoever here it is only limited to the taking of Wines.</p>
                        <p>As to the ſecond part, which is what <note place="margin">2. The ground of paying the K. pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</note> is the cauſe, and ground of the payment of priſage, there is not any Record to be ſeen which manifeſteth the original cauſe of the payment of it; but it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably conjectured that for as much as the King of <hi>England</hi> is King of the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Seas, and hath been alwayes at a perpetual charge in the maintaining of Ships for the defence of his Merchants, and protecting of them from the cruel ſpoile of the Pyrates, and in ſcouring the Seas to make their paſſage the more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure; therefore in recompence and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of this care, and charge, the Merchants have always uſed (time out of mind) to give an allowance unto the King, and his Officers for the taking of this priſage of Wines for the better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of his houſhold, the which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, and uſage being continued
<pb facs="tcp:57005:33"/>
time out of mind, hath made it to be a duty unto the King, and likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the King hath uſed to take one Tun out of ten Tuns, and two Tuns out of twenty Tuns (for in ancient time, the Ships that went for theſe Wines being no great Voyage, were not of much greater burden) ſome have conceived that this was in nature of a Tythe, paid unto the King, and as the particular Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, which miniſtreth ſpiritual things for the Food of the Soul, hath of right the tenth part of his clear gains due unto him: So the King in that proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Parens patriae,</hi> and the general Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor of all his Subjects, protecting their lives and goods from violent oppreſſion upon the Seas hath received, and taken the tenth part of the Wines brought in. But this only conjectured, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I cannot warrant it to be a ſure Foundation to build on.</p>
                        <p>As to the third, which is, at what time priſage is ſaid to be due. I do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <note place="margin">3. When pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage is due.</note> find ſome doubt to be made of it; for ſome Judges (unto whoſe Learning, and Judgement becauſe of their Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Ed. Crook,</hi> Sir <hi>John Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge.</hi>
                           </note> parts, and ſingular induſtry, much reverence is to be aſcribed) have been
<pb facs="tcp:57005:34"/>
of opinion that before ſuch time as the bulk of the Ship be broken up, or that it be arrived at the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Port, priſage is due, and therefore if a Ship after ſuch time as it is come up into the Haven, finding that Wines will not bear any price, doth before the Bulk of the Ship be broken, depart out of the Harbour, and go back beyond the Seas, and there vent thoſe Wines. The King, this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, may require his priſage at the Merchants hands; for the narrow Seas being within the Alleageance of the King of <hi>England,</hi> as it appeareth by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of our year-Books, ſo ſoon as the <note place="margin">6. <hi>R.</hi> 2. 46.</note> Ships come upon them, there is the duty of priſage accrued unto the King, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it doth not lie in the power of the Merchant to defeat him; and alſo the very nature of priſage being to have one Tun before the Maſt, and one other Tun behind the Maſt, ſheweth that the King hath an Election to take his Tuns of Wine where he will, the which may not be, if the duty of priſage ſhould ariſe out of the breaking of the Bulk for when the Bulk is broken, how doth it appear which is the Tun before the Maſt, and which is the Tun behind the
<pb facs="tcp:57005:34"/>
Maſt? So as the King may have the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection to take his priſage, as the Law giveth it unto him; and they are of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that if a Ship come into the Port laden with Wines, that the King is not to expect his priſage where the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant will unlade his Wines; for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a certain duty accrued unto the King upon the coming into the Port, he may take it at the Port, and is not bound to wait upon the Merchant from one Port unto another, untill he will or can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lade his Ship: But the reſidue of the Juſtices which argued in this caſe, were of opinion, that priſage is not due, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Bulk of the Ship be broken; ſo as that if the Merchant after his arrival at the Port, will go unto another Port, the King may not take his priſage before ſuch time as they come unto that Port where they unlade; and their opinion was grounded upon the reaſons follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that is to ſay; Firſt, becauſe the reaſon and ground of the payment of priſage, being the ſecurity which the Merchants enjoy by, and through the care and charge of the King upon the narrow Seas, they ought to be ſecured of that benefit, before ſuch time as
<pb facs="tcp:57005:35"/>
they ſhall be forced to pay the duty; and before the breaking of the Bulk of the Ship, they are not aſcertained of their ſafe conduct, inſomuch that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they be in the Port or Harbour, yet they may have cauſe to put out into the Main again, as if they were driven in there through danger of Pyrates, or violence of Tempeſts, their Cocquet ſhewing their courſe to be bent unto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place, and it is no reaſon that the K. ſhould take his duty before ſuch time as the Merchant be aſſured of his protection. Secondly, incertainties are always odious in Law; for they are the Mother of confuſion, whereas the Law expecteth and requireth order: And if the time expreſſed be alwayes ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or doubtful, it is careful in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining and ſetting of it down cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly; and for the moſt part where it is left to her conſtruction, ſhe giveth the longeſt time for the doing of it, whereby beſt advantage may be given unto the party which is to do it, the which may be manifeſt by divers inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of caſes ſet down in our Books which I do purpoſely omit to avoid too much prolixity; Wherefore it being the
<pb facs="tcp:57005:35"/>
moſt certain, and the moſt equal time both for the King and Merchant to have the priſage taken when the Bulk of the Ship is broken; the Law, to whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction it is left, ſhall rather ordain the taking of it to be then, than at any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time; for if the Law ſhould ſay, that it is a duty preſently upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the narrow Seas, it ſhould ſay, it is a duty before ſuch time as the Merchant can aſſure himſelf they are his Wines to diſpoſe, inſomuch that before the coming into Harbour, they may be ſwallowed up by the Seas, or he may be diſpoiled of them by Enemies unto the King, or Rebels unto the State. And if the Law ſhould determine the duty to the King when the Ships are ſafely in the Harbour, there might a great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience enſue upon this Judgement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may very well be, that their courſe was intended to another place, and they were driven in there only by miſadventure, and it would be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous to have the Ship rifled, and their Wines diſordered, before they had attained unto the intended Haven. Thirdly, this opinion is conſonant unto the Judgements in former times; for it
<pb facs="tcp:57005:36"/>
was ruled in the caſe of one <hi>Kenniston,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Kenniſton.</note> and <hi>Boggius,</hi> in the fifth year of his Majeſties Reign that now is, that priſage ſhall not be ſaid to be due until ſuch time as the Bulk be broken, and the Ship unladen. And likewiſe there is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, by which it appeareth, that the King is to have Priſage of every Ship bringing VVine into <hi>England</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laden thereof, ſo as if it be not unladen then the King by that Record is not to have Priſage. Beſides, it appeareth by the Record concerning the payment of Butlerage by the Merchant Aliens, that the King is to have there two ſhillings of them for every Tun within fourty dayes after the unlading; ſo as the Law pointeth at the unlading; whereſore this Priſage differing only becauſe the VVines are paid <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> it ſhall be an Argument thus far to perſwade, that the Law will not appoint the time of taking the Wines <hi>in ſpecie</hi> before the unlading, when it giveth for the payment of the two ſhillings until ſourty dayes after the unlading.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, it was reſolved that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <note place="margin">4. Whether the King may grant, or diſcharge Priſage.</note> Priſage of Wines is a Flower of the Crown, yet is it not ſuch an inſepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb facs="tcp:57005:36"/>
Flower of the Crown, but that it may well enough be granted over, for it is a matter of profit and benefit which is to redound unto the King, and it is not of the nature of a Purachans meerly, for that it is inſeperably an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed in privity unto the perſon of the King, that it may not be granted over. And accordingly it was reſolved in the caſe of Sir <hi>Thomas Vavaſor,</hi> who mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <note place="margin">41. <hi>Elix.</hi>
                           </note> one of the Daughters of Alderman <hi>Houghton,</hi> who had a Grant of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage made unto him. And in the 15. of <hi>E.</hi> 4. in the Patent-Rolls it appeareth, that one <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> had <note place="margin">15 <hi>E</hi> 4. Rot. Pat.</note> a Grant made unto him, and by the ſame reaſon that a Grant may be made of Priſage, <hi>à fortiori</hi> may there be a Grant made unto certain perſons to diſcharge them of the payment of it; for it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier to make one capable in point of diſcharge, than by way of Grant, and the Charter made to the Merchants Strangers for the diſcharge of the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Priſage. And the Statute of 1. <hi>H</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. ſheweth that a Charter made for the diſcharge of Priſage, is well, and allowable,</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, this Grant made unto the <note place="margin">5. Grant to a body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique for the benefit of bodies natural. 39 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 21. 21 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 55.</note>

Mayor and Commonalty, and their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, <hi>Quod de vinis civium nulla priſa fiat,</hi> is good enough, and the grant may well enough be made unto a body poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, and the benefit of the Patent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed unto a body natural; for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of that nature are uſual in the year-Book of the Common Laws of this our Realm, and never any exception taken unto them when there hath been leſs warrant in reaſon to make them good, then there is for this our Patent which we have here in hand: For the City of <hi>London</hi> being the Metropolitan City of this Land, the which may well be called the Heart and Epitome of the whole Realm, and the Chamber of the King, the Merchants whereof do fill the Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of the Prince by their cuſtomes, and do ſupply the Subjects of his Majeſty with all manner of neceſſaries, do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the honour of their Nation by their Commerce, and Traffique abroad, and do ſtrengthen the whole body of it by ſhipping, which are termed the wooden Walls. It is reaſon that all Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters made in their favour, and giving them Immunities and Priviledges, ſhould receive a benigne interpretation, and the
<pb facs="tcp:57005:37"/>
more eſpecially alſo, becauſe at this time all Merchants ſtrangers had a Charter of diſcharge for the payment of priſage, but only that they were to pay two ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in the Tun; and ſo if the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of <hi>London</hi> ſhould not have had a Charter of diſcharge, they would have been diſcouraged from trading for Wines, becauſe the Merchants ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers would have been able to have afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Wines at eaſier rates, becauſe they were freed of ſome part of that charge, which the Engliſh Merchants were burthened with.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, as to the Declaration, what perſons ſhall be diſcharged of the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">6. Whatper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the words of the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> of priſage within the words of this Charter, it will be the better manifeſted by ſhewing the deſtinctions and degrees of Citizens which are to be found, for there is mention made of five manner of Citizens. The firſt of which is, he <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sort.</hi> Citizens of five ſorts.</note> that is a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> for the bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of offices in the City, and ſuch ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial intents, becauſe he is a Freeman of the City, but he is not a Citizen in reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and continuance in the City; for he inhabiteth and dwelleth out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſuch a Citizen as this, is not
<pb facs="tcp:57005:38"/>
ſuch a Citizen as ſhall enjoy the benefit and priviledge to be diſcharged of the payment of priſage, according to the reſolution given in the Exchequer in the Caſe of one <hi>Knolls. Trin.</hi> 4. <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>Rot.</hi> 14. where it was ruled, that one that was a Citizen and Freeman of <hi>London</hi> but dwelt in <hi>Bristol,</hi> might not partake of the benefit of this Charter, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that he by reaſon of his dwelling out of the City, was only a Citizen to a ſpecial intent. The ſecond ſort of <note place="margin">2. <hi>Sort.</hi>
                           </note> Citizens are thoſe which are Citizens in reſpect of their Freedome, and likewiſe in regard of reſidence within the City, but are not ſuch Citizens as do keep a Family and Houſhold within the City, but are Inmates and Sojourners, and they do harbour themſelves under the Roof of another, and a Citizen of this nature, is not a Citizen which is capable of the Immunity granted by this Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for the diſcharge of payment of priſage, according to the reſolution gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the Exchequer, in the caſe of one <hi>Snead</hi> and <hi>Sacheneril.

                           <hi>commodum.</hi> The third ſort of Citizens are thoſe which do inhabit, reſide, and <note place="margin">3. <hi>Sort.</hi>
                           </note> keep a Family in the City, but they are not Freemen of the City, ſo as they may be choſen in any office, and undergo the charge of the City; and as well as the Common Law doth exclude ſuch Citizens for deviſing Lands in <hi>Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maigne</hi>

                           <hi>London,</hi> as appeareth by divers Book-Caſes, as well ſhall the Common Law ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them from enjoyning the benefit of the Charter to be diſcharged of the payment of priſage. The fourth ſort of Citizens, are thoſe which are both Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, <note place="margin">4. <hi>Sort.</hi>
                           </note> and Freemen, and do reſide, and keep family in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and they are not continuing Citizens at ſuch time as the Bulk is broken, and the Ship unladen; for they were disfranchiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Theſe Citizens likewiſe ſhall not enjoy the exemption granted for the diſcharge of the payment of Priſage: inſomuch that they were not continuing Citizens at that time as the priſage ought to be taken. The fifth ſort of Citizens, are thoſe which are both Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, <note place="margin">5. <hi>Sort.</hi>
                           </note> and Freemen, and have their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
<pb facs="tcp:57005:39"/>
and dwelling in <hi>London,</hi> and do continue Citizens at ſuch time as priſage, ought to be taken: Now Citizens of this kind are the real, proper, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Citizens intended by this Charter, which are to be diſcharged of priſage; and therefore a Woman which is a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of this kind, howſoever ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear offices in the City as a Citize<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, is yet intended by the Charter: And yet alſo in ſome caſes, Citizens of this kind ſhall not be intended within the words of this Charter; and therefore if the Mayor and Commonalty have a joynt Stock of Wines come into the Port of <hi>London,</hi> now priſage ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of theſe Wine, not withſtanding that every of them in their proper perſons Citizens, both <hi>reſidentiâ, familiâ,</hi> and <hi>continuatione;</hi> for reſpect is not to be had to their natural bodies, but to their politique body, in which capacity the Charter will not extend to them. So if one at the time, that he fraughteth a Ship, be not a Citizen in all the degrees, now howſoever afterwards before the return of the Ship he be enabled in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reſpect, yet he ſhall not enjoy the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Charter, inſomuch that he
<pb facs="tcp:57005:39"/>
was not ſo at that time that the Ship was ſent abroad.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly and laſtly, what Wines ſhall be diſcharged of the payment of <note place="margin">7. What Wines are diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</note> priſage, it will better appear by the conſideration had of the ſeveral kinds of properties; and therefore he that ſhall have his Wines diſcharged of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage ought to have a property in them, <hi>quarto modo,</hi> that is, <hi>ſibi ſolùm &amp; ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;</hi> and alſo he ought to have <hi>jus poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſionis</hi> and <hi>jus proprietatis,</hi> and the one without the other will not ſerve the turn; and therefore if a Citizen and Forreigner be joynt Merchants for Wines, now the Wines of theſe joynt Merchants ſhall not be diſcharged of the payment of priſage, inſomuch that the Citizen hath not a ſole property in them, and it may not be diſtingniſhed which of the Wines belong unto the Citizen, and which to the Forreigner, becauſe of their joynt intereſt. But if two Citizens be joynt Merchants or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants in common of Wines, now theſe Wines ſhall be within the compaſs of the Charter to be diſcharged of priſage, becauſe they are the Wines of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of <hi>London,</hi> according to the words
<pb facs="tcp:57005:40"/>
and intent of the Charter; howſoever neither of them have a ſole intereſt and property in them. And if a Citizen and Freeman of <hi>London</hi> hath Wines pledged unto him by another Citizen and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Now theſe Wines upon their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home ſhall not be diſcharged of the payment of priſage, inſomuch that the Citizen hath only a ſpecial property in them, and not any abſolute property. So if a Forreigner that hath fraughted Ships beyond the Seas for the bringing of Wines into <hi>England,</hi> doth make a Citizen of <hi>London</hi> his Executor, and die, and the Ship cometh into the Port; now theſe Wines thus in the cuſtody of the Citizen ſhall not be diſcharged of the payment of priſage, for as much as the Citizen hath only a property in the Wines to the uſe, and behoof of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner, and hath not any abſolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in the Wines. And if one Citizen of <hi>London</hi> that hath Wines abroad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>England,</hi> do make a Forreigner his Executor, and dieth, and this forreign Executor doth imploy the Stock that cometh of theſe wines ſo returned home after the death of him that ſet them forth, and Wines are returned home, now how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb facs="tcp:57005:40"/>
theſe laſt Wines ſo returned into <hi>England</hi> are Aſſets in the hands of the Executor, and in Appellation are the Goods of the firſt Citizen, yet they are ſuch Wines as are capable of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of priſage within the words of, the Charter, becauſe theſe Wines came in <note place="margin">1. <hi>H.</hi> 8. cap. 5.</note> as it were upon a new contract. And if a Citizen do buy Wines with an intent that a Forreigner upon their coming home ſhall have theſe Wines, now theſe Wines ſhall not be diſcharged of priſage, and this deceit of buying them by a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen, ſhall not any wayes avail him, no more then if a Citizen buy Cloth, in <hi>London</hi> for a Forreigner he ſhall defeat the cuſtome of Forreign bought, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign ſold, to avoid the Forfeiture of them. So the Wines which a Forreigner buyeth of a Citizen; or that a Citizen buyeth of a Forreigner, ſhall not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of priſage within the words of the Charter, becauſe they were not the Wines of a Citizen alwayes, from the time of the lading of them, until the time of the unlading of them, as they ought to be.</p>

Adventurers ſtanding at a gaze, as being uncertain of what validity the old Patent would be, did ſlack to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant the <hi>Diers,</hi> and other Tradeſmen out of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> being neceſſary Inſtruments for the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Execution of this deſign, becauſe there were not here in <hi>England</hi> thoſe that were able to Die and Dreſs, in that manner that the <hi>Low-Country</hi> men did. And ſo there was in the <hi>interim</hi> a ſtop of the current of Merchandizing with our Cloth, the which being the <hi>principal Commodity</hi> that we had here in <hi>England;</hi> the Fleece that cauſeth it, may well and aptly have the term of, <hi>The Golden Fleece;</hi> and there being a ſtop made of the traffiquing and trading with theſe clothes, it is as dangerous unto the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique Body</hi> of the Commonwealth, as the ſtop of a Vein could be to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Body; for as by the ſtop of a Vein the Blood is debarred of his free paſſage, and ſo of neceſſity there muſt be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption by the continuance of it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low unto the body natural: So traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique being the Blood which runneth in the Veins of the Commonwealth, it cannot be but that the hinderance of it
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57005:48"/>
by any long continuance, muſt breed a Conſumption unto the State of the Commonwealth; Wherefore, to open this Vein, which was as yet ſomewhat ſtopped, and to give a more free paſſage unto the Blood, he was a Suitor unto the Court, on the behalf of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>New Merchant-Adventurers,</hi> that the Court would give expedition in this Caſe; for they conceived, that if this new deſign might take its full effect, as it was intended, it could not be, but of neceſſity there muſt a great benefit redound to the Commonwealth.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, Whereas there happeneth <note place="margin">3.</note> often a confiſcation of all our Clothes, and much diſgrace and diſcredit lighteth upon our Nation, and our Clothes, by the abuſe of the <hi>Low-Country-men,</hi> in ſtretching them a greater length than they will well bear, when they Dye and Dreſs them; now it ſhould be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when they ſhould never have the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering of them, to put that abuſe in practice: Wherefore this Patent made by King <hi>Edw.</hi> the 3. bereaving the King and Commonwealth of theſe great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and commodities, is againſt the Law and ſo ought to be repealed.

                     <p>That is to ſay, that King <hi>H.</hi> 6. in the 23. year of his Reign by his Letters Patents, bearing the ſame date, did grant unto the Mayor, Aldermen, and Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> that they ſhould not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled upon any Writ directed unto them, to certifie the Indictments themſelves, taken before them, but only the Tenors
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57005:50"/>
of them, the which they have done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; and Exception being taken unto this Return for the inſufficiency of it; it was reſolved by Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Crook,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Doddridg,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Haughton,</hi> that the return, upon the reaſons hereafter following, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient.</p>
                     <p>For firſt, the Letters Patents being granted unto them by the name of the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rat.</hi> 1.</note> Mayor, Aldermen, and Sheriffs of the City of <hi>London,</hi> warranteth only the not certifying of Indictments taken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, as Mayor, Aldermen, and Sheriffs of <hi>London;</hi> and where the Writ is directed unto them by that name, and they do not excuſe them, in Caſe where the Writ is directed unto them as Juſtices of <hi>Peace,</hi> and where the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments are taken before them as Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of <hi>Peace,</hi> by virtue of the Kings Commiſſion. And howſoever the Mayor and Aldermen are Juſtices of Peace by Charter, yet inſomuch that they are diſtinct powers, return made by them by the name of Mayor and Aldermen, where the Writ is directed unto them (as Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of Peace) will not be good.</p>

Secondly, there being a Reſumption <note place="margin">2.

                     <p>Thirdly, the Letters Patents of the King being the ſole ground and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">3.</note> to make the return good, are not ſufficiently returned unto the Court, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that it was ſaid upon the return only, that the King by his Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents did grant unto the Mayor. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty, and Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> that they ſhould not be compelled to certifie the Indictments themſelves; but it doth
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57005:51"/>
not appear, that they were ſealed with the Grand Seal, and if they were not ſealed with that Seal, the Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents may not be of any validity in Law, howſoever they were ſealed with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer Seal, or Dutchy Seal, in reſpect of which, they may well be called the Letters Pattents of the King.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the uſe hath alwayes been to remove Indictments, and the Record <note place="margin">4.</note> of them upon a <hi>Certiorari</hi> awarded out of the Kings Bench, and there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any denial made of it before this time; and in 5. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. where a <hi>Certiora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri</hi> was directed unto them for the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of an Indictment of a Woman which was Indicted for being a common Whore, the Indictment was certified in obedience unto the Writ, although in the end of the return, they ſhewed their Charter, and prayed that it might be remanded, becauſe it was an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment only warrantable by the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the City, and not by the Common Law: And the Court was of opinion in the return at the Bar, to have impoſed a Fine, and to have awarded a third <hi>Certiorari,</hi> but it was ſtayed, and the ſecond return was amended.</p>

                     <p>THe cuſtome of <hi>London</hi> is, that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Freeman deviſeth and, or other <note place="margin">Hill. 13. K.

The Widow of a Freeman of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> dwelling in <hi>Middleſex,</hi> bequeathed a Legacy of a thouſand pound unto her Daughter after all Debts and Legacies

paid, and upon condition that ſhe ſhould not marry without the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of her Executor, and maketh a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man her Executor, and dieth. The Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor is convented before the Court of Mayor and Aldermen, and required to put in Sureties unto the <hi>Chamberlain</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> according to the Cuſtome for the payment of a thouſand pound, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto the time limited by the Will, and according to the Will afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. The Executor denieth to find Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; whereupon he was committed to priſon, and a <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded out of the Court of <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> to have the Body of the Executor, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the cauſe; all this matter appeareth upon the return. And now it was moved by <hi>Richard Martin</hi> late Recorder of <hi>London,</hi> then an Apprentice of the Law, that the return was inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and ſo the Executor ought to be enlarged.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, in regard that the ground of the impriſonment was the Cuſtome of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>

                           <hi>Rat.</hi> 1.</note> and the cuſtome is againſt the Law, and void, inſomuch that it enforceth an Executor to find Sureties for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Legacy, according unto the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57005:53"/>
Will, where the law requireth, that debts be paid, before ſuch time as Legacies be performed; and the Law giveth an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unto the Executor, to pay which of the Legacies he will, in caſe there be not ſufficient to pay all the debts and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies of the Teſtator; but this excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was diſallowed by the ſaid Court, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the cuſtome of <hi>London</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the return to be, that he ſhall find Sureties for the performance of the Legacies according unto the Law of the Realm, and the Will of the Teſtator: So as if the Executor had not ſufficient to pay debts, and legacies, he hath the ſame power and liberty after ſuch time as he hath found Sureties, as he had before.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, except on was taken, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it appeared by the return, that the Deviſor was a woman, and alſo only the Wife of a Freeman, and not a Free-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and ſhe is not within the cuſtom of <hi>London,</hi> which only ſpeaketh of a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. But this exception was over-ruled; for a woman being a Free-woman with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta cap.</hi> 29. which enacteth, that no Freeman ſhall be taken or impriſoned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but by the lawful judgement of his Peers: So that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57005:53"/>
ſhe being a Barroneſs or Counteſs ſhall be tried by her Peers upon an Indictment preferred againſt her, ſhe ſhall alſo be reputed a Freeman within this cuſtome.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Wife of a Freeman ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the liberty and priviledge to Trade in the City, and ſo able to take benefit by it, ſhe ſhall alſo be bound by the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, howſoever ſhe was dwelling out of <hi>London</hi> at the time of the Will made, ſhe is a Freeman within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of the cuſtome.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, it was objected, that this cuſtome of <hi>London</hi> concerning Orphans, was an antiquated cuſtome, and had not been put in uſe by many years, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought not now to be put in ure to take away the liberty of a man, and eſpecially alſo, becauſe the life of a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome is the uſage; but this exception was over-ruled, for this cuſtome is day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put in Ure.</p>

That <hi>London</hi> is an ancient City, and, that time out of mind of man, the Mayor, Aldermen, and Citizens of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> have had Conuſans of all manner of

                     <p>As to the firſt part, which is, whether by the Common Law, any thing can be <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. What the Parſon may by Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for houſes in <hi>London? Fitz. Herb. nat. brev. fol.</hi> 53.</note> demanded for the houſes in <hi>London?</hi> It is to be agreed, and clear that nothing can be demanded. For that which the Parſon ought to demand of houſes, is Tythes; and it is improper, and cannot be, that Tythes can be paid of houſes. Firſt, in regard that houſes do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and renew, but rather decreaſe for want of reparations, and Tythes are not to be paid of any thing, but ſuch things as do increaſe, and renew; as it appeareth by the Levitical Law, and the Common Law of the Land. Secondly, houſes are matters of inheritance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a <hi>praecipe</hi> lieth at the Common Law. And the rent reſerved upon a Leaſe made of them, is likewiſe knit unto the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, and parcel of it; ſo that it ſhall go along unto him that hath the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance; and therefore ſhall deſcend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he Heir: and it is a rule in Law that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57005:59"/>
Tythes are not to be paid of part of the Inheritance, but they ought to be paid of ſuch things as renew; upon which reaſon it is that Tythes by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law of the Land are not to be paid of Slate, Stone, and Cole digged out of the Pit. Thirdly, houſes being built only for the receiving, habitation, and dweling of men, and for conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of protection againſt the ſcorching Heats in Summer, and tempeſtuous Storms in Winter, without any profit at all redounding unto the owner. And the Parſon being to have a benefit o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, in the payment of perſonal Tythes ariſing through his induſtry in the houſe, no Tythes can be demanded for the houſes themſelves, or for the rent reſerved upon them. Fourthly, the Decree made 38. <hi>H.</hi> 8. which exempteth the houſes of Noblemen from the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any rate-Tythes, ſheweth the Common Law to be, ſo that houſes of themſelves are to be diſcharged of the payment of Tythes, and accordingly it <note place="margin">34. <hi>Eliz. Dawſons</hi> caſe K. Bench.</note> hath been adjudged in divers caſes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the Common Law: that Tythes by the courſe of the Common Laws may not be demanded for houſes, but they are to be diſcharged.</p>

                        <pb n="62" facs="tcp:57005:60"/>
As to the ſecond point, which is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">2.</note> cuſtom can eſtabliſh a right of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any thing unto the Paſon for houſes? It is clear that it may well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: for it may well be, that before ſuch time as any houſe was built upon the ground where the houſe ſtood, there had been a ſumme of money paid for the profits of the ground in the name of a <hi>modus decimandi,</hi> and ſo howſoever the houſe is built upon the ground, yet the <hi>modus</hi> continues, and is not taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by it; and ſo there being a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of payment of the <hi>modus</hi> after the building of the houſe, time hath made it to be a payment for the houſe. But this payment is to be termed a <hi>modus decimandi,</hi> and cannot be well called a Tithe paid for houſes, becauſe as it is formerly ſaid, Tithes may not be paid for houſes; and all this appeareth by <note place="margin">11. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. ſol. 16.</note> Doctor <hi>Grants</hi> caſe in the eleventh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
                     <p>As to the third point, which is, what <note place="margin">3. What was anciently paid for houſes in <hi>London</hi> to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> was anciently paid by the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> unto the Miniſters of <hi>London</hi> and how the payment grew?

paſs, or deſcend with it, it ſhall not be extinguiſhed by the purchaſe of the houſe not ſuſpended by an entry in the houſe, nor apportioned by an eviction of part of the houſe. Thirdly, the party himſelf in his Indenture of Leaſe hath called it a Fine, and Income, and hath expreſſed the days of payment for it, as a Fine and Income; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now it may not well be ſaid to be a rent either in the judgement of the Common Laws, or Eccleſiaſtial Laws, or in common accepration.</p>
                     <p>As to the fifth part which is, whether this twenty five pounds by the year, thus <note place="margin">5.

K, <hi>H</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 12? It was conceived by thoſe that argued on the behalf of the Miniſters of <hi>London,</hi> upon the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons hereafter following that the reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of twenty five pounds by the year, by way of Income, was a rent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the meaning of the Decree, and that the Plaintiff ought to have the rate-Tythes paid unto him, according to the proportion of thirty pounds by the year, and not according unto the rate of five
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57005:63"/>
pounds by the year only; Firſt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that this Fine being profit which ariſeth by reaſon of the houſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing payable at the ſame times, that the firſt five pounds (which without queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a rent) is payable, and upon the ſame conditions may well be ſaid a rent; both out of the Etymology of the word, by common acceptation of the thing, by the judgement both of Common Laws, and of the Laws of the Church and ſo is a rent within the intent of the Decree; and the nameing of it a Fine, or Income ſhall not cauſe an evaſion out of the Law. Secondly, this Decree, and Act of Parliament being made for the avail of the Church, and ſetling of the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue thereof; ſhall have as liberal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to give life unto the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and meaning of it, as may be, and the ſlight of payment of it, as a groſs ſum by way of Fine and Income upon a Covenant made by <hi>Goff</hi> the Leaſſee, ſhall not defeat the good proviſion made by the Decree. Thirdly, this 2. ſh 9 d. in the pound being the labourers hire, and given him in ſatisfaction and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of all manner of Tythes, either perſonal, predial, or mixt, the Decree
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57005:64"/>
made concerning it, ought to be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and enlarged ſo far, as by reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able expoſition it may, and is not any wayes to be reſtrained, whereby to give way to any cautelous proviſion made by the party. Fourthly, the Common Law, and Statutes having all with one voice, condemned fraud, covin, and deceit uſed in any manner of kind or way, and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying themſelves againſt it, whereby to extirpate and root it out of the hearts of all; and to prevent it from being put in Ure in the actions of any man; It is great reaſon in this caſe, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth God, the Church, Religion, and Learning, to ſuppreſs all manner of Acts which may any way have a taſte, or touch of fraud. Wherefore this Fine, or Income thus reſerved by way of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, having the appearance of fraud, ſhall be taken to be a rent, within the intent, and meaning of the Decree; and way ſhall not be given to this device, whereby to defeat the Church and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters <note place="margin">Argument on the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens part.</note> of it of their due. But thoſe that argued on the behalf of the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> were of opinion that this Fine, and Income was not within the intent and meaning of the Decree; for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree

being that the Citizens and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſame for the time being ſhall yearly for ever without fraud, or covin, pay their Tythes to the Parſons, Vicars, Curates of the ſaid City and their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors for the time being, after the rate hereafter following; that is, to wit, of every ten ſhillings rent by the year, of all, and every Houſe, and Houſes, Shops, Warehouſes, Cellars, and Stables within the ſaid City, and Liberty of the ſame, ſixteen pence half-penny, and of every 20. ſh. rent of all and every ſuch Houſe, and Houſes, Shops, Wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And where any Leaſe is, or ſhall be made of any dwelling houſe or houſes, ſhops, ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, cellars, or ſtables or any of them, by fraud, or covin, reſerving leſs rent then hath been accuſtomed, or is, or that any ſuch Leaſe ſhall be made without any rent reſerved upon the ſame by reaſon of any Fine, or Income paid before hand or by ay fraud, or covin, that then, and in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57005:65"/>
every ſuch caſe the Tenant or Farmer; Tenants or Farmers thereof ſhall pay his or their Tythes of the ſame, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the quantity of ſuch rent, or rents, as the ſame houſe, or houſes, ſhops, ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, cellars, ſtables, or any of them were laſt letten, without Fraud or Covin, before the making of ſuch a Leaſe. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that the Decree aimeth at a rent, and not at a Fine, or Income, for within the words above mentioned, it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that there is a difference, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction made between a Fine, and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and the intent of the maker of the Decree, is beſt drawn and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the words of the Decree, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Party Leaſſee having expreſſed himſelf that this twenty five pounds by the year, ſhall be paid in name of a Fine, and Income. And the Decree it ſelf ſhewing that by reaſon of a Fine, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, leſs rent is reſerved, it may not be ſaid that this twenty five pounds by the year, ſhall be a rent within the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Decree, when there is a rent of five pounds alſo reſeſerved, beſide this Income. Secondly, this Decree made in 37. <hi>H.</hi> 8. being penal unto the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> becauſe it inflicteth impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57005:65"/>
upon him, upon his non-payment of his Tythe according to the rent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and being alſo in advantage of the Miniſters of <hi>London</hi> becauſe, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this Decree, the Miniſter is to have according to the rate of 2. ſh. 9. d. in every twenty ſhillings, where ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he had but 2. s. 6. d. it is no reaſon to extend it by equity, and to conſtrue that to be a rent within the intent and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Decree, which of it ſelf is a Fne, or Income. Thirdly, there never hauing been above the rent of five <note place="margin">3.</note> pounds by the year, reſerved upon any Leaſe made, it cannot be taken to be any covin, or colluſion. When the ancient rent is reſerved, inſomuch, that now ſo much as the Law requireth, is done and beſides where the Common Law or Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Law ſhall take notice of a Fraud, it ought to be in caſe where the thing in which the Fraud, or deceit was ſuppoſed, is formerly in being; for a Fraud may not be committed to a perſon, or thing not in being. Fourthly, it is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, ſo that if no rent at all had been reſerved, there might not any more have been demanded, but only according to the rate of the rent, which was laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57005:66"/>
for the houſes; wherefore the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient rent of 5. l. being here reſerved, it cannot be, that within the intent and meaning of the Decree there can be more rate-Tythes demanded, then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that rent. And beſides the very words of the Decree, intimates that there is no fraud within the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Decree, but only where by reaſon of the Fine, or Income, there is not rent at all reſerved, or a leſs rent then was anciently reſerved; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore in the Caſe at the Barre, the old rent being reſerved, there may be no fraud at all.</p>
                     <p>As to the ſixth, and laſt part, which is, who ſhall be Judge of the payment of Tythes for houſes in <hi>London,</hi> and the remedy for the recovery of them? It is apparent out of the words of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, that the Mayor of the City of <hi>London</hi> is Judge, and is to give or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der concerning them; and Suit is not to be made in the Eccleſiaſtical Court for them; and if it be, a Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to be granted, inſomuch, that the party grieved reſorteth unto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Judge then the Statute hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. But if the Mayor do not
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57005:66"/>
give aid within two moneths after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint made, or do not give ſuch aid as is fitting; then reſort is to be made unto the Lord Chancellour of <hi>England,</hi> who hath three moneths given him for ending of the ſaid Cauſe.</p>
